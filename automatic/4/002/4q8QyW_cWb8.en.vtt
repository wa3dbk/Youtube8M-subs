00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.750 

all<00:00:01.050> right<00:00:01.170> so<00:00:01.319> one<00:00:01.680> more<00:00:01.709> problem<00:00:02.550> here

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
all right so one more problem here

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.550 
all right so one more problem here
related<00:00:03.149> to<00:00:03.179> limits<00:00:03.750> and<00:00:03.959> this<00:00:04.140> is<00:00:04.259> actually

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
related to limits and this is actually

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.539 
related to limits and this is actually
gonna<00:00:04.650> have<00:00:04.770> a<00:00:04.830> little<00:00:05.069> bit<00:00:05.160> to<00:00:05.370> do<00:00:05.520> with

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
gonna have a little bit to do with

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.179 
gonna have a little bit to do with
continuity<00:00:06.240> so<00:00:07.200> we<00:00:07.379> want<00:00:07.529> to<00:00:07.589> figure<00:00:07.740> out<00:00:07.830> what

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
continuity so we want to figure out what

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.879 
continuity so we want to figure out what
value<00:00:08.670> of<00:00:08.700> a<00:00:09.090> is<00:00:09.420> this<00:00:09.840> piecewise<00:00:10.349> function

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
value of a is this piecewise function

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.370 
value of a is this piecewise function
continuous<00:00:11.519> on<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:11.790> entire<00:00:12.150> real<00:00:12.780> line<00:00:12.809> so

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
continuous on the entire real line so

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.320 
continuous on the entire real line so
we've<00:00:14.130> got<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.370> piecewise<00:00:14.730> function<00:00:15.150> x

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
we've got the piecewise function x

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.540 
we've got the piecewise function x
squared<00:00:15.570> plus<00:00:15.750> 3<00:00:16.080> if<00:00:16.170> X<00:00:16.410> is<00:00:16.560> less<00:00:16.619> than<00:00:16.980> 1<00:00:17.250> and

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
squared plus 3 if X is less than 1 and

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.599 
squared plus 3 if X is less than 1 and
then<00:00:18.000> we<00:00:18.090> have<00:00:18.119> a<00:00:18.359> X<00:00:18.690> plus<00:00:19.140> 6<00:00:19.529> if<00:00:20.100> X<00:00:20.369> is<00:00:20.490> greater

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
then we have a X plus 6 if X is greater

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.140 
then we have a X plus 6 if X is greater
than<00:00:20.970> or<00:00:21.180> equal<00:00:21.359> to<00:00:21.570> 1<00:00:21.840> so<00:00:22.580> we've<00:00:23.580> seen<00:00:23.880> this

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
than or equal to 1 so we've seen this

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.660 
than or equal to 1 so we've seen this
result<00:00:24.600> that<00:00:24.890> polynomial<00:00:25.890> functions<00:00:26.460> are

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
result that polynomial functions are

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.120 
result that polynomial functions are
continuous<00:00:27.060> on<00:00:27.449> their<00:00:27.599> domain<00:00:27.710> x<00:00:28.710> squared

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
continuous on their domain x squared

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.269 
continuous on their domain x squared
plus<00:00:29.369> 3<00:00:29.730> is<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:29.880> polynomial<00:00:30.679> whatever<00:00:31.679> value<00:00:32.130> we

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
plus 3 is a polynomial whatever value we

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.729 
plus 3 is a polynomial whatever value we
pick<00:00:32.520> for<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:32.969> when<00:00:33.660> we<00:00:33.750> multiply<00:00:34.200> that<00:00:34.380> by<00:00:34.440> X

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
pick for a when we multiply that by X

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.860 
pick for a when we multiply that by X
plus<00:00:35.130> 6<00:00:35.430> that's<00:00:35.730> going<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:35.969> be<00:00:36.090> continuous<00:00:36.719> as

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
plus 6 that's going to be continuous as

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.530 
plus 6 that's going to be continuous as
well<00:00:37.140> so<00:00:38.070> definitely<00:00:38.520> it's<00:00:38.790> continuous<00:00:39.360> for

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
well so definitely it's continuous for

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.090 
well so definitely it's continuous for
everything<00:00:39.840> less<00:00:40.050> than<00:00:40.079> 1<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:40.530> everything

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
everything less than 1 and everything

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.670 
everything less than 1 and everything
greater<00:00:41.399> than<00:00:41.640> 1<00:00:41.879> again<00:00:42.629> where<00:00:43.290> they<00:00:43.410> kind<00:00:43.620> of

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
greater than 1 again where they kind of

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.979 
greater than 1 again where they kind of
break<00:00:43.920> at<00:00:44.219> this<00:00:44.430> x<00:00:44.670> coordinate<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:45.210> 1<00:00:45.450> they<00:00:45.809> may

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
break at this x coordinate of 1 they may

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.139 
break at this x coordinate of 1 they may
or<00:00:46.140> may<00:00:46.289> not<00:00:46.320> be<00:00:46.680> continuous<00:00:47.280> depending<00:00:48.059> on

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
or may not be continuous depending on

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.150 
or may not be continuous depending on
the<00:00:48.239> value<00:00:48.570> of<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.930> but<00:00:49.590> we're<00:00:49.739> trying<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:50.039> again

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
the value of a but we're trying to again

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.770 
the value of a but we're trying to again
pick<00:00:50.460> that<00:00:50.610> value<00:00:51.030> of<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.210> so<00:00:51.270> that<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.600> does

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
pick that value of a so that it does

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.869 
pick that value of a so that it does
happen<00:00:52.199> so<00:00:53.129> again<00:00:53.340> we're<00:00:53.460> going<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.670> use<00:00:53.760> our

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
happen so again we're going to use our

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.660 
happen so again we're going to use our
definition<00:00:54.120> what<00:00:54.809> we<00:00:54.930> want<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.710> occur<00:00:56.010> is<00:00:56.309> we

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
definition what we want to occur is we

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.569 
definition what we want to occur is we
want<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.940> limit<00:00:57.149> as<00:00:57.420> X<00:00:57.719> approaches<00:00:58.230> 1<00:00:58.559> of<00:00:58.829> the

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
want the limit as X approaches 1 of the

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.560 
want the limit as X approaches 1 of the
function<00:01:00.680> we<00:01:01.680> want<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:02.070> to<00:01:02.190> equal<00:01:02.609> F<00:01:02.820> of<00:01:03.300> 1

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
function we want that to equal F of 1

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.399 
function we want that to equal F of 1
okay<00:01:04.350> well<00:01:05.129> for<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.880> limit<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.330> exist<00:01:06.450> the

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
okay well for the limit to exist the

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.700 
okay well for the limit to exist the
limit<00:01:07.770> as<00:01:07.890> X<00:01:08.220> approaches<00:01:08.820> 1<00:01:09.240> from<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.570> left

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
limit as X approaches 1 from the left

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.920 
limit as X approaches 1 from the left
that's<00:01:10.710> going<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:10.979> have<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.189> equal<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:12.689> limit

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
that's going to have to equal the limit

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.130 
that's going to have to equal the limit
as<00:01:13.320> X<00:01:14.130> approaches<00:01:14.700> 1<00:01:15.000> from<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.390> right<00:01:15.420> so<00:01:16.049> my

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
as X approaches 1 from the right so my

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.340 
as X approaches 1 from the right so my
little<00:01:16.409> sideways<00:01:17.040> equal<00:01:17.490> sign<00:01:17.700> there<00:01:18.170> well<00:01:19.170> if

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
little sideways equal sign there well if

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.380 
little sideways equal sign there well if
X<00:01:19.650> is<00:01:19.799> approaching<00:01:20.280> 1<00:01:20.490> from<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.820> left<00:01:20.850> we're

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
X is approaching 1 from the left we're

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.830 
X is approaching 1 from the left we're
using<00:01:21.659> values<00:01:22.049> of<00:01:22.200> X<00:01:22.380> smaller<00:01:23.280> than<00:01:23.610> 1<00:01:23.850> so<00:01:24.689> we

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
using values of X smaller than 1 so we

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.960 
using values of X smaller than 1 so we
would<00:01:25.020> be<00:01:25.140> using<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.530> function<00:01:26.070> x<00:01:26.700> squared

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
would be using the function x squared

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.109 
would be using the function x squared
plus<00:01:27.840> 3<00:01:28.380> when<00:01:29.220> we<00:01:29.340> do<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.579> limit<00:01:29.759> as<00:01:29.939> X

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
plus 3 when we do the limit as X

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.940 
plus 3 when we do the limit as X
approaches<00:01:30.570> 1<00:01:30.780> from<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.990> right<00:01:31.079> well<00:01:31.710> now

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
approaches 1 from the right well now

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.310 
approaches 1 from the right well now
we're<00:01:32.100> taking<00:01:32.250> x-coordinates<00:01:33.060> larger<00:01:33.750> than<00:01:34.020> 1

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
we're taking x-coordinates larger than 1

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.399 
we're taking x-coordinates larger than 1
so<00:01:35.009> we<00:01:35.130> would<00:01:35.280> use<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.610> function<00:01:36.030> ax<00:01:36.509> plus<00:01:37.200> 6

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
so we would use the function ax plus 6

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.080 
so we would use the function ax plus 6
well<00:01:40.409> for<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.829> first<00:01:41.040> one<00:01:41.250> if<00:01:41.369> we<00:01:41.460> plug<00:01:41.490> in<00:01:41.850> x

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
well for the first one if we plug in x

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.249 
well for the first one if we plug in x
equals<00:01:42.270> 1<00:01:42.780> we'll<00:01:43.079> get<00:01:43.229> 1<00:01:43.530> squared<00:01:44.180> plus<00:01:45.180> 3<00:01:45.720> or

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
equals 1 we'll get 1 squared plus 3 or

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.030 
equals 1 we'll get 1 squared plus 3 or
we'll<00:01:46.560> get<00:01:46.680> the<00:01:46.799> value<00:01:47.189> 4<00:01:48.200> if<00:01:49.200> we<00:01:49.380> plug<00:01:49.619> 1<00:01:49.860> into

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
we'll get the value 4 if we plug 1 into

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.010 
we'll get the value 4 if we plug 1 into
the<00:01:50.220> second<00:01:50.640> expression<00:01:51.030> again<00:01:51.869> we're

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
the second expression again we're

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.190 
the second expression again we're
plugging<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:52.439> in<00:01:52.560> for<00:01:52.740> X<00:01:52.979> we'll<00:01:53.909> get<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.210> times<00:01:54.750> 1

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
plugging it in for X we'll get a times 1

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.630 
plugging it in for X we'll get a times 1
plus<00:01:56.189> 6<00:01:56.579> or<00:01:57.450> we'll<00:01:57.719> just<00:01:57.750> be<00:01:57.960> left<00:01:58.140> with<00:01:58.259> a<00:01:58.640> plus

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
plus 6 or we'll just be left with a plus

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.109 
plus 6 or we'll just be left with a plus
6<00:02:00.170> but<00:02:01.170> again<00:02:01.380> for<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.649> limit<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.130> exist<00:02:02.640> the

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
6 but again for the limit to exist the

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.700 
6 but again for the limit to exist the
left-hand<00:02:03.570> limit<00:02:03.750> has<00:02:04.110> to<00:02:04.140> equal<00:02:04.439> the

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
left-hand limit has to equal the

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.010 
left-hand limit has to equal the
right-hand<00:02:04.920> limit<00:02:05.340> so<00:02:06.210> that<00:02:06.240> would<00:02:06.570> tell<00:02:06.780> us

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
right-hand limit so that would tell us

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.529 
right-hand limit so that would tell us
that<00:02:07.259> that<00:02:07.740> means<00:02:08.129> that<00:02:08.399> 4<00:02:08.849> would<00:02:09.209> have<00:02:09.390> to

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
that that means that 4 would have to

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.540 
that that means that 4 would have to
equal<00:02:09.720> well<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.819> plus

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
equal well a plus

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.940 
equal well a plus
and<00:02:13.450> while<00:02:13.780> we<00:02:13.930> can<00:02:14.050> just<00:02:14.200> subtract<00:02:14.560> 6<00:02:14.860> from

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
and while we can just subtract 6 from

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.530 
and while we can just subtract 6 from
both<00:02:15.100> sides<00:02:15.250> and<00:02:15.910> that<00:02:16.120> would<00:02:16.240> give<00:02:16.420> us

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
both sides and that would give us

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.880 
both sides and that would give us
negative<00:02:16.720> 2<00:02:17.380> as<00:02:17.680> our<00:02:17.980> value<00:02:18.820> for<00:02:19.120> a<00:02:19.680> so<00:02:20.680> in<00:02:20.800> this

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
negative 2 as our value for a so in this

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.450 
negative 2 as our value for a so in this
case<00:02:21.130> we've<00:02:21.370> made<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:21.760> limit<00:02:22.800> equal<00:02:23.800> okay

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
case we've made the limit equal okay

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:25.950 
case we've made the limit equal okay
because<00:02:24.580> if<00:02:24.760> we<00:02:24.850> use<00:02:24.880> the<00:02:25.240> a<00:02:25.270> value<00:02:25.840> of

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
because if we use the a value of

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.500 
because if we use the a value of
negative<00:02:26.110> to<00:02:26.710> the<00:02:27.340> left<00:02:27.580> hand<00:02:27.730> limit<00:02:27.970> and<00:02:28.150> the

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
negative to the left hand limit and the

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.130 
negative to the left hand limit and the
right<00:02:28.540> hand<00:02:28.960> limit<00:02:29.290> will<00:02:29.470> both<00:02:29.620> equal<00:02:30.010> 4<00:02:30.430> and

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
right hand limit will both equal 4 and

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.100 
right hand limit will both equal 4 and
so<00:02:32.140> the<00:02:32.260> limit<00:02:32.560> exists<00:02:33.160> and<00:02:33.750> notice<00:02:34.750> you<00:02:34.990> know

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
so the limit exists and notice you know

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.200 
so the limit exists and notice you know
now<00:02:35.290> if<00:02:35.470> you<00:02:35.590> plug<00:02:35.830> in<00:02:35.860> the<00:02:36.370> x<00:02:36.580> coordinate<00:02:37.090> of<00:02:37.150> 1

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
now if you plug in the x coordinate of 1

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.330 
now if you plug in the x coordinate of 1
again<00:02:37.930> we've<00:02:38.170> now<00:02:38.290> figured<00:02:38.530> out<00:02:38.800> that<00:02:39.040> this<00:02:39.190> is

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
again we've now figured out that this is

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.010 
again we've now figured out that this is
the<00:02:39.370> function<00:02:39.910> we<00:02:40.090> should<00:02:40.120> be<00:02:40.360> using<00:02:40.540> negative

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
the function we should be using negative

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.310 
the function we should be using negative
2x<00:02:41.380> plus<00:02:41.830> 6<00:02:42.420> notice<00:02:43.420> if<00:02:43.540> you<00:02:43.630> plug<00:02:43.870> one<00:02:44.140> into

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
2x plus 6 notice if you plug one into

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.020 
2x plus 6 notice if you plug one into
that<00:02:44.590> again<00:02:44.920> we'll<00:02:45.100> just<00:02:45.130> get<00:02:45.400> negative<00:02:45.610> 2

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
that again we'll just get negative 2

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.410 
that again we'll just get negative 2
plus<00:02:46.840> 6<00:02:47.550> which<00:02:48.550> again<00:02:48.760> will<00:02:48.970> give<00:02:49.120> us<00:02:49.240> the

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
plus 6 which again will give us the

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.200 
plus 6 which again will give us the
value<00:02:49.540> for<00:02:50.110> that<00:02:50.320> we<00:02:50.470> want<00:02:50.680> so<00:02:51.130> it<00:02:51.490> says<00:02:52.000> if<00:02:52.180> we

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.210 
value for that we want so it says if we

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.750 
value for that we want so it says if we
make<00:02:52.510> a<00:02:52.690> equal<00:02:53.260> to<00:02:53.290> negative<00:02:53.530> 2<00:02:53.950> the<00:02:54.370> limits

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
make a equal to negative 2 the limits

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.110 
make a equal to negative 2 the limits
will<00:02:54.940> exist<00:02:55.590> and<00:02:56.590> in<00:02:57.040> a<00:02:57.220> sense<00:02:57.370> by<00:02:57.550> default<00:02:57.910> for

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
will exist and in a sense by default for

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.690 
will exist and in a sense by default for
this<00:02:58.270> particular<00:02:58.750> function<00:02:58.960> it'll<00:02:59.770> also<00:02:59.950> give

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
this particular function it'll also give

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.940 
this particular function it'll also give
you<00:03:00.820> the<00:03:00.940> correct<00:03:01.210> value<00:03:01.780> so<00:03:02.050> really<00:03:02.710> kind<00:03:02.890> of

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
you the correct value so really kind of

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.610 
you the correct value so really kind of
the<00:03:03.070> you<00:03:03.700> know<00:03:03.820> I<00:03:03.850> think<00:03:04.150> in<00:03:04.510> a<00:03:04.870> sense<00:03:05.020> to<00:03:05.260> do

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
the you know I think in a sense to do

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.380 
the you know I think in a sense to do
the<00:03:05.770> problem<00:03:06.250> you<00:03:06.640> just<00:03:06.670> need<00:03:07.000> to<00:03:07.090> set<00:03:07.300> the

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
the problem you just need to set the

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.060 
the problem you just need to set the
left<00:03:07.600> hand<00:03:07.810> limit<00:03:07.930> equal<00:03:08.440> to<00:03:08.560> the<00:03:08.680> right<00:03:08.860> hand

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
left hand limit equal to the right hand

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.780 
left hand limit equal to the right hand
limit<00:03:09.460> and<00:03:09.660> solve<00:03:10.660> it
