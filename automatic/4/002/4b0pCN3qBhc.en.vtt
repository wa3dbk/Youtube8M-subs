00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.379
 hello that as they are today is my turn 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.460
 to cook and I have a delicious 

00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:11.500
 dish this delicious dish is about 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:13.210
 beef with white rice 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.320
 and here I have the ingredients that I'm going 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:19.000
 to present we are going to need 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.510
 a head of garlic show me how well by 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.750
 please to show that so well 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:29.490
 I forget that it is still ground and with a little 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.490
 and solution to the meat to meet the 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.910
 and a little hot pepper 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.470
 but that's optional because it's not all 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.210
 the world that likes spicy chilli 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.370
 it depends on you 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.489
 also cilantro 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:47.210
 a little cilantro half a 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:49.699
 onion half of a green chili pepper and a 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.050
 bit wide and here I have a lot to 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:55.480
 so you can take half depends 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:57.440
 of you and oregano 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.170
 sopita as the audience say 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.710
 Dominican but good most of the 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:06.650
 people say chicken cubes 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.799
 and olive oil or olive language 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.799
 but 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:15.400
 there is a very important thing the meat of 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.430
 cow for what because I do not know about you 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:21.430
 but I do not like it I do not like it very much 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:24.270
 because it's a bit dry and when the 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.280
 kitchen and it 's one hard 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.750
 there is a trick that is that you 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.050
 finite strings look 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.240
 the rope the finite flesh 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:37.310
 and so the meat is going to cook fast and 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.950
 will be there will not be any 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.750
 a first stage they will take a footprint 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.399
 They have echo a little olive oil 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.770
 because we want the meat that cold 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:48.610
 that olive oil is very healthy 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.610
 for that 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:02:01.570
 is the one that covers all the pot 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:04.180
 look like that if it's more or less like two 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.490
 large spoons during this 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.820
 hot enough then let's open 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.820
 face 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:24.120
 inventors 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.849
 I love it seems to be fascinates me 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.799
 when you additional cold meat let's go 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:32.060
 give a little water and you have to let 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:32.060
 dry so they cool down a lot 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.210
 And the water 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.670
 if you are watching the series 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:41.220
 we will be 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:45.960
 how long the beautiful star 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:47.160
 if only a little bit just a 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.320
 bit 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.250
 from a little water look and the 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.250
 amount of water is 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.960
 the amount of water only is that 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:01.840
 cover the lime 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.840
 it is not necessary to throw more 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:08.860
 I turn dry and we will put another 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.860
 so that the meat is well tender 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.280
 in this delicious flight 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:19.740
 how much water does 2 have? 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.440
 I already throw the second water and now what 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:24.569
 let's put the reasons come as 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.830
 I have enough as I said before I have 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.760
 quite so then he has done half 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:31.629
 of this decade the thing 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.140
 the wise look of the onion and the 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:35.579
 left 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.579
 look, attend enough 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:43.750
 and we are also going to put the cube of 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:49.110
 chicken milk I'm like a little bit more 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:51.240
 of half were trying to see if 7 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.720
 how do you like them enough 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.720
 salty 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:57.570
 or if they want more 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.490
 when the second voice is drying 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:02.260
 let's throw him 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.440
 the recadito that we cut for this 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.440
 moment 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:14.770
 Y 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.770
 and the one that we put aside 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.750
 this is delicious is this 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:35.960
 and how is it condominated that all 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:38.450
 words have to use is happy 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:43.910
 like at home 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:43.910
 Yes it is 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.960
 betis and others 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:55.910
 bridge 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:57.350
 Look, they put the garlic in front of the end 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.660
 when the water store is drying 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:03.520
 because that's the taste of garlic to be 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:03.520
 more pronounced the face 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:10.230
 ok we let it dry the normal water 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:11.760
 and when it dries then offering them 

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.880
 so that the meat is well fried and that 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.770
 light 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.980
 and as I tell them they can try a little 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:19.630
 see if they lack more salt or it does not come out but 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:22.500
 Sometimes it takes more and anyone 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:22.500
 what do you like more 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:31.960
 so we let the water dry 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:34.479
 at high heat but not maximum that although 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.930
 and the citrus water and now we're going to 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:36.930
 leave cold 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:45.669
 As required, they leave it there 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.289
 a few five minutes and but no 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:50.129
 lose sight because this one can 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:50.129
 burn is clear 

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:56.539
 here they have the result a meat of 

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:56.539
 delicious cow with white rice 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:06.610
 and very easy to prepare me too 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:10.290
 this was the same and I'm sure that 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:10.290
 we are also going to try 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.660
 already 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:32.100
 very rich 

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:35.479
 also decision 

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:39.289
 I tell myself man if I'm going to eat 

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:43.810
