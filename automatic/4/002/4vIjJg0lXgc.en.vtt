well<00:00:03.570> here's<00:00:03.750> the<00:00:03.870> new<00:00:04.080> 2014<00:00:04.859> Renault<00:00:05.250> Formula

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
well here's the new 2014 Renault Formula

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.570 
well here's the new 2014 Renault Formula
one<00:00:05.700> engine<00:00:06.649> yeah<00:00:07.649> what<00:00:07.950> you<00:00:08.040> can<00:00:08.220> see

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
one engine yeah what you can see

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.190 
one engine yeah what you can see
rotating<00:00:08.910> around<00:00:09.450> here<00:00:09.690> is<00:00:09.900> obviously

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
rotating around here is obviously

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.020 
rotating around here is obviously
they've<00:00:10.349> made<00:00:10.650> the<00:00:10.950> exhaust<00:00:11.309> and<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:11.670> inlets

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
they've made the exhaust and the inlets

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.490 
they've made the exhaust and the inlets
and<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.300> turbocharger<00:00:12.900> all<00:00:13.019> invisible<00:00:13.230> so

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
and the turbocharger all invisible so

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.749 
and the turbocharger all invisible so
you<00:00:13.530> can<00:00:13.710> actually<00:00:13.799> see<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.160> core<00:00:14.429> of<00:00:14.670> the

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
you can actually see the core of the

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.960 
you can actually see the core of the
engine<00:00:15.199> which<00:00:16.199> for<00:00:16.500> this<00:00:16.740> year<00:00:16.949> is<00:00:17.130> a<00:00:17.160> 1.6

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
engine which for this year is a 1.6

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.359 
engine which for this year is a 1.6
liter<00:00:18.150> v6<00:00:18.660> engine<00:00:18.810> not<00:00:19.740> that<00:00:19.920> dissimilar<00:00:20.070> to

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
liter v6 engine not that dissimilar to

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.460 
liter v6 engine not that dissimilar to
for<00:00:20.609> real<00:00:20.699> officer<00:00:21.090> on<00:00:21.270> our<00:00:21.420> road<00:00:22.050> cars<00:00:22.320> in

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
for real officer on our road cars in

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.790 
for real officer on our road cars in
terms<00:00:22.710> of<00:00:22.830> size<00:00:23.100> and<00:00:23.340> shape<00:00:23.580> of<00:00:23.699> engine<00:00:24.800> lots

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.529 
terms of size and shape of engine lots
of<00:00:25.920> differences<00:00:26.340> obviously<00:00:26.550> this<00:00:26.970> engine

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
of differences obviously this engine

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.109 
of differences obviously this engine
will<00:00:27.630> run<00:00:27.720> up<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:28.019> 15,000<00:00:28.890> rpm<00:00:29.279> it's<00:00:29.580> running

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
will run up to 15,000 rpm it's running

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.540 
will run up to 15,000 rpm it's running
direct<00:00:30.570> injection<00:00:31.170> to<00:00:31.650> help<00:00:31.830> improve<00:00:32.219> the

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
direct injection to help improve the

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.780 
direct injection to help improve the
fuel<00:00:33.180> economy<00:00:33.390> of<00:00:33.750> the<00:00:33.870> engine<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.520> as<00:00:35.520> we<00:00:35.700> can

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
fuel economy of the engine and as we can

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.850 
fuel economy of the engine and as we can
see<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.180> engine<00:00:36.630> rotating<00:00:37.350> around<00:00:37.440> there<00:00:37.739> we

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
see the engine rotating around there we

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.860 
see the engine rotating around there we
can<00:00:38.010> see<00:00:38.190> that<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.610> exhaust<00:00:39.300> coming<00:00:39.600> out<00:00:39.719> the

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
can see that the exhaust coming out the

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.450 
can see that the exhaust coming out the
sides<00:00:40.079> of<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.350> engine<00:00:40.680> are<00:00:40.829> feeding<00:00:41.250> back

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
sides of the engine are feeding back

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.930 
sides of the engine are feeding back
into<00:00:42.110> a<00:00:43.110> turbocharger<00:00:44.040> which<00:00:44.190> typically<00:00:44.820> is

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
into a turbocharger which typically is

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.150 
into a turbocharger which typically is
mounted<00:00:45.239> at<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.360> back<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.870> engine<00:00:46.160> and

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
mounted at the back of the engine and

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.040 
mounted at the back of the engine and
then<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.730> exhaust<00:00:47.940> tailpipe<00:00:48.510> coming<00:00:48.840> out<00:00:48.930> the

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
then the exhaust tailpipe coming out the

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.139 
then the exhaust tailpipe coming out the
back<00:00:49.200> there<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:50.100> other<00:00:50.700> element<00:00:51.030> of<00:00:51.059> the

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
back there the other element of the

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.990 
back there the other element of the
turbocharger<00:00:51.510> will<00:00:52.110> feed<00:00:52.320> into<00:00:52.680> a

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
turbocharger will feed into a

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.880 
turbocharger will feed into a
intercooler<00:00:54.000> which<00:00:54.120> we<00:00:54.239> can't<00:00:54.780> see<00:00:55.020> here<00:00:55.289> but

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
intercooler which we can't see here but

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.470 
intercooler which we can't see here but
then<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.129> air<00:00:56.280> goes<00:00:56.309> into<00:00:56.789> this<00:00:56.850> big<00:00:57.059> plenum

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
then the air goes into this big plenum

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.029 
then the air goes into this big plenum
chamber<00:00:57.510> at<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:57.989> top<00:00:58.199> of<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.469> engine<00:00:58.620> and

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
chamber at the top of the engine and

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.010 
chamber at the top of the engine and
then<00:00:59.370> feeds<00:00:59.640> compressed<00:01:00.090> air<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.449> fuel<00:01:00.629> down

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
then feeds compressed air and fuel down

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.280 
then feeds compressed air and fuel down
inside<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.160> engine<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:03.149> as<00:01:03.239> I<00:01:03.300> say<00:01:03.480> this<00:01:04.019> year

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
inside the engine and as I say this year

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.530 
inside the engine and as I say this year
fuel<00:01:05.100> flow<00:01:05.339> is<00:01:05.489> restricted<00:01:05.820> so<00:01:06.180> you<00:01:06.299> can<00:01:06.420> only

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
fuel flow is restricted so you can only

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.200 
fuel flow is restricted so you can only
run<00:01:07.189> during<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.340> race<00:01:08.520> two-thirds<00:01:09.030> of<00:01:09.119> the

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
run during the race two-thirds of the

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.399 
run during the race two-thirds of the
fuel<00:01:09.420> that<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.600> were<00:01:09.720> typically<00:01:10.140> have<00:01:10.229> used

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
fuel that you were typically have used

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.899 
fuel that you were typically have used
in<00:01:10.560> previous<00:01:10.890> years<00:01:10.979> just<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.280> hundred<00:01:11.460> kilos

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
in previous years just a hundred kilos

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.730 
in previous years just a hundred kilos
for<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.180> whole<00:01:12.330> race<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.439> actual

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
for the whole race and the actual

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.920 
for the whole race and the actual
maximum<00:01:14.130> fuel<00:01:14.670> flow<00:01:14.909> rate<00:01:15.150> at<00:01:15.330> any<00:01:15.420> one<00:01:15.689> point

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
maximum fuel flow rate at any one point

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.960 
maximum fuel flow rate at any one point
is<00:01:16.170> limited<00:01:16.590> as<00:01:16.710> well<00:01:16.740> these<00:01:17.460> engines<00:01:17.880> are

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
is limited as well these engines are

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.440 
is limited as well these engines are
going<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.180> be<00:01:18.299> running<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:18.900> know<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:20.210> 30%<00:01:21.210> less

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
going to be running you know to 30% less

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.570 
going to be running you know to 30% less
more<00:01:21.900> efficient<00:01:22.320> than<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.770> current<00:01:23.220> engines

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
more efficient than the current engines

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.460 
more efficient than the current engines
and<00:01:23.790> big<00:01:24.360> chunk<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:24.659> this<00:01:24.780> is<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.140> do<00:01:25.259> with<00:01:25.290> the

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
and big chunk of this is to do with the

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.929 
and big chunk of this is to do with the
turbo<00:01:25.799> charging<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.670> do<00:01:26.729> with<00:01:26.880> this

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
turbo charging and to do with this

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.330 
turbo charging and to do with this
direct<00:01:27.299> injection<00:01:27.810> as<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:28.049> can<00:01:28.200> see<00:01:28.409> sticking

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
direct injection as you can see sticking

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.530 
direct injection as you can see sticking
out<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.579> top<00:01:29.640> of<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.909> cylinder<00:01:30.150> it's<00:01:30.360> heads

out the top of the cylinder it's heads

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.390 
out the top of the cylinder it's heads
there<00:01:30.810> just<00:01:31.049> above<00:01:31.259> where<00:01:31.560> it<00:01:31.650> says<00:01:31.680> energy<00:01:32.250> on

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
there just above where it says energy on

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
the on the cam covers these cylindrical

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.620 
the on the cam covers these cylindrical
elements<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.579> these<00:01:35.640> are<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.939> fuel<00:01:36.270> pumps

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
elements and these are the fuel pumps

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.390 
elements and these are the fuel pumps
and<00:01:36.780> these<00:01:36.869> will<00:01:37.020> pump<00:01:37.290> in<00:01:37.439> fuel<00:01:37.740> directly

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
and these will pump in fuel directly

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.270 
and these will pump in fuel directly
into<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.150> cylinder<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.110> engine<00:01:40.170> at<00:01:40.560> 500

they're then going up to the turbine
stage<00:03:23.060> of<00:03:23.300> the<00:03:23.420> turbocharger<00:03:23.780> that<00:03:24.709> spins

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
stage of the turbocharger that spins

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.580 
stage of the turbocharger that spins
this<00:03:25.370> fan<00:03:25.700> and<00:03:26.030> then<00:03:26.690> the<00:03:26.840> exhaust<00:03:27.140> just<00:03:27.320> comes

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
this fan and then the exhaust just comes

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.040 
this fan and then the exhaust just comes
out<00:03:27.740> the<00:03:27.830> tailpipe<00:03:28.330> with<00:03:29.330> lots<00:03:29.570> of<00:03:29.690> its<00:03:29.840> energy

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
out the tailpipe with lots of its energy

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.360 
out the tailpipe with lots of its energy
taken<00:03:30.709> up<00:03:31.090> from<00:03:32.090> the<00:03:32.270> turbocharger<00:03:33.110> the<00:03:34.040> shaft

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
taken up from the turbocharger the shaft

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.400 
taken up from the turbocharger the shaft
that's<00:03:34.610> attached<00:03:35.000> to<00:03:35.120> that<00:03:35.260> turbocharger<00:03:36.260> fan

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
that's attached to that turbocharger fan

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:37.870 
that's attached to that turbocharger fan
then<00:03:36.590> goes<00:03:36.709> into<00:03:36.890> the<00:03:37.010> compressor<00:03:37.340> fan<00:03:37.700> which

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
then goes into the compressor fan which

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.120 
then goes into the compressor fan which
we<00:03:38.000> can<00:03:38.120> see<00:03:38.300> here<00:03:38.570> in<00:03:38.690> purple<00:03:39.020> and<00:03:39.680> what<00:03:40.040> this

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
we can see here in purple and what this

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:41.890 
we can see here in purple and what this
is<00:03:40.280> doing<00:03:40.459> is<00:03:40.640> is<00:03:40.730> sucking<00:03:41.090> that<00:03:41.209> fresh<00:03:41.480> air<00:03:41.720> in

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
is doing is is sucking that fresh air in

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.500 
is doing is is sucking that fresh air in
from<00:03:42.230> the<00:03:42.260> Roll<00:03:42.950> hoop<00:03:43.160> and<00:03:43.370> compressing<00:03:44.360> it

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
from the Roll hoop and compressing it

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.449 
from the Roll hoop and compressing it
and<00:03:44.650> this<00:03:45.650> means<00:03:45.860> that<00:03:45.920> you<00:03:46.070> can<00:03:46.160> actually<00:03:46.250> get

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
and this means that you can actually get

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.729 
and this means that you can actually get
more<00:03:46.520> air<00:03:47.030> into<00:03:47.390> the<00:03:47.720> engine<00:03:47.840> which<00:03:48.440> means<00:03:48.650> you

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
more air into the engine which means you

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:49.900 
more air into the engine which means you
can<00:03:48.860> then<00:03:48.950> have<00:03:49.070> more<00:03:49.250> fuel<00:03:49.430> which<00:03:49.610> gives<00:03:49.820> you

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
can then have more fuel which gives you

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:50.680 
can then have more fuel which gives you
more<00:03:49.940> power

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
more power

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.660 
more power
the<00:03:51.170> problem<00:03:51.500> with<00:03:51.650> compressing<00:03:52.310> the<00:03:52.430> air<00:03:52.550> is

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
the problem with compressing the air is

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.670 
the problem with compressing the air is
it<00:03:52.790> makes<00:03:52.970> the<00:03:53.120> air<00:03:53.239> very<00:03:53.420> hot<00:03:53.750> so<00:03:54.470> what

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
it makes the air very hot so what

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.110 
it makes the air very hot so what
happens<00:03:55.100> then<00:03:55.310> first<00:03:55.610> of<00:03:55.670> all<00:03:55.730> you<00:03:55.820> can<00:03:55.940> see

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
happens then first of all you can see

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.150 
happens then first of all you can see
the<00:03:56.300> purple<00:03:56.840> air<00:03:57.080> being<00:03:57.290> inducted<00:03:57.560> away<00:03:57.980> to<00:03:58.040> a

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
throttle at corner exit but what's

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:48.820 
throttle at corner exit but what's
happened<00:04:47.480> is<00:04:47.570> the<00:04:47.660> turbocharger<00:04:48.410> is<00:04:48.530> slowed

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
happened is the turbocharger is slowed

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.040 
happened is the turbocharger is slowed
down<00:04:48.860> now<00:04:49.640> on<00:04:49.760> a<00:04:49.790> conventional<00:04:50.240> turbocharger

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
down now on a conventional turbocharger

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.750 
down now on a conventional turbocharger
that<00:04:51.290> would<00:04:51.410> give<00:04:51.590> you<00:04:51.710> turbo<00:04:52.130> lag<00:04:52.370> so<00:04:52.520> you<00:04:52.610> put

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:52.760 
that would give you turbo lag so you put

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.400 
that would give you turbo lag so you put
your<00:04:52.790> foot<00:04:53.090> down<00:04:53.210> on<00:04:53.420> the<00:04:53.510> throttle<00:04:53.660> but

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
your foot down on the throttle but

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:55.810 
your foot down on the throttle but
you've<00:04:54.530> got<00:04:54.620> to<00:04:54.710> wait<00:04:54.860> for<00:04:54.890> the<00:04:55.130> turbocharger

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
you've got to wait for the turbocharger

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.910 
you've got to wait for the turbocharger
to<00:04:56.000> spark<00:04:56.300> start<00:04:56.690> spinning<00:04:56.990> up<00:04:57.260> in<00:04:57.590> order<00:04:57.800> to

through<00:06:02.000> a<00:06:02.060> corner<00:06:03.280> so<00:06:04.280> now<00:06:04.400> we<00:06:04.460> move<00:06:04.700> on<00:06:04.940> to

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:04.970
