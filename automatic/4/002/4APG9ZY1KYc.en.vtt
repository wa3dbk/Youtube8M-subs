00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 welcome to talent yesterday today as united 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.790
 we talk about news from the video world 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.720
 making and now also competitions and awards 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.720
 and initials 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.050
 as I said in the proceeds we talk 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.960
 also of competitions because the news 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:19.880
 however, they also include competitions 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.619
 let's start immediately with the most beautiful one 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.090
 recently launched as a competition 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.940
 of the barilla that it makes available 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.010
 a prize pool of 10,000 euros 3,000 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.020
 euro to the first classified 2000 second 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.330
 ranked and from third to tenth 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.559
 position 500 euros 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.360
 so I realize that maybe 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:38.239
 the maximum aspiration of a video maker 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.050
 you don't know how to make a video about a sauce 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:40.910
 amatriciana 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.790
 however, I believe they are initiatives 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.020
 very good and nice to see anyway 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.579
 big companies that launches into these 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.219
 competitions is not the first time of course 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:51.230
 but to see that continue ago 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:53.090
 so please all videomakers 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.370
 put pride aside as you would say 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:59.600
 marcellus wallace launch into these 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:01.340
 things because one up to 10 to the first ten 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.200
 seats could wait up to 500 euros 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.509
 which is not little 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.789
 2 if you succeed the 32 first ten anyway 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:09.890
 you have at the portfolio level 

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:11.899
 worked however collaborated in some 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.179
 way with the barilla that is not little 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:15.979
 try all the briefs in the descriptions 

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:18.440
 of this contest in the description 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.240
 how to participate what you need lines 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.369
 guides the technical specifications of the video 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.099
 it 's nothing too weird 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:26.869
 you can make stop motion animation 

00:01:25.099 --> 00:01:30.709
 short films must be 30 seconds 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:34.340
 then I suggest you check it out 

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:36.200
 to try these things are you children 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.300
 have you ever participated in competitions designed 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.950
 to do it let me know and if anyone 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.660
 of you should participate after having 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.700
 saw my video and win anyway 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.920
 from the top ten I want to know is I want 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.200
 type nor thank you written on his 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.800
 the darling leaps one spear new two 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:55.099
 objectives stabilized on 24 70 mm f 4 e 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:58.009
 35 mm f 2 then obviously then 

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:59.989
 this 70 f4 is not properly worn 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.479
 to make them smf 4 videos maybe ne 

00:01:59.989 --> 00:02:05.330
 outside do something good inside 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:08.300
 no, however, the 35 mm f 2 is definitely 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.099
 an excellent excellent solution for those 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.270
 wanted a wide-angle stabilized 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:13.099
 now we have already talked about 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.290
 stabilization of the objectives in the video 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:16.250
 previous is an element that at least in the 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.100
 video is 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.860
 really fundamental not fundamental 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.840
 but it is however the difference is really 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.110
 obvious we know that money where I am 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:30.710
 finished I have my experience with 100 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.850
 mm stabilized is really fantastic 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.730
 if I try to put and remove the 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:37.070
 stabilization seems to go from one 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:40.520
 with hands moving so to 1 with 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.690
 hands so that metaphor is good to see 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.630
 that the canon invests in objectives 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:47.090
 stabilized especially for what 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.440
 it's about the video because a 35mm can 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.500
 be used for photojournalists but it is 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.180
 however also great wide angle 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.520
 obviously it is mounted on both its psc and 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.130
 I see full frame very well 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.380
 up and the full frames so know that it is 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:03.230
 left it costs a little bit or not me 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.580
 remember framework impare 400 however is beautiful 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.080
 see that the canon goes on i 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.550
 stabilized you have goals 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.520
 stabilize let me know 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.530
 so we spend years with the yes I said 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:15.230
 nikon you know that I only talk about canon 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.570
 but for a reason that the reason why 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.390
 now explains talking about nikon the unical 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:23.959
 launches the new 5.200 that made me 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:28.070
 sharpen your ears for the fact that 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:31.100
 it runs in full hd at 60 fps and above 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:33.830
 the fact that on the removable screen 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:36.440
 as the 600 round at 650 of this has me 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:40.489
 made to say beautiful the nikon is launched 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:42.709
 also in reflex designed also for the 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:44.959
 video will therefore have control models 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:46.880
 video manual and I'm wrong here 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.860
 because apparently the nikon still 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.260
 this thing did not resolve it introduced 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.959
 so you will have your reflex reflex 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.690
 nice to be able to set the values ​​first 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:58.010
 but you can't during the 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.500
 registration change values ​​of 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.630
 openness and so on 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.920
 why eni with why you do this the 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:06.530
 which is why I speak mainly 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.090
 of canon beyond the fact that ocalan the 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.640
 fact that the nikon apparently seems 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.700
 want to put on the pedestal of the 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:15.860
 photograph take little steps towards the 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.390
 video but without throwing too much and is a 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.570
 a bit strange considering the fact that 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:22.250
 videoreflex in the last period are 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.770
 each brand between the sony the red that a 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.890
 low prices and the canon are aiming 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.440
 on the video sector nikon seems 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:30.660
 sbattersene 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.610
 don't want to get too far off then 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.740
 until I do not think so 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.690
 I will speak particularly of bodies 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.670
 nikon machine regarding the 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.500
 goals in other speech you have 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:41.510
 nikon machine bodies parazzini of 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.940
 your experiences 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:46.950
 I want a challenge in the comments between the 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.200
 fanboy canon and nikon I really want the 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.770
 fight without there just launch yourself
