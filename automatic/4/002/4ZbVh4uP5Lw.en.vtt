00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.320
 hello dear friends with you 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.780
 online magazine civil radio 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:17.550
 radio chif. room and this video revision 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:19.289
 radio stations megajet mj-555 radio stations 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.420
 these quite recently appeared on 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.789
 the market after a three-month break 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.859
 them again, you can buy which to station 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.289
 ordered pavel from the city of cheboksary 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:31.080
 later the radio station just got out 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.850
 the boxes hooked it works nothing 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.899
 until she did no inspection 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.809
 made no modifications 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:40.590
 accordingly, let's listen too 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:48.989
 how the station is aired fourth 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:51.390
 channel here we have 4 channel ale-ale times 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:56.000
 two three times two three times two three 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:01:00.030
 alyokha one two three times two three alyokha 123 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.870
 deaf there someone quietly lot 910 in 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.870
 910 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:20.159
 he has less of his volume 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:22.830
 ale-ale once two three times two three up 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:29.810
 one two three times two three 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:35.120
 aly-alya olya olya 123 and about seven 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:38.180
 symbol of your overall very good 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:41.160
 so what should be continued and 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.710
 dismantled the station conducted a full inspection 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.360
 before writing this piece 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.470
 video I was looking for a long time what it can 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.610
 was finding fault 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:54.420
 but honestly did not seem to find 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:56.550
 the products of the factory on the parties are really 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.240
 a bit grown up as it is noticeable 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:02.990
 150 each gadget yusin escalibur 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:07.140
 now here and understand the gadget 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:09.330
 555 probably have any defects on 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.750
 honestly here and so eyes they don't 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.610
 rush so everything is fine 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.520
 proceed directly to the finalization 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.340
 to be continued first of all we 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.220
 protect c transmission from breakdown 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:25.650
 set the zener diode here 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:28.200
 next we add one resistor 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:33.470
 here to adjust the mode of operation 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:43.440
 dx then replace one resistor here 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:45.590
 one here right here it will allow 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:48.299
 return the receiver gain to normal and 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.650
 operate as an automatic threshold 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:51.410
 noise suppressor and more correctly 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.250
 to be continued 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.170
 the next item is a revision 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:59.730
 threshold squelch and we replace 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:03.269
 the resistor here here is not one here 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:06.320
 here we add hysteresis by adding 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:08.519
 a resistor here and connecting these two points 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:12.739
 tuned threshold and noise pass here 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:12.739
 I have already adjusted these resistors 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:20.850
 the maximum degree of tightening 15 we 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:26.209
 should on two million be closed but 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:26.209
 on these refuse 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:33.510
 that's what's going on 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:35.819
 everything is adjusted normally continuation 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.650
 the next point is refinement 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:39.120
 automatic noise reduction we change 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.920
 his hysteresis watered here 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.719
 additional resistor now let's 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:53.489
 check its setting done this here 

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:56.609
 at this point with 112 111 approximately 1 12 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:58.379
 Volt and this is the norm automatic 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:00.540
 noise suppressor should work correctly 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:02.669
 continuation follows another important 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.099
 item refinement is the elimination of clicks 

00:04:02.669 --> 00:04:08.010
 when working shumodava we solder here 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:09.030
 here one capacitor cut the track 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:13.319
 here and 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:16.560
 on top of the resistor next 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:18.630
 item modulation refinement needed 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.549
 check us on this resistor here and 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:23.520
 if necessary replace it further 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:28.370
 this capacitor is removed and soldered 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:33.900
 and here we must also remove 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:37.020
 the capacitor here goes next 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:41.460
 completion of the filter on nutrition add 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:43.770
 one capacitor here and an extra 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:48.659
 protective diode here is the continuation 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:52.970
 it follows I mounted the connectors on the case 

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:55.800
 headset cord 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:58.050
 Now you need to collect everything and check how 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.870
 it works on air continued to be 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.820
 the work is almost completed we changed 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.710
 connector finalized noise suppressor and 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:07.320
 modulation let's hear how 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:11.090
 radio station is fourth live 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:15.360
 channel m here is the fourth channel 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:21.530
 quiet down ale-ale two or three times two three 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:26.300
 Alia, we want two three times two three ohls see 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:35.900
 778 watts 78 here we become 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:38.330
 now fm olya olya 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:39.919
 times two three times two three times two three one 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:44.150
 two three times two three 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:47.750
 ale-ale one two three times two three alyum 10 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:52.370
 watt clean good loud sound alo-ale 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:55.190
 I got a pretty call 2 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:57.710
 radio stations are fully ready i can and 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:58.490
 pack and send you thanks with him 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:01.150
 all the best 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.150
