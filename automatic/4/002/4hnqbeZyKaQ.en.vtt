00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120
 hello all beach figures today it works 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:08.370
 times the most important feeling in one 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.349
 diet and it 's not just the most important 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.750
 feeling that is also much more important than 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:17.190
 other things like calories 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.869
 count or petition micro models and 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.580
 so on and so forth though the 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.550
 of course have your authority 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.650
 but what is more important and have that 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.539
 I'm back in the last 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.630
 memorized a few days because I mean 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.120
 calories have drastically reduced that yes 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.100
 really the most important of all almost 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.899
 you could say maybe it can 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.000
 Guess if you have this picture here 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.510
 below you see what is the picture of one 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.309
 human stomach and one of the 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.989
 most important things there are 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:51.690
 they are simply that 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:53.760
 satiety why you can do a lot 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.309
 with the calories back and forth 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.530
 if you in the meals do eat 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.780
 you do not feel sufficiently saturated 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.000
 then your body will eventually become medium 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.549
 and ways how to find those calories 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.760
 and this satiety again 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:12.150
 gets or gets absolutely no matter if 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.119
 you want that or not and I have 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.470
 now my average 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:21.869
 calorie intake from 3500 to currently about 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:24.150
 2500 calories reduces everything in me 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.549
 At first she resisted everything in her 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.320
 said young are you crazy a lot 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.689
 too little fat yes you feel 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.540
 unbalanced and then one 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.670
 mistake makes you ignore that 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.270
 one intended for the satiety 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:42.509
 things are needed because, for example, on the stomach wall 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.000
 here yes where the crosses are there 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.790
 certain mechana receptors that are so 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.930
 smallest receptors and the report ever 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:54.180
 after how the stomach is stretched yes 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:56.100
 your brain, so to speak, whether you are full or 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.040
 that is not a part of the 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.259
 satiety to satiety 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.850
 contributes is the strain of the degree of 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.399
 such are for example such 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.200
 things like watermelon salad and so on 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.810
 very good because she has little 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.360
 But calories have a high volume 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.580
 so the stomach is now but those 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.890
 the problem that there are other things 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.599
 because you can so much watermelon 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.520
 eat like you want you will get through it 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:21.120
 not really you well and saturated 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.150
 feel 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.390
 There are, for example , receptors in the intestine 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:30.080
 yes the reported about whether the food 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.540
 contains enough nutrients 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.760
 and if you have too little now, for example 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.940
 calories then you will not 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.470
 have the right feeling of satiety and that 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.150
 but is also the reason at the same time 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.370
 why, for example, many people are fat 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.310
 stay or get fat because they are 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.200
 just a whole lot of calorie density 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.870
 Eat food like for example 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.430
 small almonds or small toffifee or 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.860
 whatever they are not 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.200
 have sufficient volume around the stomach 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.360
 to fill properly and then you eat eats 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.130
 you eat you are you more and more and you have 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.940
 you end up with so much calories 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.760
 recorded 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.110
 that is what we learn from it and that 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.420
 I am starting now from this diet 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.580
 also a bit wrong yes 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.130
 Incidentally, there are also receptors 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.019
 already in the mouth and even the eyes 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.030
 yes because I have an interesting study 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:20.100
 you even have your eyes even linked 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.540
 already the first receptors over it 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.739
 Report whether we are full or not 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.680
 So we always have to be careful 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.780
 Not only do we have enough volume 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.540
 and we have enough calories 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.609
 both at the same time I do not think so 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.160
 so much for getting that one 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:40.829
 diet somehow through the day snackt and 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.750
 always small meals is always 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:45.150
 small things that somehow 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.280
 have as few calories as that 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.769
 just does not cause you times 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:53.430
 really a satisfied sufficient 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:55.380
 Satiety have so much first 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.000
 and I think I just wanted to 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.620
 I have something else to say 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.850
 but now forget but I think so 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.680
 is clear what I mean 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.930
 Take care, for example, that you are too 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.090
 enough for your turkey steak 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:09.600
 for example, broccoli or 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:12.510
 Steamed carrots with eighth take 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.850
 that you stop to feed the 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.859
 has a high volume anyway 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.750
 a few more food with the takes 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.980
 Have enough calories with it or 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.290
 a feeling of fullness 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:23.640
 Well achieved and satisfied 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.710
 what we see each other next 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:29.360
