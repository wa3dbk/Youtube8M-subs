00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 how hand-to-hand fight is solved 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.980
 but we have painted a picture of you 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.800
 and it gives the opportunity to see and globally 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.540
 Now we reduce it to a minimum and 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:17.120
 speak hand to hand 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.120
 she is one of these such as here 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:23.010
 such third-party when they press that 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.900
 here I like it and use it 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.789
 turn on the very subject in this case on 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.160
 harvester and use it to 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.710
 could have been taken but not 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.510
 forget that you yourself have a knife on the island 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.210
 his strength was not heard by himself 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:48.090
 a little sideways when turning 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:49.579
 again you could earn like 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.010
 from here well we are not considering now 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:55.620
 elements of the application of the weapons it 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.440
 selection as soon as I selected it though 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.760
 broken she can serve you 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.020
 improvised means to tighten it 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.110
 or something urgent 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:07.140
 dosed some I use myself 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.159
 blade in order to pull up and he 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.740
 sits turning 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:15.549
 grip can be painful 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:18.280
 impact either under the root of the nose or 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:20.679
 hit the nose when the situation is 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.829
 what are we talking about before 

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:27.459
 about the criminal code and everything 

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:31.359
 the rest and when you have or know how 

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:34.000
 hold a weapon and turn them around when 

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:36.490
 selecting this weapon relying on the letter 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.950
 the law you know how to use it then 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:42.489
 have him stop but not causing him 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.549
 strong harm 

00:01:42.489 --> 00:01:48.789
 so you could not have an aperitif talking 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:50.860
 strong harm where when how much when 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:53.619
 In general, the whole list of questions that 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:57.840
 should be raised it should work 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:02:02.549
 just here when you have your head 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:12.670
 is friends with that law or shorter than the situation 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:14.500
 This is the situation up to 8 years 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.709
 run or something else concert 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.989
 not getting used you can and brought 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.639
 from under their roads until it hands 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:23.799
 can but i can't use 

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:26.620
 traitor a 2 for 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:27.549
 to this is the 9th and previous case 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.470
 turned 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:32.290
 I can pull it up with this hand 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.000
 throwing contact not to get on this 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.750
 on your hands kick your leg 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.799
 either using their own nomadic leg here 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.740
 and can take 5 on pain and on 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:45.620
 escort 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.630
 what are the passages and accompaniment I am interested in 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.440
 please do not consider because 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:53.330
 the setting is so bright and strong 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:56.540
 makes us think so barely alive 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:59.030
 his steel is barely alive so that it can be 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.490
 the flood he did not run away and he may have 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.060
 accomplices the moment of leaving was good 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.060
 let's say
