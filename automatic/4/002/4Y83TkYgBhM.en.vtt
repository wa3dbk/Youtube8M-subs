 organic raw materials iman dante kompost with composting poster 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.580
 recurring words in the language of the employees to one of the greatest problems of 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.919
 these times 

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:15.919
 the disposal of solid urban waste 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.220
 to 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.079
 the habit of throwing everything alloy has made my home is very recent 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.570
 until about forty years ago it was normal to keep the cards of 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.240
 wood for the stove 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.390
 empty bottles for urbino preserves 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.300
 fabrics for polymers 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.180
 food scraps were buried in the garden to enrich the earth 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.150
 or the animals went 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.660
 mistergo would be served in common 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.000
 once matured in the dunghill 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 to fertilize the fields 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.030
 practically up to 40 years ago the problem did not exist

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:27.569
 today in Italy 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.279
 we produce about 20 million tons of solid urban waste 

00:02:32.279 --> 00:02:37.459
 which are mostly sent indifference is so landfilled 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:58.889
 it is true that from far away 1982 presidential decree number 915 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:04.419
 many administrations have activated the separate collection of root paper 

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:06.849
 aluminum medicinal pills 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:09.849
 but the results have not been anywhere satisfactory 

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:13.699
 hence the need to develop a provincial plan 

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:17.339
 for the disposal of solid urban waste 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:29.199
 now the plan drawn up by the Lombard society resources and ready 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:33.069
 but to achieve the proposed objectives 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:36.450
 public awareness and information 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.450
 they are indispensable elements 

00:03:51.149 --> 00:03:55.269
 points of view puree of one of the bags that I love you daily 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:57.310
 in the bins contains 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.800
 plastic 15 wooden fabrics 10 v other 

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:03.299
 the organic fraction 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.359
 has the lion's share 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:09.009
 how to solve the problem of this 40% 

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:11.419
 consisting of organic waste 

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:12.609
 just three examples
