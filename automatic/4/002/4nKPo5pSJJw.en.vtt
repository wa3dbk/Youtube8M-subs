 lines I take this brush that 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.709
 would serve for the eyes but me 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:03.409
 I find it very well to go to blend the 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:07.730
 base cream with touring is this 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:10.840

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:30.400
 powder and lightly made tampono 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.380
 this we stop for a moment with the base 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.690
 One moment we turn to the eyes 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:42.010
 first product to put this pain 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:45.040

 makeup the eyes will use leilani that 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.700
 should be taken with a camel from 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.670
 nuance like this here for a 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.860
 wider shades to take naked 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.290

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:06.730
 clear and begin to fade the fold 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:09.430
 of the eye always with a brush from 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.530
 gradient use the max 2 of 17 17 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.739
 learn this darker brown

 This here is called the port bach 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:17.730
 always at the crease of the eye 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:27.340
 as for the eyelid 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:29.560
 mobile I go to combine this two colors 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.680
 color combo was not 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:35.560
 absolutely the fruit of my skill 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:38.440
 as for make-up but is a 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.750
 I suggest you say alessia that to the channel

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:48.250
 two colors and with in question are the 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:51.520
 according to this cuisine this 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:55.150
 very very shimmer reddish earth day 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:58.150
 he asks for this fantastic bronze rho 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:01.410
 ultra pigmented by combining these two 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:03.850
 colors comes out a bright color 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:08.740
 fantastic so it's not mine flour 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:12.220
 sack but it is an idea of ​​alessia that 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:15.460
 he did anyway during his tutorial 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:18.060
 so let's take sin and bring it to the 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.060
 mobile eyelid 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.880
 so let's take the bay we need 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:32.180
 bring just above the color 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:37.580
 having done this, I take 2 again 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:40.550
 17 and lightly blur the edges like a 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:43.310
 pen brush in this case use 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:45.830
 this pen that is always part of the set 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:50.240

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:52.490
 parcours this brown ones and it 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:55.130
 led slightly to the rhyme 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:58.550

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:06.400
 carbon black quick eyeliner 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:19.100
 as a further step I go to put 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:23.660
 the sting of the clique or number 28 

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:27.180
