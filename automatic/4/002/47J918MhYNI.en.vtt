00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:07.839
 good morning, I'm going to talk about how 

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:09.790
 I can change a thought for 

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:11.769
 start bringing what I want and not what 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.660
 what am I attracting 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:16.250
 for that we have to understand first 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:19.070
 how habits are formed 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.780
 so we can form new habits that 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.880
 annul the previous ones 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:27.180
 two conditions are required to form 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:31.620
 habits of thought on the one hand the 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.420
 repetition and on the other hand high impact 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:36.719
 emotional 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:40.769
 the repetition of course is necessary 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:43.530
 because it is without repetition it is impossible 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:46.050
 formation of a new habit do one and 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:50.170
 again the same thing makes every time 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:53.320
 it's easier and more automatic to do it 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.960
 now yes for several years we come 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.269
 thinking that you are fat and checking 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.879
 what in reality or do you come thinking that 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:03.190
 you always do poorly financially with 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:05.440
 just a week of thinking something new no 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.290
 It will be enough 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.510
 Suppose a chore as the 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.790
 brush your teeth tie your shoelaces 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:16.580
 of shoes or bathing 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.490
 we repeat these tasks over and over again 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.490
 once they automatically lack impact 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.829
 emotional 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:27.280
 the things that we consider important 

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:29.680
 they have another impact for us 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.500
 yes to our parents whom in 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.970
 general we consider important repeat 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.549
 again and again we are neat 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.619
 messy and smart cute 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:40.960
 etcetera our habits of 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:44.630
 thinking by repetition and impact 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:47.119
 emotional will tend to be similar 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:50.060
 your head does not stop generating the same 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:52.610
 thoughts again and again to generate 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.740
 new thinking habits that you 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.130
 allow you to attract whatever you want 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.670
 you need to remember the repetition and 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.670
 emotional impact 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.280
 let's now see how we do for 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:07.659
 have high repetitive stimuli 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.239
 impact 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:13.269
 we can use technology like the gun 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:16.140
 from the cell the wallpaper the 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:18.780
 harrington mouse icon on cell phone 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.550
 papers pasted to different places 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.760
 these things to more complex things 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:27.690
 as subliminal audios declarations 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.849
 of attraction manifestation posters 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:34.269
 you have to use everything within reach 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:37.390
 to bombard the brain with stimuli 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:39.130
 Massive high emotional impact 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.050
 what happens if they do not have to face 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:45.700
 computer does not matter you can search 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:47.620
 other systems your elastic band 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.810
 clothes an alarm of arrangements that you 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.390
 you agreed anything that when 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.600
 see again 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.280
 you must agree that is what you are 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.660
 thinking continuously and you think that it 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.120
 manifest 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.549
 and many people ask 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.640
 or I ask you to think that just by thinking 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:08.220
 this works the clear answer is that 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.020
 obviously I will not make attraction is very 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.210
 powerful but you have to help her 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.250
 If I want to be a millionaire, the law of 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:18.310
 attraction can make succeed one 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:21.040
 business but I still have to cheer up 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.720
 and start the business thought until the 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.510
 Secret film tends to confuse 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:28.480
 this point there is a scene in which Lee 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:31.390
 he drew a bicycle and the next day 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:35.260
 to visualize by thinking about this 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:38.470
 bicycle the bicycle appears in 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.750
 Grandpa 's hand doing nothing 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:44.200
 reality does not work without general not this 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:46.270
 compensate or visualize apply the law 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.400
 of attraction helps us to make the 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:51.870
 Required actions help us 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.870
 contact you with the right contacts 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.240
 to be in the right circumstances 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:01.850
 at the right time but it's not going to 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:04.400
 do for us if I'm looking 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.080
 lose weight will not do the push-ups of 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.730
 arm the abs or go for a run 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.830
 for us if I'm looking for a job 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.440
 will give me the perfect opportunity 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:14.750
 with the perfect contact but it will not go 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.820
 to the oral interview by us or go 

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.890
 to deliver the resume to us this 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:22.070
 you have to be clear about the action is 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:24.650
 fundamental for the things we want 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:28.790
 attract do not go so alone with wishing with 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:31.910
 with visualize them compensate it with 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:33.350
 repeat them and with the high impact 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:37.070
 emotional that we were talking about makes 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:38.889
 missing a dose of action to make them 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.749
 manifested the wishes 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:43.439
 well this is all for today we see the 

00:04:40.749 --> 00:04:43.439
 next video
