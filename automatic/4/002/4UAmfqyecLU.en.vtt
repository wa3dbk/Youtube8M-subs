of that but unfortunately the flavor

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.199 
of that but unfortunately the flavor
just<00:03:49.350> kind<00:03:50.350> of<00:03:50.410> goes<00:03:50.560> away<00:03:50.890> in<00:03:51.100> a<00:03:51.609> couple

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
just kind of goes away in a couple

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:54.030 
just kind of goes away in a couple
minutes<00:03:52.510> and<00:03:53.019> even<00:03:53.109> maybe<00:03:53.500> even<00:03:53.620> less<00:03:53.980> than

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
minutes and even maybe even less than

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.390 
minutes and even maybe even less than
that<00:03:54.430> you<00:03:54.940> know<00:03:55.030> it<00:03:55.150> doesn't<00:03:55.450> stay<00:03:55.690> around<00:03:56.400> but

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
that you know it doesn't stay around but

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.630 
that you know it doesn't stay around but
for<00:03:57.430> those<00:03:57.760> first<00:03:58.410> few<00:03:59.410> seconds<00:03:59.950> of<00:04:00.100> snorting

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
for those first few seconds of snorting

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.199 
for those first few seconds of snorting
is<00:04:00.850> just<00:04:01.299> absolute<00:04:01.989> bliss<00:04:02.350> I<00:04:02.739> mean<00:04:03.030> like<00:04:04.030> right

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
is just absolute bliss I mean like right

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
now I think the peanut butter is a

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.830 
now I think the peanut butter is a
little<00:04:05.470> bit<00:04:05.739> gone<00:04:06.150> but<00:04:07.150> the<00:04:07.269> chocolate<00:04:07.750> is

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
little bit gone but the chocolate is

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.099 
little bit gone but the chocolate is
still<00:04:08.049> there<00:04:08.709> and<00:04:09.069> that<00:04:10.000> was<00:04:10.150> the<00:04:10.390> bomb<00:04:10.600> for<00:04:11.079> a

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.109 
still there and that was the bomb for a

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:13.830 
still there and that was the bomb for a
little<00:04:11.319> while<00:04:11.500> and<00:04:11.880> it's<00:04:12.880> just<00:04:13.329> a<00:04:13.480> good<00:04:13.690> little

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
little while and it's just a good little

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.529 
little while and it's just a good little
concoction<00:04:14.350> that<00:04:14.799> you<00:04:15.010> can<00:04:15.220> mix<00:04:15.579> up<00:04:15.790> if<00:04:16.060> you

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:16.539 
concoction that you can mix up if you

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:21.539 
concoction that you can mix up if you
have<00:04:16.690> these<00:04:16.900> snuffs<00:04:19.769> you<00:04:20.769> know<00:04:20.889> I<00:04:20.919> like<00:04:21.459> to
