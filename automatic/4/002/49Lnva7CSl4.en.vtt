00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 GTA IV released for PC. 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
 People complain about being slow, unstable, missing textures, etc. 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 In addition, it requires the installation of Games for Windows, Flash, MSIE, SecuROM and Rockstar Games Club. 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 For SecuROM gave Rockstar $ 200,000. 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 I hope to play it with the highest graphics settings. 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 Sir... 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
 Tell him. 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 The highest setting is for future PCs, stronger than they are today. 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 Sorry, you won't be able to use this setting. 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 You who have GTA on consoles, out. 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 This is a fucking catastrophe! 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 How the fuck could happen! 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 We PC players have been waiting for it for 8 months! 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 To get these fucking problems! 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 Whore! 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 Another open port! 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 Why did they release the GTA in such a shitty state! 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 Again with PC players fucked! 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 I can't fucking believe it 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 But sir, the patch will come out soon. 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
 Shit! It has to work right away when they release it! 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 But at least you can play it. 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
 Now that framerate is shit and missing fucking textures! 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 Fuck fix! 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 Why can't you play it with the highest settings, 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
 when it's a console game 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 and the console can't even make a fucking Crysis! 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 Fucking sound like GTA has better graphics than Crysis 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
 but in reality it is just a demented program. 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
 A fucking fucking port! 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 GTA has no fucking antialiasing! 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 What dick PC game does not have antialiasing settings? 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
 Shit! 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 Shit, I was really looking forward to GTA. 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 Fucking god's game I've been waiting for for years. 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 But they fucked up. 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 Shit. 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
 I can't fucking believe they blew $ 200,000 for SecuROM! 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 Especially when she's totally shit as a pirate protection. 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
 It'll be better protected by the terrible quality. 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 Unreal how many extra shit you have to install to get it started. 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
 You're installing it forever, just to find out that fucking doesn't work! 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
 Don't cry, we have a console version. 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 Another blow steaming on the PC. 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 This PC gaming won't help. 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 Damn. 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
 They should realize what they have done. 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
 This is a good spot on the reputation of the GTA series 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
 Another company that had left the PCC. 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
 If they can't get a proper port, why are they straining. 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
 Catastrophe.
