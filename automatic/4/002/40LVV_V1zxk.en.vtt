heck<00:02:26.130> you<00:02:26.250> can<00:02:26.370> even<00:02:26.430> do<00:02:26.700> it<00:02:26.730> while<00:02:26.910> you're

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
heck you can even do it while you're

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.730 
heck you can even do it while you're
waiting<00:02:27.330> for<00:02:27.510> a<00:02:27.540> red<00:02:27.750> light<00:02:27.930> now<00:02:28.170> don't<00:02:28.680> do

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
waiting for a red light now don't do

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:29.570 
waiting for a red light now don't do
that<00:02:28.890> that's<00:02:29.040> not<00:02:29.100> safe

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
that that's not safe

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.130 
that that's not safe
it<00:02:29.970> even<00:02:30.240> gets<00:02:30.420> more<00:02:30.480> difficult<00:02:31.020> as<00:02:31.110> you

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
it even gets more difficult as you

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.750 
it even gets more difficult as you
progress<00:02:31.380> because<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:32.010> color<00:02:32.280> of<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:32.550> grid

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
progress because the color of the grid

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.030 
progress because the color of the grid
changes<00:02:33.060> to<00:02:33.450> a<00:02:33.480> less<00:02:33.810> visible<00:02:34.020> more<00:02:34.560> difficult

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
changes to a less visible more difficult

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.490 
changes to a less visible more difficult
to<00:02:35.160> read<00:02:35.340> grid<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:36.270> speed<00:02:36.660> and<00:02:36.930> velocity<00:02:37.050> of

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
to read grid the speed and velocity of

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.520 
to read grid the speed and velocity of
the<00:02:37.710> orbit<00:02:38.190> takes<00:02:38.730> place<00:02:39.120> and<00:02:39.360> so<00:02:39.900> it<00:02:40.080> is<00:02:40.200> just

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
the orbit takes place and so it is just

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.560 
the orbit takes place and so it is just
really<00:02:40.860> really<00:02:41.130> hard<00:02:41.430> to<00:02:41.670> come<00:02:41.880> out<00:02:41.970> alive<00:02:42.210> I

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
really really hard to come out alive I

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.030 
really really hard to come out alive I
really<00:02:43.230> don't<00:02:43.380> know<00:02:43.440> if<00:02:43.470> you<00:02:43.620> can<00:02:43.710> win<00:02:43.920> the

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
really don't know if you can win the

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.590 
really don't know if you can win the
game<00:02:44.250> I've<00:02:44.580> never<00:02:44.760> gotten<00:02:45.000> further<00:02:45.330> than<00:02:45.570> a

game I've never gotten further than a

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.630 
game I've never gotten further than a
couple<00:02:45.810> thousand<00:02:46.200> points<00:02:46.530> or<00:02:47.070> vitam<00:02:47.490> will

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
couple thousand points or vitam will

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.820 
couple thousand points or vitam will

for too long the cable will break then

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:29.680

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:29.690 
you have to start all the way over again

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:31.000 
you have to start all the way over again
and<00:05:29.840> that's<00:05:30.320> what's<00:05:30.500> going<00:05:30.650> to<00:05:30.710> happen<00:05:30.979> right

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.010 
and that's what's going to happen right

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:35.890 
and that's what's going to happen right
now<00:05:33.580> now<00:05:34.580> the<00:05:34.880> object<00:05:35.180> of<00:05:35.240> the<00:05:35.389> game<00:05:35.419> is<00:05:35.750> to

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
now now the object of the game is to

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.600 
now now the object of the game is to
collect<00:05:36.139> these<00:05:36.260> little<00:05:36.560> orange<00:05:36.770> cubes<00:05:37.370> I

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:37.610 
collect these little orange cubes I

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:39.520 
collect these little orange cubes I
think<00:05:37.909> they<00:05:38.000> look<00:05:38.210> like<00:05:38.360> lumps<00:05:38.750> kind<00:05:39.199> of<00:05:39.320> from

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.530 
think they look like lumps kind of from

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:40.600 
think they look like lumps kind of from
the<00:05:39.560> Rayman<00:05:39.919> series<00:05:40.190> if<00:05:40.340> you're<00:05:40.460> familiar

00:05:44.589 --> 00:05:44.599 
colorful diamonds that you can see above

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:48.889 
the level based upon how many lumps and

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:51.610 
the level based upon how many lumps and
diamonds<00:05:49.610> you<00:05:49.729> collected<00:05:50.210> that's<00:05:50.900> great<00:05:51.320> but

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:51.620 
diamonds you collected that's great but

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:53.379 
diamonds you collected that's great but
there<00:05:51.770> are<00:05:51.800> no<00:05:52.130> other<00:05:52.310> gaming<00:05:52.610> elements<00:05:53.210> which

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:53.389 
there are no other gaming elements which

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:55.089 
there are no other gaming elements which
is<00:05:53.570> kind<00:05:53.810> of<00:05:53.900> disappointing<00:05:54.080> I<00:05:54.650> wish<00:05:54.919> there

00:05:55.089 --> 00:05:55.099 
is kind of disappointing I wish there

00:05:55.099 --> 00:05:56.920 
is kind of disappointing I wish there
was<00:05:55.220> one<00:05:55.370> that<00:05:55.520> was<00:05:55.639> time-based<00:05:56.270> kind<00:05:56.599> of<00:05:56.720> cut

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:56.930 
was one that was time-based kind of cut

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:58.600 
was one that was time-based kind of cut
the<00:05:57.080> rope<00:05:57.260> style<00:05:57.590> where<00:05:58.130> you<00:05:58.250> have<00:05:58.370> to<00:05:58.490> go

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:58.610 
the rope style where you have to go

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.610 
the rope style where you have to go
quickly<00:05:58.940> I<00:05:59.240> think<00:05:59.690> that<00:05:59.960> would<00:06:00.080> be<00:06:00.110> more<00:06:00.380> wise

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:00.620 
quickly I think that would be more wise

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.379 
quickly I think that would be more wise
because<00:06:00.889> right<00:06:01.250> now<00:06:01.430> the<00:06:01.490> game<00:06:01.820> is<00:06:02.000> really

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:02.389 
because right now the game is really

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:04.149 
because right now the game is really
easy<00:06:02.630> if<00:06:02.930> you're<00:06:03.349> taking<00:06:03.710> your<00:06:03.830> time<00:06:04.010> in

00:06:04.149 --> 00:06:04.159 
easy if you're taking your time in

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:06.249 
easy if you're taking your time in
you're<00:06:04.280> cautious<00:06:04.520> so<00:06:05.330> that's<00:06:05.840> kind<00:06:06.169> of

00:06:06.249 --> 00:06:06.259 
you're cautious so that's kind of

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:07.540 
you're cautious so that's kind of
something<00:06:06.530> that<00:06:06.590> I<00:06:06.740> wish<00:06:06.949> they<00:06:07.130> would<00:06:07.280> change

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:07.550 
something that I wish they would change

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:08.860 
something that I wish they would change
because<00:06:07.909> when<00:06:08.060> you're<00:06:08.180> going<00:06:08.300> quick<00:06:08.659> and

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:08.870 
because when you're going quick and

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:10.839 
because when you're going quick and
you're<00:06:08.990> out<00:06:09.139> of<00:06:09.169> control<00:06:09.470> that<00:06:10.099> cable<00:06:10.580> breaks

00:06:10.839 --> 00:06:10.849 
you're out of control that cable breaks

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:12.969 
you're out of control that cable breaks
really<00:06:11.270> easily<00:06:11.870> and<00:06:12.349> so<00:06:12.470> that's<00:06:12.620> a<00:06:12.710> gaming

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:12.979 
really easily and so that's a gaming

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:14.110 
really easily and so that's a gaming
mechanic<00:06:13.370> I<00:06:13.460> would<00:06:13.580> have<00:06:13.669> hoped<00:06:13.849> they<00:06:13.970> would

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:14.120 
mechanic I would have hoped they would

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.730 
mechanic I would have hoped they would
have<00:06:14.210> fixed<00:06:14.389> but<00:06:15.110> if<00:06:15.289> you've<00:06:15.409> done<00:06:15.590> everything

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:15.740 
have fixed but if you've done everything

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.769 
have fixed but if you've done everything
