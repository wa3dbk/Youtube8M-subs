00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 Hello people I'm back with a desperate attempt here again 

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:07.020
 to get ahead 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.070
 from the 2 i have i have ideas and although this band is the solution of the catch 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.169
 I think I had overlooked something I had to go there 

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:17.029
 there is only one over this hook 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:20.029
 I mean I overlooked that 

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:24.430
 and now I'm trying here in the eye I could my luck Peters to me too 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:27.039
 nothing 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:29.909
 I think so 

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:31.210
 that I too 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.210
 Miserable failure will Emma 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.790
 you have to be more specific here 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.790
 I've seen that bad and little SAP 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.340
 I hope that's good too 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.800
 because we should not go here 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.590
 and be complete 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.590
 August 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.640
 so 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.640
 there are also as the 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.320
 whatever they take quickly 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.670
 so 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.120
 and then we can finally checkpoint many thanks 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.620
 finally take that other route the mix percent 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.980
 Stade 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.760
 good because I did it 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.760
 I was already desperate 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.660
 Not too hard at the power of my brain's terms 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.880
 but I blame it rather the faulty core design rightly not be for sale 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.880
 but Crystal Dynamics 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.880
 for this nonsense as it keeps pattering 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.989
 Bullerjahn 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:23.349
 more exact because not everyone has to 

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:28.139
 Oman Spain 

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:31.629
 to the party here 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:34.999
 and also the platform 

00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:38.679
 and here there is a Rhodes long which is really a good hideaway 

00:02:38.679 --> 00:02:40.999
 for the pipe wrench I have to say 

00:02:40.999 --> 00:02:43.299
 or Finn have no idea what power supply 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:46.399
 we do it so I believe that something activate 

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:47.809
 Yeah right 

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:50.809
 judge 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:54.480
 who it was was not right 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.759
 well hidden in the gym on the platform 

00:02:57.759 --> 00:03:00.439
 of course the best 

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:04.609
 the best thing is the best hiding place for something there is actually huddles 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:07.609
 I can do better 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:10.899
 not bad 

00:03:10.899 --> 00:03:13.899
 I come here too fast way 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.129
 and then go cigarettes so Weiger unfortunately all the way to the garden 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:27.129
 back 

00:03:29.779 --> 00:03:34.419
 May on her fun she played the game as I said on my point of view 

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:37.419
 beautiful 

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:45.589
 At that time, Lisa was miserably long corridor 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:52.689
 per year 

00:03:59.469 --> 00:04:01.749
 so 

00:04:01.749 --> 00:04:04.749
 It is not easy to turn on the water 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.409
 I know I am, but I do not know any more, especially when it comes to that 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:13.539
 water 

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:16.549
 I have to ask why do you have to do something in the room? 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.549
 Swimming pool is made you have to do something 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.180
 Arras what exactly was that I really do not know anymore 

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:40.969
 this is exactly what the water flows through 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:53.610
 Doz 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.610
 under the shower 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.580
 We will be there again as live-viewers 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.460
 unfortunately not 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.750
 it must now but I think he was in Oslo with the campfire 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.990
 do not control where as well 

00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:16.990
 Martin Allemann exactly 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.430
 Bruckheimer with water 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:21.939
 famously 

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:25.539
 What services did you do this yourself in a water friend 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.610
 not bad either 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.410
 But you have to see what the fireplace do that I know exactly 

00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:50.559
 AR 

00:05:50.559 --> 00:05:51.049
 Euro
