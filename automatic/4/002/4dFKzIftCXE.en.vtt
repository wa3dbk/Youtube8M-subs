00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.510
 hello everybody my name is AndrÃ© 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:58.980
 this video is to present to you the 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:04.050
 that gives you tx 562 car in this kit 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:06.509
 we must have x asks for the deaf tones and 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.289
 an exclusive tx asks trizone for the 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:10.590
 Cashier 

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:13.050
 The great differential of the xx asks is 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.050
 possibility of you playing in different 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:18.780
 does not give you a rebound 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.490
 very close to an acoustic battery in the 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:26.690
 of tx asks for a box 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.690
 we have the sound of skin rim and xote 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.150
 in the dishes 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:39.990
 we have the pci with 135 which are also 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:55.560
 trizone and provide the body dome sound 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:58.020
 edge at the foot of the plate is still possible 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.540
 apply but the show that also the system 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.540
 inverse already playing with it muffled 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:18.510
 Another great differential of this kit is the 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.090
 fact that it already accompanies a 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.100
 pinball and tie what makes it possible 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:27.260
 It is more natural to educate your 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:32.640
 instrument in the chimbau we have the hatch 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:35.640
 rh 135 of ozone and in the ped of butt we 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.550
 we have the hair and so where is it possible 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.660
 play perfectly with a simple pedal 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.660
 or a pedal 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.489
 Now I'll talk a little about the 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.090
 tx 502 module 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:03:00.570
 this module winds in battery pack 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:02.730

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:06.390
 where you can set up your own 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:10.560
 kit to set up your kit you have to 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:13.470

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.170
 percussion plates and effects 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.040

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.959

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:21.900

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:25.890
