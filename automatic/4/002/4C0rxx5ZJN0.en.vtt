smell<00:02:48.069> when<00:02:48.190> you're<00:02:48.310> applying<00:02:48.489> it<00:02:48.880> and<00:02:49.110> you'll

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
smell when you're applying it and you'll

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.470 
smell when you're applying it and you'll
probably<00:02:50.290> know<00:02:50.620> this<00:02:50.739> as<00:02:50.950> it<00:02:51.130> develops<00:02:51.640> it<00:02:51.849> the

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
probably know this as it develops it the

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.120 
probably know this as it develops it the
smell<00:02:52.690> will<00:02:52.870> get<00:02:53.019> a<00:02:53.170> little<00:02:53.470> bit<00:02:53.590> stronger<00:02:53.829> but

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
smell will get a little bit stronger but

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.280 
smell will get a little bit stronger but
then<00:02:54.220> once<00:02:54.400> you<00:02:54.519> shower<00:02:54.790> it<00:02:55.510> completely

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
then once you shower it completely

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.589 
then once you shower it completely
showers<00:02:56.709> it<00:02:56.829> off<00:02:56.950> so<00:02:57.340> that's<00:02:58.060> one<00:02:58.329> thing<00:02:58.480> that

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599

then you can

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:27.510 
then you can
always<00:04:26.470> take<00:04:26.650> like<00:04:26.830> a<00:04:26.860> lotion<00:04:27.070> or<00:04:27.310> a<00:04:27.370> body

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
always take like a lotion or a body

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.220 
always take like a lotion or a body
butter<00:04:27.850> and<00:04:28.090> put<00:04:28.240> it<00:04:28.360> on<00:04:28.450> your<00:04:28.570> dryer<00:04:28.840> spots

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
butter and put it on your dryer spots

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:30.630 
butter and put it on your dryer spots
before<00:04:29.620> you<00:04:29.710> put<00:04:29.860> this<00:04:29.950> on<00:04:30.130> and<00:04:30.400> that<00:04:30.520> will

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:30.640 
before you put this on and that will

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.700 
before you put this on and that will
help<00:04:30.820> it<00:04:31.030> not<00:04:31.210> be<00:04:31.510> so<00:04:31.780> concentrated<00:04:32.440> in<00:04:32.620> those

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
help it not be so concentrated in those

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.380 
help it not be so concentrated in those
drier<00:04:32.950> areas<00:04:33.340> because<00:04:33.610> if<00:04:33.730> you<00:04:33.850> don't<00:04:33.970> do<00:04:34.240> that

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
drier areas because if you don't do that

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.480 
drier areas because if you don't do that
then<00:04:34.960> you<00:04:35.110> may<00:04:35.200> have<00:04:35.380> darker<00:04:35.740> patches<00:04:35.950> but

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
then you may have darker patches but

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.550 
then you may have darker patches but
other<00:04:36.700> than<00:04:36.850> that<00:04:36.940> it's<00:04:37.690> really<00:04:38.020> simple<00:04:38.260> it's

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
other than that it's really simple it's

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.720 
other than that it's really simple it's
you<00:04:38.770> know<00:04:38.860> you<00:04:38.920> don't<00:04:39.100> have<00:04:39.280> to<00:04:39.370> do<00:04:39.490> anything

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:39.730 
you know you don't have to do anything

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:41.730 
you know you don't have to do anything
different<00:04:40.630> or<00:04:40.720> crazy<00:04:40.930> to<00:04:41.200> make<00:04:41.350> this<00:04:41.470> work

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
different or crazy to make this work

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.050 
different or crazy to make this work
even<00:04:42.130> though<00:04:42.250> it<00:04:42.400> comes<00:04:42.520> out<00:04:42.760> really<00:04:42.970> really

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
even though it comes out really really

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.510 
even though it comes out really really
dark<00:04:43.510> so<00:04:44.080> this<00:04:44.410> is<00:04:44.560> kind<00:04:44.830> of<00:04:44.920> revolutionary

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
dark so this is kind of revolutionary

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.730 
dark so this is kind of revolutionary
because<00:04:45.730> it<00:04:45.970> is<00:04:46.270> called<00:04:46.660> the<00:04:46.840> one<00:04:47.050> hour<00:04:47.290> tan

because it is called the one hour tan

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.490 
because it is called the one hour tan
now<00:04:48.190> there<00:04:49.090> is<00:04:49.330> another<00:04:49.540> brand<00:04:49.870> called<00:04:50.260> loving

now there is another brand called loving

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.200 
now there is another brand called loving
tan<00:04:50.830> and<00:04:50.980> they<00:04:51.040> have<00:04:51.190> a<00:04:51.220> two<00:04:51.490> hour<00:04:51.670> dark<00:04:52.000> mousse

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
tan and they have a two hour dark mousse

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:53.970 
tan and they have a two hour dark mousse
and<00:04:52.390> that's<00:04:52.630> really<00:04:53.170> really<00:04:53.380> dark<00:04:53.620> as<00:04:53.830> well

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:53.980 
and that's really really dark as well

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.250 
and that's really really dark as well
but<00:04:54.250> this<00:04:54.430> it<00:04:54.790> develops<00:04:55.270> them<00:04:55.360> in<00:04:55.630> an<00:04:55.720> hour<00:04:55.840> and

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.260 
but this it develops them in an hour and

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:57.870 
but this it develops them in an hour and
if<00:04:56.590> you<00:04:56.680> leave<00:04:56.860> it<00:04:56.950> on<00:04:57.010> for<00:04:57.250> two<00:04:57.400> hours<00:04:57.430> or

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
if you leave it on for two hours or

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.030 
if you leave it on for two hours or
three<00:04:57.910> hours<00:04:58.480> after<00:04:59.140> applying<00:04:59.590> it<00:04:59.800> then<00:04:59.890> it's

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:00.040 
three hours after applying it then it's

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.100 
three hours after applying it then it's
gonna<00:05:00.130> be<00:05:00.220> even<00:05:00.520> more<00:05:00.700> intense<00:05:01.210> so<00:05:01.540> that<00:05:01.900> you

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
gonna be even more intense so that you

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:03.570 
gonna be even more intense so that you
definitely<00:05:02.350> have<00:05:02.710> that<00:05:02.740> option<00:05:03.280> if<00:05:03.370> you<00:05:03.460> want

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580
