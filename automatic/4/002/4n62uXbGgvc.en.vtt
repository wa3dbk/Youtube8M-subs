pressure<00:00:34.140> as<00:00:34.290> you<00:00:34.320> meant<00:00:34.590> get<00:00:34.770> game<00:00:35.399> I<00:00:35.610> was

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
pressure as you meant get game I was

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.030 
pressure as you meant get game I was
really<00:00:36.210> down<00:00:36.360> about<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.750> atmosphere<00:00:37.110> for<00:00:38.010> a

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
really down about the atmosphere for a

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.590 
really down about the atmosphere for a
game<00:00:38.219> of<00:00:38.250> that<00:00:38.520> magnitude<00:00:38.850> to<00:00:39.120> be<00:00:39.239> that<00:00:39.390> quiet

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
game of that magnitude to be that quiet

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.270 
game of that magnitude to be that quiet
is<00:00:39.870> really<00:00:40.140> worrying<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.620> I<00:00:40.890> think<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.129> club

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
is really worrying and I think the club

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.319 
is really worrying and I think the club
were<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.489> blame<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.760> be<00:00:41.850> completely<00:00:42.120> honest

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
were to blame to be completely honest

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.850 
were to blame to be completely honest
with<00:00:42.390> you<00:00:42.510> I<00:00:42.660> think<00:00:42.899> they've<00:00:43.140> over<00:00:43.440> sanitized

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
with you I think they've over sanitized

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.619 
with you I think they've over sanitized
the<00:00:43.950> stadium<00:00:44.399> I<00:00:44.489> think<00:00:44.640> they<00:00:44.700> over<00:00:44.969> priced<00:00:45.510> out

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
the stadium I think they over priced out

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.319 
the stadium I think they over priced out
a<00:00:45.690> huge<00:00:46.020> generation<00:00:47.010> of<00:00:47.100> fans<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.489> something

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
a huge generation of fans and something

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.580 
a huge generation of fans and something
needs<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.719> something<00:00:49.289> needs<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.440> be<00:00:49.530> done

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
needs to something needs to be done

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.560 
needs to something needs to be done

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.310 
talents and he didn't do that he was
shockingly<00:01:50.970> bad<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:51.420> don't<00:01:51.990> think<00:01:52.140> that<00:01:52.170> we

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
shockingly bad I don't think that we

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.319 
shockingly bad I don't think that we

him<00:01:54.420> entirely<00:01:54.720> I<00:01:55.049> think<00:01:55.380> that<00:01:55.470> he<00:01:55.619> is<00:01:55.649> probably

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
him entirely I think that he is probably

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:54.599 
Chelsea's dip in form and the worse than
playing<00:02:53.829> soul<00:02:54.040> over<00:02:54.190> the<00:02:54.280> last<00:02:54.400> three<00:02:54.579> months

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:54.609 
playing soul over the last three months

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:56.580 
playing soul over the last three months
that<00:02:55.030> is<00:02:55.180> a<00:02:55.209> wonderful<00:02:55.629> question<00:02:55.959> Emma<00:02:56.349> I

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
that is a wonderful question Emma I

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.009 
that is a wonderful question Emma I
could<00:02:57.549> talk<00:02:57.670> about<00:02:57.790> this<00:02:57.910> for<00:02:58.060> all<00:02:58.750> day<00:02:58.900> long

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
could talk about this for all day long

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:01.800 
could talk about this for all day long
really<00:02:59.319> if<00:02:59.470> if<00:03:00.129> for<00:03:00.430> the<00:03:00.459> sake<00:03:00.670> of<00:03:00.730> this<00:03:01.000> I'm

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
really if if for the sake of this I'm

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.180 
really if if for the sake of this I'm
going<00:03:01.900> to<00:03:01.989> boil<00:03:02.170> it<00:03:02.260> down<00:03:02.290> to<00:03:02.410> one<00:03:02.709> point<00:03:02.950> and<00:03:03.129> I

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
going to boil it down to one point and I

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.009 
going to boil it down to one point and I
think<00:03:03.400> the<00:03:03.640> only<00:03:03.819> answer<00:03:04.030> I<00:03:04.120> can<00:03:04.209> give<00:03:04.329> you<00:03:04.599> the

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
think the only answer I can give you the

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:06.900 
think the only answer I can give you the
reason<00:03:05.440> that<00:03:05.590> we<00:03:05.739> had<00:03:05.859> such<00:03:06.040> a<00:03:06.069> dick<00:03:06.250> inform<00:03:06.579> to

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
reason that we had such a dick inform to

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.099 
reason that we had such a dick inform to
considering<00:03:07.390> how<00:03:07.480> great<00:03:07.690> the<00:03:07.780> beginning<00:03:08.019> of

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:08.109 
considering how great the beginning of

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:10.259 
considering how great the beginning of
the<00:03:08.170> season<00:03:08.319> is<00:03:08.650> fatigue<00:03:09.489> I<00:03:09.670> don't<00:03:10.090> think<00:03:10.239> that

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
the season is fatigue I don't think that

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.420 
the season is fatigue I don't think that
we<00:03:10.390> rotated<00:03:10.810> properly<00:03:11.590> around<00:03:12.010> the<00:03:12.129> Christmas

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
we rotated properly around the Christmas

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.099 
we rotated properly around the Christmas
period<00:03:12.609> and<00:03:12.940> I<00:03:13.030> think<00:03:13.090> that's<00:03:13.239> really<00:03:13.569> told<00:03:13.930> on

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:14.109 
period and I think that's really told on

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:16.770 
period and I think that's really told on
our<00:03:14.230> forum<00:03:14.530> and<00:03:14.739> I<00:03:15.459> just<00:03:15.640> think<00:03:15.910> that<00:03:16.000> I<00:03:16.510> think

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
our forum and I just think that I think

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.770 
our forum and I just think that I think
we<00:03:16.840> played<00:03:17.049> four<00:03:17.470> games<00:03:17.829> in<00:03:18.190> 14<00:03:19.090> days<00:03:19.269> or<00:03:19.480> 60

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
we played four games in 14 days or 60

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.930 
we played four games in 14 days or 60
days<00:03:20.049> over<00:03:20.680> christmas<00:03:20.709> and<00:03:21.220> it<00:03:21.579> was<00:03:21.700> the<00:03:21.790> same

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
days over christmas and it was the same

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.240 
days over christmas and it was the same
11<00:03:22.329> virtually<00:03:22.720> all<00:03:22.959> the<00:03:23.019> time<00:03:23.590> culminating

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
11 virtually all the time culminating

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.949 
11 virtually all the time culminating
the<00:03:24.400> Tottenham<00:03:24.700> result<00:03:24.970> yeah<00:03:25.480> and<00:03:25.599> I<00:03:25.840> think

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
the Tottenham result yeah and I think

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:27.300 
the Tottenham result yeah and I think
that's<00:03:26.260> probably<00:03:26.470> the<00:03:26.739> only<00:03:26.769> reason<00:03:27.220> I<00:03:27.250> can

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
that's probably the only reason I can

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.890 
that's probably the only reason I can
give<00:03:27.489> you<00:03:27.609> I<00:03:27.819> completely<00:03:28.269> agree<00:03:28.389> i<00:03:28.569> don't

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
give you I completely agree i don't

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.420 
give you I completely agree i don't

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430
