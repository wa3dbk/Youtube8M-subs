I'm<00:00:43.620> going<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.010> use<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:44.219> transition<00:00:44.700> wash<00:00:45.450> some

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
I'm going to use a transition wash some

I<00:00:56.220> won't<00:00:56.640> be<00:00:56.820> for<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.090> long<00:00:57.120> if<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:57.510> am<00:00:59.630> and<00:01:01.550> again

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:02.790 
I won't be for a long if I am and again

I won't be for a long if I am and again
if<00:01:02.880> some<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.630> this<00:01:03.750> bleeds<00:01:04.110> up<00:01:04.379> into<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.890> wash

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
if some of this bleeds up into the wash

if some of this bleeds up into the wash
I've<00:01:05.369> already<00:01:05.729> done<00:01:05.939> that's<00:01:06.210> just<00:01:06.750> fine<00:01:08.180> this

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
I've already done that's just fine this

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.780 
I've already done that's just fine this
is<00:01:09.390> just<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.780> really<00:01:10.619> beautiful<00:01:11.310> old<00:01:11.460> bridge

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
is just a really beautiful old bridge

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.539 
is just a really beautiful old bridge
but<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.240> is<00:01:12.390> so<00:01:13.310> so<00:01:14.310> full<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.759> character<00:01:15.329> and

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
but it is so so full of character and

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:24.350 
but it is so so full of character and
it's<00:01:17.549> been<00:01:17.729> there<00:01:17.880> for<00:01:18.090> centuries<00:01:22.970> so<00:01:23.970> part<00:01:24.240> of

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
it's been there for centuries so part of

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.330 
it's been there for centuries so part of
its<00:01:24.510> charm<00:01:24.600> is<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:27.500> rough<00:01:28.500> few<00:01:28.770> nature<00:01:29.220> of

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
its charm is the rough few nature of

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.130 
its charm is the rough few nature of
these<00:01:29.460> ancient<00:01:29.970> stones<00:01:32.270> so<00:01:33.270> I<00:01:33.299> don't<00:01:33.600> want<00:01:33.900> to

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
these ancient stones so I don't want to

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.020 
these ancient stones so I don't want to
clean<00:01:34.590> them<00:01:34.710> an<00:01:34.860> edge<00:01:35.010> to<00:01:35.340> make<00:01:35.460> it<00:01:35.520> look<00:01:35.640> too

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
clean them an edge to make it look too

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.990 
clean them an edge to make it look too
modern<00:01:36.650> so<00:01:37.650> I've<00:01:37.770> laid<00:01:37.950> in<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.250> darkest<00:01:38.670> dark

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
modern so I've laid in the darkest dark

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.490 
modern so I've laid in the darkest dark
that<00:01:39.210> I'm<00:01:39.299> going<00:01:39.510> to<00:01:39.540> use<00:01:39.659> there<00:01:39.990> which<00:01:40.229> is<00:01:40.350> not

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
that I'm going to use there which is not

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.660 
that I'm going to use there which is not
going<00:01:40.650> to<00:01:40.710> be<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.920> darkest<00:01:41.250> dark<00:01:41.460> in<00:01:41.580> the

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
going to be the darkest dark in the

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.230 
going to be the darkest dark in the
painting<00:01:42.060> of<00:01:42.180> course<00:01:42.420> but<00:01:42.690> it's<00:01:42.840> dark<00:01:43.229> or<00:01:44.240> then

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
painting of course but it's dark or then

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.969 
painting of course but it's dark or then
before<00:01:45.869> that<00:01:46.080> dries<00:01:46.530> I'm<00:01:46.740> going<00:01:46.920> to

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
before that dries I'm going to

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.060 
before that dries I'm going to
transition<00:01:47.400> into<00:01:47.700> its<00:01:48.060> complement<00:01:49.070> orange

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
transition into its complement orange

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.560 
transition into its complement orange
the<00:01:50.700> complement<00:01:51.270> of<00:01:51.360> blue<00:01:51.570> I<00:01:53.030> love<00:01:54.030> me<00:01:54.540> some

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
the complement of blue I love me some

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.999 
the complement of blue I love me some
cadmium<00:01:55.500> orange<00:01:56.720> so<00:01:57.720> I'll<00:01:57.990> transition<00:01:58.650> that

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
cadmium orange so I'll transition that

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.289 
cadmium orange so I'll transition that
blue<00:01:59.400> shadow<00:02:00.530> into<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.560> more<00:02:01.890> luminous<00:02:02.430> orange

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
blue shadow into a more luminous orange

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.499 
blue shadow into a more luminous orange
one<00:02:04.549> which<00:02:05.549> might<00:02:05.790> seem<00:02:06.060> counterintuitive

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
one which might seem counterintuitive

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.360

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
but actually if you really study nature

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.920 
but actually if you really study nature
there's<00:02:12.739> so<00:02:13.739> much<00:02:14.189> warm<00:02:14.819> tones<00:02:15.329> yellows
