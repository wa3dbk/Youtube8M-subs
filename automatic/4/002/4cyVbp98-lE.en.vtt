as problems with Idol there are a lot of

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.179 
as problems with Idol there are a lot of
reasons<00:00:06.870> for<00:00:07.109> it<00:00:07.379> I'm<00:00:07.500> going<00:00:07.620> to<00:00:07.680> cover<00:00:07.890> some

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
reasons for it I'm going to cover some

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.839 
reasons for it I'm going to cover some
of<00:00:08.250> them<00:00:08.460> here<00:00:09.410> basically<00:00:10.410> just<00:00:11.010> to<00:00:11.519> cover<00:00:11.700> the

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
of them here basically just to cover the

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.200 
of them here basically just to cover the
basics<00:00:12.269> again<00:00:12.389> when<00:00:13.200> you<00:00:13.349> start<00:00:13.679> your<00:00:13.889> car<00:00:14.210> the

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
basics again when you start your car the

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.810 
basics again when you start your car the
end<00:00:15.509> carburetor<00:00:15.990> would<00:00:16.289> be<00:00:16.529> dead<00:00:16.800> so<00:00:17.460> if<00:00:17.670> you

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
end carburetor would be dead so if you

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.700 
end carburetor would be dead so if you
start<00:00:18.150> it<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:18.480> it's<00:00:18.660> idling<00:00:19.050> take<00:00:19.350> off<00:00:19.500> your

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
start it and it's idling take off your

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.650 
start it and it's idling take off your
air<00:00:19.800> cleaners<00:00:20.189> make<00:00:20.789> sure<00:00:20.939> their<00:00:21.060> hands<00:00:21.240> just

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
air cleaners make sure their hands just

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.359 
air cleaners make sure their hands just
come<00:00:21.930> over<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.590> end<00:00:22.710> covers<00:00:23.070> you're<00:00:23.279> not

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
come over the end covers you're not

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.900 
come over the end covers you're not
trying<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:23.789> stop<00:00:24.090> any<00:00:24.330> air<00:00:24.570> if<00:00:25.080> you<00:00:25.289> do<00:00:25.470> that

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 
trying to stop any air if you do that

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.790 
trying to stop any air if you do that
and<00:00:26.910> it's<00:00:27.210> leaking<00:00:27.480> air<00:00:27.779> it'll<00:00:28.289> suck<00:00:28.619> your

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
and it's leaking air it'll suck your

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.200 
and it's leaking air it'll suck your
hand<00:00:28.830> down<00:00:29.189> pull<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.609> fuel<00:00:29.880> out<00:00:30.029> of<00:00:30.090> the

know it right away you won't yeah
but<00:00:36.380> anyway<00:00:37.380> check<00:00:37.680> let's<00:00:38.070> assume<00:00:38.340> that<00:00:38.399> you

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
but anyway check let's assume that you

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.720 
but anyway check let's assume that you
check<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:40.050> end<00:00:40.379> carburetors<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.190> they're

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
check the end carburetors and they're

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.110 
check the end carburetors and they're
not<00:00:41.910> leaking<00:00:42.149> air<00:00:43.100> then<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.309> focus<00:00:44.550> is<00:00:44.850> on<00:00:44.940> the

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
not leaking air then the focus is on the

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.959 
not leaking air then the focus is on the

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
it again if you still have a vacuum leak

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.800 
it again if you still have a vacuum leak
then<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:34.890> need<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.189> back<00:01:35.369> up<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.820> reseal<00:01:36.659> the

then you need to back up and reseal the
throttle<00:01:37.170> bodies<00:01:37.470> or<00:01:37.650> maybe<00:01:37.799> need<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.040> new

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.319 
you've resolved that still I'm in rough
and<00:01:44.460> no<00:01:45.119> vacuum<00:01:45.360> links<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:45.899> Nan<00:01:45.990> carburetors

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:47.329 
and no vacuum links and Nan carburetors

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:49.100 
and no vacuum links and Nan carburetors
basically<00:01:48.329> you<00:01:48.420> just<00:01:48.630> look<00:01:48.810> around

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
basically you just look around

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.510 
basically you just look around
everywhere<00:01:49.500> that<00:01:49.710> you<00:01:49.770> could<00:01:49.920> possibly<00:01:50.340> have

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
everywhere that you could possibly have

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.859 
everywhere that you could possibly have
a<00:01:50.549> vacuum<00:01:50.850> link<00:01:51.210> you've<00:01:51.390> got<00:01:51.540> your<00:01:51.689> power

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
a vacuum link you've got your power

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.319 
a vacuum link you've got your power
steering<00:01:52.259> or<00:01:53.070> I'm<00:01:53.340> sorry<00:01:53.549> power<00:01:53.850> brake<00:01:54.090> line

you<00:01:54.600> can<00:01:54.780> check<00:01:55.049> make<00:01:55.649> sure<00:01:55.829> there's<00:01:56.009> no

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
you can check make sure there's no

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.149 
you can check make sure there's no
vacuum<00:01:56.579> leaks<00:01:56.790> in<00:01:57.030> there<00:01:57.799> I've<00:01:58.799> had<00:01:58.979> people

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
vacuum leaks in there I've had people

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.130 
vacuum leaks in there I've had people
say<00:01:59.340> that<00:01:59.700> the<00:01:59.850> booster<00:02:00.450> leaks<00:02:00.689> I<00:02:00.930> think

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
say that the booster leaks I think

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.510 
say that the booster leaks I think
that's<00:02:01.350> pretty<00:02:01.649> rare<00:02:01.950> but<00:02:02.130> if<00:02:02.250> you're<00:02:02.369> really

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
that's pretty rare but if you're really

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.100 
that's pretty rare but if you're really
concerned<00:02:02.640> about<00:02:03.240> that<00:02:03.390> you<00:02:03.450> could<00:02:03.719> pull<00:02:03.960> this

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
concerned about that you could pull this

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.459 
concerned about that you could pull this
off<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.500> booster<00:02:04.920> and<00:02:05.159> cap<00:02:05.460> it<00:02:06.259> I've<00:02:07.259> also

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
off the booster and cap it I've also

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.150 
off the booster and cap it I've also
seen<00:02:08.330> vacuum<00:02:09.330> leaks<00:02:09.569> at<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.959> up<00:02:10.080> fitting<00:02:10.440> so

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
seen vacuum leaks at the up fitting so

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.380 
seen vacuum leaks at the up fitting so
you<00:02:11.220> might<00:02:11.520> want<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:11.790> check<00:02:11.970> if<00:02:12.150> you<00:02:12.209> have<00:02:12.239> a

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
you might want to check if you have a

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
you might want to check if you have a
plastic<00:02:12.599> fitting

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
plastic fitting

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.920

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
aftermarket ones can break so check to

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.430 
aftermarket ones can break so check to
make<00:02:18.150> sure<00:02:18.210> there's<00:02:18.480> no<00:02:18.660> leaks<00:02:18.840> around<00:02:19.260> here

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
make sure there's no leaks around here

they get old and brittle and you could

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.280 
they get old and brittle and you could

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
have a vacuum leak there so you want to

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.780 
have a vacuum leak there so you want to
try<00:02:37.470> and<00:02:37.560> eliminate<00:02:37.620> all<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.190> vacuum<00:02:38.580> leaks

next thing I would you know probably by

over that in the next section that how

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.470 
over that in the next section that how

be where you're having a problem so

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.459 
be where you're having a problem so
again<00:03:21.680> check<00:03:22.680> for<00:03:22.739> vacuum<00:03:23.219> leaks<00:03:24.260> make<00:03:25.260> sure

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:25.469 
again check for vacuum leaks make sure

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:28.190 
again check for vacuum leaks make sure
you<00:03:25.640> focus<00:03:26.640> your<00:03:26.939> attention<00:03:27.180> on<00:03:27.510> on<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:28.049> end

you focus your attention on on the end

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.899 
you focus your attention on on the end
carburetors<00:03:28.799> and<00:03:28.829> vacuum<00:03:29.250> links<00:03:29.489> before<00:03:29.640> you

00:03:29.899 --> 00:03:29.909 
carburetors and vacuum links before you

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:32.569 
carburetors and vacuum links before you
worry<00:03:30.060> about<00:03:30.180> the<00:03:30.480> center<00:03:31.019> carburetor<00:03:31.549> what<00:03:32.549> a

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
worry about the center carburetor what a

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:35.020 
worry about the center carburetor what a
lot<00:03:32.760> of<00:03:32.819> people<00:03:33.060> are<00:03:33.180> recommending<00:03:33.450> and<00:03:33.959> I

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
lot of people are recommending and I

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.759 
lot of people are recommending and I
guess<00:03:36.030> it's<00:03:36.480> not<00:03:36.689> a<00:03:36.750> bad<00:03:36.989> idea<00:03:38.209> you<00:03:39.209> could<00:03:39.420> make

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
guess it's not a bad idea you could make

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.349 
guess it's not a bad idea you could make
solid<00:03:40.769> gasket<00:03:41.400> out<00:03:41.549> of<00:03:41.670> wood<00:03:41.849> why<00:03:42.150> would

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:42.359 
solid gasket out of wood why would

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:44.690 
solid gasket out of wood why would
anything<00:03:42.569> and<00:03:42.870> put<00:03:43.409> a<00:03:43.859> blocking<00:03:44.459> plate

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
anything and put a blocking plate

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.270 
anything and put a blocking plate
between<00:03:44.909> the<00:03:45.239> carburetor<00:03:45.780> and<00:03:46.049> the<00:03:46.280> manifold

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
between the carburetor and the manifold

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.280 
between the carburetor and the manifold
that<00:03:47.310> would<00:03:47.790> seal<00:03:48.090> it<00:03:48.120> completely<00:03:48.329> but<00:03:49.079> I

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
that would seal it completely but I

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.050 
that would seal it completely but I
don't<00:03:49.769> really<00:03:49.889> think<00:03:50.040> that's<00:03:50.250> necessary<00:03:50.909> if

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
don't really think that's necessary if

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.819 
don't really think that's necessary if
you<00:03:51.209> if<00:03:51.569> you've<00:03:51.750> eliminated<00:03:51.959> if<00:03:52.409> you<00:03:52.530> can<00:03:52.680> put

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
you if you've eliminated if you can put

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:54.110 
you if you've eliminated if you can put
your<00:03:52.950> hand<00:03:53.129> over<00:03:53.280> the<00:03:53.400> end<00:03:53.430> carburetors<00:03:54.090> and

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
your hand over the end carburetors and

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.259 
your hand over the end carburetors and
feel<00:03:54.510> very<00:03:54.840> little<00:03:55.139> to<00:03:55.230> no<00:03:55.409> vacuum<00:03:56.040> pull<00:03:56.459> I

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
feel very little to no vacuum pull I

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.000 
feel very little to no vacuum pull I
don't<00:03:57.629> see<00:03:57.780> that<00:03:57.900> that's<00:03:58.109> necessary<00:03:58.709> but<00:03:58.919> it

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
don't see that that's necessary but it

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.789 
don't see that that's necessary but it
certainly<00:03:59.220> is<00:03:59.579> a<00:03:59.609> surefire<00:04:00.329> way<00:04:00.780> to<00:04:01.049> make<00:04:01.470> sure

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
certainly is a surefire way to make sure

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:03.920 
certainly is a surefire way to make sure
you<00:04:01.889> you<00:04:02.669> know<00:04:02.790> you<00:04:02.849> have<00:04:03.150> no<00:04:03.239> many<00:04:03.419> leaks<00:04:03.720> in

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
you you know you have no many leaks in

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.909 
you you know you have no many leaks in
that<00:04:04.079> area<00:04:05.540> those<00:04:06.540> those<00:04:06.840> are<00:04:06.870> the<00:04:07.650> primary

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:07.919 
that area those those are the primary

they tried those things they're if they

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.509 
they tried those things they're if they
