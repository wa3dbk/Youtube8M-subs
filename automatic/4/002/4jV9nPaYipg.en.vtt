00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:08.350
 with almost 25% of consumption 

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:10.240
 of energy and 46 % of the production of 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:12.370
 greenhouse gas building 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.330
 constitutes a source of savings and 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.330
 preservation of the planet 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.920
 france has set itself the goal of 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.930
 thermally rehabilitate 500 thousand 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.390
 housing per year across the 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.939
 brittany that represents some 25,000 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.820
 housing and more than 3,000 per year for 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:33.340
 reindeer agglomeration buildings 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.410
 of housing public buildings of 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.360
 teaching offices generally 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.920
 occupied will have to be isolated by 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.530
 outside to limit nuisances 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.570
 and the two dwellings and panels 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.360
 prefabricated wood belt meet 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.489
 to this problem 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.379
 the associated regional council of brittany 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.750
 arranged to architects and maryvonne 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:54.220
 Rigourd chose this solution for the 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:58.120
 rehabilitation of the high school internate 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.979
 chateaubriand to reindeer he must undergo a 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.440
 complete restructuring of the rooms 

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:05.290
 with security compliance and 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.960
 thermal insulation concrete structure 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.510
 consists of structural columns and 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.400
 concrete slabs between wall posts 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.780
 bricks were filed to be 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.810
 replaced by structural panels 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:20.350
 prefabricated wood in workshop near isolated 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:22.600
 equipped with new joinery besides 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.310
 the echo bulot wood benefits the 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.810
 prefabricated frames allow 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.119
 reduce the duration of intervention on 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.369
 site to reach a high level of 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:33.009
 thermal performance and to overcome 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.450
 of the existing faÃ§ade grid in 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.149
 authorizing a reorganization 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.429
 functional double single rooms 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:41.020
 and triples instead of four-room 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:43.119
 initials 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.500
 the realization of this project assumes 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.499
 a study and design phase 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.179
 important indeed the use 

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:51.609
 of pre-made wood elements made in large 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:53.200
 dimensions requires near knowledge 

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:55.590
 millimeters of the geometry of 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.719
 structure on which they will be fixed 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.390
 the carpenter's work attend the 

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:03.249
 name of specialized providers consists 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.429
 to redesign the structure 

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:06.939
 existing at actual coasts this work 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:08.800
 realized 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:10.300
 we must then designate all 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.910
 structural details of the frame 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.170
 bring up to the finishing elements 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.480
 outer 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.489
 to demonstrate the capabilities of the 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.530
 Breton wood sector it was made the 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.970
 choice to use sitka spruce 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.849
 from the forest resource 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.890
 regional government, thus promoting 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:29.440
 and professionals Breton wake 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.230
 are dried to 18% moisture for 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.090
 get dimensional stability 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.160
 cuira beauty before being delivered to 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.489
 the company hoist wood retained for this 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.530
 construction site once all the details of 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:43.810
 validated design in frame session 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.580
 the manufacture of the frames can 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.930
 start 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.580
 the characteristics of each element 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.989
 constituent of the framework are 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.530
 transmitted to workshop machines 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:55.180
 from the software of the design office 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.790
 they are cut to length and then 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.069
 assembled on a camera operator to train 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.170
 the frame laying the panels of 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.540
 bracing stiffens the whole 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:08.549
 different cuts and openings 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.549
 are then realized by the machine 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.530
 the manufacturing continues with the installation of 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:16.660
 insulating films by steam and park him 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.860
 the installation of joinery and 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.860
 possibly the cladding 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.870
 the walls are then ready for shipment 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:29.480
 to the building site lifting frames 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.040
 can then start three companions 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.950
 are needed for handling and 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.630
 fixation 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.640
 we notice that the cladding was not 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.110
 mounted on the panels to the outfit but 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.380
 it's entirely possible according to 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.910
 configurations 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.769
 once the panel is positioned on 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.050
 attaches it with splinters 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:50.209
 metal a semi rigid insulation in 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.790
 rock wool ensures a junction between 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:54.319
 the wall to be carried and the supporting structure 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.440
 airtight connections 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:58.940
 can then be realized the parish 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.790
 can then be dubbed 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.890
 interior finish 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:07.370
 outside the parish is ready to 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.840
 receive a cladding 1500 square meters 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.030
 insulating panels and carpentry 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:14.540
 will be able to be posed in 4 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:16.400
 ascent this speed of execution 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.079
 is a major asset for the intervention 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.489
 in occupied site 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:21.350
 the main intervention 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:23.900
 housing that can be reduced to one 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.640
 day the month technique allow 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.680
 also the elevation of buildings 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:30.729
 existing ones contributing to densification 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:33.890
 urban and architectural renewal 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:35.539
 high potential wood solutions that 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:38.770
 will win to be known to the masters of 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:38.770
