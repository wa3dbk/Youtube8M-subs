 hello to all my friends from youtube I'm 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:15.320
 happy because my channel has grown 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:18.080
 quite in these last months a lot 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:21.230
 people have joined this channel not 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:26.050
 only to learn about the tablet 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:28.760
 but on other tablets with 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.900
 similar features in this tablet 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:35.090
 and that my procedures and videos and 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.040
 the other games have worked in 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.140
 this time we are going to uninstall a 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.440
 application that comes pre installed in the 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.440
 system 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:48.220
 for example I want to uninstall this 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:50.280
 camera application if we see here 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.300
 in the application information 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.860
 he just does not know the option of 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:58.260
 disable no more does not appear in 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.970
 where you do not know should appear 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.820
 uninstall appears without enabling 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:06.460
 this disable does not appear the 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.560
 uninstall disinflation then 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.920
 as we do we have to have 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:17.730
 rooted our tablet and with this 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.730
 application is from files explorer 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.520
 let's 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.520
 let's try to install this 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:30.550
 camera application not 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:34.810
 let's go to the explorer group here 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:38.920
 and then we go here where you want 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:41.830
 install system app we look for the 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.280
 application that we want to install is this 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.830
 of camera up here 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.560
 press and hold it pressed by a 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.680
 moment until this menu appears 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.810
 the right 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:58.200
 first that is to uninstall them we press 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.870

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:08.930
 and we get a message that they will say 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:13.650
 that this application is being installed 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:19.350
 we believe in accepting and automatically 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:24.620

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:28.190
