 and they can enter a hundred concentrates and that's what it's about 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.310
 when it starts in October 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.560
 to get ahead people 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.860
 the first thing to do is enter the trial between boos after 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.910
 run 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.910
 in the search engine we know cmb 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.210
 let's accept 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.550
 if she disappeared, she is excited 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.550
 and that is what we did and this with 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.840
 / arc between lines 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:01.920
 bouquets 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.720
 to Internet 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.900
 i will lisandra this lippi cuadrito academia 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.300
 good close in costa rica and mexico 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.270
 it will be a window 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.270
 then if you gain control panel 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.260
 between herd network connections 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.890
 here the local area manager will appear 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.250
 with this union 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.320
 this 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.210
 we go to properties by the way there are 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.090
 minervén this 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.240
 in general 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.130
 everyone with his figure 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.440
 inc 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.799
 it was showing brochures protocol internet sp barrel p 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:44.690
 What they want 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.260
 and I think there's 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:47.840
 in general 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.210
 in hospitality first option is 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.210
 place using the following address this 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 vickiana and here in the east 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.520
 they put anything 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:07.080
 I mean you do not have to go over the value of 2 55 the end is André terror 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.460
 then we put for example 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.880
 122 255 111 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:17.779
 154 

00:02:17.779 --> 00:02:19.779
 and it's the fifth 

00:02:19.779 --> 00:02:21.190
 for blind gold 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.709
 then he has opposed masking his network 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.099
 just click want gil and the third automatically 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:33.279
 the question do not touch anything else just click on the sector 

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:36.089
 finally accept 

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:39.089
 they arrived little 

00:02:40.429 --> 00:02:42.339
 good once it is closed 

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:46.559
 again campaigns with cement and brick what we know that if they were 

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:47.499
 invited 

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:50.249
 piquet say that a hype was found 

00:02:50.249 --> 00:02:52.949
 I want the one that is not 

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:54.829
 justice is to say 

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:57.829
 for these we propose properties again 

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:02.479
 again the internet protocol that is pitted 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:07.680
 i change the option to use the following direction and fishing get a 

00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:10.679
 illiquidity automatically issues 

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:17.139
 on Monday that angelica we are to mushrooms not to accept 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:19.759
 and here 

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:21.139
 quilmes 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:22.219
 percent 

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:25.599
 they found this act matica want me and they will see what 

00:03:26.179 --> 00:03:28.399
 dangerous the similar idea 

00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:31.189
 with the palera connected this means 

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:35.229
 that is internet you heard mind connect with olic that is not 

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:41.129
 this can be verified by entering the internet putting no activist 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:44.540
 seeing at the beginning of every suite 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:45.869
 after saw 

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:49.089
 do this process that has touched you strict 

00:03:49.089 --> 00:03:53.609
 and come back into play the foot and adherents cabernet and has changed 

00:03:55.149 --> 00:03:58.999
 with this you can enter a sernac in this one which the bombing 

00:03:58.999 --> 00:04:00.889
 permanently 

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:03.290
 now to take out in the local 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:08.019
 much simpler or that there is a program that automatically 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:12.749
 is that it will be or any section 7 of any of its versions 

00:04:13.249 --> 00:04:17.739
 this case the harsh reality want education you say 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.979
 that spied 8 points 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:24.449
 percent as they were here 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:27.650
 good percent if you have open or sectoral 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:29.740
 the first thing you have to do 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.270
 percent close it here is being charged by breeders was to show them 

00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:39.669
 the 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:42.740
 neither did he get into chaos after going 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.860
 good there are serious 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.860
 by the way they were cynthia of 11 points 

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:49.979
 percent for 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:51.789
 they do not close 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:54.789
 and then they unload the terror to Rome 

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:57.009
 what do I want 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:04:59.139
 in files of once 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:00.379
 these cases 

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:01.650
 it is saved 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.059
 inherited a force in the auditory version what is 0 

00:05:06.059 --> 00:05:09.059
 thirty-three 33 points to 1 

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:11.319
 this 

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:14.910
 here in belgium and it is a series of inconveniences 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:19.800
 it's my breath it's because I have not had time to study it but 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.080
 death 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.759
 the media are companions 

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:28.759
 referee bouquets 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:35.339
 By the way, they already discount acquiring know Chavez and the icon they were 

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:37.059
 have a count 

00:05:37.059 --> 00:05:39.610
 I see it from that count 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.610
 if perhaps the 6th chile yesterday station 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.710
 fight here 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:47.199
 load to this 

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:48.690
 and finally do 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.490
 to be sporting 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:57.050
 when that was automatically very fast -13 from this ii from that aspect 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.309
 these five 

00:05:59.309 --> 00:06:02.839
 here is that the rare 'kaiser' is accelerated 

00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:06.759
 this one was hugo 

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:08.150
 local sugar 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.119
 GM is successful 

00:06:10.119 --> 00:06:13.009
 is going to close the lenin 7 folder 

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:15.949
 can be brought with but everything has been at peace 

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:18.430
 he did clarify what 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:21.689
 if I did act to get it out 

00:06:21.689 --> 00:06:25.270
 he goes out to tell it comes out becerra lenin center 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:29.470
 When closing premises that want to enter, these advisors must 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:31.869
 jails in premises 

00:06:31.869 --> 00:06:34.379
 this is always true 

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:37.779
 is that there will be eight veterans 

00:06:37.779 --> 00:06:40.789
 the western sector what has led me to tutorial 

00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:43.719
 be as specific as possible 

00:06:43.719 --> 00:06:46.689
 chimera the collapse of diego 

00:06:46.689 --> 00:06:48.939
 and I hope they encourage 

00:06:48.939 --> 00:06:49.580
 thank you
