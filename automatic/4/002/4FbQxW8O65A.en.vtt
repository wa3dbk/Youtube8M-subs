00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
this is just how i do it there's really

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:43.580 
this is just how i do it there's really
nothing<00:05:40.770> to<00:05:41.130> it<00:05:41.340> just<00:05:41.790> be<00:05:42.510> very<00:05:42.660> careful<00:05:42.810> and

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590 
nothing to it just be very careful and

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.210 
nothing to it just be very careful and
don't<00:05:43.950> burn<00:05:44.160> yourself<00:05:44.310> that's<00:05:45.210> it

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:47.220 
don't burn yourself that's it

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:55.150 
don't burn yourself that's it
you<00:05:47.310> want<00:05:47.490> to<00:05:47.580> like<00:05:47.880> for<00:05:48.090> your<00:05:48.240> personal<00:05:48.750> use

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:55.160 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.250 

now<00:05:55.790> usually<00:05:55.940> just<00:05:56.240> took<00:05:56.480> the<00:05:56.690> spoon<00:05:57.020> like

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:57.260 
now usually just took the spoon like

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.490 
now usually just took the spoon like
this<00:05:58.300> because<00:05:59.300> it's<00:05:59.450> still<00:05:59.720> melting<00:06:00.170> so<00:06:00.380> it's

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:00.500 
this because it's still melting so it's

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:08.720 
this because it's still melting so it's
still<00:06:00.710> dripping<00:06:01.370> color

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:08.730 

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:12.260 

so<00:06:09.730> then

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:12.270 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:16.940 

this<00:06:12.900> is<00:06:13.260> what<00:06:13.710> it<00:06:13.860> should<00:06:13.890> look<00:06:14.190> like<00:06:15.710> just<00:06:16.710> in

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:16.950 
this is what it should look like just in

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:19.580 
this is what it should look like just in
there<00:06:17.130> like<00:06:17.340> that<00:06:17.690> and<00:06:18.690> then<00:06:18.840> this<00:06:19.020> is<00:06:19.200> my<00:06:19.350> red

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:19.590 
there like that and then this is my red

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:25.160 
there like that and then this is my red
one<00:06:19.800> that<00:06:19.980> I<00:06:20.010> just<00:06:20.310> did<00:06:23.780> and<00:06:24.780> I<00:06:24.870> should<00:06:25.080> look

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:25.170 
one that I just did and I should look

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:30.730 
one that I just did and I should look
like<00:06:25.230> that<00:06:26.630> very<00:06:27.630> easy<00:06:28.670> this<00:06:29.670> one<00:06:29.910> I<00:06:30.150> was<00:06:30.300> lazy

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:30.740 
like that very easy this one I was lazy

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.440 
like that very easy this one I was lazy
so<00:06:31.740> I<00:06:32.070> just<00:06:32.340> pretty<00:06:32.550> much<00:06:32.640> just<00:06:33.030> took<00:06:33.270> my

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:33.450 
so I just pretty much just took my

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:36.770 
so I just pretty much just took my
lipstick<00:06:33.990> out<00:06:34.170> and<00:06:34.560> just<00:06:35.190> smashed<00:06:35.700> it<00:06:36.030> either

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:36.780 
lipstick out and just smashed it either

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:40.730 
lipstick out and just smashed it either
way<00:06:37.080> it<00:06:37.410> works<00:06:37.800> I<00:06:38.370> mean<00:06:39.210> just<00:06:39.440> burning<00:06:40.440> it<00:06:40.530> like

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:40.740 
way it works I mean just burning it like

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.650 
way it works I mean just burning it like
that<00:06:40.920> you<00:06:41.160> just<00:06:41.190> get<00:06:41.580> a<00:06:41.610> flat<00:06:41.910> surface<00:06:42.180> that

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:42.660 
that you just get a flat surface that

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:43.940 
that you just get a flat surface that
way<00:06:42.810> you<00:06:42.870> can<00:06:43.050> just<00:06:43.080> scoop<00:06:43.440> a<00:06:43.530> little<00:06:43.560> bit<00:06:43.830> out

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:43.950 
way you can just scoop a little bit out

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:45.950 
way you can just scoop a little bit out
either<00:06:44.520> way<00:06:44.790> it's<00:06:44.970> fine<00:06:45.180> I<00:06:45.390> don't<00:06:45.540> really<00:06:45.660> care
