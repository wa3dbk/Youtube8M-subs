00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.269
 here 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.420
 many of us have used a 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.850
 conventional keyboard for both tasks 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.170
 desktop as for gaming but 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.939
 There comes a time when we 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.539
 we propose to make the leap to a more keyboard 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.519
 specific 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.470
 still the investment in a keyboard of 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:29.239
 this guy may feel risky already 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.470
 not only for the price but for the 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:32.320
 functions that we expect from a keyboard 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.720
 gaming 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.510
 We already presented the solution this week 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.950
 what coolermaster he had for us and 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.030
 now we bring you the last of the 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.030
 Spanish of tacens 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.600
 since they started in 2005 have 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.430
 introduced a multitude of products and in 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.950
 this time they bring us their marsÃ© line of 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:55.170
 peripherals we concretely have the 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:55.170
 mk1 keyboard and mouse m / m 1 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.129
 lm one is a mouse that could well have 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.809
 been for ministers only with the detail 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.180
 of not having included the buttons more in 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.369
 the right side is about a mouse 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.530
 Ergonomically speaking totally 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.540
 symmetrical 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.040
 It has an adequate size that you will like 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.229
 both those that we have hands 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.140
 small ones like those with a size of 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.479
 top hand 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.820
 It is also made of polycarbonate 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:24.229
 with a subtle difference to the rest and is 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.300
 that its upper part is covered with 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:29.020
 non-slip teflon something that turns out 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.820
 very pleasant to the touch 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.679
 details like a gold-plated connector 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.450
 and meshed cable of a length of 2 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:36.659
 meters will give you more 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.659
 durability 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.830
 It also has 6 buttons 2 located 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.860
 on the left side a central button 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.730
 in the scroll a button to adjust the 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.830
 of p 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:52.250
 and the two usual buttons right and 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.470
 left between your specifications 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.630
 we will find up to 3200 cpi thanks to 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.960
 optical sensor that also incorporates 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.850
 suppose 20000 hertz thanks to the button 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.200
 of pay we can adjust a the fly the 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:10.290
 sensitivity between 400 800 1,600 and 3,200 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.640
 in each mode will be identified by a 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:14.980
 different color 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.870
 and if we talk about mk one what we most 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.420
 has been surprised has been his software but 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.760
 of this we will talk later account 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.680
 with a sober design without shrillness in 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.690
 a rigorous black color where only 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.800
 highlights the word most illuminated in red 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.660
 in the part of the overflowing dolls 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.070
 in its lower part we will find the 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.630
 possibility of raising the height of the 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:36.360
 keyboard 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:39.840
 lm as one enters Cable 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.970
 Mesh and gold plated connector 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.250
 apart from the usual keys all 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.690
 they membrane has 20 keys 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.670
 multimedia that will allow us a better 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.510
 control of this type of tasks a 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.670
 fast and dynamic way 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.930
 as we have previously commented its 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.599
 strong point is the software that 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.519
 incorporates with this we can define 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:00.920
 any type of function for each one 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.659
 of its keys we can also store 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.939
 the up to three different profiles 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:06.939
 all a pleasant surprise on this keyboard 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.069
 then we were pleasantly surprised 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.250
 with two peripherals that will offer you 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:16.050
 much more than you expect 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.630
 if you are looking for a keyboard and a mouse 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.820
 to start in the gamer world these 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.500
 may be your choice maybe we have 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.320
 missed macro functions for the 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.690
 m1 and some specific key for this 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.790
 in mk 1 but if we consider the 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.819
 price of both peripherals little more 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.709
 we can ask the tacens guys 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:36.390
 are already available on our website for 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.840
 your purchase you have the links in the 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.840
