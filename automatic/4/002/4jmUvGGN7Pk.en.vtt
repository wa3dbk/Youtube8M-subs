00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
about sublimation vinyl so we're going

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.820 
about sublimation vinyl so we're going
to<00:00:14.400> run<00:00:14.670> through<00:00:15.030> what<00:00:15.960> it<00:00:16.080> is<00:00:16.289> and<00:00:16.590> what<00:00:16.740> it

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
to run through what it is and what it

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.250

can achieve and how to do it very
quickly<00:00:20.960> so<00:00:22.100> we<00:00:23.100> have<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:24.119> picture<00:00:24.900> of<00:00:25.260> of<00:00:26.390> our

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
quickly so we have a picture of of our

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.620 
quickly so we have a picture of of our
company<00:00:27.840> logo<00:00:27.869> here

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:29.630 
company logo here

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:36.110 
company logo here
now<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:33.829> gray<00:00:34.829> contour<00:00:35.489> line<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.910> black

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
now the gray contour line the black

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.030 
now the gray contour line the black
contour<00:00:36.570> line<00:00:36.870> is<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:38.129> size<00:00:38.399> of<00:00:38.700> my<00:00:38.760> prints

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.040 
contour line is the size of my prints

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.290 
contour line is the size of my prints
what<00:00:41.040> we've<00:00:41.250> done<00:00:41.610> is<00:00:42.230> made<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.410> background

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
what we've done is made the background

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.340 
what we've done is made the background
slightly<00:00:45.300> bigger<00:00:46.280> so<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:47.309> when<00:00:47.760> we<00:00:47.940> cut<00:00:48.350> this

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
slightly bigger so that when we cut this

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.770 
slightly bigger so that when we cut this
contour<00:00:49.980> line<00:00:50.809> the<00:00:51.809> print<00:00:52.550> will<00:00:53.550> go<00:00:53.850> over<00:00:54.539> in

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
contour line the print will go over in

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.330 
contour line the print will go over in
all<00:00:55.050> directions<00:00:56.149> the<00:00:57.149> actual<00:00:58.079> cut<00:00:58.440> piece<00:00:59.129> of

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
all directions the actual cut piece of

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.299 
all directions the actual cut piece of
vinyl<00:01:00.230> which<00:01:01.230> means<00:01:01.559> will<00:01:01.770> not<00:01:01.980> have<00:01:02.100> any

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
vinyl which means will not have any

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.359 
vinyl which means will not have any
white<00:01:02.579> edges<00:01:03.149> anywhere<00:01:03.899> around<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:04.860> it'll

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
white edges anywhere around it and it'll

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.010 
white edges anywhere around it and it'll
line<00:01:05.729> up<00:01:06.000> really<00:01:06.450> nice<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.080> smooth<00:01:08.210> okay<00:01:09.210> so

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.730 
print is the bigger blue with the face
inside<00:01:31.009> to<00:01:32.009> ensure<00:01:32.430> it<00:01:33.329> goes<00:01:33.659> over<00:01:33.960> the

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
inside to ensure it goes over the

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:42.520 
inside to ensure it goes over the
contour<00:01:35.220> cut

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:49.270

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
this too much right just overlaid and

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.149 
this too much right just overlaid and
tape<00:04:04.769> down<00:04:05.099> now<00:04:06.060> what<00:04:06.269> I<00:04:06.409> use<00:04:07.409> to<00:04:07.440> make<00:04:07.980> sure

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:08.159 
tape down now what I use to make sure

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:14.930
