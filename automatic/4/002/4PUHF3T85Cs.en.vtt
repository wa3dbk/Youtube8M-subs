the blue ocean they oddly really relate
well<00:03:37.690> together<00:03:38.200> and<00:03:38.739> I<00:03:39.130> like<00:03:39.700> the<00:03:39.910> idea<00:03:40.209> of

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
well together and I like the idea of

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:41.699 
well together and I like the idea of
that<00:03:40.480> this<00:03:40.660> room<00:03:40.870> even<00:03:41.170> though<00:03:41.260> it<00:03:41.380> has<00:03:41.560> an

that this room even though it has an
ethnic<00:03:42.130> Flair<00:03:42.430> it<00:03:43.060> can<00:03:43.540> still<00:03:43.870> be<00:03:44.760> American

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
ethnic Flair it can still be American

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.460 
ethnic Flair it can still be American
feeling<00:03:46.239> and<00:03:46.480> waited<00:03:46.810> because<00:03:47.080> what<00:03:47.290> is<00:03:47.440> more

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
feeling and waited because what is more

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.500 
feeling and waited because what is more
American<00:03:47.860> than<00:03:48.070> the<00:03:48.400> color<00:03:48.790> scheme<00:03:49.090> red<00:03:49.299> white

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510

and<00:03:49.690> blue<00:03:49.900> and<00:03:50.200> that's<00:03:50.860> what<00:03:51.070> we<00:03:51.190> basically

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
and blue and that's what we basically

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.430 
and blue and that's what we basically
have<00:03:51.700> here<00:03:52.060> in<00:03:52.209> a<00:03:52.299> really<00:03:52.690> chic<00:03:53.200> sophisticated

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440
