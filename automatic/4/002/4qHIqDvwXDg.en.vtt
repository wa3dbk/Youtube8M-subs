00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:05.680
 good friends today I will teach you how 

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:07.299
 try an oil pressure powder in 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.280
 our vehicle we always have the 

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:10.570
 witnesses who tell us about the 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.180
 operation condition of our 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.519
 vehicle these witnesses are understood to 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:18.910
 connect the switch some understand 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:21.160
 momentarily and others stay 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:24.640
 on until the engine starts to 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.720
 work these little lights or witnesses like 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.850
 they want to call 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.190
 they light to indicate that the 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.470
 system is working correctly or 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:35.440
 the alert system is in 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.570
 good performance if any of these 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.550
 witnesses does not turn on is indicating us 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:43.450
 that there is some problem with some sensor 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:46.090
 some bulb or some electric harness 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:48.430
 has been disconnected in the case of 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:51.399
 volkswagen sedan of new indicators 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:55.430
 of oil pressure and the system 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:58.010
 load as we can see in the video 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.320
 the oil pressure indicator no no 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.840
 is working what is it tells us 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.600
 that we have some problem that can 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.030
 because the bulb is fused 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:11.540
 that the cable has been disconnected from 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:14.390
 oil pressure bulb or that the bulo 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.830
 of oil pressure no longer serves right now 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.180
 what we are going to do a test to 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.520
 I return from oil pressure to 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.940
 check if it's working or no longer 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.940
 it serves 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.149
 good friends, we already have here 

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:31.220
 our oil pressure group is 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:33.760
 find down the distributor as 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.980
 we can see stools 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.540
 the cable is connected so 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.180
 we can say that it is not the problem is 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:43.090
 Now what we are going to do is proceed 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:46.450
 to do a test to check if the 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:49.860
 bulb is working and what are we going to 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.860
 do is disconnect the cable 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.700
 and we're going to land it to a part of 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.250
 earth of the engine I in this I am going to 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.990
 put in this good part well since 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.270
 We have the cable counted ashore 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.990
 hostile 'is this calm only for 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.720
 hold the small cable and this alligator 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.820
 is from a test lamp or from a 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.390
 current tester nothing else what 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.550
 use to 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.890
 to put cable that does not move anymore 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:21.490
 a good contact with earth now as 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.560
 you proceed to learn the suites and if the 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.990
 foquito comes to learn that means 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.290
 that what serves us is the bulb of 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:32.170
 oil pressure and it turns on means 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:34.300
 that the bulb is good, good that 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.020
 we are inside the vehicle and we are going to 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.700
 learn to proceed to turn on the switch 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:42.459
 and if the foquito learns it means that 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.790
 our oil pressure bulb no longer 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.790
 it serves 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.790
 as we can observe and learned that 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.400
 means that what serves us is the 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.409
 oil pressure bulb 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.120
 in case the little bit had 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:57.939
 On means that our groups 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.000
 of oil pressure if it is working 

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:01.830
 correctly 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.240
 so now what are we going to proceed to 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.090
 make is the change of our 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.850
 Oil pressure play is very easy 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:14.490
 to change it I'm going to use a key 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:17.280
 of this type this measure 15-16 only 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:19.530
 loosen it take it out put the new and 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.460
 connect it that's all very simple in 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.380
 installation 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:26.110
 Well, here we already have both 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:29.500
 oil pressure eggs this be the 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:32.170
 used the one that no longer serves what we get 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.740
 and this is the new one that we're going to 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:38.070
 proceed to climb 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:40.920
 have only been urged at the time of 

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:43.250
 tighten only with such the cable that 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.250
 we have 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:26.550
 now we only proceed to connect 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:29.680
 the wire 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:32.590
 has placed this little 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.900
 goals to protect them from water and 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:37.620
 cosmos 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:40.710
 and now if it's already ready, suppose 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:43.110
 that now you have to turn on the 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.290
 the witness let's proceed to do the 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.290
 test 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.940
 ah 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:03.370
 as we can see and lit now to 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:06.430
 turn on the engine is the witness you have 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:09.150
 what to turn off so that it shows us that it's 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:09.150
 working correctly
