00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:16.950
 there are animals 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.540
 frightened and surprised are found 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.119
 the settlers of the colony the 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:23.820
 hope new guinea when observing that 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.070
 a sow gave birth to 10 hooks and two 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.710
 their pups brought double text what 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.910
 they argue that they are living the 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.910
 last times 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.539
 that they are not normal like 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.949
 others because this has one of them 

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:45.840
 has has male pig and also 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:49.080
 has this female 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:53.580
 then he has both texts and the other 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:55.380
 is that the nails are like degas together 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.420
 cats 6 like cat's claw to the 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.370
 onion of a cat and nothing easy are 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.629
 written in the Bible every day 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:06.990
 we will see more or more terrible things 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.550
 So that makes us think that the 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.470
 things their professions are 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.270
 fulfilling on our part we look for the 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.580
 Professional version of a veterinarian 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.010
 so that it will give us an orientation 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.619
 about the malformation of the 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:22.649
 curritos and this was what he told us 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.479
 Thank you, I'm the doctor 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:27.420
 veterinarian pablo antonio espinoza 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.580
 airbag from here in new line inside 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.770
 my knowledge as a doctor this 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.440
 problem that we claim truth 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.630
 It can be presented in different 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.690
 species true in this case then in 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.930
 pig these are hermaphroditic animals 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:45.330
 truth the problem is a mutation these 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.789
 mutations are given within the material 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.620
 genetic of the cell true this inside 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:51.570
 of the DNA would be 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.490
 and as I told you, it can be presented in 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.300
 different species very common in 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:00.480
 equines in pigs and canines as the 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.580
 mortality of these animals when alone 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.800
 they are hermaphroditic animals the only 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.750
 problem that we have true is 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.550
 that are not suitable for reproduction are 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.280
 can present us in some cases 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.260
 present vulvas present testicles 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.600
 could present a testicle could 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.460
 present a vulva truth then not 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.950
 are suitable for reproduction because 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.320
 what happens to your reproductive organ does not 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.510
 it's so developed there are internal organs 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.940
 that atrophy do not develop then 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.920
 has no reproductive life after 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.200
 animal follows a normal life course 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.300
 but it should be destined to 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.370
 Ardaya sacrifice when it reaches a 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.500
 adult life from new guinea les 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:41.120
