00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.310
 hey people and welcome to mikes 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.540
 suite today three times the corn 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:10.250
 The most asked questions always ask me 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.250
 theme magic lantern 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:19.700
 how can i use blind and delete from 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.020
 magic lantern is actually quite 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:25.550
 just card out 10 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.099
 deleted economy 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.840
 Of course there is still a way with it 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:31.160
 to get it really clean from the system 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.270
 can delete completely 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.640
 I will again in one 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.180
 separate tutorial certificates are included 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.150
 a bit longer 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.830
 but basically taken around which countries 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.140
 to remove full camera 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.390
 it is enough to remove the card or 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.489
 just format the card 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.170
 together with magic lantern and not with 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.239
 climb it be on or before the pc 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:54.020
 assemble filled clots the 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:56.719
 sprinterin lose the annoying topic 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.270
 with the guarantee &amp; magic lantern as is 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:01.070
 Now it is fact , according to Canon is the 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.590
 installation of third party manufacturers 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.500
 Software completely banned and leads 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.149
 it is also a loss of warranty 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.970
 but also so that there are no known ones 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:12.560
 cases where magic lantern gives a camera 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.630
 has completely shot and then 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.910
 no longer went 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.979
 it's just a matter on your own 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.709
 So neither I nor risk installs risk 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.899
 still know the guys of magic lantern 

00:01:21.709 --> 00:01:26.060
 accept any warranty in that 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:27.979
 But it's just that way 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.399
 Surely it can be in the park or something 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.990
 if he is a shield is probably on it 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:35.630
 enter on snow and smoothen forbidden 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.670
 this secures the city if you 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.349
 there goes in the park and out of rust and 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.179
 you break what then you can the city 

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:44.209
 Do not sue because you have the sign 

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:46.429
 Nevertheless, people have gone there 

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:49.580
 Even in the winter in the park and slip 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:51.410
 also not out so that's just that 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.200
 same if you lantern magic 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.970
 installed secures itself to recognize 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.580
 so that they do not take over anything 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.429
 if there was something should happen 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.200
 which was not the case so far but in 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:04.759
 The rule actually happens as well as 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.200
 nothing at all with magic lantern 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:07.550
 i have with clinton on one 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.050
 memory card but I have only one 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.180
 second memory card what am I doing 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.010
 then very simple answer copy 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.440
 just open the magic lantern files 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.180
 every single memory card voodoo too 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.220
 if the capsules want it on 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.300
 I did that for example like that 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.280
 have magic lantern on one 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.600
 memory card installed then I have 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.520
 all settings on the k 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.620
 made the way I would like to have the 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.080
 because the attitude will be in 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.130
 its a file with purely stored 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.540
 on the memory card 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.670
 then I have the memory card 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.800
 pulled out in the computer on the 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.390
 computer then I have the files from 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.070
 the memory card on the computer 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.860
 Drawn like a folder created for it 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:46.280
 and then on all memory cards this 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.930
 Folder copied or the magic lantern 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.420
 files needed for this 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.370
 so I have on all memory cards 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.480
 and I think so 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.550
 345 I have no idea I feel 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.980
 always the same magic lantern 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.290
 attitudes and need not worry 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.300
 that something in the system in magic 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.250
 lantern your menu is or is 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.590
