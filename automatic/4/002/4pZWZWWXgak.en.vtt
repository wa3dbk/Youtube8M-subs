00:00:01.349 --> 00:00:04.160
 with the eyes open 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.160
 work and the right to work 

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:18.310
 merkel 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.820
 one of the most important principles to have a reliable shot 

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:25.980
 is to make the shot from the bottom up 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.800
 so he took a parabola and went over the network 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.829
 I was going to people from the bottom line 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:35.789
 I looked first for his racket to be always below the height of the 

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:38.160
 balls this way 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.630
 and so you force the racket held by the ball that I climb for it 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:45.630
 to quote the parable you are looking for 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.320
 if we analyze the rights of roller federer and yelena yancovich you will see that 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.560
 they claim to always be below the height of the ball 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.350
 they were going to climb 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.350
 so that his ball takes the parable that we have already mentioned 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.570
 this play is analyzed yelena yanukÃ³vich takes a low ball 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:08.060
 but she is sure that her racket is one hundred below the height of 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.070
 the ball 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.460
 inclusive already flexes 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.000
 then the racket goes up 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.660
 so that the ball took a parabola pass over the network 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.210
 cybage before the baseline 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.940
 screen some of the best tennis players of all history said 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.200
 buscats silva and at least 50 centimeters above the grid and 50 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.470
 centimeters within the line of the court 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.010
 he was one of the best in all of history and one of the players that 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.390
 less 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.190
 In addition to climbing the ball you must keep your wrist closed 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.030
 what do I mean with closed from keeping your wrist this way 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.440
 although his waltz 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.020
 you're going to keep the doll closed all the time in this way 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.830
 if at any time it opens 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.980
 the ball saves will not take the parable we are looking for 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.990
 all the time 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.360
 if we observe in this video the right of millennial cubic 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.819
 that she is below the height of the waves 

00:02:12.529 --> 00:02:15.529
 but throughout the turn she keeps the wrist closed 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:20.959
 it does so for the ball to take the effect is the parable we want for 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:22.269
 over the network 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:25.679
 and before the coastline 

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:28.899
 to better understand this topic in attending the closed wrist 

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:31.389
 the quadern very simple example 

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:34.879
 imagine that his racket is a brush they were going to paint a wall 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.420
 imagine that all the face all the strings in all the 

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:41.949
 it's the morocha 

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:44.139
 how we want to paint it 

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:48.099
 let's do let's paint this way if we at any time 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:50.309
 of the shot we turn it 

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:51.899
 he is not going to paint 

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:55.289
 then always seek to maintain disproportion 

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:56.469
 obviously 

00:02:56.469 --> 00:02:57.979
 the shot has 

00:02:57.979 --> 00:03:00.759
 a forward and upward movement 

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:03.759
 then we will follow a path 

00:03:04.279 --> 00:03:06.799
 up and forward diagonally 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:08.209
 in this way 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.289
 but always remember 

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:12.529
 keep her dolls 

00:03:12.529 --> 00:03:14.319
 remember to always keep 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:17.349
 which is below the height of the ball 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:20.349
 climb up it and keep your doll close 

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:23.809
 in this way you will have a much more reliable shot 

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:28.839
 remember practice makes the master see you on the court no
