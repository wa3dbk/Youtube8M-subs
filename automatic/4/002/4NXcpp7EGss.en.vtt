00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:13.559
 Hello everyone today will prepare you a pasta 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:17.970
 really spent life just picked up a 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:21.390
 manettin of organic rocket grown 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.900
 on my terrace and so we will prepare a 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.210
 very tasty rocket pesto and at the end 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.420
 we'll add the ricotta first thing 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:33.090
 we have the rocket carefully 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.420
 drain and we travel on a 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.420
 carroccio 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.340
 meanwhile lay one on the fire 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.230
 pot with salt water 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.230
 when the rocket is completely 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:50.570
 dry we leave it in the bowl 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:57.239
 adding the almonds and pine nuts 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:01:02.309
 grated pecorino oil parmesan cheese 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:09.600
 extra virgin olive oil and I mentioned the 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:12.140
 low speed mixer wounds more weight 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.340
 grainy I recommend you mix 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.690
 only for 10 seconds 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.460
 otherwise keep mixing 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.460
 increasing speed for five more 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.190
 seconds here is finally our text 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.619
 it is ready with a grainy consistency 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:32.039
 I did not add proof as I like it 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.289
 salt because the cheeses we have 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:38.780
 added are already salty in itself 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:38.780
 given the time to drop the pasta 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:44.160
 let 's go back to the pasta al dente e 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:46.979
 line a large container for 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.440
 season it, add the rocket text 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.410
 and finally the ricotta and mix 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.899
 institutes and here is how or plate to the 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:57.709
 vermicelli with the test of lucano e 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.709
 ricotta cheese 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:05.490
 the text can also be stored in 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:10.920
 fridge in a glass jar 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:14.250
 hermetically sealed or frozen 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:17.610
 meanwhile I leave you my greetings and you 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:20.120
