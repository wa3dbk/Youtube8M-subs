00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:24.380 
the magnitude of Virtua 2009 it's pretty
unbelievable<00:00:23.400> so<00:00:24.029> we're<00:00:24.150> going<00:00:24.270> to<00:00:24.360> start

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:54.910 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:56.970 

so<00:00:55.390> out<00:00:55.540> here<00:00:55.780> is<00:00:55.900> the<00:00:55.989> outskirts<00:00:56.560> this<00:00:56.800> is<00:00:56.950> a

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:56.980 
so out here is the outskirts this is a

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.740 
so out here is the outskirts this is a
fight<00:00:57.489> as<00:00:57.579> far<00:00:57.820> as<00:00:57.940> away<00:00:58.150> from<00:00:58.450> the<00:00:58.570> main

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
fight as far as away from the main

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.479 
fight as far as away from the main
flight<00:00:59.170> line<00:00:59.410> as<00:00:59.560> you<00:00:59.650> can<00:00:59.800> get<00:01:00.010> they<00:01:00.220> still

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
flight line as you can get they still

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:01.680 
flight line as you can get they still
have<00:01:00.640> flight<00:01:00.880> lines<00:01:01.090> all<00:01:01.300> the<00:01:01.330> way<00:01:01.450> to<00:01:01.540> the

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
have flight lines all the way to the

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.690 
have flight lines all the way to the
right<00:01:01.720> over<00:01:02.080> here<00:01:02.230> you<00:01:02.380> can<00:01:02.530> see<00:01:02.739> guys<00:01:03.489> are

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
flying I think there's about 15 to 17

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.070 
flying I think there's about 15 to 17
plate<00:01:06.790> stations<00:01:07.270> and<00:01:07.450> these<00:01:07.690> are<00:01:07.840> all<00:01:07.960> the

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
plate stations and these are all the

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.940 
plate stations and these are all the
pitch<00:01:08.260> starting<00:01:08.710> out<00:01:08.830> over<00:01:09.070> here

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.440 

just<00:01:12.549> a<00:01:12.700> magnitude<00:01:13.539> that<00:01:13.780> kind<00:01:14.049> of<00:01:14.140> manage

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
just a magnitude that kind of manage

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.520 
just a magnitude that kind of manage

pilots that are here for the show you

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:53.309 
pilots that are here for the show you
have<00:01:51.880> an<00:01:51.939> idea<00:01:52.179> with<00:01:52.360> registration<00:01:53.079> is<00:01:53.170> right

00:01:53.309 --> 00:01:53.319 
have an idea with registration is right

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:55.260 
have an idea with registration is right
now<00:01:53.470> Steve<00:01:53.740> you<00:01:53.890> at<00:01:54.310> this<00:01:54.819> point<00:01:55.119> I<00:01:55.209> no

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
now Steve you at this point I no

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.080 
now Steve you at this point I no
pre-registration<00:01:55.720> was<00:01:56.459> 570<00:01:57.459> something<00:01:57.880> and

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
pre-registration was 570 something and

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.580 
pre-registration was 570 something and
they<00:01:58.659> probably<00:01:58.869> picked<00:01:59.140> up<00:01:59.200> a<00:01:59.319> few<00:01:59.470> hundred

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
they probably picked up a few hundred

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:00.719 
they probably picked up a few hundred
from<00:01:59.860> there<00:02:00.009> so<00:02:00.130> we're<00:02:00.280> looking<00:02:00.369> at<00:02:00.549> probably

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
from there so we're looking at probably

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.139 
from there so we're looking at probably
600<00:02:01.270> 700<00:02:01.689> pilots<00:02:01.959> already<00:02:02.789> so<00:02:03.789> we're<00:02:03.939> going<00:02:04.060> to

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
600 700 pilots already so we're going to

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:05.569 
600 700 pilots already so we're going to
be<00:02:04.239> looking<00:02:04.360> at<00:02:04.569> a<00:02:04.599> big<00:02:04.780> show<00:02:05.020> this<00:02:05.200> year

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
be looking at a big show this year

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.490 
be looking at a big show this year
Bernie<00:02:06.579> bug<00:02:06.909> yeah<00:02:07.539> we're<00:02:07.780> going<00:02:07.899> to<00:02:07.959> turn<00:02:08.289> in

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
Bernie bug yeah we're going to turn in

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.850 
Bernie bug yeah we're going to turn in
and<00:02:08.679> get<00:02:08.829> inside<00:02:09.250> here<00:02:09.670> in<00:02:10.119> a<00:02:10.239> second<00:02:10.860> this

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
and get inside here in a second this

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.130 
and get inside here in a second this
starts<00:02:12.160> to<00:02:12.220> double<00:02:12.610> roll<00:02:12.790> double<00:02:13.569> grow<00:02:13.810> up

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
starts to double roll double grow up

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.210 
starts to double roll double grow up
here<00:02:14.380> I<00:02:16.350> think<00:02:17.350> we<00:02:17.440> can<00:02:17.590> make<00:02:17.709> a<00:02:17.769> cut<00:02:18.040> right

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
here I think we can make a cut right

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.190 
here I think we can make a cut right
there<00:02:18.280> always<00:02:18.639> yep<00:02:19.269> there's<00:02:19.660> a<00:02:19.750> little<00:02:19.959> cart

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
there always yep there's a little cart

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.780 
there always yep there's a little cart
