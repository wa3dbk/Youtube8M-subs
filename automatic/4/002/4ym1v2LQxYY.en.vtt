right<00:01:46.090> when<00:01:46.240> you<00:01:46.329> jump<00:01:46.360> on<00:01:46.750> like<00:01:47.170> you<00:01:47.619> want<00:01:47.770> to

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
right when you jump on like you want to

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.069 
right when you jump on like you want to
jump<00:01:48.039> the<00:01:48.130> jumps<00:01:48.579> first<00:01:49.119> slap<00:01:49.390> everything

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:50.079 
jump the jumps first slap everything

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:52.350 
jump the jumps first slap everything
just<00:01:50.259> feels<00:01:50.590> on<00:01:51.159> point<00:01:51.579> as<00:01:51.849> far<00:01:52.060> as<00:01:52.149> where<00:01:52.299> the

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
just feels on point as far as where the

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.600 
just feels on point as far as where the
bar<00:01:52.630> position<00:01:53.140> is<00:01:53.289> and<00:01:53.530> the<00:01:53.860> foot<00:01:54.130> pegs<00:01:54.399> where

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
bar position is and the foot pegs where

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:55.710 
bar position is and the foot pegs where
those<00:01:54.729> are<00:01:54.909> I<00:01:54.939> think<00:01:55.090> they<00:01:55.270> move<00:01:55.420> in<00:01:55.539> a<00:01:55.599> couple

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
those are I think they move in a couple

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.569 
those are I think they move in a couple
millimeters<00:01:56.110> back<00:01:56.619> this<00:01:56.950> really<00:01:57.099> made<00:01:57.459> you

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:57.579 
millimeters back this really made you

00:01:57.579 --> 00:01:58.740 
millimeters back this really made you
have<00:01:57.729> a<00:01:57.759> stable<00:01:58.060> feeling<00:01:58.539> through<00:01:58.659> the

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 
have a stable feeling through the

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.899 
have a stable feeling through the
corners<00:01:59.170> it<00:01:59.860> control<00:02:00.280> the<00:02:00.399> bike<00:02:00.610> and<00:02:00.759> it's

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 
corners it control the bike and it's

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:03.270 
corners it control the bike and it's
super<00:02:01.270> stable<00:02:01.509> the<00:02:02.140> 50<00:02:02.530> just<00:02:02.739> kind<00:02:02.920> of<00:02:02.950> felt<00:02:03.159> it

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
super stable the 50 just kind of felt it

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.889 
super stable the 50 just kind of felt it
had<00:02:03.340> kind<00:02:03.549> of<00:02:03.670> an<00:02:03.789> awkward<00:02:03.970> feeling<00:02:04.659> so<00:02:04.869> I

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
had kind of an awkward feeling so I

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:07.889 
had kind of an awkward feeling so I
think<00:02:05.020> they<00:02:05.259> really<00:02:05.640> fix<00:02:06.640> those<00:02:06.819> changes<00:02:07.329> for

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 
think they really fix those changes for

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:09.589 
think they really fix those changes for
the<00:02:08.049> better<00:02:08.079> and<00:02:08.470> resolve<00:02:09.039> those<00:02:09.220> problems

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
the better and resolve those problems

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.630 
the better and resolve those problems
also<00:02:10.599> with<00:02:10.780> the<00:02:10.899> new<00:02:10.929> foot<00:02:11.470> pegs<00:02:11.739> and<00:02:12.160> the<00:02:12.220> new

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
also with the new foot pegs and the new

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.990 
also with the new foot pegs and the new
shifter<00:02:13.120> tip<00:02:13.360> there<00:02:14.230> are<00:02:14.650> self-cleaning<00:02:15.190> so

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
shifter tip there are self-cleaning so

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.309 
shifter tip there are self-cleaning so
there's<00:02:16.239> before<00:02:16.720> them<00:02:16.870> you<00:02:16.989> get<00:02:17.079> in<00:02:17.230> the

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
there's before them you get in the

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.740 
there's before them you get in the
corner<00:02:17.500> you<00:02:17.709> get<00:02:17.769> really<00:02:18.069> low<00:02:18.340> dirt<00:02:19.329> sometimes

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
corner you get really low dirt sometimes

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.300 
corner you get really low dirt sometimes
get<00:02:19.930> stuck<00:02:20.140> up<00:02:20.440> in<00:02:20.560> there<00:02:20.739> and<00:02:20.829> puts<00:02:21.069> them<00:02:21.190> up

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
get stuck up in there and puts them up

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.160 
get stuck up in there and puts them up
like<00:02:21.489> this<00:02:21.700> so<00:02:22.299> now<00:02:22.450> every<00:02:22.690> time<00:02:22.780> you<00:02:22.900> get<00:02:23.019> into

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
like this so now every time you get into

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.170 
like this so now every time you get into
a<00:02:23.230> corner<00:02:23.560> it's<00:02:23.769> self<00:02:24.069> cleans<00:02:24.340> itself<00:02:24.730> so<00:02:25.030> if

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
a corner it's self cleans itself so if

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.640 
a corner it's self cleans itself so if
that<00:02:25.299> never<00:02:25.510> happened<00:02:26.019> it's<00:02:26.139> same<00:02:26.319> with<00:02:26.350> the

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
that never happened it's same with the

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.069 
that never happened it's same with the
shifter<00:02:27.459> tip<00:02:27.670> also<00:02:28.060> in<00:02:28.450> the<00:02:28.600> past<00:02:28.840> couple

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:29.079 
shifter tip also in the past couple

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:30.900 
shifter tip also in the past couple
years<00:02:29.260> Honda<00:02:29.889> has<00:02:30.010> been<00:02:30.130> really<00:02:30.400> big<00:02:30.579> on<00:02:30.730> mass

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
years Honda has been really big on mass

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.640 
years Honda has been really big on mass
centralization

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
centralization

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.530 
centralization
and<00:02:33.040> we<00:02:33.459> really<00:02:33.700> didn't<00:02:33.970> really<00:02:34.180> grasp<00:02:34.450> that

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
and we really didn't really grasp that

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.059 
and we really didn't really grasp that
concept<00:02:34.690> too<00:02:35.200> well<00:02:35.410> with<00:02:35.560> the<00:02:35.650> bike<00:02:35.800> we<00:02:35.950> knew

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
concept too well with the bike we knew

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:38.640 
concept too well with the bike we knew
was<00:02:36.250> really<00:02:36.520> nimble<00:02:36.670> but<00:02:37.480> KTM<00:02:37.959> really<00:02:38.410> upped

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
was really nimble but KTM really upped

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:39.990 
was really nimble but KTM really upped
that<00:02:38.860> tried<00:02:39.160> to<00:02:39.190> move<00:02:39.280> everything<00:02:39.610> towards

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
that tried to move everything towards

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.760 
that tried to move everything towards
the<00:02:40.060> center<00:02:40.330> of<00:02:40.390> the<00:02:40.480> bike<00:02:40.630> and<00:02:41.380> it's<00:02:41.620> almost

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
the center of the bike and it's almost

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:42.900 
the center of the bike and it's almost
kind<00:02:41.980> of<00:02:42.099> weird<00:02:42.310> it<00:02:42.400> almost<00:02:42.520> feels<00:02:42.760> like<00:02:42.790> a

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
kind of weird it almost feels like a

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.580 
kind of weird it almost feels like a
two-stroke<00:02:43.420> in<00:02:43.569> a<00:02:43.630> way<00:02:43.780> because<00:02:44.319> it<00:02:44.440> feels

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
two-stroke in a way because it feels

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.680 
two-stroke in a way because it feels
really<00:02:44.770> light<00:02:45.099> nimble<00:02:45.400> and<00:02:45.730> also<00:02:46.420> when<00:02:46.540> you're

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
really light nimble and also when you're

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.420 
really light nimble and also when you're
when<00:02:46.840> you're<00:02:46.870> maneuvering<00:02:47.590> it<00:02:47.739> it<00:02:48.160> kind<00:02:48.400> of

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
when you're maneuvering it it kind of

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:49.770 
when you're maneuvering it it kind of
goes<00:02:48.610> where<00:02:48.849> you<00:02:48.910> want<00:02:49.120> to<00:02:49.300> go<00:02:49.450> it's<00:02:49.660> almost

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
goes where you want to go it's almost

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.570 
goes where you want to go it's almost
hard<00:02:50.050> to<00:02:50.110> bring<00:02:50.349> it<00:02:50.470> back<00:02:50.650> when<00:02:51.220> you<00:02:51.280> have<00:02:51.430> more

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
hard to bring it back when you have more

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.729 
hard to bring it back when you have more
mess<00:02:51.849> mass<00:02:52.180> outside<00:02:52.750> of<00:02:52.900> it<00:02:52.989> it's<00:02:53.170> kind<00:02:53.680> of

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
mess mass outside of it it's kind of

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:55.710 
mess mass outside of it it's kind of
more<00:02:53.860> wobbly<00:02:54.160> feeling<00:02:54.730> so<00:02:55.030> now<00:02:55.150> it's<00:02:55.300> way<00:02:55.480> more

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
more wobbly feeling so now it's way more

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.020 
more wobbly feeling so now it's way more

to<00:03:00.519> say<00:03:00.670> I'm<00:03:00.760> super<00:03:01.150> happy<00:03:01.269> it<00:03:01.900> was<00:03:02.050> really

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
to say I'm super happy it was really

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:03.990 
to say I'm super happy it was really
something<00:03:02.560> that's<00:03:02.860> been<00:03:03.040> a<00:03:03.069> long<00:03:03.340> time<00:03:03.580> coming

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
something that's been a long time coming

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.850 
something that's been a long time coming
from<00:03:04.120> this<00:03:04.269> bike<00:03:04.480> to<00:03:04.630> be<00:03:04.750> changed<00:03:05.200> and<00:03:05.470> they

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
from this bike to be changed and they

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.039 
from this bike to be changed and they
made<00:03:06.069> a<00:03:06.310> lot<00:03:06.730> of<00:03:06.760> revisions<00:03:07.269> there's<00:03:07.780> still<00:03:08.019> a

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
made a lot of revisions there's still a

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:09.960 
made a lot of revisions there's still a
few<00:03:08.350> hiccups<00:03:08.560> that<00:03:08.799> I<00:03:08.920> think<00:03:09.160> we<00:03:09.250> can<00:03:09.430> we<00:03:09.819> can

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
few hiccups that I think we can we can

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.220 
few hiccups that I think we can we can
kind<00:03:10.150> of<00:03:10.209> tweak<00:03:10.360> a<00:03:10.510> little<00:03:10.720> bit<00:03:10.840> with<00:03:10.989> with

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
kind of tweak a little bit with with

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.650 
kind of tweak a little bit with with
gearing<00:03:11.769> and<00:03:11.920> some<00:03:12.100> suspension<00:03:12.519> but<00:03:13.360> overall

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
gearing and some suspension but overall

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.289 
gearing and some suspension but overall
this<00:03:14.019> really<00:03:14.319> took<00:03:14.500> what<00:03:15.310> was<00:03:15.489> last<00:03:15.940> in<00:03:16.209> the

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:16.299 
this really took what was last in the

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:25.600 
this really took what was last in the
shootout<00:03:16.830> really<00:03:17.830> up<00:03:17.920> in<00:03:18.040> the<00:03:18.130> top<00:03:18.340> three

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.990 

so<00:03:26.210> the<00:03:26.810> power<00:03:27.020> on<00:03:27.320> the<00:03:27.700> 2015<00:03:28.700> and<00:03:28.850> a<00:03:28.880> half

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
so the power on the 2015 and a half

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.300 
so the power on the 2015 and a half
Dungey<00:03:29.420> edition<00:03:29.870> bike<00:03:30.050> it<00:03:30.740> feels<00:03:30.950> like<00:03:31.130> it's

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
Dungey edition bike it feels like it's

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.810 
Dungey edition bike it feels like it's
spread<00:03:32.270> out<00:03:32.300> a<00:03:32.480> lot<00:03:32.750> longer<00:03:33.340> it<00:03:34.340> fills<00:03:34.640> in<00:03:34.790> the

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
spread out a lot longer it fills in the

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.610 
spread out a lot longer it fills in the
gap<00:03:35.120> for<00:03:35.150> our<00:03:35.480> last<00:03:35.660> year's<00:03:35.900> bike<00:03:36.110> kinda<00:03:36.470> had<00:03:36.590> a

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
gap for our last year's bike kinda had a

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.860 
gap for our last year's bike kinda had a
little<00:03:36.920> bit<00:03:37.250> of<00:03:37.280> a<00:03:37.430> pop<00:03:37.640> and<00:03:38.150> then<00:03:38.300> a<00:03:38.330> dip<00:03:38.630> and

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
little bit of a pop and then a dip and

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.080 
little bit of a pop and then a dip and
then<00:03:39.110> it<00:03:39.230> read<00:03:39.380> back<00:03:39.590> out<00:03:39.830> this<00:03:40.580> bike<00:03:40.790> fills

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
then it read back out this bike fills

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.820 
then it read back out this bike fills
those<00:03:41.300> gaps<00:03:41.570> in<00:03:41.840> and<00:03:42.110> revs<00:03:42.350> a<00:03:42.500> little<00:03:42.710> bit

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
those gaps in and revs a little bit

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.190 
those gaps in and revs a little bit
farther<00:03:43.100> and<00:03:43.730> it<00:03:43.940> also<00:03:44.120> has<00:03:44.510> the<00:03:44.690> maps<00:03:44.900> which

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
farther and it also has the maps which

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.520 
farther and it also has the maps which
has<00:03:45.500> the<00:03:45.680> aggressive<00:03:46.100> map<00:03:46.310> on<00:03:46.490> number<00:03:46.760> two<00:03:46.940> and

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
has the aggressive map on number two and

because<00:04:34.460> the<00:04:34.639> bikes<00:04:34.820> so<00:04:35.030> much<00:04:35.210> lighter<00:04:35.570> that

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:36.139

that harshness in the middle has gone
away<00:04:38.479> on<00:04:38.780> the<00:04:38.930> forks<00:04:39.530> the<00:04:39.800> my<00:04:40.520> most<00:04:40.759> favorite

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
away on the forks the my most favorite

away on the forks the my most favorite
thing<00:04:41.270> about<00:04:41.300> the<00:04:41.630> bike<00:04:41.810> is<00:04:41.990> the<00:04:42.139> foot<00:04:42.320> pegs

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
thing about the bike is the foot pegs

thing about the bike is the foot pegs
the<00:04:43.250> foot<00:04:43.490> pegs<00:04:43.699> seem<00:04:43.940> like<00:04:44.120> they<00:04:44.570> pull<00:04:44.780> your

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
the foot pegs seem like they pull your

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.260 
the foot pegs seem like they pull your
feet<00:04:45.139> closer<00:04:45.470> into<00:04:45.949> the<00:04:45.979> frame<00:04:46.310> where<00:04:47.000> last

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
feet closer into the frame where last

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:48.730 
feet closer into the frame where last
year's<00:04:47.479> model<00:04:47.840> felt<00:04:48.050> like<00:04:48.169> my<00:04:48.350> feet<00:04:48.560> were<00:04:48.710> a

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
year's model felt like my feet were a

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.129 
year's model felt like my feet were a
little<00:04:49.009> bit<00:04:49.250> bowed<00:04:49.669> out<00:04:49.880> my<00:04:50.630> feet<00:04:50.870> feel<00:04:51.110> like

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:51.139 
little bit bowed out my feet feel like

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:52.779 
little bit bowed out my feet feel like
they're<00:04:51.470> pulled<00:04:51.680> in<00:04:51.860> so<00:04:52.070> I<00:04:52.130> can<00:04:52.310> squeeze<00:04:52.610> the

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:52.789 
they're pulled in so I can squeeze the

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:54.610 
they're pulled in so I can squeeze the
bike<00:04:52.970> better<00:04:53.210> with<00:04:53.449> my<00:04:53.600> legs<00:04:53.870> and<00:04:54.050> control<00:04:54.470> the

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:54.620 
bike better with my legs and control the

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.490 
bike better with my legs and control the
bike<00:04:54.770> with<00:04:54.979> my<00:04:55.130> hips<00:04:55.509> the<00:04:56.509> seat<00:04:56.780> is<00:04:56.990> nice<00:04:57.229> and

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
bike with my hips the seat is nice and

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.879 
bike with my hips the seat is nice and
flat<00:04:57.680> so<00:04:57.979> you<00:04:58.009> can<00:04:58.250> move<00:04:58.400> forward<00:04:58.639> or<00:04:58.970> back<00:04:59.150> and

flat so you can move forward or back and

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:02.950 
flat so you can move forward or back and
just<00:05:00.889> the<00:05:01.039> overall<00:05:01.400> package<00:05:01.639> from<00:05:02.030> the<00:05:02.090> foot

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
just the overall package from the foot

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.390 
just the overall package from the foot

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
pegs to the handlebar height that seems

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.850 
pegs to the handlebar height that seems
a<00:05:04.490> spot-on<00:05:05.479> so<00:05:05.840> the<00:05:06.199> gearing<00:05:06.410> on<00:05:06.620> the<00:05:06.740> bike

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
a spot-on so the gearing on the bike

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.180 
a spot-on so the gearing on the bike
comes<00:05:07.160> stock<00:05:07.430> with<00:05:07.669> a<00:05:07.699> 48<00:05:08.240> I<00:05:09.020> felt<00:05:09.800> like<00:05:09.949> it<00:05:10.099> was
