out where you want your planet's a

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.570 
out where you want your planet's a
pretty<00:01:55.580> decent<00:01:55.970> idea<00:01:56.300> and<00:01:57.220> say<00:01:58.220> that<00:01:58.430> we

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
pretty decent idea and say that we

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.870 
pretty decent idea and say that we

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
black shadow behind this one and then

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:26.630 
black shadow behind this one and then
say<00:02:20.930> we'll<00:02:21.110> make<00:02:21.260> this<00:02:21.470> the<00:02:21.530> biggest<00:02:21.920> one<00:02:22.340> and

spray it on my fingers I'm gonna start
putting<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.150> stars<00:03:24.420> in<00:03:35.450> there's<00:03:36.450> a<00:03:36.540> lot<00:03:36.720> of

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
putting the stars in there's a lot of

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.870 
putting the stars in there's a lot of
paint<00:03:37.049> on<00:03:37.200> here<00:03:37.410> so<00:03:37.530> it's<00:03:37.709> going<00:03:37.860> to<00:03:37.950> kind<00:03:38.730> of

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
paint on here so it's going to kind of

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.460 
paint on here so it's going to kind of
settle<00:03:39.150> in<00:03:39.390> any<00:03:39.599> way<00:03:42.049> it's<00:03:43.049> going<00:03:43.170> to<00:03:43.230> start

you can do is use this right here since

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:23.450

it<00:04:29.600> hold<00:04:30.600> it<00:04:30.780> like<00:04:31.550> so<00:04:32.550> I<00:04:32.580> think

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:05:05.650 

keep<00:04:42.960> fresh

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.659 

now<00:05:06.660> on<00:05:07.139> a<00:05:07.199> different<00:05:07.710> episode<00:05:07.830> I'm<00:05:08.400> going<00:05:08.490> to

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:08.669 
now on a different episode I'm going to

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:11.030 
now on a different episode I'm going to
light<00:05:08.820> one<00:05:09.000> of<00:05:09.090> these<00:05:09.210> on<00:05:09.389> fire<00:05:09.660> but<00:05:10.650> it's<00:05:10.889> not

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:11.040 
light one of these on fire but it's not

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.320 
light one of these on fire but it's not
going<00:05:11.160> to<00:05:11.250> be<00:05:11.340> this<00:05:11.520> one<00:05:11.699> because<00:05:11.910> we're<00:05:12.210> on

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
going to be this one because we're on

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:13.820 
going to be this one because we're on
cardboard<00:05:12.660> and<00:05:13.020> I'd<00:05:13.110> rather<00:05:13.350> have<00:05:13.560> something

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
cardboard and I'd rather have something

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.820 
cardboard and I'd rather have something
not<00:05:14.130> quite<00:05:14.280> so<00:05:14.550> flammable<00:05:14.850> I<00:05:15.740> think<00:05:16.740> this

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
not quite so flammable I think this

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.379 
not quite so flammable I think this
we're<00:05:17.070> going<00:05:17.190> to<00:05:17.250> call<00:05:17.460> it<00:05:17.490> quits<00:05:17.729> right<00:05:18.090> there

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:18.389 
we're going to call it quits right there

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:24.260 
we're going to call it quits right there
so<00:05:18.870> pick<00:05:19.169> this<00:05:19.350> up<00:05:19.590> pick<00:05:20.580> this<00:05:20.820> up<00:05:22.160> and<00:05:23.160> then<00:05:24.150> we

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
so pick this up pick this up and then we

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.580 
so pick this up pick this up and then we
can<00:05:24.479> pull<00:05:25.410> that<00:05:25.440> off<00:05:26.750> so<00:05:27.750> just<00:05:27.990> get<00:05:28.139> some<00:05:28.350> stuff

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
can pull that off so just get some stuff

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:30.500 
can pull that off so just get some stuff
out<00:05:28.770> and<00:05:28.979> practice<00:05:29.520> I'll<00:05:29.880> move<00:05:30.120> that<00:05:30.150> out<00:05:30.330> of

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510 
out and practice I'll move that out of

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:35.060 
out and practice I'll move that out of
there<00:05:30.690> in<00:05:30.840> a<00:05:30.870> few<00:05:31.020> minutes<00:05:33.560> as<00:05:34.560> you<00:05:34.680> can<00:05:34.830> see

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:35.070
