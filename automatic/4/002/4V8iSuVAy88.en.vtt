00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:37.570

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.850
 world 86 for for the honor to mexico 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.610
 and all Mexicans today we are going to do 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:04.739
 a traditional northern dial 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.739
 all of you to nabai that we started 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:11.800
 the decade gave need green pepper 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:14.920
 hot pepper green tomato garlic cut 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:18.220
 well minced chiquitito onion 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:22.420
 julienne sausage to vienna to the 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:26.410
 Viennese ham cooked there we have mashed 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:30.850
 tomato beer pepper cumin 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:32.650
 salt and fresh basil beef 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.880
 this time we put tapas in 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:40.240
 algae pork meat and we use bondiola 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.350
 red sausage and smoked bacon look 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.860
 what is our take on today 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.930
 we declare the disk to make the recipe 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.030
 spectacular a luxury discs already 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.040
 we put oil the first thing we have 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.040
 what to do after that is to add the 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.570
 smoked eye bacon do not mess with the 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.100
 oil because the bacon itself is 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:02.460
 very greasy therefore going to start 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.460
 a lot of liquid 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.470
 and we leave it with fat 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.939
 three minutes 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.220
 what follows is to add the pig the 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.410
 bondiola and red chorizo pork 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.200
 we add it first because remember 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.420
 that has to be always well cooked 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.420
 they are going to see that the meat is taking 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.459
 a color cited brown when all 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.630
 is well even there just add the 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.630
 beef top 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:37.400
 let's start spicing up with salt 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:39.200
 with pepper and cumin eye does not 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.840
 go with the cumin because it's very 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.840
 strong 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.840
 grade 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:53.590
 now it was time to charge him the 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.540
 Garlic this add up the meat 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.910
 Do not touch the disc directly 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.490
 because if it is not going to burn it does not open a 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:04.140
 rich flavor and then we would do everything else 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.140
 of the vegetables the onion 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:13.489
 the morrón 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:18.750
 the tomatoes the spicy stirred the spicy 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:20.550
 the banana the ham and the sausages 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.890
 this does not have to let it brown 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:26.010
 but it softens a bit and there we go 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:29.010
 to go with beer and is he 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:31.590
 we have to put a little bit and leave 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.530
 to be reduced to saying that alcohol is 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:39.069
 evaporate and now if the last the last 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:42.090
 we add the tomato juice 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:42.090
 and oats 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:50.230
 Be careful, do not go over because the 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:52.030
 energy a sauce but very thick and 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:55.410
 then the fresh oregano that we grabbed 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:59.590
 the garden this is how we let it cook 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:01.360
 around 15 minutes and it's going to be 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.760
