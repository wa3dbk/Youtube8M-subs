look is much more for those suffering a

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.160

broken<00:00:19.199> heart<00:00:20.269> for<00:00:21.269> the<00:00:21.390> base<00:00:21.570> I<00:00:21.810> loaded<00:00:22.019> a

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
broken heart for the base I loaded a

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.660 
broken heart for the base I loaded a
sponge<00:00:22.470> with<00:00:22.650> white<00:00:22.859> face<00:00:23.070> pain<00:00:23.339> and<00:00:23.550> then<00:00:23.640> I

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
sponge with white face pain and then I

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.140 
sponge with white face pain and then I
mixed<00:00:24.060> in<00:00:24.179> a<00:00:24.269> small<00:00:24.509> amount<00:00:24.779> of<00:00:24.839> pink<00:00:26.060> using<00:00:27.060> a

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
mixed in a small amount of pink using a

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
stencil with tiny heart cutouts I gently

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.739 
stencil with tiny heart cutouts I gently
applied<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.640> paint<00:00:29.820> around<00:00:30.179> my<00:00:30.269> eyes<00:00:30.449> I

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:30.749 
applied the paint around my eyes I

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:32.630 
applied the paint around my eyes I
wanted<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.410> base<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:31.679> look<00:00:31.800> very<00:00:32.040> soft<00:00:32.369> and

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
wanted the base to look very soft and

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.160 
wanted the base to look very soft and
very<00:00:32.759> subtle<00:00:33.030> so<00:00:33.390> I<00:00:33.420> was<00:00:33.660> careful<00:00:33.990> not<00:00:34.020> to

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
very subtle so I was careful not to

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.380 
very subtle so I was careful not to
apply<00:00:34.440> too<00:00:34.530> much<00:00:34.710> pain

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.650

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
next I took a paradise Prisma cake in

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:49.990 
next I took a paradise Prisma cake in
the<00:00:48.079> color<00:00:48.260> fleur<00:00:48.620> and<00:00:48.890> I<00:00:49.219> loaded<00:00:49.399> a<00:00:49.699> flat

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
the color fleur and I loaded a flat

brush<00:00:50.210> with<00:00:50.449> the<00:00:50.539> last<00:00:50.750> two<00:00:50.960> colors<00:00:52.629> with<00:00:53.629> the

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
brush with the last two colors with the

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.630 
brush with the last two colors with the
pale<00:00:53.930> pink<00:00:54.170> always<00:00:54.589> on<00:00:54.739> the<00:00:54.829> outside<00:00:55.159> edge<00:00:55.370> I

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
pale pink always on the outside edge I

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.579 
pale pink always on the outside edge I
painted<00:00:56.030> five<00:00:56.239> petal<00:00:56.629> shapes<00:00:56.870> and<00:00:57.110> I<00:00:57.379> made

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:57.589 
painted five petal shapes and I made

00:00:57.589 --> 00:00:59.049 
painted five petal shapes and I made
sure<00:00:57.739> that<00:00:57.769> I<00:00:57.920> left<00:00:58.100> a<00:00:58.219> small<00:00:58.370> space<00:00:58.760> right<00:00:59.030> in

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
sure that I left a small space right in

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:09.370 
sure that I left a small space right in
the<00:00:59.239> middle

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.960 

then<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:10.409> painted<00:01:10.830> another<00:01:11.070> flower<00:01:11.369> just<00:01:11.759> above

few<00:01:31.110> rosebuds<00:01:31.590> around<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:31.980> design<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.580> to

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
few rosebuds around the design and to

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.520 
few rosebuds around the design and to
paint<00:01:32.880> this<00:01:33.060> all<00:01:33.300> you<00:01:33.450> do<00:01:33.630> is<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:33.870> small<00:01:34.260> arch

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530

and<00:03:01.530> I<00:03:01.920> gave<00:03:02.189> the<00:03:02.340> Roses<00:03:02.670> and<00:03:02.700> leaves<00:03:03.000> an

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
and I gave the Roses and leaves an

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.270 
and I gave the Roses and leaves an
outline<00:03:03.510> now<00:03:04.079> is<00:03:04.260> very<00:03:04.439> careful<00:03:04.829> not<00:03:05.010> to<00:03:05.069> make

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
outline now is very careful not to make

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.500 
outline now is very careful not to make
the<00:03:05.400> lines<00:03:05.579> too<00:03:05.849> harsh<00:03:06.090> or<00:03:06.360> perfect

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:36.110 

you

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.149 

I<00:03:36.150> added<00:03:36.930> white<00:03:37.230> middles<00:03:37.590> to<00:03:37.769> the<00:03:37.890> smaller

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:38.159 
I added white middles to the smaller

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:39.710 
I added white middles to the smaller
flowers<00:03:38.610> and<00:03:38.790> then<00:03:38.940> I<00:03:39.000> went<00:03:39.180> round<00:03:39.269> the<00:03:39.420> design

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
flowers and then I went round the design

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.180 
flowers and then I went round the design
filling<00:03:40.049> in<00:03:40.140> any<00:03:40.230> spaces<00:03:40.769> with<00:03:40.920> a<00:03:40.950> few

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
filling in any spaces with a few

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:59.750 
filling in any spaces with a few
clusters<00:03:41.610> of<00:03:41.640> dots

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.190 

for<00:04:00.760> the<00:04:00.850> lips<00:04:01.030> I<00:04:01.240> use<00:04:01.510> the<00:04:01.690> lighter<00:04:01.900> color

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
for the lips I use the lighter color

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:14.960 
for the lips I use the lighter color
from<00:04:02.410> the<00:04:02.500> Prisma<00:04:02.830> block<00:04:03.010> all<00:04:03.220> over

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.940 

and<00:04:15.090> then<00:04:15.720> I<00:04:15.810> took<00:04:15.870> the<00:04:16.140> darker<00:04:16.320> red<00:04:16.650> and<00:04:16.890> I

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
and then I took the darker red and I

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.320 
and then I took the darker red and I
blended<00:04:17.310> it<00:04:17.430> in<00:04:17.519> all<00:04:17.790> around<00:04:18.060> the<00:04:18.180> outside

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.330 
blended it in all around the outside

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:20.740 
blended it in all around the outside
edge

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:35.900 

you

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.090 

for<00:04:36.690> a<00:04:36.720> little<00:04:36.840> bit<00:04:37.020> of<00:04:37.080> sparkle<00:04:37.530> I<00:04:37.710> used<00:04:37.950> an

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:38.100 
for a little bit of sparkle I used an

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.920 
for a little bit of sparkle I used an
iridescent<00:04:38.430> white<00:04:38.790> glitter<00:04:39.060> over<00:04:39.420> my<00:04:39.540> eyelids

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
iridescent white glitter over my eyelids

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.870 
iridescent white glitter over my eyelids
and<00:04:40.110> then<00:04:40.560> I<00:04:40.620> also<00:04:40.800> added<00:04:41.100> a<00:04:41.310> small<00:04:41.430> amount<00:04:41.760> to

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
and then I also added a small amount to

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:50.959 
and then I also added a small amount to
some<00:04:42.090> of<00:04:42.180> the<00:04:42.270> flowers

00:04:50.959 --> 00:04:50.969 

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:54.959 

you

00:04:54.959 --> 00:04:54.969 

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:57.249 

once<00:04:55.969> I<00:04:56.119> was<00:04:56.210> finished<00:04:56.539> with<00:04:56.689> the<00:04:56.719> face<00:04:56.990> I

00:04:57.249 --> 00:04:57.259 
once I was finished with the face I

00:04:57.259 --> 00:04:58.600 
once I was finished with the face I
decided<00:04:57.619> to<00:04:57.830> use<00:04:57.949> exactly<00:04:58.399> the<00:04:58.580> same

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
decided to use exactly the same

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.579 
decided to use exactly the same
techniques<00:04:59.240> and<00:04:59.449> continue<00:04:59.869> the<00:04:59.990> design<00:05:00.319> down

00:05:00.579 --> 00:05:00.589 
techniques and continue the design down

00:05:00.589 --> 00:05:03.309 
techniques and continue the design down
onto<00:05:00.979> my<00:05:01.099> chest
