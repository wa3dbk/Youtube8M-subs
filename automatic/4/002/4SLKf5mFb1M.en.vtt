Chum that we make for the new Jayce it's

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.060 
Chum that we make for the new Jayce it's
fine<00:00:11.610> and<00:00:12.480> once<00:00:12.690> they<00:00:12.809> have<00:00:12.929> a<00:00:13.070> fine

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
fine and once they have a fine

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.330 
fine and once they have a fine
consistency<00:00:15.000> to<00:00:15.210> it<00:00:15.650> so<00:00:16.650> what<00:00:16.740> I<00:00:16.770> do<00:00:16.920> is<00:00:17.190> I<00:00:17.310> just

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
consistency to it so what I do is I just

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.820 
consistency to it so what I do is I just
take<00:00:17.730> and<00:00:18.000> cut<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.779> mackerel<00:00:19.230> into<00:00:19.500> chunks

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:21.830 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.420 

it's<00:00:22.830> easy<00:00:23.220> if<00:00:23.400> is<00:00:23.609> easier<00:00:24.029> in<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:25.430> grinder

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
it's easy if is easier in the grinder

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:35.060 
it's easy if is easier in the grinder
this<00:00:26.609> way<00:00:29.539> chunk<00:00:30.539> up<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.840> couple<00:00:31.199> here<00:00:34.070> heads

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
this way chunk up a couple here heads

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.010 
this way chunk up a couple here heads
and<00:00:35.340> all<00:00:35.430> kinda<00:00:36.300> works<00:00:36.480> really<00:00:36.719> well<00:00:36.960> for

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
and all kinda works really well for

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.889 
and all kinda works really well for
making<00:00:37.649> it<00:00:37.739> I<00:00:38.090> have<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.120> fine<00:00:40.340> blade<00:00:41.340> on<00:00:41.670> my<00:00:41.899> meat

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
making it I have a fine blade on my meat

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.290 
making it I have a fine blade on my meat
grinder<00:00:43.410> I<00:00:43.710> find<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.460> fine<00:00:44.700> blade<00:00:45.000> works

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
grinder I find that the fine blade works

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.580 
grinder I find that the fine blade works
best<00:00:45.600> for<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.469> right<00:00:47.039> consistency<00:00:48.440> chop<00:00:49.440> it

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
best for the right consistency chop it

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.959 
best for the right consistency chop it
up<00:00:49.760> then<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:50.879> can<00:00:52.250> just<00:00:53.250> start<00:00:53.399> stuffing<00:00:53.820> it

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
up then I can just start stuffing it

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.369 
up then I can just start stuffing it
into<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.390> meat<00:00:54.750> grinder

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.660 

pretty<00:02:32.250> simple<00:02:33.950> law<00:02:34.950> do<00:02:35.010> you<00:02:35.130> guys<00:02:35.340> probably

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
pretty simple law do you guys probably

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.600 
pretty simple law do you guys probably
already<00:02:35.940> have<00:02:36.209> a<00:02:36.240> meat<00:02:36.569> grinder<00:02:37.160> if<00:02:38.160> you<00:02:38.310> don't

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
already have a meat grinder if you don't

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.270 
already have a meat grinder if you don't
they're<00:02:39.120> not<00:02:39.240> really<00:02:39.420> expensive<00:02:39.959> I<00:02:40.440> think

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
they're not really expensive I think

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.050 
they're not really expensive I think
that<00:02:41.459> one<00:02:41.610> there<00:02:41.790> was<00:02:42.000> $40<00:02:42.780> and<00:02:43.790> as<00:02:44.790> you<00:02:44.910> can

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
that one there was $40 and as you can

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.630 
that one there was $40 and as you can
see<00:02:45.239> it<00:02:45.390> makes<00:02:45.540> a<00:02:45.660> nice<00:02:45.840> nice<00:02:46.500> consistency<00:02:47.430> to

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
see it makes a nice nice consistency to

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:54.050 
see it makes a nice nice consistency to
it<00:02:48.170> what<00:02:49.170> I<00:02:49.200> do<00:02:49.319> is<00:02:52.489> you<00:02:53.489> can<00:02:53.640> use<00:02:53.790> your<00:02:53.910> own
