00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 hello everyone with you loaf and so 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.189
 happened that I happened to be and 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.500
 there and there i played bf3 and bf4 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.139
 and played in the army such usual 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.360
 standard army without directly and sharing 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:19.820
 with my experience, I will try to compare services 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:22.650
 in battle and service in the Russian army went 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.990
 to touch the world 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.289
 battlefield you need on average from 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.810
 500 to 5000 rubles to purchase the game 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.360
 minimum prices usually fall on 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.760
 the holiday is supposed to have you already 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.280
 there is a game bye or console for 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.500
 run for the game you should have like 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.020
 minimum eyes and two hands with 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.530
 fingers for a comfortable game you need 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.530
 add 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.899
 the minimum requirements for the army 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.300
 somewhat lower access you get 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.280
 absolutely free exists 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.370
 health requirements but they are not 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.800
 significantly higher than bf here you plus 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.430
 everything will need arms and legs to 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.690
 run and carry heavy objects 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.510
 battlefield how much fun 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.880
 more expensive army army in turn can 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.310
 bring a nice fan of real 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.770
 doubloons which can be saved for a year and 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.750
 buy a good gaming computer and 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.229
 also all the last part of the battlefield 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:22.590
 premium subscriptions and this is me now 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.720
 joked I brought home 70,000 it was 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.970
 only minimal official farm 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.119
 half of the year I spent on 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.100
 food clothes and various nishtyaki unfortunately 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.920
 so not everywhere and to farm more 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.049
 hundred thousand without divorce and robbery to you 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.689
 have to get a good place 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:43.579
 Based on the foregoing, we conclude 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:46.380
 that in terms of accessibility, the army wins 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:48.899
 battlefield more special effects in the army 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.360
 they are smaller but emotions bring more 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.299
 shootout in on whose tracers volleys 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.149
 howitzers tracked vehicles making their way 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.700
 through the grove incidentally throwing trees all 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:02.100
 it is certainly not so impressive but more 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.969
 Is it alive that so in this paragraph I 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.459
 awarded the victory in the Battle reals us 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.640
 hundreds of weapons and dozens 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.010
 types of equipment 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.260
 no military unit can you 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.890
 Provide all of this standard 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:23.410
 set the player to the army is without l110 hours to a 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:26.640
 to m 74 or aksu 74 maybe lpg or pkm 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:29.140
 and also a sapper shovel where without it 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.350
 special sets you will be available 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.830
 svd mortar or even a flamethrower which 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.450
 by the way in bf there is no air technology 

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:39.480
 unavailable for conscripts 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.700
 but here are ground wheeled and tracked 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.560
 fighting vehicles can be unlocked but 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.350
 as a rule in the singular 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.570
 pumping is possible in both cases but in 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:52.900
 You can fight against Colonel for 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.580
 one hundred other hours in the army in 365 days 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.040
 maximum to foremen 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.519
 unexpected gaming moments more in 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.080
 army army is generally one solid 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:04.690
 surprise win award battles 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:09.130
 all the same interesting for a unit of time 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:11.410
 doesn't happen anymore in multiplayer 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.110
 the plot as such is not we either 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.600
 seize something either defend or 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.970
 we kill each other in the army, everything is different 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:23.190
 each one served can write about it 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:25.540
 whole book and it will be interesting 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.670
 thanks to the battlefield you will learn about 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.100
 most modern weapons and 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.530
 military equipment thanks to the army you 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:35.410
 learn to materialize anything 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.090
 from absolute emptiness served that 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.570
 now understand what I mean 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.340
 victory for the army and so on the results 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:46.140
 comparison won 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.140
 army serve in the army
