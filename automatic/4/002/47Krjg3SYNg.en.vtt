sculpting<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.689> object<00:01:31.170> before<00:01:31.290> I<00:01:31.560> get<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:32.009> and

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
sculpting the object before I get it and

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.219 
sculpting the object before I get it and
then<00:01:32.790> when<00:01:32.939> I<00:01:32.970> see<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.360> come<00:01:33.540> in<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.750> shop<00:01:33.990> I

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
then when I see it come in the shop I

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.719 
then when I see it come in the shop I
like<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.740> be<00:01:34.860> able<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.040> go<00:01:35.189> out<00:01:35.310> there<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.579> look

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
like to be able to go out there and look

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.160 
like to be able to go out there and look
at<00:01:35.880> that<00:01:36.000> part<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.390> say<00:01:36.540> hey<00:01:36.689> that's<00:01:36.869> just

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
at that part and say hey that's just

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.780 
at that part and say hey that's just
what<00:01:37.350> we<00:01:37.470> had<00:01:37.650> on<00:01:37.799> our<00:01:37.829> screen<00:01:38.250> look<00:01:38.490> there<00:01:38.700> it

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
what we had on our screen look there it

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.330 
what we had on our screen look there it
is<00:01:38.880> today<00:01:39.270> takes<00:01:39.750> me<00:01:39.960> maybe<00:01:40.200> five<00:01:40.770> minutes<00:01:40.920> to

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
is today takes me maybe five minutes to

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.969 
is today takes me maybe five minutes to
create<00:01:41.610> a<00:01:41.640> part<00:01:41.939> that<00:01:42.000> way<00:01:42.270> when<00:01:43.200> I<00:01:43.229> have<00:01:43.680> a

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
create a part that way when I have a

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.370 
create a part that way when I have a
pump<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.970> housings<00:01:45.420> might<00:01:45.659> be<00:01:45.840> made<00:01:46.110> in

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
pump the housings might be made in

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.270 
pump the housings might be made in
Cincinnati<00:01:47.009> they<00:01:47.759> might<00:01:48.000> be<00:01:48.210> cast<00:01:48.990> in<00:01:49.439> Chicago

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
Cincinnati they might be cast in Chicago

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.719 
Cincinnati they might be cast in Chicago
that<00:01:50.549> could<00:01:50.729> be<00:01:50.909> machined<00:01:51.420> in<00:01:51.689> Texas<00:01:52.259> or<00:01:52.560> in

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
that could be machined in Texas or in

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.609 
that could be machined in Texas or in
Arizona<00:01:53.729> but<00:01:54.030> they'll<00:01:54.180> all<00:01:54.390> come<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:55.140> Las

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
Arizona but they'll all come to Las

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.130 
Arizona but they'll all come to Las
Vegas<00:01:56.159> for<00:01:56.430> final<00:01:56.820> assembly<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.329> testing<00:01:57.840> I

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
Vegas for final assembly and testing I

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.510 
Vegas for final assembly and testing I
think<00:01:58.259> that's<00:01:58.590> where<00:01:58.799> sawing<00:01:59.100> works<00:01:59.310> really

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
think that's where sawing works really

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.770
