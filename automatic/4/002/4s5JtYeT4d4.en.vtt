00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
this is an in-progress product review of

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.720 
this is an in-progress product review of
the<00:00:04.650> healthy<00:00:05.069> juicer<00:00:05.520> by<00:00:05.700> lexan<00:00:06.230> I<00:00:07.730> tried

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
the healthy juicer by lexan I tried

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.520 
the healthy juicer by lexan I tried
looking<00:00:08.910> at<00:00:09.269> the<00:00:09.450> instruction<00:00:09.960> manual<00:00:10.320> last

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
looking at the instruction manual last

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.410 
looking at the instruction manual last
night<00:00:10.769> so<00:00:11.010> that<00:00:11.160> I'd<00:00:11.250> be<00:00:11.280> able<00:00:11.490> to<00:00:11.759> just<00:00:12.120> put<00:00:12.330> it

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
night so that I'd be able to just put it

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.709 
night so that I'd be able to just put it
straight<00:00:12.780> together<00:00:13.290> but<00:00:14.509> this<00:00:15.509> little

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
straight together but this little

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.230 
straight together but this little
instruction<00:00:16.379> here<00:00:16.680> says<00:00:17.010> assemble<00:00:17.609> parts<00:00:17.940> 3

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
instruction here says assemble parts 3

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.090 
instruction here says assemble parts 3
through<00:00:18.510> 4<00:00:18.840> into<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.410> main<00:00:19.560> body<00:00:19.770> of<00:00:19.980> the

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
through 4 into the main body of the

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.990 
through 4 into the main body of the
juicer<00:00:20.550> 8<00:00:21.500> that<00:00:22.500> is<00:00:22.830> pretty<00:00:23.130> much<00:00:23.369> as<00:00:23.699> far<00:00:23.970> as

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
juicer 8 that is pretty much as far as

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.779 
juicer 8 that is pretty much as far as
the<00:00:24.150> instructions<00:00:24.660> go<00:00:24.840> but<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:26.070> piece<00:00:26.279> is<00:00:26.519> 3

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
the instructions go but the piece is 3

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.450 
the instructions go but the piece is 3
through<00:00:27.170> 4r<00:00:28.580> this<00:00:29.580> piece<00:00:29.820> here<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:31.460> this

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
through 4r this piece here and this

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.930 
through 4r this piece here and this
little<00:00:32.610> bit<00:00:32.910> here<00:00:33.149> on<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.360> end<00:00:34.130> 8<00:00:35.130> would<00:00:35.700> be

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
little bit here on the end 8 would be

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.229 
little bit here on the end 8 would be
all<00:00:36.600> of<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.050> pieces<00:00:37.260> so<00:00:37.680> right<00:00:38.280> there<00:00:38.550> I<00:00:38.760> think

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
all of the pieces so right there I think

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.690 
all of the pieces so right there I think
they<00:00:39.420> meant<00:00:39.629> pieces<00:00:40.140> 3<00:00:40.379> through<00:00:40.620> 8<00:00:40.649> it's<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.520> lot

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
they meant pieces 3 through 8 it's a lot

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.619 
they meant pieces 3 through 8 it's a lot
simpler<00:00:42.000> than<00:00:42.770> it<00:00:43.770> is<00:00:44.100> actually<00:00:44.789> very<00:00:45.000> easy<00:00:45.180> to

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
simpler than it is actually very easy to

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.190 
simpler than it is actually very easy to
put<00:00:45.780> together<00:00:47.300> this<00:00:48.300> piece<00:00:48.570> doesn't

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
put together this piece doesn't

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.630 
put together this piece doesn't
necessarily<00:00:49.800> come<00:00:50.010> on<00:00:50.280> but<00:00:51.090> mine<00:00:51.930> did<00:00:52.640> just

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
necessarily come on but mine did just

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.000 
necessarily come on but mine did just
slide<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:54.090> right<00:00:54.710> into<00:00:55.710> here<00:00:57.530> this<00:00:58.530> piece<00:00:58.800> has

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
slide it right into here this piece has

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.939 
slide it right into here this piece has
a<00:00:59.039> little<00:00:59.399> nylon<00:00:59.850> ring<00:01:00.629> inside<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.289> if<00:01:01.440> it

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
a little nylon ring inside it if it

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.130 
a little nylon ring inside it if it
doesn't<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.910> package<00:01:03.239> comes<00:01:03.449> with<00:01:03.600> extras

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
doesn't the package comes with extras

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.609 
doesn't the package comes with extras
you<00:01:04.170> can<00:01:04.379> just<00:01:04.680> line<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:04.890> in<00:01:05.729> there<00:01:06.090> and

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
you can just line it in there and

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:11.950 
you can just line it in there and
actually<00:01:07.619> twist<00:01:08.159> on<00:01:09.170> counter<00:01:10.170> clockwise

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
actually twist on counter clockwise

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.270 
actually twist on counter clockwise
which<00:01:12.960> is<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.170> pain<00:01:13.470> if<00:01:13.740> you<00:01:13.770> don't<00:01:13.860> remember

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
which is a pain if you don't remember

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.530 
which is a pain if you don't remember
that<00:01:14.460> little<00:01:15.420> tiny<00:01:16.280> cat<00:01:17.280> goes<00:01:17.640> on<00:01:17.820> there<00:01:18.090> that

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
that little tiny cat goes on there that

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.530 
that little tiny cat goes on there that
goes<00:01:18.840> on<00:01:18.990> clockwise<00:01:20.119> that's<00:01:21.119> all<00:01:21.390> pretty

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
goes on clockwise that's all pretty

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.090 
goes on clockwise that's all pretty
normal<00:01:22.939> slide<00:01:23.939> right<00:01:24.479> in<00:01:25.380> like<00:01:25.590> that<00:01:25.619> that's

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
normal slide right in like that that's

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.999 
normal slide right in like that that's
very<00:01:26.340> easy<00:01:27.829> put<00:01:28.829> this<00:01:29.040> clip<00:01:30.560> into<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.590> small

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
very easy put this clip into a small

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.740 
very easy put this clip into a small
hole<00:01:32.250> in<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.579> back<00:01:32.729> oh<00:01:32.970> it's<00:01:33.210> not<00:01:33.299> that<00:01:33.360> small

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
hole in the back oh it's not that small

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.249 
hole in the back oh it's not that small
and<00:01:34.520> see<00:01:35.520> my<00:01:35.909> counters<00:01:36.420> are<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.659> little<00:01:36.869> shallow

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
and see my counters are a little shallow

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.710 
and see my counters are a little shallow
so<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.979> only<00:01:38.189> place<00:01:38.670> where<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:39.000> can<00:01:39.210> twist<00:01:39.479> it

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
so the only place where I can twist it

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.359 
so the only place where I can twist it
on<00:01:39.950> right<00:01:40.950> here<00:01:41.400> in<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.850> corner<00:01:43.100> to<00:01:44.100> get<00:01:44.250> it

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
on right here in the corner to get it

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.130 
on right here in the corner to get it
nice<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.579> tight<00:01:44.850> without<00:01:45.360> breaking<00:01:46.110> my

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
nice and tight without breaking my

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.580 
nice and tight without breaking my
fingers<00:01:46.290> or<00:01:46.890> anything<00:01:47.280> else<00:01:48.500> then<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.740> handle

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
fingers or anything else then the handle

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.030 
fingers or anything else then the handle
have<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.770> line<00:01:52.950> up<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.280> grooves

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
have to line up the grooves

00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:01.060 
have to line up the grooves
and<00:01:55.660> then<00:01:57.940> clockwise<00:01:58.940> tighten<00:01:59.810> it<00:02:00.080> now<00:02:01.010> the

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
and then clockwise tighten it now the

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.760 
and then clockwise tighten it now the
problem<00:02:01.520> is<00:02:01.670> if<00:02:02.150> you<00:02:02.450> have<00:02:02.690> a<00:02:02.990> set<00:02:03.290> up<00:02:03.380> like<00:02:03.590> my

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
problem is if you have a set up like my

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.700 
problem is if you have a set up like my
counter<00:02:04.180> where<00:02:05.180> the<00:02:05.720> only<00:02:05.960> place<00:02:06.170> that<00:02:06.440> it'll

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
counter where the only place that it'll

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.280 
counter where the only place that it'll
fit<00:02:06.920> with<00:02:07.520> the<00:02:07.670> clip<00:02:08.090> to<00:02:08.330> hold<00:02:08.509> it<00:02:08.690> steady<00:02:08.990> in

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:09.290 
fit with the clip to hold it steady in

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:13.630 
fit with the clip to hold it steady in
the<00:02:10.070> corner<00:02:10.399> is<00:02:10.580> them<00:02:11.860> when<00:02:12.860> you<00:02:13.010> try<00:02:13.250> to<00:02:13.310> turn

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
the corner is them when you try to turn

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.860 
the corner is them when you try to turn
the<00:02:13.820> handle<00:02:14.260> it<00:02:15.260> does<00:02:15.860> that<00:02:16.570> so<00:02:17.570> I'm<00:02:17.690> going<00:02:17.840> to

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
the handle it does that so I'm going to

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.390 
the handle it does that so I'm going to
have<00:02:17.990> to<00:02:18.110> take<00:02:18.230> it<00:02:18.290> over<00:02:18.500> to<00:02:18.710> the<00:02:19.010> breakfast

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
have to take it over to the breakfast

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.910 
have to take it over to the breakfast
nook<00:02:19.550> set<00:02:20.480> it<00:02:20.600> up<00:02:20.720> again<00:02:20.960> and<00:02:21.260> then<00:02:21.620> try<00:02:21.800> to

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
nook set it up again and then try to

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.120 
nook set it up again and then try to

juice now that I have the juicer set up

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.880 
juice now that I have the juicer set up
somewhere<00:02:25.400> that<00:02:25.760> it<00:02:26.320> shouldn't<00:02:27.320> have<00:02:27.680> any

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
somewhere that it shouldn't have any

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:28.530 
somewhere that it shouldn't have any
problems

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540

so<00:05:09.100> far<00:05:09.310> like<00:05:09.520> the<00:05:09.639> machine<00:05:09.970> can't<00:05:10.419> tell<00:05:10.570> you

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630 
so far like the machine can't tell you

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:11.700 
so far like the machine can't tell you
anything<00:05:10.810> about<00:05:10.960> the<00:05:11.139> grass<00:05:11.320> I<00:05:11.500> haven't

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
anything about the grass I haven't

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.010 
anything about the grass I haven't
tasted<00:05:11.830> it<00:05:12.100> but<00:05:12.310> I<00:05:12.460> like<00:05:12.729> the<00:05:12.880> machine<00:05:13.150> now

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
tasted it but I like the machine now

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.680 
tasted it but I like the machine now
here<00:05:14.410> I've<00:05:14.620> bought<00:05:15.039> some<00:05:15.400> organic<00:05:15.639> kale<00:05:16.330> and

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
here I've bought some organic kale and

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:22.680 
here I've bought some organic kale and
so<00:05:16.870> in<00:05:17.199> a<00:05:17.229> card<00:05:17.710> and<00:05:18.039> I<00:05:18.849> found<00:05:19.180> that<00:05:21.690> thicker

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
so in a card and I found that thicker

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.830 
so in a card and I found that thicker
like<00:05:23.289> that<00:05:23.530> don't<00:05:23.889> go<00:05:24.039> down<00:05:24.280> as<00:05:25.210> easily<00:05:25.449> as<00:05:25.750> the

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 
like that don't go down as easily as the

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.629 
like that don't go down as easily as the
grass<00:05:26.020> did<00:05:26.259> so<00:05:26.889> you<00:05:26.949> need<00:05:27.130> this<00:05:27.310> little

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:27.639 
grass did so you need this little

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:39.800 
grass did so you need this little
plunger<00:05:28.449> and<00:05:31.080> it's<00:05:32.080> loud<00:05:32.410> but<00:05:32.440> it<00:05:32.889> works<00:05:33.070> great

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:39.810 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.330 

seems<00:05:40.810> to<00:05:40.990> be<00:05:41.110> creating<00:05:41.590> a<00:05:41.680> lot<00:05:41.860> more<00:05:42.070> juice

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:42.340 
seems to be creating a lot more juice

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:49.140 
seems to be creating a lot more juice
than<00:05:42.370> the<00:05:43.080> grass<00:05:44.080> did<00:05:44.349> but<00:05:48.150> following

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.150 
than the grass did but following

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.300 
than the grass did but following
instructions<00:05:49.780> not<00:05:50.139> to<00:05:50.169> use<00:05:50.590> my<00:05:50.800> fingers<00:05:51.159> to

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.310 
instructions not to use my fingers to

00:05:51.310 --> 00:06:02.530 
instructions not to use my fingers to
push<00:05:51.639> it<00:05:51.760> down

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:02.540 

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:11.500 

I<00:06:08.560> like<00:06:09.560> how<00:06:09.800> even<00:06:10.280> though<00:06:10.460> it's<00:06:10.640> big<00:06:11.030> leafy

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:11.510 
I like how even though it's big leafy

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.230 
I like how even though it's big leafy
greens<00:06:12.070> still<00:06:13.070> comes<00:06:13.280> out<00:06:13.460> in<00:06:13.610> a<00:06:13.670> nice<00:06:13.880> dry

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:14.240 
greens still comes out in a nice dry

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.950 
greens still comes out in a nice dry
snake<00:06:15.130> although<00:06:16.130> it<00:06:16.190> does<00:06:16.370> drip<00:06:16.700> I<00:06:17.180> might<00:06:17.810> I

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:17.960 
snake although it does drip I might I

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.570 
snake although it does drip I might I
might<00:06:18.020> just<00:06:18.530> need<00:06:18.620> to<00:06:18.830> tighten<00:06:19.070> that<00:06:19.310> but

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:19.580 
might just need to tighten that but

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.430 
might just need to tighten that but
you'll<00:06:20.240> want<00:06:20.420> to<00:06:20.480> put<00:06:20.660> something<00:06:20.870> down<00:06:21.110> under

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:21.440 
you'll want to put something down under

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:22.660 
you'll want to put something down under
the<00:06:21.560> bowl<00:06:21.710> of<00:06:21.860> the<00:06:21.980> bowl<00:06:22.130> doesn't<00:06:22.280> go<00:06:22.550> the

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:22.670 
the bowl of the bowl doesn't go the

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:25.780 
the bowl of the bowl doesn't go the
whole<00:06:22.820> way<00:06:22.940> back<00:06:23.180> down<00:06:24.460> but<00:06:25.460> other<00:06:25.580> than<00:06:25.730> that

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:25.790 
whole way back down but other than that

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:29.410 
whole way back down but other than that
the<00:06:26.270> machine<00:06:26.960> works<00:06:27.200> very<00:06:27.380> well<00:06:27.470> and<00:06:28.420> is

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:29.420 
the machine works very well and is

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:32.290 
the machine works very well and is
fairly<00:06:29.750> easy<00:06:29.900> to<00:06:30.140> clean<00:06:30.440> but<00:06:30.670> it<00:06:31.670> can<00:06:32.000> drip<00:06:32.270> a

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:32.300 
fairly easy to clean but it can drip a

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.020 
fairly easy to clean but it can drip a
bit<00:06:32.590> there<00:06:33.590> is<00:06:33.770> one<00:06:34.100> bad<00:06:34.340> thing<00:06:34.640> about<00:06:34.760> the

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:35.030 
bit there is one bad thing about the

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:37.600 
bit there is one bad thing about the
design<00:06:35.300> of<00:06:35.450> this<00:06:35.570> Cup<00:06:36.340> notice<00:06:37.340> how<00:06:37.460> it's

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:37.610 
design of this Cup notice how it's

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:39.420 
design of this Cup notice how it's
curved<00:06:37.850> so<00:06:38.180> it<00:06:38.210> can<00:06:38.450> fit<00:06:38.600> around<00:06:38.750> the<00:06:38.960> juicer

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:39.430 
curved so it can fit around the juicer

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:42.550 
curved so it can fit around the juicer
problem<00:06:40.430> is<00:06:40.610> if<00:06:40.820> you<00:06:41.060> forget<00:06:41.570> that<00:06:41.840> this<00:06:42.230> end

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:42.560 
problem is if you forget that this end

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.980 
problem is if you forget that this end
has<00:06:42.770> a<00:06:42.830> spout<00:06:43.250> too<00:06:43.520> and<00:06:44.300> you<00:06:44.420> try<00:06:44.600> to<00:06:44.630> pour<00:06:44.930> it

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:44.990 
has a spout too and you try to pour it

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:48.040 
has a spout too and you try to pour it
out<00:06:45.050> this<00:06:45.290> way<00:06:45.530> oh<00:06:46.540> there<00:06:47.540> it<00:06:47.630> goes<00:06:47.750> out<00:06:47.900> both

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:48.050 
out this way oh there it goes out both

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.080 
out this way oh there it goes out both
sides<00:06:48.940> careful

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:50.090 
sides careful

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:52.000 
sides careful
remember<00:06:50.510> to<00:06:50.630> tilt<00:06:50.870> this<00:06:51.050> before<00:06:51.440> before<00:06:51.530> or

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:52.010 
remember to tilt this before before or

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:55.060 
remember to tilt this before before or
you're<00:06:52.220> gonna<00:06:52.460> regret<00:06:52.790> it
