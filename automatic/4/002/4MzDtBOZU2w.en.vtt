00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
color then I found some hops that I

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.260 
color then I found some hops that I
thought<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.500> could<00:01:25.680> be<00:01:25.830> fun<00:01:26.070> too<00:01:26.430> so<00:01:26.729> you<00:01:27.090> can

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
again double check make sure that you're

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.490 
again double check make sure that you're
centered<00:02:53.099> so<00:02:53.519> it<00:02:53.609> will<00:02:53.730> hang<00:02:53.969> straight<00:02:54.450> and<00:02:55.139> go

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
centered so it will hang straight and go

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.830 
centered so it will hang straight and go
ahead<00:02:55.650> and<00:02:56.069> add<00:02:56.549> your<00:02:56.819> water

materials the seat I'm so bulky break

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.280 
materials the seat I'm so bulky break
off<00:03:07.080> all<00:03:07.260> that<00:03:07.470> lower<00:03:07.709> foliage<00:03:08.340> give<00:03:08.760> it<00:03:08.879> a<00:03:08.940> cut

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
off all that lower foliage give it a cut

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:15.380 
off all that lower foliage give it a cut
and<00:03:11.030> then<00:03:12.030> set<00:03:12.420> it<00:03:12.450> in<00:03:12.660> place<00:03:13.790> and<00:03:14.790> it<00:03:14.910> just

and then set it in place and it just

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.050 
and then set it in place and it just
weaves<00:03:15.720> around<00:03:15.989> the<00:03:16.470> handle<00:03:16.980> I<00:03:17.250> have<00:03:17.519> a<00:03:17.580> second

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
piece put on the opposite side and then

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.729 
piece put on the opposite side and then
once<00:03:26.700> again<00:03:27.180> weaving<00:03:27.720> it<00:03:27.810> around<00:03:28.080> the<00:03:28.260> handle

once again weaving it around the handle

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.759 
once again weaving it around the handle
as<00:03:28.830> I<00:03:28.980> set<00:03:29.250> it<00:03:29.400> in<00:03:29.959> wanting<00:03:30.959> to<00:03:31.049> make<00:03:31.200> sure<00:03:31.500> is

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
as I set it in wanting to make sure is

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.650 
as I set it in wanting to make sure is
this<00:03:32.040> going<00:03:32.310> to<00:03:32.340> stay<00:03:32.580> centered<00:03:33.150> so<00:03:33.450> that<00:03:33.569> it

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
this going to stay centered so that it

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:36.319 
this going to stay centered so that it
hangs<00:03:33.900> correctly<00:03:34.709> now<00:03:35.310> you<00:03:35.370> may<00:03:35.730> just<00:03:36.060> leave

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
hangs correctly now you may just leave

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:39.080 
hangs correctly now you may just leave
it<00:03:36.510> sitting<00:03:36.870> on<00:03:37.049> the<00:03:37.170> table<00:03:37.410> or<00:03:38.190> you<00:03:38.459> may<00:03:38.670> hang
