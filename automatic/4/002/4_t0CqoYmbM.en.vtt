00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
with a Snapdragon 800 when I tested out

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.629 
with a Snapdragon 800 when I tested out
the<00:00:13.139> Sony<00:00:13.440> Xperia<00:00:13.530> said<00:00:14.099> there<00:00:14.490> were<00:00:14.610> two

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
the Sony Xperia said there were two

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.880 
the Sony Xperia said there were two
vital<00:00:15.059> problems<00:00:15.509> that<00:00:15.690> I<00:00:15.719> found<00:00:16.049> with<00:00:16.199> it<00:00:16.350> one

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
vital problems that I found with it one

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.950 
vital problems that I found with it one
was<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.250> leggy<00:00:17.430> performance<00:00:18.060> I<00:00:18.210> think<00:00:18.240> the<00:00:18.600> s4

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
was the leggy performance I think the s4

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.570 
was the leggy performance I think the s4
pro<00:00:19.170> that<00:00:19.350> was<00:00:19.470> inside<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.980> experience<00:00:20.400> said

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
pro that was inside the experience said

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.460 
pro that was inside the experience said
couldn't<00:00:21.150> quite<00:00:21.420> handle<00:00:21.660> that<00:00:21.960> 1080p

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
couldn't quite handle that 1080p

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.290 
couldn't quite handle that 1080p
resolution<00:00:23.100> so<00:00:23.340> they'll<00:00:23.640> fix<00:00:23.910> that<00:00:24.150> by

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
resolution so they'll fix that by

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.300 
resolution so they'll fix that by
putting<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.660> Snapdragon<00:00:25.170> 800<00:00:25.590> in<00:00:25.710> it<00:00:25.859> which

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
putting the Snapdragon 800 in it which

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
the second thing was the screen now I

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.130 
the second thing was the screen now I
was<00:00:50.640> disappointed<00:00:50.940> by<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.390> sony<00:00:51.629> experience

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
was disappointed by the sony experience

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.630 
was disappointed by the sony experience
dead<00:00:52.260> screen<00:00:52.590> i<00:00:52.620> didn't<00:00:53.039> think<00:00:53.070> it<00:00:53.309> lived<00:00:53.520> up

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640

to<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.940> hype<00:00:53.969> I<00:00:54.420> thought<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.170> viewing<00:00:55.800> angles

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
to the hype I thought the viewing angles

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.220 
to the hype I thought the viewing angles
kind<00:00:56.340> of<00:00:56.460> sucked<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:56.850> stuff<00:00:57.030> like<00:00:57.149> that

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
kind of sucked and stuff like that

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.020 
kind of sucked and stuff like that
according<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.260> this<00:00:58.440> leak<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:59.129> prototype

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
according to this leak the prototype

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.389 
according to this leak the prototype
came<00:01:00.420> with<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.750> LCD<00:01:01.379> 3<00:01:01.710> screen<00:01:02.039> with<00:01:02.250> that

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
came with the LCD 3 screen with that

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.270 
came with the LCD 3 screen with that
that<00:01:02.699> was<00:01:02.850> on<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.120> HTC<00:01:03.809> One<00:01:04.199> which<00:01:04.769> I<00:01:05.040> thought

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
that was on the HTC One which I thought

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.730 
that was on the HTC One which I thought
was<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.489> really<00:01:06.000> really<00:01:06.479> impressive<00:01:07.020> screen<00:01:07.470> so

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
was a really really impressive screen so

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.770 
was a really really impressive screen so
I<00:01:07.770> really<00:01:08.189> do<00:01:08.310> hope<00:01:08.490> they<00:01:08.729> keep<00:01:08.909> that<00:01:09.180> although

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780

there<00:01:20.970> with<00:01:21.119> Snapdragon<00:01:21.659> 800<00:01:22.080> it's<00:01:22.439> really

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
there with Snapdragon 800 it's really

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.620 
there with Snapdragon 800 it's really
fast<00:01:23.189> that's<00:01:23.490> expected<00:01:23.970> because<00:01:24.299> this

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
fast that's expected because this

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.530 
fast that's expected because this
Snapdragon<00:01:25.140> 800<00:01:25.590> is<00:01:25.740> just<00:01:26.280> so<00:01:26.520> damn<00:01:26.759> strong<00:01:27.180> so

let's hope this is true but you know the

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.780 
let's hope this is true but you know the
