hi<00:00:30.560> let's<00:00:31.070> talk<00:00:31.250> about<00:00:31.400> my<00:00:31.700> organ<00:00:32.150> petals<00:00:32.509> that

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:32.599 
hi let's talk about my organ petals that

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.650 
hi let's talk about my organ petals that
I've<00:00:32.930> started<00:00:33.290> to<00:00:33.470> talk<00:00:33.620> early<00:00:33.980> this<00:00:34.130> year<00:00:34.660> now

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
I've started to talk early this year now

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.080 
I've started to talk early this year now
they<00:00:36.260> are<00:00:36.440> some<00:00:36.770> kind<00:00:37.040> of<00:00:37.160> finish<00:00:37.640> right<00:00:37.880> now

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:38.090 
they are some kind of finish right now

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.200 
they are some kind of finish right now
I'm<00:00:38.530> happy<00:00:39.530> with<00:00:40.040> the<00:00:40.820> outcome<00:00:41.330> more<00:00:42.290> or<00:00:42.440> less

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.210 
I'm happy with the outcome more or less

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.540 
I'm happy with the outcome more or less
there's<00:00:44.210> always<00:00:44.450> things<00:00:45.290> you<00:00:45.440> can<00:00:45.710> build<00:00:45.920> you

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
there's always things you can build you

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:47.439 
there's always things you can build you
can<00:00:46.730> do<00:00:46.850> better

00:00:47.439 --> 00:00:47.449 
can do better

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:49.479 
can do better
I<00:00:47.480> have<00:00:48.020> suspended<00:00:48.440> this<00:00:48.680> project<00:00:49.190> for<00:00:49.340> almost

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
I have suspended this project for almost

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:52.119 
I have suspended this project for almost
half<00:00:49.850> a<00:00:49.970> year<00:00:50.000> because<00:00:50.590> yeah<00:00:51.590> I<00:00:51.620> built<00:00:51.920> this

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 
half a year because yeah I built this

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:56.490 
half a year because yeah I built this
lab<00:00:52.400> and<00:00:52.730> many<00:00:53.600> other<00:00:53.870> stuff<00:00:54.260> came<00:00:54.710> up<00:00:55.129> and<00:00:55.580> I

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.500 
lab and many other stuff came up and I

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.009 
lab and many other stuff came up and I
like<00:00:57.500> to<00:00:57.830> experiment<00:00:58.520> with<00:00:58.970> new<00:00:59.239> stuff<00:00:59.600> there

00:01:00.009 --> 00:01:00.019 
like to experiment with new stuff there

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:05.170 
like to experiment with new stuff there
and<00:01:01.180> but<00:01:02.180> I<00:01:02.780> really<00:01:03.680> like<00:01:03.890> to<00:01:04.190> finish<00:01:04.430> this<00:01:04.610> one

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
and but I really like to finish this one

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.160 
and but I really like to finish this one
big<00:01:05.420> project<00:01:06.020> which<00:01:06.229> was<00:01:06.680> the<00:01:06.920> initial<00:01:07.220> one

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
big project which was the initial one

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.080 
big project which was the initial one
that<00:01:09.170> I<00:01:09.320> started<00:01:09.380> with<00:01:10.040> all<00:01:10.070> this<00:01:10.369> electronics

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
that I started with all this electronics

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:17.730 
that I started with all this electronics
so<00:01:13.360> yeah<00:01:14.360> I<00:01:14.740> got<00:01:15.740> my<00:01:15.950> guts<00:01:16.310> together<00:01:16.790> and

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
so yeah I got my guts together and

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.790 
so yeah I got my guts together and
transferred<00:01:18.740> to<00:01:18.920> the<00:01:19.070> breadboard<00:01:19.720> to<00:01:20.800> actual

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
transferred to the breadboard to actual

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.960 
transferred to the breadboard to actual
PCBs<00:01:22.310> I<00:01:22.840> had<00:01:23.840> already<00:01:24.220> one<00:01:25.220> version<00:01:25.700> of<00:01:25.820> the

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
PCBs I had already one version of the

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.350 
PCBs I had already one version of the
multiplexer<00:01:26.750> board<00:01:27.320> which<00:01:28.090> was<00:01:29.619> 3/8<00:01:30.619> channel

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
multiplexer board which was 3/8 channel

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.150 
multiplexer board which was 3/8 channel
multiplexers<00:01:32.360> and<00:01:33.110> a<00:01:33.200> lot<00:01:33.350> multiplexers

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:34.160 
multiplexers and a lot multiplexers

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.279 
multiplexers and a lot multiplexers
connected<00:01:34.759> together<00:01:34.910> in<00:01:35.420> some<00:01:35.630> kind<00:01:35.660> of<00:01:35.929> tree

00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:36.289 
connected together in some kind of tree

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:39.430 
connected together in some kind of tree
this<00:01:36.560> is<00:01:36.709> the<00:01:36.860> first<00:01:37.640> birthday<00:01:37.970> I<00:01:38.660> was<00:01:39.170> itching

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
this is the first birthday I was itching

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.290 
this is the first birthday I was itching
and<00:01:40.270> yeah<00:01:41.270> it's<00:01:42.140> all<00:01:42.530> ready<00:01:42.740> and<00:01:43.300> two-sided

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
and yeah it's all ready and two-sided

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.730 
and yeah it's all ready and two-sided
and<00:01:45.550> yeah<00:01:46.550> it's<00:01:46.789> not<00:01:46.910> so<00:01:47.360> clean<00:01:47.780> it's<00:01:48.259> not<00:01:48.500> so

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
and yeah it's not so clean it's not so

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.240 
and yeah it's not so clean it's not so
clean<00:01:49.009> below<00:01:49.849> the<00:01:50.240> chips<00:01:50.539> so<00:01:50.720> I<00:01:50.929> I<00:01:51.440> wasn't<00:01:52.009> able

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
clean below the chips so I I wasn't able

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.969 
clean below the chips so I I wasn't able
to<00:01:52.610> get<00:01:53.450> this<00:01:53.720> really<00:01:54.140> running<00:01:54.380> there<00:01:54.890> are

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
to get this really running there are

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.300 
to get this really running there are
some<00:01:55.220> thoughts<00:01:55.520> on<00:01:55.819> this<00:01:55.970> board<00:01:56.420> and

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
some thoughts on this board and

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.290 
some thoughts on this board and
connectors<00:01:58.310> suck<00:01:58.970> and<00:01:59.800> yeah<00:02:00.800> I'm<00:02:01.039> it's<00:02:02.000> it's

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
connectors suck and yeah I'm it's it's

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.339 
connectors suck and yeah I'm it's it's
really<00:02:03.289> nice<00:02:03.590> but<00:02:04.069> it<00:02:04.459> doesn't<00:02:05.060> work<00:02:05.300> so<00:02:05.780> this

00:02:06.339 --> 00:02:06.349 
really nice but it doesn't work so this

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:09.600 
really nice but it doesn't work so this
was<00:02:06.590> this<00:02:07.550> really<00:02:07.819> didn<00:02:08.300> t<00:02:08.539> motivated<00:02:09.229> me<00:02:09.470> to

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
was this really didn t motivated me to

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:16.030 
was this really didn t motivated me to
continue<00:02:12.069> doing<00:02:13.069> this<00:02:13.340> and<00:02:14.020> so<00:02:15.020> I<00:02:15.050> just<00:02:15.560> pushed

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
continue doing this and so I just pushed

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.610 
continue doing this and so I just pushed
it<00:02:16.220> as<00:02:16.400> to<00:02:16.970> the<00:02:17.090> side<00:02:17.390> and<00:02:17.750> started<00:02:18.380> doing

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
it as to the side and started doing

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.710 
it as to the side and started doing
other<00:02:18.770> stuff<00:02:18.920> it's<00:02:19.430> quite<00:02:19.760> complicated<00:02:20.180> as

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
other stuff it's quite complicated as

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.910 
other stuff it's quite complicated as
you<00:02:20.750> can<00:02:21.080> see<00:02:22.270> but<00:02:23.270> this<00:02:24.050> wasn't<00:02:24.410> the<00:02:24.650> best

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
you can see but this wasn't the best

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.970 
you can see but this wasn't the best
solution<00:02:25.520> I<00:02:25.790> have<00:02:26.150> already<00:02:26.750> a<00:02:26.840> multiplexer<00:02:27.770> in

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
solution I have already a multiplexer in

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:36.580 
solution I have already a multiplexer in
the<00:02:28.220> ship<00:02:28.489> since<00:02:28.880> I<00:02:29.060> used<00:02:32.950> 18<00:02:33.950> mega<00:02:34.810> ship<00:02:35.810> there

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
the ship since I used 18 mega ship there

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.690 
the ship since I used 18 mega ship there
is<00:02:36.739> a<00:02:36.770> multiplexer<00:02:37.700> in<00:02:37.819> place<00:02:38.150> so<00:02:38.980> why<00:02:39.980> the

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
is a multiplexer in place so why the

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.430 
is a multiplexer in place so why the
hell<00:02:40.969> did<00:02:41.329> I<00:02:41.480> use

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
hell did I use

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.550 
hell did I use
some<00:02:42.710> kind<00:02:42.980> of<00:02:43.130> tree<00:02:43.600> instead<00:02:44.600> just<00:02:45.050> using

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
some kind of tree instead just using

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.300 
some kind of tree instead just using
three<00:02:45.920> channels<00:02:46.720> each<00:02:47.720> channel<00:02:48.530> for<00:02:48.830> one<00:02:49.070> of

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
three channels each channel for one of

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.500 
three channels each channel for one of
this<00:02:50.030> 8-bit<00:02:50.360> chips<00:02:51.050> and<00:02:51.320> get<00:02:52.010> all<00:02:52.310> the<00:02:52.880> 24

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
this 8-bit chips and get all the 24

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.860 
this 8-bit chips and get all the 24
channels<00:02:54.230> here<00:02:54.560> with<00:02:55.190> straight<00:02:56.060> connections

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
channels here with straight connections

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:04.600 
channels here with straight connections
and<00:02:57.550> no<00:02:58.550> trees<00:02:59.000> no<00:03:00.130> fancy<00:03:01.130> stuff<00:03:02.410> here<00:03:03.410> so<00:03:04.130> it

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
and no trees no fancy stuff here so it

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.420 
and no trees no fancy stuff here so it
got<00:03:05.000> really<00:03:05.470> simpler<00:03:06.470> and<00:03:06.680> I<00:03:06.860> got<00:03:07.100> all<00:03:07.280> the

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
got really simpler and I got all the

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.230 
got really simpler and I got all the
practice<00:03:08.030> from<00:03:08.840> the<00:03:09.560> half<00:03:10.100> half<00:03:10.610> of<00:03:10.820> the<00:03:10.940> year

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:11.240 
practice from the half half of the year

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.950 
practice from the half half of the year
I<00:03:11.830> experimented<00:03:12.830> with<00:03:13.070> the<00:03:13.760> other<00:03:13.970> edging<00:03:14.690> and

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:14.960 
I experimented with the other edging and

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:19.270 
I experimented with the other edging and
so<00:03:15.170> on<00:03:15.340> so<00:03:16.340> it<00:03:17.120> worked<00:03:17.510> well<00:03:17.870> and<00:03:18.140> now<00:03:18.500> and<00:03:18.800> as

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
so on so it worked well and now and as

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.410 
so on so it worked well and now and as
you<00:03:19.490> can<00:03:19.730> see<00:03:20.030> it's<00:03:20.810> it's<00:03:21.200> finished<00:03:22.120> all<00:03:23.120> the

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
you can see it's it's finished all the

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.320 
you can see it's it's finished all the
boards<00:03:23.840> are<00:03:24.140> down<00:03:24.470> here<00:03:24.950> as<00:03:25.520> you<00:03:25.670> can<00:03:25.730> see<00:03:25.880> this

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
boards are down here as you can see this

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:31.780 
boards are down here as you can see this
is<00:03:26.480> the<00:03:27.020> new<00:03:27.200> multiplexer<00:03:28.010> board<00:03:28.280> and<00:03:30.670> this<00:03:31.670> is

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
is the new multiplexer board and this is

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.590 
is the new multiplexer board and this is
the<00:03:31.940> main<00:03:32.180> board<00:03:32.570> and<00:03:33.460> yeah<00:03:34.460> this<00:03:34.820> is<00:03:34.940> the

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
the main board and yeah this is the

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.240 
the main board and yeah this is the
display<00:03:36.100> which<00:03:37.100> was<00:03:37.810> the<00:03:38.810> first<00:03:39.140> thing<00:03:39.680> I<00:03:39.980> have

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
display which was the first thing I have

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.690 
display which was the first thing I have
saw<00:03:41.150> that<00:03:41.360> here<00:03:41.600> this<00:03:41.870> isn't<00:03:42.050> even<00:03:42.590> let<00:03:43.340> free

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
saw that here this isn't even let free

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.840 
saw that here this isn't even let free
so<00:03:44.000> I<00:03:44.560> this<00:03:45.560> is<00:03:45.710> this<00:03:45.950> would<00:03:46.130> be<00:03:46.340> the<00:03:46.520> first

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
so I this is this would be the first

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.970 
so I this is this would be the first
thing<00:03:47.120> I<00:03:47.360> did<00:03:47.720> I<00:03:47.840> were<00:03:48.020> to<00:03:48.170> replace<00:03:48.560> it's<00:03:48.890> a

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
thing I did I were to replace it's a

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.990 
thing I did I were to replace it's a
true<00:03:49.400> hole<00:03:49.640> and<00:03:49.970> yeah<00:03:50.830> okay<00:03:51.830> some<00:03:52.610> kind<00:03:52.880> of

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
true hole and yeah okay some kind of

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.790 
true hole and yeah okay some kind of
prototype<00:03:53.480> but<00:03:54.380> it<00:03:54.560> works<00:03:54.860> so<00:03:55.989> it<00:03:56.989> was

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800 
prototype but it works so it was

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.010 
prototype but it works so it was
sufficient<00:03:58.400> you<00:03:58.760> can<00:03:58.970> see<00:03:59.270> on<00:03:59.480> them<00:03:59.690> on<00:03:59.840> the

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:00.020 
sufficient you can see on them on the

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:03.550 
sufficient you can see on them on the
display<00:04:00.290> the<00:04:00.680> value<00:04:01.220> that's<00:04:02.209> the<00:04:02.480> how<00:04:03.050> effect

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
display the value that's the how effect

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:09.490 
display the value that's the how effect
sensor<00:04:04.100> is<00:04:04.280> measuring<00:04:04.910> there<00:04:07.000> so<00:04:08.380> this<00:04:09.380> is

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
sensor is measuring there so this is

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.710 
sensor is measuring there so this is
totally<00:04:09.920> capable<00:04:10.160> of<00:04:10.670> measuring<00:04:11.300> velocity

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
totally capable of measuring velocity

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.820 
totally capable of measuring velocity
and<00:04:12.470> aftertouch<00:04:13.370> even<00:04:13.880> though<00:04:14.470> it's<00:04:15.470> really

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 
and aftertouch even though it's really

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.150 
and aftertouch even though it's really
unusual<00:04:16.130> and<00:04:16.880> not<00:04:17.299> existent<00:04:18.049> and<00:04:18.260> present

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
unusual and not existent and present

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.010 
unusual and not existent and present
pedals<00:04:19.970> or<00:04:20.890> real<00:04:21.890> organ<00:04:22.460> but<00:04:22.700> you<00:04:23.300> can<00:04:23.510> use<00:04:23.810> it

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
pedals or real organ but you can use it

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.500 
pedals or real organ but you can use it
for<00:04:24.230> more<00:04:24.440> than<00:04:24.500> just<00:04:24.770> organ<00:04:25.640> playing<00:04:26.030> you<00:04:26.330> can

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
for more than just organ playing you can

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.200 
for more than just organ playing you can
use<00:04:26.660> it<00:04:26.840> for<00:04:27.020> anything

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
use it for anything

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.890 
use it for anything
this<00:04:29.210> was<00:04:29.360> my<00:04:29.540> initial<00:04:30.050> plan<00:04:30.230> to<00:04:30.650> create<00:04:31.900> organ

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
this was my initial plan to create organ

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.100 
this was my initial plan to create organ
pedals<00:04:33.350> which<00:04:34.100> are<00:04:34.400> more<00:04:35.240> than<00:04:35.300> just<00:04:35.510> organ

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
pedals which are more than just organ

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.140 
pedals which are more than just organ
pedals<00:04:36.500> they<00:04:36.680> can<00:04:36.919> be<00:04:37.070> used<00:04:37.280> for<00:04:37.490> anything<00:04:37.790> you

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
pedals they can be used for anything you

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.780 
pedals they can be used for anything you
can<00:04:38.390> just<00:04:38.419> you<00:04:39.260> can<00:04:39.470> use<00:04:39.800> the<00:04:40.040> media<00:04:40.190> interface

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
can just you can use the media interface

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:45.250 
can just you can use the media interface
to<00:04:41.380> yeah<00:04:42.669> to<00:04:43.669> assign<00:04:44.030> some<00:04:44.390> samples<00:04:44.930> or

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
to yeah to assign some samples or
