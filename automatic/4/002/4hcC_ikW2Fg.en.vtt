makes<00:02:33.220> explicit<00:02:33.700> what<00:02:34.030> most<00:02:34.240> of<00:02:34.420> us<00:02:34.510> already

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
makes explicit what most of us already

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.560 
makes explicit what most of us already
know<00:02:35.320> and<00:02:35.620> it<00:02:36.160> gives<00:02:36.370> us<00:02:36.520> a<00:02:36.670> framework<00:02:36.910> in

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:37.570 
know and it gives us a framework in

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.450 
know and it gives us a framework in
which<00:02:37.600> things<00:02:38.170> aren't<00:02:38.440> going<00:02:38.770> well<00:02:38.800> I<00:02:39.160> have<00:02:39.400> a

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.460 
which things aren't going well I have a

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.330 
which things aren't going well I have a
place<00:02:39.730> to<00:02:40.000> look<00:02:40.150> I<00:02:40.480> can<00:02:41.410> and<00:02:41.680> so<00:02:41.920> it's<00:02:42.190> a

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
place to look I can and so it's a

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.510 
place to look I can and so it's a
learning<00:02:42.610> device<00:02:42.940> and<00:02:43.980> and<00:02:44.980> it's<00:02:45.190> a<00:02:45.280> highly

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
learning device and and it's a highly

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.630 
learning device and and it's a highly
experiential<00:02:46.330> process<00:02:46.960> which<00:02:47.740> means<00:02:48.100> that<00:02:48.430> in

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
experiential process which means that in

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.670 
experiential process which means that in
the<00:02:48.820> workshop<00:02:49.300> I'm<00:02:49.510> actually<00:02:49.900> doing<00:02:50.350> the<00:02:50.500> work

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
the workshop I'm actually doing the work

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.070 
the workshop I'm actually doing the work
it's<00:02:50.980> not<00:02:51.190> just<00:02:51.520> theory<00:02:51.790> but<00:02:52.480> it's<00:02:52.660> organized

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
it's not just theory but it's organized

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.710 
it's not just theory but it's organized
around<00:02:53.290> practice<00:02:54.010> and<00:02:54.280> so<00:02:54.730> the<00:02:54.970> fast<00:02:55.270> way<00:02:55.690> to

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
around practice and so the fast way to

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.630 
around practice and so the fast way to
get<00:02:55.990> connected<00:02:56.590> is<00:02:56.710> to<00:02:56.830> say<00:02:57.010> how<00:02:57.100> do<00:02:57.160> you<00:02:57.310> feel

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
get connected is to say how do you feel

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
get connected is to say how do you feel

before<00:03:18.010> I<00:03:18.040> collect<00:03:18.970> data<00:03:19.710> then<00:03:20.710> it<00:03:20.950> helps<00:03:21.370> me

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
before I collect data then it helps me

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.880 
before I collect data then it helps me
keep<00:03:21.910> the<00:03:22.210> structure<00:03:22.720> so<00:03:22.930> it<00:03:23.020> makes<00:03:23.260> explicit

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
keep the structure so it makes explicit

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.360 
keep the structure so it makes explicit
a<00:03:24.340> structure<00:03:25.150> for<00:03:25.630> being<00:03:25.870> powerful<00:03:26.350> when<00:03:27.250> you

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
a structure for being powerful when you

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.780 
a structure for being powerful when you
don't<00:03:27.610> have<00:03:27.880> direct<00:03:28.120> line<00:03:28.570> Authority<00:03:29.790> clients

going on it means got people's attention

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.220 
going on it means got people's attention
it<00:05:12.490> means<00:05:12.670> you're<00:05:12.790> touching<00:05:13.180> things<00:05:13.450> that<00:05:14.110> are

there's<00:05:49.150> a<00:05:49.210> lot<00:05:49.420> of<00:05:49.450> warning<00:05:50.080> signs<00:05:50.440> that<00:05:50.800> you

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:51.130 
there's a lot of warning signs that you

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:54.060 
there's a lot of warning signs that you
kind<00:05:51.700> of<00:05:51.790> make<00:05:52.570> explicit<00:05:53.260> and<00:05:53.410> give<00:05:53.560> order<00:05:53.890> too

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.070 
kind of make explicit and give order too

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:57.300 
kind of make explicit and give order too
and<00:05:54.430> so<00:05:55.060> I<00:05:55.090> don't<00:05:55.330> care<00:05:55.750> how<00:05:55.990> high<00:05:56.500> they<00:05:56.800> are<00:05:56.830> or

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
and so I don't care how high they are or

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.460 
and so I don't care how high they are or
how<00:05:57.490> frightening<00:05:58.060> they<00:05:58.420> are<00:05:58.630> how<00:05:58.930> this<00:05:59.260> or

00:05:59.460 --> 00:05:59.470 
how frightening they are how this or

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:02.190 
how frightening they are how this or
whatever<00:05:59.650> your<00:05:59.950> story<00:06:00.220> is<00:06:00.490> about<00:06:00.670> them<00:06:01.120> at<00:06:01.960> the

your life this is how you authored

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.230 
your life this is how you authored
Eckler<00:06:16.360> ation<00:06:16.660> of<00:06:16.810> what<00:06:16.990> so<00:06:17.260> that<00:06:17.410> in<00:06:17.970> the<00:06:18.970> sane

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:19.240 
Eckler ation of what so that in the sane

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.840 
Eckler ation of what so that in the sane
of<00:06:19.510> them<00:06:19.660> is<00:06:19.810> enormous<00:06:20.310> meaning<00:06:21.310> to<00:06:21.460> that<00:06:21.640> and

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:21.850 
of them is enormous meaning to that and

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:25.470 
of them is enormous meaning to that and
you're<00:06:22.630> also<00:06:22.840> teaching<00:06:23.740> your<00:06:24.010> client<00:06:24.550> talking

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:25.480 
you're also teaching your client talking

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:27.150 
you're also teaching your client talking
to<00:06:25.780> each<00:06:25.930> other<00:06:26.170> about<00:06:26.320> what<00:06:26.620> you<00:06:26.770> want<00:06:27.010> from

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:27.160 
to each other about what you want from

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.650 
to each other about what you want from
each<00:06:27.310> other<00:06:27.550> it's<00:06:27.730> how<00:06:27.880> the<00:06:27.940> future<00:06:28.300> gets

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:28.660 
each other it's how the future gets

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.510 
each other it's how the future gets
created<00:06:29.320> there's<00:06:29.890> probably<00:06:30.310> a<00:06:30.400> hundred

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:30.520 
created there's probably a hundred

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:31.830 
created there's probably a hundred
thousand<00:06:31.120> people<00:06:31.270> that<00:06:31.570> have<00:06:31.660> been<00:06:31.780> through

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:31.840 
thousand people that have been through

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.170 
thousand people that have been through
this<00:06:32.140> workshop<00:06:32.620> and<00:06:32.860> so<00:06:33.340> the<00:06:33.550> design<00:06:33.940> is

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:34.180 
this workshop and so the design is

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.820 
this workshop and so the design is
pretty<00:06:35.050> well<00:06:35.370> we<00:06:36.370> know<00:06:36.520> that<00:06:36.729> it<00:06:36.850> works

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:37.830 
pretty well we know that it works

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:40.430 
pretty well we know that it works
and<00:06:37.919> it's<00:06:38.430> just<00:06:38.610> endured<00:06:39.240> over<00:06:40.020> a<00:06:40.050> large

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:40.440 
and it's just endured over a large

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.680 
and it's just endured over a large
number<00:06:40.560> of<00:06:41.009> years<00:06:41.550> because<00:06:41.819> it<00:06:42.270> deals<00:06:42.509> with

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:42.690 
number of years because it deals with

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:44.990 
number of years because it deals with
something<00:06:43.199> more<00:06:43.680> fundamental<00:06:44.039> than<00:06:44.699> just<00:06:44.879> a

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:45.000 
something more fundamental than just a

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.159 
something more fundamental than just a
framework<00:06:45.300> of<00:06:45.629> how<00:06:45.690> to<00:06:45.840> think<00:06:45.930> about

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:46.169 
framework of how to think about

00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:49.309 
framework of how to think about
consulting<00:06:46.710> it<00:06:47.610> says<00:06:47.909> the<00:06:48.090> person<00:06:48.449> is<00:06:48.840> the

00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:49.319 
consulting it says the person is the

00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:51.950 
consulting it says the person is the
product<00:06:49.800> and<00:06:50.069> so<00:06:50.819> people<00:06:51.569> who<00:06:51.690> go<00:06:51.930> through

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:51.960 
product and so people who go through

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.869 
product and so people who go through
this<00:06:52.319> workshop<00:06:52.800> learn<00:06:53.099> something<00:06:53.490> important

00:06:53.869 --> 00:06:53.879 
this workshop learn something important

00:06:53.879 --> 00:06:55.670 
this workshop learn something important
about<00:06:54.120> themselves<00:06:54.569> it's<00:06:54.870> much<00:06:55.080> broader<00:06:55.409> than

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:55.680 
about themselves it's much broader than

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.219 
about themselves it's much broader than
just<00:06:55.949> their<00:06:56.159> role<00:06:56.460> as<00:06:56.789> a<00:06:56.849> staff<00:06:57.569> person<00:06:58.110> or

00:06:58.219 --> 00:06:58.229 
just their role as a staff person or

00:06:58.229 --> 00:07:00.860 
just their role as a staff person or
consultant
