 the message that they go to the actual activities and you have to 

00:00:26.889 --> 00:00:29.239
 to do it well, that is 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:31.969
 if she has hung the heart of, for example, it stops responding 

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:36.670

 pull it off 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.370

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.090
