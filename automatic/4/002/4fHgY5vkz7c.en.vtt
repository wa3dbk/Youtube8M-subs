00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
speechless trail you can even make

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.199 
speechless trail you can even make
portions<00:02:20.140> explosions<00:02:20.680> is<00:02:20.830> a<00:02:20.860> very<00:02:21.430> big<00:02:21.970> part

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
portions explosions is a very big part

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:23.760 
portions explosions is a very big part
of<00:02:22.360> this<00:02:22.510> because<00:02:22.810> you<00:02:22.900> could<00:02:23.080> you<00:02:23.470> need<00:02:23.620> to

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
of this because you could you need to

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.410 
of this because you could you need to
get<00:02:23.920> restoration<00:02:24.550> at<00:02:24.820> fight<00:02:25.180> fire

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
get restoration at fight fire

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.540 
get restoration at fight fire
restoration<00:02:25.570> portions<00:02:26.230> like<00:02:26.410> that<00:02:26.650> then<00:02:27.430> you

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
restoration portions like that then you

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.370 
restoration portions like that then you
can<00:02:27.580> mix<00:02:27.880> myth<00:02:28.209> in<00:02:28.360> ones<00:02:28.570> then<00:02:28.930> you<00:02:29.020> can<00:02:29.170> make

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
can mix myth in ones then you can make

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.820 
can mix myth in ones then you can make
your<00:02:29.770> armor<00:02:30.670> like<00:02:30.880> that<00:02:31.470> but<00:02:32.470> you<00:02:32.530> can<00:02:32.680> also

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
your armor like that but you can also

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.360 
your armor like that but you can also
make<00:02:33.160> a<00:02:33.400> portion<00:02:33.880> where<00:02:34.090> it's<00:02:34.300> like<00:02:35.370> stupid

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
make a portion where it's like stupid

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.990 
make a portion where it's like stupid
amount<00:02:37.080> better<00:02:38.100> speech<00:02:39.100> but<00:02:39.430> bartering<00:02:39.850> with

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
amount better speech but bartering with

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.940 
amount better speech but bartering with
people<00:02:40.540> so<00:02:40.660> you<00:02:40.750> get<00:02:40.870> better<00:02:41.050> prices<00:02:41.650> so<00:02:41.890> you

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
people so you get better prices so you

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.190 
people so you get better prices so you
get<00:02:42.130> better<00:02:42.370> so<00:02:42.940> your<00:02:43.090> skill<00:02:43.360> increases<00:02:43.510> so
