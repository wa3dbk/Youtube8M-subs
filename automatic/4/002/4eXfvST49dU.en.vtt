00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:01.320

 to skate 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.049

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:17.830
 to tell the truth you read not 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.990
 beautiful this tyrrhenian the planet is 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:26.869
 simple oversight on the other side 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.610
 I surely know of one too 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.670
 season that dear knows how to have also been 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.649
 constantly at the beginning then now 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.440
 I saw him practice well try 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:37.450
 really all the way 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.350
 the result that the positive period a 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.200
 cause of events 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.729
 carol an ambitious program with a 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.299
 double azzia practically silvia 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:49.520
 of the program quite safe in 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:53.180
 training also in the book in fact 2 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:56.630
 in the second half then the difficulties 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:59.450
 to make it quite simple even if there 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:02.060
 laughs sorry for the resistance a game 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.799
 made of fatigue so sure enough 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.690
 easy to fold the 2 who wants 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:08.060
 know other media from now we know that 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.039
 you are already wearing well in bolzano 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.360
 yes yes I was born in Bolzano 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:15.730
 I train 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:18.440
 yes of course I started 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.350
 every fact later started to nine years 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.960
 skating by chance I say to myself 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.580
 go and try with the enemy since then 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:28.630
 first-rate parties 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.630
 in love with this sport 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.310
 shape a city 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:38.170
 it seems that ago I met Lorenzo is 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:42.159
 improved the really fall 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.810
 to do results at 300 for something 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:45.370
 and I came up with something that is not 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.499
 I never thought until recently 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.900
 he started as a game and that's it 

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:55.389
 we have a dream come true 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:56.889
 everyone's really was also 

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:59.109
 when he told me I was attending 

00:02:56.889 --> 00:03:01.940
 I almost didn't believe it, we are 

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:03.860
 tv parties that we were here 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.080
 in short, everything was fantastic 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.930
 really how much we have in crisis 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.540
 realized relief or anyone but not yes 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:15.230
 they make a monk looking at us in the face and 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:17.000
 of dinners I'm leaving for the patient 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.070
 of contini does not seem true that we are 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:24.710
 great beating because it happened to us 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:28.220
 he is so happy because we children have 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:29.900
 said we were never perfect because 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.110
 believe me it's great to be here at 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.510
 tell the viewers 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:37.420
 emotions to bring our players 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.190
 here inside the bar biden and then 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.840
 that's why we always want to have too 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.090
 athletes thank you because also 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.860
 for those who detach from excuse me in the meantime 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.740
 he questioned why there is a big return 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.130
 obviously attracted and is that of yu na 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.980
 kim 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:53.140
 look really amazing me 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.480
 lorenzo before saying goodbye I wanted to tell you 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.520
 there are some possibilities to pass 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:02.020
 to the second part of the competition we remember 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:03.700
 only 24 of the 35 go then to say 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:05.500
 the truth will depend a lot on how they do it 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.020
 other athletes who are now 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.520
 on the track 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.700
 we say that in my opinion hamsik in a 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.650
 lottery 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.379
 and defends so much from the tension from the 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.450
 ability to do things that earthquake that 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:19.609
 we know how to do it is not exactly said that 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.359
 also come in this instant and therefore 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:21.650
 I 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.580
 here we are just crosses our fingers but 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.980
 let's say we are extremely 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.080
 satisfied with what everyone acquitted 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.520
 of how he skated so anyway 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.700
 go it already is successfully 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:34.479
 broken ice regatta to say thank you 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:37.310
 thank you very much thank you then 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:40.220
 let's go back to the commentary because 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.510
 obviously there is a very important group 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:46.450
 I must say that today this is beautiful 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:49.400
 race because there is always a skater 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:51.470
 important in any burning accident 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.590
 obviously because we know that the mount of 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:56.720
 a team had no disputed children 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.370
 become my absurd lip because ever 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.470
 this having not competed for two 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.960
 years later also having the known carol 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:05.389
 bressanutti really was interesting 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.370
 go to follow these first groups not 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:09.290
 frank goal that those who do not duo in the breeze 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.580
 multine to the second group now you have one 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:13.010
 blow development should always be 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:15.979
 so let's integrate some scam what we do 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:17.800
 always keeps the song awake 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:19.910
 we're just looking at it then 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.590
 naturally great respect for all 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.720
 the pages actresses therefore to the lines 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.520
 journey will be the first category go down 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:28.910
 on the journey then the German natalie goes into 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:32.210
 via yu na kim cartoons also monica ci 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:34.070
 missing cova and cat but of course banal 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:37.720
 I want franca to make it there 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.720
 comment on what he is doing 

00:05:38.249 --> 00:05:44.219
 I'm not wrong a comma for now I did 

00:05:42.209 --> 00:05:47.669
 the triple plus luxury combination tolu 

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:51.029
 twice twice perfect made two 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:53.330
 twice perfect squares I have not yet 

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:56.840
 saw the fried I think that 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:59.569
 go there now has not done in the beginning 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:01.389
 when I was a little distracted by that 

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:03.590
 you talked to each other just watching 

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:08.030
 let's see what is going to do 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:13.789
 now you see it comes now it causes that 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:17.639
 precede the little one 

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:18.659
 very last as an incredible workout 

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:20.159
 in the meantime we see it with water 

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:21.719
 now also framed by cameras 

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:23.720
 of Canadian television but really 

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:26.030
 believe you made us vein 

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.470
 I tell them the same incredible over time 

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:31.580
 and as we say all the rights to 

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:33.170
 go so fast but even here is not a 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:36.830
 little talk that we do very often 

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:39.890
 for carolina it is not so much then the tender 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:41.070
 the jump or not and the quality the many 

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:42.230
 why 

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:44.270
 no 

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:46.090
 this triple lutz triple toe there and ce 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:48.310
 we have it here 

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:50.199
 then it takes up a third of track 

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:54.910
 therefore it has a size a size 

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:57.210
 but smoothness that go to the level of 

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:58.400
 quality goes to florence 

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:01.440
 are worth 

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:04.800
 time much much 

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:06.540
 a yuna kim did in the tests but 

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:08.670
 we are sure that today he will be able to give the 

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:13.200
 better than herself much is closed in 

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:16.110
 his bubble therefore reflective when he has 

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:18.180
 found as if you wanted some also 

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:20.100
 foreigners from all the rest also because 

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:21.870
 believe us there is the Korean press that 

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:24.480
 pursues but not only 

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:25.890
 the fans waiting for her and I have to say 

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:28.500
 she was very pretty during 

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:31.470
 workouts feels stop signing 

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:34.830
 autographs to let us take pictures do it 

00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:35.910
 as you can see very pretty 

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:38.820
 available 

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:40.200
 of course she also feels the weight of his 

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:41.760
 I return all those waiting 

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:44.430
 obviously his return of wind that 

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:49.350
 she burned your bad return 

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:51.430
 at the races that will surely see it 

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:53.140
 committed 

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:54.850
 and then for the debut of his new ones 

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:56.410
 programs instead chose a lot from the garden 

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:58.800
 on average he dominated without problems 

00:07:56.410 --> 00:08:01.570
 frank yes did not have absolutely 

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:04.090
 problem to dominate indeed has made of 

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:06.400
 impressive syntheses in both 

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:07.420
 be short than in the more in the short than 

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:10.600
 in the free 

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:12.780
 actually i was thinking just that 

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:15.660
 I believe that today 

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:18.139
 I hope everything goes as it should but 

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:18.139
 no one knows
