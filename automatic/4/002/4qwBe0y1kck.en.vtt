so on so that's one of our theories as

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.140 
so on so that's one of our theories as
to<00:01:15.990> I'd<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.560> stock<00:01:16.799> this<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:17.460> happening<00:01:17.790> also

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
to I'd the stock this is happening also

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.510 
to I'd the stock this is happening also
I<00:01:18.180> think<00:01:18.299> players<00:01:18.659> are<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:18.990> come<00:01:19.740> like<00:01:20.250> they're

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
I think players are to come like they're

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.520 
I think players are to come like they're
comfy<00:01:20.820> in<00:01:20.909> their<00:01:21.030> position<00:01:21.380> Fabregas<00:01:22.380> he

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
comfy in their position Fabregas he

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.620 
comfy in their position Fabregas he
knows<00:01:22.770> marina<00:01:23.460> won't<00:01:23.610> drop<00:01:23.759> him<00:01:23.939> unless<00:01:24.570> we

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
knows marina won't drop him unless we

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.240 
knows marina won't drop him unless we
get<00:01:24.869> pop<00:01:25.110> bottle<00:01:25.409> wits<00:01:25.590> or<00:01:25.710> someone<00:01:26.159> who

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
get pop bottle wits or someone who

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.590 
get pop bottle wits or someone who
someone<00:01:26.670> who's<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:26.790> box-to-box<00:01:27.060> back<00:01:27.390> was

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
someone who's a box-to-box back was

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.810 
someone who's a box-to-box back was
hereit<00:01:27.900> he<00:01:28.320> thinks<00:01:28.650> that<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:29.400> best<00:01:29.610> position

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
hereit he thinks that the best position

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.429 
hereit he thinks that the best position
for<00:01:30.060> Fabregas<00:01:30.570> is<00:01:30.630> in<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:30.960> pivot<00:01:31.229> alongside

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
for Fabregas is in the pivot alongside

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.679 
for Fabregas is in the pivot alongside
matty<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.159> he<00:01:32.460> won't<00:01:32.790> be<00:01:33.060> dropped<00:01:33.299> like<00:01:33.540> you

can<00:01:33.840> just<00:01:33.869> imagine<00:01:34.110> Fabregas<00:01:34.619> like<00:01:34.829> he<00:01:35.579> hasn't

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
can just imagine Fabregas like he hasn't

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.340 
can just imagine Fabregas like he hasn't
started<00:01:36.090> well<00:01:36.329> but<00:01:36.540> he<00:01:36.659> knows<00:01:36.869> he<00:01:37.079> was<00:01:37.170> taught

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
started well but he knows he was taught

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.810 
started well but he knows he was taught
he<00:01:37.829> knows<00:01:38.040> who<00:01:38.159> stops<00:01:38.460> where's<00:01:38.700> the

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
he knows who stops where's the

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.910 
he knows who stops where's the

competition where's the squad depth for
the<00:01:41.070> team<00:01:41.250> I<00:01:42.240> think<00:01:42.720> I'll<00:01:42.780> brightest<00:01:43.110> spark

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
the team I think I'll brightest spark

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.580 
the team I think I'll brightest spark
was<00:01:43.560> Kennedy<00:01:43.920> on<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.909> left<00:01:45.270> wing<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.720> I<00:01:46.380> think

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
was Kennedy on the left wing and I think

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.020 
was Kennedy on the left wing and I think
he<00:01:46.649> was<00:01:46.770> brilliant<00:01:46.950> that<00:01:47.340> he<00:01:47.460> came<00:01:47.610> on<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:47.970> the

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
he was brilliant that he came on and the

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.700 
he was brilliant that he came on and the
reason<00:01:48.780> him<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.110> lost<00:01:49.229> her<00:01:49.320> sheep<00:01:49.500> they'd

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
reason him and lost her sheep they'd

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:50.569 
reason him and lost her sheep they'd
roll<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:49.950> was<00:01:50.040> cuz<00:01:50.220> they<00:01:50.280> had<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.460> prove

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
roll it was cuz they had to prove

paid off I think loster she can be
breathing<00:02:01.770> for<00:02:01.920> us<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.689> marinas<00:02:03.689> promise<00:02:03.990> was

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
not willing to pay up to 40 I know

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.470 
not willing to pay up to 40 I know
there's<00:02:57.370> some<00:02:57.430> rumors<00:02:57.849> suggested<00:02:58.269> that<00:02:58.360> he's

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
there's some rumors suggested that he's

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.449 
there's some rumors suggested that he's
having<00:02:58.599> million<00:02:58.900> pound<00:02:59.319> it<00:02:59.709> got<00:02:59.920> rejected<00:03:00.040> but

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
having million pound it got rejected but

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:01.949 
having million pound it got rejected but
I<00:03:00.670> don't<00:03:01.120> know<00:03:01.180> how<00:03:01.269> believable<00:03:01.510> that<00:03:01.780> is

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
I don't know how believable that is

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.559 
I don't know how believable that is
though<00:03:02.110> and<00:03:02.319> even<00:03:02.890> if<00:03:03.250> we<00:03:03.670> give<00:03:04.209> up<00:03:04.330> on<00:03:04.480> our

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
though and even if we give up on our

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:08.580 
though and even if we give up on our
pursuit<00:03:04.870> of<00:03:04.980> gemstones<00:03:05.980> I<00:03:06.250> think<00:03:06.880> I<00:03:07.500> mean<00:03:08.500> the

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
pursuit of gemstones I think I mean the

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:09.809 
pursuit of gemstones I think I mean the
dreamers<00:03:08.890> would<00:03:09.040> get<00:03:09.130> rough<00:03:09.280> around<00:03:09.430> from

00:03:09.809 --> 00:03:09.819 
dreamers would get rough around from

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:11.880 
dreamers would get rough around from
Madrid<00:03:10.120> but<00:03:10.299> they<00:03:10.660> won't<00:03:10.840> tell<00:03:10.989> him<00:03:11.080> so

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
Madrid but they won't tell him so

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.039 
Madrid but they won't tell him so
something's<00:03:12.610> wrong<00:03:12.790> I<00:03:13.000> think<00:03:13.330> the<00:03:13.510> next<00:03:13.870> game

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
something's wrong I think the next game

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:16.440 
something's wrong I think the next game
against<00:03:14.470> everything<00:03:14.650> we<00:03:15.010> need<00:03:15.730> barber<00:03:16.090> Romans

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
against everything we need barber Romans

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.440 
against everything we need barber Romans
to<00:03:16.540> sort<00:03:16.780> and<00:03:17.280> I<00:03:18.280> think<00:03:18.579> that<00:03:18.790> where<00:03:19.359> the

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
to sort and I think that where the

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.569 
to sort and I think that where the
vonage<00:03:19.810> starting<00:03:20.200> billion<00:03:20.829> has<00:03:21.010> to<00:03:21.190> look

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:21.579 
vonage starting billion has to look

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:23.400 
vonage starting billion has to look
after<00:03:21.760> him<00:03:22.000> so<00:03:22.030> many<00:03:22.329> times<00:03:22.359> la<00:03:23.049> villians

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
after him so many times la villians

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.170 
after him so many times la villians
always<00:03:23.709> tracking<00:03:24.220> back<00:03:24.430> was<00:03:24.640> he<00:03:24.850> knows<00:03:25.000> they

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
always tracking back was he knows they

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.789 
always tracking back was he knows they
vanished<00:03:25.540> if<00:03:25.780> he's<00:03:26.260> supposed<00:03:26.620> to<00:03:26.680> gain

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
vanished if he's supposed to gain

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:29.250 
vanished if he's supposed to gain
spunctional--<00:03:27.250> a/c<00:03:28.239> he'll<00:03:28.810> get<00:03:28.930> done<00:03:29.109> and

spunctional-- a/c he'll get done and

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.569 
spunctional-- a/c he'll get done and
that's<00:03:29.500> that's<00:03:29.890> all<00:03:30.069> problem<00:03:30.400> like

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:30.579 
that's that's all problem like

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:33.390 
that's that's all problem like
everything<00:03:31.180> comes<00:03:31.329> from<00:03:31.510> that<00:03:31.690> side<00:03:32.160> Pedro<00:03:33.160> I

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
was a ghetto guitar gel quad I mean if

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.500 
was a ghetto guitar gel quad I mean if
in<00:03:45.310> an<00:03:45.400> hour<00:03:45.519> Pedro<00:03:45.819> will<00:03:45.970> be<00:03:46.060> screwed<00:03:46.329> and

in an hour Pedro will be screwed and

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.780 
in an hour Pedro will be screwed and
obviously<00:03:47.470> John<00:03:47.739> Terry<00:03:47.980> again<00:03:48.190> sent<00:03:48.430> off<00:03:48.579> I

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
obviously John Terry again sent off I

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:49.949 
obviously John Terry again sent off I
don't<00:03:49.000> think<00:03:49.150> he's<00:03:49.239> passed<00:03:49.450> it<00:03:49.600> was<00:03:49.750> john

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
don't think he's passed it was john

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.720 
don't think he's passed it was john
terry<00:03:50.139> has<00:03:50.290> not<00:03:50.410> put<00:03:50.560> a<00:03:50.590> foot<00:03:50.799> wrong<00:03:50.829> I<00:03:51.100> think

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
terry has not put a foot wrong I think

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:52.949 
terry has not put a foot wrong I think
it's<00:03:51.850> just<00:03:51.970> the<00:03:52.000> media's<00:03:52.389> tearing<00:03:52.690> stuff<00:03:52.810> up

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
it's just the media's tearing stuff up

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.259 
it's just the media's tearing stuff up
and<00:03:53.200> people<00:03:53.549> need<00:03:54.549> to<00:03:54.579> realize<00:03:54.940> that<00:03:54.970> John

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
and people need to realize that John

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:57.180 
and people need to realize that John
Terry's<00:03:55.569> never<00:03:55.660> relied<00:03:55.959> on<00:03:55.989> pace<00:03:56.230> it's<00:03:57.010> just

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
Terry's never relied on pace it's just

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.280 
Terry's never relied on pace it's just
his<00:03:57.609> ability<00:03:58.030> of<00:03:58.060> reading<00:03:58.239> the<00:03:58.420> game<00:03:58.569> and<00:03:59.170> I

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
his ability of reading the game and I

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.340 
his ability of reading the game and I
think<00:03:59.500> it<00:03:59.889> was<00:03:59.980> obviously<00:04:01.319> unfortunate<00:04:02.319> girl

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
think it was obviously unfortunate girl

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.129 
think it was obviously unfortunate girl
