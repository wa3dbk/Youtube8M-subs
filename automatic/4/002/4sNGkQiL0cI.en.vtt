00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:07.430
 hello today we have March 11, 2013 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:14.400
 continue work 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:16.619
 cottages we paint lining lining 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.980
 paint to paint and 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:24.050
 sanded 600 square meters here 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:30.830
 we have not polished here now 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:34.440
 sanded all polished already lining 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:38.070
 right now in this room we 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.559
 do what we stain the thorn case 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.680
 that lining and in general any idea 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:47.719
 material of extremely sensitive swings 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:52.219
 moisture it expands narrows 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:54.590
 significant enough ie opening 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:58.980
 opening in a couple of millimeters 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:02.129
 after drying is quite normal 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.000
 the phenomenon therefore flew to after 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.979
 staining on the ceiling we did not lay down the seam 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.590
 there is two millimeters millimeter he will 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.840
 visible for this first stained 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:18.270
 on the floor 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:20.880
 the car is very year very well and then we will 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.330
 paint completely already when received 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.840
 airless lining using a machine 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:33.240
 high pressure here with us everywhere 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:40.149
 there will be lining here 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:42.280
 so but here we have the first layer of oil in 

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:45.280
 principle, he performs until such more 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.170
 protective function than aesthetic like 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:51.399
 will only be finished 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:55.299
 dusty work room mostly 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:02:02.229
 Here in this large enough 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:03.909
 this hall is a stairway here we are 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:09.729
 we will put the second layer that is here 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:11.530
 here is the first layer here 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:17.860
 heaven and done 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:19.810
 decides the technical ladder so but then 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:25.569
 Here in this room is happening itself 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:32.170
 polishing lining all the same ones 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:34.750
 machine measure it has seen species 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:39.640
 she has already become unusable from 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:41.859
 abrasive dust this fix fixing 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.070
 the element for the hose is exactly cross 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:47.290
 I have to wrap up with scotch 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.390
 her mileage is more than a kilometer 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:54.040
 that is exactly the phone 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:55.959
 she still has 2 2 machine shifts and came back 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.329
 one machine completely polished whole 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:04.030
 this house is well thought up 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:09.370
 polished at least a kilometer nobody 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:10.250
 did not consider so now let's go to the second 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:35.200
 floor 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:35.200
 like this 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:45.549
 so here we have on applying the second 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:48.670
 the layer was made literally today here 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:54.159
 you can see the difference here 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:57.709
 one layer is applied here for 2 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:04:00.319
 but he still has glitters 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:03.169
 not very shiny when in layer 2 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:06.430
 applied after the third layer begins 

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:18.500
 already such a brilliant shine 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:21.759
 the room is made for a long time about 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.759
 here it all looks 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.169
 here are our filled bitches 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:44.240
 I must say that the composition of which we 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:48.360
 fill the knots 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:50.759
 it is certainly different in its properties 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:55.199
 from diego he has a little bit higher 

00:04:50.759 --> 00:05:00.539
 absorbability therefore before applying 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:05:01.259
 the second layer of butter we little you 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:04.259
 fettered 

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:06.509
 here are our wax seal 

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:10.580
 crayons after sealing wax 

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:15.479
 pencils absorbency in 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:20.149
 this of your touched him another year 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:25.199
 formulations on level off with the rest 

00:05:20.149 --> 00:05:29.719
 wood all all thanks for your attention 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:29.719
 to new meetings
