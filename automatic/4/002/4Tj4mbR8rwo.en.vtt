00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.750
 ah 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.410
 hello very good everyone i'm s26 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.450
 welcome end tutorial 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.010
 desktop personalization 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.920
 more specifically we will customize 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.720
 what is this little button of windows is worth 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.090
 the start button also known as 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.590
 org today we are going to use a software the 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.940
 which I will leave in the description of the video 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.890
 OK 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.440
 the program will be for a file 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.149
 mediafire and good is this the file and 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.940
 nothing simply the right button master 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:00.300
 to extract here is to extract and in ballet a 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.539
 once extracted we have this folder in the 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.280
 that we have a part now but leaving 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.580
 good for what good because we 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.540
 change more to your liking and the 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.370
 Program 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:16.390
 we double click on it and it would run 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:19.960
 let's go in here 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:23.350
 there we have it good to change it 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:26.530
 as you can see it is very simple we will 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.180
 to recognize that this program has 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.090
 done in this great programmer maybe 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.310
 wander already and well this would be the page in 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.750
 the one that raised things because I already tell you 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.180
 this page right now is no longer 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.390
 available the free program hung it 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.830
 free and good for all the 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.510
 merits are yours according to me 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.820
 simply 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:47.200
 I give a little publicity and I encourage you to 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.360
 do not use this software because 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.670
 it really works pretty well and 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.250
 we can customize a little more 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.020
 our desk to our liking and 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.610
 good as you can see it is 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.180
 pretty simple we do not give here to 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.920
 chance and we change what hair is 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.990
 let's take the worst bread we have 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.720
 let's select one that suits a 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.720
 little bit about the subject I certainly wanted 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.850
 also comment that this topic because 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.770
 you see on the screen if you like it and so on 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.860
 to leave in the comments and good 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:20.480
 I'll do a tutorial so you know 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.989
 how to put the desk accordingly 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.860
 let's choose one if in this same 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:29.269
 it's ok if we bluntly open it 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.099
 we wait a few moments and the 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:33.650
 agreement as you see flame changes value 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:35.569
 now you have to give me this message 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.910
 like everything is correct and everything is 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:40.670
 in order we give in accepting and good you 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.550
 I would have changed what ballet is 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.920
 As you can see, it works quite well and nothing 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.569
 we customize what is the button 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.520
 start windows one more way 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:51.620
 attractive I think for the people who 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.420
 be tired of seeing that little button there 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.580
 well 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:59.440
 and change it this way the so fast 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.440
 well, it's pretty good 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.600
 however I will say some 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.610
 problems that this software gives 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.410
 now we give you here to restore and as 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.810
 you see me this error that you can jump 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.780
 being on screen and it's complicated 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.490
 is how to get it right if you do not know 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.840
 how is it worth there are many people who are stressed 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.490
 and others because they call you 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.500
 the taskbar disappeared the button 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:23.819
 Start and more is simple worth you 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:26.680
 we give control by suppressing according 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:28.060
 we start the task manager and 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.040
 good as we can see here we have 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.640
 all processes and so on then what 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.980
 let's go here to file new task and 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.420
 let's put here is explorer is worth it 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.400
 run would we do the explorer of 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.400
 new that would be the desk 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.349
 we accept and would appear 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.980
 again wrong this is a small mistake that 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:49.450
 has this software however, because 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.340
 everything else works pretty well already 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.709
 diego that to change the oven is the 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.560
 simple and good to reset the other 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:58.690
 some will fail others and in my 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.069
 case he does fail me and others 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.930
 I say you will not give him this 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:05.680
 will change to the start logo 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.989
 automatically having a problem and 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.670
 another is to have to do this it's worth it 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:11.290
 that nothing will change for the last time 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.170
 we take another one so you can see that 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:18.480
 everything works right let's change to 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:20.760
 see come this same has been windows 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.500
 there we have it as you see, because we have the 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.390
 little button of windows and everything 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.590
 perfectly we wait for him to give us the 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:28.950
 message that everything is correct 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.390
 accept and I would hope everything goes 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:32.889
 just that you liked this 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:35.379
 small tutorial and I tell you that 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:37.180
