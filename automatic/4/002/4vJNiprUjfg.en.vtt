00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:24.519
 that we did not understand 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:25.819
 you say defensive 

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:27.730
 like that does not pass for a non-place 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.730
 it's my secret boot 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.140
 hello but good 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.380
 I created for the actress 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.390
 I was impatient to see 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.500
 you have many questions and although the passage is interest not 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.650
 aware that they remain hardly anyway and devilishly tumor 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.510
 some of my answers are therefore accessible but not all 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.680
 corollary though your first question may seem the most 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.860
 relevant it might well be that you ignore that the target rate plus body of 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.300
 About 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.850
 this statement 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:09.960
 the night 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.960
 the rest of an equation unbalanced rents the programming of the matrix 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.540
 you are the possibility of an anomaly that despite my best efforts 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.100
 sincerely we were unable to eliminate from what is otherwise 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.330
 a mathematical precision harmony 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.400
 sees that she remains a burden you do not want to cross she has nothing to 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.400
 surprising and can therefore obey control measures 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:34.760
 they led you 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.760
 inexorably 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.210
 you were faster than everyone else 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.270
 I prefer to count in stages of the emergence of an anomaly at 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.310
 the emergence and wind with you we are in the sixth version 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.090
 as you have probably already deduced the anomaly is systemic why 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.360
 understood later that the success of the breakaway because it was necessary 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.670
 mind lower than mine you maybe well 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.890
 but above all it would be good to point out that these parameters of perfection 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.010
 former 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.560
 that's how the answer was found by accident 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.560
 by running another program 

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:29.439
 still heavy this week 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:31.860
 it's unstoppable 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.019
 really complicated 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.329
 everyone 2010 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:39.329
 it's noticeable after his insults 

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:42.849
 because if people have fled 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:45.849
 after we will really go for groups 

00:02:56.429 --> 00:02:59.429
 unless one notice the one of 2008 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:04.609
 the announced was made 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:06.359
 philibert 

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:09.359
 is there nothing 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:14.189
