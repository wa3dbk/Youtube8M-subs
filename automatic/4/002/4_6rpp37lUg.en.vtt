for so long and you saw a different

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:48.150 
for so long and you saw a different
trail<00:06:46.750> son<00:06:47.020> and<00:06:47.169> when<00:06:47.259> the<00:06:47.350> spotlight<00:06:47.860> was<00:06:48.009> on

and when there was time to make money he

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:51.779 
and when there was time to make money he
knew<00:06:50.199> by<00:06:50.350> taking<00:06:50.740> all<00:06:50.889> of<00:06:50.919> those<00:06:51.160> fights<00:06:51.580> in

00:06:51.779 --> 00:06:51.789 
knew by taking all of those fights in

00:06:51.789 --> 00:06:54.540 
knew by taking all of those fights in
such<00:06:52.000> a<00:06:52.030> short<00:06:52.389> period<00:06:52.990> of<00:06:53.740> time<00:06:53.800> that<00:06:54.009> you

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:54.550 
such a short period of time that you

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:56.490 
such a short period of time that you
know<00:06:54.669> this<00:06:54.850> sport<00:06:55.090> is<00:06:55.270> changing<00:06:55.720> so<00:06:55.900> fast<00:06:55.930> I

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:56.500 
know this sport is changing so fast I

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.920 
know this sport is changing so fast I
might<00:06:56.889> be<00:06:57.039> forced<00:06:57.280> to<00:06:57.490> you<00:06:58.300> know<00:06:58.419> get<00:06:58.660> out<00:06:58.780> of

00:06:58.920 --> 00:06:58.930 
might be forced to you know get out of

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:00.540
