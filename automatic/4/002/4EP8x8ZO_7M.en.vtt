it's a prequel they're in college and he

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.130 
it's a prequel they're in college and he

walked away that's all he said but then

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.780 
walked away that's all he said but then
my<00:00:56.260> mind<00:00:56.440> started<00:00:56.560> racing<00:00:56.830> going<00:00:57.340> what<00:00:57.760> a

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
my mind started racing going what a

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:58.970 
my mind started racing going what a
great<00:00:58.360> idea

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
great idea

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.350 
great idea

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.360 
because if you just said another it's a

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.780 
because if you just said another it's a
sequel<00:01:01.750> of<00:01:01.900> risky<00:01:02.200> anyway<00:01:02.650> mm-hmm<00:01:03.220> but<00:01:03.490> if<00:01:03.640> you

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.820 
sequel of risky anyway mm-hmm but if you
tell<00:01:04.059> the<00:01:04.180> story<00:01:04.360> they<00:01:04.600> had<00:01:04.839> no<00:01:05.290> idea<00:01:05.710> about

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.120 
absolutely absolutely and I'm I was very

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.520 
absolutely absolutely and I'm I was very
pleasantly<00:01:34.510> surprised<00:01:34.990> because<00:01:35.290> I<00:01:35.470> think

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
pleasantly surprised because I think

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.740 
pleasantly surprised because I think
there's<00:01:36.430> a<00:01:36.490> lot<00:01:36.640> of<00:01:36.670> prequels<00:01:37.060> these<00:01:37.210> days<00:01:37.450> and

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
there's a lot of prequels these days and

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.539 
there's a lot of prequels these days and
sometimes<00:01:38.080> they<00:01:38.350> sort<00:01:38.560> of<00:01:38.620> shoehorn<00:01:38.979> in<00:01:39.370> these

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:39.549 
sometimes they sort of shoehorn in these

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:41.880 
sometimes they sort of shoehorn in these
moments<00:01:39.820> and<00:01:40.210> oh<00:01:40.450> that's<00:01:41.140> how<00:01:41.320> that<00:01:41.500> happened

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
moments and oh that's how that happened

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.320 
moments and oh that's how that happened
and<00:01:41.979> that's<00:01:42.040> how<00:01:42.220> we<00:01:42.310> get<00:01:42.400> and<00:01:42.549> I<00:01:42.580> thought<00:01:42.760> this

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 
and that's how we get and I thought this

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.000 
and that's how we get and I thought this
was<00:01:43.510> particularly<00:01:44.470> great<00:01:44.619> because<00:01:44.830> it<00:01:44.920> works

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.010 
was particularly great because it works

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.800 
was particularly great because it works
as<00:01:45.220> a<00:01:45.250> standalone<00:01:45.610> film<00:01:45.970> I<00:01:46.180> thought<00:01:46.570> so<00:01:46.750> too

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
as a standalone film I thought so too

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.630 
as a standalone film I thought so too
and<00:01:47.200> then<00:01:47.380> because<00:01:47.680> you<00:01:48.340> know<00:01:48.430> it's<00:01:48.580> a

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
and then because you know it's a

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.850 
and then because you know it's a
universal<00:01:49.270> story<00:01:50.880> about<00:01:51.880> coming-of-age
