00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
cook but it really isn't I just make

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.249 
cook but it really isn't I just make
mine<00:01:14.549> in<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:15.000> rice<00:01:15.150> cooker<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:15.810> can<00:01:16.170> of

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
but I actually prefer to do a 2 to 1

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.469 
but I actually prefer to do a 2 to 1
ratio<00:01:19.770> water<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.549> rice<00:01:20.700> because<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.090> makes<00:01:21.330> it

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
ratio water to rice because it makes it

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.320 
ratio water to rice because it makes it
a<00:01:21.600> little<00:01:21.840> bit<00:01:22.020> less<00:01:22.560> crunchy<00:01:23.250> now<00:01:23.790> I'm<00:01:24.030> going

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
now as you can see I'm just putting it

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.520 
now as you can see I'm just putting it
over<00:02:33.910> a<00:02:34.120> medium-high<00:02:34.450> heat<00:02:34.600> and<00:02:34.990> I'm<00:02:35.110> whisking

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
over a medium-high heat and I'm whisking

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.010 
over a medium-high heat and I'm whisking
it<00:02:35.650> until<00:02:35.680> it<00:02:36.010> starts<00:02:36.370> to<00:02:36.790> steam<00:02:37.300> and<00:02:37.600> then<00:02:37.930> I'm

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
it until it starts to steam and then I'm

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.320 
it until it starts to steam and then I'm
going<00:02:38.200> to<00:02:38.290> slowly<00:02:38.590> whisk<00:02:39.160> in<00:02:39.430> my<00:02:39.850> thickening

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
going to slowly whisk in my thickening

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.630 
going to slowly whisk in my thickening
agent<00:02:40.750> I<00:02:40.900> also<00:02:41.709> completely<00:02:42.190> forgot<00:02:42.520> to

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
agent I also completely forgot to

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.770 
agent I also completely forgot to
mention<00:02:42.760> that<00:02:43.030> you<00:02:43.120> could<00:02:43.270> totally<00:02:43.660> add

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
mention that you could totally add

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.330 
mention that you could totally add
stevia<00:02:44.200> to<00:02:44.290> this<00:02:44.470> to<00:02:44.650> make<00:02:44.770> it<00:02:44.800> sweeter<00:02:45.130> as

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
stevia to this to make it sweeter as

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.750 
stevia to this to make it sweeter as
well

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
well

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.910 
well
when<00:02:46.360> using<00:02:46.690> cornstarch<00:02:46.959> you<00:02:47.350> know<00:02:47.530> that<00:02:47.800> it

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
when using cornstarch you know that it

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.890 
when using cornstarch you know that it
is<00:02:47.950> done<00:02:48.280> thickening<00:02:48.730> when<00:02:49.000> it<00:02:49.120> gets<00:02:49.240> a<00:02:49.360> glossy

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
is done thickening when it gets a glossy

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.660 
is done thickening when it gets a glossy
finish<00:02:50.260> so<00:02:50.470> I'm<00:02:50.950> just<00:02:51.100> going<00:02:51.250> to<00:02:51.370> pour<00:02:51.640> that

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
finish so I'm just going to pour that

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.250 
finish so I'm just going to pour that
into<00:02:51.970> a<00:02:52.120> bowl<00:02:52.450> and<00:02:52.690> let<00:02:52.840> it<00:02:52.930> sit<00:02:53.080> on<00:02:53.110> the

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
into a bowl and let it sit on the

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.870 
into a bowl and let it sit on the
counter<00:02:53.350> and<00:02:53.740> then<00:02:53.950> refrigerate<00:02:54.459> it<00:02:54.490> and<00:02:54.610> it

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
counter and then refrigerate it and it

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.420 
counter and then refrigerate it and it
will<00:02:54.970> get<00:02:55.090> thicker<00:02:55.300> as<00:02:55.600> it<00:02:55.990> sits<00:02:56.320> and<00:02:56.560> sets<00:02:57.220> in

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
will get thicker as it sits and sets in

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:03.230 
will get thicker as it sits and sets in
the<00:02:57.580> fridge

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:03.240 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.910 

all<00:03:04.240> righty<00:03:04.450> so<00:03:04.660> these<00:03:04.810> next<00:03:05.170> steps<00:03:05.230> are<00:03:05.500> super

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
all righty so these next steps are super

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.440 
all righty so these next steps are super
simple<00:03:06.220> and<00:03:06.400> that<00:03:06.490> would<00:03:06.610> just<00:03:06.760> be<00:03:06.880> to<00:03:07.060> pre-cut

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
simple and that would just be to pre-cut

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.030 
simple and that would just be to pre-cut
and<00:03:07.660> wash<00:03:07.840> any<00:03:08.110> vegetables<00:03:08.620> that<00:03:08.770> you<00:03:08.860> think

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
and wash any vegetables that you think

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.140 
and wash any vegetables that you think
you'll<00:03:09.160> be<00:03:09.190> eating<00:03:09.550> throughout<00:03:09.700> the<00:03:09.760> week

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
you'll be eating throughout the week

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.360 
you'll be eating throughout the week
I<00:03:10.180> love<00:03:10.450> butternut<00:03:10.810> squash<00:03:11.080> and<00:03:11.320> green<00:03:12.130> beans

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
I love butternut squash and green beans

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.010 
I love butternut squash and green beans
so<00:03:12.550> I<00:03:12.730> went<00:03:12.970> ahead<00:03:13.030> and<00:03:13.150> washed<00:03:13.450> those<00:03:13.750> and

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
so I went ahead and washed those and

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.020 
so I went ahead and washed those and
also<00:03:14.440> this<00:03:14.890> really<00:03:15.070> isn't<00:03:15.340> much<00:03:15.520> of<00:03:15.670> cooking

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
also this really isn't much of cooking

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:17.280 
also this really isn't much of cooking
but<00:03:16.150> just<00:03:16.330> make<00:03:16.450> sure<00:03:16.480> that<00:03:16.750> you<00:03:16.810> have<00:03:16.990> dips

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
but just make sure that you have dips

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.050 
but just make sure that you have dips
