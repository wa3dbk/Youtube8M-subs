00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
in a while it's high-def HD 1920 by 1080

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.620 
in a while it's high-def HD 1920 by 1080
which<00:00:34.380> is<00:00:34.559> full<00:00:34.800> HD<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.520> it's<00:00:35.910> also<00:00:36.059> tapeless

if you're out on a shoot you a lot of

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.620 
if you're out on a shoot you a lot of
times<00:01:40.079> you<00:01:40.200> used<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:40.979> using<00:01:41.250> tape<00:01:41.640> well<00:01:42.299> think

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
times you used to using tape well think

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.240 
times you used to using tape well think
of<00:01:42.689> SD<00:01:43.020> cards<00:01:43.320> as<00:01:43.409> multiple<00:01:43.770> tapes<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.130> can

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
of SD cards as multiple tapes you can

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.819 
of SD cards as multiple tapes you can
just<00:01:44.430> pop<00:01:44.640> in<00:01:44.850> multiple<00:01:45.240> SD<00:01:45.540> cards<00:01:45.869> but<00:01:46.380> even

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
just pop in multiple SD cards but even

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.710 
just pop in multiple SD cards but even
nowadays<00:01:47.130> with<00:01:47.310> 32<00:01:47.670> gig<00:01:47.880> SD<00:01:48.270> cards<00:01:48.570> you

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
nowadays with 32 gig SD cards you

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.120 
nowadays with 32 gig SD cards you
probably<00:01:49.110> won't<00:01:49.259> run<00:01:49.439> out<00:01:49.590> of<00:01:49.619> space<00:01:49.890> that

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
probably won't run out of space that

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.160 
probably won't run out of space that
that<00:01:50.399> quickly<00:01:50.670> so<00:01:51.299> I<00:01:51.329> understand<00:01:51.960> that<00:01:52.079> this

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
that quickly so I understand that this

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.560 
that quickly so I understand that this
also<00:01:52.409> does<00:01:52.860> still<00:01:53.310> photography<00:01:53.880> but<00:01:54.119> I'm<00:01:54.270> a

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
also does still photography but I'm a

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.480 
also does still photography but I'm a
little<00:01:54.869> weary<00:01:55.079> of<00:01:55.170> this<00:01:55.380> just<00:01:55.649> because<00:01:55.979> you

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
little weary of this just because you

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.399 
little weary of this just because you
know<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.640> lot<00:01:56.790> of<00:01:56.820> camcorders<00:01:57.450> they<00:01:57.659> offer<00:01:57.930> this

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
know a lot of camcorders they offer this

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.440 
know a lot of camcorders they offer this
still<00:01:58.649> photography<00:01:59.100> not<00:01:59.490> good<00:01:59.670> quality<00:01:59.790> no<00:02:00.420> a

lot of times they advertise it but what

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.310 
lot of times they advertise it but what
it<00:02:02.219> actually<00:02:02.579> equals<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:03.420> as<00:02:03.630> far<00:02:03.869> as<00:02:03.930> quality

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
it actually equals to as far as quality

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.469
