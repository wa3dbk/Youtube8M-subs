00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
everything on it they get just

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.120

don't know where to start

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.639 
don't know where to start
I'm<00:00:37.559> trying<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:38.070> get<00:00:38.250> them<00:00:38.489> into<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:39.649> mindset

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
I'm trying to get them into a mindset

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.030 
I'm trying to get them into a mindset
where<00:00:41.579> you<00:00:41.790> pick<00:00:42.390> out<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.690> shapes<00:00:43.469> that<00:00:43.770> you

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
where you pick out the shapes that you

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.910 
where you pick out the shapes that you
see<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:45.680> draw<00:00:46.680> just<00:00:47.520> those<00:00:47.789> shapes<00:00:48.420> and

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
see and draw just those shapes and

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.840 
see and draw just those shapes and
eventually<00:00:49.920> you'll<00:00:50.129> have<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.640> whole<00:00:50.820> thing

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
eventually you'll have the whole thing

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.869 
eventually you'll have the whole thing
the<00:00:51.809> whole<00:00:51.840> picture<00:00:52.170> drawn<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:53.430> you<00:00:53.550> put

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
the whole picture drawn and you put

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.760 
the whole picture drawn and you put
color<00:00:54.120> on<00:00:54.360> it<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.629> you're<00:00:54.750> done<00:00:54.930> but<00:00:55.260> that's

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
color on it and you're done but that's

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.350 
color on it and you're done but that's
kind<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.100> that's<00:00:56.309> hard<00:00:56.579> to<00:00:56.730> do<00:00:56.850> that's<00:00:57.090> hard<00:00:57.270> to

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
kind of that's hard to do that's hard to

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.979 
kind of that's hard to do that's hard to
do<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.719> I<00:00:58.789> tell<00:00:59.789> you<00:00:59.940> I<00:01:00.000> have<00:01:00.329> something<00:01:00.629> here

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
to help me try to get them in a

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.240 
to help me try to get them in a
different<00:01:05.489> mind<00:01:05.729> frame<00:01:05.909> just<00:01:06.840> look<00:01:07.619> at<00:01:07.890> the

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
different mind frame just look at the

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.870 
different mind frame just look at the
picture

one here that has a kitty cat and you
can<00:01:31.740> see<00:01:31.890> how<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.130> can<00:01:32.369> just<00:01:32.610> draw<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.060> basic

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
can see how you can just draw the basic

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.780 
can see how you can just draw the basic
shapes<00:01:33.900> you<00:01:34.470> have<00:01:34.650> your<00:01:34.799> circle<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.520> then<00:01:35.670> you

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
shapes you have your circle and then you

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.240 
shapes you have your circle and then you
put<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.000> bigger<00:01:36.270> circle<00:01:36.720> under<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.350> put<00:01:37.979> a

put a bigger circle under it you put a

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.330 
put a bigger circle under it you put a
couple<00:01:38.670> of<00:01:38.790> triangles<00:01:39.030> on<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:40.049> ears<00:01:40.320> flip<00:01:41.220> it

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
couple of triangles on the ears flip it

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.060 
couple of triangles on the ears flip it
over<00:01:41.430> on<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.759> back<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.570> have<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:42.780> wavy<00:01:43.560> line

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
over on the back you have a wavy line

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.530 
over on the back you have a wavy line
for<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.640> tail<00:01:44.880> that<00:01:45.119> you<00:01:45.299> double<00:01:45.780> and

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
for the tail that you double and

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
goodness is the number two and mr. P has

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.330 
goodness is the number two and mr. P has
turned<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.440> two<00:02:10.679> until<00:02:11.160> snake

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
turned the two until snake

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.780 
turned the two until snake
and<00:02:12.599> that's<00:02:13.599> something<00:02:13.989> is<00:02:14.110> really<00:02:14.290> cool<00:02:14.790> one

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
and that's something is really cool one

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.160 
and that's something is really cool one
of<00:02:15.849> my<00:02:15.910> favorites<00:02:16.300> to<00:02:16.420> draw<00:02:16.599> actually<00:02:16.810> I<00:02:17.019> guess

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
of my favorites to draw actually I guess

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.540 
of my favorites to draw actually I guess
I<00:02:17.260> can<00:02:17.410> go<00:02:17.530> ahead<00:02:17.590> and<00:02:17.709> draw<00:02:17.890> it<00:02:17.950> for<00:02:18.190> you

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.830 

you<00:02:21.550> start<00:02:21.849> out<00:02:21.940> just<00:02:22.180> really<00:02:22.360> regular<00:02:22.660> sheet

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
you start out just really regular sheet

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.119 
you start out just really regular sheet
of<00:02:22.930> paper<00:02:23.050> I<00:02:23.349> don't<00:02:23.620> know<00:02:23.680> if<00:02:23.769> you<00:02:24.010> can

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:24.129 
of paper I don't know if you can

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:28.050 
of paper I don't know if you can
hopefully<00:02:25.090> you<00:02:25.300> can<00:02:25.450> see<00:02:25.900> that<00:02:26.110> I<00:02:26.910> know<00:02:27.910> it's

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
hopefully you can see that I know it's

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.369 
hopefully you can see that I know it's
going<00:02:28.150> to<00:02:28.209> be<00:02:28.360> probably<00:02:28.540> at<00:02:28.810> a<00:02:28.840> weird<00:02:29.110> angle

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:29.379 
going to be probably at a weird angle

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:31.729 
going to be probably at a weird angle
here<00:02:29.980> but<00:02:30.190> we'll<00:02:30.489> see<00:02:30.700> how<00:02:30.730> it<00:02:31.000> goes

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
here but we'll see how it goes

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:35.970 
here but we'll see how it goes
start<00:02:32.739> out<00:02:32.920> with<00:02:33.129> the<00:02:33.670> number<00:02:33.700> two<00:02:34.239> and<00:02:34.980> also

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
start out with the number two and also

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.740 
start out with the number two and also
you<00:02:36.129> want<00:02:36.250> to<00:02:36.340> get<00:02:36.489> them<00:02:36.580> to<00:02:36.670> draw<00:02:36.879> it<00:02:36.940> beep<00:02:37.330> -

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
you want to get them to draw it beep -

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.780 
you want to get them to draw it beep -
you<00:02:38.110> know<00:02:38.230> they<00:02:38.349> want<00:02:38.530> it<00:02:38.650> they<00:02:38.830> they<00:02:39.310> draw

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
you know they want it they they draw

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.050 
you know they want it they they draw
oftentimes<00:02:40.720> draw<00:02:40.989> so<00:02:41.410> small<00:02:41.860> and<00:02:42.250> it's<00:02:42.700> hard

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
oftentimes draw so small and it's hard

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.140 
oftentimes draw so small and it's hard
to<00:02:43.299> get<00:02:43.510> them<00:02:43.690> out<00:02:43.870> of<00:02:43.930> that<00:02:44.260> frame<00:02:44.709> whether

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
to get them out of that frame whether

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.199 
to get them out of that frame whether
drawing<00:02:46.150> really<00:02:46.480> small<00:02:47.549> okay<00:02:48.549> so<00:02:48.880> the<00:02:49.000> next

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
drawing really small okay so the next

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.430 
drawing really small okay so the next
step<00:02:49.420> was<00:02:49.599> you<00:02:49.810> put<00:02:50.849> three<00:02:51.849> lines<00:02:52.319> under<00:02:53.319> the

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
step was you put three lines under the

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.580 
step was you put three lines under the
number<00:02:53.769> two<00:02:54.510> after<00:02:55.510> that<00:02:55.720> you<00:02:55.870> can<00:02:55.989> go<00:02:56.140> back<00:02:56.319> in

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
number two after that you can go back in

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.860 
number two after that you can go back in
close<00:02:57.549> in<00:02:57.910> I<00:02:58.390> like<00:02:58.629> to<00:02:58.780> close<00:02:59.079> in<00:02:59.379> this<00:02:59.650> section

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
close in I like to close in this section

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.089 
close in I like to close in this section
just<00:03:01.870> with<00:03:02.170> three<00:03:02.470> curved<00:03:02.769> lines<00:03:04.140> not<00:03:05.140> pick<00:03:06.069> it

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
just with three curved lines not pick it

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:07.890 
just with three curved lines not pick it
up<00:03:06.310> after<00:03:06.489> each<00:03:06.790> step<00:03:07.120> so<00:03:07.329> you<00:03:07.360> can<00:03:07.569> see<00:03:07.750> what

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
up after each step so you can see what

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.080 
up after each step so you can see what
I've<00:03:08.019> done<00:03:08.049> to<00:03:08.410> cold<00:03:09.160> close<00:03:09.489> up<00:03:09.670> that<00:03:09.700> section

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
I've done to cold close up that section

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.660 
I've done to cold close up that section
and<00:03:10.360> now<00:03:10.840> here's<00:03:11.349> the<00:03:11.500> part<00:03:11.769> where<00:03:11.829> you<00:03:12.190> could

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
and now here's the part where you could

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.460 
and now here's the part where you could
get<00:03:12.970> a<00:03:13.030> little<00:03:13.239> messed<00:03:13.540> up<00:03:13.720> we're<00:03:14.260> going<00:03:14.379> to

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
get a little messed up we're going to

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.440 
get a little messed up we're going to
start<00:03:14.769> here<00:03:15.310> and<00:03:15.459> we're<00:03:16.030> going<00:03:16.150> to<00:03:16.239> make

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
start here and we're going to make

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.009 
start here and we're going to make
another<00:03:16.829> kind<00:03:17.829> of<00:03:17.980> wave<00:03:18.340> in<00:03:18.670> line<00:03:18.880> and<00:03:19.299> we're

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
another kind of wave in line and we're

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:22.129 
another kind of wave in line and we're
going<00:03:20.170> to<00:03:20.200> end<00:03:20.470> that<00:03:20.920> wave<00:03:21.220> your<00:03:21.459> line<00:03:21.639> on<00:03:21.970> that

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:22.139 
going to end that wave your line on that

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:25.379 
going to end that wave your line on that
first<00:03:23.139> straight<00:03:23.799> line<00:03:24.069> that<00:03:24.310> you<00:03:24.489> drew<00:03:24.700> a<00:03:24.880> lot

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:25.389 
first straight line that you drew a lot

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:28.110 
first straight line that you drew a lot
of<00:03:25.540> kids<00:03:25.840> will<00:03:26.410> start<00:03:27.069> the<00:03:27.250> wavy<00:03:27.489> line<00:03:27.849> and

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
of kids will start the wavy line and

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.960 
of kids will start the wavy line and
they'll<00:03:28.239> end<00:03:28.569> it<00:03:28.840> right<00:03:28.989> at<00:03:29.260> the<00:03:29.290> point<00:03:29.829> of<00:03:30.160> the

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
they'll end it right at the point of the

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.640 
they'll end it right at the point of the
number<00:03:31.269> two<00:03:31.450> but<00:03:31.989> that's<00:03:32.079> not<00:03:32.319> where<00:03:32.500> you<00:03:32.620> want

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
number two but that's not where you want

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.110 
number two but that's not where you want
to<00:03:32.889> end<00:03:33.040> it<00:03:33.160> you<00:03:33.280> want<00:03:33.430> to<00:03:33.489> end<00:03:33.609> it<00:03:33.670> down<00:03:33.849> here

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
to end it you want to end it down here

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.210 
to end it you want to end it down here
so<00:03:34.329> I'm<00:03:34.750> going<00:03:34.959> to<00:03:35.019> go<00:03:35.170> ahead<00:03:35.440> and<00:03:35.829> draw<00:03:36.040> that

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
so I'm going to go ahead and draw that

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.960 
so I'm going to go ahead and draw that

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
that first first straight line that you

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.960 
that first first straight line that you
drew<00:03:49.209> okay<00:03:49.959> after<00:03:50.380> that<00:03:50.739> you're<00:03:51.730> going<00:03:51.880> to

drew okay after that you're going to

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.449 
drew okay after that you're going to
make<00:03:52.090> another<00:03:52.329> curved<00:03:52.630> line<00:03:52.660> and<00:03:53.459> another

make another curved line and another
curved<00:03:54.760> line<00:03:55.150> to<00:03:56.280> close<00:03:57.599> it<00:03:58.599> up<00:03:58.780> and<00:03:59.019> you're

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
curved line to close it up and you're

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.650 
curved line to close it up and you're
pretty<00:03:59.859> much<00:04:00.010> almost<00:04:00.669> got<00:04:00.970> your<00:04:01.150> snake<00:04:01.389> done

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
you can put leave some some space

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.970 
you can put leave some some space
in<00:04:21.510> there<00:04:21.840> see<00:04:22.080> how<00:04:22.230> I<00:04:22.260> left<00:04:22.530> some<00:04:22.710> space<00:04:22.950> you

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:22.980 
in there see how I left some space you

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.130 
in there see how I left some space you
can<00:04:23.280> see<00:04:23.430> that<00:04:23.610> see<00:04:24.060> how<00:04:24.210> I<00:04:24.240> left<00:04:24.480> the<00:04:24.600> space<00:04:24.900> in

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
can see that see how I left the space in

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.620 
can see that see how I left the space in
the<00:04:25.410> old<00:04:25.620> me<00:04:26.280> in<00:04:26.430> the<00:04:26.550> circle<00:04:26.760> and<00:04:27.000> the<00:04:27.150> dot<00:04:27.330> I

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
the old me in the circle and the dot I

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.660 
the old me in the circle and the dot I
guess<00:04:28.260> I<00:04:28.380> get<00:04:28.500> it<00:04:28.590> right<00:04:28.680> left<00:04:29.070> the<00:04:29.160> space<00:04:29.430> in

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:29.670 
guess I get it right left the space in

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:32.030 
guess I get it right left the space in
the<00:04:29.940> dot<00:04:30.200> so<00:04:31.200> it<00:04:31.350> kind<00:04:31.560> of<00:04:31.590> looks<00:04:31.770> a<00:04:31.800> little<00:04:31.860> bit

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 
the dot so it kind of looks a little bit

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.760 
the dot so it kind of looks a little bit
more<00:04:32.190> realistic<00:04:32.490> and<00:04:32.880> you<00:04:33.180> can<00:04:33.300> put<00:04:33.480> some

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
more realistic and you can put some

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.420 
more realistic and you can put some
eyebrows<00:04:34.770> on<00:04:35.160> them<00:04:35.370> if<00:04:35.490> you<00:04:35.640> want<00:04:35.850> to<00:04:36.120> you<00:04:36.810> know

eyebrows on them if you want to you know

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.720 
eyebrows on them if you want to you know

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
body you can put stripes make them a

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.570 
body you can put stripes make them a
stripe<00:04:51.300> snake<00:04:51.660> little<00:04:52.290> triangles<00:04:53.160> make<00:04:53.460> them

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
stripe snake little triangles make them

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.150 
stripe snake little triangles make them

a diamondback rattlesnake if you want to
I<00:04:56.220> think<00:04:57.090> the<00:04:57.210> handout<00:04:57.660> just<00:04:57.990> put<00:04:58.230> these

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
I think the handout just put these

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.870 
I think the handout just put these
little<00:04:59.840> half<00:05:00.840> circles<00:05:01.590> and<00:05:02.250> you<00:05:02.520> can<00:05:02.670> just

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
little half circles and you can just

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.370 
little half circles and you can just
tell<00:05:03.030> your<00:05:03.150> kids<00:05:03.360> how<00:05:03.450> you<00:05:03.570> make<00:05:03.750> curved<00:05:03.990> lines

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 
tell your kids how you make curved lines

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.420 
tell your kids how you make curved lines
if<00:05:04.710> you<00:05:04.800> want<00:05:04.980> to<00:05:05.130> look<00:05:05.310> like<00:05:05.490> he<00:05:06.390> has<00:05:06.690> a<00:05:07.430> some

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
if you want to look like he has a some

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.550 
if you want to look like he has a some
kind<00:05:08.700> of<00:05:08.760> dots<00:05:09.390> or<00:05:09.690> something<00:05:10.080> on<00:05:10.260> them<00:05:10.440> you

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
kind of dots or something on them you

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.000 
kind of dots or something on them you
know<00:05:11.870> and<00:05:12.870> that's<00:05:13.020> pretty<00:05:13.230> much<00:05:13.350> all<00:05:13.650> you<00:05:13.860> have

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
know and that's pretty much all you have

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:16.820 
know and that's pretty much all you have
to<00:05:14.130> do<00:05:14.280> to<00:05:14.400> make<00:05:14.580> the<00:05:14.700> snake<00:05:14.940> now<00:05:15.440> it<00:05:16.440> will<00:05:16.770> take

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
to do to make the snake now it will take

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.350 
to do to make the snake now it will take
a<00:05:17.160> little<00:05:17.430> while<00:05:17.580> to<00:05:18.300> get<00:05:18.540> the<00:05:18.720> kid<00:05:18.960> out<00:05:19.260> of<00:05:19.320> the

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
a little while to get the kid out of the

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.360 
a little while to get the kid out of the
out<00:05:21.360> of<00:05:21.420> the<00:05:21.540> mindset<00:05:22.260> that<00:05:22.290> I<00:05:22.500> can't<00:05:22.950> do<00:05:23.190> this

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
out of the mindset that I can't do this

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.550 
out of the mindset that I can't do this
I<00:05:23.610> can't<00:05:23.940> do<00:05:24.150> this<00:05:24.330> and<00:05:24.600> this<00:05:24.930> is<00:05:25.110> a<00:05:25.140> good<00:05:25.410> one

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
I can't do this and this is a good one

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.500 
I can't do this and this is a good one
that's<00:05:25.740> this<00:05:25.950> is<00:05:26.160> up<00:05:26.370> I'm<00:05:26.820> pretty<00:05:27.090> good<00:05:27.270> one<00:05:27.420> to

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:27.510 
that's this is up I'm pretty good one to

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:29.270 
that's this is up I'm pretty good one to
start<00:05:27.540> them<00:05:27.900> on<00:05:28.020> because<00:05:28.650> they're<00:05:28.920> already

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
start them on because they're already

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.400 
start them on because they're already
you<00:05:29.520> should<00:05:29.940> already<00:05:30.180> be<00:05:30.300> used<00:05:30.630> to<00:05:30.780> writing

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:31.410 
you should already be used to writing

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:36.140 
you should already be used to writing
numbers<00:05:31.650> and<00:05:32.250> and<00:05:32.490> drawing<00:05:33.480> things<00:05:35.000> they<00:05:36.000> have

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
numbers and and drawing things they have

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.580 
numbers and and drawing things they have
to<00:05:36.270> do<00:05:36.390> with<00:05:36.510> alphabets<00:05:37.080> and<00:05:37.290> things<00:05:37.440> like

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:37.590 
to do with alphabets and things like

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:39.590 
to do with alphabets and things like
that<00:05:37.650> so<00:05:37.830> if<00:05:38.280> you<00:05:38.520> can<00:05:38.550> find<00:05:38.880> a<00:05:39.030> way<00:05:39.150> to<00:05:39.180> turn<00:05:39.570> a

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 
that so if you can find a way to turn a

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.910 
that so if you can find a way to turn a
letter<00:05:40.020> or<00:05:40.260> a<00:05:40.290> number<00:05:40.650> into<00:05:42.680> some<00:05:43.680> type<00:05:43.890> of

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:43.920 
letter or a number into some type of

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.820 
letter or a number into some type of
drawing<00:05:44.580> that'll<00:05:45.330> be<00:05:45.420> a<00:05:45.450> good<00:05:45.720> way<00:05:45.900> to<00:05:45.930> go<00:05:46.170> okay

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
drawing that'll be a good way to go okay

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.060 
drawing that'll be a good way to go okay
now<00:05:47.310> I'm<00:05:47.460> going<00:05:47.640> to<00:05:47.760> in<00:05:48.660> this<00:05:49.140> video<00:05:49.440> here<00:05:49.920> and
