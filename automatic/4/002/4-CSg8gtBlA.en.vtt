00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
an incredibly difficult problem so the

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.859 
an incredibly difficult problem so the
the<00:00:26.340> problem<00:00:26.699> that<00:00:26.730> I<00:00:26.849> have<00:00:27.150> here<00:00:27.420> is<00:00:27.570> very

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
the problem that I have here is very

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.230 
the problem that I have here is very
small<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.590> if<00:00:28.710> I<00:00:28.830> stay<00:00:29.010> on<00:00:29.039> top<00:00:29.400> of<00:00:29.429> it<00:00:29.640> I<00:00:29.820> think

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
small and if I stay on top of it I think

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.910 
small and if I stay on top of it I think
that's<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.570> key<00:00:30.779> is<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:31.050> just<00:00:31.109> stay<00:00:31.470> on<00:00:31.500> top<00:00:31.890> of

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
that's the key is to just stay on top of

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.970 
that's the key is to just stay on top of
them<00:00:32.189> if<00:00:32.309> you<00:00:32.430> start<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.180> see<00:00:33.390> some<00:00:33.980> eradicate

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
them if you start to see some eradicate

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.350

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.950 
them right away and get them out of your
garden<00:00:36.570> so<00:00:36.899> they<00:00:37.050> don't<00:00:37.260> breed<00:00:38.660> the<00:00:39.660> way<00:00:39.780> that

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
that I do it is I just I have I build a

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.770 
that I do it is I just I have I build a
little<00:00:56.309> trap<00:00:56.670> I<00:00:56.850> have<00:00:57.000> this<00:00:57.120> little<00:00:57.390> homemade

even have to clarify that did I but
anyways<00:01:25.170> they'll<00:01:25.350> take<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:25.590> though<00:01:25.680> they'll

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
anyways they'll take it though they'll

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.640 
anyways they'll take it though they'll
put<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.130> little<00:01:26.310> hole<00:01:26.750> and<00:01:27.750> now<00:01:28.020> they'll<00:01:28.259> still

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
put a little hole and now they'll still

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.550 
put a little hole and now they'll still
set<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:29.579> in<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.909> hole<00:01:29.939> so<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:31.079> it's<00:01:31.320> almost

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
set it in the hole so that it's almost

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.590 
set it in the hole so that it's almost
soil<00:01:31.950> level<00:01:32.280> so<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.579> slug<00:01:32.790> will<00:01:32.909> come<00:01:33.090> along

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
soil level so the slug will come along

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.810 
soil level so the slug will come along
it'll<00:01:34.560> be<00:01:34.650> attracted<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.250> beer<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:35.729> then

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
it'll be attracted to the beer and then

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.130 
it'll be attracted to the beer and then
it'll<00:01:35.939> kind<00:01:36.299> of<00:01:36.329> drop<00:01:36.570> into<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.900> beer<00:01:37.079> and

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
it'll kind of drop into the beer and

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.760 
it'll kind of drop into the beer and
it'll<00:01:37.350> drown<00:01:37.590> now<00:01:39.079> that's<00:01:40.079> worked<00:01:40.350> for<00:01:40.590> me<00:01:40.680> in

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
it'll drown now that's worked for me in

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.260 
it'll drown now that's worked for me in
the<00:01:40.860> past<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.280> actually<00:01:41.549> works<00:01:41.729> really<00:01:42.000> well

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
the past it actually works really well

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.429 
the past it actually works really well

gonna buy it for my slugs so I I heard

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.850 
gonna buy it for my slugs so I I heard
from<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.670> local<00:01:57.030> garden<00:01:57.240> group<00:01:57.600> that<00:01:57.860> people

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
from a local garden group that people

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.429 
from a local garden group that people
can<00:01:59.040> use<00:01:59.070> just<00:01:59.850> if<00:02:00.060> they<00:02:00.299> take<00:02:00.479> water<00:02:00.750> like

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
can use just if they take water like

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.380 
can use just if they take water like

teaspoon of yeast in it and a teaspoon

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.419 
teaspoon of yeast in it and a teaspoon
of<00:02:05.790> sugar<00:02:05.880> gonna<00:02:06.210> stir<00:02:06.450> it<00:02:06.570> up<00:02:06.659> and<00:02:06.899> then<00:02:07.110> put

of sugar gonna stir it up and then put

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:11.210 
of sugar gonna stir it up and then put
that<00:02:08.429> in<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.910> dish<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.420> will<00:02:10.200> attract<00:02:11.069> them

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
that in the dish that will attract them

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.430 
that in the dish that will attract them
also<00:02:11.430> because<00:02:11.790> I

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
also because I

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.550 
also because I
I'm<00:02:13.620> told<00:02:14.010> that<00:02:14.280> it's<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.910> it's<00:02:15.660> the<00:02:15.810> yeast<00:02:16.260> in

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
I'm told that it's the it's the yeast in

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.050 
I'm told that it's the it's the yeast in
the<00:02:16.710> beer<00:02:16.950> that<00:02:17.130> they're<00:02:17.280> attracted<00:02:17.460> to<00:02:17.760> not

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
the beer that they're attracted to not

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.960 
the beer that they're attracted to not
the<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.780> alcohol<00:02:19.380> itself<00:02:19.890> so<00:02:20.160> I<00:02:20.370> don't<00:02:20.850> think

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
the the alcohol itself so I don't think

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.730 
the the alcohol itself so I don't think
that<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.630> slugs<00:02:21.990> are<00:02:22.170> looking<00:02:22.590> for<00:02:22.710> a

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
that the the slugs are looking for a

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.020 
that the the slugs are looking for a
party<00:02:23.160> I<00:02:23.190> think<00:02:23.460> they're<00:02:23.550> just<00:02:23.640> looking<00:02:24.000> for

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
party I think they're just looking for

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.750 
party I think they're just looking for
for<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:24.840> yeast<00:02:25.080> and<00:02:25.320> so<00:02:25.500> what<00:02:26.430> I'm<00:02:26.520> gonna<00:02:26.670> try

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
for the yeast and so what I'm gonna try

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.960 
for the yeast and so what I'm gonna try
this<00:02:27.120> year<00:02:27.390> is<00:02:27.540> I'm<00:02:27.990> gonna<00:02:28.080> try<00:02:28.380> the<00:02:28.440> sugar<00:02:28.970> the

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
this year is I'm gonna try the sugar the

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.150 
this year is I'm gonna try the sugar the
sugar<00:02:30.000> of<00:02:30.390> water<00:02:30.630> and<00:02:30.900> yeast<00:02:31.140> solution<00:02:31.980> and

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
sugar of water and yeast solution and

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.020 
sugar of water and yeast solution and
see<00:02:32.280> what<00:02:32.370> I<00:02:32.430> come<00:02:32.520> up<00:02:32.640> with

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
see what I come up with

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.880 
see what I come up with
now<00:02:33.450> I<00:02:33.480> mixed<00:02:33.840> up<00:02:33.900> a<00:02:34.020> little<00:02:34.140> solution<00:02:34.620> here

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
now I mixed up a little solution here

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.830 
now I mixed up a little solution here
and<00:02:34.980> it's<00:02:35.130> it's<00:02:35.940> starting<00:02:36.270> to<00:02:36.360> foam<00:02:36.570> pretty

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
and it's it's starting to foam pretty

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.320 
and it's it's starting to foam pretty
good<00:02:37.080> so<00:02:37.380> there's<00:02:38.340> some<00:02:38.520> activity<00:02:38.970> going<00:02:39.210> on

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
good so there's some activity going on

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.000 
good so there's some activity going on
and<00:02:39.600> yeah<00:02:40.230> it<00:02:40.380> definitely<00:02:40.530> used<00:02:40.920> to

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
and yeah it definitely used to

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.070 
and yeah it definitely used to
definitely<00:02:41.310> smell<00:02:41.580> the<00:02:41.730> yeast<00:02:42.030> so<00:02:42.330> I'm<00:02:42.840> gonna

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
definitely smell the yeast so I'm gonna

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.900 
definitely smell the yeast so I'm gonna
give<00:02:43.230> it<00:02:43.260> a<00:02:43.350> go<00:02:43.500> now<00:02:43.740> there's<00:02:44.430> one<00:02:44.640> thing<00:02:44.670> to

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
give it a go now there's one thing to

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.280 
give it a go now there's one thing to
note<00:02:45.090> that<00:02:45.120> a<00:02:45.300> lot<00:02:45.390> of<00:02:45.540> people<00:02:45.840> when<00:02:45.960> they<00:02:45.990> make

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
note that a lot of people when they make

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.120 
note that a lot of people when they make
these<00:02:46.440> traps

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
these traps

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.760 
these traps
they'll<00:02:47.460> just<00:02:47.700> set<00:02:48.000> that<00:02:48.240> the<00:02:48.870> open<00:02:49.230> dish<00:02:49.440> down

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
they'll just set that the open dish down

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.240 
they'll just set that the open dish down
in<00:02:50.070> the<00:02:50.580> garden<00:02:50.940> and<00:02:51.090> then<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:52.680> problem<00:02:53.160> with

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
in the garden and then the problem with

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.830 
in the garden and then the problem with
that<00:02:53.370> is<00:02:53.610> whenever<00:02:53.820> it<00:02:54.120> rains<00:02:54.590> it<00:02:56.330> it<00:02:57.330> dilutes

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
that is whenever it rains it it dilutes

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.410 
that is whenever it rains it it dilutes
the<00:02:57.990> the<00:02:58.440> the<00:02:58.860> beer<00:02:59.220> and<00:02:59.400> then<00:02:59.880> you<00:03:00.120> have<00:03:00.270> to

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
the the the beer and then you have to

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.450 
the the the beer and then you have to
keep<00:03:00.540> adding<00:03:01.020> more<00:03:01.050> beer<00:03:01.380> all<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:01.590> time<00:03:01.800> now<00:03:02.430> I

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
keep adding more beer all the time now I

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:05.330 
keep adding more beer all the time now I

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
went out and I saw this beer trap that

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.430 
went out and I saw this beer trap that

had a lid on it and had a hole in the

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.920 
had a lid on it and had a hole in the
side<00:03:13.620> so<00:03:14.310> what<00:03:14.460> I've<00:03:14.580> done<00:03:14.760> is<00:03:14.820> I<00:03:15.150> after<00:03:15.780> more

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
side so what I've done is I after more

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.720 
side so what I've done is I after more
research<00:03:16.290> I've<00:03:16.470> come<00:03:16.650> up<00:03:16.770> with<00:03:16.800> a<00:03:17.160> different

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
research I've come up with a different

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.180 
research I've come up with a different
idea<00:03:17.820> that<00:03:18.300> that<00:03:19.020> I<00:03:19.380> think<00:03:19.530> is<00:03:19.770> gonna<00:03:19.950> work

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
idea that that I think is gonna work

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.000 
idea that that I think is gonna work
just<00:03:20.520> well<00:03:20.850> cuz<00:03:21.150> I've<00:03:21.480> used<00:03:21.810> the<00:03:22.050> the<00:03:22.500> ceramic

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
just well cuz I've used the the ceramic

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.380 
just well cuz I've used the the ceramic
ones<00:03:23.190> before<00:03:23.430> and<00:03:23.700> that<00:03:23.970> I<00:03:24.000> mean<00:03:24.270> they<00:03:24.360> just

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
ones before and that I mean they just

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:25.760 
ones before and that I mean they just
they<00:03:24.690> work<00:03:24.870> wonderful<00:03:25.350> that<00:03:25.470> they<00:03:25.590> work

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
they work wonderful that they work

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.590 
they work wonderful that they work
really<00:03:25.980> good<00:03:26.190> but<00:03:26.760> there<00:03:26.910> is<00:03:27.060> really<00:03:27.420> no

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
really good but there is really no

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.170 
really good but there is really no
reason<00:03:27.780> why<00:03:28.170> you<00:03:28.230> can't<00:03:28.739> build<00:03:29.580> your<00:03:29.640> own<00:03:29.790> that

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
reason why you can't build your own that

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.790 
reason why you can't build your own that
has<00:03:30.330> a<00:03:30.360> cover<00:03:30.660> on<00:03:30.840> it<00:03:30.870> so<00:03:31.020> the<00:03:31.230> rain<00:03:31.410> doesn't

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
has a cover on it so the rain doesn't

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.290 
has a cover on it so the rain doesn't
affect<00:03:32.160> it<00:03:32.310> so<00:03:32.670> what<00:03:32.790> I've<00:03:32.910> done<00:03:33.030> is<00:03:33.090> I've

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
affect it so what I've done is I've

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.220 
affect it so what I've done is I've
taken<00:03:33.480> a<00:03:34.459> butter<00:03:35.459> dish<00:03:35.520> and<00:03:35.970> now<00:03:36.510> I<00:03:36.540> took<00:03:37.140> a

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
taken a butter dish and now I took a

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.880 
taken a butter dish and now I took a
hole<00:03:37.440> saw<00:03:37.770> and<00:03:38.390> drilled<00:03:39.390> for<00:03:40.080> one<00:03:40.680> and<00:03:40.830> a<00:03:40.860> half

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
hole saw and drilled for one and a half

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.090 
hole saw and drilled for one and a half
inch<00:03:41.280> holes<00:03:41.550> around<00:03:42.000> toward<00:03:42.360> the<00:03:42.480> top<00:03:42.720> and

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
inch holes around toward the top and

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.680 
inch holes around toward the top and
then<00:03:44.100> now<00:03:44.640> you<00:03:44.700> don't<00:03:45.120> have<00:03:45.239> to<00:03:45.360> use<00:03:45.480> a<00:03:45.510> hole

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
then now you don't have to use a hole

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.390 
then now you don't have to use a hole
saw<00:03:45.720> of<00:03:45.930> course<00:03:46.080> you<00:03:46.260> could<00:03:46.440> just<00:03:46.680> take<00:03:47.220> an

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
saw of course you could just take an

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.330 
saw of course you could just take an
inch<00:03:47.700> and<00:03:47.880> a<00:03:47.910> half<00:03:47.940> or<00:03:48.300> so<00:03:48.450> and<00:03:48.480> just<00:03:48.750> use<00:03:48.989> a<00:03:49.340> box

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
inch and a half or so and just use a box

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.070 
inch and a half or so and just use a box
knife<00:03:50.640> if<00:03:50.880> you're<00:03:51.030> really<00:03:51.180> careful<00:03:51.600> and<00:03:51.660> you

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
knife if you're really careful and you

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.170 
knife if you're really careful and you
can<00:03:52.260> cut<00:03:52.470> the<00:03:52.590> holes<00:03:52.769> out<00:03:52.980> now<00:03:53.670> I<00:03:53.730> don't<00:03:53.880> know

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
can cut the holes out now I don't know

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.759 
can cut the holes out now I don't know
if<00:03:54.360> these<00:03:54.540> are<00:03:54.600> these<00:03:55.200> are<00:03:55.230> a<00:03:55.350> little<00:03:55.590> bit

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
if these are these are a little bit

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.650 
if these are these are a little bit
bigger<00:03:56.010> than<00:03:56.700> the<00:03:56.880> ones<00:03:57.060> I<00:03:57.180> had<00:03:57.360> with<00:03:57.540> the

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
bigger than the ones I had with the

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.110 
bigger than the ones I had with the
little<00:03:57.900> porcelain<00:03:58.110> traps<00:03:58.620> so<00:03:59.400> you<00:03:59.790> know<00:03:59.910> maybe

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
little porcelain traps so you know maybe

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.990 
little porcelain traps so you know maybe
an<00:04:00.330> inch<00:04:00.600> would<00:04:01.050> be<00:04:01.230> good<00:04:01.440> but<00:04:02.190> I<00:04:02.430> didn't<00:04:02.820> have

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
an inch would be good but I didn't have

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.300 
an inch would be good but I didn't have
an<00:04:03.690> inch<00:04:04.080> holes<00:04:04.530> like<00:04:04.769> well<00:04:04.950> I<00:04:04.980> have<00:04:05.190> one<00:04:05.250> I

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.790 
an inch holes like well I have one I
couldn't<00:04:05.790> find<00:04:05.940> it<00:04:06.120> and<00:04:06.239> so<00:04:06.360> lazy<00:04:07.140> me<00:04:07.440> didn't

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:07.800 
couldn't find it and so lazy me didn't

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.020 
couldn't find it and so lazy me didn't
want<00:04:07.890> to<00:04:08.010> cut<00:04:08.160> it<00:04:08.220> out<00:04:08.310> with<00:04:08.370> a<00:04:08.459> box<00:04:08.670> knife<00:04:08.880> so<00:04:09.000> I

will set this into

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.120 
will set this into
the<00:04:27.240> raised<00:04:27.690> bed<00:04:28.020> up<00:04:28.230> to<00:04:28.500> the<00:04:28.650> bottom<00:04:28.949> of<00:04:29.070> the

will<00:04:34.290> give<00:04:34.680> it<00:04:34.770> a<00:04:34.830> try<00:04:34.980> and<00:04:35.100> I<00:04:35.190> think<00:04:35.220> I<00:04:35.580> think

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:35.639 
will give it a try and I think I think

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:37.820 
will give it a try and I think I think
this<00:04:36.000> is<00:04:36.180> I<00:04:36.419> think<00:04:36.960> this<00:04:37.229> is<00:04:37.290> gonna<00:04:37.530> work<00:04:37.770> just

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
this is I think this is gonna work just

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.700 
this is I think this is gonna work just
perfectly<00:04:38.430> so<00:04:38.750> I'm<00:04:39.750> gonna<00:04:39.960> set<00:04:40.229> that<00:04:40.260> in<00:04:40.560> there

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
perfectly so I'm gonna set that in there

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.780 
perfectly so I'm gonna set that in there
and<00:04:41.660> see<00:04:42.660> how<00:04:42.780> it<00:04:42.870> works<00:04:43.080> and<00:04:43.580> you<00:04:44.580> know<00:04:44.669> of

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
and see how it works and you know of

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.030 
and see how it works and you know of
course<00:04:44.850> you<00:04:45.120> know<00:04:45.210> what's<00:04:45.360> gonna<00:04:45.449> happen<00:04:46.040> I'm

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
around here because I went through the

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.810 
around here because I went through the
process<00:04:54.570> of<00:04:54.930> doing<00:04:55.350> this<00:04:55.650> but<00:04:55.919> anyways<00:04:56.669> I've

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 
process of doing this but anyways I've

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.189 
process of doing this but anyways I've
caught<00:04:57.030> him<00:04:57.060> in<00:04:57.240> the<00:04:57.330> past<00:04:57.540> and<00:04:57.750> I'm<00:04:57.840> I'm

00:04:58.189 --> 00:04:58.199 
caught him in the past and I'm I'm

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:00.100 
caught him in the past and I'm I'm
pretty<00:04:58.440> sure<00:04:58.650> as<00:04:58.800> the<00:04:58.979> season<00:04:59.310> progresses<00:04:59.700> and

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
pretty sure as the season progresses and

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.110 
pretty sure as the season progresses and
as<00:05:01.110> you<00:05:01.620> know<00:05:01.710> we<00:05:01.919> get<00:05:02.250> our<00:05:02.400> rains<00:05:02.639> and<00:05:02.910> things

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
as you know we get our rains and things

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.370 
as you know we get our rains and things
like<00:05:03.270> that<00:05:03.479> I<00:05:03.510> think<00:05:03.600> the<00:05:03.870> slugs<00:05:04.139> are<00:05:04.260> gonna

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380 
like that I think the slugs are gonna

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.670 
like that I think the slugs are gonna
come<00:05:04.620> out<00:05:04.710> in<00:05:04.740> full<00:05:05.010> force
