00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.599
 hello this is music theory in 5 minutes 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.210
 and today we are going to learn one of the 

00:00:06.599 --> 00:00:11.910
 most basic and most used resources 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.290
 for improvisation that is the one of the 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.030
 scales 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.130
 The first thing to know is that the 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:20.640
 scales are very much related to the 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.640
 chords 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.970
 in fact each accord corresponds to 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:28.519
 a scale 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.720
 sometimes more but let's say the most basic 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:33.760
 one 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:37.679
 to a major chord 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.679
 corresponds to the major scale 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:47.490
 for example in 2 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:50.010
 do re my fa sun yes and if we find 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:52.440
 in some piece a major chord we can 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.780
 use the sought after one of the most basic 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.450
 it is the minor chord 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.790
 to this correspond two options 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:03.310
 it can be the doric mode 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:05.540
 that from two would be re re my 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:11.300
 flat 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:15.010
 Sun the B flat and 2 and the other option is 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.010
 the natural minor scale 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:26.060
 that from two would be d re flat 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:29.280
 only the flat B flat and 2 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.909
 another of the most common chords 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.859
 in popular music 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.859
 is the agreement decreased 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.600
 here on the scale that we can use 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.600
 is the way I think 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.880
 from two would be two rememore my 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:54.020
 flat 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:54.020
 Sun we see the flat B flat and 2 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:01.390
 the seventh or dominant record 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.250
 here the most common is to use the mix mode or 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.480
 language 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:12.300
 from two would be from me 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:14.640
 Sun the B flat and now let's see a 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.400
 small example of how we would apply 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.790
 these scales that we relate to 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:25.460
 the chords if in some song x we 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.460
 we find this encryption for example 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:40.740
 we have d minor 7 7 2 7 and 2 sharp 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.870
 diminished 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:46.850
 when we have here the d minor 7 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.850
 we can use the doric scale 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.520
 in that historical case of king 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:58.030
 when we meet the sun 7 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:02.400
 we use the mix or libia scale 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:05.519
 in this case it would be mix or lidia de sol 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:11.209
 when we meet with 2007 we can 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:11.209
 use the larger scale of do 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:17.900
 and when we met this diminished 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.900
 we can use it creates it 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.740
 he creates it from two sharps 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.830
 Now let's do a little exercise 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:30.870
 so you can apply this 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:33.830
 ratio of scales and chords 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.830
 I 'm going to leave you 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.190
 to decrease we are 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.860
 and I'm going to give you some good little minutes 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.980
 a few seconds so that right now by 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:58.440
 please relate what scale you 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.830
 corresponds to each of these runs 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.830
 weather 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:13.990
 and ready 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.250
 as you should already know 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.250
 corresponds to the major scale 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.490
 we see it very well 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.450
 to this as you should already know 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.450
 corresponds he creates it 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:32.910
 one to this as surely as you 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:34.550
 they accepted it's up to a mixon 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:38.820
 of 2 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:42.290
 and this one also had it well 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.290
 this was the tonic 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.470
 natural minor 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:51.950
 let 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.410
 good was everything for today I hope that you 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:59.080
 Serve a lot if you liked share what 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:59.080
 subscribe and see you in the next
