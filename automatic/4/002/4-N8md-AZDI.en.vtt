00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
this was adorable and also has a I never

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.359 
this was adorable and also has a I never
know<00:01:48.689> if<00:01:48.810> it's<00:01:48.960> a<00:01:49.049> Razorback<00:01:49.619> or<00:01:49.890> racerback

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
know if it's a Razorback or racerback

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.179 
know if it's a Razorback or racerback
but<00:01:50.939> I<00:01:50.970> think<00:01:51.240> it's<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.450> Razorback<00:01:51.990> so<00:01:52.890> it<00:01:53.040> just

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
but I think it's a Razorback so it just

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.999 
but I think it's a Razorback so it just
goes<00:01:53.280> like<00:01:53.490> that<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:54.409> I'm<00:01:55.409> not<00:01:55.560> sure<00:01:55.590> how<00:01:55.890> much

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
goes like that and I'm not sure how much

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.289 
goes like that and I'm not sure how much
