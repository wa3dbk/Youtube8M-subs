00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:21.490
 and then maybe I'll talk here I'll go 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.009
 show some places to hide 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.960
 mutants things in places like this 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:28.750
 that it will be difficult for him to think of 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:31.419
 pick up but I think in zena mode it's 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:34.480
 It's hard for you to hide, so it's better. 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:37.000
 the penalty will stay in the open place for 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.970
 extension to all mutants with this 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.960
 past that jump over the map has a 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:46.270
 place it around the rose that these places 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.579
 Hidden, do you think? 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.699
 But it's still good for you to become an x 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:52.749
 so here one day go up there father 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:55.089
 behind right 

00:00:52.749 --> 00:00:58.269
 I gave two jumped to lose with it too 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:01:00.429
 That's the way it tightens space 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:03.820
 there when your way to the gallows on the ground 

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:05.590
 You plan one more time , there you go. 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:09.190
 give a second impulse is to do against 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:11.710
 it under various tutorials there on youtube is 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.720
 only you look there and see the image of this 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.510
 it gives me to go 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.120
 I will not do it here, you will not go there. 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.290
 I'm just going to show you how the type comes. 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.530
 at the tip 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:26.200
 clothing that comes on the tip and spring shift and 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.480
 start singing ws very fast 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.340
 or you just hold shift with safe 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.700
 gabriela and also in the tip 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:36.210
 it will sink then you would put half 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.399
 and then find it in the middle of the shirt to 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.890
 Haiti and will seek neither who is the marginal 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:46.119
 that goes from l someone spend even people 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:48.450
 is looking for part of the same here 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:48.450
 O 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.229
 here is also good, but I think 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.850
 It's better when there are a lot of people like that. 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:55.689
 For me I'm going to have to go through 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.310
 there 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:02:03.069
 put it behind him here you in 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.830
 Up the plate where I'm good, little chatinha. 

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:09.369
 of 20 types and almost falls out more 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:11.980
 you fall on top of it and in that source is a 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.200
 great place right there on top of it but need 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.299
 someone's the box for you 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.540
 then you only define the person and do not have 

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:21.390
 discussion you ask to leave the 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:26.130
 Face needs you and up there and 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:29.250
 Right, right, you from underneath. 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:33.230
 the first time that the recording consumes 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:36.870
 so if you have one in each competitor 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:39.810
 You can say that these're horrible Meton 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.510
 things I will respect until she 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.670
 Tell him not to end up improving and already 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.580
 I 'm making goals and now I have 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:51.660
 who know your street playing around 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:54.360
 good and I fail because of the time also of the 26 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.910
 I think five minutes is good 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:01.200
 The kind of blow this guy makes a game. 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:02.910
 front 20 minutes 30 times and then starts 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.610
 do too long 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:09.420
 but then here but the plate that I am is 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:12.360
 good climb only give little against type 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.310
 if you have new ones and copy you will jump and 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:20.150
 squeeze against him he jumps a little 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:23.760
 higher according to the original Kazakhstan 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.770
 Alice is also good but I do not like it 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.900
 how many people can if not this is 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.000
 a mutant virus was already all seen 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.540
 also 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.349
 daniel 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:36.959
 everybody runs off here in the cage is 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:41.340
 cool to come here but when you have partner 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:44.719
 was an important dissertation type only 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:50.159
 talk ends it falls there easy to handle 

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:52.500
 here where I'm going, you've got to 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:55.049
 up there like I was staying on tip 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:58.159
 Just ask again because you see there. 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:04:01.709
 you go on tip if it comes up said 

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:04.160
 explaining from the bs until hope falls on 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:08.510
 corner and no longer 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:11.930
 the angel then more there 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:15.590
 In fact I was complaining, let's go. 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:17.510
 I'm only here to go out in English, is this? 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:21.970
 here you do not have insurance from above abriesp 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.970
 popular here is on top of these box 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.890
 the line of the marginal is there is also good 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:30.320
 I just do not know how he went up alone. 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:33.680
 everything with a partner the only way to 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:36.800
 chance alone would be jumping there from 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:44.129
 Up and falling but I think it was going to be 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:47.729
 It's difficult for them to have the air brush 

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:49.860
 I think he's much better than the hero. 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:52.409
 it's normal in hero mode 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:55.199
 the only thing this one has no gun 

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:59.189
 so I find it boring that the 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:05:01.589
 another to it can protect the attacks 

00:04:59.189 --> 00:05:03.539
 that there no longer he goes up must 

00:05:01.589 --> 00:05:06.119
 take care to stab yourself 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:12.889
 especially the second one if he misses 

00:05:06.119 --> 00:05:12.889
 Even he adjusts his hand again.
