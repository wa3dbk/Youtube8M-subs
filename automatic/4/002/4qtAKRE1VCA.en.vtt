00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
six months but I wanted something that

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.810 
six months but I wanted something that
looked<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.859> little<00:00:58.920> bit<00:00:59.129> more<00:00:59.190> professional

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
looked a little bit more professional

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:00.830 
looked a little bit more professional
now<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.239> there's<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.390> little<00:01:00.510> bit<00:01:00.629> safe

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
now and there's a little bit safe

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.720 
now and there's a little bit safe
because<00:01:01.109> this<00:01:01.350> can<00:01:01.620> be<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.800> little<00:01:02.010> bit<00:01:02.219> flimsy

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
because this can be a little bit flimsy

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.729 
because this can be a little bit flimsy
puts<00:01:03.660> too<00:01:03.750> much<00:01:03.780> weight<00:01:04.049> on<00:01:04.229> top<00:01:04.409> of<00:01:04.589> there<00:01:04.710> and

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
puts too much weight on top of there and

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.140 
puts too much weight on top of there and
it<00:01:05.010> could<00:01:05.129> go<00:01:05.339> through<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.760> damage<00:01:06.060> the

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
it could go through and damage the

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.810 
it could go through and damage the

my battery's charged I have the cables
put<00:04:50.910> in<00:04:51.000> outside<00:04:51.450> the<00:04:51.630> box<00:04:51.840> so<00:04:52.470> that<00:04:52.500> means

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
put in outside the box so that means

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.920 
put in outside the box so that means
they're<00:04:52.890> ready<00:04:52.980> to<00:04:53.190> come<00:04:53.340> out<00:04:53.810> obviously<00:04:54.810> I've

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
they're ready to come out obviously I've

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.660 
they're ready to come out obviously I've
got<00:04:55.080> my<00:04:55.200> lipo<00:04:55.560> checker<00:04:55.830> so<00:04:56.100> can<00:04:56.280> check<00:04:56.460> them<00:04:56.580> on

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:56.670 
got my lipo checker so can check them on

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:58.970 
got my lipo checker so can check them on
there<00:04:56.910> but<00:04:57.660> this<00:04:58.140> is<00:04:58.320> just<00:04:58.500> a<00:04:58.590> quick<00:04:58.770> reference

00:04:58.970 --> 00:04:58.980 
there but this is just a quick reference

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.190 
there but this is just a quick reference
for<00:04:59.250> me<00:04:59.490> I<00:04:59.640> could<00:05:00.180> go<00:05:00.270> along<00:05:00.420> and<00:05:00.780> go<00:05:00.930> right

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 
for me I could go along and go right

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.680 
for me I could go along and go right
that's<00:05:01.410> ready<00:05:01.590> it's<00:05:01.740> clamped<00:05:01.950> its<00:05:02.700> cables

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
that's ready it's clamped its cables

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.330 
that's ready it's clamped its cables
pointing<00:05:04.020> out<00:05:04.140> and<00:05:04.410> then<00:05:04.710> when<00:05:04.830> I've<00:05:04.920> used<00:05:05.130> it

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
pointing out and then when I've used it

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.430 
pointing out and then when I've used it
I<00:05:05.520> always<00:05:05.940> put<00:05:06.120> them<00:05:06.210> in<00:05:06.390> like<00:05:07.020> this<00:05:07.230> so<00:05:07.350> the

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
I always put them in like this so the

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.590 
I always put them in like this so the
cables<00:05:07.800> are<00:05:07.920> pointing<00:05:08.220> in<00:05:08.460> that<00:05:08.700> means<00:05:09.300> you

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 
cables are pointing in that means you

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.990 
cables are pointing in that means you
know<00:05:09.690> cables<00:05:10.140> stay<00:05:10.320> in<00:05:10.530> batteries<00:05:11.130> flat<00:05:11.370> don't

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
know cables stay in batteries flat don't

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.580 
know cables stay in batteries flat don't
use<00:05:12.240> it<00:05:12.420> and<00:05:12.510> I<00:05:12.570> can<00:05:12.720> go<00:05:12.840> to<00:05:12.900> the<00:05:13.110> next<00:05:13.290> one

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
use it and I can go to the next one

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.310 
use it and I can go to the next one
that's<00:05:13.950> just<00:05:14.100> one<00:05:14.250> way<00:05:14.400> I<00:05:14.780> keep<00:05:15.780> on<00:05:15.900> top<00:05:16.110> of<00:05:16.140> my

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
that's just one way I keep on top of my

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.320 
that's just one way I keep on top of my
batteries<00:05:16.770> and<00:05:17.040> don't<00:05:17.550> don't<00:05:17.760> accidentally

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
batteries and don't don't accidentally

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:19.940
