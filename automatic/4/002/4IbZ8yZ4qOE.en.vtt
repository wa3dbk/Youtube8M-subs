00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.590 
at that period so I think now i don't
know<00:05:12.070> if<00:05:12.130> it's<00:05:12.340> so<00:05:12.520> much<00:05:12.700> sci-fi<00:05:13.300> or<00:05:13.360> the

make<00:05:54.160> it<00:05:54.250> better<00:05:54.460> um<00:05:54.940> I<00:05:55.570> think<00:05:55.930> what<00:05:56.260> it<00:05:56.350> does

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:56.560 
make it better um I think what it does

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.200 
make it better um I think what it does
is<00:05:56.770> it<00:05:56.800> captures<00:05:57.280> a<00:05:57.340> whole<00:05:57.520> chunk<00:05:57.820> of<00:05:58.060> our

00:05:58.200 --> 00:05:58.210 
is it captures a whole chunk of our

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:00.660 
is it captures a whole chunk of our
psyche<00:05:58.720> epic<00:05:59.050> is<00:05:59.110> the<00:05:59.260> oldest<00:05:59.650> poetry<00:06:00.460> form

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:00.670 
psyche epic is the oldest poetry form

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:02.700 
psyche epic is the oldest poetry form
right<00:06:00.880> we<00:06:01.060> we<00:06:01.450> had<00:06:01.600> the<00:06:01.870> Iliad<00:06:02.230> we<00:06:02.470> had<00:06:02.590> the

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:02.710 
right we we had the Iliad we had the

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:04.380 
right we we had the Iliad we had the
Odyssey<00:06:03.040> no<00:06:03.430> we<00:06:03.610> ended<00:06:03.850> up<00:06:03.910> with<00:06:04.030> their<00:06:04.180> need

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:04.390 
Odyssey no we ended up with their need

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:06.660 
Odyssey no we ended up with their need
and<00:06:04.600> so<00:06:05.020> on<00:06:05.110> we<00:06:05.290> want<00:06:05.560> a<00:06:05.680> big<00:06:05.920> story<00:06:06.250> we<00:06:06.550> want

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:06.670 
and so on we want a big story we want

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:08.700 
and so on we want a big story we want
monsters<00:06:07.270> we<00:06:07.660> want<00:06:07.690> God's<00:06:08.140> we<00:06:08.530> want

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:08.710 
monsters we want God's we want

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:10.770 
monsters we want God's we want
superheroes<00:06:09.430> ice<00:06:09.700> is<00:06:09.820> pure<00:06:10.030> escape<00:06:10.300> so<00:06:10.600> I

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:10.780 
superheroes ice is pure escape so I

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:12.780 
superheroes ice is pure escape so I
think<00:06:10.900> it's<00:06:11.230> just<00:06:11.470> it<00:06:11.650> must<00:06:12.100> tap<00:06:12.580> into

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:12.790 
think it's just it must tap into

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:14.400 
think it's just it must tap into
something<00:06:13.210> really<00:06:13.390> really<00:06:13.630> primitive<00:06:13.930> when

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:14.410 
something really really primitive when

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:17.220 
something really really primitive when
at<00:06:15.010> the<00:06:15.070> end<00:06:15.160> of<00:06:15.460> for<00:06:15.820> example<00:06:15.850> season<00:06:16.540> 2<00:06:16.780> Buffy

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:17.230 
at the end of for example season 2 Buffy

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:19.680 
at the end of for example season 2 Buffy
when<00:06:17.860> she<00:06:18.070> has<00:06:18.190> to<00:06:18.340> kill<00:06:18.550> angel<00:06:19.000> in<00:06:19.150> order<00:06:19.660> to

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:19.690 
when she has to kill angel in order to

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:21.180 
when she has to kill angel in order to
stop<00:06:19.990> the<00:06:20.140> end<00:06:20.290> of<00:06:20.410> the<00:06:20.470> world<00:06:20.590> from<00:06:20.770> happening

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:21.190 
stop the end of the world from happening

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:23.400 
stop the end of the world from happening
that's<00:06:21.700> exactly<00:06:22.180> what<00:06:22.330> happens<00:06:22.630> in<00:06:22.810> book<00:06:23.140> four

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:23.410

that's exactly what happens in book four

form<00:06:56.949> of<00:06:57.039> community<00:06:57.490> I<00:06:57.550> think<00:06:57.789> you're<00:06:57.879> right

form of community I think you're right
it's<00:06:58.180> a<00:06:58.240> brilliant<00:06:58.449> simple<00:06:59.020> concept<00:06:59.469> around

00:06:59.670 --> 00:06:59.680 
it's a brilliant simple concept around

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.709 
it's a brilliant simple concept around
which<00:06:59.889> to<00:07:00.069> construct<00:07:00.550> the<00:07:00.789> whole<00:07:01.000> drama<00:07:01.300> and

00:07:01.709 --> 00:07:01.719 
which to construct the whole drama and

00:07:01.719 --> 00:07:03.629 
which to construct the whole drama and
we<00:07:02.199> always<00:07:02.530> think<00:07:02.680> that<00:07:02.830> we<00:07:02.949> want<00:07:03.159> to<00:07:03.310> know<00:07:03.430> but

00:07:03.629 --> 00:07:03.639 
we always think that we want to know but

00:07:03.639 --> 00:07:05.189 
we always think that we want to know but
that<00:07:03.759> knowledge<00:07:04.120> never<00:07:04.330> really<00:07:04.719> leads<00:07:04.960> us

00:07:05.189 --> 00:07:05.199 
that knowledge never really leads us

00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:06.899 
that knowledge never really leads us
anywhere<00:07:06.009> I<00:07:06.280> mean<00:07:06.550> there's<00:07:06.699> a<00:07:06.729> wonderful

00:07:06.899 --> 00:07:06.909 
anywhere I mean there's a wonderful

00:07:06.909 --> 00:07:08.909 
anywhere I mean there's a wonderful
story<00:07:07.240> by<00:07:07.479> Ouspensky<00:07:08.139> where<00:07:08.319> a<00:07:08.349> guy's<00:07:08.680> about

00:07:08.909 --> 00:07:08.919 
story by Ouspensky where a guy's about

00:07:08.919 --> 00:07:10.589 
story by Ouspensky where a guy's about
to<00:07:08.979> be<00:07:09.159> murdered<00:07:09.340> for<00:07:09.939> killing<00:07:10.210> someone<00:07:10.330> else

00:07:10.589 --> 00:07:10.599 
to be murdered for killing someone else

00:07:10.599 --> 00:07:11.909 
to be murdered for killing someone else
he<00:07:10.750> says<00:07:10.900> if<00:07:10.990> only<00:07:11.229> I<00:07:11.289> could<00:07:11.469> have<00:07:11.560> my<00:07:11.710> life

00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:11.919 
he says if only I could have my life

00:07:11.919 --> 00:07:13.529 
he says if only I could have my life
again<00:07:12.250> how<00:07:12.580> different<00:07:12.849> it<00:07:13.120> would<00:07:13.210> be<00:07:13.330> in<00:07:13.449> an

00:07:13.529 --> 00:07:13.539 
again how different it would be in an

00:07:13.539 --> 00:07:14.879 
again how different it would be in an
angel<00:07:13.870> comes<00:07:13.990> down<00:07:14.259> and<00:07:14.439> says<00:07:14.469> habit<00:07:14.800> again

00:07:14.879 --> 00:07:14.889 
angel comes down and says habit again

00:07:14.889 --> 00:07:16.860 
angel comes down and says habit again
and<00:07:15.250> at<00:07:15.550> the<00:07:15.639> end<00:07:15.669> of<00:07:15.909> course<00:07:16.180> he's<00:07:16.330> waiting<00:07:16.719> to

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:16.870 
and at the end of course he's waiting to

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:18.149 
and at the end of course he's waiting to
be<00:07:16.990> murdered<00:07:17.139> for<00:07:17.500> killing<00:07:17.710> so<00:07:17.830> the<00:07:17.949> thing

00:07:18.149 --> 00:07:18.159 
be murdered for killing so the thing

00:07:18.159 --> 00:07:20.369 
be murdered for killing so the thing
repeats<00:07:18.610> endlessly<00:07:19.330> it's<00:07:19.539> a<00:07:19.599> repeating<00:07:20.110> world

00:07:20.369 --> 00:07:20.379 
repeats endlessly it's a repeating world

00:07:20.379 --> 00:07:22.290 
repeats endlessly it's a repeating world
so<00:07:20.889> I<00:07:20.919> think<00:07:21.069> the<00:07:21.219> idea<00:07:21.370> that<00:07:21.639> forward

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:22.300 
so I think the idea that forward

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:24.360 
so I think the idea that forward
knowledge<00:07:22.659> can<00:07:22.900> somehow<00:07:23.139> free<00:07:23.830> you<00:07:24.039> from<00:07:24.310> your

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:24.370 
knowledge can somehow free you from your

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:26.399 
knowledge can somehow free you from your
own<00:07:24.580> condition<00:07:25.150> is<00:07:25.330> entirely<00:07:25.719> false<00:07:26.139> but

00:07:26.399 --> 00:07:26.409 
own condition is entirely false but

00:07:26.409 --> 00:07:28.200 
own condition is entirely false but
still<00:07:26.620> we<00:07:26.740> cling<00:07:26.979> to<00:07:27.219> it<00:07:27.370> and<00:07:27.789> of<00:07:27.909> course<00:07:27.969> of

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:28.210 
still we cling to it and of course of

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:29.790 
still we cling to it and of course of
course<00:07:28.300> that<00:07:28.719> is<00:07:28.840> what<00:07:28.960> we're<00:07:29.080> being<00:07:29.199> sold<00:07:29.529> in

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:29.800 
course that is what we're being sold in

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.800 
course that is what we're being sold in
fast<00:07:30.340> forward<00:07:30.610> the<00:07:30.909> forward<00:07:31.300> knowledge<00:07:31.569> might

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:31.810 
fast forward the forward knowledge might

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:34.140 
fast forward the forward knowledge might
or<00:07:31.990> might<00:07:32.020> not<00:07:32.279> release<00:07:33.279> us<00:07:33.460> from<00:07:33.490> our<00:07:33.759> future

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:34.150 
or might not release us from our future

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:35.850 
or might not release us from our future
I<00:07:34.360> think<00:07:34.659> what<00:07:34.779> you're<00:07:34.900> also<00:07:35.020> kind<00:07:35.289> of<00:07:35.409> say<00:07:35.560> two

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:35.860 
I think what you're also kind of say two

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:37.350 
I think what you're also kind of say two
is<00:07:36.069> like<00:07:36.250> you've<00:07:36.400> had<00:07:36.550> two<00:07:36.729> thousand<00:07:37.150> years<00:07:37.300> of

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:37.360 
is like you've had two thousand years of

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.029 
is like you've had two thousand years of
religion<00:07:37.810> and<00:07:38.020> I<00:07:38.110> think<00:07:38.289> the<00:07:38.379> next<00:07:38.409> thousand

00:07:39.029 --> 00:07:39.039 
religion and I think the next thousand

00:07:39.039 --> 00:07:40.170 
religion and I think the next thousand
years<00:07:39.069> are<00:07:39.250> going<00:07:39.340> to<00:07:39.400> be<00:07:39.460> about<00:07:39.610> mysticism

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:40.180 
years are going to be about mysticism

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:44.510 
years are going to be about mysticism
because<00:07:41.020> people<00:07:41.080> could<00:07:41.469> get<00:07:41.560> into<00:07:41.919> a<00:07:41.949> little

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:44.520 

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:48.390 

say<00:07:45.520> you're<00:07:46.240> gonna<00:07:46.449> see<00:07:46.599> vampires<00:07:47.400> werewolves

00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:48.400 
say you're gonna see vampires werewolves

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.580 
say you're gonna see vampires werewolves
