Leonard here okay I just got my

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.560 
Leonard here okay I just got my
crossfire<00:00:06.660> intake<00:00:07.230> system<00:00:07.790> in<00:00:08.790> from<00:00:09.120> Adrienne

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
crossfire intake system in from Adrienne

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.690 
crossfire intake system in from Adrienne
and<00:00:11.210> installed<00:00:12.210> it<00:00:12.360> on<00:00:12.450> a<00:00:12.509> stock<00:00:12.870> motor<00:00:13.700> and

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
and installed it on a stock motor and

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.349 
and installed it on a stock motor and
this<00:00:15.269> is<00:00:15.509> basically<00:00:15.809> what<00:00:16.470> it<00:00:16.619> looks<00:00:16.890> like

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:17.359 
this is basically what it looks like

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:19.790 
this is basically what it looks like
this<00:00:18.359> is<00:00:18.570> set<00:00:18.810> up<00:00:18.930> for<00:00:19.170> adelardo

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
this is set up for adelardo

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.830 
this is set up for adelardo
or<00:00:20.010> a<00:00:20.039> weber<00:00:21.680> carburetor<00:00:23.210> throttle<00:00:24.210> linkage

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
or a weber carburetor throttle linkage

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.439 
or a weber carburetor throttle linkage
is<00:00:28.279> fitted<00:00:29.279> right<00:00:29.460> on<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.910> there<00:00:30.060> so<00:00:30.240> you<00:00:30.330> don't

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
is fitted right on to there so you don't

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.380 
is fitted right on to there so you don't
have<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.750> fool<00:00:30.900> around<00:00:31.050> with<00:00:31.230> an<00:00:31.410> any<00:00:31.560> linkage

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
have to fool around with an any linkage

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.600 
have to fool around with an any linkage
this<00:00:33.390> hooks<00:00:33.660> right<00:00:33.870> up

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
this hooks right up

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:43.869 
this hooks right up
there's<00:00:35.610> your<00:00:35.880> normal<00:00:36.210> wire<00:00:36.390> hook<00:00:36.719> up<00:00:36.899> rat

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:43.879 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:46.729 

basically<00:00:44.879> I<00:00:45.180> had<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.690> preheat<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.350> tubes<00:00:46.590> a

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
basically I had to preheat the tubes a

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.029 
basically I had to preheat the tubes a
little<00:00:46.980> bit<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:48.289> line<00:00:49.289> them<00:00:49.469> up<00:00:49.590> so<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:49.860> could

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
little bit to line them up so I could

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:56.150 
little bit to line them up so I could
put<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:51.680> the<00:00:52.680> hoses<00:00:53.070> on<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:54.800> can<00:00:55.800> get<00:00:55.920> back

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
put the the hoses on it I can get back

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.670 
put the the hoses on it I can get back
far<00:00:56.489> enough<00:00:56.520> there<00:00:57.510> give<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.410> good<00:00:58.559> idea

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
far enough there give you a good idea

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.520 
far enough there give you a good idea
what<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.190> looks<00:00:59.399> like

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.280 

that's<00:01:05.370> it<00:01:05.640> there's<00:01:05.880> your<00:01:06.060> crossfire<00:01:06.330> intake

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
that's it there's your crossfire intake

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.570 
that's it there's your crossfire intake
system<00:01:09.350> and<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.530> flange<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:10.980> a<00:01:11.130> pretty<00:01:11.370> thick

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
system and the flange is a pretty thick

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.880 
system and the flange is a pretty thick
they're<00:01:11.820> about<00:01:12.140> 3/8<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.290> an<00:01:13.410> inch<00:01:13.470> thick<00:01:13.860> so

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
they're about 3/8 of an inch thick so

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.130 
they're about 3/8 of an inch thick so
real<00:01:14.550> thick<00:01:14.820> flanges<00:01:15.240> on<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.540> intake<00:01:15.840> so<00:01:16.020> they

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
real thick flanges on the intake so they

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.750 
real thick flanges on the intake so they
don't<00:01:16.290> leak<00:01:17.450> and<00:01:18.740> real<00:01:19.740> thick<00:01:19.950> flanges<00:01:20.460> on<00:01:20.670> the

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:20.760 
don't leak and real thick flanges on the

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.250 
don't leak and real thick flanges on the
carburetor<00:01:21.210> so<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.510> doesn't<00:01:21.840> leak<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.110> can

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:22.260 
carburetor so it doesn't leak you can

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.840 
carburetor so it doesn't leak you can
see<00:01:22.380> how<00:01:22.440> thick<00:01:22.680> they're<00:01:25.400> so<00:01:26.400> I<00:01:26.460> thought<00:01:26.700> I'd

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
see how thick they're so I thought I'd

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.719 
see how thick they're so I thought I'd
do<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.000> little<00:01:27.240> short<00:01:27.630> video<00:01:27.780> here<00:01:28.490> this<00:01:29.490> also
