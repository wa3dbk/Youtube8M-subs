00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:01.969
 Hello. 

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:05.549
 I am Serizawa, an afterbeat music school guitar instructor. 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:12.100
 Today, I would like to do the arrangement of the 2 firmly in the practice section of the code cutting. 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:19.130
 If you are looking at this video, maybe you are looking at it from the very beginning, but the original 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:24.150
 This is the pattern of strokes called "Jar, Ja, Ja", "Tsukutuk", right hand pattern. 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.869
 I would like to change this a little. 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.869
 It is like this. 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.329
 The first "down, down up" pattern is 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:45.160
 It is a pattern where the second "down" of "down, n, up" is gone. 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.120
 "Ta, n, n, ta", "Tsuku-ku", "Ta, n, n, Ta", "Tsuku-ku", 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:55.780
 It feels like "Ta, N, N, Ta", "Tsukuku", "T, N, N, Ta", "Tsukuku". 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.100
 So, it is just going down, going up, going down and so on 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.370
 There is no need for empty picking. 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.149
 Such a feeling ... 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.830
 It is an ant to play at all, but 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.920
 This is by all means when empty picking can be done 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.540
 I want you to play a pattern that does not include empty picking. 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.600
 What does it mean that empty picking can be inserted? 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.409
 That is because the swing of the right hand spreads to the body, 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:28.130
 The rhythm keep gets better, the crispness gets better, and the good things are full. 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.350
 On the contrary, I can not pick empty 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.840
 I can not recommend you to always play a pattern that pulls out empty picks like this. 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.080
 Let's get to the basics and then go to applied things. 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:47.630
 It has been a bit confusing, but I will try it right away. 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.140
 It starts from "down" and "down, n, n". 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.920
 I will pick up, down and empty. 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.210
 "Ta, n, n, ta", "Tsuku-ku", "Ta, n, n, Ta", "Tsuku-ku", 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.799
 "Ta, n, n, ta", "Tsuku-ku", "Ta, n, n, Ta", "Tsuku-ku". 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:08.410
 So, here at the beginning it's very slow and good, 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.939
 Do it very slowly and let the right hand stain its movement. 

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:18.559
 The movement of the right hand is always constant and controls the rhythm depending on whether the pick is applied to the string or not. 

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:20.059
 Really, this is on. 

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:24.109
 "Ta, n, n, ta", "Tsukukuku", With the right hand fixed, 

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:31.019
 "Ta, n, n, ta", "Tsuku-ku", "Ta, n, n, Ta", "Tsuku-ku". 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:36.019
 Oh, I did not stop the sound. 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:40.090
 It is feeling. 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.609
 This phrase is ... 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:47.309
 This tempo. 

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:54.490
 If you can play smoothly even at this tempo 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:03:01.669
 I think that the flexibility or softness of the right hand is quite good. 

00:03:01.669 --> 00:03:06.569
 So I would like to introduce various arrangements in the future, 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:08.839
 For now, this video ends here once. 

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:10.719
 Please do your best to master.
