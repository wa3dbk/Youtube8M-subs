I'm<00:00:10.710> gonna<00:00:10.950> be<00:00:11.099> doing<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:11.580> star<00:00:11.969> challenge

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
I'm gonna be doing the star challenge

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.039 
I'm gonna be doing the star challenge
mission<00:00:12.780> which<00:00:12.900> is<00:00:13.019> get<00:00:13.290> away<00:00:13.469> again<00:00:14.839> this<00:00:15.839> is

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
mission which is get away again this is

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.720 
mission which is get away again this is
basically<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.740> get<00:00:16.890> away<00:00:17.070> mission<00:00:17.430> over

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
basically the get away mission over

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.429 
basically the get away mission over
again<00:00:18.000> although<00:00:18.420> now<00:00:18.600> we<00:00:18.660> have<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:18.960> damage

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
again although now we have a damage

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.710 
again although now we have a damage
counter<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.189> you<00:00:20.880> can't<00:00:21.090> just<00:00:21.359> cheat<00:00:21.570> the

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
counter and you can't just cheat the

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.509 
counter and you can't just cheat the
mission<00:00:22.080> by<00:00:22.260> blasting<00:00:23.010> through<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.220> walls

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
mission by blasting through the walls

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.800 
mission by blasting through the walls
very<00:00:23.820> early<00:00:24.359> on<00:00:25.820> if<00:00:26.820> you<00:00:27.000> do<00:00:27.210> that<00:00:27.480> you'll

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
very early on if you do that you'll

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.140 
very early on if you do that you'll
actually<00:00:28.019> end<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.619> challenge<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:29.939> it'll

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
actually end the challenge and it'll

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.150 
actually end the challenge and it'll
just<00:00:30.330> give<00:00:30.539> you<00:00:30.720> like<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.560> silent<00:00:32.009> treatment

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
just give you like the silent treatment

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.040 
just give you like the silent treatment
basically<00:00:35.030> so<00:00:36.030> we're<00:00:36.480> gonna<00:00:36.570> have<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.809> do<00:00:36.899> this

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
basically so we're gonna have to do this

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.229 
basically so we're gonna have to do this
the<00:00:37.230> right<00:00:37.350> way<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.860> while<00:00:38.520> also<00:00:38.790> freeing

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
the right way and while also freeing

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.830 
the right way and while also freeing
getting<00:00:39.690> more<00:00:40.110> than<00:00:40.260> 150<00:00:41.010> damage<00:00:41.190> or<00:00:41.879> keeping

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
getting more than 150 damage or keeping

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.529 
getting more than 150 damage or keeping
our<00:00:42.960> damage<00:00:43.290> under<00:00:43.559> on<00:00:43.710> 250<00:00:47.059> and<00:00:48.059> we<00:00:48.270> have<00:00:48.390> the

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
our damage under on 250 and we have the

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.430 
our damage under on 250 and we have the
path<00:00:48.750> key<00:00:49.020> on<00:00:49.260> so<00:00:49.739> that<00:00:49.950> gives<00:00:50.190> us<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:51.440> pretty

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
path key on so that gives us a pretty

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.689 
path key on so that gives us a pretty
good<00:00:52.559> warning<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.190> this<00:00:53.280> comes<00:00:53.520> on

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
good warning and this comes on

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.549 
good warning and this comes on
automatically<00:00:54.300> it's<00:00:54.899> not<00:00:55.110> something<00:00:55.440> you

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
automatically it's not something you

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.709 
automatically it's not something you
have<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.739> turn<00:00:56.010> on<00:00:57.199> and<00:00:59.000> the<00:01:00.000> asteroids<00:01:00.600> are

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
have to turn on and the asteroids are

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.579 
have to turn on and the asteroids are
pretty<00:01:00.960> hard<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.410> avoid<00:01:02.210> sometimes<00:01:03.260> but<00:01:04.260> for

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
pretty hard to avoid sometimes but for

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.160 
pretty hard to avoid sometimes but for
the<00:01:04.650> most<00:01:04.830> part<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.280> can<00:01:05.309> try<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:05.990> and<00:01:06.990> if<00:01:07.080> you

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
the most part you can try to and if you

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.750 
the most part you can try to and if you
get<00:01:07.320> skinned<00:01:07.650> by<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:07.799> few<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.220> them<00:01:08.369> don't<00:01:08.549> worry

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
get skinned by a few of them don't worry

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.600 
get skinned by a few of them don't worry
like<00:01:09.030> right<00:01:09.240> here<00:01:10.010> that's<00:01:11.010> pretty<00:01:11.280> much<00:01:11.400> just

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
like right here that's pretty much just

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.730 
like right here that's pretty much just
bound<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:12.000> happen<00:01:12.390> but<00:01:12.689> as<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.290> can<00:01:13.380> see<00:01:13.439> even

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
bound to happen but as you can see even

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.230 
bound to happen but as you can see even
though<00:01:13.920> we<00:01:14.040> hit<00:01:14.310> by<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:14.460> number<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.820> them<00:01:15.060> that's

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
though we hit by a number of them that's

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.060 
though we hit by a number of them that's
something<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.720> damaged<00:01:16.170> or<00:01:16.320> just<00:01:16.560> far<00:01:16.860> below

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
something a damaged or just far below

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.719 
something a damaged or just far below
the<00:01:17.490> 115<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.570> this<00:01:19.500> whole<00:01:19.680> process<00:01:19.860> lasts<00:01:20.670> a

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
the 115 and this whole process lasts a

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.300 
the 115 and this whole process lasts a
little<00:01:21.000> bit<00:01:21.119> over<00:01:21.420> two<00:01:21.659> minutes<00:01:22.009> so<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.130> kind

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
little bit over two minutes so it kind

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.330 
little bit over two minutes so it kind
of<00:01:23.340> gives<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.700> timer<00:01:24.979> so<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.040> know<00:01:26.189> how

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
of gives you a timer so you know how

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.520 
of gives you a timer so you know how
well<00:01:26.520> you're<00:01:26.700> doing<00:01:26.729> over<00:01:27.450> at<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.720> half<00:01:28.170> point

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
well you're doing over at the half point

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.600 
well you're doing over at the half point
just<00:01:29.070> when<00:01:29.640> those<00:01:29.790> stars<00:01:30.000> started<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.509> show<00:01:30.689> up

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
just when those stars started to show up

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.840 
just when those stars started to show up
but<00:01:32.610> it's<00:01:32.909> not<00:01:33.030> over<00:01:33.390> yet<00:01:34.009> make<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.040> few<00:01:35.640> quick

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
but it's not over yet make a few quick

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.399 
but it's not over yet make a few quick
turns

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
turns

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.980 
turns
and<00:01:38.330> this<00:01:40.490> mission<00:01:41.490> changes<00:01:42.090> up<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.390> slight<00:01:42.720> bit

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
and this mission changes up a slight bit

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.420 
and this mission changes up a slight bit
each<00:01:43.920> time<00:01:43.950> but<00:01:44.610> generally<00:01:45.299> it's<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.570> same

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
each time but generally it's the same

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.760 
each time but generally it's the same
including<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.700> way<00:01:47.850> that<00:01:48.150> the<00:01:48.470> path<00:01:49.470> around

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
including the way that the path around

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.420 
including the way that the path around
you<00:01:50.479> changes<00:01:51.479> that's<00:01:52.439> typically<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.189> same

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
you changes that's typically the same

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.779 
you changes that's typically the same
from<00:01:53.759> each<00:01:53.850> level<00:01:54.119> but<00:01:55.159> the<00:01:56.159> actual<00:01:56.610> position

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:56.789 
from each level but the actual position

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:59.149 
from each level but the actual position
of<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.420> stars<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.140> asteroids<00:01:58.649> that<00:01:58.740> come<00:01:58.979> at

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
of the stars and asteroids that come at

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.649 
of the stars and asteroids that come at
you<00:01:59.399> seems<00:01:59.970> to<00:02:00.149> kind<00:02:00.390> of<00:02:00.479> vary<00:02:00.930> a<00:02:01.020> little<00:02:01.200> bit

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
you seems to kind of vary a little bit

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:05.930 
you seems to kind of vary a little bit
but<00:02:03.659> other<00:02:03.930> than<00:02:04.110> that<00:02:04.200> just<00:02:04.520> make<00:02:05.520> sure<00:02:05.700> that

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
but other than that just make sure that

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.430 
but other than that just make sure that
you<00:02:06.060> put<00:02:06.420> some<00:02:06.630> distance<00:02:06.810> between<00:02:07.080> yourself

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
you put some distance between yourself

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.250 
you put some distance between yourself
and<00:02:07.860> oncoming<00:02:08.369> great<00:02:08.640> stars<00:02:10.580> you<00:02:11.580> can

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
and oncoming great stars you can

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.500 
and oncoming great stars you can
basically<00:02:13.310> let<00:02:14.310> them<00:02:14.459> pass<00:02:14.670> right<00:02:14.940> by<00:02:15.180> you<00:02:15.239> and

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
basically let them pass right by you and

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.320 
basically let them pass right by you and
your<00:02:15.660> gravity<00:02:15.840> well<00:02:16.140> if<00:02:16.319> they're<00:02:16.530> meant<00:02:16.860> to<00:02:16.920> be

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
your gravity well if they're meant to be

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.300 
your gravity well if they're meant to be
walls<00:02:18.330> next<00:02:18.600> to<00:02:18.780> you<00:02:18.900> as<00:02:19.680> you<00:02:19.830> can<00:02:19.950> see<00:02:20.130> that's

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
walls next to you as you can see that's

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.400
