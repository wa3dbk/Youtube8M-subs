super memory later and I had to have it

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.890 
super memory later and I had to have it
so<00:03:14.310> we<00:03:15.310> checked<00:03:15.640> out<00:03:15.820> some<00:03:15.970> references<00:03:16.540> and<00:03:16.810> a

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
so we checked out some references and a

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.140 
so we checked out some references and a
couple<00:03:17.799> of<00:03:18.010> them<00:03:18.130> were<00:03:18.280> some<00:03:18.640> sketches<00:03:18.970> that<00:03:19.000> I

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
couple of them were some sketches that I

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.590 
couple of them were some sketches that I
owe<00:03:19.239> from<00:03:19.930> DC<00:03:20.380> so<00:03:20.709> here<00:03:21.610> what<00:03:21.790> he<00:03:21.940> who<00:03:22.360> was<00:03:22.570> a

owe from DC so here what he who was a

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.300 
owe from DC so here what he who was a
little<00:03:23.019> bit<00:03:23.140> turned<00:03:23.380> down<00:03:23.620> compared<00:03:24.070> to<00:03:24.160> my

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
little bit turned down compared to my

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.880 
little bit turned down compared to my
museum<00:03:24.700> version<00:03:25.150> which<00:03:25.269> is<00:03:25.299> back<00:03:25.900> there<00:03:26.140> I'm

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
museum version which is back there I'm

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.920

and also his thigh area we sort of

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.039 
and also his thigh area we sort of
reduced<00:03:48.250> a<00:03:48.519> bit<00:03:49.030> of<00:03:49.269> the<00:03:49.330> muscle<00:03:49.660> turns<00:03:49.870> on

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
reduced a bit of the muscle turns on

fantastic er we redid the Cape as well
the<00:03:59.190> museum<00:04:00.190> version<00:04:00.670> back<00:04:00.849> there

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
the museum version back there

the museum version back there
is<00:04:01.870> a<00:04:01.930> is<00:04:02.770> flowing<00:04:03.370> that<00:04:03.520> way<00:04:03.670> and<00:04:03.819> it's<00:04:03.970> not<00:04:04.150> as

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
is a is flowing that way and it's not as

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.610 
is a is flowing that way and it's not as
as<00:04:05.910> reason<00:04:06.910> as<00:04:07.000> this<00:04:07.120> one<00:04:07.360> we<00:04:07.840> decided<00:04:08.200> to<00:04:08.380> give

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
as reason as this one we decided to give

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:15.780 
as reason as this one we decided to give
it<00:04:08.650> a<00:04:08.770> more<00:04:08.950> flowy<00:04:09.310> effect<00:04:10.530> and<00:04:14.430> yeah<00:04:15.430> pretty

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
it a more flowy effect and yeah pretty

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.900 
it a more flowy effect and yeah pretty
I'm<00:04:16.060> pretty<00:04:17.070> amazed<00:04:18.070> at<00:04:18.280> how<00:04:18.430> well<00:04:18.639> it<00:04:18.790> turned

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
I'm pretty amazed at how well it turned

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.950 
I'm pretty amazed at how well it turned
out<00:04:20.340> like<00:04:21.340> of<00:04:21.519> everything<00:04:21.910> else<00:04:22.090> I've<00:04:22.660> got<00:04:22.720> the

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
out like of everything else I've got the

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.680 
out like of everything else I've got the
button<00:04:23.200> here<00:04:23.380> that<00:04:23.820> switches<00:04:24.820> on<00:04:24.970> lock<00:04:25.180> LEDs

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
button here that switches on lock LEDs

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.570 
button here that switches on lock LEDs
at<00:04:25.840> the<00:04:25.930> bottom<00:04:26.230> and<00:04:26.410> I'll<00:04:26.770> explain<00:04:27.220> to<00:04:27.340> you

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
at the bottom and I'll explain to you

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.020 
at the bottom and I'll explain to you
guys<00:04:27.940> about<00:04:28.120> the<00:04:28.360> base<00:04:29.550> what<00:04:30.550> we've<00:04:30.669> done<00:04:30.820> was

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
guys about the base what we've done was

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:36.540 
guys about the base what we've done was
we<00:04:31.300> uh<00:04:32.310> we<00:04:33.310> created<00:04:33.639> this<00:04:33.700> symbol<00:04:34.150> and<00:04:35.430> had<00:04:36.430> it

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
we uh we created this symbol and had it

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.850 
we uh we created this symbol and had it
coming<00:04:37.240> out<00:04:37.419> like<00:04:37.630> in<00:04:37.810> the<00:04:37.900> sort<00:04:38.169> of<00:04:38.200> like<00:04:38.350> a<00:04:38.380> 3d

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
coming out like in the sort of like a 3d

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.920 
coming out like in the sort of like a 3d
version<00:04:39.040> and<00:04:39.400> we<00:04:39.490> installed<00:04:40.060> some<00:04:40.270> LEDs<00:04:40.750> on

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
version and we installed some LEDs on

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.560 
version and we installed some LEDs on
the<00:04:41.020> inside<00:04:41.380> there<00:04:41.760> but<00:04:42.760> what<00:04:42.910> we<00:04:43.030> had<00:04:43.240> to<00:04:43.360> do

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
the inside there but what we had to do

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:45.650 
the inside there but what we had to do
and<00:04:43.750> we<00:04:43.900> had<00:04:44.020> to<00:04:44.139> fill<00:04:44.380> up<00:04:44.500> with<00:04:44.590> key<00:04:44.860> resin

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
and we had to fill up with key resin

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.120 
and we had to fill up with key resin
only<00:04:46.660> said<00:04:46.840> it<00:04:46.960> sets<00:04:47.169> you<00:04:47.260> can<00:04:47.290> see<00:04:47.530> flush<00:04:47.860> with

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
only said it sets you can see flush with

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:49.350 
only said it sets you can see flush with
the<00:04:48.160> base<00:04:48.400> or<00:04:48.639> else<00:04:48.880> it<00:04:48.970> was<00:04:49.030> just<00:04:49.090> going<00:04:49.300> to

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
the base or else it was just going to

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.390 
the base or else it was just going to
wobble<00:04:49.570> around<00:04:49.750> everywhere<00:04:50.290> and<00:04:50.530> I<00:04:50.950> think<00:04:51.310> it

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
wobble around everywhere and I think it

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.510 
wobble around everywhere and I think it
was<00:04:51.490> a<00:04:51.520> cleanest<00:04:51.970> and<00:04:52.830> most<00:04:53.830> appropriate<00:04:54.490> way

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
was a cleanest and most appropriate way

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.680 
was a cleanest and most appropriate way
of<00:04:54.669> the<00:04:54.910> winner<00:04:55.530> um<00:04:56.530> I<00:04:57.430> will<00:04:58.240> be<00:04:58.330> getting<00:04:58.600> a<00:04:58.660> new

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690 
of the winner um I will be getting a new

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:02.460 
of the winner um I will be getting a new
base<00:05:00.000> that's<00:05:01.000> a<00:05:01.210> that's<00:05:01.690> been<00:05:01.930> airbrushed<00:05:02.229> she

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
base that's a that's been airbrushed she

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.200 
base that's a that's been airbrushed she
has<00:05:02.650> Hank<00:05:02.950> pant<00:05:03.250> painted<00:05:03.850> this<00:05:04.000> and

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210 
has Hank pant painted this and

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.060 
has Hank pant painted this and
understood<00:05:04.630> Raveena<00:05:04.900> liked<00:05:05.200> how<00:05:05.680> it<00:05:05.710> came<00:05:06.010> out

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.070 
understood Raveena liked how it came out

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:07.409 
understood Raveena liked how it came out
so<00:05:06.490> he's<00:05:06.610> going<00:05:06.729> to<00:05:06.789> airbrushing<00:05:07.150> new

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:07.419 
so he's going to airbrushing new

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:10.969 
so he's going to airbrushing new
baseball<00:05:07.840> me<00:05:07.960> just<00:05:08.169> ship<00:05:08.890> that<00:05:09.070> out<00:05:09.100> but

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:10.979 
baseball me just ship that out but

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:12.600 
baseball me just ship that out but
that's<00:05:11.979> the<00:05:12.070> whole<00:05:12.100> point<00:05:12.400> of<00:05:12.490> these
