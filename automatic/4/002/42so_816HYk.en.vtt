00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.040 
time trailing by training and that
basically<00:01:06.340> means<00:01:06.430> doing<00:01:07.240> loads<00:01:07.479> of<00:01:07.750> sweet

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.050

patiently<00:01:18.730> at<00:01:19.000> I<00:01:19.240> enjoy<00:01:19.570> something<00:01:20.080> that's

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:20.230 
patiently at I enjoy something that's

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.530 
patiently at I enjoy something that's
really<00:01:20.710> hard<00:01:20.890> to<00:01:21.130> get<00:01:21.310> right<00:01:21.550> even<00:01:22.360> for

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
really hard to get right even for

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.960 
really hard to get right even for
experienced<00:01:23.110> cyclists<00:01:23.710> those<00:01:24.310> of<00:01:24.460> us<00:01:24.580> we've

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
experienced cyclists those of us we've

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.550 
experienced cyclists those of us we've
been<00:01:25.090> lucky<00:01:25.330> enough<00:01:25.510> to<00:01:25.720> have<00:01:25.930> access<00:01:26.350> to<00:01:26.530> a

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
been lucky enough to have access to a

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.710 
been lucky enough to have access to a
power<00:01:26.830> meter<00:01:27.130> we've<00:01:27.250> often<00:01:27.430> found<00:01:27.940> we've

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
power meter we've often found we've

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.120 
power meter we've often found we've
actually<00:01:28.900> been<00:01:29.170> doing<00:01:29.230> in<00:01:29.500> time<00:01:29.710> trials

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
actually been doing in time trials

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.490 
actually been doing in time trials
starting<00:01:30.880> out<00:01:31.000> too<00:01:31.180> hard<00:01:31.420> and<00:01:31.870> gradually

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
starting out too hard and gradually

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.590 
starting out too hard and gradually
fading<00:01:33.010> throughout<00:01:33.340> we<00:01:33.880> do<00:01:34.030> it<00:01:34.150> that<00:01:34.270> way<00:01:34.330> it

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
fading throughout we do it that way it

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.180 
fading throughout we do it that way it
will<00:01:34.750> feel<00:01:35.050> very<00:01:35.230> hard<00:01:35.560> from<00:01:35.710> start<00:01:36.010> to<00:01:36.160> finish

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.190 
will feel very hard from start to finish

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.970 
will feel very hard from start to finish
but<00:01:36.700> actually<00:01:37.090> you<00:01:37.480> can<00:01:37.720> go<00:01:37.930> faster<00:01:38.560> by

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:38.980 
but actually you can go faster by

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.080 
but actually you can go faster by
pasting<00:01:39.310> things<00:01:39.610> better

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
pasting things better

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.090 
pasting things better
yeah<00:01:40.690> are<00:01:40.840> some<00:01:41.050> pros<00:01:41.290> I've<00:01:41.470> actually<00:01:41.590> started

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
yeah are some pros I've actually started

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.280 
yeah are some pros I've actually started
experimenting<00:01:42.670> with<00:01:42.940> a<00:01:43.090> negative<00:01:43.660> split

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
experimenting with a negative split

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.350 
experimenting with a negative split
strategy<00:01:44.950> which<00:01:45.100> is<00:01:45.220> basically<00:01:45.610> where<00:01:46.240> they

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
strategy which is basically where they

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.450 
strategy which is basically where they
go<00:01:46.570> at<00:01:46.900> a<00:01:47.020> higher<00:01:47.229> power<00:01:47.530> for<00:01:47.710> the<00:01:47.920> second<00:01:48.340> half

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
go at a higher power for the second half

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:49.920 
go at a higher power for the second half
of<00:01:48.610> the<00:01:48.700> event<00:01:48.880> compared<00:01:49.330> to<00:01:49.479> the<00:01:49.570> first<00:01:49.840> half

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
of the event compared to the first half

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.990 
of the event compared to the first half
and<00:01:50.530> it's<00:01:50.650> definitely<00:01:51.010> worth<00:01:51.310> experimenting

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
and it's definitely worth experimenting

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.420 
and it's definitely worth experimenting
with<00:01:52.510> for<00:01:52.720> you<00:01:52.780> too<00:01:53.080> so<00:01:53.710> maybe<00:01:53.950> have<00:01:54.160> a<00:01:54.190> play

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
with for you too so maybe have a play

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.850 
with for you too so maybe have a play
around<00:01:54.460> in<00:01:54.880> training<00:01:55.540> see<00:01:55.780> if<00:01:55.840> it<00:01:55.930> works<00:01:56.140> yeah

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
around in training see if it works yeah

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.230 
around in training see if it works yeah
if<00:01:57.010> you<00:01:57.130> haven't<00:01:57.310> got<00:01:57.520> a<00:01:57.550> power<00:01:57.790> meter<00:01:58.000> though

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
if you haven't got a power meter though

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.359 
if you haven't got a power meter though
then<00:01:58.420> think<00:01:58.690> of<00:01:58.750> it<00:01:58.869> like<00:01:59.050> this<00:01:59.380> if<00:02:00.010> your<00:02:00.160> time

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
then think of it like this if your time

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.490 
then think of it like this if your time
trial<00:02:00.640> is<00:02:00.820> over<00:02:00.970> 10<00:02:01.300> minutes<00:02:01.660> in<00:02:01.810> duration<00:02:01.990> the

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
trial is over 10 minutes in duration the

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.440 
trial is over 10 minutes in duration the
first<00:02:02.770> third<00:02:03.100> should<00:02:03.700> feel<00:02:03.880> reasonably

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
first third should feel reasonably

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.750 
first third should feel reasonably
comfortable<00:02:04.720> the<00:02:05.380> middle<00:02:05.710> part<00:02:05.979> just<00:02:06.520> starts

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 
comfortable the middle part just starts

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.160 
comfortable the middle part just starts
to<00:02:06.820> feel<00:02:06.850> like<00:02:07.060> you're<00:02:07.180> really<00:02:07.420> working<00:02:07.720> hard

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
to feel like you're really working hard

how<00:04:15.390> on<00:04:15.510> earth<00:04:15.600> is<00:04:15.810> stretching<00:04:16.410> and<00:04:16.530> improve

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:16.800 
how on earth is stretching and improve

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.520 
how on earth is stretching and improve
my<00:04:16.950> time<00:04:17.160> trailing<00:04:17.580> Dan<00:04:17.760> well<00:04:18.720> the<00:04:18.990> position

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
my time trailing Dan well the position

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:20.780 
my time trailing Dan well the position
that<00:04:19.620> your<00:04:19.770> Doc's<00:04:20.130> trying<00:04:20.400> to<00:04:20.460> get<00:04:20.550> really

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
that your Doc's trying to get really

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.580 
that your Doc's trying to get really
aerodynamic<00:04:21.090> on<00:04:21.570> a<00:04:21.600> time<00:04:21.870> trial<00:04:22.170> but<00:04:22.380> it's

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
aerodynamic on a time trial but it's

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.130 
aerodynamic on a time trial but it's
particularly<00:04:23.160> arduous<00:04:23.520> your<00:04:24.330> body<00:04:24.600> and<00:04:25.020> your

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
particularly arduous your body and your

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.020 
particularly arduous your body and your
muscles<00:04:25.290> especially<00:04:26.130> your<00:04:26.430> hamstrings

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
muscles especially your hamstrings

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.420 
muscles especially your hamstrings
glutes<00:04:27.420> and<00:04:27.660> lower<00:04:27.930> back<00:04:28.320> trying<00:04:29.100> to<00:04:29.190> get<00:04:29.280> over

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
glutes and lower back trying to get over

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.430 
glutes and lower back trying to get over
into<00:04:29.760> that<00:04:29.820> touched<00:04:30.150> position<00:04:30.720> yeah<00:04:31.200> so

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
into that touched position yeah so

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.470 
into that touched position yeah so
regular<00:04:31.800> stretching<00:04:32.040> could<00:04:32.700> help<00:04:32.910> you<00:04:33.060> adopt

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:33.480 
regular stretching could help you adopt

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.760 
regular stretching could help you adopt
your<00:04:33.660> current<00:04:33.990> position<00:04:34.380> much<00:04:34.560> more

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
your current position much more

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.920 
your current position much more
comfortably<00:04:35.160> or<00:04:35.520> it<00:04:36.120> can<00:04:36.270> also<00:04:36.300> help<00:04:36.630> you<00:04:36.810> get

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
comfortably or it can also help you get

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.840 
comfortably or it can also help you get
lower<00:04:37.230> and<00:04:37.530> therefore<00:04:37.860> more<00:04:38.160> aerodynamic<00:04:38.760> and

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
lower and therefore more aerodynamic and

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.200 
lower and therefore more aerodynamic and
faster<00:04:40.010> in<00:04:41.010> fact<00:04:41.280> if<00:04:41.460> you<00:04:41.580> want<00:04:41.730> to<00:04:41.820> see<00:04:42.000> a

faster in fact if you want to see a

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.000 
faster in fact if you want to see a

video give it a thumbs up just down
below<00:05:02.180> can<00:05:03.180> we<00:05:03.270> say<00:05:03.450> that<00:05:03.630> it'll<00:05:03.810> make<00:05:03.930> them

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
below can we say that it'll make them

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.950 
below can we say that it'll make them
faster<00:05:04.980> by<00:05:05.130> subscribing<00:05:05.630> well<00:05:06.630> the<00:05:06.810> thing

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
faster by subscribing well the thing

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.630 
faster by subscribing well the thing
that's<00:05:07.110> obvious<00:05:07.470> quickly<00:05:08.190> I<00:05:08.220> think<00:05:08.370> what

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:08.640 
that's obvious quickly I think what

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.300 
that's obvious quickly I think what
