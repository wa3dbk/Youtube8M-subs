and the game is really fun steering on
the<00:03:12.599> way<00:03:12.750> is<00:03:13.019> very<00:03:13.590> accurate<00:03:15.410> it's<00:03:16.410> not<00:03:16.650> the

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
the way is very accurate it's not the

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:20.990 
the way is very accurate it's not the
best<00:03:17.099> but<00:03:17.370> it's<00:03:17.519> still<00:03:17.670> very<00:03:17.730> accurate<00:03:18.450> I<00:03:20.000> do

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
best but it's still very accurate I do

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.410 
best but it's still very accurate I do
not<00:03:21.299> have<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:21.720> winner<00:03:21.959> Wilson<00:03:22.349> plus<00:03:22.650> I<00:03:23.150> do<00:03:24.150> not

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
not have the winner Wilson plus I do not

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.289 
not have the winner Wilson plus I do not
know<00:03:24.630> if<00:03:24.780> this<00:03:24.930> works<00:03:25.200> on<00:03:25.349> this<00:03:25.470> game<00:03:26.299> because

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
know if this works on this game because

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.059 
know if this works on this game because
this<00:03:27.450> game<00:03:27.630> came<00:03:27.989> before<00:03:28.230> that<00:03:28.470> we<00:03:28.709> motion

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
this game came before that we motion

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:32.720 
this game came before that we motion
plus<00:03:29.310> and<00:03:29.790> that<00:03:30.720> means<00:03:31.260> it<00:03:31.860> might<00:03:32.099> not<00:03:32.280> work<00:03:32.310> on

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
plus and that means it might not work on

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.960 
plus and that means it might not work on
the<00:03:32.819> Wii<00:03:32.940> MotionPlus

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.180 

gives<00:03:38.970> a<00:03:39.150> better<00:03:39.480> accuracy<00:03:39.959> like<00:03:40.860> better

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
gives a better accuracy like better

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.850 
gives a better accuracy like better
position<00:03:41.760> and<00:03:42.150> that<00:03:42.930> means<00:03:43.200> you'll<00:03:43.650> get

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
position and that means you'll get

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.890 
position and that means you'll get
better<00:03:44.010> steering<00:03:44.579> on<00:03:44.700> the<00:03:44.790> cars<00:03:45.060> or<00:03:45.480> better

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
better steering on the cars or better

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.210 
better steering on the cars or better
