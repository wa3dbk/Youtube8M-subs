00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
and what I like people people just use

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.630 
and what I like people people just use
it<00:00:26.400> for<00:00:26.430> you<00:00:26.789> know<00:00:26.930> having<00:00:27.930> having<00:00:28.859> their<00:00:29.189> you

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
it for you know having having their you

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.089 
it for you know having having their you
know<00:00:29.779> infinite<00:00:30.779> source<00:00:30.990> of<00:00:31.199> cobblestone<00:00:31.800> and

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
know infinite source of cobblestone and

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.040 
know infinite source of cobblestone and
you<00:00:32.790> know<00:00:32.880> that's<00:00:33.059> very<00:00:33.239> that's<00:00:33.420> nice<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:33.930> all

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
you know that's very that's nice and all

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.910 
you know that's very that's nice and all
but<00:00:34.320> I<00:00:34.739> don't<00:00:35.430> really<00:00:36.079> find<00:00:37.079> that<00:00:37.440> because<00:00:37.829> I

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
but I don't really find that because I

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.069 
but I don't really find that because I
can<00:00:38.070> just<00:00:38.190> go<00:00:38.340> mining<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:39.000> it'd<00:00:39.420> be<00:00:39.570> even<00:00:39.840> more

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
can just go mining and it'd be even more

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.450 
can just go mining and it'd be even more
useful<00:00:40.140> because<00:00:40.500> I<00:00:40.649> might<00:00:40.800> find<00:00:40.950> coal<00:00:41.250> or<00:00:41.430> iron

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
useful because I might find coal or iron

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.030 
useful because I might find coal or iron
while<00:00:42.000> I'm<00:00:42.210> just<00:00:42.570> regular<00:00:42.930> mining<00:00:43.260> instead<00:00:43.980> of

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
while I'm just regular mining instead of

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.549 
while I'm just regular mining instead of
doing<00:00:44.309> this<00:00:44.520> so<00:00:45.180> what<00:00:45.719> I<00:00:45.750> like<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.140> do<00:00:46.289> with<00:00:46.530> it

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
doing this so what I like to do with it

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.100 
doing this so what I like to do with it
is<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:47.730> like<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.030> build<00:00:48.329> something<00:00:48.600> like<00:00:49.579> this

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
is I like to build something like this

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.090 
is I like to build something like this
yes<00:00:52.110> this<00:00:52.949> is<00:00:53.219> just<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.699> huge<00:00:54.149> wall<00:00:55.100> just

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
yes this is just a huge wall just

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.740 
yes this is just a huge wall just
basically<00:00:56.760> it's<00:00:57.000> just<00:00:57.059> basically<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.510> huge

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
basically it's just basically a huge

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.990 
basically it's just basically a huge
wall<00:00:57.930> but<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.620> best<00:00:58.949> part<00:00:59.219> about<00:00:59.370> it<00:00:59.550> is<00:00:59.699> if<00:00:59.910> i

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
wall but the best part about it is if i

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.640 
wall but the best part about it is if i
take<00:01:00.149> this<00:01:00.329> tnt<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:01.020> thread<00:01:02.010> stone<00:01:02.280> torch<00:01:02.699> i

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650 
take this tnt and thread stone torch i

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:09.039 
take this tnt and thread stone torch i
can<00:01:04.650> just<00:01:05.540> plop<00:01:06.540> that<00:01:06.990> down<00:01:07.290> i<00:01:07.619> was<00:01:08.580> struggling

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:09.049 
can just plop that down i was struggling

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:15.110 
can just plop that down i was struggling
put<00:01:10.049> that<00:01:10.200> beside<00:01:10.530> it<00:01:12.170> give<00:01:13.170> it<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.290> second

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:15.120 
put that beside it give it a second

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.840 
put that beside it give it a second
and<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.200> see<00:01:16.380> that<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.950> just<00:01:17.250> reaches

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
and you see that it just reaches

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.160 
and you see that it just reaches
rebuilds<00:01:18.390> itself<00:01:20.240> no<00:01:21.240> matter<00:01:21.450> what<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:21.660> do<00:01:21.750> is

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
rebuilds itself no matter what I do is

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.580 
rebuilds itself no matter what I do is
just<00:01:22.350> rebuilt<00:01:22.800> itself<00:01:22.980> and<00:01:23.730> I<00:01:24.470> think<00:01:25.470> that'd

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
just rebuilt itself and I think that'd

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.230 
just rebuilt itself and I think that'd
be<00:01:25.710> really<00:01:25.920> good<00:01:26.190> for<00:01:26.430> if<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:26.670> wanted<00:01:26.940> to<00:01:27.030> make

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
be really good for if you wanted to make

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.880 
be really good for if you wanted to make
if<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:27.840> want<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.080> make<00:01:28.230> something<00:01:28.470> like<00:01:28.740> you

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
if you want to make something like you

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.830 
if you want to make something like you
know<00:01:28.920> like<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.220> castle<00:01:29.760> fortress<00:01:30.210> wall<00:01:30.480> and

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
know like a castle fortress wall and

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.320 
know like a castle fortress wall and
like<00:01:31.020> if<00:01:31.380> you're<00:01:31.560> shooting<00:01:31.770> TNT<00:01:32.400> edit<00:01:32.730> it'll

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
like if you're shooting TNT edit it'll

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.360 
like if you're shooting TNT edit it'll
just<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:33.720> know<00:01:33.900> rebuild<00:01:34.680> itself<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.190> another

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:35.370 
just you know rebuild itself and another

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.160 
just you know rebuild itself and another
thing<00:01:35.520> that's<00:01:35.700> good<00:01:35.850> about<00:01:35.880> that<00:01:36.210> is<00:01:36.360> if<00:01:36.510> if

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
thing that's good about that is if if

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.560 
thing that's good about that is if if
you<00:01:37.260> do<00:01:37.440> shoot<00:01:37.680> TNT<00:01:38.160> and<00:01:38.430> then<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:38.970> lands<00:01:39.360> and

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
you do shoot TNT and then it lands and

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.930 
you do shoot TNT and then it lands and
it<00:01:40.170> doesn't<00:01:40.710> blow<00:01:41.010> up<00:01:41.040> against<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.670> wall<00:01:41.820> and

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
it doesn't blow up against the wall and

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.040 
it doesn't blow up against the wall and
it<00:01:42.030> falls<00:01:42.180> down<00:01:42.270> in<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.540> water<00:01:42.660> it's<00:01:42.930> not

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:43.050 
it falls down in the water it's not

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.120 
it falls down in the water it's not
going<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.260> explode<00:01:43.530> because<00:01:43.710> you<00:01:43.860> know<00:01:43.980> it's

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
going to explode because you know it's

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.420 
going to explode because you know it's
TNT<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:44.610> water<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.060> I<00:01:45.930> I<00:01:46.710> did<00:01:47.130> this<00:01:47.220> with

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
TNT and water and I I did this with

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.490 
TNT and water and I I did this with
these<00:01:47.730> pistons<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.360> you<00:01:48.600> know<00:01:48.750> blocks--got

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
these pistons and you know blocks--got

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.610 
these pistons and you know blocks--got
88<00:01:50.100> on<00:01:50.460> blocks<00:01:50.850> up<00:01:51.090> or<00:01:51.900> it<00:01:52.050> can<00:01:52.140> only<00:01:52.230> go<00:01:52.440> eight

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:52.620 
88 on blocks up or it can only go eight

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.140 
88 on blocks up or it can only go eight
blocks<00:01:52.770> up<00:01:53.040> before<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.400> piston<00:01:53.700> is<00:01:53.790> just<00:01:53.940> stop

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
blocks up before the piston is just stop

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.840 
blocks up before the piston is just stop
pushing<00:01:54.510> and<00:01:54.750> i<00:01:54.810> believe<00:01:55.160> the<00:01:56.160> circuitry<00:01:56.730> is

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
pushing and i believe the circuitry is

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.640 
pushing and i believe the circuitry is
somewhere<00:01:57.240> around<00:01:57.360> here<00:01:57.600> yeah<00:01:57.990> here<00:01:58.290> it<00:01:58.350> is<00:01:58.410> it

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 
somewhere around here yeah here it is it

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.970 
somewhere around here yeah here it is it
just<00:01:59.400> this<00:02:00.150> just<00:02:00.480> pulses<00:02:00.990> impulses<00:02:01.740> so

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:01.980 
just this just pulses impulses so

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.730 
just this just pulses impulses so
whatever<00:02:02.670> one<00:02:02.970> block<00:02:03.210> is<00:02:03.360> missing<00:02:03.750> whenever

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
whatever one block is missing whenever

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.290 
whatever one block is missing whenever
one<00:02:04.920> block<00:02:05.130> is<00:02:05.280> missing<00:02:05.610> you<00:02:05.790> can<00:02:05.940> just<00:02:06.090> punch

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
one block is missing you can just punch

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.300 
one block is missing you can just punch
that<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:06.810> then<00:02:07.290> it'll<00:02:07.470> go<00:02:07.650> right<00:02:08.010> back<00:02:08.250> up

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
that and then it'll go right back up

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.760 
that and then it'll go right back up
because<00:02:08.730> the<00:02:09.260> cobblestone<00:02:10.260> will<00:02:10.410> generate

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
because the cobblestone will generate

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.380 
because the cobblestone will generate
and<00:02:11.040> then<00:02:11.130> it'll<00:02:11.280> push<00:02:11.490> it<00:02:11.640> up<00:02:11.760> and<00:02:12.150> then<00:02:12.240> it'll

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
and then it'll push it up and then it'll

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.030 
and then it'll push it up and then it'll
generate<00:02:12.570> again<00:02:13.020> then<00:02:13.320> it'll<00:02:13.530> just<00:02:13.680> be<00:02:13.830> ready

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
generate again then it'll just be ready

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.550 
generate again then it'll just be ready
to<00:02:14.250> push<00:02:14.580> it<00:02:14.700> up<00:02:14.760> again<00:02:15.030> I<00:02:15.240> mean<00:02:15.990> I<00:02:16.170> think<00:02:16.290> it's

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
to push it up again I mean I think it's

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.900 
to push it up again I mean I think it's
think<00:02:16.980> it's<00:02:17.100> something<00:02:17.340> you<00:02:17.430> could<00:02:17.550> use<00:02:17.700> it<00:02:17.730> a

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
think it's something you could use it a

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.960 
think it's something you could use it a
lot<00:02:18.030> of<00:02:18.180> adventure<00:02:18.600> maps<00:02:19.760> it's<00:02:20.760> just

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
lot of adventure maps it's just

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.120 
lot of adventure maps it's just
extremely<00:02:21.420> useful<00:02:21.810> it's<00:02:22.290> pretty<00:02:22.560> cool<00:02:22.770> too

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
extremely useful it's pretty cool too

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.690 
extremely useful it's pretty cool too
and<00:02:23.930> like<00:02:24.930> it<00:02:25.200> sits<00:02:25.800> in<00:02:25.920> like<00:02:26.130> a<00:02:26.160> new<00:02:26.430> way<00:02:26.640> to

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
and like it sits in like a new way to

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.670 
and like it sits in like a new way to
use<00:02:26.970> cobblestone<00:02:27.780> generator<00:02:27.810> to<00:02:28.350> other<00:02:28.470> than

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
use cobblestone generator to other than

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.620 
use cobblestone generator to other than
just<00:02:28.860> standing<00:02:29.250> there<00:02:29.280> and<00:02:29.550> you<00:02:29.610> know<00:02:29.760> mining

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
just standing there and you know mining

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.920 
just standing there and you know mining
cobblestone<00:02:31.230> for<00:02:31.560> a<00:02:31.590> really<00:02:32.430> long<00:02:32.459> time<00:02:32.930> so

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
cobblestone for a really long time so

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.010 
cobblestone for a really long time so
yeah<00:02:34.770> that<00:02:35.010> was<00:02:35.100> just<00:02:35.280> um<00:02:35.690> that<00:02:36.690> was<00:02:36.780> just<00:02:36.930> a
