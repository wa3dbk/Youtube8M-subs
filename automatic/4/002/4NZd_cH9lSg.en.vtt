dice<00:00:37.770> shut<00:00:38.070> off<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:39.000> took<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:39.840> little<00:00:40.020> longer

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
dice shut off and took a little longer

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.319 
dice shut off and took a little longer
to<00:00:40.290> make<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.469> skin<00:00:40.800> but<00:00:41.040> I<00:00:41.250> think<00:00:41.579> it's<00:00:41.879> good

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
to make the skin but I think it's good

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.900 
to make the skin but I think it's good
because<00:00:43.070> it's<00:00:44.070> well<00:00:44.309> worth<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.460> wait<00:00:44.550> because

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
because it's well worth the wait because

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.490 
because it's well worth the wait because
tons<00:00:45.480> of<00:00:45.570> people<00:00:45.660> wanted<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:45.989> set<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.140> shock<00:00:46.379> in

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
tons of people wanted to set a shock in

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.360 
tons of people wanted to set a shock in
the<00:00:46.590> actual<00:00:46.800> games<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.129> be<00:00:47.219> able<00:00:47.280> see

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
the actual games to be able see

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.319 
the actual games to be able see
character<00:00:47.730> which<00:00:47.820> would've<00:00:48.030> been<00:00:48.059> kind<00:00:48.210> of

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
character which would've been kind of

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.510 
character which would've been kind of
pointless<00:00:48.510> because<00:00:48.750> we<00:00:48.870> little<00:00:49.800> bit<00:00:49.890> cuz<00:00:50.460> we

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
pointless because we little bit cuz we

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.180 
pointless because we little bit cuz we
already<00:00:50.730> extras<00:00:51.000> in<00:00:51.149> Black<00:00:51.449> Adam<00:00:52.100> but<00:00:53.100> the

already extras in Black Adam but the

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.010 
already extras in Black Adam but the

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
because it's gonna be impossible to get

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.430 
because it's gonna be impossible to get
the<00:00:57.090> rheostat<00:00:57.329> chakra<00:00:57.930> from<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.109> TV<00:00:58.289> show
