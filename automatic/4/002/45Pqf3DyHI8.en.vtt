we have our thermostat set at 568 each
decks<00:00:23.180> are<00:00:23.860> relatively<00:00:24.860> different<00:00:25.070> in

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
decks are relatively different in

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:26.530 
decks are relatively different in
temperature<00:00:25.700> this<00:00:25.820> is<00:00:25.880> the<00:00:26.060> top<00:00:26.270> deck<00:00:26.509> and

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:26.540 
temperature this is the top deck and

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.200 
temperature this is the top deck and
you'll<00:00:26.840> see<00:00:26.990> it<00:00:27.110> was<00:00:27.230> 570<00:00:27.980> the<00:00:28.910> two<00:00:29.060> middle

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
you'll see it was 570 the two middle

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.830 
you'll see it was 570 the two middle
decks<00:00:29.480> are<00:00:29.740> not<00:00:30.740> as<00:00:31.009> high<00:00:31.970> in<00:00:32.000> temperature<00:00:32.599> but

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840 
decks are not as high in temperature but

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.450 
decks are not as high in temperature but
they're<00:00:33.050> right<00:00:33.530> about<00:00:33.739> what<00:00:33.890> we<00:00:33.980> wanted<00:00:34.280> Matt

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
they're right about what we wanted Matt

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.020 
they're right about what we wanted Matt
555<00:00:35.180> 554<00:00:36.140> and<00:00:36.410> then<00:00:37.070> the<00:00:37.220> bottom<00:00:37.579> deck<00:00:37.790> is

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
555 554 and then the bottom deck is

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.760 
555 554 and then the bottom deck is
going<00:00:38.360> to<00:00:38.450> be<00:00:38.630> the<00:00:38.989> hottest<00:00:39.200> deck<00:00:39.530> that's

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:39.770 
going to be the hottest deck that's

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:40.900 
going to be the hottest deck that's
right<00:00:39.950> where<00:00:40.100> your<00:00:40.220> flame<00:00:40.430> is<00:00:40.460> and<00:00:40.820> that's

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
right where your flame is and that's

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.660 
right where your flame is and that's
approximately<00:00:41.810> about<00:00:41.870> 590<00:00:42.650> a<00:00:42.770> lot<00:00:43.370> of<00:00:43.460> people

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
approximately about 590 a lot of people

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.100 
approximately about 590 a lot of people
say<00:00:43.760> you<00:00:43.820> can't<00:00:44.120> use<00:00:44.300> the<00:00:44.450> bottom<00:00:44.750> deck<00:00:44.900> but

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
say you can't use the bottom deck but

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.040 
say you can't use the bottom deck but
I'm<00:00:45.170> going<00:00:45.290> to<00:00:45.320> show<00:00:45.470> you<00:00:45.500> that<00:00:45.680> you<00:00:45.770> can<00:00:47.050> in

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
I'm going to show you that you can in

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.560 
I'm going to show you that you can in
the<00:00:48.740> center<00:00:48.980> post<00:00:49.220> the<00:00:49.730> more<00:00:49.910> your<00:00:50.060> holes<00:00:50.360> are

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
the center post the more your holes are

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.990 
the center post the more your holes are
closed<00:00:50.930> the<00:00:51.380> hotter<00:00:51.590> it<00:00:51.710> will<00:00:51.860> be<00:00:52.040> you'll<00:00:52.790> see

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
closed the hotter it will be you'll see

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.640 
closed the hotter it will be you'll see
I<00:00:53.030> have<00:00:53.330> mine<00:00:53.540> adjusted<00:00:54.080> on<00:00:54.230> some<00:00:54.470> of<00:00:54.560> the

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:54.650 
I have mine adjusted on some of the

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.500 
I have mine adjusted on some of the
older<00:00:54.920> models<00:00:55.310> you<00:00:55.460> have<00:00:55.670> to<00:00:55.850> adjust<00:00:55.970> them<00:00:56.360> the

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
older models you have to adjust them the

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.330 
older models you have to adjust them the
newer<00:00:56.660> model<00:00:57.050> of<00:00:57.140> the<00:00:57.260> roto<00:00:57.470> flexes<00:00:57.920> you<00:00:58.070> don't

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
newer model of the roto flexes you don't

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.670 
newer model of the roto flexes you don't
they<00:00:58.880> should<00:00:59.150> be<00:00:59.330> the<00:00:59.900> same<00:01:00.110> temperature<00:01:00.470> on

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
they should be the same temperature on

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.460 
they should be the same temperature on
all<00:01:00.860> decks<00:01:01.160> so<00:01:01.720> really<00:01:02.720> it<00:01:02.810> depends<00:01:03.080> on<00:01:03.230> what

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
all decks so really it depends on what

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.890 
all decks so really it depends on what
model<00:01:03.710> you<00:01:03.950> have<00:01:04.189> this<00:01:04.610> is<00:01:04.759> a<00:01:04.790> 56<00:01:05.449> model<00:01:05.780> that

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
model you have this is a 56 model that

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.679 
model you have this is a 56 model that
I'm<00:01:06.020> working<00:01:06.200> with<00:01:06.409> at<00:01:07.159> Paisano's<00:01:07.850> you'll<00:01:08.509> see

00:01:08.679 --> 00:01:08.689 
I'm working with at Paisano's you'll see

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:10.149 
I'm working with at Paisano's you'll see
it's<00:01:08.840> not<00:01:08.960> completely<00:01:09.380> full<00:01:09.770> but<00:01:09.799> it's

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
it's not completely full but it's

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:11.410 
it's not completely full but it's
getting<00:01:10.460> there<00:01:10.640> and<00:01:10.880> what's<00:01:11.210> really

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
getting there and what's really

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.850 
getting there and what's really
important<00:01:12.020> is<00:01:12.140> you<00:01:12.320> want<00:01:12.530> to<00:01:12.619> have<00:01:12.740> your

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
that's cutting very very fast

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.109

what's nice about a roto flexes as they

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:57.760 
what's nice about a roto flexes as they
make<00:01:56.330> them<00:01:56.479> on<00:01:56.600> one<00:01:56.810> line<00:01:57.049> they<00:01:57.260> actually<00:01:57.560> put

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
make them on one line they actually put

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.500 
make them on one line they actually put
them<00:01:57.890> in<00:01:57.979> on<00:01:58.100> the<00:01:58.130> other<00:01:58.340> door<00:01:58.670> and<00:01:58.909> then<00:01:59.420> I

00:01:59.500 --> 00:01:59.510 
them in on the other door and then I

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:01.480 
them in on the other door and then I
actually<00:01:59.690> worked<00:02:00.049> the<00:02:00.140> other<00:02:00.320> door<00:02:00.650> to<00:02:01.040> take

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
actually worked the other door to take

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.490 
actually worked the other door to take
them<00:02:01.610> out<00:02:01.790> so<00:02:02.119> you<00:02:02.420> have<00:02:02.540> two<00:02:02.720> doors<00:02:02.930> one<00:02:03.080> door

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
them out so you have two doors one door

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.160 
them out so you have two doors one door
in<00:02:03.710> one<00:02:03.950> door<00:02:04.130> out<00:02:04.190> I<00:02:04.610> like<00:02:05.450> that<00:02:05.659> and<00:02:05.930> prefer

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.899 
in one door out I like that and prefer
that<00:02:06.350> much<00:02:06.530> better<00:02:06.740> than<00:02:07.040> having<00:02:07.189> like<00:02:07.549> four

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
that much better than having like four

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.029 
that much better than having like four
decks<00:02:08.269> where<00:02:08.569> you<00:02:08.629> have<00:02:08.780> four<00:02:09.110> doors<00:02:09.349> in<00:02:09.649> four
