00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.480
 hello everyone guys are quick street 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.640
 de welcome to my new video today 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.590
 We're here to make a new video tag 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.960
 as you read from the title below 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.390
 I'm here to respond to the video tag 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.790
 fifteen bedroom books in 2005 he has 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.250
 launched the miss tortellino qua note 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:33.530
 below you find the equals side to me 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.000
 here beside me depends on which side 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.520
 of a group has re cards for that 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.010
 I still have to understand his video in 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.340
 which presents this we say viral video 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.949
 I have been saying undecided until 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.410
 now if you actually do this 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:51.019
 video for a simple reason we are a 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.809
 May and therefore not that he had had 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:56.090
 much sense to make a video about 15 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.100
 books I intend to read in 2000 e 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.620
 civil 15 when we are by now 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.120
 almost half-year, however, say that there is 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.170
 in short, since I imposed myself a 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.700
 goal of forty books for 2015 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.380
 actually 15 books I could also 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.420
 choose to read in the midst of everyone 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.220
 those that have already imposed me or that 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.170
 however I would like to read the arc 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.750
 of the night to say that I am always 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.700
 that splendid different because I also have 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.280
 asked is led that I could even if curly 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.410
 pizza place so let alone 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.290
 I decided to insert inside 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.600
 this list is ten books and 5 graphic 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.510
 novel so it won't be only fifteen 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.580
 books but it will be a mixture of comic books 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:37.280
 etc. etc. as you know I read 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.500
 both of them, but all we need to do is lose chat 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.830
 we leave immediately and leave precisely with i 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.480
 ten books two books that surely 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.670
 light indeed actually started area 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.140
 I just have to finish in the 2015 arc 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.220
 however, two books that sent me 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.100
 the publishing houses 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.990
 the first one is the murdoch tv board that i 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.600
 sent the eo I have yet to finish 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.540
 to read are still early though 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.700
 I was particularly enjoying it while 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.140
 the other is maybe the red queen 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.000
 Dragon who sent me the hare 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.560
 issues that I still have to start but that 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.019
 I was almost trying to read during 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.420
 summer because it is a beautiful brick 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:14.310
 so it takes me longer and more 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.500
 summer is always much more inclined 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.900
 books a little bigger than other books 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.849
 that I'm sure I'll read why she does 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.150
 part of my personal project that can 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:26.640
 obviously you will discover in the future is the 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.260
 black ibu evening rain on yellow in 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.569
 plan to read this this year 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.880
 book just because I have a project in 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.190
 mind my personal project and therefore 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.140
 surely you will hear a lot about it 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.540
 soon on the canal that is very soon yes 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.840
 talk about august use talk titina like 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.000
 committee is not a year unless I read at least 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.580
 a book by kyle barker and if the year 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.250
 last I read some stuff anyway 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.230
 this year I want to get back in my hands 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.420
 the author continuing with the reading of 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.430
 blood books in fact I'll read shroud 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.380
 which is the third in chronological order of the 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.110
 blood books book I purchased 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.540
 recently but I already know that anyway at least 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.549
 with the martino rivers we will read together 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:09.360
 then I also believe the now we see is 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:12.120
 liar love I am very curious and of 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.700
 read it not heard so many opinions 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.140
 positive someone even negative though 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.819
 here I am almost able to read this book 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.790
 book I bought last year 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:22.920
 salon of the book of turin and that we have 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:26.760
 agreed that we will read together el e 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.590
 is jeffrey gene this's former meters will be the 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.750
 first book I will read about this author 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.519
 and I am very very curious too 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.350
 a nice brick, but here it is 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.780
 however, he has heard many opinions 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.700
 positive and I can't wait to read it myself 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.709
 I'm a little ashamed to show you this book 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.510
 because I still haven't read it but not 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.350
 I'm not the only one in my opinion on the 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.410
 face of the earth 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.850
 after the year of 1984 of george orwell that 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.500
 I had already forced myself to read the year 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.989
 last then last year in the end not 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.239
 the more I read but this year it will not jump 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.430
 indeed they will be the next readings there 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:58.889
 I swear while the cat complains how 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:02.489
 you know I have some problems with murakami 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:05.040
 arkin and I had already decided when 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:07.319
 in short , I had already shown the colorless 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.650
 his merry ass as much in cutro ass 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:12.000
 that this year I would have tried to trim 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.470
 some book of murakami and di 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.160
 read it and I decided to leave 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:20.560
 to start with norvegian wood then 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.620
 we will see and from this I will understand if 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.690
 actually murakami is for me or not 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.970
 then maybe after this I could read 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.950
 also certainly taking care of it because I have it here 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.770
 perhaps south of the west border of the sun 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.400
 but in the meantime this then we will see the da 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.170
 get 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.660
 the last book I am going to show you is 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:40.270
 another of hashimoto nursery you can say 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.040
 dolphin bed center and these then me 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.900
 I will also try to read the second book 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.880
 of the series the kingdom that is the pain 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.800
 shadows the magic because of what I have 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.240
 understood however this year should 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.910
 get out also the last two remaining ones 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:55.110
 it would also be now because in short this 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:57.220
 here it came out around October in short 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.680
 they were the quickest to get out 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.870
 first two then to release the third 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.790
 after the second, however, this is it 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.710
 I'll read just to be ready for 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:07.570
 immediately have the third one to read then 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.890
 as always as all see yoshimoto the 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:12.100
 small child is written in characters 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:14.260
 cubitali so the first one is curious 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:16.419
 it didn't make me mad, but it was me 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.550
 liked later we will see this now instead 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:20.140
 I would move on to the comics part that 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.390
 I said I'm in total five 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:24.130
 lines to reach the total of 15 

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:26.050
 titles and let's go 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:28.480
 the first is an appeal from an author 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:30.460
 Japanese that I like to die for I have it 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:32.919
 beloved I'll confirm me I'm talking about seas 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:35.169
 yamazaki is definitely going to read his 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:37.570
 pil title that I have in the library 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:39.940
 actually for some time maybe 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:42.010
 three years I'm talking about fairy tales of 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:44.650
 French victory also came 

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:47.070
 time to read as you know the only one 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:48.720
 sheet the casket that absolutely 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:51.250
 wonderful and I see absolutely nothing 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.410
 time to read the other work that 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:55.690
 still recovered is my recent one 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:58.300
 life drawn evil dgp last year i have 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:00.340
 read a story I now want to read 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.900
 also this then succeed also in 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:03.310
 recover something else 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.860
 so many areas my life badly drawn 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:08.229
 which I am really very very curious is 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:10.390
 therefore the last ones arrived at this turn 

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:12.430
 two sails show together because they are two 

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:15.190
 works we say of the same author the 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:16.200
 first is the graphic novel by kohara line by 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:20.190
 miguel 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:22.140
 but with the designs of craig ross then 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:23.310
 this picture also recovered 

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:25.560
 last year he takes on the book of turin 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:27.750
 and I'm very curious to read it said 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.280
 I practically read everything 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:31.890
 what there is to read given everything 

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.960
 what he knows how to see perhaps by line 

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:34.830
 so that you know our files 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.840
 like to die 

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:38.970
 I talked about it here on the channel maybe there 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:41.490
 I leave the video here on the cards then 

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:42.900
 light this is the last note that you 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:45.540
 in the meantime I will try to read the first one 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:49.410
 volume then by now should come out are 

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:51.690
 succeeded even second of sandman I have it 

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:55.250
 recovered late last year 

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:58.020
 but let's say it's a little something 

00:06:55.250 --> 00:07:00.390
 demanding and therefore it takes 

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:02.760
 right mindset and then I'll get there 

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:06.750
 maybe this summer very calmly a 

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:10.980
 read it to me within this 

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:12.660
 dream world that everyone loves less all 

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:13.800
 those who have elected by hand and that I 

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:15.780
 I absolutely don't see them 

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:18.090
 face then read that first one 

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:20.250
 of blood ok guys these were i 

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:22.290
 fifteen titles that I will definitely read 

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:24.210
 in 2015 in Milan from now 

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:26.310

 I recommend this video, let me 

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:31.290
 below, maybe I missed it 

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:33.060
 because I saw what they did in a 

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:34.470
 a lot of people but you are somebody 

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:36.390
