to<00:00:25.650> make<00:00:25.910> example<00:00:26.910> if<00:00:26.970> you<00:00:27.119> look<00:00:27.269> here<00:00:27.599> you'll

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
to make example if you look here you'll

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.179 
to make example if you look here you'll
see<00:00:27.990> that<00:00:28.170> you<00:00:29.929> know<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.859> water<00:00:32.070> is

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
see that you know the the water is

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.410 
see that you know the the water is
reflective<00:00:32.759> but<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.300> soil<00:00:34.290> isn't<00:00:35.390> now<00:00:36.390> a

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
reflective but the soil isn't now a

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.760 
reflective but the soil isn't now a
whole<00:00:36.540> bunch<00:00:36.780> of<00:00:36.870> little<00:00:37.050> things<00:00:37.170> how<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.559> get

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
whole bunch of little things how to get

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:38.900 
whole bunch of little things how to get
you<00:00:37.860> know<00:00:37.950> it's<00:00:38.100> nice<00:00:38.219> little<00:00:38.489> ball<00:00:38.700> on<00:00:38.820> the

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
you know it's nice little ball on the

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.610 
you know it's nice little ball on the
outside<00:00:39.329> so<00:00:39.570> it's<00:00:39.690> not<00:00:39.750> just<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:40.050> regular<00:00:40.200> color

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
outside so it's not just a regular color

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.770 
outside so it's not just a regular color
just<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.670> whole<00:00:41.790> bunch<00:00:41.940> of<00:00:42.149> little<00:00:42.420> you<00:00:42.660> know

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.000 
features and how to apply materials I'll
show<00:00:45.899> you<00:00:45.960> where<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.350> get<00:00:46.469> them<00:00:46.620> up<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.860> net

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
show you where to get them up the net

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.569 
show you where to get them up the net
you<00:00:47.309> know<00:00:47.340> there's<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.730> bunch<00:00:47.910> of<00:00:48.120> are<00:00:48.870> they<00:00:49.579> CG

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
you know there's a bunch of are they CG

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.520 
you know there's a bunch of are they CG
to<00:00:51.320> them<00:00:52.320> yeah<00:00:52.500> tree<00:00:52.860> facial<00:00:53.430> detection<00:00:54.530> you

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
to them yeah tree facial detection you

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.950 
to them yeah tree facial detection you
know<00:00:55.620> you'll<00:00:55.800> see<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:56.010> textures<00:00:56.750> how<00:00:57.750> they're

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
know you'll see the textures how they're

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:58.459 
know you'll see the textures how they're
used

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
used

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.650 
used
you<00:00:59.070> know<00:00:59.190> how<00:00:59.579> they<00:00:59.730> come<00:00:59.940> in<00:01:00.210> what<00:01:00.390> format

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
you know how they come in what format

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.270 
you know how they come in what format
they<00:01:00.870> come<00:01:01.079> how<00:01:01.559> they<00:01:01.739> look<00:01:01.890> when<00:01:02.010> you<00:01:02.129> get

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
they come how they look when you get

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.369 
they come how they look when you get
them<00:01:02.539> what<00:01:03.539> we're<00:01:03.660> gonna<00:01:03.780> do<00:01:03.989> with<00:01:04.110> them<00:01:04.229> for

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
them what we're gonna do with them for

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.910 
them what we're gonna do with them for
example<00:01:04.439> here<00:01:04.949> you<00:01:05.040> see<00:01:05.100> I<00:01:05.900> use<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.080> layer<00:01:07.290> so

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
example here you see I use the layer so

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.920 
example here you see I use the layer so
there's<00:01:08.100> textures<00:01:08.520> inside<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.210> it's

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
there's textures inside it and it's

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.429 
there's textures inside it and it's
multiplied<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:11.070> know<00:01:11.220> it's<00:01:12.260> mixed<00:01:13.260> with

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
multiplied and you know it's mixed with

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.560 
multiplied and you know it's mixed with
other<00:01:14.280> effects<00:01:14.790> I'm<00:01:14.939> here<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.180> mix<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.479> the

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
other effects I'm here a mix of the

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.420 
other effects I'm here a mix of the
fernell<00:01:15.900> effect<00:01:16.290> in<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.560> reflection<00:01:17.070> channel

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
fernell effect in a reflection channel

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.490 
fernell effect in a reflection channel
so<00:01:17.670> it's<00:01:18.540> you<00:01:18.750> know<00:01:18.840> it's<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:19.080> bunch<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.380> little

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
so it's you know it's a bunch of little

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.730 
so it's you know it's a bunch of little
things<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:20.180> I'll<00:01:21.180> show<00:01:21.330> you<00:01:21.420> how<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.540> do<00:01:21.780> I'll

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
things that I'll show you how to do I'll

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:23.780 
things that I'll show you how to do I'll
show<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:22.950> how<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.100> write<00:01:23.220> ambient<00:01:23.640> occlusion

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
show you how to write ambient occlusion

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.969 
show you how to write ambient occlusion
to<00:01:24.119> differ<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:24.930> know<00:01:25.020> example<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.890> the

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
to differ to you know example to the

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.969 
to differ to you know example to the
words<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.930> you<00:01:27.930> know<00:01:28.049> this<00:01:28.229> so<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:28.829> don't

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
words and you know this so you don't

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.050 
words and you know this so you don't
have<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.159> apply<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.549> whole<00:01:29.670> scene<00:01:29.909> you

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
have to apply to the whole scene you

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.280 
have to apply to the whole scene you
apply<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.659> pass<00:01:30.840> where<00:01:31.079> it's<00:01:31.170> actually

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
apply to the pass where it's actually

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.810 
apply to the pass where it's actually
visible<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:32.490> know<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.780> decrease<00:01:33.780> render<00:01:34.110> time

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
visible you know to decrease render time

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.670 
visible you know to decrease render time
I'll<00:01:35.820> show<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.060> a<00:01:36.119> key<00:01:36.509> frames<00:01:36.840> how<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.259> you

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
I'll show you a key frames how to you
