going to be foot left right foot left
right<00:00:51.270> okay<00:00:52.170> so<00:00:54.050> try<00:00:55.050> that<00:00:55.230> again

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
right okay so try that again

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.439 
right okay so try that again
alright<00:00:57.930> now<00:00:58.320> add<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.920> downbeat<00:00:59.550> on<00:00:59.730> your<00:01:00.180> right

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
this try it again now what you want to

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.160 
this try it again now what you want to
do<00:01:13.250> is<00:01:14.250> add<00:01:14.490> one<00:01:14.700> more<00:01:14.909> hi-hat<00:01:15.420> hit<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:15.869> one

more kick drum at the end of that so

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.710 
more kick drum at the end of that so
it's<00:01:19.049> going<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.229> go<00:01:19.439> like<00:01:19.619> this<00:01:19.860> super<00:01:20.400> slow

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720

now is on beat three this is the first
is<00:01:42.260> a<00:01:42.290> 2<00:01:42.590> bar<00:01:42.800> measure<00:01:43.130> loop<00:01:43.460> to<00:01:44.060> measure<00:01:44.270> loop

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800 
is a 2 bar measure loop to measure loop

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.630 
is a 2 bar measure loop to measure loop
what<00:01:45.800> we're<00:01:45.890> going<00:01:46.010> to<00:01:46.040> add<00:01:46.190> now<00:01:46.400> is<00:01:46.430> a

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
what we're going to add now is a

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.270 
what we're going to add now is a
downbeat<00:01:47.240> on<00:01:47.420> the<00:01:47.630> tom<00:01:48.430> on<00:01:49.430> three<00:01:50.390> okay<00:01:51.020> so

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
downbeat on the tom on three okay so

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.880 
downbeat on the tom on three okay so
this<00:01:52.280> is<00:01:52.400> the<00:01:52.490> part<00:01:52.700> we've<00:01:52.790> got<00:01:52.970> so<00:01:53.180> far<00:01:56.890> now

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
this is the part we've got so far now

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.170 
this is the part we've got so far now
that<00:01:57.920> second<00:01:58.460> kick<00:01:58.640> right<00:01:58.850> there<00:01:59.000> we're<00:01:59.090> going

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
that second kick right there we're going

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:05.710 
that second kick right there we're going
to<00:01:59.270> add<00:01:59.390> a<00:01:59.420> Tom<00:01:59.690> to<00:01:59.930> it<00:02:03.670> now<00:02:04.670> on<00:02:04.850> the<00:02:05.210> four<00:02:05.510> E

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
to add a Tom to it now on the four E

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.290 
to add a Tom to it now on the four E
Anna<00:02:06.250> it's<00:02:07.250> basically<00:02:07.760> going<00:02:07.940> to<00:02:08.000> be<00:02:08.119> right

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
Anna it's basically going to be right

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.140 
Anna it's basically going to be right
left<00:02:08.540> right<00:02:08.600> left<00:02:09.880> but<00:02:10.880> we're<00:02:11.000> going<00:02:11.090> to

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
left right left but we're going to

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.670 
left right left but we're going to
double<00:02:11.570> that<00:02:11.660> first<00:02:11.959> right<00:02:12.230> so<00:02:12.410> it's<00:02:12.530> going<00:02:12.620> to

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
double that first right so it's going to

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:23.080 
double that first right so it's going to
go<00:02:13.990> so<00:02:20.709> first<00:02:21.709> part<00:02:22.010> of<00:02:22.160> the<00:02:22.310> next<00:02:22.520> measure<00:02:22.820> is

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
go so first part of the next measure is

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.880 
go so first part of the next measure is
the<00:02:23.270> same<00:02:23.750> thing<00:02:24.020> as<00:02:24.140> the<00:02:24.260> first<00:02:24.410> part<00:02:24.740> of<00:02:24.830> that

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
the same thing as the first part of that

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.949 
the same thing as the first part of that
measure<00:02:25.370> until<00:02:26.060> it<00:02:26.209> gets<00:02:26.360> to<00:02:26.480> beat<00:02:26.660> three

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
measure until it gets to beat three

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.440 
measure until it gets to beat three
being<00:02:27.860> we<00:02:27.980> do<00:02:28.100> different<00:02:28.550> is<00:02:28.640> we<00:02:29.090> leave<00:02:29.300> the

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
being we do different is we leave the

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.290 
being we do different is we leave the
Tom<00:02:29.690> off<00:02:29.990> of<00:02:30.440> beat<00:02:30.650> three<00:02:31.010> and<00:02:31.190> we<00:02:31.880> put<00:02:32.090> both

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
Tom off of beat three and we put both

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.870 
Tom off of beat three and we put both
Tom's<00:02:32.630> on<00:02:32.870> beat<00:02:33.080> four<00:02:33.530> so<00:02:34.370> it's<00:02:34.520> going<00:02:34.640> to<00:02:34.700> go

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
Tom's on beat four so it's going to go

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:42.100 
Tom's on beat four so it's going to go
like<00:02:35.090> this<00:02:40.060> then<00:02:41.060> we<00:02:41.180> add<00:02:41.330> a<00:02:41.360> role<00:02:41.750> on<00:02:42.050> the

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
like this then we add a role on the

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.920 
like this then we add a role on the
snare<00:02:42.590> so<00:02:42.980> all<00:02:43.280> together<00:02:43.459> this<00:02:44.180> is<00:02:44.239> our<00:02:44.570> that

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
snare so all together this is our that

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.180 
snare so all together this is our that
measure<00:02:45.170> let's<00:02:45.380> do<00:02:45.500> that<00:02:45.650> measure<00:02:45.830> first<00:02:46.010> then

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
measure let's do that measure first then

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.740 
measure let's do that measure first then
we'll<00:02:46.310> do<00:02:46.400> it<00:02:46.430> all<00:02:46.610> together<00:02:46.730> so

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.390 

so<00:02:52.380> we're<00:02:52.500> going<00:02:52.590> to<00:02:52.650> add<00:02:52.800> a<00:02:52.830> roll<00:02:53.130> at<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:53.310> end

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
so we're going to add a roll at the end

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:54.920 
so we're going to add a roll at the end
of<00:02:53.610> that<00:02:53.730> measure<00:02:53.910> so<00:02:54.180> all<00:02:54.360> of<00:02:54.510> them<00:02:54.630> together

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
of that measure so all of them together

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:17.750 
of that measure so all of them together
go<00:02:55.140> like<00:02:55.320> this<00:02:55.590> right<00:03:16.190> very<00:03:17.190> simple<00:03:17.610> very

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
go like this right very simple very

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.130 
go like this right very simple very
simple<00:03:17.880> so<00:03:18.240> I'm<00:03:18.330> going<00:03:18.480> to<00:03:18.540> speed<00:03:18.780> it<00:03:18.900> up<00:03:18.990> a

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
simple so I'm going to speed it up a

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.110 
simple so I'm going to speed it up a
little<00:03:19.290> bit<00:03:19.530> after<00:03:19.860> you<00:03:20.340> get<00:03:20.580> those<00:03:20.760> basic

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
little bit after you get those basic

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:53.890 
little bit after you get those basic
things<00:03:21.300> down<00:03:21.480> you<00:03:21.510> need<00:03:21.750> to<00:03:21.810> speed<00:03:22.080> it<00:03:22.110> up<00:03:22.260> like

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.150 

so<00:03:54.900> that's<00:03:55.080> the<00:03:55.170> basic<00:03:55.470> group<00:03:55.620> the<00:03:55.950> other

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
so that's the basic group the other

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.650 
so that's the basic group the other
thing<00:03:56.459> once<00:03:56.640> you<00:03:56.700> get<00:03:56.880> it<00:03:56.970> up<00:03:57.090> to<00:03:57.180> speed<00:03:57.300> what

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
thing once you get it up to speed what

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.270 
thing once you get it up to speed what
