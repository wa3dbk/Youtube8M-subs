00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:05.779
 I'm going to show you how to do at home 

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:08.180
 mix to get skip or paint 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:09.769
 of slate in a very easy way and 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.309
 economic much more I bought the 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:16.700
 ready-made paint we will need 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:19.099
 hot water plaster white tail tail 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.840
 of carpenter acrylic paint both 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:23.029
 white as color if you want 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.849
 get some specific tonality and 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:28.880
 tools to make the mixture and to 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:31.640
 mix let's put a couple of 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.410
 spoons of plaster in our 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.180
 container 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.550
 It depends on the amount you want to make 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:41.969
 of paint you can do more or less 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:45.600
 and then let's put a stream of cola 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.550
 white and we're going to add a little trickle 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.230
 also hot water 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.780
 let's go mixing this 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.250
 so that we have a uniform dough and 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.930
 no lumps 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.730
 with hot water the truth is that it 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.460
 mix very well you will see that in a 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.890
 moment 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.250
 you have a kind of putty a little 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.250
 dense 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.380
 and when this is already 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:13.110
 let's add 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.530
 white acrylic paint 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.479
 a spray of paint 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.479
 and we are going to continue mixing 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.979
 The most important thing about this mix is that 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.649
 we do not remain too liquid or too dense 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.630
 more or less that you take a little bit and that 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:32.250
 fall out of the brush if you see that it is very 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.319
 Dense a little more water if 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.610
 you see that it is very liquid you can 

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:38.500
 put a little more plaster 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.600
 this is the white base with this 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.900
 we could paint directly here you 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.330
 you can add black if you want a 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:48.310
 dark slate base or for example in 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.180
 my case what I'm going to do is add 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:54.440
 a little lilac 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.440
 and we mix again 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.150
 and that's it when you have made the mixture 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.560
 more or less the same color you have the 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.330
 Chalkboard paint has no more mystery 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.420
 with this you can paint directly 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.820
 on top of a lot of surfaces and 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.680
 use it as a blackboard I will put you in the 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.420
 blog several examples of things that I have 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.890
 but if you have done me any questions 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.750
 you can leave it here in the comments 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.590
 I hope you like it and that you do your 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.590
 own painting
