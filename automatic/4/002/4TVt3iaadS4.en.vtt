the fixture has already been designed

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.990 
the fixture has already been designed
and<00:02:14.620> I'm<00:02:14.980> just<00:02:15.130> going<00:02:15.250> to<00:02:15.310> be<00:02:15.400> clamping<00:02:15.760> it<00:02:15.880> in

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
and I'm just going to be clamping it in

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:36.630 
and I'm just going to be clamping it in
right<00:02:16.180> now

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.790 

so<00:02:37.210> in<00:02:37.330> this<00:02:37.420> first<00:02:37.630> operation<00:02:38.320> once<00:02:38.620> I've

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
so in this first operation once I've

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.160 
so in this first operation once I've
secured<00:02:39.190> the<00:02:39.310> part<00:02:39.930> we're<00:02:40.930> going<00:02:41.050> to<00:02:41.110> be

take a look at it we can edit it we can

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.800 
take a look at it we can edit it we can
you<00:03:25.310> know<00:03:25.430> play<00:03:25.700> around<00:03:25.939> with<00:03:26.209> our<00:03:26.389> feeds<00:03:26.629> and

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
you know play around with our feeds and

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.170 
you know play around with our feeds and
speeds<00:03:26.900> and<00:03:27.319> decide<00:03:27.620> exactly<00:03:27.920> how<00:03:28.790> to<00:03:28.849> fine

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
speeds and decide exactly how to fine

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.990 
speeds and decide exactly how to fine
tune<00:03:29.209> the<00:03:29.569> program<00:03:29.920> with<00:03:30.920> the<00:03:31.129> drop<00:03:31.489> ssin<00:03:31.879> on

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
tune the program with the drop ssin on

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.940 
tune the program with the drop ssin on
this<00:03:32.120> machine<00:03:32.329> we<00:03:33.200> actually<00:03:33.500> get<00:03:33.620> to<00:03:33.650> see<00:03:33.769> a

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
this machine we actually get to see a

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.839 
this machine we actually get to see a
readout<00:03:34.430> of<00:03:35.379> what<00:03:36.379> the<00:03:36.650> parts<00:03:37.489> going<00:03:37.639> to<00:03:37.700> look

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:37.849 
readout of what the parts going to look

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:39.369 
readout of what the parts going to look
like<00:03:38.000> before<00:03:38.329> we<00:03:38.389> machine<00:03:38.840> it<00:03:38.959> all<00:03:39.079> the<00:03:39.200> tool

00:03:39.369 --> 00:03:39.379 
like before we machine it all the tool

00:03:39.379 --> 00:04:26.640 
like before we machine it all the tool
paths<00:03:39.709> and<00:03:40.159> all<00:03:40.340> that<00:03:40.819> on<00:03:41.329> the<00:03:41.599> control

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.410 

so<00:04:27.650> once<00:04:27.860> our<00:04:28.010> first<00:04:28.280> operation<00:04:28.730> is<00:04:29.030> complete

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.420 
so once our first operation is complete

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.830 
so once our first operation is complete
I<00:04:30.190> unclamp<00:04:31.190> it<00:04:31.310> from<00:04:31.430> the<00:04:31.550> machine<00:04:31.880> and<00:04:32.150> we're

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
I unclamp it from the machine and we're

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.030 
I unclamp it from the machine and we're
going<00:04:32.960> to<00:04:33.020> take<00:04:33.200> it<00:04:33.320> over<00:04:33.410> to<00:04:33.560> the<00:04:33.650> second

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
going to take it over to the second

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.890 
going to take it over to the second
operation<00:04:34.460> where<00:04:35.210> we'll<00:04:35.330> be<00:04:35.450> doing<00:04:35.630> the<00:04:35.750> back

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
operation where we'll be doing the back

00:04:35.900 --> 00:05:06.190 
operation where we'll be doing the back
side<00:04:36.139> of<00:04:36.169> the<00:04:36.350> park<00:05:04.270> so<00:05:05.270> the<00:05:05.600> first<00:05:05.810> operation

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 
side of the park so the first operation

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.530 
side of the park so the first operation
is<00:05:06.500> already<00:05:06.770> complete<00:05:07.160> and<00:05:07.370> the<00:05:08.240> second

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:08.540 
is already complete and the second

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:09.970 
is already complete and the second
operation<00:05:08.900> has<00:05:09.140> already<00:05:09.380> been<00:05:09.470> completed<00:05:09.740> in

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:09.980 
operation has already been completed in
