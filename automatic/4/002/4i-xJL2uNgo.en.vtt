00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
things you get on a bicycle deck so I

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.689 
things you get on a bicycle deck so I
really<00:00:51.719> don't<00:00:51.840> need<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.050> go<00:00:52.199> into<00:00:52.350> that<00:00:52.699> extra

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
really don't need to go into that extra

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.939 
really don't need to go into that extra
cards<00:00:53.969> I<00:00:54.090> really<00:00:54.329> like<00:00:54.480> this<00:00:54.690> deck<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.770> get<00:00:55.920> a

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
cards I really like this deck you get a

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.459 
cards I really like this deck you get a
dry<00:00:56.219> hidden<00:00:56.460> card<00:00:56.670> I<00:00:56.910> think<00:00:57.690> this<00:00:57.840> poses<00:00:58.140> such

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
dry hidden card I think this poses such

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.029 
dry hidden card I think this poses such
as<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.800> joker<00:00:59.340> but<00:00:59.609> and<00:01:00.109> then<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.320> get<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.680> double

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
as a joker but and then you get a double

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.009 
as a joker but and then you get a double
bagger<00:01:02.370> but<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.670> kind<00:01:03.180> of<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.359> special<00:01:03.719> one<00:01:03.870> on

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
bagger but a kind of a special one on

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.230 
bagger but a kind of a special one on
one<00:01:04.170> side<00:01:04.409> it's<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.680> reverse<00:01:04.949> image<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.610> the

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
one side it's a reverse image of the

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.010 
one side it's a reverse image of the
back<00:01:06.600> design<00:01:06.930> which<00:01:07.380> is<00:01:07.560> this<00:01:08.540> I'll<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.869> let

with that come with blank cards I think

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.969 
with that come with blank cards I think
they're<00:01:32.939> really<00:01:33.060> useful<00:01:33.720> in<00:01:33.990> really<00:01:34.590> visual

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
they're really useful in really visual

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.660 
they're really useful in really visual
magic<00:01:35.479> so<00:01:36.479> yeah<00:01:36.990> here's<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.500> deck<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:38.490> saw

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
magic so yeah here's the deck you saw

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.359 
magic so yeah here's the deck you saw
the<00:01:38.729> back<00:01:38.939> down<00:01:39.150> back<00:01:39.630> design<00:01:40.020> again<00:01:40.320> I<00:01:40.500> really

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
the back down back design again I really

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.980 
the back down back design again I really
like<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.670> design<00:01:41.790> when<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.360> spread<00:01:42.689> it<00:01:42.750> out<00:01:42.930> I

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
like the design when you spread it out I

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.830 
like the design when you spread it out I
think<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:43.500> looks<00:01:43.530> really<00:01:44.100> cool<00:01:44.540> the<00:01:45.540> borders

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
think it looks really cool the borders

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.620 
think it looks really cool the borders
are<00:01:45.930> pretty<00:01:46.200> thick<00:01:46.500> but<00:01:46.890> still<00:01:47.759> you<00:01:48.090> see<00:01:48.270> some

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
are pretty thick but still you see some

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.179 
are pretty thick but still you see some
of<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.810> yellow<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.470> just<00:01:49.680> really<00:01:49.920> stands

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
of the yellow and it just really stands

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.609 
of the yellow and it just really stands
out<00:01:50.570> so<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.689> borders<00:01:51.990> don't<00:01:52.170> really<00:01:52.350> have<00:01:52.500> to

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
out so the borders don't really have to

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.630 
out so the borders don't really have to
be<00:01:52.740> thin<00:01:53.009> for<00:01:53.939> it<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.210> stand<00:01:54.600> out<00:01:54.780> that<00:01:54.840> much

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
be thin for it to stand out that much

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.770 
be thin for it to stand out that much
let's<00:01:56.640> take<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:56.850> look<00:01:57.060> at<00:01:57.210> some<00:01:57.360> of<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.540> face

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
let's take a look at some of the face

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.690 
let's take a look at some of the face
cards<00:01:58.020> follow<00:01:58.439> my<00:01:58.619> favorite<00:01:58.979> aspect<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.579> this

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
cards follow my favorite aspect to this

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.520 
cards follow my favorite aspect to this
deck<00:01:59.969> I'll<00:02:00.210> just<00:02:00.360> take<00:02:00.689> out<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.759> Queen<00:02:02.759> Jack

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
deck I'll just take out the Queen Jack

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.850 
deck I'll just take out the Queen Jack
King<00:02:04.530> of<00:02:04.829> Spades<00:02:05.219> I<00:02:05.490> guess<00:02:07.550> there's

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
King of Spades I guess there's

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:10.740 
King of Spades I guess there's
I'll<00:02:09.490> take<00:02:09.670> a<00:02:09.729> look<00:02:09.940> at<00:02:10.030> some<00:02:10.149> red<00:02:10.330> ones<00:02:10.479> later

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
I'll take a look at some red ones later

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.320 
I'll take a look at some red ones later
but<00:02:11.290> I<00:02:11.560> really<00:02:12.010> really<00:02:12.640> like<00:02:12.910> these<00:02:13.090> face

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
but I really really like these face

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.800 
but I really really like these face
cards<00:02:13.660> sorry<00:02:13.870> about<00:02:14.020> the<00:02:14.110> clear<00:02:14.320> there<00:02:14.500> but

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
cards sorry about the clear there but

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.420 
cards sorry about the clear there but
it's<00:02:16.810> really<00:02:17.080> weird<00:02:17.380> that<00:02:17.560> with<00:02:17.950> a<00:02:17.980> red<00:02:18.310> and

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
it's really weird that with a red and

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.130 
it's really weird that with a red and
yellow<00:02:18.490> deck<00:02:18.910> they<00:02:19.120> even<00:02:19.390> added<00:02:19.510> some<00:02:19.840> green

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
yellow deck they even added some green

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.350 
yellow deck they even added some green
and<00:02:20.500> when<00:02:20.890> you<00:02:21.070> say<00:02:21.310> that<00:02:21.460> without<00:02:21.730> looking<00:02:22.270> at

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
and when you say that without looking at

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.540 
and when you say that without looking at
it<00:02:22.440> you<00:02:23.440> might<00:02:23.560> think<00:02:23.830> that<00:02:23.980> that<00:02:24.340> doesn't

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
it you might think that that doesn't

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.190 
it you might think that that doesn't
seem<00:02:24.880> like<00:02:25.060> they<00:02:25.180> would<00:02:25.270> go<00:02:25.420> together<00:02:25.540> but<00:02:25.750> I

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
seem like they would go together but I

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.270 
seem like they would go together but I
mean<00:02:26.920> look<00:02:27.250> at<00:02:27.340> that<00:02:28.050> it's<00:02:29.050> just<00:02:29.260> such<00:02:29.470> so<00:02:30.040> cool

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
mean look at that it's just such so cool

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.160 
mean look at that it's just such so cool
the<00:02:31.000> artwork<00:02:31.720> is<00:02:31.960> really<00:02:32.800> stunning<00:02:33.580> I<00:02:34.170> really

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
the artwork is really stunning I really

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.340 
the artwork is really stunning I really
like<00:02:35.320> it<00:02:35.500> and<00:02:36.030> then<00:02:37.030> let<00:02:37.750> me<00:02:37.870> show<00:02:38.050> you<00:02:38.140> some

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
like it and then let me show you some

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.699 
like it and then let me show you some
bread<00:02:38.830> face<00:02:39.040> cards<00:02:39.690> these<00:02:40.690> are<00:02:40.870> a<00:02:40.900> bit<00:02:41.080> like<00:02:41.350> I

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
bread face cards these are a bit like I

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.410 
bread face cards these are a bit like I
don't<00:02:42.340> know<00:02:42.400> how<00:02:42.520> to<00:02:42.580> explain<00:02:42.940> it<00:02:43.060> they're<00:02:43.390> a

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
don't know how to explain it they're a

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.100 
don't know how to explain it they're a
bit<00:02:43.600> pale<00:02:44.020> I<00:02:44.440> don't<00:02:45.070> know<00:02:45.360> pale<00:02:46.360> i'd<00:02:46.600> say<00:02:46.870> maybe

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
bit pale I don't know pale i'd say maybe

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.850 
bit pale I don't know pale i'd say maybe
um<00:02:48.090> but<00:02:49.090> they<00:02:49.209> still<00:02:49.420> got<00:02:49.600> the<00:02:49.720> green<00:02:49.989> just

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
um but they still got the green just

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.540 
um but they still got the green just
more<00:02:51.040> yellow<00:02:51.340> and<00:02:52.440> yeah<00:02:53.440> i<00:02:53.620> really<00:02:54.040> really

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
more yellow and yeah i really really

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.690 
more yellow and yeah i really really
like<00:02:54.790> the<00:02:54.910> red<00:02:55.060> ones<00:02:55.270> too<00:02:56.250> so<00:02:57.250> yeah<00:02:57.459> that's

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
like the red ones too so yeah that's

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.960 
like the red ones too so yeah that's
basically<00:02:58.000> the<00:02:58.360> design<00:02:59.100> i'll<00:03:00.100> show<00:03:00.310> you<00:03:00.370> a<00:03:00.489> bit

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
basically the design i'll show you a bit

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.260 
basically the design i'll show you a bit
of<00:03:01.030> the<00:03:01.570> number<00:03:02.380> cards<00:03:02.650> to<00:03:02.890> the<00:03:03.790> number<00:03:04.030> cards

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:04.270 
of the number cards to the number cards

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.210 
of the number cards to the number cards
are<00:03:04.390> actually<00:03:04.810> a<00:03:04.840> bit<00:03:05.020> different<00:03:05.470> um<00:03:05.650> they're

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
are actually a bit different um they're

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.710 
are actually a bit different um they're
a<00:03:06.250> bit<00:03:06.400> more<00:03:06.550> pointy<00:03:06.880> and<00:03:07.030> that<00:03:07.300> they're<00:03:07.480> a<00:03:07.510> bit

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
a bit more pointy and that they're a bit

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.620 
a bit more pointy and that they're a bit
smaller<00:03:08.080> I<00:03:08.350> don't<00:03:08.920> know<00:03:08.980> if<00:03:09.040> you<00:03:09.130> can<00:03:09.280> tell<00:03:09.550> but

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
smaller I don't know if you can tell but

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.479 
smaller I don't know if you can tell but
the<00:03:10.630> spades<00:03:10.959> are<00:03:11.320> a<00:03:11.560> bit<00:03:11.800> smaller<00:03:12.100> and<00:03:12.280> a<00:03:12.340> bit

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
the spades are a bit smaller and a bit

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:13.620 
the spades are a bit smaller and a bit
more<00:03:12.640> point<00:03:12.850> you<00:03:12.970> can't<00:03:13.120> have<00:03:13.209> to<00:03:13.330> see<00:03:13.510> it<00:03:13.600> in

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
more point you can't have to see it in

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.110 
more point you can't have to see it in
person<00:03:13.980> the<00:03:14.980> clubs<00:03:15.250> and<00:03:15.400> the<00:03:15.489> diamonds<00:03:16.000> are

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
person the clubs and the diamonds are

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.570 
person the clubs and the diamonds are
the<00:03:16.150> same<00:03:16.480> but<00:03:16.510> the<00:03:16.810> hearts<00:03:17.170> and<00:03:17.380> the<00:03:17.580> spades

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
the same but the hearts and the spades

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.340 
the same but the hearts and the spades
are<00:03:18.850> a<00:03:18.880> bit<00:03:19.030> pointing<00:03:19.480> and<00:03:19.660> they're<00:03:20.110> a<00:03:20.140> bit

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
are a bit pointing and they're a bit

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.850 
are a bit pointing and they're a bit
smaller<00:03:21.030> the<00:03:22.030> last<00:03:22.239> the<00:03:22.630> design<00:03:23.290> let's<00:03:23.709> get

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
smaller the last the design let's get

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.370 
smaller the last the design let's get
into<00:03:23.920> the<00:03:24.280> handling<00:03:24.820> which<00:03:25.180> you're<00:03:26.140> going<00:03:26.260> to

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
into the handling which you're going to

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.870 
into the handling which you're going to
be<00:03:26.470> disappointed<00:03:26.620> to<00:03:27.130> hear<00:03:27.340> but<00:03:28.739> the<00:03:29.880> handling

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
be disappointed to hear but the handling

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:36.210 
be disappointed to hear but the handling
is<00:03:31.120> not<00:03:32.019> great<00:03:32.950> at<00:03:33.489> all<00:03:34.530> there's<00:03:35.530> a<00:03:35.620> lot<00:03:35.709> of<00:03:35.890> ink

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
is not great at all there's a lot of ink

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.340 
is not great at all there's a lot of ink
saturation<00:03:36.970> which<00:03:37.000> means<00:03:37.450> there's<00:03:37.900> just<00:03:38.140> a

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
saturation which means there's just a

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.830 
saturation which means there's just a
lot<00:03:38.590> of<00:03:38.769> ink<00:03:39.040> on<00:03:39.220> these<00:03:39.760> cards<00:03:40.090> as<00:03:40.450> you

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
lot of ink on these cards as you

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.590 
lot of ink on these cards as you
probably<00:03:41.410> could<00:03:41.650> tell<00:03:41.830> in<00:03:42.250> my<00:03:42.970> last<00:03:43.180> review<00:03:43.420> i

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
probably could tell in my last review i

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.870 
probably could tell in my last review i
portrayed<00:03:44.560> this<00:03:44.739> deck<00:03:44.980> as<00:03:45.190> pretty<00:03:45.820> good

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
portrayed this deck as pretty good

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.170 
portrayed this deck as pretty good
handling<00:03:46.420> and<00:03:46.660> it's<00:03:47.350> just<00:03:47.739> not<00:03:47.890> true<00:03:48.180> this

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
handling and it's just not true this

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.330 
handling and it's just not true this
stock<00:03:49.480> is<00:03:49.810> a<00:03:50.290> bit<00:03:50.500> softer<00:03:50.980> than<00:03:51.100> a<00:03:51.160> normal

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
stock is a bit softer than a normal

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.880 
stock is a bit softer than a normal
bicycle<00:03:52.030> stuff<00:03:52.299> about<00:03:53.110> the<00:03:53.260> same<00:03:53.470> but<00:03:53.680> a<00:03:53.709> bit

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
bicycle stuff about the same but a bit

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.699 
bicycle stuff about the same but a bit
softer<00:03:54.340> which<00:03:55.090> is<00:03:55.450> just<00:03:55.690> a<00:03:55.930> bit<00:03:56.140> too<00:03:56.290> soft<00:03:56.590> for

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
softer which is just a bit too soft for

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.720 
softer which is just a bit too soft for
me<00:03:56.910> when<00:03:57.910> you<00:03:58.030> spring<00:03:58.360> it<00:03:58.390> doesn't<00:03:58.989> feel<00:03:59.730> so

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
me when you spring it doesn't feel so

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.500 
me when you spring it doesn't feel so
great<00:04:00.880> in<00:04:01.090> the<00:04:01.180> hands<00:04:01.720> in<00:04:01.930> I<00:04:02.580> don't<00:04:03.580> know<00:04:03.670> just

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
great in the hands in I don't know just

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.740 
great in the hands in I don't know just
don't<00:04:04.660> don't<00:04:05.140> love<00:04:05.410> the<00:04:05.620> stock<00:04:06.010> and

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
don't don't love the stock and

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.470 
don't don't love the stock and
smoothness<00:04:07.750> also<00:04:08.560> a<00:04:08.590> problem<00:04:09.160> since<00:04:10.150> there's

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
smoothness also a problem since there's

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.180 
smoothness also a problem since there's
so<00:04:10.540> much<00:04:10.780> ink<00:04:11.110> it's<00:04:11.560> almost<00:04:11.890> like<00:04:12.070> you're

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
so much ink it's almost like you're

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.039 
so much ink it's almost like you're
holding<00:04:12.370> a<00:04:12.610> black<00:04:12.820> deck<00:04:13.150> in<00:04:13.420> the<00:04:13.780> way<00:04:13.870> it

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:14.049 
holding a black deck in the way it

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:19.289 
holding a black deck in the way it
clumps<00:04:15.120> so<00:04:16.120> much<00:04:17.130> after<00:04:18.130> you<00:04:18.310> take<00:04:18.970> the<00:04:19.090> buck

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
clumps so much after you take the buck

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:20.969 
clumps so much after you take the buck
take<00:04:19.660> the<00:04:19.810> deck<00:04:19.989> out<00:04:20.140> of<00:04:20.260> the<00:04:20.320> box<00:04:20.470> after<00:04:20.709> not

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:20.979 
take the deck out of the box after not

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:22.450 
take the deck out of the box after not
using<00:04:21.250> it<00:04:21.340> for<00:04:21.489> a<00:04:21.520> while<00:04:21.700> it

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
using it for a while it

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.059 
using it for a while it
l<00:04:22.550> fan<00:04:22.759> okay<00:04:22.970> but<00:04:23.449> then<00:04:23.630> once<00:04:24.050> you<00:04:24.259> start<00:04:25.009> to

00:04:25.059 --> 00:04:25.069 
l fan okay but then once you start to

00:04:25.069 --> 00:04:27.969 
l fan okay but then once you start to
use<00:04:25.310> it<00:04:25.460> for<00:04:25.669> 5-10<00:04:26.240> minutes<00:04:26.270> it<00:04:27.080> just<00:04:27.410> starts

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:27.979 
use it for 5-10 minutes it just starts

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:30.790 
use it for 5-10 minutes it just starts
to<00:04:28.130> get<00:04:28.220> blocky<00:04:28.580> I<00:04:29.020> just<00:04:30.020> took<00:04:30.169> this<00:04:30.350> deck<00:04:30.590> aft

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
to get blocky I just took this deck aft

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.890 
to get blocky I just took this deck aft
out<00:04:31.099> after<00:04:31.669> a<00:04:31.699> while<00:04:31.849> so<00:04:32.120> you<00:04:32.210> can<00:04:32.330> see<00:04:32.539> it<00:04:32.720> I

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
out after a while so you can see it I

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.260 
out after a while so you can see it I
got<00:04:33.560> a<00:04:33.590> pretty<00:04:33.860> even<00:04:34.069> fan<00:04:34.460> and<00:04:34.759> it<00:04:34.910> does<00:04:35.090> look

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
got a pretty even fan and it does look

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.999 
got a pretty even fan and it does look
okay<00:04:36.050> in<00:04:36.080> fans<00:04:36.410> the<00:04:36.710> border<00:04:37.039> is<00:04:37.160> too<00:04:37.729> thick<00:04:38.000> but

00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:39.009 
okay in fans the border is too thick but

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:41.920 
okay in fans the border is too thick but
and<00:04:40.009> the<00:04:40.520> front<00:04:40.729> looks<00:04:40.940> pretty<00:04:41.180> cool<00:04:41.360> too<00:04:41.630> with

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
and the front looks pretty cool too with

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.589 
and the front looks pretty cool too with
the<00:04:42.110> red<00:04:42.349> meal<00:04:42.590> it's<00:04:42.919> a<00:04:43.009> nice<00:04:43.160> contrast<00:04:43.599> but

00:04:44.589 --> 00:04:44.599 
the red meal it's a nice contrast but

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:46.659 
the red meal it's a nice contrast but
once<00:04:45.110> you<00:04:45.319> just<00:04:45.560> play<00:04:45.770> with<00:04:45.919> this<00:04:46.099> deck<00:04:46.370> for<00:04:46.639> a

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:46.669 
once you just play with this deck for a

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:49.830 
once you just play with this deck for a
while<00:04:46.940> it<00:04:47.240> just<00:04:47.800> just<00:04:48.800> doesn't<00:04:49.160> perform<00:04:49.310> well

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
while it just just doesn't perform well

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.170 
while it just just doesn't perform well
um<00:04:51.340> well<00:04:52.340> Paul<00:04:52.550> spreads<00:04:52.880> are<00:04:53.000> almost

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
um well Paul spreads are almost

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.120 
um well Paul spreads are almost
impossible<00:04:53.360> to<00:04:53.930> do<00:04:54.110> actually<00:04:54.590> the<00:04:54.740> stock<00:04:54.979> is

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
impossible to do actually the stock is

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:58.779 
impossible to do actually the stock is
just<00:04:55.310> too<00:04:55.490> soft<00:04:55.849> and<00:04:56.830> pressure<00:04:57.830> fans<00:04:58.250> actually

00:04:58.779 --> 00:04:58.789 
just too soft and pressure fans actually

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:00.610 
just too soft and pressure fans actually
pretty<00:04:59.150> good<00:04:59.449> because<00:04:59.599> it's<00:04:59.930> a<00:05:00.020> soft<00:05:00.289> stock

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
pretty good because it's a soft stock

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.450 
pretty good because it's a soft stock
and<00:05:00.889> the<00:05:01.430> cards<00:05:01.699> are<00:05:01.910> slippery<00:05:02.330> enough<00:05:02.479> to<00:05:02.840> do

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
and the cards are slippery enough to do

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.510 
and the cards are slippery enough to do
pressure<00:05:04.460> fans<00:05:05.080> but<00:05:06.080> if<00:05:06.500> are<00:05:06.919> you<00:05:07.130> I'd<00:05:07.340> only

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
pressure fans but if are you I'd only

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.060 
pressure fans but if are you I'd only
get<00:05:07.789> this<00:05:07.970> deck<00:05:08.210> if<00:05:08.449> you're<00:05:08.690> like<00:05:09.530> a<00:05:09.560> flourish

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.070 
get this deck if you're like a flourish

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:11.770 
get this deck if you're like a flourish
sure<00:05:10.250> and<00:05:10.789> even<00:05:10.880> then<00:05:11.180> it's<00:05:11.360> kind<00:05:11.570> of<00:05:11.630> risky

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:11.780 
sure and even then it's kind of risky

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.890 
sure and even then it's kind of risky
because<00:05:12.110> of<00:05:12.380> the<00:05:12.590> the<00:05:13.490> edges<00:05:14.000> it's<00:05:14.690> like<00:05:14.870> a

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:14.900 
because of the the edges it's like a

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:17.290 
because of the the edges it's like a
black<00:05:15.199> deck<00:05:15.500> any<00:05:15.830> I<00:05:16.340> don't<00:05:16.820> know<00:05:16.970> if<00:05:17.090> you<00:05:17.150> can

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
black deck any I don't know if you can

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.640 
black deck any I don't know if you can
see<00:05:17.539> this<00:05:17.690> but<00:05:18.699> the<00:05:19.699> edges<00:05:20.240> are<00:05:20.650> they're

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 
see this but the edges are they're

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.270 
see this but the edges are they're
chipped<00:05:22.280> a<00:05:22.720> lot<00:05:23.720> almost<00:05:24.409> more<00:05:24.800> than<00:05:24.830> a<00:05:25.009> black

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.280 
chipped a lot almost more than a black

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.399 
chipped a lot almost more than a black
deck<00:05:25.550> which<00:05:26.270> isn't<00:05:26.570> very<00:05:26.630> noticeable<00:05:27.259> because

00:05:27.399 --> 00:05:27.409 
deck which isn't very noticeable because

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:29.770 
deck which isn't very noticeable because
its<00:05:27.680> a<00:05:27.770> bright<00:05:27.949> back<00:05:28.220> design<00:05:28.639> but<00:05:29.539> when<00:05:29.659> you're

its a bright back design but when you're
handling<00:05:30.050> and<00:05:30.530> playing<00:05:31.280> around<00:05:31.490> with<00:05:31.699> it<00:05:31.909> does

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.150 
handling and playing around with it does

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:35.620 
handling and playing around with it does
get<00:05:32.330> kind<00:05:32.539> of<00:05:32.599> annoying<00:05:33.009> so<00:05:34.009> magicians<00:05:34.820> don't

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:35.630 
get kind of annoying so magicians don't
