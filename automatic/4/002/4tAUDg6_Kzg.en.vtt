00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
game play into this online you'll

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.069 
game play into this online you'll
probably<00:00:59.820> get<00:01:00.030> into<00:01:00.180> these<00:01:00.390> top<00:01:00.660> sections

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
probably get into these top sections

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.100 
probably get into these top sections
here<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:01.500> top<00:01:02.250> 1%<00:01:02.879> and<00:01:03.090> that's<00:01:03.510> quite<00:01:03.719> hard<00:01:04.049> to

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
here so top 1% and that's quite hard to

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.740 
here so top 1% and that's quite hard to
achieve<00:01:04.290> but<00:01:04.680> top<00:01:04.860> 1%<00:01:05.430> will<00:01:05.640> give<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:05.939> two<00:01:06.240> so

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
achieve but top 1% will give you two so

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.090 
achieve but top 1% will give you two so
that's<00:01:06.960> literally<00:01:07.409> only<00:01:07.650> getting<00:01:08.010> your

in a good position at the moment but

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.850 
in a good position at the moment but
that's<00:02:21.270> quite<00:02:21.660> hard<00:02:21.930> more<00:02:22.260> so<00:02:22.410> hard<00:02:22.680> to

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
that's quite hard more so hard to

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.410 
that's quite hard more so hard to
maintain<00:02:23.010> its<00:02:23.400> a<00:02:23.490> lot<00:02:23.700> of<00:02:23.760> gameplays<00:02:24.209> and

because I'll need pretty much use about

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.970 
because I'll need pretty much use about
one<00:02:26.640> or<00:02:26.730> two<00:02:26.760> characters<00:02:27.410> to<00:02:28.410> obviously<00:02:28.770> try

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
you see what a top 10 has got an Isis

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.600 
you see what a top 10 has got an Isis
ridiculous<00:03:10.620> together<00:03:10.920> unless<00:03:11.489> you're

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
ridiculous together unless you're

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.699 
ridiculous together unless you're
playing<00:03:11.820> like<00:03:11.970> a<00:03:12.120> maniac<00:03:12.660> and<00:03:13.080> I<00:03:13.410> don't<00:03:13.590> do

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
playing like a maniac and I don't do

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:18.490 
playing like a maniac and I don't do
that<00:03:14.090> so<00:03:15.090> yeah<00:03:15.930> I<00:03:15.959> think<00:03:16.280> at<00:03:17.280> most<00:03:17.610> I<00:03:17.880> might

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
that so yeah I think at most I might

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.970 
that so yeah I think at most I might
potentially<00:03:19.500> maintain<00:03:20.400> this<00:03:20.549> area<00:03:20.970> not<00:03:21.390> sure

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
potentially maintain this area not sure

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.250 
potentially maintain this area not sure
but<00:03:22.980> it's<00:03:23.190> been<00:03:23.519> a<00:03:23.549> lot<00:03:23.970> harder<00:03:24.329> than<00:03:24.600> the<00:03:24.870> Ares

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
but it's been a lot harder than the Ares

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.330 
but it's been a lot harder than the Ares
challenge<00:03:25.650> because<00:03:25.890> a<00:03:25.920> lot<00:03:26.190> of<00:03:26.220> people

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
challenge because a lot of people

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.180 
challenge because a lot of people
actually<00:03:26.940> playing<00:03:27.180> online<00:03:27.360> now<00:03:27.920> and<00:03:28.920> I<00:03:29.010> think

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
actually playing online now and I think

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.920 
actually playing online now and I think
a<00:03:29.250> lot<00:03:29.430> of<00:03:29.459> people<00:03:29.519> want<00:03:30.000> Cassandra<00:03:30.600> came<00:03:30.780> back

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
a lot of people want Cassandra came back

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.569 
a lot of people want Cassandra came back
yard<00:03:31.140> because<00:03:31.290> of<00:03:31.560> her<00:03:31.739> tactical<00:03:32.250> technique

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
yard because of her tactical technique

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:35.350 
yard because of her tactical technique
which<00:03:32.730> is<00:03:32.910> her<00:03:33.600> passive<00:03:33.989> which<00:03:34.110> is<00:03:34.290> amazing

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
which is her passive which is amazing

which is her passive which is amazing
I'll<00:03:36.360> just<00:03:36.540> wait<00:03:37.530> for<00:03:37.590> its<00:03:37.769> cycle<00:03:38.070> over<00:03:38.310> but

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
I'll just wait for its cycle over but

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.370 
I'll just wait for its cycle over but
when<00:03:39.209> you<00:03:39.329> see<00:03:39.510> and<00:03:39.720> when<00:03:39.840> you<00:03:39.870> use<00:03:40.110> a<00:03:40.140> you
