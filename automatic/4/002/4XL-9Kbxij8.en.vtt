that's a big part of it another thing is

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:07.800 
that's a big part of it another thing is
the<00:04:02.950> controller<00:04:03.579> oh<00:04:04.530> man<00:04:05.530> i<00:04:06.180> used<00:04:07.180> to<00:04:07.480> be<00:04:07.630> i

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810

which is the controller is such

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.500 
which is the controller is such
underrate<00:04:43.250> it's<00:04:43.520> so<00:04:43.670> underrated<00:04:44.180> how

everything being responsive it's just

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.290 
everything being responsive it's just
the<00:04:51.560> add<00:04:51.710> so<00:04:52.010> much<00:04:52.160> the<00:04:52.370> game<00:04:52.610> especially<00:04:52.730> not

the<00:04:59.420> same<00:04:59.960> amount<00:04:59.990> of<00:05:00.350> feedback<00:05:00.590> that<00:05:00.830> you

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
the same amount of feedback that you

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.610 
the same amount of feedback that you
would<00:05:01.610> and<00:05:02.080> it<00:05:03.080> would<00:05:03.170> give<00:05:03.290> you<00:05:03.410> a<00:05:03.440> different

would and it would give you a different
amount<00:05:03.860> of<00:05:04.010> feedback<00:05:04.190> if<00:05:04.640> you<00:05:04.730> shoot<00:05:04.940> like<00:05:05.000> an

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
amount of feedback if you shoot like an

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.300 
amount of feedback if you shoot like an
SMG<00:05:05.540> or<00:05:05.780> something<00:05:06.080> like<00:05:06.140> that<00:05:06.200> so<00:05:06.530> it's<00:05:07.160> just

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
SMG or something like that so it's just

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.210 
SMG or something like that so it's just
it<00:05:07.580> keeps<00:05:07.790> adding<00:05:08.000> more<00:05:08.150> to<00:05:08.420> the<00:05:08.450> games<00:05:09.220> the

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
it keeps adding more to the games the

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.860 
it keeps adding more to the games the
next<00:05:10.520> thing<00:05:10.670> something<00:05:11.510> that<00:05:11.660> a<00:05:11.690> lot<00:05:11.750> of

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
next thing something that a lot of

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.090 
next thing something that a lot of
people<00:05:11.960> don't<00:05:12.320> like<00:05:12.380> because<00:05:12.800> they<00:05:12.920> actually

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
people don't like because they actually

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.330 
people don't like because they actually
raise<00:05:13.520> the<00:05:13.700> price<00:05:13.910> on<00:05:13.940> Xbox<00:05:14.510> one<00:05:14.630> is<00:05:15.340> to

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
raise the price on Xbox one is to

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.640 
raise the price on Xbox one is to
connect<00:05:16.700> and<00:05:17.020> I<00:05:18.020> think<00:05:18.320> they're<00:05:18.440> connected

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
connect and I think they're connected

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.800 
connect and I think they're connected
something<00:05:19.130> so<00:05:19.280> cool<00:05:19.550> for<00:05:19.580> the<00:05:19.850> future<00:05:20.210> maybe

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
something so cool for the future maybe

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.390 
something so cool for the future maybe
you<00:05:21.020> guys<00:05:21.200> don't<00:05:21.260> see<00:05:21.710> it<00:05:21.800> right<00:05:21.950> now<00:05:21.980> but<00:05:22.340> i

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
you guys don't see it right now but i

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.610 
you guys don't see it right now but i
think<00:05:22.760> the<00:05:22.850> kinect<00:05:23.240> will<00:05:23.810> somehow<00:05:24.080> in<00:05:24.500> the

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
think the kinect will somehow in the

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.410 
think the kinect will somehow in the
future<00:05:24.980> I<00:05:25.250> hope<00:05:25.430> to<00:05:25.610> integrate<00:05:26.180> this<00:05:26.360> into

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:26.420 
future I hope to integrate this into

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:28.300 
future I hope to integrate this into
games<00:05:26.930> will<00:05:27.230> be<00:05:27.350> able<00:05:27.440> to<00:05:27.680> like<00:05:27.830> scan<00:05:28.160> your

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 
your body you can obviously going to be

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:42.910

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:51.260 
screen you know if Microsoft does things

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.260 
screen you know if Microsoft does things
correctly<00:05:51.770> and<00:05:52.070> they<00:05:52.460> make<00:05:52.670> this<00:05:52.820> happens

correctly and they make this happens

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:54.760 
correctly and they make this happens
they<00:05:53.450> will<00:05:53.480> add<00:05:53.810> a<00:05:53.840> lot<00:05:54.260> more<00:05:54.470> to<00:05:54.680> the

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:54.770 
they will add a lot more to the

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:57.280 
they will add a lot more to the
experience<00:05:55.340> because<00:05:55.820> it<00:05:56.780> would<00:05:56.990> just<00:05:57.110> be<00:05:57.260> like

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:57.290 
experience because it would just be like

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.040

a crazy party fest every night playing
on<00:06:00.260> xbox<00:06:00.500> live<00:06:00.890> I<00:06:01.220> can't<00:06:02.180> say<00:06:02.330> more<00:06:02.510> to<00:06:02.630> connect

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:02.990 
on xbox live I can't say more to connect

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:04.870 
on xbox live I can't say more to connect
will<00:06:03.290> just<00:06:03.530> add<00:06:03.650> so<00:06:03.950> much<00:06:04.160> apart<00:06:04.580> from<00:06:04.760> the

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:04.880 
will just add so much apart from the

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.420 
will just add so much apart from the
games<00:06:05.090> that<00:06:05.300> will<00:06:05.450> be<00:06:05.600> made<00:06:06.140> for<00:06:06.380> Kinect<00:06:06.740> also

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:07.430 
games that will be made for Kinect also

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:08.920 
games that will be made for Kinect also
something<00:06:07.730> that<00:06:07.880> I<00:06:08.030> think<00:06:08.330> people<00:06:08.510> are

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:08.930 
something that I think people are

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:11.800 
something that I think people are
overlooking<00:06:09.530> or<00:06:10.160> are<00:06:11.000> simply<00:06:11.360> under

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:11.810 
overlooking or are simply under

estimating<00:06:12.410> is<00:06:12.560> the<00:06:12.890> cloud<00:06:13.900> Microsoft<00:06:14.900> has

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:14.990 
estimating is the cloud Microsoft has

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:17.560 
estimating is the cloud Microsoft has
been<00:06:15.350> touting<00:06:15.860> on<00:06:16.040> how<00:06:16.430> the<00:06:16.490> cloud<00:06:16.940> will<00:06:17.300> add

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:17.570 
been touting on how the cloud will add

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:21.640 
been touting on how the cloud will add
to<00:06:18.500> gaming<00:06:18.980> and<00:06:19.220> to<00:06:19.610> the<00:06:19.730> system<00:06:20.210> and<00:06:20.620> how<00:06:21.620> it

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:21.650 
to gaming and to the system and how it

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:23.860 
to gaming and to the system and how it
will<00:06:22.190> help<00:06:22.430> boost<00:06:22.700> the<00:06:23.060> system's<00:06:23.600> power

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:23.870 
will help boost the system's power

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:27.850 
will help boost the system's power
because<00:06:24.500> it<00:06:25.250> can<00:06:25.550> send<00:06:25.880> some<00:06:26.240> not<00:06:27.050> CPU

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:27.860 
because it can send some not CPU

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.060 
because it can send some not CPU
intensive<00:06:28.330> properties<00:06:29.330> or<00:06:29.680> problems<00:06:30.680> onto

intensive properties or problems onto

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:33.310 
intensive properties or problems onto
the<00:06:31.580> cloud<00:06:31.880> so<00:06:32.180> that<00:06:32.300> the<00:06:32.450> cloud<00:06:32.720> can<00:06:32.990> do<00:06:33.140> them

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:33.320 
the cloud so that the cloud can do them

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.129 
the cloud so that the cloud can do them
and<00:06:33.470> send<00:06:33.650> it<00:06:33.800> back<00:06:33.950> to<00:06:34.280> the<00:06:34.850> xbox

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:36.139 
and send it back to the xbox

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:38.950 
and send it back to the xbox
now<00:06:36.499> a<00:06:36.530> lot<00:06:36.889> of<00:06:36.919> people<00:06:37.099> are<00:06:37.310> saying<00:06:37.490> well<00:06:37.960> how

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:38.960 
now a lot of people are saying well how

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.360 
now a lot of people are saying well how
is<00:06:39.080> it<00:06:39.199> going<00:06:39.319> to<00:06:39.409> be<00:06:39.499> possible<00:06:40.069> with<00:06:40.219> the

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:40.370 
is it going to be possible with the

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:43.629 
is it going to be possible with the
limits<00:06:40.729> of<00:06:41.620> internet<00:06:42.620> connections<00:06:43.159> nowadays

00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:43.639 
limits of internet connections nowadays

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:44.980 
limits of internet connections nowadays
I<00:06:43.819> understand<00:06:44.270> what<00:06:44.479> people<00:06:44.599> say<00:06:44.930> but

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:44.990 
I understand what people say but

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:46.779 
I understand what people say but
internet<00:06:45.529> connections<00:06:46.039> they<00:06:46.370> don't<00:06:46.550> remain

00:06:46.779 --> 00:06:46.789 
internet connections they don't remain

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:48.760 
internet connections they don't remain
the<00:06:46.969> same<00:06:47.180> they<00:06:47.419> keep<00:06:47.659> improving<00:06:48.289> over<00:06:48.740> time

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:48.770 
the same they keep improving over time

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:50.709 
the same they keep improving over time
people<00:06:49.069> keep<00:06:49.639> getting<00:06:49.969> better<00:06:50.090> connections

00:06:50.709 --> 00:06:50.719 
people keep getting better connections

00:06:50.719 --> 00:06:53.559 
people keep getting better connections
as<00:06:50.900> applications<00:06:51.560> and<00:06:51.949> software<00:06:52.180> and<00:06:53.180> things

00:06:53.559 --> 00:06:53.569 
as applications and software and things

00:06:53.569 --> 00:06:58.769 
as applications and software and things
demand<00:06:54.289> more<00:06:54.860> bandwidth<00:06:55.400> so<00:06:56.330> as<00:06:56.919> let's<00:06:57.919> say<00:06:58.009> 4k

00:06:58.769 --> 00:06:58.779 
demand more bandwidth so as let's say 4k

demand more bandwidth so as let's say 4k
movies<00:06:59.779> are<00:07:00.590> become<00:07:01.219> the<00:07:01.340> norm<00:07:01.550> then<00:07:01.969> you're

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:02.120 
movies are become the norm then you're

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.450 
movies are become the norm then you're
going<00:07:02.210> to<00:07:02.270> need<00:07:02.749> more<00:07:03.319> internet<00:07:03.860> faster

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:04.460 
going to need more internet faster

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:06.339 
going to need more internet faster
internet<00:07:04.849> in<00:07:05.300> order<00:07:05.479> to<00:07:05.659> be<00:07:05.840> able<00:07:05.930> to<00:07:06.080> stream

00:07:06.339 --> 00:07:06.349 
internet in order to be able to stream

00:07:06.349 --> 00:07:08.140 
internet in order to be able to stream
those<00:07:06.560> type<00:07:06.770> of<00:07:06.800> movies<00:07:07.219> so<00:07:07.520> as<00:07:07.699> internet

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:08.150 
those type of movies so as internet

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:11.379 
those type of movies so as internet
demands<00:07:08.539> get<00:07:08.870> bigger<00:07:09.199> and<00:07:09.729> costs<00:07:10.729> go<00:07:11.090> lower

00:07:11.379 --> 00:07:11.389 
demands get bigger and costs go lower

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:13.719 
demands get bigger and costs go lower
then<00:07:12.139> you<00:07:12.259> will<00:07:12.379> see<00:07:12.560> people<00:07:12.889> adopting<00:07:13.340> faster

00:07:13.719 --> 00:07:13.729 
then you will see people adopting faster

00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:15.490 
then you will see people adopting faster
faster<00:07:14.150> speeds<00:07:14.539> so<00:07:14.779> the<00:07:14.900> cloud<00:07:15.139> is<00:07:15.289> going<00:07:15.439> to

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:15.500 
faster speeds so the cloud is going to

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:17.350 
faster speeds so the cloud is going to
become<00:07:15.860> more<00:07:16.219> and<00:07:16.340> more<00:07:16.430> prevalent<00:07:16.669> in<00:07:17.180> the

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:17.360 
become more and more prevalent in the
