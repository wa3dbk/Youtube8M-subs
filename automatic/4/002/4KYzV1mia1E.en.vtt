00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
or a banner around the tree you cannot

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.110 
or a banner around the tree you cannot
put<00:00:59.039> tanglefoot<00:00:59.520> even<00:00:59.850> though<00:00:59.940> it's

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
put tanglefoot even though it's

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.299 
put tanglefoot even though it's
organically<00:01:00.870> certified<00:01:01.070> directly<00:01:02.070> on<00:01:02.219> the

organically certified directly on the

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.310 
organically certified directly on the
bark<00:01:02.550> of<00:01:02.670> any<00:01:02.850> fruit<00:01:03.090> or<00:01:03.239> nut<00:01:03.449> tree<00:01:03.690> so<00:01:03.930> we<00:01:04.080> plan

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
bark of any fruit or nut tree so we plan

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.560 
bark of any fruit or nut tree so we plan
to<00:01:04.530> apply<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:04.769> barrier<00:01:05.250> with<00:01:05.460> blue<00:01:05.790> masking

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
to apply a barrier with blue masking

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.480 
to apply a barrier with blue masking
tape<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.409> they<00:01:07.560> don't<00:01:07.920> get<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.130> other<00:01:08.189> side

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
tape and they don't get the other side

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.490 
tape and they don't get the other side
we<00:01:08.610> figured<00:01:08.820> this<00:01:08.909> will<00:01:09.030> be<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.270> best<00:01:09.510> so<00:01:10.080> if

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
we figured this will be the best so if

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.350 
we figured this will be the best so if
one<00:01:10.740> of<00:01:10.860> them<00:01:10.950> fails<00:01:11.159> we'll<00:01:11.790> at<00:01:11.850> least<00:01:11.880> protect

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
one of them fails we'll at least protect

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.300 
one of them fails we'll at least protect
one<00:01:12.600> side<00:01:12.810> of<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.080> tree<00:01:13.350> hopefully<00:01:14.040> keep<00:01:14.189> the

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
one side of the tree hopefully keep the

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.690 
one side of the tree hopefully keep the
ants<00:01:14.640> maybe<00:01:14.909> at<00:01:15.119> bay<00:01:16.310> okay<00:01:17.310> go<00:01:17.400> ahead<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.610> wrap

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
ants maybe at bay okay go ahead and wrap

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.670 
ants maybe at bay okay go ahead and wrap
it<00:01:17.820> around<00:01:18.080> tape<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.380> tree<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:21.680> little

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
it around tape it to the tree a little

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.340 
it around tape it to the tree a little
higher<00:01:22.799> up<00:01:22.979> baby<00:01:23.280> little<00:01:23.580> higher

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:26.350

to<00:02:22.660> the<00:02:22.780> ants<00:02:23.049> so<00:02:23.170> far<00:02:23.440> they've<00:02:23.920> already

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
to the ants so far they've already

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:25.229 
to the ants so far they've already
getting<00:02:24.340> sticking<00:02:24.670> they<00:02:24.760> do<00:02:24.819> not<00:02:25.030> like<00:02:25.209> it

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
getting sticking they do not like it

they<00:02:25.540> seem<00:02:25.750> to<00:02:25.810> be<00:02:25.930> confused<00:02:26.560> by<00:02:26.739> it<00:02:26.799> and

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
they seem to be confused by it and

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.830 
they seem to be confused by it and
they're<00:02:27.370> trying<00:02:27.610> to<00:02:27.640> figure<00:02:27.850> how<00:02:28.000> to<00:02:28.060> get

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
they're trying to figure how to get

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.550 
they're trying to figure how to get
around<00:02:29.080> it<00:02:29.290> I<00:02:30.420> do<00:02:31.420> like<00:02:31.720> the<00:02:31.810> product<00:02:32.170> it's<00:02:32.350> a

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
around it I do like the product it's a

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.660 
around it I do like the product it's a
pretty<00:02:32.769> inexpensive<00:02:33.040> but<00:02:33.430> we'll<00:02:33.519> see<00:02:33.640> how

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
pretty inexpensive but we'll see how

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.160 
pretty inexpensive but we'll see how
long<00:02:33.790> it<00:02:34.000> lasts<00:02:34.209> once<00:02:34.450> the<00:02:34.570> rain<00:02:34.780> and<00:02:35.049> the<00:02:35.140> wind

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
long it lasts once the rain and the wind

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.740 
long it lasts once the rain and the wind
and<00:02:35.620> the<00:02:35.769> dust<00:02:36.489> and<00:02:36.670> the<00:02:36.790> pollen<00:02:37.150> hit<00:02:37.480> on<00:02:37.630> it

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
and the dust and the pollen hit on it

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.000 
and the dust and the pollen hit on it
and<00:02:37.870> stick<00:02:38.049> on<00:02:38.200> it<00:02:38.230> and<00:02:38.410> see<00:02:38.500> if<00:02:38.590> the<00:02:38.709> ants<00:02:38.829> get

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
and stick on it and see if the ants get

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.690 
and stick on it and see if the ants get
past<00:02:39.310> it

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
past it

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.130 
past it
another<00:02:40.239> option<00:02:40.540> based<00:02:40.690> on<00:02:40.810> that<00:02:40.930> I<00:02:40.989> came

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
another option based on that I came

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.870 
another option based on that I came
across<00:02:41.350> was<00:02:41.650> the<00:02:41.829> ants<00:02:42.190> do<00:02:42.310> try<00:02:42.489> to<00:02:42.519> figure<00:02:42.790> out

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
across was the ants do try to figure out

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.460 
across was the ants do try to figure out
ways<00:02:43.030> to<00:02:43.090> get<00:02:43.359> around<00:02:43.450> so<00:02:43.780> if<00:02:43.840> you<00:02:43.930> do<00:02:44.079> not<00:02:44.200> have

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
ways to get around so if you do not have

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.009 
ways to get around so if you do not have
it<00:02:44.739> perfect<00:02:45.489> they<00:02:46.269> will<00:02:46.480> try<00:02:46.690> to<00:02:46.720> get<00:02:46.900> around

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
it perfect they will try to get around

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:50.490 
it perfect they will try to get around
it<00:02:47.459> so<00:02:48.459> if<00:02:48.790> the<00:02:48.970> debris<00:02:49.299> or<00:02:49.630> other<00:02:49.660> dead<00:02:50.109> ants

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
it so if the debris or other dead ants

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.979 
it so if the debris or other dead ants
they<00:02:50.680> will<00:02:50.829> literally<00:02:51.160> find<00:02:51.489> a<00:02:51.609> trail<00:02:52.000> of<00:02:52.480> just

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
they will literally find a trail of just

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.110 
they will literally find a trail of just
the<00:02:53.140> perfect<00:02:53.380> little<00:02:53.760> rarely<00:02:54.760> where<00:02:54.880> they<00:02:54.970> can

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
the perfect little rarely where they can

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.940 
the perfect little rarely where they can
walk<00:02:55.299> to<00:02:55.480> get<00:02:55.630> it<00:02:55.750> to<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:55.900> tree<00:02:56.170> so<00:02:56.739> you<00:02:56.859> have

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
walk to get it to the tree so you have

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.560 
walk to get it to the tree so you have
to<00:02:57.040> keep<00:02:57.160> an<00:02:57.280> eye<00:02:57.459> on<00:02:57.609> this<00:02:57.760> product<00:02:58.060> to<00:02:58.420> make

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
to keep an eye on this product to make

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.930 
to keep an eye on this product to make
sure<00:02:58.720> that<00:02:58.870> there<00:02:59.109> is<00:02:59.200> no<00:02:59.410> loop<00:03:00.340> hose<00:03:00.579> for<00:03:00.850> them

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
sure that there is no loop hose for them

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.340 
sure that there is no loop hose for them
to<00:03:01.060> get<00:03:01.180> around<00:03:01.299> that's<00:03:01.720> very<00:03:01.989> similar<00:03:02.170> to

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
to get around that's very similar to

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.170 
to get around that's very similar to
caramel<00:03:02.769> flavor<00:03:03.430> like<00:03:03.609> you<00:03:03.730> put<00:03:03.880> on<00:03:03.940> your<00:03:04.000> ice

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
caramel flavor like you put on your ice

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.030 
caramel flavor like you put on your ice
cream<00:03:04.570> actually<00:03:05.140> I<00:03:05.170> think<00:03:05.260> caramel<00:03:05.650> the

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
cream actually I think caramel the

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.400 
cream actually I think caramel the
caramel<00:03:06.190> is<00:03:06.459> actually<00:03:06.730> thicker<00:03:07.390> and<00:03:08.109> stickier

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
caramel is actually thicker and stickier

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.949 
caramel is actually thicker and stickier
than<00:03:08.799> this<00:03:09.100> it<00:03:10.090> was<00:03:10.209> very<00:03:10.269> interesting<00:03:10.600> I<00:03:10.840> was

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
than this it was very interesting I was

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.740 
than this it was very interesting I was
shocked<00:03:11.140> it<00:03:11.290> wasn't<00:03:11.500> that<00:03:11.620> sticky<00:03:12.180> so<00:03:13.180> I'm

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
shocked it wasn't that sticky so I'm

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.080 
shocked it wasn't that sticky so I'm
wondering<00:03:14.019> if<00:03:14.230> air<00:03:14.500> gets<00:03:14.530> on<00:03:15.040> or<00:03:15.070> rain<00:03:15.459> will

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
wondering if air gets on or rain will

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.970 
wondering if air gets on or rain will
make<00:03:16.269> it<00:03:16.390> stick<00:03:16.660> here<00:03:16.900> or<00:03:17.019> more<00:03:17.200> tacky<00:03:17.650> if<00:03:17.829> you

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
make it stick here or more tacky if you

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:19.560 
make it stick here or more tacky if you
will<00:03:18.160> it's<00:03:18.519> not<00:03:18.579> ready<00:03:18.850> tacky<00:03:19.030> to<00:03:19.239> the<00:03:19.269> human

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
will it's not ready tacky to the human

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.620 
will it's not ready tacky to the human
skin<00:03:19.780> so<00:03:20.560> anyway<00:03:21.370> that's<00:03:21.670> just<00:03:21.790> my<00:03:21.940> my

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
skin so anyway that's just my my
