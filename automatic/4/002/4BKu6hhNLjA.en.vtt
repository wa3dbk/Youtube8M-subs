00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 hello good girls let's start 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.029
 using a pair of pants that already 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.309
 It was very good or we were broken 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.440
 to the base that we do not want to use 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.690
 we bathe while of mold that did not remain 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.670
 very wrinkled and good to measure what 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.250
 we can use another york that we have 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.170
 out there remember to put what is right the 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.750
 In the middle of what is feeling or 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.880
 paste it with a trouser tone 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.619
 let's try to accommodate it very very well for 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.019
 what more or less we are measuring the 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.910
 color the pen or a pencil selling what 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.099
 it's been far you want me 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.010
 come sun do not want it shorter 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.809
 can make shorter more according to the same 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.230
 with what is the other the other part of the 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.230
 trousers 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.570
 and then we will make good what 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.800
 would be the edges of this pants and 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.780
 what is this going to have like 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.489
 We are going to mark it, I am 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.589
 marking as four fingers that 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.530
 more or less it's like 4 centimeters and the 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:57.329
 that I do not have 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.329
 is a tape or you can use it 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.150
 Well, after that, I'll try 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:07.309
 to join the points this is not necessary 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.309
 do so for when I cut it 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.990
 and then I kiss with scissors I go to 

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:17.990
 cut it very well with two parts 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.990
 do not 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.480
 and so good for the front 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.100
 now let's re-mark what they are 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.530
 the four centimeters four fingers 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.320
 and then I'm going to mark what are two 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.549
 centimeters or two fingers because then they go 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.549
 to be two folds 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.409
 but more or less how is it going to be 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.439
 we will also do the same with the 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.439
 other 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.240
 well now I dial 1 and 2 and then good 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:58.150
 and well, join part 1 with the 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.150
 part of this way doubles it very well 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.310
 it's about developing the parts where 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:06.510
 there are the pills 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.550
 well, more or less like that 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.560
 let's raise it with a little bit to 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.710
 that more or less we are seeing how we 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.710
 goes 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.010
 what is it for? 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.000
 all right 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.470
 Y 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.600
 Y 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.570
 and after that we're going to do the 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:39.520
 second and last doubles that would be this 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.840
 he remembers more or less unfold 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.240
 well what are the parts of the 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.550
 corners where are the double hemings 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:49.140
 the very very very well since then this if 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.140
 it is already the end 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.250
 ah 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.500
 Y 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.230
 and now let's give it another light 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.780
 ironed for times as I told you 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.860
 let's see how it is going 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:19.740
 we do the same for the back 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:21.890
 from the hem if you see how you have left 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.890
 plus 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.569
 and well now with 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.579
 the parts of the foot when l 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:34.859
 with the swamp part that I'm not just going 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:34.859
 to cut it to make more or less 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:46.300
 let's find this topic 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:52.000
 we are going to soak it very well no matter 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:54.480
 that the good employer now we're going to 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.480
 iron 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.780
 and well let's see 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:04.050
 this thing that has to be posed does it for 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:04.050
 plus 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:17.220
 very good we do the same for all 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.220
 parts with the part 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.830
 now we have to make an effort that we want 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.830
 iron 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:32.689
 and well, well 

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:46.940
 with a little more 17 planets 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:46.940
 also what do you think 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:56.860
 this is going to look bad 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.860
 for the part of what are tremendous 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.310
 all right 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:29.850
 and simply missing 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.850
 but they are more or less like 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:40.110
