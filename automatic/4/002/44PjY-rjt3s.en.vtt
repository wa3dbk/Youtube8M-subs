webbings now connects with buildings and
objects<00:00:35.090> in<00:00:35.180> the<00:00:35.239> environment<00:00:35.269> rather<00:00:36.050> than

00:00:36.189 --> 00:00:36.199 
objects in the environment rather than

attaching to invisible points in midair
to<00:00:38.720> do<00:00:38.840> so<00:00:39.080> we've<00:00:39.320> mapped<00:00:39.530> both<00:00:39.860> arms<00:00:40.280> to<00:00:40.519> the

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
to do so we've mapped both arms to the

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.420 
to do so we've mapped both arms to the
left<00:00:40.850> and<00:00:41.059> right<00:00:41.120> triggers<00:00:41.809> respectively<00:00:42.430> so

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
left and right triggers respectively so

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.009 
left and right triggers respectively so
the<00:00:43.550> idea<00:00:43.670> is<00:00:43.850> simple<00:00:44.180> if<00:00:44.330> there's<00:00:44.600> a<00:00:44.659> building

00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:45.019 
the idea is simple if there's a building

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:46.990 
the idea is simple if there's a building
to<00:00:45.050> the<00:00:45.229> left<00:00:45.260> well<00:00:46.220> then<00:00:46.370> it's<00:00:46.519> better<00:00:46.699> to<00:00:46.879> use

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
to the left well then it's better to use

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.399 
to the left well then it's better to use
the<00:00:47.089> left<00:00:47.299> trigger<00:00:47.420> and<00:00:47.690> if<00:00:47.960> there's<00:00:48.140> one<00:00:48.290> to

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:48.409 
the left trigger and if there's one to

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:49.810 
the left trigger and if there's one to
the<00:00:48.500> right<00:00:48.650> then<00:00:49.159> it's<00:00:49.339> better<00:00:49.519> to<00:00:49.670> use<00:00:49.790> a

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
the right then it's better to use a

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.610 
the right then it's better to use a
retro<00:00:50.210> and<00:00:50.479> if<00:00:50.809> there's<00:00:50.960> no<00:00:51.110> building<00:00:51.290> around

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
retro and if there's no building around

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.070 
retro and if there's no building around
or<00:00:51.830> nothing<00:00:52.129> to<00:00:52.220> attach<00:00:52.489> to<00:00:52.699> well<00:00:53.030> you'll<00:00:53.809> fall

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:54.080 
or nothing to attach to well you'll fall

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.380
