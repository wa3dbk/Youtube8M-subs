see<00:01:38.130> I've<00:01:38.250> been<00:01:38.280> writing<00:01:38.640> here<00:01:39.000> so<00:01:39.510> we<00:01:39.690> noticed

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
see I've been writing here so we noticed

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.510 
see I've been writing here so we noticed
with<00:01:40.050> synaptics<00:01:40.680> pens<00:01:40.950> before<00:01:41.340> that

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
with synaptics pens before that

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.920 
with synaptics pens before that
sometimes<00:01:41.909> you<00:01:41.970> had<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.090> write<00:01:42.450> in<00:01:42.659> cursive

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930

sometimes you had to write in cursive
rather<00:01:43.380> than<00:01:43.590> print<00:01:43.860> because<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:44.430> would<00:01:44.670> miss

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
rather than print because it would miss

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.380 
rather than print because it would miss
rapid<00:01:46.020> printing<00:01:46.409> strokes<00:01:46.740> so<00:01:46.890> let's<00:01:47.070> try

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
rapid printing strokes so let's try

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.980 
rapid printing strokes so let's try
printing<00:01:50.090> it's<00:01:51.090> actually<00:01:51.600> working<00:01:51.810> pretty

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
printing it's actually working pretty

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.860 
printing it's actually working pretty
well<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.500> it's<00:01:52.650> not<00:01:52.799> missing<00:01:53.159> parts<00:01:53.549> of

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:53.870 
well and it's not missing parts of

00:01:53.870 --> 00:02:04.069 
well and it's not missing parts of
letters<00:01:54.870> or<00:01:55.020> anything<00:01:55.049> like<00:01:55.560> that

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.300 

now<00:02:05.079> you<00:02:05.170> can<00:02:05.289> see<00:02:05.409> you<00:02:05.530> missed<00:02:05.799> a<00:02:05.950> little<00:02:06.159> bit

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
now you can see you missed a little bit

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.319 
now you can see you missed a little bit
over<00:02:06.579> here<00:02:06.700> my<00:02:06.850> handwriting<00:02:07.240> is<00:02:07.299> really

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:07.329 
over here my handwriting is really

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:08.699 
over here my handwriting is really
atrocious<00:02:07.719> especially<00:02:08.289> because<00:02:08.440> I'm<00:02:08.530> writing

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
atrocious especially because I'm writing

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.259 
atrocious especially because I'm writing
this<00:02:08.890> at<00:02:09.039> a<00:02:09.099> funny<00:02:09.310> angle<00:02:09.399> right<00:02:09.910> now<00:02:10.030> so<00:02:10.179> we

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.269 
this at a funny angle right now so we

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:23.190 
this at a funny angle right now so we
can<00:02:10.450> record<00:02:10.750> this<00:02:10.989> on<00:02:11.170> video<00:02:21.599> but<00:02:22.599> overall<00:02:22.870> it

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
can record this on video but overall it

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.309 
can record this on video but overall it
works<00:02:23.530> well<00:02:23.830> not<00:02:24.250> that<00:02:24.519> at<00:02:24.730> all<00:02:24.910> so<00:02:25.840> for<00:02:26.200> those

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
works well not that at all so for those

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:28.589 
works well not that at all so for those
of<00:02:26.530> you<00:02:26.650> who<00:02:26.830> are<00:02:26.980> OneNote<00:02:27.819> types<00:02:28.150> you're

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:28.599 
of you who are OneNote types you're

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:31.229 
of you who are OneNote types you're
going<00:02:28.840> to<00:02:28.930> be<00:02:29.370> happy<00:02:30.370> with<00:02:30.549> that<00:02:30.580> and<00:02:31.030> let's

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
going to be happy with that and let's

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:33.600 
going to be happy with that and let's
take<00:02:31.599> a<00:02:31.630> quick<00:02:32.170> look<00:02:32.349> at<00:02:32.500> the<00:02:32.650> Metro<00:02:33.190> OneNote

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
take a quick look at the Metro OneNote

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:42.059 
take a quick look at the Metro OneNote
application<00:02:34.330> as<00:02:34.480> well<00:02:39.870> if<00:02:40.870> anything<00:02:41.739> this<00:02:41.890> one

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
application as well if anything this one

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:43.830 
application as well if anything this one
is<00:02:42.190> actually<00:02:42.640> keeping<00:02:42.970> up<00:02:43.150> even<00:02:43.540> a<00:02:43.599> little<00:02:43.630> bit

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
is actually keeping up even a little bit

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.259 
is actually keeping up even a little bit
better<00:02:43.989> without<00:02:44.140> losing<00:02:44.650> strokes<00:02:48.269> it's

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
better without losing strokes it's

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:50.970 
better without losing strokes it's
certainly<00:02:49.810> very<00:02:49.930> usable<00:02:50.590> and<00:02:50.650> you<00:02:50.739> can<00:02:50.890> see

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
certainly very usable and you can see

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.789 
certainly very usable and you can see
there's<00:02:51.160> even<00:02:51.310> pressure<00:02:51.519> sensitivity<00:02:52.120> here

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
there's even pressure sensitivity here

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.289 
there's even pressure sensitivity here
for<00:02:53.799> a<00:02:53.829> more<00:02:54.069> natural<00:02:54.099> writing<00:02:54.849> experience

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
for a more natural writing experience

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:57.120 
for a more natural writing experience
when<00:02:55.420> writing<00:02:55.959> lightly<00:02:56.380> it's<00:02:56.530> like<00:02:56.709> that<00:02:56.890> if<00:02:57.040> I

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
when writing lightly it's like that if I

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.580 
when writing lightly it's like that if I
press<00:02:57.370> hard<00:02:57.610> it<00:02:58.209> works<00:02:58.450> like<00:02:58.660> that<00:02:58.690> so

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
press hard it works like that so

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.650 
press hard it works like that so
definitely<00:03:00.069> a<00:03:00.130> go<00:03:00.400> for<00:03:00.670> you<00:03:00.760> note-taker<00:03:01.299> type

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
definitely a go for you note-taker type

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.420 
definitely a go for you note-taker type
so<00:03:01.810> let's<00:03:01.959> take<00:03:02.140> a<00:03:02.170> look<00:03:02.500> at<00:03:02.829> some<00:03:03.160> art

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
so let's take a look at some art

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.390 
so let's take a look at some art
programs<00:03:04.200> fresh<00:03:05.200> paint<00:03:05.500> doesn't<00:03:05.860> always<00:03:06.130> have

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
programs fresh paint doesn't always have

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.039 
programs fresh paint doesn't always have
the<00:03:06.430> best<00:03:06.940> pressure<00:03:07.269> curves<00:03:07.660> they<00:03:07.780> have<00:03:07.930> to

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.049 
the best pressure curves they have to

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.559 
the best pressure curves they have to
try<00:03:08.200> to<00:03:08.260> support<00:03:08.620> a<00:03:08.769> whole<00:03:09.040> lot<00:03:09.519> of<00:03:09.549> pens<00:03:10.209> with

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
try to support a whole lot of pens with

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:12.840 
try to support a whole lot of pens with
the<00:03:11.079> windows<00:03:11.380> ink<00:03:11.590> API<00:03:11.950> and<00:03:12.130> sometimes<00:03:12.579> they

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
the windows ink API and sometimes they

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.670 
the windows ink API and sometimes they
just<00:03:13.060> don't<00:03:13.180> get<00:03:13.359> it<00:03:13.420> right<00:03:16.230> okay<00:03:17.230> so<00:03:17.290> here<00:03:17.560> we

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
just don't get it right okay so here we

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.390 
just don't get it right okay so here we
are<00:03:17.709> in<00:03:18.010> fresh<00:03:18.459> paint<00:03:18.819> and<00:03:19.440> I<00:03:20.440> have<00:03:20.709> a<00:03:20.739> small

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
are in fresh paint and I have a small

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.289 
are in fresh paint and I have a small
black<00:03:22.440> paintbrush<00:03:23.440> a<00:03:23.709> sign<00:03:24.579> right<00:03:24.850> now<00:03:25.060> and

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
black paintbrush a sign right now and

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:29.220 
black paintbrush a sign right now and
mmm<00:03:26.970> it<00:03:27.970> takes<00:03:28.209> more<00:03:28.480> pressure<00:03:28.750> than<00:03:28.959> I<00:03:29.079> would

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
mmm it takes more pressure than I would

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.440 
mmm it takes more pressure than I would
expect<00:03:29.260> it's<00:03:29.739> not<00:03:29.889> the<00:03:30.069> worst<00:03:30.250> but<00:03:30.579> this<00:03:31.299> is

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
expect it's not the worst but this is

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:32.970 
expect it's not the worst but this is
just<00:03:31.630> in<00:03:31.840> fresh<00:03:32.109> paint<00:03:32.380> right<00:03:32.560> here<00:03:32.709> now<00:03:32.829> let's

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
just in fresh paint right here now let's

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.250 
just in fresh paint right here now let's
compare<00:03:33.250> it<00:03:33.310> to<00:03:33.430> a<00:03:33.459> finger<00:03:33.819> stroke<00:03:34.170> see<00:03:35.170> how

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
compare it to a finger stroke see how

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.490 
compare it to a finger stroke see how
much<00:03:35.380> broader<00:03:36.250> the<00:03:36.549> finger<00:03:36.819> stroke<00:03:37.060> is<00:03:37.319> so<00:03:38.319> at

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
much broader the finger stroke is so at

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.080 
much broader the finger stroke is so at
this<00:03:38.650> you<00:03:38.859> really<00:03:39.010> have<00:03:39.100> to<00:03:39.400> press<00:03:39.639> not

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
this you really have to press not

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.729 
this you really have to press not
terribly<00:03:40.690> her<00:03:40.810> totally<00:03:41.170> hard<00:03:41.350> but<00:03:41.500> you<00:03:41.590> know<00:03:41.709> a

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
terribly her totally hard but you know a

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:44.099 
terribly her totally hard but you know a
bit<00:03:42.100> more<00:03:42.400> than<00:03:42.940> we<00:03:43.120> expected<00:03:43.600> now<00:03:43.750> it's<00:03:43.900> fine

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:44.109 
bit more than we expected now it's fine

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:46.050 
bit more than we expected now it's fine
if<00:03:44.260> you<00:03:44.290> adjust<00:03:44.680> them<00:03:44.799> fresh<00:03:45.639> paint<00:03:45.880> really

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
if you adjust them fresh paint really

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.039 
if you adjust them fresh paint really
doesn't<00:03:46.299> offer<00:03:46.480> a<00:03:46.510> whole<00:03:46.750> lot<00:03:46.959> of

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
doesn't offer a whole lot of

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:48.539 
doesn't offer a whole lot of
customization<00:03:47.799> and<00:03:47.889> what<00:03:48.069> they're<00:03:48.250> doing

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:48.549 
customization and what they're doing

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:51.420 
customization and what they're doing
with<00:03:48.760> pen<00:03:49.120> pressure<00:03:49.450> sensitivity<00:03:50.049> was<00:03:50.430> so

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
with pen pressure sensitivity was so

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.949 
with pen pressure sensitivity was so
there's<00:03:51.760> that<00:03:51.970> and<00:03:53.459> now<00:03:54.459> we're<00:03:54.670> in<00:03:54.959> sketchbook

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
there's that and now we're in sketchbook

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.250 
there's that and now we're in sketchbook
nearly<00:03:56.799> a<00:03:56.829> sketchbook<00:03:57.190> and<00:03:57.609> we<00:03:58.030> are<00:03:58.329> drawing

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
nearly a sketchbook and we are drawing

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.720 
nearly a sketchbook and we are drawing
our<00:03:59.410> apple<00:03:59.680> with<00:03:59.799> the<00:03:59.829> wrong<00:04:00.069> color<00:04:00.340> right<00:04:00.579> now

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
our apple with the wrong color right now

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:02.970 
our apple with the wrong color right now
pen<00:04:01.299> pressure<00:04:01.599> is<00:04:01.810> pretty<00:04:02.049> good<00:04:02.530> on<00:04:02.650> this<00:04:02.829> now

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
pen pressure is pretty good on this now

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.740 
pen pressure is pretty good on this now
with<00:04:03.130> this<00:04:03.250> program<00:04:03.669> you<00:04:03.790> can<00:04:03.819> customize<00:04:04.599> the

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
with this program you can customize the

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.420 
with this program you can customize the
pen<00:04:04.930> pressure<00:04:05.169> so<00:04:05.500> if<00:04:05.560> it's<00:04:05.680> sensitivity<00:04:06.099> I

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
pen pressure so if it's sensitivity I

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.640 
pen pressure so if it's sensitivity I
have<00:04:06.940> a<00:04:06.970> very<00:04:07.359> light<00:04:07.750> touch<00:04:07.989> so<00:04:08.230> I<00:04:08.260> tend<00:04:08.620> to

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
have a very light touch so I tend to

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.020 
have a very light touch so I tend to
prefer<00:04:08.829> it<00:04:09.040> when<00:04:09.280> things<00:04:10.269> are<00:04:10.480> a<00:04:10.540> little<00:04:10.810> bit

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
prefer it when things are a little bit

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.309 
prefer it when things are a little bit
less<00:04:13.030> pressure<00:04:13.299> recording<00:04:13.780> this<00:04:13.870> but<00:04:14.019> this<00:04:14.140> is

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
less pressure recording this but this is

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:15.390 
less pressure recording this but this is
not<00:04:14.500> bad<00:04:14.650> at<00:04:14.769> all<00:04:14.829> so<00:04:14.890> I<00:04:15.010> can<00:04:15.099> do<00:04:15.250> pretty

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
not bad at all so I can do pretty

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.920 
not bad at all so I can do pretty
natural<00:04:15.939> pretty<00:04:16.180> quick<00:04:16.450> stroke

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
natural pretty quick stroke

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.990 
natural pretty quick stroke
now<00:04:17.410> if<00:04:17.470> we<00:04:17.560> do<00:04:17.709> the<00:04:17.859> usual<00:04:17.979> circle<00:04:18.549> test<00:04:18.820> to

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
now if we do the usual circle test to

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.659 
now if we do the usual circle test to
see<00:04:19.180> pen<00:04:19.810> latency<00:04:20.290> it's<00:04:20.799> fairly<00:04:21.160> good<00:04:21.430> not

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
see pen latency it's fairly good not

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:23.340 
see pen latency it's fairly good not

do<00:05:53.080> a<00:05:53.110> nice<00:05:53.320> sketch<00:05:53.650> with<00:05:53.889> this<00:05:54.659> pretty

00:05:55.649 --> 00:05:55.659 
do a nice sketch with this pretty

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:59.129 
do a nice sketch with this pretty
promising<00:05:57.419> so<00:05:58.419> now<00:05:58.599> we're<00:05:58.750> going<00:05:58.840> to<00:05:58.930> look<00:05:59.020> at

00:05:59.129 --> 00:05:59.139 
promising so now we're going to look at

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:01.800 
promising so now we're going to look at
Photoshop<00:05:59.860> CC<00:06:00.729> this<00:06:01.060> is<00:06:01.360> the<00:06:01.570> online

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:01.810 
Photoshop CC this is the online

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:03.990 
Photoshop CC this is the online
subscription<00:06:02.620> edition<00:06:03.039> and<00:06:03.190> I<00:06:03.669> was<00:06:03.820> testing

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.000 
subscription edition and I was testing

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.909 
subscription edition and I was testing
out<00:06:04.240> some<00:06:04.300> masking<00:06:04.990> capabilities<00:06:05.650> here<00:06:05.830> with

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:05.919 
out some masking capabilities here with

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:07.640 
out some masking capabilities here with
this<00:06:06.039> photograph<00:06:06.490> say<00:06:06.669> I<00:06:06.699> just<00:06:06.970> want<00:06:07.120> to<00:06:07.240> do<00:06:07.330> a

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:07.650 
this photograph say I just want to do a

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:12.029 
this photograph say I just want to do a
lasso<00:06:08.650> selection<00:06:10.289> something<00:06:11.289> photographers

00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:12.039 
lasso selection something photographers

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:14.760 
lasso selection something photographers
are<00:06:12.190> find<00:06:12.580> much<00:06:12.960> nicer<00:06:13.960> compared<00:06:14.349> to<00:06:14.440> using<00:06:14.710> a

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:14.770 
are find much nicer compared to using a

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:18.240 
are find much nicer compared to using a
USB<00:06:14.979> input<00:06:15.699> tablet<00:06:16.360> or<00:06:16.539> even<00:06:17.500> your<00:06:17.620> finger<00:06:18.099> for

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:18.250 
USB input tablet or even your finger for

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:21.240 
USB input tablet or even your finger for
more<00:06:18.430> precision<00:06:18.820> and<00:06:19.150> it<00:06:20.050> makes<00:06:20.260> masking<00:06:20.800> just

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:21.250 
more precision and it makes masking just

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:23.760 
more precision and it makes masking just
that<00:06:21.460> easy<00:06:21.789> so<00:06:22.150> say<00:06:22.360> I<00:06:22.419> want<00:06:22.659> to<00:06:22.870> well<00:06:23.229> create<00:06:23.710> a

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:23.770 
that easy so say I want to well create a

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:25.019 
that easy so say I want to well create a
new<00:06:23.830> adjustment<00:06:24.010> layer<00:06:24.400> or<00:06:24.610> something<00:06:24.639> that

00:06:25.019 --> 00:06:25.029 
new adjustment layer or something that

00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:26.580 
new adjustment layer or something that
I've<00:06:25.150> got<00:06:25.270> that<00:06:25.419> pretty<00:06:25.659> nicely<00:06:26.139> and<00:06:26.260> finally

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:26.590 
I've got that pretty nicely and finally

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:28.230 
I've got that pretty nicely and finally
selected<00:06:26.950> without<00:06:27.159> even<00:06:27.400> trying<00:06:27.669> very<00:06:27.909> hard

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240 
selected without even trying very hard

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.659 
selected without even trying very hard
so<00:06:28.630> obviously<00:06:28.960> that<00:06:29.050> works<00:06:29.409> pretty<00:06:29.620> well

00:06:30.659 --> 00:06:30.669 
so obviously that works pretty well

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:35.309 
so obviously that works pretty well
let's<00:06:31.180> try<00:06:31.740> drawing<00:06:32.740> because<00:06:33.069> the<00:06:34.319> latest

00:06:35.309 --> 00:06:35.319 
let's try drawing because the latest

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:37.499 
let's try drawing because the latest
version<00:06:35.680> of<00:06:35.770> Photoshop<00:06:36.159> Photoshop<00:06:36.340> CC<00:06:37.210> does

00:06:42.239 --> 00:06:42.249 
have to have wind tab drivers now give

00:06:42.249 --> 00:06:43.800 
have to have wind tab drivers now give
older<00:06:42.460> versions<00:06:42.759> of<00:06:42.879> Photoshop<00:06:43.330> you<00:06:43.360> still

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:43.810 
older versions of Photoshop you still

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:45.239 
older versions of Photoshop you still
got<00:06:43.900> any<00:06:44.020> wind<00:06:44.349> tab<00:06:44.560> drivers<00:06:44.919> which<00:06:45.039> don't

got any wind tab drivers which don't
exist<00:06:45.699> for<00:06:45.759> synaptics<00:06:46.300> but<00:06:46.449> here<00:06:46.629> we<00:06:46.719> don't

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:46.840 
exist for synaptics but here we don't

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:49.110

have<00:06:46.960> to<00:06:47.199> have<00:06:47.409> it<00:06:47.590> so<00:06:48.099> let's<00:06:48.370> switch<00:06:48.520> over<00:06:48.819> to

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:49.120 
have to have it so let's switch over to

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.529 
have to have it so let's switch over to
our<00:06:49.620> paintbrush<00:06:50.620> tool<00:06:50.889> and<00:06:51.159> this<00:06:51.969> is<00:06:52.029> I<00:06:52.330> didn't

our paintbrush tool and this is I didn't
even<00:06:52.629> have<00:06:52.719> to<00:06:52.840> change<00:06:52.990> any<00:06:53.199> settings

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:53.620 
even have to change any settings

right<00:06:56.560> there<00:06:56.770> this<00:06:57.430> is<00:06:57.610> not<00:06:57.819> bad<00:06:58.090> or<00:06:58.629> Apple<00:06:59.199> yet

00:06:59.399 --> 00:06:59.409 
right there this is not bad or Apple yet

00:06:59.409 --> 00:07:04.800 
right there this is not bad or Apple yet
again<00:07:02.849> still<00:07:03.849> I<00:07:03.879> see<00:07:04.240> it<00:07:04.330> occasionally

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:04.810 
again still I see it occasionally

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:06.600 
again still I see it occasionally
lagging<00:07:05.169> behind<00:07:05.259> on<00:07:05.620> a<00:07:05.650> stroke<00:07:06.009> here<00:07:06.279> in<00:07:06.400> there

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:06.610 
lagging behind on a stroke here in there

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:10.490 
lagging behind on a stroke here in there
it's<00:07:07.210> it's<00:07:07.599> usable<00:07:08.139> it<00:07:08.349> is<00:07:08.529> not<00:07:08.770> as<00:07:08.979> awesome<00:07:09.819> as

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:10.500 
it's it's usable it is not as awesome as

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:13.920 
it's it's usable it is not as awesome as
Wacom<00:07:11.500> or<00:07:11.710> in<00:07:11.919> trigger<00:07:12.250> becoming<00:07:12.659> it's<00:07:13.659> not

bad<00:07:14.169> on<00:07:14.319> I<00:07:14.349> can<00:07:14.620> do<00:07:14.710> a<00:07:14.740> pretty<00:07:15.069> quick<00:07:15.639> fill-in

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:16.330 
bad on I can do a pretty quick fill-in

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:18.149 
bad on I can do a pretty quick fill-in
to<00:07:16.629> create<00:07:16.840> a<00:07:16.900> shadow<00:07:17.110> under<00:07:17.469> my<00:07:17.590> Apple<00:07:18.009> there

00:07:18.149 --> 00:07:18.159 
to create a shadow under my Apple there

00:07:18.159 --> 00:07:20.189 
to create a shadow under my Apple there
but<00:07:18.340> I<00:07:18.490> go<00:07:18.789> too<00:07:18.969> fast<00:07:19.210> it'll<00:07:19.479> still<00:07:19.719> lose<00:07:19.930> some

00:07:20.189 --> 00:07:20.199 
but I go too fast it'll still lose some

00:07:20.199 --> 00:07:25.230 
but I go too fast it'll still lose some
strokes<00:07:22.919> so<00:07:23.919> there<00:07:24.159> you<00:07:24.279> have<00:07:24.310> it<00:07:24.520> there<00:07:25.000> is

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:25.240 
strokes so there you have it there is

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.719 
strokes so there you have it there is
the<00:07:25.509> HP<00:07:25.750> active<00:07:26.529> stylus<00:07:26.949> as<00:07:27.099> I<00:07:27.189> call<00:07:27.400> it<00:07:27.430> really

00:07:27.719 --> 00:07:27.729 
the HP active stylus as I call it really

00:07:27.729 --> 00:07:28.920 
the HP active stylus as I call it really
I<00:07:27.759> would<00:07:27.939> have<00:07:28.029> called<00:07:28.180> a<00:07:28.270> pen<00:07:28.479> because<00:07:28.659> this

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:28.930 
I would have called a pen because this

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:30.149 
I would have called a pen because this
is<00:07:29.050> a<00:07:29.080> digital<00:07:29.529> thing<00:07:29.710> this<00:07:29.919> is<00:07:30.129> like

00:07:30.149 --> 00:07:30.159 
is a digital thing this is like

00:07:30.159 --> 00:07:32.519 
is a digital thing this is like
capacitive<00:07:30.969> actual<00:07:31.479> has<00:07:31.689> components<00:07:32.319> and<00:07:32.439> it

00:07:32.519 --> 00:07:32.529 
capacitive actual has components and it

00:07:32.529 --> 00:07:35.909 
capacitive actual has components and it
has<00:07:32.680> a<00:07:33.189> quadruple<00:07:34.120> a<00:07:34.300> pin<00:07:34.689> inside<00:07:35.289> you<00:07:35.529> unscrew

00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:35.919 
has a quadruple a pin inside you unscrew

00:07:35.919 --> 00:07:38.399 
has a quadruple a pin inside you unscrew
the<00:07:36.099> barrel<00:07:36.250> right<00:07:36.669> here<00:07:37.000> and<00:07:37.289> probably<00:07:38.289> once

00:07:38.399 --> 00:07:38.409 
the barrel right here and probably once

00:07:38.409 --> 00:07:39.689 
the barrel right here and probably once
every<00:07:38.529> six<00:07:38.860> months<00:07:38.949> or<00:07:39.219> so<00:07:39.370> you're<00:07:39.520> going<00:07:39.639> to

00:07:39.689 --> 00:07:39.699 
every six months or so you're going to

00:07:39.699 --> 00:07:41.249 
every six months or so you're going to
replace<00:07:39.969> that<00:07:40.060> teeny<00:07:40.509> little<00:07:40.750> battery<00:07:41.139> in

00:07:41.249 --> 00:07:41.259 
replace that teeny little battery in

00:07:41.259 --> 00:07:43.379 
replace that teeny little battery in
there<00:07:41.409> but<00:07:41.589> it's<00:07:42.219> certainly<00:07:42.580> just<00:07:42.969> fine<00:07:43.210> for

00:07:43.379 --> 00:07:43.389 
there but it's certainly just fine for

00:07:43.389 --> 00:07:45.540 
there but it's certainly just fine for
note-taking<00:07:43.599> it's<00:07:44.139> decent<00:07:44.770> for<00:07:44.979> art's<00:07:45.279> still

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:45.550 
note-taking it's decent for art's still

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:48.029 
note-taking it's decent for art's still
not<00:07:45.729> quite<00:07:46.000> up<00:07:46.180> there<00:07:46.210> with<00:07:46.750> the<00:07:47.379> more

00:07:48.029 --> 00:07:48.039
