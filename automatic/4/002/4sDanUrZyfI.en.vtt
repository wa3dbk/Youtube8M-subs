00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:03.509
 So what is that?! 

00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:07.389
 The bill of the painter is 300 euros higher than the offer. 

00:00:07.389 --> 00:00:09.130
 That can not be true! 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:10.170
 No problem. 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.700
 He has discussed this with me. 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.440
 Can I see? 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:15.540
 Yes, that would have to be true. 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.980
 It would have to be right? 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:18.900
 Hmmm 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.600
 300 euros, that's not a little. 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:22.610
 What did they do? 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:27.830
 They just had to completely prime the wall and then paint it. 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.090
 That just cost more material and time. 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.010
 But you could have told me that. 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.100
 You were on a business trip and we could have just talked to each other for a short time anyway. 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.400
 I stood with the painter in front of the wall and have just decided it. 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.820
 Yes, and then you have decided it all again. 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.160
 Ha! 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.639
 What does it mean now "once again decided alone"? 

00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:50.749
 When was the last time I decided without you? 

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:53.239
 You always decide without me. 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:58.670
 You spend money, arrange meetings, without even the slightest disagree with me. 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:59.940
 That's not true at all! 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.119
 When should I have done this? 

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:02.269
 Please give me an example! 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.740
 Half a year ago you are suddenly with your best friend Sabine over the weekend 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.960
 disappeared and three weeks ago, this friendly couple stayed with us, 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.689
 everything without first talking to me. 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.840
 That with Sabine, that's half an eternity ago. 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.049
 And the Hennings, should I have left them outside the door? 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:26.469
 They had missed their train and it was bitterly cold. 

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:29.509
 But you could have asked me. 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:31.469
 Something is discussed as a couple. 

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:37.490
 I could not ask you because I did not know it myself before. 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.509
 But you could have asked me. 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.929
 Why should I have asked you, if there is only one solution anyway? 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.800
 Sure, and how I think you do not care. 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.789
 That's not true at all! 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:53.100
 I always try to involve you. 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.640
 Try just not enough. 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.640
 As you can see. 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.620
 And then is such a bill for 300 euros more expensive. 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.840
 You just do not want to understand it, right? 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.800
 But. I understand already. 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.740
 You did not even think to call me again. 

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.080
 No, not a second. 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.820
 Because I find it absolutely ridiculous. 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.620
 I guess I'm old enough to decide how to paint our wall. 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.349
 After all, she did not turn bright purple-blue with red dots. 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:27.220
 Now, be cynical again. 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.500
 So you can not talk to you at all. 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.540
 Maybe we'll talk about it in half an hour.
