00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
acquisitions because at that point I

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.540 
acquisitions because at that point I
wasn't<00:00:43.730> sure<00:00:44.149> whether<00:00:44.629> I<00:00:44.780> wanted<00:00:45.230> to<00:00:45.550> qualify

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
wasn't sure whether I wanted to qualify

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.910 
wasn't sure whether I wanted to qualify
as<00:00:46.609> a<00:00:46.820> commercial<00:00:47.179> or<00:00:47.690> a<00:00:47.719> more<00:00:48.530> civil

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
as a commercial or a more civil

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.919 
as a commercial or a more civil
practitioner<00:00:49.579> so<00:00:50.210> there<00:00:50.359> were<00:00:50.480> some<00:00:50.870> really

00:00:50.919 --> 00:00:50.929 
practitioner so there were some really

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:54.040 
practitioner so there were some really
particularly<00:00:51.679> strong<00:00:52.309> teachers<00:00:53.059> on<00:00:53.870> the

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
particularly strong teachers on the

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.139 
particularly strong teachers on the
course<00:00:54.289> and<00:00:54.649> obviously<00:00:54.979> all<00:00:55.519> the<00:00:55.729> teachers

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
course and obviously all the teachers

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:58.149 
course and obviously all the teachers
are<00:00:56.179> qualified<00:00:56.659> themselves<00:00:57.379> in<00:00:57.499> a<00:00:57.589> practice

00:00:58.149 --> 00:00:58.159 
are qualified themselves in a practice

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:01.239 
are qualified themselves in a practice
so<00:00:58.850> I<00:00:58.879> think<00:00:59.269> you<00:00:59.479> naturally<00:00:59.989> find<00:01:00.289> people<00:01:00.829> who

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:01.249 
so I think you naturally find people who

00:01:01.249 --> 00:01:05.410 
so I think you naturally find people who
you<00:01:02.199> aspire<00:01:03.199> to<00:01:03.229> be<00:01:03.589> like<00:01:03.970> it's<00:01:04.970> great<00:01:05.210> to<00:01:05.330> be
