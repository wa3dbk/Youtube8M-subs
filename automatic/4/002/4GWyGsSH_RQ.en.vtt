00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
my own little little summer project we

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.119 
my own little little summer project we
just<00:00:51.719> had<00:00:52.050> this<00:00:52.170> theory<00:00:52.469> that<00:00:52.620> we<00:00:52.890> would<00:00:53.010> have

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
just had this theory that we would have

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.380 
just had this theory that we would have
an<00:00:53.219> ice<00:00:53.340> cream<00:00:53.550> truck<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:54.059> maybe<00:00:54.180> we

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
an ice cream truck and that maybe we

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.720 
an ice cream truck and that maybe we
would<00:00:54.539> name<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.899> something<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.640> then<00:00:56.640> it

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
would name it something and then it

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.369 
would name it something and then it
became<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.090> big<00:00:57.239> gay<00:00:57.420> ice<00:00:57.449> cream<00:00:57.899> truck<00:00:58.170> and

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
became the big gay ice cream truck and

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.860 
became the big gay ice cream truck and
it<00:00:58.769> started<00:00:59.160> to<00:00:59.190> it<00:01:00.090> started<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.510> come<00:01:00.629> alive

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
it started to it started to come alive
