are<00:00:06.569> pretty<00:00:06.870> simple<00:00:07.080> once<00:00:07.350> you<00:00:07.410> figure<00:00:07.680> out

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
are pretty simple once you figure out

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:08.960 
are pretty simple once you figure out
how<00:00:07.890> to<00:00:07.950> use<00:00:08.160> them<00:00:08.370> but<00:00:08.460> there<00:00:08.610> are<00:00:08.639> some

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
how to use them but there are some

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.759 
how to use them but there are some
options<00:00:09.389> that<00:00:09.570> are<00:00:09.719> on<00:00:09.840> by<00:00:09.990> default<00:00:10.050> which<00:00:10.559> can

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
options that are on by default which can

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.589 
options that are on by default which can
really<00:00:11.219> screw<00:00:11.400> you<00:00:11.550> over<00:00:11.670> and<00:00:11.969> I've<00:00:12.300> led<00:00:12.420> a<00:00:12.450> lot

really screw you over and I've led a lot

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:13.820

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
of people having trouble with it

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.379 
of people having trouble with it
hi<00:00:14.429> trouble<00:00:14.849> with<00:00:14.940> it<00:00:15.030> when<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.240> game<00:00:15.330> first

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
hi trouble with it when the game first

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.480 
hi trouble with it when the game first
came<00:00:15.719> out<00:00:15.960> it's<00:00:16.500> very<00:00:16.740> annoying<00:00:16.980> but<00:00:17.279> it's

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
came out it's very annoying but it's

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.830 
came out it's very annoying but it's
very<00:00:17.640> simple<00:00:18.029> to<00:00:18.150> fix<00:00:18.359> now

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840

fences<00:00:19.560> are<00:00:19.640> that<00:00:20.640> I<00:00:20.880> think<00:00:21.300> they're<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.449> bit

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
fences are that I think they're a bit

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.750 
fences are that I think they're a bit
easier<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.050> use<00:00:22.199> in<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.650> sims<00:00:22.859> 4<00:00:23.130> in<00:00:23.369> some

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
easier to use in the sims 4 in some

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.340 
easier to use in the sims 4 in some
respects<00:00:24.180> once<00:00:24.390> you<00:00:24.510> figure<00:00:24.810> out<00:00:24.840> how<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.080> use

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
respects once you figure out how to use

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.580 
respects once you figure out how to use
them<00:00:25.560> for<00:00:25.740> instance<00:00:25.980> if<00:00:26.699> you<00:00:27.539> grab<00:00:28.140> this<00:00:28.380> nice

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
obviously and then you can just draw

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.090 
obviously and then you can just draw
it's<00:01:36.659> that<00:01:36.869> simple<00:01:37.049> that's<00:01:37.500> all<00:01:37.710> you<00:01:37.860> need<00:01:38.009> to

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
default but that's that's the way they

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.990 
default but that's that's the way they
decided<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:43.710> do<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.189> it<00:01:44.700> is<00:01:44.790> quite

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
decided to do it and it is quite

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.670 
decided to do it and it is quite
annoying<00:01:45.240> it's<00:01:46.049> good<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.259> do<00:01:46.350> it<00:01:46.439> here<00:01:46.560> though

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
to do that just replace everything in

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.010 
to do that just replace everything in
fences<00:02:15.940> sure<00:02:16.940> it's<00:02:17.450> useful<00:02:17.600> in<00:02:17.840> some

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
fences sure it's useful in some

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.330 
fences sure it's useful in some
instances<00:02:18.440> especially<00:02:18.590> on<00:02:18.980> these<00:02:19.100> curved

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
instances especially on these curved

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.949 
instances especially on these curved
things<00:02:19.610> because<00:02:19.910> you<00:02:20.030> can't<00:02:20.270> actually<00:02:20.720> draw

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
things because you can't actually draw

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.199 
things because you can't actually draw
curved<00:02:21.290> defenses<00:02:22.010> no<00:02:22.160> matter<00:02:22.310> how<00:02:22.880> hard<00:02:23.150> you

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
curved defenses no matter how hard you

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.800 
curved defenses no matter how hard you
try<00:02:23.690> it<00:02:23.750> doesn't<00:02:24.739> work<00:02:25.180> which<00:02:26.180> is<00:02:26.390> kind<00:02:26.780> of

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
try it doesn't work which is kind of

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.840 
try it doesn't work which is kind of
annoying<00:02:26.989> but<00:02:27.350> that<00:02:28.130> if<00:02:28.310> you<00:02:28.370> do<00:02:28.519> want<00:02:28.670> per

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
annoying but that if you do want per

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.490 
annoying but that if you do want per
fences<00:02:29.269> and<00:02:29.360> that's<00:02:29.510> how<00:02:29.600> you<00:02:29.660> do<00:02:29.780> it<00:02:29.930> use<00:02:30.380> the

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
fences and that's how you do it use the

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.080 
fences and that's how you do it use the
foundations<00:02:31.010> and<00:02:31.160> then<00:02:31.310> you<00:02:31.400> use<00:02:31.580> the<00:02:31.730> replace

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
foundations and then you use the replace

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.509 
foundations and then you use the replace
fences<00:02:32.660> tool<00:02:32.959> but<00:02:33.890> that's<00:02:34.040> just<00:02:34.130> about<00:02:34.340> it<00:02:34.459> for

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
fences tool but that's just about it for

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:37.300 
fences tool but that's just about it for
fences<00:02:34.910> it's<00:02:35.060> kind<00:02:35.239> of<00:02:35.330> simple<00:02:35.620> but<00:02:36.620> just<00:02:37.190> sort

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
fences it's kind of simple but just sort

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.560 
fences it's kind of simple but just sort
