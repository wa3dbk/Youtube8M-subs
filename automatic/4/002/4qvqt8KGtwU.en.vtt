00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:32.490
 these are to be back here as in 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.590
 my team absolutely so i look forward 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.720
 me always when i take care of her 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.160
 Of course I can see you too 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:42.540
 sometimes even if it is not so 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.480
 It's a lot of fun here 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.739
 so to be really and there I am 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.480
 actually healthy ones will occur on 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.760
 but got jerking weekend though 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.040
 otherwise I feel good and happy too 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.750
 very much on dublin say on the atmosphere 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.100
 you know those at the first 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.390
 not playing country was that 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.430
 important to you that you are so kind 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.710
 it was held back by the fc bayern 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.430
 yes, not just from the FC Bayern 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.670
 also from the federal coach has it very much 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.550
 good there not yet completely fit too 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:16.530
 get well and also get well and 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:18.990
 that was crucial for me 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.110
 thought so now and that's what I am for 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.820
 grateful and of course I'm happy now 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.200
 important is that in the club right now so 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.909
 good for the here too 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.200
 national team but that has yes 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.810
 probably also with you with ego too 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.400
 Doing with the joy of playing is the whole thing 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.360
 important that it works well in the club 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.700
 so that it will be right in the 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.940
 national team is running well it is up 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.080
 any case of advantage of course it is 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.960
 a little bit different too 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.910
 But consider it is already us advantage 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.750
 have very good players so far 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.870
 be made 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.340
 can take a lot of self-confidence 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.510
 now here too and try that 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:56.550
 Of course, then bring in here 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:58.260
 our game we can of course in 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.350
 It will be very difficult to win Ireland though 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.790
 i have full confidence in a very 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.610
 great quality here 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.590
 and if everyone stands in the square 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.629
 and also outside of it everything does 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.190
 and win the game around the two 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.720
 to win games then we can do that 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.129
 also if you manage the minds of the 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.450
 people no matter who we are against 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:17.730
 actually should actually play 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.709
 winning everything is that in principle 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.450
 expectation as you in every game 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.540
 in the quali this is not sometimes a 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.830
 a little bit over the top 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.290
 but of course different than you can 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.330
 say it is the success because because 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.140
 because he had the whole games 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.650
 we won 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.480
 and now you take that as 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.400
 course on that one time there 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.340
 win and win for us 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.290
 player is of course it always works 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.240
 from the first minute on it is 0 0 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.770
 and you have to first the opponent 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.750
 also to lie down so even then the gates 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.330
 to do that work is always 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.890
 behind it 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.410
 in opinion if the opponents not smaller 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:59.720
 but the size and we have to 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:02.520
 also get bigger and we try 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.630
 now again to show the art and 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:07.850
 Wise as we want to play we want 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:11.040
 down only win a game but also 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.840
 gain superior and I hope we 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.910
 can do it though in now 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.410
 Ireland, of course, no one on our future 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.930
 the militant heart hand the 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:22.230
 the spectator is passionate 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:26.790
 in the back has of course and coach has 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:28.769
 the shrewd one ask again for 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.900
 you need professional preparation 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.519
 because always the ball of the opponent because 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.230
 again and again with all other balls 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:39.150
 is heard that also yes 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:43.860
 Absolutely I think the balls are 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:46.200
 different of course is unfamiliar 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.269
 It's an advantage that we have the balls now 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.150
 already have how he behaves 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:52.260
 Trajectory at passes as he jumps 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.640
 There are already differences to recognize 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.760
 Finally, a question you are looking forward to 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.739
 on trapattoni yes I have 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:03.090
 Not experienced as a coach but I have 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:04.769
 often seen him on the street SÃ¤bener 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.569
 So here have played a youth and 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:11.129
 I was still a story of him 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:12.659
 by ex players or on one 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:14.519
 Physiotherapist who experienced him then 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:16.500
 and they all said that one 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:19.970
 great guy so therefore I am pleased 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.970
 a bit on super thank you
