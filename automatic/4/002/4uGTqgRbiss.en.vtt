can see they have their first set of

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.059 
can see they have their first set of
true<00:03:42.180> leaves<00:03:42.389> a<00:03:42.810> couple<00:03:43.560> of<00:03:43.620> things<00:03:43.799> that<00:03:43.859> were

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
true leaves a couple of things that were

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:47.330 
true leaves a couple of things that were
we<00:03:44.190> growing<00:03:44.430> some<00:03:45.120> bok<00:03:45.299> choy<00:03:45.889> onto<00:03:46.889> their<00:03:47.040> left

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
we growing some bok choy onto their left

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.629 
we growing some bok choy onto their left
and<00:03:47.549> napa<00:03:48.180> cabbage<00:03:49.040> and<00:03:50.040> this<00:03:50.190> was<00:03:50.400> another

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:50.639 
and napa cabbage and this was another

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:53.390 
and napa cabbage and this was another
bok<00:03:51.359> choy<00:03:51.599> that<00:03:51.840> we<00:03:52.019> regrowth<00:03:52.440> is<00:03:52.829> a<00:03:52.859> baby<00:03:53.160> bok

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
bok choy that we regrowth is a baby bok

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.580 
bok choy that we regrowth is a baby bok
choy<00:03:53.700> and<00:03:54.060> it's<00:03:54.840> almost<00:03:55.200> ready<00:03:55.380> to<00:03:55.470> be

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
choy and it's almost ready to be

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.470 
choy and it's almost ready to be
harvested<00:03:55.799> again<00:03:56.400> so<00:03:56.760> this<00:03:56.910> is<00:03:57.030> really<00:03:57.299> easy

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
harvested again so this is really easy

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.970 
harvested again so this is really easy
to<00:03:57.599> do<00:03:57.780> just<00:03:58.139> like<00:03:58.260> the<00:03:58.410> video<00:03:58.650> I<00:03:58.709> did<00:03:58.950> on

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
to do just like the video I did on

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.460 
to do just like the video I did on
regrowing<00:03:59.760> romaine<00:04:00.269> lettuce<00:04:00.419> was<00:04:01.290> the

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
regrowing romaine lettuce was the

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.890 
regrowing romaine lettuce was the
lettuce<00:04:01.980> that<00:04:02.010> we<00:04:02.280> were<00:04:02.430> growing<00:04:02.790> except<00:04:03.629> the

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
lettuce that we were growing except the

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.050 
lettuce that we were growing except the
kids<00:04:04.169> started<00:04:04.680> eating<00:04:04.829> the<00:04:05.129> leaves<00:04:05.250> so<00:04:05.790> I

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
kids started eating the leaves so I

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:07.849 
kids started eating the leaves so I
think<00:04:06.599> it's<00:04:06.810> pretty<00:04:06.989> much<00:04:07.049> done<00:04:07.410> they've<00:04:07.739> been

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:07.859 
think it's pretty much done they've been

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:09.770 
think it's pretty much done they've been
kind<00:04:08.010> of<00:04:08.129> snacking<00:04:08.549> on<00:04:08.639> it<00:04:08.849> but<00:04:09.209> it<00:04:09.329> did<00:04:09.480> pretty

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
kind of snacking on it but it did pretty

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.319 
kind of snacking on it but it did pretty
well<00:04:09.900> for<00:04:10.349> the<00:04:10.680> time<00:04:10.859> being<00:04:11.129> this<00:04:11.639> one<00:04:11.849> here<00:04:12.120> is

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
well for the time being this one here is

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:15.110 
well for the time being this one here is
the<00:04:12.359> ginger<00:04:12.959> plant<00:04:13.410> that<00:04:14.010> we<00:04:14.190> planted<00:04:14.730> a<00:04:14.940> few

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
the ginger plant that we planted a few

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.599 
the ginger plant that we planted a few
months<00:04:15.419> back<00:04:15.599> it's<00:04:16.139> doing<00:04:16.410> really<00:04:16.680> well<00:04:16.979> it's

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
months back it's doing really well it's

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.300 
months back it's doing really well it's
about<00:04:17.699> a<00:04:18.180> foot<00:04:18.359> and<00:04:18.449> a<00:04:18.510> half<00:04:18.599> tall<00:04:18.900> now<00:04:19.310> they're

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
about a foot and a half tall now they're

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.420 
about a foot and a half tall now they're
more<00:04:20.489> ginger<00:04:21.030> that<00:04:21.660> we<00:04:21.979> planted<00:04:22.979> I<00:04:23.219> think

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
more ginger that we planted I think

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.149 
more ginger that we planted I think
about<00:04:23.610> two<00:04:23.820> months<00:04:24.060> ago<00:04:24.180> so<00:04:24.719> it's<00:04:25.169> sprouting

00:04:26.149 --> 00:04:26.159 
about two months ago so it's sprouting

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:27.140 
about two months ago so it's sprouting
as<00:04:26.280> well

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
as well

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.750 
as well
more<00:04:27.570> herbs<00:04:27.960> they're<00:04:28.830> doing<00:04:29.310> much<00:04:29.490> better

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
more herbs they're doing much better

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.960 
more herbs they're doing much better
than<00:04:29.910> before<00:04:30.380> this<00:04:31.380> is<00:04:31.650> the<00:04:31.680> sweet<00:04:32.610> Italian

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970

like they're much better there were

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.770 
like they're much better there were
leggy<00:04:47.070> at<00:04:47.280> the<00:04:47.400> beginning<00:04:47.880> because<00:04:48.180> they<00:04:48.510> put

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
leggy at the beginning because they put

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:49.820 
leggy at the beginning because they put
them<00:04:48.870> close<00:04:49.050> enough<00:04:49.080> sort<00:04:49.470> of<00:04:49.530> light<00:04:49.680> when

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
them close enough sort of light when

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.890 
them close enough sort of light when
there<00:04:49.949> were<00:04:50.040> seedlings<00:04:50.490> and<00:04:51.330> this<00:04:51.510> pot<00:04:51.720> here

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
there were seedlings and this pot here

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.879 
there were seedlings and this pot here
is<00:04:52.050> a<00:04:52.080> combination<00:04:52.740> of<00:04:52.830> cilantro<00:04:53.570> basil<00:04:54.570> and<00:04:55.410> I

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:55.889 
is a combination of cilantro basil and I

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:58.240 
is a combination of cilantro basil and I
believe<00:04:56.400> there's<00:04:56.729> some<00:04:56.940> oregano<00:04:57.330> in<00:04:57.750> there

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
believe there's some oregano in there

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.370 
believe there's some oregano in there
towards<00:04:59.250> the<00:04:59.340> bottom<00:04:59.610> kind<00:05:00.600> of<00:05:00.720> hopes<00:05:01.020> being

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
towards the bottom kind of hopes being

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.810 
towards the bottom kind of hopes being
shaded<00:05:01.650> a<00:05:01.830> better<00:05:02.180> than<00:05:03.180> these<00:05:03.389> out<00:05:04.430> these<00:05:05.430> are

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
shaded a better than these out these are

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.510 
shaded a better than these out these are
the<00:05:05.850> sensitive<00:05:06.539> plans<00:05:06.930> or<00:05:07.380> mimosa<00:05:07.740> pudica

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
the sensitive plans or mimosa pudica

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.689 
the sensitive plans or mimosa pudica
they<00:05:09.360> are<00:05:09.660> getting<00:05:10.080> really<00:05:10.320> big<00:05:10.590> so<00:05:11.280> these<00:05:11.550> are

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:11.699 
they are getting really big so these are

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:17.090 
they are getting really big so these are
