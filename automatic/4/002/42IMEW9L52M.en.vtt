residue and obviously since I got the

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.859 
residue and obviously since I got the
contacts<00:01:47.610> facing<00:01:47.729> down<00:01:48.180> there's<00:01:48.540> nothing

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
contacts facing down there's nothing

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
touching the contacts of the SD cards

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.819 
touching the contacts of the SD cards
which<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.149> should<00:01:51.329> never<00:01:51.479> touch<00:01:51.829> most

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
which you should never touch most

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.920 
which you should never touch most
especially<00:01:53.250> not<00:01:53.640> have<00:01:53.820> sticky<00:01:54.210> residue<00:01:54.600> on

especially not have sticky residue on
but<00:01:57.170> simplex<00:01:58.170> tape<00:01:58.710> like<00:01:58.950> this<00:01:59.360> doesn't<00:02:00.360> more

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
but simplex tape like this doesn't more

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.230 
but simplex tape like this doesn't more
the<00:02:01.350> finish<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.159> sticker<00:02:02.399> of<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.670> SD<00:02:02.969> card

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
the finish of the sticker of the SD card

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.940 
the finish of the sticker of the SD card
and<00:02:03.450> it<00:02:03.600> doesn't<00:02:03.899> leave<00:02:04.020> sticky<00:02:04.439> residue

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
and it doesn't leave sticky residue

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.670 
and it doesn't leave sticky residue
nor<00:02:05.759> is<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:05.909> on<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.270> contact<00:02:06.780> so<00:02:07.110> removing

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
nor is it on the contact so removing

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.559 
nor is it on the contact so removing
this<00:02:07.829> is<00:02:08.039> really<00:02:08.280> easy<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:08.759> swapping<00:02:09.000> out<00:02:09.209> SD

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
this is really easy and swapping out SD
