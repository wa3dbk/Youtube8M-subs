00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
previous video with the Crimson Dynamo I

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.770 
previous video with the Crimson Dynamo I
was<00:02:50.430> wondering<00:02:50.910> if<00:02:51.030> you<00:02:51.120> could<00:02:51.269> actually<00:02:51.450> mix

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
was wondering if you could actually mix

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.990 
was wondering if you could actually mix
and<00:02:51.989> match<00:02:52.170> these<00:02:52.440> cards<00:02:52.890> and<00:02:53.129> in<00:02:53.489> fact<00:02:53.730> you

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
and match these cards and in fact you

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.100 
and match these cards and in fact you
can<00:02:54.769> let<00:02:55.769> me<00:02:55.800> get<00:02:56.250> a<00:02:56.280> Crimson<00:02:56.910> Dynamo<00:02:57.110> card

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
can let me get a Crimson Dynamo card

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.410 
can let me get a Crimson Dynamo card
here<00:02:59.090> and<00:03:00.090> as<00:03:00.659> you<00:03:00.780> can<00:03:00.900> see<00:03:01.519> the<00:03:02.519> position<00:03:03.239> of

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
here and as you can see the position of

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.420 
here and as you can see the position of
the<00:03:03.510> figure<00:03:03.930> on<00:03:04.110> the<00:03:04.140> cards<00:03:04.650> of<00:03:04.739> standard<00:03:05.280> so

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
the figure on the cards of standard so

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.970 
the figure on the cards of standard so
you<00:03:05.489> can<00:03:05.790> indeed<00:03:06.120> mix<00:03:06.450> and<00:03:06.629> match<00:03:06.840> and<00:03:07.200> what's

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
you can indeed mix and match and what's

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.220 
you can indeed mix and match and what's
interesting<00:03:08.220> also<00:03:08.640> is<00:03:08.909> that<00:03:09.090> because<00:03:09.959> the

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
interesting also is that because the

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.649 
interesting also is that because the
each<00:03:10.379> of<00:03:10.409> the<00:03:10.680> cards<00:03:11.159> has<00:03:11.940> a<00:03:12.000> portion<00:03:12.450> of<00:03:12.540> the

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:12.659 
each of the cards has a portion of the

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:15.619 
each of the cards has a portion of the
code<00:03:13.019> if<00:03:13.530> you<00:03:13.980> mix<00:03:14.340> and<00:03:14.519> match<00:03:14.580> you<00:03:15.150> get<00:03:15.300> brand

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:15.629 
code if you mix and match you get brand

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:19.970 
code if you mix and match you get brand
new<00:03:15.840> code<00:03:16.140> on<00:03:16.470> there<00:03:17.629> so<00:03:18.629> when<00:03:19.080> the<00:03:19.769> website

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
new code on there so when the website

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.910 
new code on there so when the website
comes<00:03:20.430> up<00:03:20.580> I'm<00:03:21.260> hoping<00:03:22.260> to<00:03:23.300> see<00:03:24.300> a<00:03:24.569> pretty<00:03:25.260> neat

stuff<00:03:26.220> on<00:03:26.430> there<00:03:26.670> that<00:03:27.060> you<00:03:27.090> can<00:03:27.330> do<00:03:28.280> second

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
stuff on there that you can do second

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.089

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:43.640 
now for a figure that's pretty bulky I

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.360 
now for a figure that's pretty bulky I
was<00:04:44.210> never<00:04:45.110> expecting<00:04:45.740> much<00:04:45.980> articulation

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
was never expecting much articulation

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.140 
was never expecting much articulation
and<00:04:47.330> and<00:04:47.990> it's<00:04:48.200> true<00:04:48.560> with<00:04:48.740> this<00:04:48.920> figure<00:04:49.150> and

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.150 
and and it's true with this figure and

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.950 
and and it's true with this figure and
on<00:04:50.630> this<00:04:51.010> ahead<00:04:52.010> it<00:04:52.880> actually<00:04:53.240> goes<00:04:53.480> back<00:04:53.660> and

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
on this ahead it actually goes back and

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.220 
on this ahead it actually goes back and
forth<00:04:54.020> a<00:04:54.500> little<00:04:54.890> bit<00:04:55.480> not<00:04:56.480> too<00:04:56.720> much<00:04:56.750> up<00:04:57.110> and

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:57.230 
forth a little bit not too much up and

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:02.100

the<00:05:07.490> elbows<00:05:07.940> we<00:05:08.480> Bend<00:05:09.520> and<00:05:10.520> then<00:05:11.090> go<00:05:11.240> all<00:05:11.420> the

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 
the elbows we Bend and then go all the

the elbows we Bend and then go all the
way<00:05:11.600> around<00:05:13.090> it<00:05:14.090> and<00:05:14.530> there's<00:05:15.530> no<00:05:15.920> wrist

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340

way around it and there's no wrist
articulation<00:05:16.550> at<00:05:17.330> all<00:05:17.620> they're<00:05:18.910> actually<00:05:19.910> a

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:19.940 
articulation at all they're actually a

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.660 
articulation at all they're actually a
part<00:05:20.000> of<00:05:20.450> the<00:05:20.540> forearm

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:21.670 
part of the forearm

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:24.970 
part of the forearm
there's<00:05:22.670> no<00:05:22.820> torso<00:05:23.750> articulation<00:05:24.470> as<00:05:24.770> well

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:24.980 
there's no torso articulation as well

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:28.570 
there's no torso articulation as well
but<00:05:25.880> does<00:05:26.150> have<00:05:26.360> waist<00:05:26.750> articulation<00:05:26.980> all<00:05:27.980> the

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.580 
but does have waist articulation all the

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:35.140 
but does have waist articulation all the
way<00:05:28.700> around<00:05:30.970> B<00:05:31.970> legs<00:05:33.550> barely<00:05:34.550> go<00:05:34.700> up<00:05:34.880> and<00:05:35.060> down

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.150 
way around B legs barely go up and down

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:42.520 
way around B legs barely go up and down
at<00:05:35.390> all<00:05:36.040> but<00:05:37.040> does<00:05:38.620> swivel<00:05:39.620> at<00:05:40.070> the<00:05:40.610> hip<00:05:41.530> the

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:42.530 
at all but does swivel at the hip the

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:50.350 
at all but does swivel at the hip the
knees<00:05:43.210> do<00:05:44.210> not<00:05:45.400> go<00:05:46.400> up<00:05:46.550> and<00:05:46.700> down<00:05:47.320> too<00:05:48.320> much<00:05:49.360> but

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:50.360 
knees do not go up and down too much but

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:53.680 
knees do not go up and down too much but
it<00:05:50.510> does<00:05:50.720> rotate<00:05:51.670> around<00:05:52.670> the<00:05:53.120> knees<00:05:53.300> as<00:05:53.540> well

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:53.690 
it does rotate around the knees as well

00:05:53.690 --> 00:06:01.120 
it does rotate around the knees as well
and<00:05:54.790> it<00:05:55.790> does<00:05:56.060> rotate<00:05:56.600> at<00:05:56.930> the<00:05:57.080> feet<00:05:57.580> so<00:06:00.130> that's

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:01.130 
and it does rotate at the feet so that's

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:05.350 
and it does rotate at the feet so that's
pretty<00:06:01.340> much<00:06:01.430> it<00:06:01.550> for<00:06:01.970> the<00:06:02.390> Iron<00:06:02.930> Man<00:06:03.260> mark<00:06:03.620> 1<00:06:04.360> I

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:05.360 
pretty much it for the Iron Man mark 1 I

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.880 
pretty much it for the Iron Man mark 1 I
highly<00:06:06.110> recommend<00:06:06.650> this<00:06:06.890> figure<00:06:08.350> if<00:06:09.350> you're<00:06:09.860> a

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:09.890 
highly recommend this figure if you're a

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:15.780 
highly recommend this figure if you're a
fan<00:06:10.250> of<00:06:10.280> the<00:06:10.580> movie<00:06:10.820> mark<00:06:11.570> 1<00:06:12.520> Iron<00:06:13.520> Man

fan of the movie mark 1 Iron Man
I<00:06:15.820> actually<00:06:16.030> just<00:06:16.330> recommended<00:06:16.870> for<00:06:17.020> the

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:17.140 
I actually just recommended for the

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:19.410 
I actually just recommended for the
detail<00:06:17.530> alone<00:06:18.280> I<00:06:18.310> think<00:06:18.670> it's<00:06:18.820> well<00:06:19.390> worth

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:19.420 
detail alone I think it's well worth

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:23.130 
detail alone I think it's well worth
