 he brings 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:20.160
 At the end play completely locked today 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.160

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:25.630
 the oldest advertising 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:28.270
 mecklenburg western pomerania is finally doing 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.460
 again the foil-paper-the middle ages 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.379
 The castle nobility can, like so many others 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.100
 the spectacle of the castle festival barely 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:36.129
 expect 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.809
 They try a few days before the 22nd 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:39.900
 Burgfest a look at its 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:42.250
 preparations to catch 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.260
 350 vikings have this time 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.500
 announced from russia norway

 France and many other countries 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.330
 The Bradl is also a busy destination in the fore 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.940
 will soon be his representative tasks 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:57.670
 perceive 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:01.089
 ennobled dancing for the people sometimes with 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.220
 the people yes and otherwise the dealers 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:06.340
 are controlled as it is in the 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.950
 In the Middle Ages it was going to be a market rate 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:14.310
 raised and this market rate will also 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:18.220
 on sunday from cheap with his 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:22.780
 called on the guests that's all too 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:25.090
 see at the castle festival Unterburg Adel 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.460
 will also be the little knights and 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.670
 Missed the over the weekend 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.859
 then take exams then become 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.890
 be killed and demanded the castle 

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:39.539
 we castle courtyard in front of the blackboard that 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.539
 it ever so our tasks with 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.140
 in front of the castle is clearly the vikings are 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.549
 not so far away but also in 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.680
 the time back 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:50.570
 punctually at the beginning of the festival will hardly 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.970
 something else to our hectic 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.039
 technical time remember that 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.110
 However, it is not the age that holds the Middle Ages 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:59.570
 often wrong version of it like that 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.250
 some film represents the participants 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.200
 the football battles especially the 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.539
 to have German fighters of insight 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.720
 to historical authenticity 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:09.560
 prescribed 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:13.420
 Philip RÃ¶sskopf is overseen by archaeologist 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.420
 and expert for the early Middle Ages 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:20.540
 from archaeological site very 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.870
 interesting if you for example 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.849
 Dig yourself things found here 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.760
 Northeastern Germany can be found then yes 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:30.769
 relatively much from the Slavic period to the 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.330
 Part of the same goes with the Viking era 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:34.220
 and of course they have 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.230
 certain Scandinavian import and such 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.890
 and for example on one side 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:42.140
 So we have replicated jewelry 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.420
 here, for example, such a ring 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.780
 a bracelet or as you can see here 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.160
 so as a mature and stuff 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.829
 and that is very exciting when you are 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.680
 accordingly as archaeological 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:57.280
 found fundstÃ¼ck and next notes 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.870
 that it really looks exactly like that and 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.549
 then you have that connection again 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.910
 has to be if you are serious 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:08.239
 think about the race, what do I want 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.889
 represent because the entire ensemble what 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.209
 One should of course wear each other 

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:13.069
 So I can fit somehow 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:15.859
 clothes new century jewelry 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:18.290
 twelfth century and sword early 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:21.019
 neuzeit wearing it clear that 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.170
 you have to think about some people 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:26.750
 then just synonymous so scene nickname 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.430
 some not that one can hold as one 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.140
 would like to 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.900
 and then that was it and then 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:35.959
 you sit together with the people who 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.569
 one has years or one learns new people 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:42.190
 know one exchanges one manufactures 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:42.190
 things are going to fight 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:48.709
 a not entirely insignificant detail is 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.820
 Also a real eat the children than that 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:51.320
 castle still a little 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.990
 meet some fencing 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:56.060
 Enthusiasts were very killing takeovers 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:59.120
 the food of the always hungry 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.010
 at some point, it became too many for her 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.140
 hungry mouths and now she cooks 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.510
 exclusively her clan the amber 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:08.090
 bring as it cook in the open nature 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:12.080
 is nothing to replace for them 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:14.780
 I like to cook and so has that 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.480
 developed and eventually I have 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.769
 the cookbook written 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.510
 with all the recipes we are so on 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.580
 so have tried the markets 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:25.790
 is always everything really 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.530
 tested that the market is what 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:32.720
 means as much as it can be with 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:34.970
 Relatively few ingredients from the time and 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:38.360
 also modified for cooking on the market 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:40.460
 on open fire which is not always so 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.860
 There are also many many recipes that 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:45.290
 one finds so where then always is yes 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.450
 Preheat oven to 220 degrees yes that 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:48.830
 Do not go here you have to 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:52.330
 all in a pot or in a pan 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.330
 or just on the grill 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:59.590
 in the oskar battle will be 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.870
 Hundreds of vikings 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.640
 standing opposite and theirs 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.470
 let's talk what weapons 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.890
 There are comparable things in Germany 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.650
 Not 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:10.660
 the pattern decides the participation 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.550
 May the historical inaccuracy 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.740
 Certified is allowed to get nothing is yes 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.420
 so do not come back and the 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.680
 safety regulations must hurt 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:20.860
 not compete at all 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:22.690
 this is strictly upheld by everyone 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.040
 here knows and respects the 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:28.610
 experienced fencing more 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:30.740
 because before that fought right today 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.790
 at looked whether in the situation are the 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.490
 to perform at all 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:35.570
 this one has already been managed 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.850
 hard because the whole body as 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:39.710
 is hit area and if we are the 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:40.880
 opinion are that far enough 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:42.110
 You can fight in the big battle 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.120
 participate then get treated safely 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:46.520
 you can do it tomorrow or on saturday and 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:48.740
 sunday join in violations are just 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.140
 if you do not have the right weapons 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.420
 So it has sharp weapon use 

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:55.370
 do such things 

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:56.690
 and if the hits are not accepted 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:58.520
 become that and therefore we understand 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.660
 us so nothing is agreed 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.870
 all free fighting that is 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.870
 Of course 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.650
 We share the groups in the 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:10.610
 apron and then you 're on it 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:11.690
 that it is reasonably balanced in the castle 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.910
 Nobility is far away 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:16.010
 here on the fightground and therefore also 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:18.070
 the some participants to clean something 

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:20.650
 convey a romantic idea 

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:23.270
 the times as the oldest advertising 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:25.450
 Kinofans fend off real attackers 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:28.010
 had to become more and more alive 

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:30.140
 ironically, of all things bothers 

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:32.450
 castle itself the authentic time travel 

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:34.100
 a little while the fighting vikings 

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:36.140
 namely from the nine to twelve 

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:38.450
 Century came the first genuine 

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:41.180
 fight here only about 200 years later 

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:43.430
 was probably the most beautiful medieval festival 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:46.090
 Northern Germany expresses this detail in 

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.090
 no way
