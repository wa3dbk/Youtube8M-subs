00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.010 
but all the work all the engine work and

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.370 
but all the work all the engine work and
everything<00:01:55.430> was<00:01:55.670> right<00:01:55.940> here<00:01:56.120> in<00:01:56.150> California

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
everything was right here in California

everything was right here in California
no<00:01:57.380> no<00:01:57.560> this<00:01:57.830> now<00:01:57.950> is<00:01:58.100> came<00:01:58.280> both<00:01:58.820> these<00:01:59.000> cars

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
no no this now is came both these cars

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.180 
no no this now is came both these cars
come<00:01:59.479> straight<00:01:59.720> from<00:01:59.810> Japan<00:01:59.960> Hortonville<00:02:00.650> we

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
come straight from Japan Hortonville we

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.340 
come straight from Japan Hortonville we
just<00:02:01.400> do<00:02:01.550> maintenance<00:02:02.060> depend<00:02:03.020> on<00:02:03.140> whatever

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
just do maintenance depend on whatever

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.640 
just do maintenance depend on whatever
improvements<00:02:04.130> we<00:02:04.220> need<00:02:04.369> to<00:02:04.460> do<00:02:04.610> here<00:02:05.500> to<00:02:06.500> make

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
improvements we need to do here to make

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.190 
improvements we need to do here to make
them<00:02:06.800> appropriate<00:02:07.040> for<00:02:07.640> our<00:02:08.119> tracks<00:02:08.479> for

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
them appropriate for our tracks for

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.719 
them appropriate for our tracks for
example<00:02:09.619> we<00:02:09.709> got<00:02:09.800> to<00:02:09.950> change<00:02:10.070> the<00:02:10.250> final<00:02:10.459> tear

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
example we got to change the final tear

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.730 
example we got to change the final tear
on<00:02:10.850> this<00:02:11.030> because<00:02:11.840> it's<00:02:12.050> designed<00:02:12.200> for<00:02:12.440> a<00:02:12.590> much

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
on this because it's designed for a much

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.199 
on this because it's designed for a much
shorter<00:02:12.920> circuit<00:02:13.430> our<00:02:14.420> courses<00:02:14.870> are

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
shorter circuit our courses are

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:19.770 
shorter circuit our courses are
so<00:02:16.750> that's<00:02:16.930> some<00:02:17.079> people<00:02:17.349> through<00:02:17.530> here<00:02:18.780> for

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
so that's some people through here for

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.250 
so that's some people through here for
the<00:02:19.870> cars<00:02:20.109> these<00:02:20.890> cars<00:02:21.280> these<00:02:21.730> two<00:02:21.969> came

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
the cars these cars these two came

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:35.890 
the cars these cars these two came
bill<00:02:23.860> farm<00:02:24.189> spoon<00:02:24.640> okay

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.960 

yeah<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.260> insides<00:02:37.800> are<00:02:38.340> completely

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
yeah the insides are completely

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.600 
yeah the insides are completely
different<00:02:39.150> between<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:39.750> two<00:02:40.010> when<00:02:41.010> you<00:02:41.130> you

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
different between the two when you you

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.970 
different between the two when you you
can<00:02:41.790> definitely<00:02:42.210> have<00:02:42.420> you<00:02:43.410> definitely<00:02:43.440> tell

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
can definitely have you definitely tell

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.620 
can definitely have you definitely tell
that<00:02:44.130> there<00:02:44.340> are<00:02:44.460> two<00:02:44.880> different<00:02:45.060> purposes

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
that there are two different purposes

00:02:45.630 --> 00:03:03.420 
that there are two different purposes
for<00:02:45.690> sure<00:02:46.050> a<00:02:49.040> couple<00:02:50.040> skills

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.640 

so<00:03:04.030> it's<00:03:04.329> a<00:03:04.709> k20<00:03:05.709> turbo<00:03:06.000> charge<00:03:07.650> 430

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
so it's a k20 turbo charge 430

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.630 
so it's a k20 turbo charge 430
horsepower<00:03:09.010> to<00:03:09.519> the<00:03:09.610> wheel

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.979 

and<00:03:13.640> this<00:03:13.790> engine<00:03:14.000> was<00:03:14.209> built<00:03:14.390> for<00:03:14.720> Time

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
and this engine was built for Time

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:19.309 
and this engine was built for Time
Attack<00:03:15.110> yes<00:03:15.680> Lizabeth<00:03:16.159> for<00:03:16.430> time<00:03:16.580> to<00:03:16.670> time

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:23.330 

and<00:03:19.409> where<00:03:20.129> his<00:03:20.280> is<00:03:20.459> raced<00:03:20.760> I<00:03:22.129> Joseph<00:03:23.129> here<00:03:23.249> in

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
and where his is raced I Joseph here in

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.399 
and where his is raced I Joseph here in
the<00:03:23.430> US<00:03:23.670> or<00:03:23.819> has<00:03:23.939> been<00:03:24.120> outside<00:03:24.450> no<00:03:24.989> the<00:03:25.200> car

the US or has been outside no the car
came<00:03:25.590> from<00:03:25.739> Japan<00:03:26.510> Japan<00:03:29.540> hold

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.390 

the<00:03:33.820> circuit<00:03:34.210> in<00:03:34.390> Japan<00:03:34.780> and<00:03:35.470> then<00:03:35.740> after<00:03:36.370> I

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
the circuit in Japan and then after I

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.000 
the circuit in Japan and then after I
did<00:03:36.610> that<00:03:36.640> it<00:03:37.570> was<00:03:37.720> a<00:03:37.810> rebuilt<00:03:38.350> by<00:03:38.440> spoon<00:03:38.740> and

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
did that it was a rebuilt by spoon and

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.760 
did that it was a rebuilt by spoon and
set<00:03:39.670> here<00:03:40.120> for<00:03:40.300> us<00:03:40.600> to<00:03:40.960> do<00:03:41.080> Time<00:03:41.290> Attack<00:03:41.440> in<00:03:41.710> the
