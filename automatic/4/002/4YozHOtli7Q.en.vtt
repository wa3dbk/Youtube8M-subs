00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
also a case series processors so you

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.229 
also a case series processors so you
could<00:00:31.230> overclock<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:32.099> for<00:00:32.700> our<00:00:32.820> budget

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
could overclock it and for our budget

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.120 
could overclock it and for our budget
this<00:00:33.480> is<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.750> best<00:00:33.930> option<00:00:34.170> we<00:00:34.440> have<00:00:34.710> for<00:00:35.070> the

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
this is the best option we have for the

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.290 
this is the best option we have for the
motherboard<00:00:35.579> I<00:00:35.730> choose<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.239> MSI<00:00:36.840> z97<00:00:37.739> mg<00:00:38.610> 43

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
motherboard I choose the MSI z97 mg 43

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.869 
motherboard I choose the MSI z97 mg 43
this<00:00:39.719> is<00:00:39.870> an<00:00:40.020> LGA<00:00:40.379> 1150<00:00:40.950> motherboard<00:00:41.129> so<00:00:41.700> it

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
this is an LGA 1150 motherboard so it

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.510 
this is an LGA 1150 motherboard so it
supports<00:00:42.059> our<00:00:42.390> CPU<00:00:42.870> it<00:00:43.050> has<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.410> z97<00:00:43.890> chipset

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
supports our CPU it has the z97 chipset

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.940 
supports our CPU it has the z97 chipset
so<00:00:44.670> you<00:00:44.730> could<00:00:44.910> overclock<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.390> i5<00:00:45.899> 4690<00:00:46.770> you

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
so you could overclock the i5 4690 you

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.190 
so you could overclock the i5 4690 you
have<00:00:47.100> for<00:00:47.370> RAM<00:00:47.579> slots<00:00:47.850> rate<00:00:48.239> support<00:00:48.690> for<00:00:48.989> set

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
have for RAM slots rate support for set

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.080 
have for RAM slots rate support for set
