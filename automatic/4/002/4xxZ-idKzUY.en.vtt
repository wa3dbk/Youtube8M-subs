00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
a walk it was my advice day even if it

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.540 
a walk it was my advice day even if it
most<00:00:53.699> competitive<00:00:54.540> rider<00:00:55.199> which<00:00:55.980> is<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.159> reward

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
most competitive rider which is a reward

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.280 
most competitive rider which is a reward
