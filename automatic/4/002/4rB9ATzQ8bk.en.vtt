00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:32.409
 Let's say 

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:34.370
 The titles 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:35.870

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.520
 by the way from a single tour 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.109
 My name is linked to reading my own name because 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:47.180
 so I have supported day bari 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.310
 so 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:49.789
 it's original goes 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:52.789

 where are you here I say something like that 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.490
 0 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.110
 where the winner gains distance 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.760
 union circle 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.450
 puerto barrios 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.820
 it was not enough that in the German capital 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.500
 with other producers 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.760
 the attachment to the time they were doing things from before then I joined with 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.140
 they and 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.870
 that approached us to greet them as 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.850
 productions and all recordings 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.930
 as in 2008 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.930
 driving lights or sick much earlier 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.970
 if now you can say that if you're not 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.970
 after his own self 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.970
 that were done badly we would like 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.970
 the favorite artist I do not have favorite artists in fact there was music but 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.910
 I do not have someone to say 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.390
 offered 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.560
 I think you prefer 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.920
 It's not that you like to do for Pedro 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.640
 this part 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.630
 percent apart country 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.420
 I produce a 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.010
 always the music has lost I am always making music I produce 

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:10.999
 the lyric as well as the music 

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:16.559
 so he worked on both thanks for doing 

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:19.359
 something making music 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:21.359
 and although five by absence 

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:22.809
 we choose 

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:24.729
 semprÃºn itself 

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:27.729
 for me it means being one in itself 

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:31.269
 it means 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:32.529
 get in 

00:02:32.529 --> 00:02:36.719
 one of the four elements because the team that is four elements varies 

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:38.919
 bill bixby goals 

00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:41.079
 graffiti artists and alexis 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:45.169
 then I represent one of the four elements that are read xiii 

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:49.069
 is always to be united verdasco 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:53.079
 you always have to fight Beijing, you want to be better than someone else but 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:57.519
 that not what fidelity in itself but the union so that they grow 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:01.439
 what represents 

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:02.639
 on June 11 a cycle 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:04.029
 in front of this fact 

00:03:04.029 --> 00:03:05.829
 want to be 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:08.009
 the state visit 

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:11.099
 more than anything producing music 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:14.389
 and also writing topics 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:16.329
 per hundred but 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:19.609
 I already have a yes and you could say that a civil 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:22.609
 every day several civilians 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:26.589
 but is to decide is not something so serious 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:30.099
 but rita stability working 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:31.199
 a siri 

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:34.639
 true you could say true something more serious 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:37.059
 various topics and 

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:39.309
 something masses 

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:40.719
 worker 

00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:42.589
 in every way 

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:44.039
 the lusos bolt 

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:45.039
 the reason that is 

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:46.309
 commonly rudder 

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:49.309
 who hid in his profile 

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:54.829
 we all are here 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:56.149
 two 

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:59.149
 we hope this grows does not speak is the same 

00:04:01.559 --> 00:04:04.559
 aspiration so that this grows there is union 

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:08.939
 also base graffiti artists yes 

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:12.459
 more alive and sporting this case the guy and he's the one who's 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:15.149
 Is right 

00:04:15.149 --> 00:04:16.130
 serene 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.499
 chelsea knows but few 

00:04:18.499 --> 00:04:22.139
 but the few of there finally pointed 

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:26.409
 for now the moment 

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:27.699
 what do you want 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:30.699
 because of having thrown there are still 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:36.539
 you can not go to sleep or because you do not think about it 

00:04:37.559 --> 00:04:39.189
 At least two afternoons 

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:43.929
 suazo serve him does not go but I'm just doing this because I know he's 

00:04:43.929 --> 00:04:45.229
 growing and everything 

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:48.840
 but nin novoa always the approach is to grow from what 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:51.370
 Guatemala 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:52.890
 excel 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:56.550
 because here there is good talent what happened in which there is no 

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:58.240
 as 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.139
 means how to exploit it from the then 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:03.909
 there at that extra point 

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:05.520
 at that level 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.520
 north cross 

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:13.020
 somewhat gripped and esther 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.370
 received the bat to Kameni 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:16.900
 they are other values 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.449
 what to do there music and everything 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:22.449
 I met them in 2004 

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:24.259
 i 

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:26.599
 we started 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:28.310
 everyone 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:31.699
 it will not teach us that it had each in itself 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:33.589
 And that was how 

00:05:33.589 --> 00:05:36.659
 artal today the bacteria is 

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:42.150
 with what we were to insist up to a value the tube xx mister ferrer 

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:44.059
 read no 

00:05:44.059 --> 00:05:45.150
 I wanted to hear 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.150
 what is yesterday you will fall 

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:52.980
 since then we have been working with us from there 

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:55.240

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:00.370
 mounts bacteria or assistants i vivar and that is me apart I also have my 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.800
 projects and productions among other things of the contribution 

00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:07.339
 we are with bacteria fungi a group 

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:13.719
 his work also by separate 

00:06:14.589 --> 00:06:15.710
 they have to 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.300
 The Institute of Galician Studies 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.680
 as well as artists 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.279
 can you plan 

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:25.499
 right now I'm recording it 

00:06:25.499 --> 00:06:27.110
 the new circus 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:31.639
 the new issues as I told you and the plan is to start distributing them truth 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.909
 That is the plan 

00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:37.909
 another institution of music for what 

00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:42.589
 people can hear what they talent that here 

00:06:43.509 --> 00:06:48.050
 and can water sixth more debt to also serve as influence 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:52.100
 for other people who are starting in this there 

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:56.449
 If you request more stylized put us kept 

00:06:57.529 --> 00:07:00.629
 and omen 

00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:03.050
 the world receives a comment that will leave 

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:05.349
 the humanitarian operation 

00:07:05.349 --> 00:07:10.750
 then to all those who were there and doing pib volpi who followed graffiti 

00:07:10.749 --> 00:07:13.369
 that elevate there forward 

00:07:13.369 --> 00:07:15.550
 that this is growing and 

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:20.000
 lately they are giving a lot of opportunities in the events that are 

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.029
 they are organizing age for the four elements 

00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:27.019
 well, there, little by little, one becomes known and we are calling people 

00:07:27.019 --> 00:07:29.219
 We are opening spaces for 

00:07:29.219 --> 00:07:30.729
 all the people that 

00:07:30.729 --> 00:07:33.729
 He has talent to show us his talent 

00:07:34.229 --> 00:07:36.039
 do not just stay there 

00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:39.330
 where they are but for now what a lot of people 

00:07:39.919 --> 00:07:42.919
 is the message cale forward positive 

00:07:43.419 --> 00:07:45.819
 up for three or four days 

00:07:45.819 --> 00:07:48.030
 They did not tell us anything
