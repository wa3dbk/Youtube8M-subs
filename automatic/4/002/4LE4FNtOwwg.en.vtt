00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
and the way it's played it is so you'd

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:07.990 
and the way it's played it is so you'd
say<00:01:05.020> each<00:01:06.020> chord<00:01:06.350> is<00:01:06.500> played<00:01:06.530> four<00:01:07.160> times<00:01:07.190> just

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
say each chord is played four times just

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:16.109 
say each chord is played four times just
like<00:01:08.119> that<00:01:11.320> to<00:01:12.320> the<00:01:12.410> G

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.969 

and<00:01:26.720> hopefully<00:01:26.960> the<00:01:27.170> lights<00:01:27.350> help<00:01:27.590> you<00:01:27.710> out<00:01:27.830> to

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:35.440 
and hopefully the lights help you out to
see<00:01:33.009> and<00:01:34.009> the<00:01:34.820> way<00:01:34.909> that<00:01:35.060> should<00:01:35.180> look<00:01:35.299> with

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
see and the way that should look with

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.380 
see and the way that should look with
your<00:01:35.540> Latinos

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.780 

you<00:01:42.229> kind<00:01:42.440> of<00:01:42.500> stop<00:01:42.740> on<00:01:42.920> a<00:01:42.950> dime<00:01:43.250> they're<00:01:43.460> cool

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
you kind of stop on a dime they're cool

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.360 
you kind of stop on a dime they're cool
hole<00:01:44.180> and<00:01:44.570> it<00:01:45.440> starts<00:01:45.770> off<00:01:45.920> with<00:01:45.950> the<00:01:46.190> left

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.370 
hole and it starts off with the left

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.899 
hole and it starts off with the left
hand<00:01:46.659> the<00:01:47.659> left<00:01:47.810> hand<00:01:48.170> is<00:01:48.470> I<00:01:49.070> guess<00:01:49.760> it's

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
hand the left hand is I guess it's

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:51.490 
hand the left hand is I guess it's
called<00:01:50.150> octase<00:01:50.540> I<00:01:50.780> don't<00:01:50.960> know<00:01:51.050> much<00:01:51.140> about<00:01:51.170> it

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
called octase I don't know much about it

00:01:51.500 --> 00:02:11.220 
called octase I don't know much about it
but<00:01:51.680> it's<00:01:52.630> this<00:01:53.630> phase<00:01:53.900> and<00:01:54.680> it<00:01:55.460> starts<00:01:55.760> off

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.949 

one<00:02:12.230> more<00:02:12.350> time<00:02:12.380> without<00:02:13.000> both<00:02:14.000> Jessica<00:02:14.630> sees

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
one more time without both Jessica sees

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:34.660 
one more time without both Jessica sees

while you're playing the left hand is

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:16.650 
while you're playing the left hand is
just<00:03:03.610> going<00:03:03.910> to<00:03:04.000> be<00:03:04.090> simply<00:03:15.330> a<00:03:16.330> bunch<00:03:16.570> of

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
just going to be simply a bunch of

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.370 
just going to be simply a bunch of
variations<00:03:16.990> of<00:03:18.210> old<00:03:19.210> school<00:03:19.450> that's<00:03:19.960> it<00:03:20.170> and

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
variations of old school that's it and

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:27.060 
variations of old school that's it and
then<00:03:20.790> intro<00:03:21.790> is<00:03:21.850> going<00:03:21.970> to<00:03:22.030> be<00:03:22.120> the<00:03:22.780> vs.<00:03:26.070> the

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
then intro is going to be the vs. the

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.140 
then intro is going to be the vs. the
whole<00:03:27.250> thing<00:03:27.810> and<00:03:29.130> the<00:03:30.130> right<00:03:30.310> hand<00:03:30.580> is<00:03:30.790> going

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
whole thing and the right hand is going

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.270 
whole thing and the right hand is going
to<00:03:31.210> be<00:03:31.330> played<00:03:33.210> from<00:03:34.210> here<00:03:34.570> you<00:03:34.810> can<00:03:34.960> see<00:03:35.280> it's

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
to be played from here you can see it's

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:43.320 
to be played from here you can see it's
going<00:03:36.460> to<00:03:36.580> say<00:03:41.820> actually<00:03:42.820> it's<00:03:43.120> probably

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
going to say actually it's probably

00:03:43.330 --> 00:04:18.879 
going to say actually it's probably
easier<00:03:43.870> if<00:03:43.900> I<00:03:44.020> just<00:03:44.050> play<00:03:44.410> it<00:03:44.470> through<00:03:44.890> one<00:03:45.220> go

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:18.889 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:25.280 

and<00:04:20.810> so<00:04:21.830> that's<00:04:22.830> to<00:04:23.280> play<00:04:23.460> that<00:04:23.840> you<00:04:24.840> start<00:04:25.139> off

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
and so that's to play that you start off

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.730 
and so that's to play that you start off
and<00:04:25.590> again<00:04:25.800> left<00:04:26.280> hand<00:04:26.520> is<00:04:26.700> ABC<00:04:27.300> G<00:04:28.050> a<00:04:28.260> minor<00:04:28.440> s

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
and again left hand is ABC G a minor s

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.909 
and again left hand is ABC G a minor s
during<00:04:29.130> that<00:04:29.220> whole<00:04:29.400> thing<00:04:30.500> kind<00:04:31.500> of<00:04:31.590> hard<00:04:31.770> at

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
during that whole thing kind of hard at

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:33.920 
during that whole thing kind of hard at
playing<00:04:32.100> with<00:04:32.220> one<00:04:32.340> hand<00:04:32.580> but<00:04:32.669> anyway<00:04:33.030> the<00:04:33.810> way

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
playing with one hand but anyway the way

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.530 
playing with one hand but anyway the way
that<00:04:34.080> played<00:04:34.380> is<00:04:34.620> you<00:04:34.680> start<00:04:35.220> off<00:04:35.370> from<00:04:35.639> the<00:04:36.120> G

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
that played is you start off from the G

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:42.950 
that played is you start off from the G
the<00:04:37.050> bottom<00:04:37.350> G<00:04:37.500> and<00:04:38.810> go<00:04:40.130> like<00:04:41.130> 1<00:04:41.370> 2<00:04:41.639> with<00:04:41.880> the<00:04:42.240> d
