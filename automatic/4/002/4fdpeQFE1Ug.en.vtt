00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:09.959
 Look, I want out if the question is. 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.700
 a fifa fifa finished the market went bankrupt 

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:13.169
 I found the thing, I just wanted to say that 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.429
 I'm making this video because I 

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:16.230
 I recorded the readers of the way with 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.330
 advance the episodes that 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.850
 You'll see until tomorrow, Sunday. 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.560
 recorded until Tuesday before 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.900
 still had more accuracy and 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.450
 especially with the letters of cristiano 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.360
 ronaldo messi and blue and everything else then 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:32.640
 happened last wednesday 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.820
 forward or so or that 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.690
 happened in July in fifa this is a 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.659
 fifa season that thing really 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:45.690
 green bolano says because he does not have 

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:50.039
 nobody opening pecs there even tried 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:53.159
 put a pack of 25,000 coins to 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.499
 only players with 25,000 this country for 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:58.140
 missing just a minute I'll April here 

00:00:55.499 --> 00:01:01.530
 idea that this pec was putting more 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.699
 pecs but inpex players and more 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.370
 players on the market 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.649
 only one happens here if you do not have 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.869
 almost no chance to take good ones 

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:12.180
 players if you take a player here 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.700
 animal the only go two big 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.579
 players you could draw on pecs 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.680
 at this time would be Cristiano Ronaldo and 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:21.539
 messi we have practically the only two 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.409
 players who cost more than one million 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:25.350
 of copies 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.289
 It's all the other players cost up 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.869
 at most 100 think 200,000 copies 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:34.289
 maybe zlatan is the second player 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.630
 more expensive after you leave and he is 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:39.119
 with its 190 thousand copies only happened 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.039
 you see this flood of dilma need 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.079
 on the internet everything else 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:45.149
 many people bought with 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.740
 that many many people bought 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.780
 fifa points and were yielding the 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.299
 players when they were on high and everything 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.609
 world has a fair amount or very good 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.500
 coins or very good players 

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:57.689
 so what happens no one else 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.369
 need to open a pec for the famous cue 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.060
 I see if I can get a super player 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.219
 Special 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.049
 let me see if I can take it 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.759
 that blue card no longer has that 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.190
 great expectation of a good 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.929
 player on the market so because of that 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.269
 if someone wants to buy the player and he 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.099
 go there and simply search and buy 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:14.940
 so this makes the players 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:16.380
 are 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.750
 rates that even thieves do not 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.030
 were all gone the same thing 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.510
 happens with the kiss for example all 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.700
 world well saved to 170 million 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.370
 who bought half the purchase then does not have 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.620
 more because it is the person opens a pack 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.390
 try to sell players to buy the 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.610
 I tell you, it's everyone. 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.800
 champion has enough coins and because of 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.110
 relatively inexpensive players 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.720
 are being bought as speed 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.180
 possible and this ends up having a 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.710
 effect ball cascade the board of as 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.500
 you want to call first were the 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.420
 rare gold players with the summer more 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.020
 I showed you the good or the 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.510
 ibrahimovic ti suÃ¡rez to the very 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.910
 neymar these players they start to 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.490
 disappear from the market with an idez knife 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.320
 absurd the next players in the list 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:05.760
 that already have two ended up being listed 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.990
 of users and most probably 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.110
 few seconds 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:12.270
 they will disappear from the market after that 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.800
 come the players talk a little more 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.320
 Down, then, talk some more. 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.150
 that the bag is here 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.610
 placed that was not probably going to 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.470
 who are the neymar are players who 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.060
 Seven years from now, it will be gone 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.459
 schumi left neymar a while ago 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.350
 do not look at neymar has already abandoned the 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.090
 his normal house was extinguished in the market 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.430
 and soon good players too 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.590
 fade away and sergio ramos instinct 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.360
 market then all good players 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.310
 overall then they are highly sought after 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.040
 no time will start to assume 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.110
 gradually and they will only appear in the 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.980
 maximum bid and after that they will 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.989
 to disappear 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.000
 what is the next step the players 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.560
 informs if players report that neither 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.840
 It's the one we see now they 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.060
 they will probably start to be 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.030
 bought more and will end up assuming 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.459
 so then there is what you can do 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.739
 trade can still be done with players 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:04.050
 Tell us some of this. 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:05.970
 on the way forward and with 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.640
 team players still need this 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.440
 what probably happens there 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.450
 will do spoke probably because 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.970
 This is the first year that we have the 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.880
 such a large country is very likely to 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.709
 there, raise the price of all 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.940
 players then players will see 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.800
 high will go up 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.410
 I think I quite believe the price 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.900
 players to see you up to ac 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.620
 lacazette came out through practically 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.360
 for the price 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.040
 the maximum of it then the reforms will 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.080
 start also take market 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.520
 so I think it's going to start going up there 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.030
 will raise the price of players 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.979
 It is rarer and maybe some people 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.660
 will be in the market but like everyone else 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:43.590
 you must already have a good average amount 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.930
 of coins 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.040
 I think it is unlikely that the market will 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.410
 recover what I call myself 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.690
 recover in a flood of players 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.320
 for you to choose and buy the ones you 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.330
 want to 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.460
 some 3g methods still work the 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:59.340
 of the way you can also look for more 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:02.639
 They will certainly give you more headache. 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:05.789
 after that I believe it is perhaps the 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:08.699
 average players measure their last show 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:09.870
 in 85/86 which are its towers are the 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:12.090
 its branches 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:15.389
 these may also have an increase 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:17.580
 of the price of them and who knows eventually 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:19.470
 begin to appear more on the market but 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.220
 I still do not think it will. 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.870
 to happen 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.550
 the next drops of hope and 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:26.340
 market hope come back a little bit 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:28.440
 sound of the fuchs that are those letters 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:31.440
 roses to be voted on by people 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:33.330
 here the foods are pink letters that you 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:36.479
 They will come back and they will appear 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:38.310
 probably next Wednesday I 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:39.479
 I think they will appear and if it is not 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.880
 on Wednesday will be at the end of 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:43.740
 week they will appear on the market and 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.789
 maybe people open a little 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.789
 more than pecs 

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:50.340
 after that I think the team needs to 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:52.320
 League is American 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:54.270
 I just do not know if it's going to be so 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.580
 interesting so you have another one 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:59.190
 player of the American league who really 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:01.580
 would be worth buying then because of 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:05.820
 Moreover, the fifa market probably 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:08.669
 will be in decline until the end of 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:09.449
 15th fifa fifa 1650 costa arrives in 

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:11.010
 September 

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:13.080
 before that we sell things 

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:14.940
 they start to warm up a little bit then 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.370
 this is more or less the reason why 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:19.590
 my view the market is this way for 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:20.970
 sign a kaka for 1200 thing that I go 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:22.680
 keep an eye on it when the 

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:26.639
 comment because when your team 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:28.470
 needs 99 mls 9% chance that 

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:29.460
 he is there and probably the price 

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:30.449
 it will rise 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.729
 although I think it is already 

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:34.080
 relatively high price of this kaka is 

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:36.150
 basically this for you to have 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:37.140
 understood because the market is the 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.789
 the way he is 

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:41.159
 prices are likely to rise one 

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:41.940
 little but I do not think it 's better 

00:06:41.159 --> 00:06:43.620
 sell 

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:45.360
 dorival - you need the coins to 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.800
 buy another but will still have 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.520
 difficulty to buy this new 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.800
 player 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:51.780
 so it's more or less this line of 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:53.880
 reasoning, we are going to win and there 

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.990
 miracle to recover this market and 

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:57.210
 for now we are following 

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:58.560
 keep an eye on us today we're going 

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:00.960
 have a video of the path ie we 

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:02.640
 Let's have three uploads this Saturday 

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.920
 so if you want this to continue with 

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:07.650
 frequency bursts in lic send your 

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:09.870
 comment on this fall in the 

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:12.450
 what do you think could there be 

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:14.640
 make this market give an improvement 

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:18.230
 I hope you have enjoyed it because here 

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:21.230
 is as usual the caps size of 

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:21.230
 turning off
