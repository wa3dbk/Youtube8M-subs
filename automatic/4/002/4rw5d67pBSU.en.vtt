00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.519 
asked for another video hmm very nice so
I<00:00:13.469> caused<00:00:14.280> a<00:00:14.309> bit<00:00:14.460> of<00:00:14.490> confusion<00:00:14.809> initially<00:00:15.809> by

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
I caused a bit of confusion initially by

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.599 
I caused a bit of confusion initially by
putting<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.720> thumb<00:00:18.720> screws<00:00:19.140> that<00:00:19.859> come<00:00:20.340> with

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
putting the thumb screws that come with

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.900 
putting the thumb screws that come with
the<00:00:20.850> Reuter<00:00:21.480> pixel<00:00:21.900> in<00:00:22.080> incorrectly<00:00:22.910> then

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
the Reuter pixel in incorrectly then

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.609 
the Reuter pixel in incorrectly then
caused<00:00:24.180> even<00:00:24.330> more<00:00:24.449> confusion<00:00:25.109> by<00:00:25.320> trying<00:00:25.560> to

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
caused even more confusion by trying to

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.290 
caused even more confusion by trying to
explain<00:00:26.039> what<00:00:26.250> I've<00:00:26.369> done<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:26.910> how<00:00:27.240> to

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
explain what I've done and how to

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.570 
explain what I've done and how to
correct<00:00:27.630> it<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:27.960> then<00:00:28.740> try<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.130> upload<00:00:29.519> a

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
correct it and then try to upload a

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.600 
correct it and then try to upload a
photo<00:00:29.880> that<00:00:30.060> was<00:00:30.240> just<00:00:30.619> well<00:00:31.619> anyway<00:00:32.040> is<00:00:32.340> it

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
photo that was just well anyway is it

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.430 
photo that was just well anyway is it
it's<00:00:32.910> easy<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.239> do<00:00:33.360> this<00:00:33.450> way<00:00:33.630> so<00:00:34.020> basically

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
it's easy to do this way so basically

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.770 
it's easy to do this way so basically
when<00:00:34.649> you're<00:00:34.860> you've<00:00:35.460> got<00:00:35.670> your<00:00:35.850> your<00:00:36.329> gimbal

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
when you're you've got your your gimbal

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.130 
when you're you've got your your gimbal
attached<00:00:37.110> into<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.770> dampers<00:00:38.129> like<00:00:38.309> this<00:00:39.140> each

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
attached into the dampers like this each

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.150 
attached into the dampers like this each
corner<00:00:40.940> has<00:00:41.960> one<00:00:42.960> of<00:00:43.050> these<00:00:43.200> little

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
corner has one of these little

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.740 
corner has one of these little
rubberized<00:00:46.160> captive<00:00:47.160> nuts<00:00:48.260> one<00:00:49.260> of<00:00:49.350> these

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
rubberized captive nuts one of these

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.569 
rubberized captive nuts one of these
screw<00:00:51.750> with<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:51.899> very<00:00:52.320> nicely<00:00:52.530> 3d<00:00:53.309> printed

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
screw with a very nicely 3d printed

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:59.029 
screw with a very nicely 3d printed
finger<00:00:56.579> tourney<00:00:57.379> wheelie<00:00:58.379> thumb<00:00:58.680> screwy

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
finger tourney wheelie thumb screwy

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.880 
finger tourney wheelie thumb screwy
thing<00:00:59.340> so<00:01:00.149> on<00:01:00.780> each<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.320> four<00:01:01.500> corners<00:01:01.800> I'm

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
thing so on each of the four corners I'm

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.319 
thing so on each of the four corners I'm
going<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.190> with<00:01:02.280> this<00:01:02.370> one<00:01:02.579> for<00:01:03.030> two<00:01:03.180> reasons

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
going to with this one for two reasons

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.530 
going to with this one for two reasons
one<00:01:03.600> its<00:01:03.750> easier<00:01:04.369> to<00:01:05.369> do<00:01:05.610> because<00:01:06.150> it's<00:01:06.360> in<00:01:06.510> the

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
one its easier to do because it's in the

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.350 
one its easier to do because it's in the
clear<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:07.049> two<00:01:07.290> it's<00:01:07.439> easy<00:01:07.590> for<00:01:07.770> you<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:07.979> see

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
clear and two it's easy for you to see

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.640 
clear and two it's easy for you to see
when<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:09.479> come<00:01:09.630> to<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.840> ones<00:01:09.990> on<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.200> corners

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
when you come to the ones on the corners

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.800 
when you come to the ones on the corners
you're<00:01:10.890> going<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.100> have<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.369> sort<00:01:11.580> of<00:01:11.640> angle<00:01:12.479> it

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
you're going to have to sort of angle it

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.539 
you're going to have to sort of angle it
in<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.439> as<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:13.890> says<00:01:14.070> in<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.220> instructions

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
in and as it says in the instructions

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.160 
in and as it says in the instructions
maybe<00:01:15.000> use<00:01:15.240> one<00:01:15.390> of<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.509> allen<00:01:15.750> keys<00:01:15.990> that

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
maybe use one of the allen keys that

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.140 
maybe use one of the allen keys that
came<00:01:16.350> with<00:01:16.470> it<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.650> sort<00:01:16.799> of<00:01:16.860> prayer<00:01:17.310> sit<00:01:17.670> down

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
came with it to sort of prayer sit down

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.090 
came with it to sort of prayer sit down
in<00:01:18.479> but<00:01:18.750> basically<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.530> want<00:01:19.619> to<00:01:19.740> be<00:01:19.799> putting

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
in but basically you want to be putting

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.280 
in but basically you want to be putting
that<00:01:20.220> in<00:01:20.880> there<00:01:20.939> like<00:01:21.360> that<00:01:23.990> pop<00:01:24.990> this<00:01:25.110> up

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
that in there like that pop this up

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.749 
that in there like that pop this up
there<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:25.770> if<00:01:25.890> you<00:01:26.009> squeeze<00:01:26.490> it<00:01:26.610> together

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
there and if you squeeze it together

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.810 
there and if you squeeze it together
you'll<00:01:27.119> find<00:01:27.479> where<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.110> right<00:01:29.040> gets<00:01:29.369> like<00:01:29.610> it

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
you'll find where it right gets like it

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.069 
you'll find where it right gets like it
going<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.119> get<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:30.329> just<00:01:30.540> sits<00:01:30.720> good<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:30.990> then

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
going to get it just sits good and then

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.149 
going to get it just sits good and then
I'm<00:01:31.200> going<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.380> go<00:01:31.530> a<00:01:31.860> half<00:01:32.850> turn<00:01:33.299> whole<00:01:34.170> turn<00:01:34.500> 1

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
I'm going to go a half turn whole turn 1

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:44.210 
I'm going to go a half turn whole turn 1
r<00:01:35.939> 2<00:01:36.409> r<00:01:37.409> 3<00:01:37.850> half<00:01:38.850> for<00:01:39.600> half<00:01:40.259> five<00:01:41.009> half<00:01:41.990> six<00:01:43.220> add

r 2 r 3 half for half five half six add

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.330 
r 2 r 3 half for half five half six add
a<00:01:44.280> bit<00:01:44.579> for<00:01:44.610> luck<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.590> I<00:01:46.590> have<00:01:46.829> mine<00:01:47.040> sort<00:01:47.280> of

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
a bit for luck and I have mine sort of

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.649 
a bit for luck and I have mine sort of
hanging<00:01:47.579> out<00:01:47.729> like<00:01:47.880> this<00:01:48.090> but<00:01:48.149> what<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:48.630> need

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
hanging out like this but what you need

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.969 
hanging out like this but what you need
to<00:01:48.840> do<00:01:49.110> is<00:01:49.409> basically<00:01:50.009> pull<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:51.329> gimbal<00:01:53.090> down

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
to do is basically pull the gimbal down

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.859 
to do is basically pull the gimbal down
over<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.820> screw<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.149> it<00:01:57.240> should<00:01:57.420> be<00:01:57.509> a<00:01:57.540> snug

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
over the screw and it should be a snug

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.840 
over the screw and it should be a snug
fit<00:01:57.899> it<00:01:58.380> shouldn't<00:01:58.680> be<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.829> loose<00:01:59.399> thing<00:01:59.700> which

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
fit it shouldn't be a loose thing which

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.429 
fit it shouldn't be a loose thing which
I<00:02:00.030> krause<00:02:00.329> gonna<00:02:00.630> confuse<00:02:00.960> because<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.320> was

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
I krause gonna confuse because it was

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.060 
I krause gonna confuse because it was
stiff<00:02:01.740> it<00:02:02.700> should<00:02:02.880> be<00:02:02.909> a<00:02:03.030> snug<00:02:03.390> fit<00:02:03.469> and<00:02:04.469> then

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
stiff it should be a snug fit and then

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.119 
stiff it should be a snug fit and then
if<00:02:05.340> we<00:02:05.490> have<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.640> look<00:02:05.820> here<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.240> can<00:02:06.299> see<00:02:07.129> you

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
if we have a look here you can see you

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.290 
if we have a look here you can see you
pull<00:02:08.369> this<00:02:08.520> down<00:02:08.759> here<00:02:09.590> there<00:02:10.590> we<00:02:10.679> go<00:02:11.180> so<00:02:12.180> we

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
pull this down here there we go so we

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.510 
pull this down here there we go so we
shall<00:02:12.450> have<00:02:12.540> this

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
shall have this

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.760 
shall have this
flush<00:02:13.970> with<00:02:14.210> the<00:02:14.240> top<00:02:14.330> of<00:02:14.510> the<00:02:14.660> damper<00:02:15.050> this

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
flush with the top of the damper this

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.130 
flush with the top of the damper this

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
flush with the bottom bit and then this

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.930 
flush with the bottom bit and then this
is<00:02:18.320> what<00:02:18.440> allows<00:02:18.740> you<00:02:18.950> to<00:02:19.130> give<00:02:19.340> you<00:02:19.460> give<00:02:19.820> you

is what allows you to give you give you

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.640 
is what allows you to give you give you
some<00:02:20.420> adjustment<00:02:20.930> and<00:02:21.050> you<00:02:21.140> can<00:02:21.260> see<00:02:21.470> now

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
some adjustment and you can see now

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.830 
some adjustment and you can see now

little<00:03:14.600> screws<00:03:14.960> in<00:03:15.080> there<00:03:15.200> so<00:03:15.860> that's<00:03:16.010> how<00:03:16.130> to

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.250 
little screws in there so that's how to

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.830 
little screws in there so that's how to
correctly<00:03:17.620> fit<00:03:18.620> via<00:03:19.520> rotor<00:03:20.120> pixel<00:03:20.600> thumb

correctly fit via rotor pixel thumb

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.040 
correctly fit via rotor pixel thumb
screws<00:03:21.190> so<00:03:22.190> as<00:03:22.310> we<00:03:22.459> said<00:03:22.670> adjustment<00:03:23.450> to<00:03:23.930> get

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
screws so as we said adjustment to get

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.130 
screws so as we said adjustment to get
the<00:03:24.110> right<00:03:24.260> bit<00:03:24.530> of<00:03:24.650> vibration<00:03:25.010> damping<00:03:25.790> but

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
the right bit of vibration damping but

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.810 
the right bit of vibration damping but
even<00:03:27.140> better<00:03:27.320> than<00:03:27.530> as<00:03:27.709> an<00:03:27.890> added<00:03:28.130> bonus<00:03:28.280> as

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:28.820 
even better than as an added bonus as

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.730 
even better than as an added bonus as
well<00:03:29.000> no<00:03:29.390> need<00:03:29.570> to<00:03:29.600> get<00:03:29.870> your<00:03:29.990> cable<00:03:30.170> ties<00:03:30.500> or

well no need to get your cable ties or

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:31.990 
well no need to get your cable ties or

balanced<00:03:43.150> I've<00:03:44.150> now<00:03:44.510> balanced<00:03:45.020> it<00:03:45.140> up<00:03:45.260> and<00:03:45.500> as

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
balanced I've now balanced it up and as

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.710 
balanced I've now balanced it up and as
you<00:03:45.650> can<00:03:45.800> see<00:03:45.830> I'm<00:03:46.160> holding<00:03:46.520> it<00:03:46.640> neutral<00:03:47.510> in

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
you can see I'm holding it neutral in

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.900 
you can see I'm holding it neutral in
power<00:03:48.140> off<00:03:48.350> and<00:03:48.560> it's<00:03:48.650> which<00:03:49.040> balances<00:03:49.310> ever

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
power off and it's which balances ever

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.530 
power off and it's which balances ever
so<00:03:50.120> slightly<00:03:51.490> do<00:03:52.490> they're<00:03:52.730> ever<00:03:53.030> so<00:03:53.180> slightly

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
so slightly do they're ever so slightly

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.960 
so slightly do they're ever so slightly
high<00:03:54.170> but<00:03:55.130> that's<00:03:55.310> because<00:03:55.459> obviously<00:03:55.760> I'm

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
high but that's because obviously I'm

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.340 
high but that's because obviously I'm
going<00:03:56.090> to<00:03:56.150> put<00:03:56.270> a<00:03:56.300> filter<00:03:56.720> on<00:03:56.930> there<00:03:57.200> which

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
going to put a filter on there which

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.380 
going to put a filter on there which
will<00:03:57.470> bring<00:03:57.590> it<00:03:57.770> down<00:03:57.980> to<00:03:58.370> associate<00:03:59.120> spring

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
will bring it down to associate spring

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.390 
will bring it down to associate spring
as<00:03:59.540> least<00:04:00.020> strain<00:04:00.440> on<00:04:00.530> the<00:04:00.620> most<00:04:00.770> as<00:04:00.920> possible

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
as least strain on the most as possible

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.390 
as least strain on the most as possible
you<00:04:02.330> can<00:04:02.480> see<00:04:02.720> it's<00:04:02.959> also<00:04:03.140> also<00:04:03.650> bounced<00:04:04.010> it<00:04:04.160> on

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
you can see it's also also bounced it on

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.000 
you can see it's also also bounced it on
that<00:04:05.300> axis<00:04:05.770> that<00:04:06.770> was<00:04:06.860> pretty

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
that axis that was pretty

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.100 
that axis that was pretty
straightforward<00:04:07.580> so<00:04:07.790> I'm<00:04:08.030> not<00:04:08.900> gonna<00:04:09.020> do

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
straightforward so I'm not gonna do

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:10.270 
straightforward so I'm not gonna do
another<00:04:09.260> one<00:04:09.380> tonight<00:04:09.530> but<00:04:09.830> I'm<00:04:09.920> going<00:04:10.100> to<00:04:10.160> do

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
another one tonight but I'm going to do

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.360 
another one tonight but I'm going to do

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:14.590 
might do one tomorrow as well as
hopefully<00:04:13.550> a<00:04:13.730> bit<00:04:13.850> of<00:04:13.910> a<00:04:13.970> flight<00:04:14.180> video<00:04:14.450> but

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600 
hopefully a bit of a flight video but

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.630 
hopefully a bit of a flight video but
we'll<00:04:14.720> see<00:04:14.930> if<00:04:15.050> not<00:04:15.230> so<00:04:15.410> many<00:04:15.560> Sunday<00:04:15.920> so<00:04:16.609> I
