upgrade actually practical to use and as
you're<00:00:46.260> worth<00:00:46.410> upgrading<00:00:46.649> so<00:00:47.250> for<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.940> most

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
you're worth upgrading so for the most

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.450 
you're worth upgrading so for the most
part<00:00:48.570> it's<00:00:48.870> pretty<00:00:49.500> much<00:00:49.680> worth<00:00:49.980> that<00:00:50.190> I<00:00:50.250> mean

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
part it's pretty much worth that I mean

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.979 
part it's pretty much worth that I mean
there's<00:00:50.820> not<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.059> lot<00:00:51.390> of<00:00:51.420> people<00:00:51.809> that<00:00:51.899> are

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
there's not a lot of people that are

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.840 
there's not a lot of people that are
actually<00:00:52.079> attacking<00:00:52.379> me<00:00:52.949> but<00:00:53.309> that's<00:00:53.550> also

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
actually attacking me but that's also

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.700 
actually attacking me but that's also
kind<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.420> bad<00:00:54.570> thing<00:00:54.600> because<00:00:55.020> you<00:00:55.410> know<00:00:55.440> if

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
kind of a bad thing because you know if

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.770 
kind of a bad thing because you know if
you're<00:00:55.949> one<00:00:56.670> of<00:00:56.789> those<00:00:56.879> people<00:00:57.300> that<00:00:57.329> like<00:00:57.750> to

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
you're one of those people that like to

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.500 
you're one of those people that like to
scull<00:00:58.590> for<00:00:58.980> gold<00:00:59.280> then<00:00:59.609> you<00:00:59.879> know<00:01:00.000> maybe<00:01:00.300> this

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
scull for gold then you know maybe this

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.479 
scull for gold then you know maybe this
isn't<00:01:00.719> exactly<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.350> way<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:01.890> you<00:01:02.129> should

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
isn't exactly the way that you should

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.850 
isn't exactly the way that you should
look<00:01:03.300> at<00:01:03.449> things<00:01:03.660> like<00:01:03.780> instead<00:01:04.559> of<00:01:04.650> upgrading

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
look at things like instead of upgrading

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.030 
look at things like instead of upgrading
the<00:01:05.220> lock<00:01:05.780> the<00:01:06.780> lock<00:01:07.020> side<00:01:07.290> probably<00:01:07.619> upgrade

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
the lock the lock side probably upgrade

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.670 
the lock the lock side probably upgrade
the<00:01:08.280> gem<00:01:08.640> defense<00:01:08.909> chance<00:01:09.210> first<00:01:09.630> as<00:01:09.930> well<00:01:10.500> as

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
the gem defense chance first as well as

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.469 
the gem defense chance first as well as
like<00:01:10.920> pretty<00:01:11.159> much<00:01:11.220> everything<00:01:11.549> else<00:01:11.880> but<00:01:12.330> the

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
like pretty much everything else but the

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.230 
like pretty much everything else but the
locks<00:01:12.720> if<00:01:12.930> you're<00:01:13.080> just<00:01:13.380> focusing<00:01:13.950> on<00:01:14.240> skulls

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
locks if you're just focusing on skulls

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.270 
locks if you're just focusing on skulls
to<00:01:15.750> get<00:01:15.930> your<00:01:16.080> gold<00:01:16.409> which<00:01:16.890> is<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.100> only

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
to get your gold which is the only

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.219 
to get your gold which is the only
downside<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.880> this<00:01:18.030> whole<00:01:18.270> thing<00:01:18.540> like<00:01:18.750> I've

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
downside to this whole thing like I've

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.590 
downside to this whole thing like I've
noticed<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:19.740> ever<00:01:20.520> since<00:01:20.729> I've<00:01:20.880> maxed<00:01:21.420> out

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
noticed that ever since I've maxed out

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.420 
noticed that ever since I've maxed out
my<00:01:21.630> lock<00:01:22.140> upgrade<00:01:22.500> I<00:01:22.530> haven't<00:01:23.070> been<00:01:23.189> really

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
my lock upgrade I haven't been really

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.280 
my lock upgrade I haven't been really
getting<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.909> ton<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.360> gold<00:01:24.659> I'm<00:01:24.900> still<00:01:25.110> getting

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
getting a ton of gold I'm still getting

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.719 
getting a ton of gold I'm still getting
a<00:01:25.320> fair<00:01:25.560> amount<00:01:25.619> just<00:01:26.100> because<00:01:26.340> of<00:01:26.490> the

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
a fair amount just because of the

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.210 
a fair amount just because of the
particular<00:01:27.000> baseline<00:01:27.509> I'm<00:01:27.600> using<00:01:27.810> but<00:01:28.650> for

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
particular baseline I'm using but for

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.090 
particular baseline I'm using but for
the<00:01:29.280> most<00:01:29.520> part<00:01:29.790> it's<00:01:29.939> like<00:01:30.090> not<00:01:30.450> too

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
the most part it's like not too

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.350 
the most part it's like not too
fantastic<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.159> mean<00:01:32.280> if<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.549> see<00:01:32.729> these<00:01:32.909> recent

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
fantastic I mean if you see these recent

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.990 
fantastic I mean if you see these recent
results<00:01:33.720> like<00:01:34.020> I<00:01:34.049> don't<00:01:34.320> know<00:01:34.409> like<00:01:35.220> 11<00:01:35.820> deaths

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
results like I don't know like 11 deaths

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.840 
results like I don't know like 11 deaths
one<00:01:36.390> death<00:01:36.659> 43<00:01:37.470> is<00:01:37.530> okay<00:01:38.040> but<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.520> know<00:01:38.670> for

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
one death 43 is okay but you know for

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.060 
one death 43 is okay but you know for
the<00:01:38.909> most<00:01:39.000> part<00:01:39.150> it's<00:01:39.420> not<00:01:39.710> astounding<00:01:40.710> and

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
the most part it's not astounding and

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.520 
the most part it's not astounding and
another<00:01:41.820> disadvantage<00:01:42.509> that<00:01:42.570> I<00:01:42.720> find<00:01:43.259> with

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
another disadvantage that I find with

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.440 
another disadvantage that I find with
this<00:01:43.740> is<00:01:43.890> that<00:01:44.070> it's<00:01:44.520> true<00:01:44.880> that<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.360> know

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
this is that it's true that you know

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.850 
this is that it's true that you know
there's<00:01:45.630> less<00:01:45.810> people<00:01:46.079> that<00:01:46.290> are<00:01:46.409> attacking

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
there's less people that are attacking

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.789 
there's less people that are attacking
me<00:01:46.920> because<00:01:47.340> they<00:01:47.939> require<00:01:48.390> so<00:01:49.020> many<00:01:49.200> locks<00:01:49.560> to

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
me because they require so many locks to

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.800 
me because they require so many locks to
actually<00:01:50.100> break<00:01:50.399> through<00:01:50.790> your<00:01:51.149> base<00:01:51.390> because

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
actually break through your base because

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.340 
actually break through your base because
I<00:01:51.840> think<00:01:51.960> it's<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.380> total<00:01:52.710> of<00:01:53.299> let's<00:01:54.299> see<00:01:54.689> yeah

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
I think it's a total of let's see yeah

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.160 
I think it's a total of let's see yeah
each<00:01:55.649> goal<00:01:56.040> lock<00:01:56.280> is<00:01:56.520> about<00:01:56.820> 12<00:01:57.299> locks<00:01:57.840> I

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
each goal lock is about 12 locks I

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.020 
each goal lock is about 12 locks I
believe<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:58.890> so<00:01:59.159> 12<00:01:59.520> times<00:02:01.399> 12<00:02:02.399> times<00:02:02.640> 12<00:02:02.850> so

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
believe and so 12 times 12 times 12 so

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.730 
believe and so 12 times 12 times 12 so
that's<00:02:03.180> like<00:02:03.299> a<00:02:03.420> hundred<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.899> forty-four

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
that's like a hundred and forty-four

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.499 
that's like a hundred and forty-four
wait<00:02:05.219> is<00:02:05.310> that<00:02:05.399> even<00:02:05.579> right<00:02:05.729> let<00:02:06.210> me<00:02:06.240> read<00:02:06.420> this

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
wait is that even right let me read this

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.380 
wait is that even right let me read this
again<00:02:06.630> no<00:02:07.560> no<00:02:07.680> I<00:02:07.710> think<00:02:07.829> I<00:02:08.670> think<00:02:08.849> this<00:02:09.239> just

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
again no no I think I think this just

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.790 
again no no I think I think this just
means<00:02:09.599> that<00:02:09.690> there's<00:02:09.869> twelve<00:02:10.110> locks<00:02:10.319> in<00:02:10.470> total

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
means that there's twelve locks in total

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.809 
means that there's twelve locks in total
but<00:02:10.950> I<00:02:11.220> can

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
but I can

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.940 
but I can
remember<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.599> value<00:02:13.079> of<00:02:13.230> a<00:02:13.349> golden<00:02:13.709> like<00:02:13.859> I

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
remember the value of a golden like I

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.920 
remember the value of a golden like I
think<00:02:14.159> it<00:02:14.280> was<00:02:14.400> six<00:02:14.760> lakhs<00:02:15.030> so<00:02:15.329> if<00:02:15.390> that's<00:02:15.510> true

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
think it was six lakhs so if that's true

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.750 
think it was six lakhs so if that's true
then<00:02:16.469> twelve<00:02:16.950> times<00:02:17.280> six

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
then twelve times six

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.899 
then twelve times six
that's<00:02:18.420> like<00:02:19.310> 72<00:02:20.310> I<00:02:20.579> think<00:02:21.090> yea<00:02:21.629> 72<00:02:22.230> so<00:02:23.189> yes<00:02:23.670> it

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:23.909 
that's like 72 I think yea 72 so yes it

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:25.699 
that's like 72 I think yea 72 so yes it
takes<00:02:24.060> about<00:02:24.180> 72<00:02:24.719> lakhs<00:02:24.959> to<00:02:25.139> break<00:02:25.469> through

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
takes about 72 lakhs to break through

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.440 
takes about 72 lakhs to break through
every<00:02:26.189> single<00:02:26.519> goal<00:02:26.700> lock<00:02:26.939> if<00:02:27.090> you're<00:02:27.209> really

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
every single goal lock if you're really

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.929 
every single goal lock if you're really
unlucky<00:02:27.599> and<00:02:28.500> so<00:02:29.099> you<00:02:29.489> know<00:02:29.549> that's<00:02:29.700> a<00:02:29.819> good

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:29.939 
unlucky and so you know that's a good

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:32.149 
unlucky and so you know that's a good
thing<00:02:30.150> because<00:02:30.239> most<00:02:30.540> people<00:02:30.989> don't<00:02:31.230> have<00:02:31.379> 72

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:32.159 
thing because most people don't have 72

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:34.339 
thing because most people don't have 72
locks<00:02:32.489> and<00:02:32.849> you<00:02:32.909> know<00:02:33.689> for<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:33.989> most<00:02:34.170> part

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:34.349 
locks and you know for the most part

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.080 
locks and you know for the most part
they're<00:02:34.859> kind<00:02:35.099> of<00:02:35.159> unlucky<00:02:35.459> because<00:02:35.760> that's

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
they're kind of unlucky because that's

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.649 
they're kind of unlucky because that's
how<00:02:36.239> orangey<00:02:36.689> goes<00:02:36.900> but<00:02:37.879> the<00:02:38.879> thing<00:02:39.419> about

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:39.659 
how orangey goes but the thing about

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:42.170 
how orangey goes but the thing about
this<00:02:39.840> is<00:02:39.989> that<00:02:40.400> really<00:02:41.400> high-level<00:02:41.669> players

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
this is that really high-level players

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.959 
this is that really high-level players

hollow<00:03:36.389> players<00:03:37.400> high-level<00:03:38.400> the<00:03:38.519> players

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:38.849 
hollow players high-level the players

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:40.819 
hollow players high-level the players
sorry<00:03:39.299> are<00:03:39.509> going<00:03:39.780> to<00:03:39.959> steal<00:03:40.259> your<00:03:40.530> gems

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
sorry are going to steal your gems

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:42.969 
sorry are going to steal your gems
because<00:03:41.459> they're<00:03:41.759> very<00:03:41.909> good<00:03:42.419> at<00:03:42.599> it<00:03:42.750> so

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:42.979 
because they're very good at it so

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:44.809 
because they're very good at it so
that's<00:03:43.979> just<00:03:44.129> something<00:03:44.340> that<00:03:44.430> you<00:03:44.549> want<00:03:44.759> to

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
that's just something that you want to

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:47.360 
that's just something that you want to
consider<00:03:44.959> but<00:03:45.959> I<00:03:46.379> guess<00:03:46.799> in<00:03:47.040> terms<00:03:47.220> of

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
consider but I guess in terms of

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.280 
consider but I guess in terms of
aesthetics<00:03:48.239> and<00:03:48.540> stuff<00:03:48.930> like<00:03:49.049> that<00:03:49.199> I<00:03:49.259> mean

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
aesthetics and stuff like that I mean

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.409 
aesthetics and stuff like that I mean
you<00:03:49.470> know<00:03:49.560> having<00:03:49.739> 12<00:03:50.400> golden<00:03:50.879> locks<00:03:51.120> on<00:03:51.389> your

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:51.419 
you know having 12 golden locks on your

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:54.319 
you know having 12 golden locks on your
door<00:03:51.780> is<00:03:52.019> pretty<00:03:52.500> intimidating<00:03:52.859> I<00:03:53.430> mean<00:03:53.879> I<00:03:54.060> I

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:54.329 
door is pretty intimidating I mean I I

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:56.030 
door is pretty intimidating I mean I I
guess<00:03:54.599> that's<00:03:54.780> another<00:03:55.019> factor<00:03:55.500> that<00:03:55.650> could

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
guess that's another factor that could

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.429 
guess that's another factor that could
be<00:03:56.189> taking<00:03:56.549> into<00:03:56.790> account<00:03:56.819> where<00:03:57.439> most

00:03:58.429 --> 00:03:58.439 
be taking into account where most

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:00.499 
be taking into account where most
players<00:03:58.769> if<00:03:59.159> they<00:03:59.340> see<00:03:59.400> that<00:03:59.969> your<00:04:00.150> door<00:04:00.479> is

00:04:00.499 --> 00:04:00.509 
players if they see that your door is

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:02.839 
players if they see that your door is
full<00:04:01.109> of<00:04:01.259> golden<00:04:01.560> locks<00:04:01.799> like<00:04:02.099> from<00:04:02.549> the<00:04:02.669> top

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:02.849 
full of golden locks like from the top

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:05.509 
full of golden locks like from the top
to<00:04:03.000> the<00:04:03.090> bottom<00:04:03.239> then<00:04:04.079> the<00:04:04.489> likelihood<00:04:05.489> of

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
to the bottom then the likelihood of

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.249 
to the bottom then the likelihood of
them<00:04:05.759> attacking<00:04:06.060> your<00:04:06.269> base<00:04:06.449> is<00:04:06.750> going<00:04:07.049> to<00:04:07.139> be

00:04:07.249 --> 00:04:07.259 
them attacking your base is going to be

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:09.229 
them attacking your base is going to be
slimmer<00:04:07.709> because<00:04:08.129> you<00:04:08.280> know<00:04:08.430> I<00:04:08.699> don't<00:04:09.180> know

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
slimmer because you know I don't know

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:10.459 
slimmer because you know I don't know
for<00:04:09.449> the<00:04:09.509> most<00:04:09.629> part<00:04:09.750> people<00:04:10.019> are<00:04:10.169> rating

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:10.469 
for the most part people are rating

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:11.749 
for the most part people are rating
constantly<00:04:10.979> they're<00:04:11.129> not<00:04:11.280> gonna<00:04:11.400> have<00:04:11.549> enough

00:04:11.749 --> 00:04:11.759 
constantly they're not gonna have enough

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:14.390 
constantly they're not gonna have enough
keys<00:04:12.329> anyways<00:04:13.169> if<00:04:13.469> they've<00:04:13.650> already<00:04:13.979> raided

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
keys anyways if they've already raided

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.339 
keys anyways if they've already raided
like<00:04:14.789> maybe<00:04:15.120> three<00:04:15.419> or<00:04:15.449> four<00:04:15.569> bases<00:04:16.169> before

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:16.349 
like maybe three or four bases before

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:19.009 
like maybe three or four bases before
yours<00:04:16.799> so<00:04:17.280> you<00:04:17.880> know<00:04:18.000> there<00:04:18.329> is<00:04:18.479> a<00:04:18.509> lot<00:04:18.870> of

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
yours so you know there is a lot of

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.140 
yours so you know there is a lot of
things<00:04:19.199> that<00:04:19.380> could<00:04:19.530> save<00:04:19.829> you<00:04:20.039> in<00:04:20.250> that<00:04:20.880> case

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
things that could save you in that case

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.600 
things that could save you in that case
but<00:04:21.750> it's<00:04:21.989> just<00:04:22.320> in<00:04:22.500> the<00:04:22.740> intimidation<00:04:23.039> factor

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
but it's just in the intimidation factor

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.629 
but it's just in the intimidation factor
so<00:04:23.969> it<00:04:24.120> goes<00:04:24.419> along<00:04:24.690> with

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 
so it goes along with

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:26.649 
so it goes along with
I've<00:04:25.699> already<00:04:25.879> talked<00:04:26.060> about<00:04:26.120> this<00:04:26.330> in<00:04:26.509> like

00:04:26.649 --> 00:04:26.659 
I've already talked about this in like

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:28.270 
I've already talked about this in like
previous<00:04:27.229> videos<00:04:27.530> but<00:04:27.800> you<00:04:27.919> know<00:04:28.009> if<00:04:28.099> you<00:04:28.189> have

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
previous videos but you know if you have

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.700 
previous videos but you know if you have
like<00:04:28.310> maxed<00:04:28.939> out<00:04:29.060> traps<00:04:29.479> and<00:04:29.900> you<00:04:30.289> have<00:04:30.409> a<00:04:30.439> door

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
like maxed out traps and you have a door

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.219 
like maxed out traps and you have a door
with<00:04:30.949> full<00:04:31.219> golden<00:04:31.759> locks<00:04:31.939> then<00:04:32.330> it's<00:04:32.689> making

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:33.229 
with full golden locks then it's making

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:35.679 
with full golden locks then it's making
your<00:04:33.319> base<00:04:33.530> of<00:04:33.800> peri<00:04:34.330> intimidating<00:04:35.330> and<00:04:35.479> just

00:04:35.679 --> 00:04:35.689 
your base of peri intimidating and just

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:37.719 
your base of peri intimidating and just
kind<00:04:35.870> of<00:04:35.900> it<00:04:36.139> might<00:04:36.469> scare<00:04:36.919> your<00:04:37.159> opponents

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:37.729 
kind of it might scare your opponents

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:39.760 
kind of it might scare your opponents
briefly<00:04:38.539> if<00:04:38.810> you're<00:04:39.080> lucky

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
briefly if you're lucky

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.800 
briefly if you're lucky
but<00:04:40.129> overall<00:04:40.340> do<00:04:40.639> I<00:04:40.669> think<00:04:40.789> that<00:04:40.999> the<00:04:41.330> lock

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
but overall do I think that the lock

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:44.140 
but overall do I think that the lock
upgrade<00:04:42.229> was<00:04:42.409> worth<00:04:42.650> upgrading<00:04:42.919> I<00:04:43.550> think<00:04:43.849> yes

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
upgrade was worth upgrading I think yes

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.929 
upgrade was worth upgrading I think yes
I<00:04:44.389> think<00:04:44.419> no<00:04:44.810> yes<00:04:45.529> because<00:04:45.710> you<00:04:46.340> know<00:04:46.490> for<00:04:46.849> the

00:04:46.929 --> 00:04:46.939 
I think no yes because you know for the

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:48.159 
I think no yes because you know for the
most<00:04:47.060> part<00:04:47.210> people<00:04:47.449> aren't<00:04:47.840> attacking<00:04:48.110> my

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169 
most part people aren't attacking my

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:50.409 
most part people aren't attacking my
base<00:04:48.379> and<00:04:48.680> even<00:04:49.129> for<00:04:49.430> the<00:04:49.490> higher<00:04:50.060> level

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:50.419 
base and even for the higher level

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:52.450 
base and even for the higher level
players<00:04:50.569> my<00:04:51.020> gem<00:04:51.379> defense<00:04:51.680> chance<00:04:52.009> is<00:04:52.249> still

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
players my gem defense chance is still

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:53.739 
players my gem defense chance is still
stopping<00:04:53.060> them<00:04:53.210> from<00:04:53.360> actually<00:04:53.479> getting

00:04:53.739 --> 00:04:53.749 
stopping them from actually getting

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:57.339 
stopping them from actually getting
anywhere<00:04:54.169> along<00:04:55.069> with<00:04:55.279> my<00:04:55.550> the<00:04:56.479> traps<00:04:56.779> I<00:04:56.960> place

00:04:57.339 --> 00:04:57.349 
anywhere along with my the traps I place

00:04:57.349 --> 00:04:59.499 
anywhere along with my the traps I place
so<00:04:57.710> you<00:04:57.770> know<00:04:57.979> there's<00:04:58.219> that<00:04:58.460> but<00:04:59.120> it's<00:04:59.300> also

00:04:59.499 --> 00:04:59.509 
so you know there's that but it's also

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:01.899 
so you know there's that but it's also
not<00:04:59.779> worth<00:05:00.020> it<00:05:00.110> just<00:05:00.289> because<00:05:00.529> you<00:05:00.620> know<00:05:00.909> one

00:05:01.899 --> 00:05:01.909 
not worth it just because you know one

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:04.480 
not worth it just because you know one
last<00:05:02.120> thing<00:05:02.449> that<00:05:02.770> you<00:05:03.770> know<00:05:03.860> despite<00:05:04.340> all

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
last thing that you know despite all

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.399 
last thing that you know despite all
these<00:05:04.639> good<00:05:04.969> things<00:05:05.000> with<00:05:05.300> the<00:05:05.419> lock<00:05:05.599> it<00:05:05.870> is

00:05:06.399 --> 00:05:06.409 
these good things with the lock it is

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:08.980 
these good things with the lock it is
very<00:05:06.860> expensive<00:05:07.310> even<00:05:08.029> with<00:05:08.210> a<00:05:08.240> maxed<00:05:08.870> out

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
very expensive even with a maxed out

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.200 
very expensive even with a maxed out
merchants<00:05:09.469> upgrade<00:05:09.680> which<00:05:09.800> I<00:05:09.949> have<00:05:10.189> I've<00:05:10.789> I

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
merchants upgrade which I have I've I

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.619 
merchants upgrade which I have I've I
found<00:05:11.900> myself<00:05:12.080> spending<00:05:12.529> like<00:05:12.830> maybe<00:05:13.629> 100k

00:05:14.619 --> 00:05:14.629 
found myself spending like maybe 100k

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:18.159 
found myself spending like maybe 100k
after<00:05:15.229> like<00:05:15.439> level<00:05:15.770> 20<00:05:16.159> so<00:05:16.490> basically<00:05:17.419> for<00:05:18.050> the

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:18.169 
after like level 20 so basically for the

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:19.869 
after like level 20 so basically for the
next<00:05:18.439> seven<00:05:18.740> levels<00:05:18.949> is<00:05:19.219> about<00:05:19.430> almost<00:05:19.759> like<00:05:19.849> a

00:05:19.869 --> 00:05:19.879 
next seven levels is about almost like a

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:22.929 
next seven levels is about almost like a
million<00:05:20.620> gold<00:05:21.620> that<00:05:21.770> I<00:05:21.830> was<00:05:21.949> spending<00:05:22.279> just<00:05:22.639> to

00:05:22.929 --> 00:05:22.939 
million gold that I was spending just to

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:25.149 
million gold that I was spending just to
fully<00:05:23.749> upgrade<00:05:24.229> this<00:05:24.379> lock<00:05:24.650> upgrade<00:05:25.039> and

00:05:25.149 --> 00:05:25.159 
fully upgrade this lock upgrade and

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:26.529 
fully upgrade this lock upgrade and
that's<00:05:25.219> crazy<00:05:25.639> to<00:05:25.819> me<00:05:25.849> because<00:05:26.029> I<00:05:26.360> know<00:05:26.419> that

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:26.539 
that's crazy to me because I know that

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:28.899 
that's crazy to me because I know that
most<00:05:26.839> people<00:05:27.020> don't<00:05:27.919> actually<00:05:28.129> a<00:05:28.370> max<00:05:28.669> out<00:05:28.849> the

00:05:28.899 --> 00:05:28.909 
most people don't actually a max out the

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:30.010 
most people don't actually a max out the
merchants<00:05:29.210> because<00:05:29.300> they<00:05:29.449> think<00:05:29.509> it's<00:05:29.810> kind

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.020 
merchants because they think it's kind

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.600 
merchants because they think it's kind
of<00:05:30.110> crappy<00:05:30.500> and<00:05:30.800> that's<00:05:31.009> what<00:05:31.129> I<00:05:31.159> thought<00:05:31.400> at

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
of crappy and that's what I thought at

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:34.179 
of crappy and that's what I thought at
first<00:05:31.639> but<00:05:32.210> as<00:05:32.360> you<00:05:32.479> can<00:05:32.599> see<00:05:32.659> a<00:05:33.050> 50%<00:05:33.740> discount

00:05:34.179 --> 00:05:34.189 
first but as you can see a 50% discount

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:36.040 
first but as you can see a 50% discount
is<00:05:34.669> pretty<00:05:35.089> good<00:05:35.270> I<00:05:35.330> think<00:05:35.479> that's<00:05:35.599> also<00:05:35.810> not

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
is pretty good I think that's also not

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.469 
is pretty good I think that's also not
great<00:05:36.169> -<00:05:36.409> I<00:05:36.650> remember<00:05:37.490> that<00:05:37.699> they<00:05:38.180> didn't

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479 
great - I remember that they didn't

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:39.879 
great - I remember that they didn't
actually<00:05:38.659> have<00:05:38.870> the<00:05:39.080> description<00:05:39.379> of<00:05:39.650> what<00:05:39.800> it

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330 
actually did so when you maxed out

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.019 
actually did so when you maxed out
something<00:05:41.810> it<00:05:42.139> just<00:05:42.710> said<00:05:42.979> it<00:05:43.399> just<00:05:43.639> said<00:05:43.789> the
