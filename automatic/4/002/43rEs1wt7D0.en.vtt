this<00:03:30.680> is<00:03:30.830> what<00:03:31.010> I<00:03:31.040> mean<00:03:31.250> about<00:03:31.310> the<00:03:33.220> partially

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
this is what I mean about the partially

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.990 
this is what I mean about the partially
devastated<00:03:34.850> area<00:03:35.209> so<00:03:36.140> all<00:03:36.709> the<00:03:37.190> tree<00:03:37.549> trunks

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
devastated area so all the tree trunks

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.110 
devastated area so all the tree trunks
all<00:03:38.239> knocked<00:03:39.200> over<00:03:39.500> all<00:03:40.220> pointing<00:03:40.970> in<00:03:41.060> the

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
all knocked over all pointing in the

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.190 
all knocked over all pointing in the
same<00:03:41.150> direction<00:03:41.530> towards<00:03:42.530> mountain<00:03:42.980> allen's

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
same direction towards mountain allen's

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.160 
same direction towards mountain allen's
now<00:03:45.200> funky<00:03:46.239> okay<00:03:47.239> here's<00:03:47.510> a<00:03:47.600> fair<00:03:48.019> they

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
now funky okay here's a fair they

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.580 
now funky okay here's a fair they
couldn't<00:03:48.470> telling<00:03:48.739> of<00:03:48.860> the<00:03:48.950> story<00:03:50.049> so<00:03:51.049> the

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
couldn't telling of the story so the

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.759 
couldn't telling of the story so the
blast<00:03:51.890> came<00:03:52.220> over<00:03:52.489> the<00:03:52.580> top<00:03:52.760> of<00:03:52.880> that<00:03:53.000> one

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
blast came over the top of that one

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:56.759 
blast came over the top of that one
trees<00:03:54.769> just<00:03:55.010> behind<00:03:55.340> it<00:03:55.549> got<00:03:55.670> some<00:03:55.850> shelter

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
trees just behind it got some shelter

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.680 
trees just behind it got some shelter
but<00:03:57.769> the<00:03:57.950> ones<00:03:58.160> down<00:03:58.580> in<00:03:58.760> the<00:03:58.880> valley<00:03:59.090> they<00:03:59.480> got

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
but the ones down in the valley they got

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.130 
but the ones down in the valley they got
nothing<00:04:01.060> so<00:04:02.060> if<00:04:02.209> you<00:04:02.330> actually<00:04:02.480> look<00:04:02.690> what

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
nothing so if you actually look what

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.630 
nothing so if you actually look what
you'll<00:04:03.320> find<00:04:03.560> is<00:04:03.799> there's<00:04:04.040> just<00:04:04.250> a<00:04:04.370> load<00:04:04.610> of

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
you'll find is there's just a load of

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.670 
you'll find is there's just a load of
stumps<00:04:06.100> and<00:04:07.100> no<00:04:07.370> sign<00:04:07.790> of<00:04:08.000> any<00:04:08.120> trees<00:04:08.530> then<00:04:09.530> if

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
stumps and no sign of any trees then if

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.550 
stumps and no sign of any trees then if
you<00:04:09.799> come<00:04:09.980> across<00:04:10.220> the<00:04:10.489> valley<00:04:11.230> you<00:04:12.230> start

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
you come across the valley you start

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.910 
you come across the valley you start
finding<00:04:13.600> knocked<00:04:14.600> over<00:04:15.049> trees<00:04:15.230> he's<00:04:15.620> just

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
finding knocked over trees he's just

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.140 
finding knocked over trees he's just
knocked<00:04:16.130> over<00:04:18.310> so<00:04:19.310> the<00:04:19.430> foot<00:04:19.579> blast<00:04:19.850> wasn't

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
knocked over so the foot blast wasn't

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.530 
knocked over so the foot blast wasn't
wasn't<00:04:21.140> like<00:04:21.500> these<00:04:22.160> guys<00:04:22.460> over<00:04:22.850> here<00:04:23.120> where

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 
wasn't like these guys over here where

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.600 
wasn't like these guys over here where
they<00:04:23.660> would<00:04:23.810> just<00:04:23.840> sort<00:04:24.110> of<00:04:24.229> torn<00:04:25.070> off<00:04:25.220> at<00:04:25.400> this

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
they would just sort of torn off at this

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.110 
they would just sort of torn off at this
torn<00:04:26.510> off<00:04:26.630> at<00:04:26.780> the<00:04:26.900> stumps<00:04:27.349> these<00:04:28.280> guys<00:04:28.580> were

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
torn off at the stumps these guys were

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.810 
torn off at the stumps these guys were
just<00:04:29.270> knocked<00:04:29.750> over

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
just knocked over

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.050 
just knocked over
and<00:04:31.350> what<00:04:32.350> you'll<00:04:32.560> find<00:04:32.800> is<00:04:33.100> they<00:04:33.340> they<00:04:33.820> all

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
and what you'll find is they they all

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.350 
and what you'll find is they they all
point<00:04:34.660> like<00:04:34.870> matchsticks<00:04:35.880> to<00:04:36.880> mountain

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
point like matchsticks to mountain

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.820 
point like matchsticks to mountain
allen's<00:04:37.780> and<00:04:39.900> when<00:04:40.900> we<00:04:41.080> get<00:04:41.200> over<00:04:41.350> to<00:04:41.470> the<00:04:41.680> next

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
allen's and when we get over to the next

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.700 
allen's and when we get over to the next
Ridge<00:04:42.430> over<00:04:42.880> you'll<00:04:43.630> find<00:04:43.990> that<00:04:44.500> it's

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
Ridge over you'll find that it's

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:46.350 
Ridge over you'll find that it's
completely<00:04:45.340> littered<00:04:45.670> with<00:04:45.820> just<00:04:46.150> knocked

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
completely littered with just knocked

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.750 
completely littered with just knocked
over<00:04:46.720> trees<00:04:46.930> and<00:04:47.920> then<00:04:48.070> on<00:04:48.160> the<00:04:48.250> ridge<00:04:48.400> after

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
over trees and then on the ridge after

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:51.630 
over trees and then on the ridge after
that<00:04:48.970> you'll<00:04:49.390> find<00:04:49.690> that<00:04:50.050> there<00:04:51.010> are<00:04:51.040> standing

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:51.640 
that you'll find that there are standing

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.030 
that you'll find that there are standing
trees<00:04:51.970> what<00:04:52.210> they're<00:04:52.330> all<00:04:52.420> dead<00:04:52.710> then<00:04:53.710> the

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.040 
trees what they're all dead then the

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.550 
trees what they're all dead then the
result<00:04:54.430> of<00:04:54.550> that<00:04:54.580> you'll<00:04:55.120> find<00:04:55.150> it<00:04:55.600> everything

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560 
result of that you'll find it everything

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.790 
result of that you'll find it everything
is<00:04:56.710> just<00:04:56.920> a<00:04:57.070> woody<00:04:57.340> first<00:04:57.700> that<00:04:57.970> it<00:04:58.090> once<00:04:58.330> was

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
is just a woody first that it once was

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.470 
is just a woody first that it once was
so<00:04:59.800> we<00:04:59.980> come<00:05:00.190> to<00:05:00.340> the<00:05:00.460> last<00:05:00.490> level<00:05:01.120> of<00:05:01.330> the

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:01.480 
so we come to the last level of the

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.550 
so we come to the last level of the
devastation<00:05:02.190> it<00:05:03.190> is<00:05:03.780> even<00:05:04.780> when<00:05:05.080> the<00:05:05.230> slopes

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
devastation it is even when the slopes

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.730 
devastation it is even when the slopes
are<00:05:05.800> pointing<00:05:06.280> the<00:05:06.400> mountain<00:05:06.960> and<00:05:07.960> not

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
are pointing the mountain and not

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.050 
are pointing the mountain and not
completely<00:05:09.400> devastated<00:05:10.150> visa<00:05:10.870> see<00:05:11.530> here

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
completely devastated visa see here

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:14.460 
completely devastated visa see here
there's<00:05:13.060> enough<00:05:13.300> blast<00:05:13.720> to<00:05:14.170> flatten

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
there's enough blast to flatten

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:22.560 
there's enough blast to flatten
everything<00:05:17.250> but<00:05:18.250> just<00:05:18.790> up<00:05:19.450> there<00:05:20.260> like<00:05:21.570> kill

everything but just up there like kill

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:27.930 
everything but just up there like kill
the<00:05:22.750> trees<00:05:23.790> cut<00:05:24.790> all<00:05:25.000> the<00:05:25.120> trees<00:05:26.460> but<00:05:27.460> didn't

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:27.940 
the trees cut all the trees but didn't

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.800 
the trees cut all the trees but didn't
flatten<00:05:28.630> them

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:32.810 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.810
