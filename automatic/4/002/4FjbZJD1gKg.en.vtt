00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:12.139
 the gorgonzola risotto for 4 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.209

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:17.570

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:19.640
 200 g of canton vaud the shame eyes 50 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.099
 g of butter 10 centilitres of white wine 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.619
 a cube of chicken broth 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:26.060
 olive oil and pepper should be 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:27.230
 risotto i will start by doing 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.929
 to heat water in a saucepan 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.849
 for illies to bribe the cube broth this 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:34.870
 will be the broth that will allow us to 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:34.870
 leather risotto 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.130
 while the hot water I prepare the 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.200
 aromatic garnish so I'm going 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:45.130
 chop the onion and then sautÃ© 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.130
 in half the butter 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.720
 I add a trickle of oil that will allow 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.120
 in butter not to burn I leave 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:06.300
 cook the onions for about two 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.100
 minutes before adding the rice and there I 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.710
 let it cook, stirring well so that 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.930
 all the grains of rice are covered by 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.340
 bastia thanks and when the rice is 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.880
 translucent it takes about two 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.500
 minutes game of ice cream with white wine 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.630
 I let the white wine evaporate 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.190
 then that's where will start and 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.020
 the whole principle of risotto ie 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.290
 we will add the hot broth 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.300
 louche by lou and the idea is 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.009
 to wait for the rice and butt or the 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.369
 broth before adding another 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.930
 ladle to another thing 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.460
 this is to a new best friend 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.250
 for the risotto since it will take 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.149
 but constantly support are gradually 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.040
 15 to 17 minutes for a risotto 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.840
 it's been 17 minutes since I added 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.670
 broth and I turn I will taste 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.680
 to see to check if the grain of 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:58.649
 rice is cooked it's perfect it's cooked 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:04.170
 still very very slightly crunchy at 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:04.830
 heart it's going to be the moment to add the 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.830
 final touch 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:11.479
 Gorgonzola and butter for 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.479
 creamy yes yes you heard me 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.910
 I add a pinch of pepper and I 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.070
 tastes to possibly season in 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.080
 salt not between us between gorgonzola and 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:37.220
 the broth this should be enough 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:39.860
 salty but do we ever know the risotto at 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.870
 gorgonzola is ready he is very creamy 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.700
 and you have to taste it while it's 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.709
 hot if you want to see another 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.160
