00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
and the weight is 4 units so overall

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.140

thing<00:01:46.820> it<00:01:47.600> doesn't<00:01:47.930> really<00:01:48.170> give<00:01:48.470> you<00:01:48.590> too

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860

much<00:01:49.159> of<00:01:49.220> a<00:01:49.490> bonus<00:01:49.880> I<00:01:50.060> only<00:01:50.960> noticed<00:01:51.350> the

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
much of a bonus I only noticed the

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.030 
much of a bonus I only noticed the
difference<00:01:51.920> of<00:01:52.070> about<00:01:52.190> 20<00:01:52.940> damage<00:01:53.299> or<00:01:53.630> so

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
difference of about 20 damage or so

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.170 
difference of about 20 damage or so
against<00:01:55.040> certain<00:01:55.490> enemies<00:01:55.760> when<00:01:55.909> I<00:01:55.939> was<00:01:56.090> doing

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
against certain enemies when I was doing

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.149 
against certain enemies when I was doing
the<00:01:56.390> testing<00:01:56.750> but<00:01:57.439> you<00:01:57.680> know<00:01:57.799> every<00:01:58.130> little

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
the testing but you know every little

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:00.010 
the testing but you know every little
bit<00:01:58.460> helps<00:01:58.520> and<00:01:58.970> I'm<00:01:59.330> not<00:01:59.510> going<00:01:59.689> to<00:01:59.750> complain

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
bit helps and I'm not going to complain

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.140 
bit helps and I'm not going to complain
so<00:02:00.890> it's<00:02:01.610> probably<00:02:02.000> giving<00:02:02.270> me<00:02:02.420> a<00:02:02.750> I<00:02:04.150> don't

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
so it's probably giving me a I don't

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.929 
so it's probably giving me a I don't
know<00:02:05.299> I'm<00:02:05.540> not<00:02:05.600> exactly<00:02:06.409> sure<00:02:06.890> how<00:02:07.189> defences

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:07.939 
know I'm not exactly sure how defences

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:09.669 
know I'm not exactly sure how defences
and<00:02:08.060> everything<00:02:08.390> work<00:02:08.539> I<00:02:08.720> can't<00:02:08.989> exactly<00:02:09.319> say

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
and everything work I can't exactly say

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.920 
and everything work I can't exactly say
I'm<00:02:10.280> not<00:02:10.429> sure<00:02:10.670> if<00:02:10.939> it's<00:02:11.120> a<00:02:11.180> percentage<00:02:11.629> based

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
I'm not sure if it's a percentage based

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.119 
I'm not sure if it's a percentage based
thing<00:02:12.349> or<00:02:12.590> what

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:13.129 
thing or what

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:17.140 
thing or what
so<00:02:13.810> all<00:02:14.810> I'm<00:02:15.230> gonna<00:02:15.739> say<00:02:15.980> is<00:02:16.040> it<00:02:16.459> does<00:02:16.670> give<00:02:16.970> you

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
so all I'm gonna say is it does give you

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.589 
so all I'm gonna say is it does give you
a<00:02:17.180> bonus<00:02:17.680> to<00:02:18.680> your<00:02:18.889> damage<00:02:19.249> output<00:02:19.400> not<00:02:20.359> too

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
a bonus to your damage output not too

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.110 
a bonus to your damage output not too
much<00:02:20.870> of<00:02:21.019> a<00:02:21.109> bonus<00:02:21.469> but<00:02:21.980> it<00:02:22.219> is<00:02:22.459> still<00:02:22.760> that

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
much of a bonus but it is still that

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.440 
much of a bonus but it is still that
now<00:02:24.050> as<00:02:24.319> you've<00:02:24.560> noticed<00:02:24.950> a<00:02:25.129> few<00:02:25.430> times<00:02:25.700> my<00:02:26.090> r2

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
now as you've noticed a few times my r2

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.240 
now as you've noticed a few times my r2
attacks<00:02:26.810> are<00:02:27.050> kind<00:02:27.470> of<00:02:27.560> interesting<00:02:28.099> one

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
attacks are kind of interesting one

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.869 
attacks are kind of interesting one
one-handed<00:02:28.879> they<00:02:29.510> spin<00:02:30.410> the<00:02:31.069> tip<00:02:31.550> of<00:02:31.700> the

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:31.879 
one-handed they spin the tip of the

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:36.160 
one-handed they spin the tip of the
spear<00:02:32.480> spins<00:02:33.050> and<00:02:33.670> that<00:02:34.670> causes<00:02:35.239> a<00:02:35.510> few<00:02:35.989> things

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
spear spins and that causes a few things

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.930 
spear spins and that causes a few things
to<00:02:36.319> happen<00:02:36.440> first<00:02:36.830> off<00:02:37.010> it<00:02:37.220> causes<00:02:37.610> the<00:02:37.790> damage

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
to happen first off it causes the damage

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.979 
to happen first off it causes the damage
to<00:02:38.300> build<00:02:38.540> up<00:02:38.750> for<00:02:39.590> every<00:02:39.950> time<00:02:40.160> it<00:02:40.280> spins<00:02:40.640> and

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
to build up for every time it spins and

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.270 
to build up for every time it spins and
second<00:02:41.989> because<00:02:42.290> of<00:02:42.530> the<00:02:42.620> way<00:02:42.709> poise<00:02:43.010> is

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
second because of the way poise is

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.400 
second because of the way poise is
working<00:02:43.640> at<00:02:43.730> the<00:02:43.819> moment<00:02:43.849> it<00:02:44.390> stuns<00:02:45.200> the

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
working at the moment it stuns the

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.400 
working at the moment it stuns the
opponent<00:02:45.890> and<00:02:46.360> catches<00:02:47.360> them<00:02:47.540> in<00:02:47.750> the<00:02:47.930> spin<00:02:48.230> if

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
opponent and catches them in the spin if

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:49.809 
opponent and catches them in the spin if
you<00:02:48.500> have<00:02:48.650> them<00:02:48.769> once<00:02:48.980> you<00:02:49.160> hit<00:02:49.250> them<00:02:49.459> three

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 
you have them once you hit them three

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:52.630 
you have them once you hit them three
times<00:02:49.970> and<00:02:50.810> that's<00:02:50.900> a<00:02:51.080> very<00:02:51.349> very<00:02:51.769> good<00:02:51.950> thing

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
times and that's a very very good thing

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.400 
times and that's a very very good thing
for<00:02:52.819> this<00:02:53.090> weapon<00:02:53.420> because<00:02:53.720> it<00:02:53.750> makes<00:02:54.019> it<00:02:54.110> easy

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
for this weapon because it makes it easy

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.160 
for this weapon because it makes it easy
to<00:02:54.769> build<00:02:54.890> up<00:02:55.130> damage<00:02:55.549> despite<00:02:56.269> having<00:02:56.660> a<00:02:56.930> low

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
to build up damage despite having a low

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.190 
to build up damage despite having a low
attack<00:02:57.709> rating<00:02:58.010> and<00:02:58.370> low<00:02:58.519> damage<00:02:58.790> output<00:02:59.200> per

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
attack rating and low damage output per

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.710 
attack rating and low damage output per
attack<00:03:00.920> I<00:03:01.130> mean<00:03:01.160> against<00:03:02.150> this<00:03:02.360> guy<00:03:02.540> I'm

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:02.720 
attack I mean against this guy I'm

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.759 
attack I mean against this guy I'm
hitting<00:03:03.099> like<00:03:04.099> hundreds<00:03:04.700> and<00:03:04.880> my<00:03:05.870> 1r2<00:03:06.260> did<00:03:06.680> it

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
hitting like hundreds and my 1r2 did it

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.550 
hitting like hundreds and my 1r2 did it
right<00:03:06.890> around<00:03:07.750> 490<00:03:08.750> I<00:03:08.780> think<00:03:09.019> is<00:03:09.110> what<00:03:09.260> an<00:03:09.379> end

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
right around 490 I think is what an end

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.030 
right around 490 I think is what an end
of<00:03:09.680> that<00:03:09.829> so<00:03:10.579> it<00:03:10.940> builds<00:03:11.299> up<00:03:11.480> very<00:03:11.900> nicely<00:03:12.200> the

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
of that so it builds up very nicely the

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.420 
of that so it builds up very nicely the
rolling<00:03:13.370> attacks<00:03:13.670> also<00:03:14.209> spin<00:03:14.720> and<00:03:15.190> you<00:03:16.190> want

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
rolling attacks also spin and you want

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.069 
rolling attacks also spin and you want
to<00:03:16.549> hit<00:03:16.700> your<00:03:16.849> opponent<00:03:16.910> with<00:03:17.390> just<00:03:17.750> the<00:03:17.900> tip

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
to hit your opponent with just the tip

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:19.509 
to hit your opponent with just the tip
so<00:03:18.290> you<00:03:18.379> can<00:03:18.500> get<00:03:18.620> them<00:03:18.739> with<00:03:18.890> a<00:03:18.920> little<00:03:19.129> spin

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
so you can get them with a little spin

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:23.170 
so you can get them with a little spin
move<00:03:19.549> and<00:03:20.200> that<00:03:21.200> is<00:03:21.410> a<00:03:21.470> good<00:03:22.160> thing<00:03:22.310> it<00:03:22.519> that's

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
move and that is a good thing it that's

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.930 
move and that is a good thing it that's
a<00:03:23.269> good<00:03:23.420> time<00:03:23.599> for<00:03:23.840> you<00:03:23.989> that's<00:03:24.590> so<00:03:24.879> good<00:03:25.879> for

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
a good time for you that's so good for

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.240 
a good time for you that's so good for
your<00:03:26.269> opponent<00:03:26.690> but<00:03:27.019> it<00:03:27.350> makes<00:03:27.769> good<00:03:28.040> things

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
your opponent but it makes good things

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.479 
your opponent but it makes good things
happen<00:03:29.019> so<00:03:30.019> I<00:03:30.319> would<00:03:30.620> have<00:03:30.709> to<00:03:30.829> say<00:03:31.040> that<00:03:31.370> the

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
happen so I would have to say that the

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:33.280 
happen so I would have to say that the
biggest<00:03:31.700> pro<00:03:32.239> of<00:03:32.540> this<00:03:32.870> weapon

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
biggest pro of this weapon

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.009 
biggest pro of this weapon
would<00:03:34.069> probably<00:03:34.970> be<00:03:35.180> the<00:03:35.389> r2<00:03:35.720> attacks

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
would probably be the r2 attacks

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.050 
would probably be the r2 attacks
actually<00:03:36.290> now<00:03:37.160> a<00:03:37.190> lot<00:03:37.549> of<00:03:37.579> people<00:03:37.880> would

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
actually now a lot of people would

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.900 
actually now a lot of people would
probably<00:03:38.180> say<00:03:38.420> that<00:03:38.750> it's<00:03:38.870> the<00:03:39.170> r2<00:03:40.099> when<00:03:40.609> you

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
probably say that it's the r2 when you

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.870 
probably say that it's the r2 when you
are<00:03:41.239> to<00:03:41.930> handing<00:03:42.319> it<00:03:42.440> to<00:03:42.590> give<00:03:43.459> yourself<00:03:43.760> a

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
are to handing it to give yourself a

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.080 
are to handing it to give yourself a
buff<00:03:44.060> and<00:03:44.299> to<00:03:44.359> give<00:03:44.480> your<00:03:44.660> allies<00:03:44.930> a<00:03:44.959> buff<00:03:45.230> I<00:03:45.410> am

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
buff and to give your allies a buff I am

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.729 
buff and to give your allies a buff I am
sure<00:03:47.090> a<00:03:47.420> lot<00:03:47.450> of<00:03:47.660> people<00:03:47.810> would<00:03:48.079> say<00:03:48.260> that<00:03:48.410> that

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
sure a lot of people would say that that

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:51.009 
sure a lot of people would say that that
is<00:03:48.950> the<00:03:48.980> biggest<00:03:49.280> Pro<00:03:49.609> but<00:03:50.299> it<00:03:50.569> doesn't<00:03:50.900> really

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
is the biggest Pro but it doesn't really

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:52.900 
is the biggest Pro but it doesn't really
do<00:03:51.319> too<00:03:51.500> much<00:03:51.680> for<00:03:51.980> you<00:03:52.069> this<00:03:52.190> time<00:03:52.250> around<00:03:52.639> it

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
do too much for you this time around it

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.940 
do too much for you this time around it
might<00:03:53.510> do<00:03:53.630> more<00:03:53.810> for<00:03:54.049> your<00:03:54.109> allies<00:03:54.500> I<00:03:54.680> didn't

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
might do more for your allies I didn't

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.009 
might do more for your allies I didn't
actually<00:03:55.130> have<00:03:55.669> a<00:03:55.700> chance<00:03:55.910> to<00:03:56.209> test<00:03:56.510> how<00:03:56.989> well

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
actually have a chance to test how well

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:01.300 
actually have a chance to test how well
it<00:03:57.440> works<00:03:57.650> for<00:03:58.010> them<00:03:58.419> but<00:03:59.769> I'm<00:04:00.769> assuming<00:04:01.040> it

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
it works for them but I'm assuming it

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.879 
it works for them but I'm assuming it
would<00:04:01.430> work<00:04:01.579> very<00:04:02.120> well<00:04:02.239> for<00:04:02.660> them<00:04:02.889> probably

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:03.889 
would work very well for them probably

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:05.500 
would work very well for them probably
similar<00:04:04.130> to<00:04:04.280> how<00:04:04.489> it<00:04:04.639> did<00:04:04.669> in<00:04:04.880> Dark<00:04:05.120> Souls<00:04:05.359> I

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
similar to how it did in Dark Souls I

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.690 
similar to how it did in Dark Souls I
mean<00:04:05.660> I'm<00:04:06.410> sure<00:04:06.739> they<00:04:06.950> can't<00:04:07.220> give<00:04:07.370> you<00:04:07.459> too

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
mean I'm sure they can't give you too

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.069 
mean I'm sure they can't give you too
much<00:04:07.880> of<00:04:07.940> a<00:04:08.120> personal<00:04:08.450> buff<00:04:08.660> because<00:04:08.780> then

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:09.079 
much of a personal buff because then

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:10.270 
much of a personal buff because then
you'd<00:04:09.230> be<00:04:09.349> able<00:04:09.440> to<00:04:09.560> combine<00:04:09.709> too<00:04:10.130> many

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:10.280 
you'd be able to combine too many

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.370 
you'd be able to combine too many
different<00:04:10.700> personal<00:04:11.120> buffs<00:04:11.450> with<00:04:11.840> this<00:04:12.109> thing

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
different personal buffs with this thing

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.810 
different personal buffs with this thing
and<00:04:12.709> that'd<00:04:13.549> be<00:04:13.579> that'd<00:04:13.970> be<00:04:14.090> scary<00:04:14.150> but<00:04:15.820> it

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
and that'd be that'd be scary but it

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:18.310 
and that'd be that'd be scary but it
still<00:04:17.180> is<00:04:17.359> something<00:04:17.570> and<00:04:17.900> that's<00:04:18.019> still

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
still is something and that's still

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.259 
still is something and that's still
worth<00:04:18.470> mentioning<00:04:18.620> but<00:04:19.250> yet<00:04:19.549> the<00:04:19.789> biggest<00:04:19.970> Pro

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
worth mentioning but yet the biggest Pro

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.200 
worth mentioning but yet the biggest Pro
definitely<00:04:20.780> be<00:04:20.900> the<00:04:21.019> one-handed<00:04:21.530> r2<00:04:22.310> and<00:04:22.580> the

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
definitely be the one-handed r2 and the

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.000 
definitely be the one-handed r2 and the
rolling<00:04:23.510> attacks<00:04:23.840> because<00:04:24.349> of<00:04:24.380> the<00:04:24.590> little

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
rolling attacks because of the little

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.620 
rolling attacks because of the little
spin<00:04:25.310> move<00:04:25.340> that<00:04:25.729> you<00:04:25.820> got<00:04:26.000> going<00:04:26.180> with<00:04:26.479> it

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
spin move that you got going with it

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.719 
spin move that you got going with it
that<00:04:27.260> can<00:04:27.440> stun<00:04:27.770> your<00:04:27.889> opponent<00:04:28.310> and<00:04:28.430> cause

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:28.729 
that can stun your opponent and cause

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:32.500 
that can stun your opponent and cause
the<00:04:29.120> damage<00:04:29.870> to<00:04:30.169> build<00:04:30.380> up<00:04:30.530> very<00:04:30.979> very<00:04:31.070> fast<00:04:31.510> so

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
the damage to build up very very fast so

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.320 
the damage to build up very very fast so
that's<00:04:32.840> a<00:04:33.080> good<00:04:33.440> thing

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
that's a good thing

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.050 
that's a good thing
the<00:04:34.720> biggest<00:04:34.990> con<00:04:35.440> of<00:04:35.770> the<00:04:35.950> weapon<00:04:36.280> I'd<00:04:36.880> have

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
the biggest con of the weapon I'd have

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.330 
the biggest con of the weapon I'd have
to<00:04:37.150> say<00:04:37.330> is<00:04:37.600> probably<00:04:37.960> a<00:04:38.080> tie<00:04:38.260> between<00:04:38.530> the<00:04:39.010> low

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
to say is probably a tie between the low

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.170 
to say is probably a tie between the low
damage<00:04:39.610> output<00:04:39.970> and<00:04:40.810> the<00:04:41.440> fact<00:04:41.710> that<00:04:42.010> the<00:04:42.910> only

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
damage output and the fact that the only

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.730 
damage output and the fact that the only
way<00:04:43.330> to<00:04:43.390> get<00:04:43.570> this<00:04:43.690> weapon<00:04:43.870> is<00:04:44.170> by<00:04:44.380> creating

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
way to get this weapon is by creating

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.620 
way to get this weapon is by creating
with<00:04:45.100> the<00:04:45.310> crows<00:04:45.640> and<00:04:45.670> you<00:04:46.060> need<00:04:46.210> to<00:04:46.330> trade

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
with the crows and you need to trade

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.260 
with the crows and you need to trade
