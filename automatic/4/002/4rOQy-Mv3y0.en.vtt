 portable console 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.300
 a small console that I appreciate 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.200
 a lot and that I will make you 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:31.540

 usually a little word anyway on 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:47.800
 this console which is an output console 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:50.140
 exclusively in the pokemon center at 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.500

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:56.590

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.660
 2005 so also you see the 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.790
 red colors of the console that is 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.290
 released on the occasion of a pokemon dungeon 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.310
 mystery among other rescue teams 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.900
 red 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.430
 the blue version on ds came out on 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:10.270
 same day too it seems to me that it was 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:12.310
 November 17, 2005 from memory excuse if 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.540
 I'm wrong but the colors of the 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.729
 console it's true it was rather 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.920
 to honor red rescue teams 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:19.689
 on game boy advance and discover we have 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.189
 right away at the non anyway a 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:23.649
 little word first on the packaging that I 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:25.390
 still pretty pretty with the 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:26.289
 starters of the first three generation 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.719
 pokemon 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:30.310
 they are well cute there all together and 

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:32.619
 tell me what is your favorite among 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.939
 all those there and there is an intruder by but 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:35.439
 all this is obviously it's 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:37.210
 pikachu which is in the middle at 

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:39.130
 center it's true it's not the 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.069
 pokemon mascot for nothing because 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:46.240
 this one he's really everywhere at the 

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:47.280
 now find out what's hidden in 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.740
 interior 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.539
 if I can open it, I'll do it 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.979
 otherwise I have more the side this really 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:59.200
 not fancy the bim and this one here I 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.609
 I'll take out everything you have 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.229
 imagine what is in the small 

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:05.259
 black pouch 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:08.020
 this is going to be the records again a 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.490
 small white packaging not to charge 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:13.120
 in this one it's true that I had to 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:17.080
 buy the charger report these are the 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:19.209
 records we know that his date this also a 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.970
 couturier center online with numbers 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.560
 phone and date 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.000
 another note here if it's to do 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.640
 the promo of some games 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:34.660
 apparently on the game boy illico here 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:38.020
 I here another yachting in jap and 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.740
 this is our most complete notice 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:44.110
 about using the console 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.370
 and a little black pouch nothing 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.870
 all that's a pity it's true they 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.540
 could have added a little drawing 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.010
 like the game boy light 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:55.270
 this is a small certified pouch 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:59.320
 nintendo game boy micro and watch out 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.770
 better for the end the console so the 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.480
 here is 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.860
 that's what she looks like 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.330
 micro wave game boy it's true she 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:08.260
 is really small back compare them 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:10.600
 to mama what that gives the black with 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.420
 still a little artwork here from pikachu 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:16.780
 and obviously a keys that 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:19.690
 are black and all around it's red 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.220
 so there the button to turn it on 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.430
 so she works well of her too 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:28.150
 nickel that will extinguish it have placed it for 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:32.190
 turn it on here is the volume on the 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:35.410
 side the buttons l and r which are in gray 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.280
 and the back is a beautiful logo of the 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.209
 pokemon center 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.860
 the release date of the console and for 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.810
 put the game in fact it's down so 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.299
 the game was provided with the console that 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.660
 I bought these pokemon of fire and 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:51.459
 in the English version 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.080
 so here and it's still games 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.660
 so that it's really a small 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.519
 console but still nice 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.560
 really pretty and syrte buttons 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:02.260
 select and start that are here 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.250
 I forgot to talk about them so 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.640
 it's a console anyway that is 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.110
 really cute and they did 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.840
 the effort bag to add a small artwork 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:13.000
 but unfortunately not enough 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.790
 It is true that apart from the small logo 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.229
 here he has pokéball from the pokémon center to a 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.299
 little logo I'm not doing something here 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:22.450
 an artwork the camera would have been more 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.290
 nice but good at the same time one otherwise 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.840
 it's true that it's still 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:28.240
 console that is quite rare and worth 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.800
 presently very expensive as 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.590
 some consoles it's true at the same 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.440
 time 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.490
 the releases in 2005 is no edition 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.400
 very limited 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:39.770
 and that's it's over and then I 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.650
 you still admire one last 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.120
 times the console closer and I had 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.920
 forgot to mention it too it's true 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.770
 that it's the only micro game boy 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.120
 pokemon edition that was created so 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.130
 that a little gem anyway even a 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.840
 times for the collection despite that as 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:55.490
 I said it still lacks 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.930
 little things and that the traces of 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.130
 fingers on the other hand it's really deadly 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.440
 on his consoles and it shows 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:02.180
 unfortunately very well on screen and 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.620
 on this I tell you very soon for 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.620
 a new console presentation
