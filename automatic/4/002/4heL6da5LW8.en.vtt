00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:06.870
 Good Morning everyone friends 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.900
 today I want to show you a model between 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:14.070
 the simplest that the victorinox has 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.910
 never produced and is a very model 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.650
 particular 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:22.800
 we are talking about the excelsior model 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:24.600
 I don't know if you've ever seen it 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:30.779
 bought new on the internet 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:33.620
 and well because when you can 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.230
 use a model like this 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:39.300
 this as you can see a model from 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.670
 74 mm therefore it is an intermediate measure 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.460
 we say there are many knives that 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:50.250
 they have the 74 mm size they have 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:52.739
 not many products but this one 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.280
 I really like it a lot 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:01:00.329
 I'll show you this beautiful 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:02.699
 Satin aluminum finish is a 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.610
 semi- glossy brushed aluminum or 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:10.439
 practically satin-finished with 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:16.080
 rivets in polished steel is fine 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:18.210
 as you can see the red ok badge is from the 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.530
 opposite side is completely smooth and 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:26.280
 then satin-finished with very few finishes 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:31.040
 but this design with this design 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:34.439
 oval gives it in my opinion a 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:37.409
 elegance that among all the models of the 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:41.299
 victorinox is perhaps what stands out of 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.499
 more in terms of elegance 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:45.869
 to the blades that I will now show you 

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:48.450
 because this knife obviously has 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.929
 as you can imagine from the thickness 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.119
 which is really very very thin and has 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:57.810
 therefore an extremely reduced weight 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:00.439
 this weighs just 24 grams so it's a 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:04.289
 really really light knife 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:07.890
 extremely pocket-sized has no 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:10.920
 extremely thin type of footprint 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:16.079
 the tools are only two like 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:23.579
 we can imagine and with a blade more 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:27.480
 great standard that is very sharp it 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:29.819
 thickness is rather reduced therefore 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:33.180
 obviously the thread will be rather 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:35.280
 sharp is safe 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.629
 I can guarantee you size with extreme 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.970
 easiness 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:42.329
 on the other side we have the 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:45.450
 smaller blade so we have another 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:47.819
 blade that we find this is the same 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.980
 blade that is mounted precisely on 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.980
 knives be it from 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:03:02.150
 knives much smaller even from the 54 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:05.330
 mm I think the apple is mounted me 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.750
 much smaller are much more 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:14.530
 thin so the thread is even more 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:14.530
 very very sharp cutting edge 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:21.250
 well let's say this one is a second here 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.250
 my point of view then of course 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.650
 obviously everyone thinks like that 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.040
 wants 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:33.280
 it's a knife you can carry around 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:33.280
 we say in circumstances not only of 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:38.300
 let's say as functionality but also 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:41.030
 just like aesthetics 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:43.520
 this is not a simple knife but 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:48.200
 we say that for those who need but know of 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:50.780
 open a letter or or we say have no 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.450
 I know I need an hour but this 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.959
 knife also respects a design that 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:59.540
 I think it has its own elegance 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:02.330
 think about it maybe i do n't know let's do a 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:06.580
 certain job we have 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:06.580
 need a knife or a paper cutter 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:13.520
 but we are always traveling and maybe 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:16.760
 for work reasons we also tend to 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:19.070
 have a look or dress in 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.109
 certain ways in we also talk about 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:25.620
 a person who dresses elegantly perhaps 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:27.960
 he also eats a tie and in my opinion 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:32.990
 maybe even for a person who dresses 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:40.590
 elegant to have an accessory like this 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:41.430
 well it is very pretty in my opinion it has its own 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.580
 why 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:50.030
 surely the form is very striking 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:50.030
 oval because it is really very pretty and 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:56.070
 despite having only as you see two 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:05:00.389
 blades that can certainly be used 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:04.010
 for various ways but also with how 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:08.820
 I repeat like a simple open letter o 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:11.699
 in short, jobs of various kinds 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:15.060
 let's say he has a finish e 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:19.370
 an elegance that anyway can arouse 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:21.870
 also the curiosity of people who maybe 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:25.289
 for work they must dress in a manner 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:29.039
 elegant and have an accessory like 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:32.250
 this behind makes the difference we say 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:34.830
 which has its charm can be beautiful 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:39.030
 having an object like this is to keep in 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:42.460
 pocket an elegant object that 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:45.699
 when you see it live 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:48.910
 I think it makes a lot of sense the idea is like a 

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:51.820
 piece that stands out from the classics 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:54.160
 Victorian forms 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:59.050
 as you see at the ring so it can be 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:06:02.320
 quietly tied to the pants with 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:05.110
 a chain even if it is a maybe 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:07.120
 the chain is a little too showy but a 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:10.600
 sometimes even with a simple note 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:13.720
 of leather or a chain maybe of 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:16.060
 much smaller size in silver 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:20.010
 or with a finish that fits 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:23.680
 however with the elegant design of the knife 

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:26.320
 it's a knife anyway rather 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:29.050
 I think I don't want to come cheap 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:31.860
 I'm wrong but I think it's from 10 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:33.699
 at 15 euros therefore extremely 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:36.610
 cheap 

00:06:33.699 --> 00:06:40.150
 this surely I propose to you again 

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:41.949
 open as you see when you click on one 

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:46.320
 single spring 

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:51.370
 obviously two are expected 

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:55.090
 very simple plans and so I will 

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:57.180
 I advise those who want an object not 

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:59.680
 only 

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:01.990
 who we say points not only to 

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:06.670
 functionality that always remains 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:08.980
 despite having a small size e 

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:11.080
 however still a victorinox and vi 

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:14.620
 I guarantee that the mechanics is excellent e 

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:18.850
 the blades are obviously always theirs 

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:22.330
 who wants a tool that can be 

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:27.280
 functional even if with few tools but 

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:31.390
 which has a particular elegance of form 

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:33.730
 very very elegant very pretty and of 

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:37.030
 rather small memory size is 

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:41.340
 an extremely heavy 74 mm 

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:43.960
 reduced just 24 grams then 

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:46.030
 extremely simple and easy to 

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:47.200
 bring you can safely keep in 

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:49.240
 pocket 

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:50.460
 who wants an object to stand out 

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:53.770
 from the mass 

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:55.440
 surely this is the object that can 

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:58.000
 do for you 

00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:01.120
 I hope you enjoy the review 

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.220
 liked tell me what you think 

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:06.570
 if you have questions as always 

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:09.550
 you know you can safely email me 

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:11.980
 having said that we will feel for the 

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:14.610
 next video and it's next review 

00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:14.610
 Hello
