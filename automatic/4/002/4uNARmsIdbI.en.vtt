 if you like to tell us what we can

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.400
 computer but good calm that already 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:38.380

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.670

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.640
 the comments 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.830
 because juanillo and I can do 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:14.560
 any madness the truth is that these 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:16.120
 Pretty pathetic games but in short 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:20.610

 but there will be enough man here 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.080
 and it's true that I thought that this was 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.870
 stone but that you go is child's sand 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.110
 sand you can build nothing with sand 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.110
 10 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.250

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.110
 children 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.100
 nothing is going to take me here here here 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.430
 stone this is so you have to be 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.430
