00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
which is really just a broken pot if you

you can just use a large stone big
enough<00:00:44.340> to<00:00:44.489> cover<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.910> hole<00:00:45.090> in<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.420> bottom

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
enough to cover the hole in the bottom

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.810 
enough to cover the hole in the bottom
of<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:45.960> pot<00:00:46.170> without<00:00:46.860> blocking<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:47.460> up<00:00:47.610> you

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
of the pot without blocking it up you

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.310 
of the pot without blocking it up you
want<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.090> make<00:00:48.239> sure<00:00:48.270> that<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.750> water<00:00:48.930> can

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
want to make sure that the water can

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.119 
want to make sure that the water can
still<00:00:49.590> get<00:00:49.739> out

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
still get out

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.470 
still get out
place<00:00:50.969> your<00:00:51.210> chard<00:00:51.480> over<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.260> hole<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:53.480> start

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
place your chard over the hole and start

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.680 
place your chard over the hole and start
adding<00:00:54.809> some<00:00:54.930> soil<00:00:55.550> now<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:56.820> have<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.059> variety<00:00:57.449> of

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
adding some soil now I have a variety of

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.599 
adding some soil now I have a variety of
sizes<00:00:58.020> of<00:00:58.379> plants<00:00:58.770> here<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:59.010> couple<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.460> them

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
sizes of plants here a couple of them

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.819 
sizes of plants here a couple of them
are<00:00:59.789> quite<00:00:59.910> large<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.780> some<00:01:01.410> of<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.590> others

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
are quite large and some of the others

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.799 
are quite large and some of the others
are<00:01:01.949> small<00:01:02.250> so<00:01:02.760> I'm<00:01:02.910> not<00:01:03.030> gonna<00:01:03.180> add<00:01:03.390> too<00:01:03.660> much

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
are small so I'm not gonna add too much

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.770 
are small so I'm not gonna add too much
soil<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.439> bottom<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:05.100> chose<00:01:05.700> of<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:06.030> potting

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
soil to the bottom I chose of a potting

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.990 
soil to the bottom I chose of a potting
soil<00:01:07.080> that<00:01:07.530> has<00:01:07.710> fertilizer<00:01:08.250> already<00:01:08.700> in<00:01:08.850> it

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
soil that has fertilizer already in it

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.310 
soil that has fertilizer already in it
so<00:01:09.510> I<00:01:09.540> don't<00:01:09.780> have<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.049> worry<00:01:10.229> about

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
so I don't have to worry about

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.750 
so I don't have to worry about
fertilizing<00:01:13.100> now<00:01:14.100> that<00:01:14.340> looks<00:01:14.520> like<00:01:14.640> about

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
fertilizing now that looks like about

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.420 
fertilizing now that looks like about
enough<00:01:15.119> I'm<00:01:15.720> gonna<00:01:15.900> start<00:01:16.290> with<00:01:17.040> one<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.310> the

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
enough I'm gonna start with one of the

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.210 
enough I'm gonna start with one of the
big<00:01:17.580> plants<00:01:18.080> give<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.229> pot<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.680> couple<00:01:19.740> of

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
big plants give the pot a couple of

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.100 
big plants give the pot a couple of
squeezes<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:20.970> loosen<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.420> plant<00:01:21.659> in<00:01:21.930> it<00:01:24.110> there

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
squeezes to loosen the plant in it there

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.890 
squeezes to loosen the plant in it there
you<00:01:25.259> go<00:01:25.460> this<00:01:26.460> is<00:01:26.520> pretty<00:01:26.700> root<00:01:27.119> bound<00:01:27.330> so<00:01:27.750> I'm

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
you go this is pretty root bound so I'm

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.350 
you go this is pretty root bound so I'm
gonna<00:01:27.990> have<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.350> tear<00:01:28.650> it<00:01:28.680> up<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:29.009> bit<00:01:29.360> making

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
gonna have to tear it up a bit making

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.679 
gonna have to tear it up a bit making
sure<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.930> get<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.950> roots<00:01:32.180> help<00:01:33.590> and<00:01:34.590> place<00:01:34.950> it

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
sure to get the roots help and place it

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:38.929 
sure to get the roots help and place it
placing<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:36.810> carefully<00:01:37.490> look<00:01:38.490> for<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.759> best

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
placing it carefully look for the best

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.840 
placing it carefully look for the best
angle<00:01:39.509> in<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.869> plant<00:01:40.140> make<00:01:40.470> sure<00:01:40.710> that's<00:01:40.920> in

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
angle in the plant make sure that's in

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.340 
angle in the plant make sure that's in
the<00:01:42.060> direction<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.720> focal<00:01:43.079> point<00:01:43.259> that

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
the direction of the focal point that

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.350 
the direction of the focal point that
you're<00:01:43.560> going<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.920> be<00:01:44.850> looking<00:01:45.149> at<00:01:45.270> the

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
you're going to be looking at the

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.050 
you're going to be looking at the
planter<00:01:45.960> from<00:01:46.610> needs<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.700> little<00:01:47.850> bit<00:01:48.000> more

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
planter from needs a little bit more

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.859 
planter from needs a little bit more
soil<00:01:48.450> underneath<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:50.420> you<00:01:51.420> want<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.720> make<00:01:51.840> sure

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
soil underneath it you want to make sure

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.170 
soil underneath it you want to make sure
that<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.470> level<00:01:52.799> of<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:52.950> soil<00:01:53.250> is<00:01:53.610> about<00:01:54.060> a

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
that the level of the soil is about a

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.749 
that the level of the soil is about a
half<00:01:54.479> an<00:01:54.720> inch<00:01:54.899> below<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:56.070> level<00:01:56.369> of<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.460> pot

half an inch below the level of the pot

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.639 
half an inch below the level of the pot
so<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.390> when<00:01:57.540> you<00:01:57.630> water<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:58.049> pot<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.469> water

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
so that when you water the pot the water
