00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
that was also an LCD so I looked at the

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.599 
39 inch which is this it was 350 bucks
and<00:03:46.540> then<00:03:47.379> the<00:03:47.590> lady<00:03:47.769> pointed<00:03:48.010> out<00:03:48.250> that<00:03:48.430> there

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:48.609 
and then the lady pointed out that there

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:52.080 
and then the lady pointed out that there
were<00:03:48.879> LEDs<00:03:49.870> which<00:03:50.139> are<00:03:50.319> better<00:03:50.530> I<00:03:50.919> think<00:03:51.190> a

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
were LEDs which are better I think a

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.170 
were LEDs which are better I think a
better<00:03:52.720> range<00:03:52.989> of<00:03:53.169> colors<00:03:53.819> the<00:03:54.819> screen<00:03:55.090> just

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
better range of colors the screen just

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.990 
better range of colors the screen just
looks<00:03:55.389> a<00:03:55.449> lot<00:03:55.569> nicer<00:03:55.799> for<00:03:56.799> $50<00:03:57.340> less<00:03:57.549> same

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
looks a lot nicer for $50 less same

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.390 
looks a lot nicer for $50 less same
exact<00:03:58.269> TV<00:03:58.599> but<00:03:59.169> it's<00:03:59.319> LED<00:03:59.739> and<00:03:59.859> it's<00:04:00.010> 50<00:04:00.220> bucks

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
exact TV but it's LED and it's 50 bucks

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.899 
exact TV but it's LED and it's 50 bucks
less<00:04:00.639> so<00:04:01.180> I<00:04:01.209> got<00:04:01.419> that<00:04:01.750> needless<00:04:02.409> to<00:04:02.440> say

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:02.909 
less so I got that needless to say

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:05.189 
less so I got that needless to say
because<00:04:03.909> it<00:04:04.000> was<00:04:04.090> on<00:04:04.180> sale<00:04:04.449> that's<00:04:04.840> why<00:04:04.989> it<00:04:05.049> was

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:05.199 
because it was on sale that's why it was

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:09.210 
because it was on sale that's why it was
cheaper<00:04:05.730> and<00:04:06.730> I<00:04:07.629> my<00:04:08.139> xbox<00:04:08.859> was<00:04:09.040> in<00:04:09.099> my

cheaper and I my xbox was in my

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.890 
cheaper and I my xbox was in my
