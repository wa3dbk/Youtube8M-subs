00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.670
 Hello everyone, I will show you Rome today 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.970
 invisible door through which you can 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.060
 pass completely unnoticed you don't need 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.060
 none 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:26.880
 say pistons and so on now 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:31.230
 I'll show you what it looks like. 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.870
 so here is not beautiful of course but it 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.350
 specially made to distract 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.920
 attention of the person who will seek 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.530
 the door itself is my flat world 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.039
 and it is very noticeable that here 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.940
 what is the catch but if you will 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:53.960
 play in the ordinary world and there will be a city 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:59.359
 the door there can be hidden much 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:04.769
 better show now how it works 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:07.860
 get up here we click on the lava and we 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:11.490
 We appear in the trolley already for another 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:15.420
 side on the other side where we have 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:22.159
 there will be a door like this 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:25.320
 mechanism teleportation occurs no 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:27.580
 we just sit down the trolley 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.140
 whole principle 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.510
 need to do such a distance by which 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.549
 we will be able to utter a word that's in here somewhere 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.400
 how many times two three four blocks on 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:41.990
 vertical 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:44.390
 four blocks is one variation here's another 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.659
 one variation on how i can do 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:51.140
 poured water to stealth course but 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:56.659
 everything can be seen again in the same window with 1 well 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:02:01.940
 look and teleport did another 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:03.590
 through another it through the fence here such 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.280
 their shadows have small windows 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:11.620
 through them itâ€™s as if imperceptibly possible 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:18.080
 get in now teleport 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:21.580
 so through them it is difficult to somehow get but 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.180
 Here mothers ported to the other side 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.840
 you might think 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:29.600
 many amount of their teleportation to 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.370
 nobody could see us and don't know 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.700
 maybe even through the iron door you can 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:40.370
 do everything let's see we put the iron 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:44.870
 door and put here a trolley 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:49.099
 rail take a trolley on it 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:51.620
 oh no no you can't do 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:55.430
 because she is completely active bad 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:59.480
 but it would be so cool 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.400
 mechanism that's all i wanted you 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.470
 to tell 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:08.720
 maybe you will come up with new variations 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:11.000
 if something come up new write in 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:15.069
 comments that's all subscribe 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.069
 Like everyone for now
