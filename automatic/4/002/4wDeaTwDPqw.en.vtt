you<00:00:30.990> decide<00:00:31.349> to<00:00:31.380> bring<00:00:31.650> one<00:00:32.210> okay<00:00:33.210> so<00:00:33.270> when<00:00:33.570> you

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
you decide to bring one okay so when you

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.090 
you decide to bring one okay so when you
bring<00:00:33.840> your<00:00:34.050> trailer<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.710> Outer<00:00:34.860> Banks

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
bring your trailer to the Outer Banks

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.819 
bring your trailer to the Outer Banks
and<00:00:35.850> this<00:00:36.360> is<00:00:36.540> this<00:00:37.020> is<00:00:37.140> my<00:00:37.320> trailer<00:00:37.710> for

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
and this is this is my trailer for

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.130 
and this is this is my trailer for
demonstration<00:00:38.690> there's<00:00:39.690> nothing<00:00:39.960> on<00:00:40.110> it

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
demonstration there's nothing on it

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.330 
demonstration there's nothing on it
obviously<00:00:41.450> but<00:00:42.450> it<00:00:42.570> does<00:00:42.750> weigh<00:00:42.989> about<00:00:43.340> 2,500

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
obviously but it does weigh about 2,500

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.090 
obviously but it does weigh about 2,500
pounds<00:00:44.789> so<00:00:45.420> it's<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:45.989> heavier<00:00:46.379> trailer<00:00:46.920> than

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
pounds so it's a heavier trailer than

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.670 
pounds so it's a heavier trailer than
most<00:00:47.450> anything<00:00:48.450> you<00:00:49.020> would<00:00:49.170> probably<00:00:49.559> be

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
most anything you would probably be

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.459 
most anything you would probably be
bringing<00:00:50.100> here<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:51.329> wait<00:00:51.629> this<00:00:51.930> truck<00:00:52.230> down<00:00:52.410> a

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
bringing here and wait this truck down a

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:53.840 
bringing here and wait this truck down a
little<00:00:52.800> bit<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:52.949> can<00:00:53.219> feel<00:00:53.460> it<00:00:53.610> when<00:00:53.699> I'm

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
little bit I can feel it when I'm

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.569 
little bit I can feel it when I'm
pulling<00:00:54.059> it<00:00:54.360> which<00:00:54.989> is<00:00:55.199> rare<00:00:55.469> for<00:00:55.800> this<00:00:56.280> truck

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
pulling it which is rare for this truck

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.240 
pulling it which is rare for this truck

so first thing you want to do is make

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.010 
so first thing you want to do is make

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
trailer tires getting air down is the

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.010 
trailer tires getting air down is the
most<00:01:06.470> overlooked<00:01:07.470> thing<00:01:07.799> we<00:01:08.070> have<00:01:08.280> happen

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
most overlooked thing we have happen

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.600 
most overlooked thing we have happen
these<00:01:10.020> tires<00:01:10.380> typically<00:01:10.920> hold<00:01:11.130> about<00:01:11.310> 80

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
these tires typically hold about 80

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.539 
these tires typically hold about 80
pounds<00:01:12.020> I've<00:01:13.020> got<00:01:13.290> them<00:01:13.439> around<00:01:13.650> 15<00:01:14.250> right<00:01:14.520> now

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
pounds I've got them around 15 right now

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.810 
pounds I've got them around 15 right now
15<00:01:15.180> or<00:01:15.330> 18<00:01:15.530> you<00:01:16.530> just<00:01:16.710> want<00:01:16.920> them<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.630> to<00:01:18.630> be<00:01:18.659> how

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
15 or 18 you just want them to to be how

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.030 
15 or 18 you just want them to to be how
squished<00:01:20.820> out<00:01:20.970> like<00:01:21.210> they<00:01:21.390> are<00:01:21.860> that's<00:01:22.860> the

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
squished out like they are that's the

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.230 
squished out like they are that's the
most<00:01:23.220> important<00:01:23.729> thing<00:01:23.850> because<00:01:23.939> if<00:01:24.150> you

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
most important thing because if you

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.749 
most important thing because if you
don't<00:01:24.360> air<00:01:24.630> down<00:01:24.840> those<00:01:25.080> trailer<00:01:25.500> tires<00:01:25.799> then

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
don't air down those trailer tires then

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.450 
don't air down those trailer tires then
it's<00:01:27.330> just<00:01:27.509> like<00:01:27.630> pulling<00:01:27.960> an<00:01:28.170> anchor<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.799> the

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
it's just like pulling an anchor and the

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.969

one of the reasons I wanted to do this

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.300 
one of the reasons I wanted to do this
video<00:02:57.690> today<00:02:58.049> is<00:02:58.200> I<00:02:58.709> don't<00:02:58.980> know<00:02:59.040> if<00:02:59.099> you<00:02:59.190> can

so rough today just got deep tracks just
up<00:03:09.810> and<00:03:10.109> down<00:03:11.299> so<00:03:12.299> it's<00:03:12.569> about<00:03:12.750> as<00:03:12.930> bad<00:03:13.140> as<00:03:13.170> it

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:13.409 
up and down so it's about as bad as it

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:15.080 
up and down so it's about as bad as it
beaches<00:03:13.769> you<00:03:13.890> would<00:03:14.010> have<00:03:14.220> pulling<00:03:14.790> a<00:03:14.849> trailer
