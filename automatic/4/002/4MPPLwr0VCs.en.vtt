 hello girls today carla today I want 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.280
 share with you a new video 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:10.700
 how to wax your armpits without irritation 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:13.200
 how to shave your armpits correctly 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.150
 Shave the armpits properly 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.150
 can help you feel confident to 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.890
 wear shirts or blouses without sleeves 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.100
 proper shaving technique also 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.289
 helps to prevent irritations 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.320
 infections and inflammations a good 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.369
 shaving will also last longer 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.070
 enabling a greater number of days 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.989
 without shaving again because the 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.480
 Armpit hair grows in different 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.210
 directions shaving this area can be 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.340
 a little more complicated than the others 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.079
 Fortunately you can follow 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.510
 several steps to achieve a shave 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:50.120
 perfect irritation instructions 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.100
 get a clean and sharp blade 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:56.250
 the rusty and unsharpened blades can 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.020
 cause infections and irritation likewise 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.969
 they will not cut the hair easily and 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.129
 you will have to pass the blade over 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.830
 the skin over and over again which can 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.720
 cause burning and inflammation if you use 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.900
 disposable blades 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.690
 a new one every time you go to shave 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:15.270
 Do not re use disposable blades if 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.190
 use non-disposable blades clean 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.910
 and I know that the completely after each 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:23.360
 shaved shave in the shower wet with 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.830
 Warm water your armpits for several minutes 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.230
 the warm water opens the pores of the skin 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.230
 and softens the hair making it easier 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:33.480
 to cut if you require shaving 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.340
 in front of the mirror do not let pass 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.250
 long after leaving the shower and 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.130
 start shaving cover the area with 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.380
 a moisturizing cream to shave if your 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.390
 skin is sensitive look for a cream that 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.270
 contain relaxing ingredients such as 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.490
 Eucalyptus or aloe did not spare the use 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.290
 of these creams since their goal is 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.150
 create a protective barrier between the 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.790
 skin and blade to prevent injuries 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.250
 and scrapes shave in it 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.050
 direction in which the hair grows is 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.729
 You may need to pull or tighten the 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.130
 hair to avoid hurting small 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.900
 skin folds although the hair 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.179
 it usually grows messy in 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.280
 different directions generally 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.750
 grows down so the shaving 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.060
 must be done in the same direction 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.830
 Rinse the blade after each stroke 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.770
 since the accumulated hair 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.630
 hinder the effectiveness of your edge not 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.070
 press against the skin with too much 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.950
 strength to prevent injuries and 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:29.350
 irritation if you notice that you need 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.880
 Too much pressure when shaving should 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.060
 see this as a sign that the 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.350
 blade does not have enough edge 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.560
 shaving properly should not 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.540
 require more than soft and short strokes 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.970
 after washing re apply more cream and 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.800
 start shaving again this time in 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.560
 direction contrary to the growth of 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:50.050
 hair from the bottom up or also from 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.580
 side by side usually should not 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.470
 shave an area more than twice 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.200
 since exceeding can cause 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.940
 irritation and inflammation after 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.920
 wash and dry apply a lotion 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.620
 moisturizer on the affected area if its 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.230
 skin is sensitive girl if you liked the
