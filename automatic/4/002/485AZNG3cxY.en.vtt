00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
kind of clean them up a bit also the one

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.780 
kind of clean them up a bit also the one
thing<00:01:50.570> about<00:01:50.830> working<00:01:51.830> with<00:01:51.860> flowers<00:01:52.520> that

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
thing about working with flowers that

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.460 
thing about working with flowers that
are<00:01:52.939> a<00:01:52.970> little<00:01:53.119> bit<00:01:53.299> less<00:01:53.420> expensive<00:01:53.659> is<00:01:54.409> that

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
are a little bit less expensive is that

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.380 
are a little bit less expensive is that
they<00:01:54.920> tend<00:01:55.159> to<00:01:55.280> kind<00:01:55.490> of<00:01:55.610> Bunch<00:01:55.850> all<00:01:56.150> up

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
they tend to kind of Bunch all up

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.090 
they tend to kind of Bunch all up
together<00:01:56.659> so<00:01:57.110> you<00:01:57.170> need<00:01:57.409> to<00:01:57.560> spread<00:01:57.799> them<00:01:57.920> out

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
together so you need to spread them out

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.289 
together so you need to spread them out
