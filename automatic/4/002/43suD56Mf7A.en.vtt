00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:04.950
 hi to all people this is boxing 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.390
 I hope you are good family 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.880
 the business the friends the loves and the 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.590
 health then today we end up 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.840
 for an easter egg for which I 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.980
 great pleasure to introduce you to everything 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.170
 just because it's one of 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.000
 first rule rist not that I have 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.960
 discovered or even that I was presenting on 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.480
 my channel is simply one of 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.220
 first easter egg that I realized 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.810
 in a video game it was a friend who 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.180
 had spoken at the time so he's 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.490
 extremely well known but not far 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.790
 less epic 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:35.610
 it is the beating heart of the winged 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.620
 batteries in gta iv so for that 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.440
 would you have to take a helicopter 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.420
 and that you were executing learning fell 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.550
 on the ledge where I was next 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.989
 will have to pass through a door that 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.670
 is not materialized you can 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.219
 to go through without needing 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.379
 to open then offer yourself to you 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.820
 see a huge scale that will require 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:59.250
 to climb and you will arrive at the heart 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.770
 this is the case to say it in the heart of the 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.719
 statue of freedom of new york 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.159
 so he is attached by chains i 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.150
 beats all the time so some people think 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:11.729
 and even I think I think like them 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:14.820
 it symbolizes the heart of america that 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.689
 keable in this miss freedom as they 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.460
 call it with chains that shows 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:22.500
 it is inseparable in this box 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.399
 certainly a little meaning 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.570
 little philosophical certainly 20 May 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:29.340
 in any case it is a history that to 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.920
 first time I saw them I 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.090
 does what happens at the time the 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.590
 hysterics was not the trick either 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.450
 the most common in video games 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.799
 now we know that the developers 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.570
 are sometimes fun but at the time 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.520
 I know it had sparked a lot 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.289
 interrogations at home finally brief 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.020
 this is one of the first would remain that 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:47.429
 that I discovered the divine paul pouget 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.750
 last I did in a video game 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:50.549
 that's why I wanted you m 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.860
 I think that will remind a lot of 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.929
 memories to a lot of you because 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.090
 that gta iv was still a gta 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:59.220
 epic by the way like all the gta and 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.659
 this aig story certainly made 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.750
 fun to a lot of people and I think 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.399
 that many people will be happy to 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.679
 find him in this top 15 so that's it 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.500
 I hope this story is that you 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:12.720
 rained we'll meet again soon for the 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.549
 next episode with a hysterical who 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.840
 I hope you will like even more than 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:16.200
 this one she and I tell you to very 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.819
 soon 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.819
 it was locster 8
