00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.230
 hello you are welcome at 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.070
 opinion today I'm going to transform 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.139
 paula as if by magic in clown 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:18.869
 for that I use makeup 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.970
 water soluble api a sponge 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.289
 to apply the basecoat a 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.899
 brush and glitter 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:28.039
 we start by applying the layer of 

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:28.039
 base white color 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:35.530
 bridges I must not be too much 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:40.059
 wet otherwise the painting will not take 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.059
 you have to leave that in a few minutes 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.650
 as soon as the paint is dry and 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.650
 continue with the red nose 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.079
 for one eye I use the blue color 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.540
 as long as the paint is still wet 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.890
 we must add glitter 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.890
 so they will hold better 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.390
 the second goal we the col would have in 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.390
 yellow 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.500
 2 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.909
 there too I add glitter 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.940
 m 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.140
 then I continue to mouth in 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.140
 red 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:01.810
 I add some glitter on the 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.810
 nose 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.910
 and that's it in a short time 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.560
 I transformed paola into a clown 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.560
 she is ready to party 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:32.379
