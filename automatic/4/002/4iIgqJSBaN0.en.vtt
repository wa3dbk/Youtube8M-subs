 talk about narrow shelves models 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.310
 today I am not by chance the leader 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.380
 on make this jersey miami hit because 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.240
 that it will be mainly about sneakers 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.699
 king james lebron 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:27.269
 1 whose beauty I want to tell 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.760
 called sneakers in data coloring 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.940
 we and this tenth lebron and classic 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.250
 high model but what are they famous for alone 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.059
 of the most interesting colors lebronov 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.180
 which originates in the second 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:41.010
 lebrona 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.160
 also she was in several sneakers 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.230
 series lebron singers and gradually she 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.730
 it was getting dark if it was the first sneakers 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.670
 whiter 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.010
 gray now they now see almost 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.079
 black but what always remained 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.170
 unchanged is the presence of such 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.109
 poisonous green elements on this 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.989
 sneakers why is the matter given that these 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:06.150
 sneakers are dedicated to basketball player 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.100
 lebrona not just like basketball players but 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.960
 as a specialist in laying the ball in 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.150
 ring ball on top 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.360
 it is this art we are all the time 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.520
 amazed that this is something impossible 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.800
 beyond the limits of the possibility of something poisonous 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.780
 as if he is a mutant of some kind of radiation 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.670
 Apparently therefore such a radiation 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.100
 the color is well and almost on 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.400
 All releases are small such a figure 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.710
 Danko she rare enough sneakers 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.320
 quite interesting coloring cost 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:36.020
 order to pay attention and maybe 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.910
 purchase the next sneakers can 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.010
 be they seem a little bit for by knowing 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.030
 because it is called crymas 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.160
 Christmas 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.680
 but such a color she is all the time 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.660
 interesting all the time bright and all the time 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.729
 I already talked about the example 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.860
 some other sneakers what exactly 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.590
 such sneakers traditionally appear 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.560
 sales before the new year so here 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.590
 green color christmas tree 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.130
 red color santa claus herringbone 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.920
 ignite 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.210
 cheers mama give me a gift why not 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.460
 give such wonderful sneakers 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.190
 play basketball with him and his son 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.720
 studied and the third model tenth lebronov 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.570
 high about which we want today 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:18.320
 tell the model that got it 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:20.510
 nickname like lava lava is also not due to 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:25.040
 there is no burning bright thing 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:28.040
 lava slow but inevitable everything 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.880
 absorbing substance is the same as 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.400
 james lebron 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.049
 he is lebron james man who 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.510
 may not be the fastest on if he 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:36.440
 entered the field in his hands the ball rather 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.019
 just add to cart 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.970
 he 'll beat him up really 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:43.670
 reminds lava there is such a gray 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.489
 the black color of the light amount of ash and 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.760
 bright orange color is llama 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:50.730
 Here you can 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.590
 look black with such specks 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:57.269
 orange as if really 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:59.519
 such lava does not burn an interesting moment 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.590
 the debut of these sneakers took place during 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:04.220
 games miami hit vs new york nix 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.230
 who unfortunately miami lost 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.760
 lebron came out in these sneakers to the court and 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.909
 he almost managed to do 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:14.989
 triple double, that is, three indicators 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:17.939
 that matter more than 10 9 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:20.849
 studio that day he scored 31 points 

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:23.549
 made 10 rebounds and 10 scoring 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:25.349
 gears almost lied to one wife 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:27.450
 Tatyana you peredachku but here such he 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:29.909
 A good debut of sneakers may not be 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.900
 falls short of the river to the legendary but 

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:34.109
 shows that 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.700
 beauty is something famous and another 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:37.920
 model and which is impossible not 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:41.730
 tell the appearance that you probably 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.500
 waited a long time for 28 jordan and i love very much 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.230
 say that sneakers should not 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:49.530
 stand still and must develop and 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.989
 maybe it will not be the right step 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:54.510
 development dead end view but the fact that development 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.700
 it must be exactly new itself 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.520
 sneakers it seems to me they should you 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.050
 should some questions arise when they 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.780
 the form is well understood that when people 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:06.330
 The first time I saw sneakers 28 journey 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.700
 they did not believe what it is some 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.830
 nija shoes some strange 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.470
 sneakers though when you take in hand 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.120
 I understand that there is only one 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:20.310
 such a small element which hut 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:22.290
 meets here is such a well cheholchik me 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:25.139
 it seems that as an element to bring 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:28.110
 something new why not very 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:30.660
 interesting too interesting coloring 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.370
 when i first saw first i thought 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.320
 understandably made red 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.450
 black and white colors for the team 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.910
 chicago bulls turned out to be completely wrong 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:41.700
 the fact is that this coloring was done 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.710
 specially for schoolchildren from poker 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:46.169
 academy or academy differently 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:49.590
 pronunciations what kind of academy is this 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:52.110
 this ordinary school is not an institution not 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.150
 university where high school students 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.370
 it is unusual only because in due time 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.860
 this school is completed by such stars as 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:01.620
 Kevin Durant Carmel You Anthony &amp; 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.330
 jerry's so house now shining on 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.160
 courts nb and 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.110
 and especially for these guys 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.780
 show that here they are a new generation 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:11.700
 basketball students of this school so and this 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.660
 a new generation of sneakers for them 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.680

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.680

 who are here now here are such 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.669
 basketball news it is clear that this 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.280
 absolutely not all have a large number 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:25.020
 other interesting sneakers but they 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.150
