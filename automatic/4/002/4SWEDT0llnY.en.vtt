00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.270
 hit by lila brows it's time for 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.370
 new shopping video and 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.950
 but in how I chose harry potter 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.019
 which I first saw aisha and 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.950
 Oli monday channel links about 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.890
 which you can find in the description 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.869
 given pegovoy and video or given text 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.880
 consists of 14 questions that I 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.340
 I will try to answer the maximum ionko and 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.880
 in the shortest possible time because 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.880
 I like to speak quickly the first question 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.180
 your favorite book is my favorite book 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.920
 then probably the Order of the Phoenix and the first book 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.719
 harry potter and the philosopher's stone because 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.489
 that they are both incredibly interesting 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.680
 philosopher's stone is the beginning of harry 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.930
 potter this is harry potter such that i 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.910
 love remember little funny and funny 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.460
 which is nothing in this magical world 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.440
 understands well, and I love the Order of the Phoenix 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:52.110
 because there is a strict strict hierarchy 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.570
 and a bunch of new heroes are still mysterious 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.149
 mysterious beautiful houses appear in 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.940
 lanes and against every magic 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:03.180
 Junjon rolling adore two books 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.519
 the second question is my favorite film 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.040
 favorite movie also filmed the first book 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.430
 this is harry potter and the philosopher's stone 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.960
 the third question is my least favorite book 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.330
 Harry Potter's least favorite book 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.990
 probably what movie is the second part 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.310

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.810

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.549
 much love the movie harry potter and 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.030
 the secret room seems to me the most 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.280
 sad and uninteresting fourth question 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.250
 favorite character my favorite character 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.130
 this is probably a professor of snow or a professor 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.619
 Snape what heights because it 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.390
 character who is so deep and he 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.070
 is he a character who is completely 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.750
 revealed to us really only in 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.430
 late most not guilty besides made 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.310
 Of course handsome on a fork, even without 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.930

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.579
 who all this understand nothing but when 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.650
 this is with each movie more and more . 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.810

 also starring harry potter 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.730
 in the first parts 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:57.410
 I hope these two options are counted 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.450
 seventh question at which faculty would you be 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.880
 wanted to study 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:03.680
 I guess I'll go after the bill and ollie and 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.370
 we will study together in slytherin and 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.620
 if the hat helps but what if the hat hat 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.100
 decide otherwise I would like to go to 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.459
 claw 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:15.739
 about the reasons for which I want to go 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.870
 in kogtevran I already said in my video 

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:20.950
 about books that make me 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:24.350
 hate your life the eighth question 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:26.420
 what patronus would you have I don't know 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.760
 why but you want me to 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.500
 raccoon was a patronus I love denote 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.650
 I know that the cartridge must be fast 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.360
 but i want denote we live in peacetime 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.860
 so I think absolutely no matter 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.340
 how fast or slow 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:42.890
 my demand which I want denote ninth 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.240
 question for you to choose resurrection 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.940
 invisibility stone 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.680
 or elder wand I would probably 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.150
 chose urine stealth at least 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.250
 because if I had a mother and 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.020
 Invisible woman, I could take you a video tour 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.000
 post one of the most wonderful 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.450
 Of course, shops in St. Petersburg around the house 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.790
 books 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.440
 but in the house books can not be removed because 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.870
 that we have books in our house 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.880
 state secret and so if you 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.500
 you get the iphone then I'll start all at once 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:11.810
 I think you want to shoot something in 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:14.690
 home of the book so monty is not visible to 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.640
 google-defined tenth question in 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.919
 quidditch team what position would you 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:21.140
 occupied now we answer is correct by 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:21.739
 sounds very silly but besides running around 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:26.770
 swimming 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:29.150
 sport is not mine therefore choosing your 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:33.020
 position position in the quidditch team 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:35.780
 I probably choose the position of the fan I 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:38.990
 I will be beautiful to come on although ill but 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:42.740
 there is no catching balls and throwing 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:45.350
 balls stand gate expect on checks i 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.090
 I will be sick to scream and here there 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:50.330
 buna somewhere far away I will sit 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:52.550
 just to stay alive eleventh 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:55.640
 question did you play any videos 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:57.169
 games I remember that class in the second or in 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.360
 third when I went to visit my 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:02.660
 her classmate and her computer was 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:05.120
 some kind of game will help on the first book or 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.650
 2 but I remember exactly here in my 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.000
 head is forbidden to pictures like you with 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.710
 we need to explain computers to him 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.240
 play there such a little harry under 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.370
 epam it was some kind of game related and 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.900
 on the left a little lego harry potter ran 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.210
 Howards along the corridors is all I remember 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.680
 and I never played again I never saw and 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:20.419
 Harry Potter's coat of arms for the snow was not 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.390
 always been more directed towards 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:26.110
 dresses up barbie barbie house barbie barbie 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:28.970
 sims sims ii gta 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:31.100
 now more terrible bloody games 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.760
 rushing gta then we were my best 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.610
 friends 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:38.750
 12 question what moments in the books of the film 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:40.430
 made you cry well of course here 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:40.770
 I do not even know how at such times from 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:41.970
 hiv 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.349
 because it can all be considered 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:46.740
 spoilers and what if some of you do not 

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:49.259
 I read del potro I just now were 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.909
 there are very sad moments when they died 

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:52.919
 some characters when some 

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:54.990
 characters how you died in the last two 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:57.150
 the film in general just hope I expect 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.860
 last last most 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.050
 the last part of harry potter inspected 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:04.319
 three times a movie and every time there 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:07.979
 ash here and so in 3d fly into the eyes 

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:10.379
 the end didn’t want question 13 

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:12.509
 did you like the final question again so 

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:14.849
 and ask for spoilers yes to me the final 

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:17.490
 liked and honestly I would like 

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:23.970
 ever suddenly see a friend 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:26.280
 continuation of the children but it is unlikely 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:28.259
 grandfather will see therefore we can only think out 

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:31.889
 yourself to happen in lives 

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:36.780
 mini potter mates are less weasley and and 

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:38.310
 others any such magic some 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:41.370
 I must pick a word I can not pick up 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:43.949
 words and last question how important 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:46.590
 for you the world of harry potter to be honest 

00:06:43.949 --> 00:06:49.169
 in childhood harry potter special 

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:50.699
 I was not impressed by 

00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:53.550
 At least I do not remember that I once 

00:06:50.699 --> 00:06:56.190
 went crazy or waited there until 13 

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:57.750
 4 billion other years letter from 

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:59.580
 hogwarts i remember exactly that mom 

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:00.719
 I did not buy their books read mom 

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.849
 did take me to the cinema 

00:07:00.719 --> 00:07:04.340
 for the time being but of course 

00:07:02.849 --> 00:07:06.990
 for real 

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:08.460
 harry potter produced on me 

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:11.580
 only the impression is already more 

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:13.830
 conscious age of 14 probably 

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:15.750
 I realized that I wildly like this series 

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:17.490
 in the summer of 2010 I already have all the books 

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:20.039
 reread in english and 

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:21.449
 i was simple then i was crying then 

00:07:20.039 --> 00:07:23.159
 cried at the end because i dont 

00:07:21.449 --> 00:07:24.719
 I wanted to part of this series I hope 

00:07:23.159 --> 00:07:26.099
 you liked this video and you come on 

00:07:24.719 --> 00:07:27.330
 video of me that gets mi sung 

00:07:26.099 --> 00:07:29.190
 stormy because they are involuntarily 

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:31.800
 a cloud to a question sometimes I just see it 

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:33.539
 even for the first time but somehow 

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:35.250
 see you soon vallee burley go on 

00:07:33.539 --> 00:07:36.990
 in the comments recommend not books 

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:38.449
 that you wanted me to read 

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:40.699
 because i still 

00:07:38.449 --> 00:07:45.009
 expand your literary books 

00:07:40.699 --> 00:07:49.150
 outlook and see you soon there was a game 

00:07:45.009 --> 00:07:49.150
 I have a similar to Hagrid
