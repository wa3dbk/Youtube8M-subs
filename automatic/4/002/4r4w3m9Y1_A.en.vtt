God<00:01:23.360> gave<00:01:23.630> us<00:01:23.690> yeast<00:01:24.140> for<00:01:24.380> a<00:01:24.410> reason<00:01:24.860> they

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:24.980 
God gave us yeast for a reason they

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.220 
God gave us yeast for a reason they
naturally<00:01:25.460> occur<00:01:25.730> in<00:01:25.760> our<00:01:26.060> colon<00:01:26.330> they're<00:01:27.050> the

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:27.230 
naturally occur in our colon they're the

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:28.810 
naturally occur in our colon they're the
scavengers<00:01:27.860> of<00:01:27.890> the<00:01:28.100> human<00:01:28.400> body<00:01:28.520> they're

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
scavengers of the human body they're

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.280 
scavengers of the human body they're
like<00:01:28.970> the<00:01:29.120> garbageman<00:01:29.570> they<00:01:29.810> work<00:01:29.960> on<00:01:30.170> the

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
like the garbageman they work on the

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.500 
like the garbageman they work on the
dead<00:01:30.500> stuff<00:01:30.800> dead<00:01:31.100> cells<00:01:31.460> of<00:01:31.700> slough<00:01:31.940> off<00:01:32.210> dead

dead stuff dead cells of slough off dead
food<00:01:32.750> that's<00:01:33.020> accumulated<00:01:33.350> so<00:01:34.040> we<00:01:34.190> need<00:01:34.400> these

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.550 
food that's accumulated so we need these

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.330 
food that's accumulated so we need these
guys<00:01:34.790> to<00:01:35.060> perform<00:01:35.420> a<00:01:35.570> vital<00:01:35.900> role

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
guys to perform a vital role

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.220 
guys to perform a vital role
unfortunately<00:01:37.340> if<00:01:37.580> they<00:01:37.910> over<00:01:38.450> grow<00:01:38.690> and<00:01:39.110> we

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:39.230 
unfortunately if they over grow and we

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.920 
unfortunately if they over grow and we
get<00:01:39.410> too<00:01:39.680> many<00:01:39.920> Candida<00:01:40.730> or<00:01:41.090> yeast<00:01:41.330> or<00:01:41.540> fungus

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
get too many Candida or yeast or fungus

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.520 
get too many Candida or yeast or fungus
then<00:01:42.710> that<00:01:43.010> poses<00:01:43.730> a<00:01:43.760> problem<00:01:44.270> and<00:01:44.750> again<00:01:45.290> they

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
then that poses a problem and again they

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.500 
then that poses a problem and again they
will<00:01:45.710> over<00:01:46.070> grow<00:01:46.280> when<00:01:46.490> there's<00:01:46.700> an<00:01:47.000> open

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510 
will over grow when there's an open

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.660 
will over grow when there's an open
fertile<00:01:47.900> ground<00:01:48.560> on<00:01:48.830> the<00:01:48.950> colon<00:01:49.280> wall<00:01:49.460> to

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
fertile ground on the colon wall to

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.220 
fertile ground on the colon wall to
overgrowth<00:01:50.150> but<00:01:50.360> also<00:01:50.570> if<00:01:50.840> we<00:01:50.870> throw

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:51.230 
overgrowth but also if we throw

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.140 
overgrowth but also if we throw
fertilizer<00:01:51.800> on<00:01:52.100> them<00:01:52.280> they'll<00:01:52.520> really<00:01:52.880> over

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.150 
fertilizer on them they'll really over

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.170 
fertilizer on them they'll really over
grow<00:01:53.410> fungus<00:01:54.410> love<00:01:54.710> sugar<00:01:55.160> and<00:01:55.760> as<00:01:56.030> I

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
grow fungus love sugar and as I

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.850 
grow fungus love sugar and as I
mentioned<00:01:56.570> earlier<00:01:56.660> the<00:01:57.110> average<00:01:57.140> American

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
mentioned earlier the average American

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.920 
mentioned earlier the average American
consumes<00:01:58.280> a<00:01:58.400> pound<00:01:58.640> of<00:01:58.760> sugar<00:01:58.910> in<00:01:59.120> four<00:01:59.390> days

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
consumes a pound of sugar in four days

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.140 
consumes a pound of sugar in four days
so<00:02:00.530> basically<00:02:00.890> what<00:02:01.160> we're<00:02:01.340> doing<00:02:01.370> is<00:02:01.670> wiping

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
so basically what we're doing is wiping

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.940 
so basically what we're doing is wiping
out<00:02:02.270> our<00:02:02.300> good<00:02:02.570> guys<00:02:02.810> to<00:02:03.020> the<00:02:03.110> probiotics<00:02:03.770> and

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
out our good guys to the probiotics and

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.910 
out our good guys to the probiotics and
then<00:02:04.580> we're<00:02:04.730> fertilizing<00:02:05.420> the<00:02:05.630> candida<00:02:06.080> so

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
then we're fertilizing the candida so

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.400 
then we're fertilizing the candida so
pretty<00:02:07.250> soon<00:02:07.430> we<00:02:07.730> get<00:02:08.000> what's<00:02:08.600> called<00:02:08.899> gut

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
pretty soon we get what's called gut

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.660 
pretty soon we get what's called gut
dysbiosis<00:02:10.210> which<00:02:11.210> is<00:02:11.390> a<00:02:11.420> fancy<00:02:11.900> term<00:02:12.080> for

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
dysbiosis which is a fancy term for

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.380 
dysbiosis which is a fancy term for
imbalance<00:02:13.630> of<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:14.140> gut<00:02:14.349> bacteria<00:02:15.209> good<00:02:16.209> guys

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
imbalance of the gut bacteria good guys

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.080 
imbalance of the gut bacteria good guys
are<00:02:16.599> down<00:02:16.810> bad<00:02:17.260> guys<00:02:17.290> are<00:02:17.709> up<00:02:17.890> what<00:02:18.550> happens<00:02:18.970> it

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
are down bad guys are up what happens it

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.910 
are down bad guys are up what happens it
in<00:02:19.470> is<00:02:20.470> these<00:02:20.860> guys<00:02:21.849> these<00:02:22.510> fungal<00:02:23.140> guys<00:02:23.530> and

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
in is these guys these fungal guys and

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.850 
in is these guys these fungal guys and
other<00:02:24.400> microbes<00:02:25.270> that<00:02:25.450> are<00:02:25.569> dangerous<00:02:25.989> can

other microbes that are dangerous can

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.770 
other microbes that are dangerous can

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.660 
well the liver is where the human body
stores<00:02:46.360> extra<00:02:47.080> sugar<00:02:47.350> if<00:02:47.739> we<00:02:47.980> have<00:02:48.160> any<00:02:48.310> extra

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
stores extra sugar if we have any extra

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.970 
stores extra sugar if we have any extra
sugar<00:02:48.880> it'll<00:02:49.569> be<00:02:49.690> stored<00:02:50.050> in<00:02:50.200> the<00:02:50.319> liver<00:02:50.470> in

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
sugar it'll be stored in the liver in

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.550 
sugar it'll be stored in the liver in
Africa<00:02:51.670> when<00:02:51.850> the<00:02:51.970> kids<00:02:52.209> are<00:02:52.360> starving<00:02:52.780> there

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
Africa when the kids are starving there

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.170 
Africa when the kids are starving there
is<00:02:53.650> no<00:02:53.799> extra<00:02:54.130> sugar<00:02:54.400> they<00:02:54.580> don't<00:02:54.730> have<00:02:54.910> sugar

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
is no extra sugar they don't have sugar

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.759 
is no extra sugar they don't have sugar
in<00:02:55.360> their<00:02:55.480> liver<00:02:55.720> but<00:02:55.959> we<00:02:56.170> have<00:02:56.410> plenty<00:02:56.650> of

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
in their liver but we have plenty of

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:59.250 
in their liver but we have plenty of
extra<00:02:57.130> sugar<00:02:57.160> and<00:02:57.970> as<00:02:58.450> I<00:02:58.600> mentioned<00:02:58.959> earlier

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
extra sugar and as I mentioned earlier

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.740 
extra sugar and as I mentioned earlier
fungus<00:02:59.769> loves<00:03:00.130> sugar<00:03:00.370> so<00:03:00.970> the<00:03:01.120> fungus<00:03:01.390> just

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
fungus loves sugar so the fungus just

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:03.660 
fungus loves sugar so the fungus just
jumped<00:03:02.080> in<00:03:02.170> the<00:03:02.290> portal<00:03:02.620> vein<00:03:02.680> Road<00:03:03.280> up<00:03:03.459> to<00:03:03.580> the

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
jumped in the portal vein Road up to the

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.670 
jumped in the portal vein Road up to the
liver<00:03:03.910> and<00:03:04.090> now<00:03:04.660> they<00:03:04.870> found<00:03:05.140> the<00:03:05.230> Fort<00:03:05.470> Knox

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
liver and now they found the Fort Knox

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.890 
liver and now they found the Fort Knox
of<00:03:05.950> sugar<00:03:06.190> storage<00:03:06.670> and<00:03:07.000> they<00:03:07.269> multiply<00:03:07.450> like

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
of sugar storage and they multiply like

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.800 
of sugar storage and they multiply like
crazy<00:03:07.930> throughout<00:03:08.620> the<00:03:08.830> liver<00:03:09.209> now<00:03:10.209> you've

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
crazy throughout the liver now you've

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.070 
crazy throughout the liver now you've
got<00:03:11.049> all<00:03:11.440> of<00:03:11.500> your<00:03:12.190> blood<00:03:12.569> every<00:03:13.569> drop<00:03:13.810> of<00:03:13.840> your

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
got all of your blood every drop of your

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.420 
got all of your blood every drop of your
blood<00:03:14.200> makes<00:03:14.530> its<00:03:14.739> way<00:03:14.769> through<00:03:15.130> the<00:03:15.220> liver

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
blood makes its way through the liver

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.270 
blood makes its way through the liver
every<00:03:15.730> three<00:03:16.360> minutes<00:03:16.620> so<00:03:17.620> do<00:03:17.799> the<00:03:17.920> math<00:03:18.100> on

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
every three minutes so do the math on

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.860 
every three minutes so do the math on
that<00:03:18.519> however<00:03:18.790> many<00:03:19.060> minutes<00:03:19.269> are<00:03:19.540> in<00:03:19.600> a<00:03:19.720> day

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
that however many minutes are in a day

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.740 
that however many minutes are in a day
that's<00:03:20.769> how<00:03:21.070> many<00:03:21.340> times<00:03:21.400> your<00:03:21.760> blood<00:03:22.000> makes

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
that's how many times your blood makes

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.780 
that's how many times your blood makes
it<00:03:23.049> through<00:03:23.350> the<00:03:23.530> filter<00:03:23.920> your<00:03:24.400> liver

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
it through the filter your liver

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.240 
it through the filter your liver
it's<00:03:25.120> full<00:03:25.359> of<00:03:25.390> fungus<00:03:25.870> so<00:03:26.590> the<00:03:26.739> fungus<00:03:27.070> will

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
it's full of fungus so the fungus will

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.430 
it's full of fungus so the fungus will
jump<00:03:27.489> into<00:03:27.760> that<00:03:27.880> bloodstream<00:03:28.359> and<00:03:28.630> ride<00:03:28.810> the

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
jump into that bloodstream and ride the

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.729 
jump into that bloodstream and ride the
wave<00:03:29.709> and<00:03:29.739> go<00:03:30.250> and<00:03:30.609> find<00:03:30.880> a<00:03:31.000> place<00:03:31.150> to<00:03:31.510> hide

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
wave and go and find a place to hide

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.840 
wave and go and find a place to hide
throughout<00:03:32.739> your<00:03:32.920> body<00:03:33.070> it<00:03:33.370> can<00:03:33.400> be<00:03:33.640> in<00:03:33.760> a

how<00:04:36.720> it<00:04:36.840> works<00:04:37.080> but<00:04:37.680> one<00:04:37.890> interesting<00:04:38.100> thing

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:38.670 
how it works but one interesting thing

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:41.990 
how it works but one interesting thing
we<00:04:38.790> discovered<00:04:39.360> during<00:04:39.390> that<00:04:39.780> project<00:04:40.350> was<00:04:41.000> we

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
we discovered during that project was we

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.380 
we discovered during that project was we
have<00:04:42.210> a<00:04:42.240> lot<00:04:42.480> of<00:04:42.560> non-human<00:04:43.560> DNA<00:04:43.590> in<00:04:44.280> us<00:04:44.460> now

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:45.390 
have a lot of non-human DNA in us now

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.510 
have a lot of non-human DNA in us now
what<00:04:45.840> we<00:04:45.960> did<00:04:46.140> was<00:04:46.320> take<00:04:46.590> samples<00:04:47.190> of<00:04:47.310> blood

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
what we did was take samples of blood

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.850 
what we did was take samples of blood
from<00:04:47.850> young<00:04:48.120> healthy<00:04:48.630> individuals<00:04:49.230> who

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
from young healthy individuals who

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.280 
from young healthy individuals who
didn't<00:04:50.400> have<00:04:50.490> any<00:04:50.550> diseases<00:04:51.240> no<00:04:51.690> symptoms<00:04:52.230> no

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 
didn't have any diseases no symptoms no

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.160 
didn't have any diseases no symptoms no
medications<00:04:53.240> and<00:04:54.240> we<00:04:54.510> started<00:04:54.810> analyzing

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:55.170 
medications and we started analyzing

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.100 
medications and we started analyzing
their<00:04:55.590> blood<00:04:55.800> and<00:04:56.190> in<00:04:56.580> pulling<00:04:57.330> their<00:04:57.450> DNA<00:04:57.870> out

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
their blood and in pulling their DNA out

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.659 
their blood and in pulling their DNA out
what<00:04:58.410> we<00:04:58.530> noticed<00:04:58.919> was<00:04:59.100> there's<00:04:59.310> a<00:04:59.400> lot<00:04:59.430> of

00:04:59.659 --> 00:04:59.669 
what we noticed was there's a lot of

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:01.400 
what we noticed was there's a lot of
non-human<00:05:00.090> DNA<00:05:00.300> and<00:05:00.780> we<00:05:00.870> had<00:05:01.020> to<00:05:01.140> sort<00:05:01.320> of

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.410 
non-human DNA and we had to sort of

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:03.050 
non-human DNA and we had to sort of
filter<00:05:01.650> through<00:05:01.980> that<00:05:02.160> but<00:05:02.400> non-human<00:05:03.030> DNA

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
filter through that but non-human DNA

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.600 
filter through that but non-human DNA
over<00:05:03.540> to<00:05:03.750> the<00:05:03.870> side<00:05:04.080> and<00:05:04.320> human<00:05:04.830> DNA<00:05:04.980> over<00:05:05.340> here

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
over to the side and human DNA over here

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.610 
over to the side and human DNA over here
so<00:05:05.760> we<00:05:05.850> could<00:05:06.000> study<00:05:06.210> it<00:05:06.390> and<00:05:07.050> what<00:05:07.260> it<00:05:07.380> ended

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
so we could study it and what it ended

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.590 
so we could study it and what it ended
up<00:05:07.710> being<00:05:07.980> at<00:05:08.100> the<00:05:08.190> end<00:05:08.310> of<00:05:08.430> the<00:05:08.520> day<00:05:08.700> there

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 
up being at the end of the day there

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.830 
up being at the end of the day there
were<00:05:09.720> ten<00:05:10.260> times<00:05:10.620> more<00:05:11.060> non-human<00:05:12.060> DNA<00:05:12.090> than

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
were ten times more non-human DNA than

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.200 
were ten times more non-human DNA than
