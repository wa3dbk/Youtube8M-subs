what I wanted to show you guys is
something<00:00:36.270> that<00:00:36.360> may<00:00:36.570> work<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.079> I'm<00:00:37.140> going<00:00:37.290> to

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
something that may work and I'm going to

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.430 
something that may work and I'm going to
try<00:00:37.500> this<00:00:37.530> next<00:00:37.950> because<00:00:38.340> it<00:00:39.020> makes<00:00:40.020> sense<00:00:40.290> to

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
try this next because it makes sense to

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.590 
try this next because it makes sense to
me<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:41.309> before<00:00:41.430> in<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.030> breeding<00:00:42.180> santuary

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
me and before in the breeding santuary

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.170 
me and before in the breeding santuary
calculator<00:00:43.230> would<00:00:43.860> i<00:00:44.100> bred<00:00:44.430> for<00:00:44.700> ice<00:00:44.910> and

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
calculator would i bred for ice and

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.549 
calculator would i bred for ice and
cloud<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.809> have<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:45.989> twenty-nine<00:00:46.440> percent

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
cloud you have a twenty-nine percent

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.770 
cloud you have a twenty-nine percent
chance<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:47.250> getting<00:00:47.520> steamed<00:00:47.820> but<00:00:48.539> you<00:00:48.629> have<00:00:48.719> a

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
chance of getting steamed but you have a

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.299 
chance of getting steamed but you have a
higher<00:00:48.960> chance<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.620> get<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.829> ice<00:00:49.920> cube<00:00:50.219> earth

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
higher chance to get the ice cube earth

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.160 
higher chance to get the ice cube earth
I<00:00:50.460> speed<00:00:50.760> drag<00:00:50.940> Ice<00:00:51.239> Cube<00:00:51.539> dragons<00:00:51.960> what<00:00:52.079> I've

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
I speed drag Ice Cube dragons what I've

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.479 
I speed drag Ice Cube dragons what I've
been<00:00:52.320> Getty<00:00:52.559> that's<00:00:52.890> what<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.039> got<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.340> last

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
been Getty that's what I got the last

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.970 
been Getty that's what I got the last
time<00:00:53.789> when<00:00:54.000> I<00:00:54.030> harvested<00:00:54.449> those<00:00:54.629> guys<00:00:54.899> so<00:00:55.739> yeah

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
time when I harvested those guys so yeah

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.459 
time when I harvested those guys so yeah
it's<00:00:56.699> very<00:00:56.969> it's<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.360> low<00:00:57.480> chance<00:00:57.510> but<00:00:58.140> right

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
it's very it's a low chance but right

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.930 
it's very it's a low chance but right
now<00:00:58.649> these<00:00:58.829> are<00:00:59.010> we<00:00:59.100> three<00:00:59.280> dragons<00:00:59.670> you<00:00:59.760> can

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
now these are we three dragons you can

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.099 
now these are we three dragons you can
get<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.329> hype<00:01:00.449> only<00:01:00.690> be<00:01:00.809> getting<00:01:01.020> these

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
get and hype only be getting these

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.470 
get and hype only be getting these
because<00:01:01.469> these<00:01:02.039> two<00:01:02.309> because<00:01:03.000> it's<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.329> higher

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
because these two because it's a higher

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.740 
because these two because it's a higher
chance<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.930> get<00:01:04.049> these<00:01:04.229> guys<00:01:04.409> but<00:01:05.720> when<00:01:06.720> I

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
chance to get these guys but when I

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.560 
chance to get these guys but when I
decided<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.950> try<00:01:08.340> out<00:01:08.369> my<00:01:08.670> Great<00:01:08.909> White<00:01:09.150> Dragon

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
decided to try out my Great White Dragon

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.480 
decided to try out my Great White Dragon
which<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:09.810> actually<00:01:10.049> when<00:01:10.350> I<00:01:10.380> meant<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:11.010> select

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
which is actually when I meant to select

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.460 
which is actually when I meant to select
and<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.939> pure<00:01:12.150> dragon<00:01:12.390> keeps<00:01:12.750> pushing<00:01:13.170> itself

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
and the pure dragon keeps pushing itself

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.039 
and the pure dragon keeps pushing itself
in<00:01:13.710> there<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.010> rate<00:01:14.189> this<00:01:14.400> one<00:01:14.640> but<00:01:15.420> look<00:01:15.869> at

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
in there to rate this one but look at

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.050 
in there to rate this one but look at
the<00:01:16.259> odds<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.830> get<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.009> steam<00:01:17.189> dragon<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.790> does

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
the odds to get the steam dragon it does

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.300 
the odds to get the steam dragon it does
seem<00:01:18.299> lower<00:01:18.659> here<00:01:19.200> but<00:01:19.740> if<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:19.920> look<00:01:20.040> at<00:01:20.159> all

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
seem lower here but if you look at all

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.789 
seem lower here but if you look at all
the<00:01:20.460> odds<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:21.060> get<00:01:21.150> all<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.450> other<00:01:21.479> stuff

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 
the odds to get all the other stuff

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:25.429 
the odds to get all the other stuff
they're<00:01:22.799> pretty<00:01:23.009> low<00:01:23.340> too<00:01:24.229> right<00:01:25.229> now<00:01:25.380> the

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
they're pretty low too right now the

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.710 
they're pretty low too right now the
highest<00:01:26.130> chance<00:01:26.549> are<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.030> highest<00:01:27.210> of<00:01:27.689> the

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
highest chance are the highest of the

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.390 
highest chance are the highest of the
most<00:01:27.990> likely<00:01:28.350> draggy<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.710> get<00:01:28.920> out<00:01:29.130> of<00:01:29.280> this

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
most likely draggy to get out of this

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.730 
most likely draggy to get out of this
whole<00:01:29.670> bunch<00:01:29.970> based<00:01:30.780> on<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.200> statistics<00:01:31.650> of

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
whole bunch based on the statistics of

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.210 
whole bunch based on the statistics of
the<00:01:31.799> odds<00:01:32.040> is<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:33.030> steam<00:01:33.240> dragon<00:01:33.780> so<00:01:34.770> I<00:01:35.130> don't

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
the odds is the steam dragon so I don't

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.890 
the odds is the steam dragon so I don't
know<00:01:35.430> so<00:01:35.759> I'm<00:01:35.820> gonna<00:01:35.909> try<00:01:36.180> that<00:01:36.420> for<00:01:36.600> next<00:01:36.810> time

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
know so I'm gonna try that for next time

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.740 
know so I'm gonna try that for next time
I<00:01:37.259> really<00:01:37.920> hate<00:01:38.070> my<00:01:38.220> pure<00:01:38.400> dragon<00:01:38.640> these<00:01:39.540> guys
