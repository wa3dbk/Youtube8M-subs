00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.660
 [Music] 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.330
 or 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.010
 who loves you are here I bring you 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.110
 a video and today we are going to see a 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.179
 video that the truth gave me then 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.939
 pretty excited to go up because it's 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:18.439
 Yes mine a mine in minecraft and 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:19.790
 as it is a mine for those who do not know 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:21.529
 so in real life is a mother who 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:24.050
 put on the floor and when someone passes 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.670
 she puts explodes near as many 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.480
 they will know in minecraft this does not happen 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:31.099
 since if for example I grasp dynamite 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.220
 I grab a pressure plate for example 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:36.350
 of this stone I grab a block and 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.500
 I want to do this same thing or I put 50 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.840
 the dynamite I put my block and I put this 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.329
 it takes a long time to explode let's see what 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.770
 is what happens 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:49.690
 1 2 3 4 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.180
 instead with this trick that I'm going to 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.650
 teach the dynamite will explode 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.900
 instantaneously and for this I have done 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.989
 this little good mechanism this is not 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.310
 a mechanism this little scenario for 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.800
 well to show you this what they do 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:04.150
 more or less common look for mines or something 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.470
 so I do not really remember where 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.360
 are the mines I'm a little 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.010
 disoriented because like all this 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.450
 it was very messy then in some 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.760
 pressure plates there are mines and right now 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:16.380
 will see what happens if the 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:19.970
 we pricked so very carefully and 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:23.690
 although apparently now we are going well 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:26.710
 ok we are doing pretty well eh I did not stay 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:29.330
 no mine does enough 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.880
 as you can see just touch the plate to 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.710
 pressure as the mine exploded and right now 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.630
 let's see this in more detail 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.050
 because even here not to bbb 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.460
 I see or I fall ipom in the instant and 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.600
 so good people how to build 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.940
 this first of all we will need 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.830
 rails of which I am I recommend to 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.810
 the normal ones to not spend many 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.910
 materials and if they are doing 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.060
 this in survival a wagon with 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.619
 dynamite a dispenser and loads of 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.229
 fire where the faces of the fire are 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:59.000
 here is with a coarse so that once 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.590
 that we have this we are going to choose the 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.540
 block we want the floor to be 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.970
 me in this case to choose I do not know stone and 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.820
 let's grab a pressure plate like that 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.810
 that we will connect ready now what is it 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:14.270
 what you have to do, you just have to 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:16.250
 dig 12 and we will finish 12 ok 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.830
 in this way we are going to fit in here another 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.190
 more to put a dispenser here then 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.850
 let's grab rails 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.770
 [Music] 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.300
 rails let's put all real well 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.490
 let's put a main card with dynamite 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.990
 and we are going to put it in this way as 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.570
 can see you are watching the 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.630
 dispenser when dialing with dynamite well 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:37.820
 who came to cover this with grass for 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.650
 so you do not see yourself there is how you can 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.270
 see is pointing the dispenser to 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.910
 main card with dynamite and once you 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.710
 let's get the fire discharge what it does 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.050
 is that when he leaves immediately he goes to 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.460
 explode and not expect anything nothing nothing of 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.170
 time so as you can see I'm going to 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:54.890
 go through here and it will explode 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.820
 instantly ok 12 base points or 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.710
 not even the time to follow 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.960
 walking like if we were running and 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:01.580
 jumping does not give us time but for that 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:05.390
 just what you have to do if 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.740
 they want for example that there are some 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.720
 person who instead of walking like that 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.070
 normal as I go running or even 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.800
 running and jumping the only thing 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:15.650
 have to do is put the dispenser 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.810
 for example around here wait for three 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.180
 four or even five blocks and here 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.740
 put it already when dialing with dynamite and then 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.230
 It would be all because we imagine that here 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:26.750
 step on the pressure plate and what the 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.430
 ball is going to hit the dynamite hit here 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.390
 and this whole part is destroyed then 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.550
 you 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.350
 in what more or less calculating what 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.810
 distance is what you require 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.790
 now I'm going to show you a mechanism that 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.740
 build up here where it is 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.230
 here it is that it is exactly the same 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:44.450
 but in heaven then how would it happen 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.240
 if I get to step on something they end up like 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:50.209
 would come to pass the explosion if I'm 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.590
 in heaven and how will that affect me 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:53.840
 if they were superior in all 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.690
 let's imagine that I'm walking point 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.190
 break fall death ok 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.560
 how can you see this is pretty 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.330
 destructive and therefore can not be 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.390
 serve to make trolls or not be some 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:07.730
 thing there then fun I found a 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.900
 trick then quite a lot father 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.569
 teach them why 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:15.329
 because it 's something that very few people know and 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:17.130
 that right now they already know and they are going to 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:18.539
 be able to be doing mines and mines and 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.430
 mines and mines throughout his world of 

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:22.019
 minecraft and it's going to explode 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.009
 instantly so a greeting here 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.810
 I say goodbye I hope you liked it 

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:26.190
 the video if it was like that leave your like and 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.110
 I hope that again the microphone does not 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.740
 I broke down here I say goodbye 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.740
 goodbye
