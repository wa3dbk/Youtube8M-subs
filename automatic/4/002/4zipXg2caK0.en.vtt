00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 Good video lesson is showing you how 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.760
 We make a universal charger for 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.349
 any type of cell phone battery and the 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.540
 material is very simple 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.540
 it's a loss comes here in the drawer 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:24.210
 was a hair clip those slow it 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:26.220
 the woman and some wires and a part of the 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.859
 of gps but may have to rise 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.349
 replaced by anything else that 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:37.129
 I got the gps power input 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:40.579
 who was all fucked already and take it out here 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:40.579
 explains the document 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:58.620
 here to make a video not a bite 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.170
 like and should be easy disassembled 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:05.159
 He does it again so I have a 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:09.570
 clamp that holds the 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:12.740
 on the motherboard in the case and 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:18.180
 tape to distinguish positive negative 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:22.590
 here is the output of the gps undock it 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:26.420
 was the v3 am two children here too 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.979
 the same scheme he the pectin 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:31.530
 embodying the motherboard and seeing the opposite 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.460
 then the male and female team marcio 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.820
 champion 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:39.000
 Come here, there's no way you could go wrong. 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:46.759
 exhaustive connecting here 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:49.649
 the computer cable at home ready 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:52.829
 the charger will have your account 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.000
 here have a boys family entrance and 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:58.430
 output 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.430
 we have the negative thing that positive 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:07.250
 training here 5 volts al 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.250
 the output of the pc 

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:20.599
 What about who is're seeing is 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:26.110
 of the business itself at 5 volts output is that 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:30.560
 We'll do it, will we? 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:33.220
 positive and negative do as it is 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:37.129
 male and female then you will be able to generate 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:45.230
 until it is half fixed and the positive does not 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:58.160
 need to turn grant in cash and will 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:03:00.349
 To stay here I swam and itaÃº and a cd gave 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.980
 understand the plot you understand that the 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:06.280
 people are going to do is put here I do not 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.280
 drums 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:41.910
 and so will be the entry into scene 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:43.590
 respect to the exit and then change 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.690
 with the on and off you can put 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.370
 right because always important 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:55.920
 used in other projects 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:04:12.960
 and here is the province as a clamp and already 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:18.540
 It has a strength in itself and said it will 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:22.130
 It is not getting a direct touch from here. 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:25.950
 carries another project I have is the 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:33.240
 cell battery behind the flashlight 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:38.130
 normal led has nine led and one force 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:42.210
 much higher than it would with cell then O 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:46.620
 It was easy, I was 12 years old here 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:49.500
 This part of the load 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:52.220
 not very cool because it claims new battery 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:54.330
 or any other type of project has 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.640
 have any questions you can post on 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.410
 comments or even if you want me to 

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.150
 Make another one of your disassemble everything here. 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.250
 I do it again, explaining it right. 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.910
 how is that only from that choice 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:04.910
 See you
