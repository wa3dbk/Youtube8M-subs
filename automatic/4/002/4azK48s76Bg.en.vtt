00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.470
 hello my ladies and gentlemen and 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:11.700
 Welcome back to let's play 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:13.280
 w13 the omnibus mode we are 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:19.350
 arrived 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:22.470
 at the first paperboy extreme u is now 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:28.080
 so it will be really extreme and the 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:31.320
 Bike ride matches start at extreme 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.969
 rules or generally in the pay per 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.850
 I want to make views so I explain 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:38.300
 I just do not do it now 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.680
 People are just like that 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.969
 as with the other shows 100 list then 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.670
 but I will play you all 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.770
 matches show a paper co 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.079
 but do not play a victory 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.600
 but always let the kg play but 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.520
 I show the match in that you see 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.020
 and I play like that for every match 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.570
 a video 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.280
 I do not know if that really works out 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.469
 Of course, it always depends on how 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.880
 long the matches last and now 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:12.930
 Let's have a look at the line-up 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:17.939
 extreme match number one match against 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:21.270
 katie kate winslet is collected correctly 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:24.060
 fat and a really fiery white 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.600
 opener because the two turned on in 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.130
 an inferno with 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:35.700
 So it really gets right right 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:38.400
 extremely the second match also an older one 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.229
 human the british bulldog is fighting against 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.070
 We already had the match with Rustock 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:47.909
 times saw in a one on one match 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:51.470
 that occurs against bate barrel as well 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:54.750
 in a normal one-on-one match 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:57.080
 So that's what it has ever been his 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.320
 first occurs in a paper 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:04.970
 Although the newcomer is not about a 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:09.259
 title but at least one person had 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:11.540
 a preview and then a match around the 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.030
 united states championship 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.610
 that could include sarahs include this 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.210
 match but the 10k brought the match 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.210
 won 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:24.530
 around the new baumann contender and kicks 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:28.910
 against santino marella also in 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.980
 an inferno my god the highflyer 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.570
 against santino marella in one 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.480
 distance some of that will be something 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:41.090
 my ladies and gentlemen europe my 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:43.400
 we scholli we prefer to match only five 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:47.570
 and that is a day team match in the 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:50.270
 end effect team championship around the wwe 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:52.730
 day team championship santino marella 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:55.310
 and zack ryder against bremen and epic 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.530
 under santino marella has two matches 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:01.090
 tonight and then with 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:03.739
 security are weakened in the second 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.670
 that works 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.410
 maybe there's that, I mean, yes 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.019
 already an announcement on one 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:14.090
 title change here what the wwe tag team 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:18.510
 championship tackle my face that 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:20.370
 There's no such thing as me at this point 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.800
 for santino marella our little one but 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.880
 Maybe maybe they can do it 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.510
 we will see 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.430
 So in a techteam table with the 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.549
 The opponent must be through the table 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.870
 So through the table by play 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:36.390
 be close anyway 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.849
 that promises to be interesting 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.440
 ladies and gentlemen 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:44.849
 and then we have match number 61 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:46.010
 Euro is at john cena against the man 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:50.099
 more 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:53.130
 mark henry in a normal one against 

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:57.959
 One becomes and now we come to the main 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:04:01.290
 match of this evening match number 7 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:08.900
 and the main fight with the first paper like 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:13.500
 at extreme rules the plate in one 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:17.370
 inferno with dad daddy my ladies and 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:19.799
 mens lag hopper was a better main 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:23.669
 Event there was almost no wish 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:26.669
 but many inferno matches this bible 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:28.710
 So I have set in my 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:30.720
 universe mode that page stream hools 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.610
 the last match the main event always 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.500
 an inferno match is but that was still 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:38.870
 it will be up to current negotiations 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:42.230
 are and I can I to madness 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:48.080
 okay that 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:51.940
 The line up for extreme want there can 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:55.460
 you are always looking forward to a lot 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.750
 So that the page had yes in an open 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.550
 content sometime become 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.380
 neither can anyone 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.550
 revenue contender match won 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:05.720
 however, that does not seem like it 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:08.450
 at this extreme then probably more 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:11.210
 next so my ladies and gentlemen that 

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:16.730
 was here mates something 05 with the line 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:19.150
 up of extras and in the next part of the 

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:25.700
 Also today, there is no panic 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:29.390
 today 18.30 it starts with boards 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:33.110
