00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:30.239 
inhalable from about two weeks ago by

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:32.810 
inhalable from about two weeks ago by
Paul<00:00:30.660> claiming<00:00:31.439> that<00:00:31.649> we<00:00:32.160> haven't<00:00:32.430> found<00:00:32.640> this

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820

Paul claiming that we haven't found this
egg<00:00:33.059> in<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.660> second<00:00:34.050> mission<00:00:34.260> yet<00:00:34.620> but<00:00:35.309> I

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
egg in the second mission yet but I

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.130 
egg in the second mission yet but I
guess<00:00:35.820> Paul<00:00:36.120> didn't<00:00:36.510> know<00:00:36.600> that<00:00:36.840> this<00:00:36.960> was

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
guess Paul didn't know that this was

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.110 
guess Paul didn't know that this was
actually<00:00:37.290> family<00:00:37.769> like<00:00:38.309> two<00:00:38.550> weeks<00:00:38.820> of<00:00:39.030> the

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
actually family like two weeks of the

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.119 
actually family like two weeks of the
game<00:00:39.269> coming<00:00:39.570> out<00:00:39.659> but<00:00:40.379> I<00:00:40.409> didn't<00:00:41.010> actually

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
game coming out but I didn't actually

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.850 
game coming out but I didn't actually
what<00:00:41.489> was<00:00:41.699> found<00:00:42.120> was<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.809> gift<00:00:43.079> that<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:43.649> got

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
what was found was the gift that you got

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.220 
what was found was the gift that you got
once<00:00:44.159> you<00:00:44.339> did<00:00:44.640> this<00:00:44.790> egg<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.360> I'm<00:00:45.839> assuming

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
once you did this egg and I'm assuming

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.540 
once you did this egg and I'm assuming
you<00:00:46.290> guys<00:00:46.350> know<00:00:46.649> what<00:00:46.769> to<00:00:46.860> do<00:00:47.010> you<00:00:47.190> kill<00:00:47.399> the

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
you guys know what to do you kill the

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.610 
you guys know what to do you kill the
active<00:00:47.879> camera<00:00:48.089> we<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:48.750> then<00:00:48.930> you<00:00:49.079> walk<00:00:49.320> back

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
active camera we and then you walk back

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.680 
active camera we and then you walk back
in<00:00:49.860> the<00:00:49.949> mission<00:00:50.339> a<00:00:50.460> phantom<00:00:51.000> comes<00:00:51.269> down<00:00:51.510> with

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
in the mission a phantom comes down with

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.320 
in the mission a phantom comes down with
a<00:00:51.930> deletes<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:52.710> gotta<00:00:52.949> kill<00:00:53.309> that<00:00:53.549> but

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:54.330 
a deletes and you gotta kill that but

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.149 
a deletes and you gotta kill that but
I'm<00:00:54.510> assuming<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.530> you<00:00:55.710> guys<00:00:55.860> actually

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:56.159 
I'm assuming that you guys actually

00:00:56.159 --> 00:00:58.369 
I'm assuming that you guys actually
don't<00:00:56.670> know<00:00:56.879> what<00:00:57.150> you<00:00:57.330> get<00:00:57.570> once<00:00:57.869> you<00:00:58.049> kill

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
don't know what you get once you kill

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.740 
don't know what you get once you kill
all<00:00:58.589> eight<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:59.100> these<00:00:59.189> elites<00:00:59.580> pay<00:01:00.299> attention

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
all eight of these elites pay attention

special gift that I'm assuming they

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:36.289 
special gift that I'm assuming they
wanted<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.499> actually<00:01:34.829> spawn<00:01:35.189> with<00:01:35.909> us<00:01:36.090> is

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
wanted to actually spawn with us is

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.770 
wanted to actually spawn with us is
glitch<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.889> you<00:01:38.340> can<00:01:38.520> only<00:01:38.700> mod<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.420> get<00:01:39.659> it

glitch and you can only mod to get it

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.039 
glitch and you can only mod to get it
yeah<00:01:40.109> it's<00:01:40.439> stupid<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:41.369> know<00:01:41.429> don't<00:01:42.420> ask<00:01:42.600> me<00:01:42.899> how

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
yeah it's stupid I know don't ask me how

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.520 
yeah it's stupid I know don't ask me how
they<00:01:43.229> glitched<00:01:43.560> an<00:01:43.770> egg<00:01:44.149> it<00:01:45.149> I'm<00:01:45.929> assuming<00:01:46.079> is

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
they glitched an egg it I'm assuming is

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.060 
they glitched an egg it I'm assuming is
an<00:01:46.710> egg<00:01:46.889> obviously<00:01:47.520> is<00:01:47.639> an<00:01:47.789> accident<00:01:48.359> but

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
an egg obviously is an accident but

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.040 
an egg obviously is an accident but
I<00:01:49.100> guess<00:01:49.820> they<00:01:50.030> don't<00:01:50.150> know<00:01:50.450> it's<00:01:50.690> good<00:01:50.900> to

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
I guess they don't know it's good to

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:52.780 
I guess they don't know it's good to
that's<00:01:51.620> why<00:01:51.770> they<00:01:51.920> gave<00:01:52.070> us<00:01:52.220> a<00:01:52.340> hint<00:01:52.550> that's

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.350 
that's why they gave us a hint that's
why<00:01:52.910> Paul<00:01:53.210> gave<00:01:53.840> us<00:01:53.990> a<00:01:54.140> hint<00:01:54.350> but<00:01:55.190> uh<00:01:55.220> Paul<00:01:55.670> the

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
why Paul gave us a hint but uh Paul the

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.270 
why Paul gave us a hint but uh Paul the
egg<00:01:56.540> is<00:01:56.720> good<00:01:57.490> why<00:01:58.490> how<00:01:58.850> do<00:01:58.910> you<00:01:59.030> think<00:01:59.180> okay
