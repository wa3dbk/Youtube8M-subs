00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.460
 I wore pants I made signs 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.110
 where he wanted to go to change then a 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.930
 I don't like it like a knee salami 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:24.300
 I went to do two dots 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:26.340
 here I think one of liszt rafi will do it 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.390
 precisely at this point then I go 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:34.220
 put under and with the piece of 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:41.250
 glass paper I hope to make me the real fairies 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:43.890
 affect the area because if you decide 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:53.340
 you if you do it lightly if you do it right 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:55.050
 ripping short as you like you I 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:04.670
 I know I have to go and delete these 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:04.670
 two marked is not easy to show you 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:43.229
 I practically have fingers with dowels 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:43.229
 I'm going to scratch and go on 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.349
 you see that threads begin to appear 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.349
 under 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:22.189
 so we are with a point a very thing 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:24.560
 faster than though if it only seems that a 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:28.400
 let you see I still have to keep 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:33.459
 a position that does not allow me to 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:39.709
 scratch the right perception of chance 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:41.690
 and let's continue to be filettini 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.069
 whites therefore we are now present in the 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.349
 territory if we didn't want shell is 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:48.769
 simply the effect so a little 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:51.799
 crumpled once you scratch it 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:54.409
 get to this point you can go 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:58.280
 to pull all the threads from inside with 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:03:05.389
 the hand I'm going to attract them so that it does 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:07.700
 just the effect of redeemed jeans 

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:11.680
 tear not only the funny pain you are born 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.680
 ends that is bad to see in my opinion 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:23.650
 certainly the zoom and and pull all the wires 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.650
 a way to do this effect 

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.650
 frayed 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.750
 those that are so matured 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:37.860
 they start washing 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:41.380
 a shame that is fake all I'm working 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:45.670
 however, the effect remains 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:47.590
 like when we buy them like this 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.560
 time you did monsters 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:53.560
 boon that you point treated the whole thing 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.950
 it remains this way I have done several 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.950
 rips 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:02.770
 all here and the part behind is fine 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:05.110
 maresca take me back then go you a 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:08.680
 pull all the fillets as you like 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:10.750
 however, even a little more tender 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.940
 to enlarge it it was preferred to enlarge it 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:17.350
 raffa, however, to see with a living hand 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:19.540
 complicated enough though you see that 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.519
 eventually they will also tend to 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.320
 there were enough to expand on their own 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:24.700
 points that have not really made filers 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.580
 points 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.020
 and instead like these that came more 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.280
 studied and the points I left 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:36.490
 instead closed in the meantime ruined above 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:37.660
 because this also and therefore in the end 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.120
 this is 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:43.030
 is the end result of what they are 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:51.280
 come the pants I'll show you 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:53.730
 also see below and I also did it from 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.730
 this part 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:02.530
 see here these i was thinking of 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:06.960
 to enlarge or to enlarge them or to 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:10.000
 I do not know how to add more below 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:14.110
 I'm still thinking about this 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:19.870
 what in the end the result 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:22.120
 however this is complete here every 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.410
 I add again here 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:33.820
 but I also like anm in the end 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:36.160
 so and this is this result in 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:37.150
 common ft like very much summer i hope 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.380
 which you like too 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.380
 hello girls
