00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:08.510
 regulation of the cell cycle when 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:11.059
 conditions are optimal some cells 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:13.940
 Prokaryotes can be divided every 20 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:16.309
 minutes the generation times of the 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.740
 eukaryotic cells are usually 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:21.470
 longer although the frequency of the 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.570
 cell division varies between species and 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.420
 between different tissues of it 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.359
 species under optimal conditions of 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.490
 nutrition temperature and ph duration 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:34.489
 of the eukaryotic cell cycle is 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:36.620
 constant for each cell type without 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.530
 However, under less 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.739
 favorable generation time can 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.659
 be greater there are some molecules 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:46.790
 regulators common to all 

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:49.879
 eukaryotes that control the cycle 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.699
 cellular genetically programmed in the 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:54.260
 cell nucleus these molecules 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:56.000
 regulators are part of the system of 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.129
 control of the cell cycle that 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.339
 found in such diverse organisms 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:04.159
 like yeasts clams frogs beings 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:06.560
 human and plant regulators 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.719
 Molecules trigger a sequence 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.460
 of specific events during the cycle 

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:11.830
 mobile 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.200
 since a failure to control the 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.510
 cell division would have consequences 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.270
 disastrous the signals of these 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.670
 genetic programs called points of 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.619
 control of the cell cycle allow 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.200
 all the events of a stage in 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:28.720
 particularly they are completed before 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.390
 to begin the next stage by 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.060
 example if a cell produces damaged DNA 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.220
 or not replicated the cell cycle it 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.220
 interrupts and the cell will not proceed with 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:41.110
 mitosis among the molecules that 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.960
 intervene in the regulation of the cycle 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.360
 cellular proteins stand out us 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.940
 enzymes that activate one activate other 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:52.030
 proteins by phosphorylation by adding them 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.789
 phosphate groups the proteins involved 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.160
 in the control of the cell cycle are the 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:59.649
 proteins as cyclin-dependent 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:03.820
 abbreviated by its acronym in English as 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:05.710
 cdk the activity of various cdk increases 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.709
 and then it decreases as the 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.959
 cell advances in the cell cycle the 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:13.110
 cdk are activated only when they join 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:15.530
 strongly to some regulatory proteins 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.200
 called cyclin 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.990
 when a specific decade ago 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:24.770
 associated with a specific cyclin form 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:27.890
 the complex cyclin cdk complexes 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.660
 cyclin cdk2 forlan enzymes and others 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.400
 proteins 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:34.510
 some of these proteins are activated 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.760
 once phosphorylated and others are inactivated 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:42.050
 the eukaryotic cells form four 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:45.319
 main complexes cyclin cdk each 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:48.709
 cdk cyclin complex phosphorylates a group 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:50.920
 different from proteins the mcd complex 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.030
 that promotes the events of mitosis 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.430
 including the condensation of 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.590
 chromosomes the disintegration of the 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.950
 nuclear envelope and the formation of 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:03.560
 mitotic spindle the mc complex here 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.230
 near the end of the goal phase also 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.300
 activates another enzyme complex the 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.150
 promoter complex of the anh phase 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.940
 known as apc by its acronym in 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.530
 English the initial apc to anna phase 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.900
 allowing the degradation of 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.000
 kitchens and other proteins that keep 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.710
 united the chromatic sisters during 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.020
 the goal phase 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:25.730
 this causes the chromatic sisters 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:28.700
 separate to give rise to two 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.920
 chromosomes children at this point the 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.380
 Cyclin degrades to very high levels 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.420
 low and the activity of the mc complex 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.760
 decade decreases to allow the 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:41.110
 mitotic spindle is fragmented and that the 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.110
 cell terminates mitosis
