00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
want to connect all these I just fill

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:54.039 
want to connect all these I just fill
these<00:02:51.500> blocks<00:02:51.709> in<00:02:51.950> the<00:02:52.099> second<00:02:52.489> and<00:02:53.060> yes<00:02:53.720> he's

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
these blocks in the second and yes he's

00:02:54.049 --> 00:03:00.100 
these blocks in the second and yes he's
connected<00:02:54.709> all<00:02:54.829> you<00:02:55.280> should<00:02:55.519> all<00:02:55.700> extend<00:02:59.110> and

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
connected all you should all extend and

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.690 
connected all you should all extend and
you<00:03:00.140> want<00:03:00.379> to<00:03:00.470> have<00:03:00.560> all<00:03:00.769> the<00:03:00.950> extender<00:03:01.519> you

you want to have all the extender you
want<00:03:01.879> to<00:03:01.939> just<00:03:02.060> break<00:03:02.209> this<00:03:02.390> piston<00:03:02.870> and<00:03:03.530> do

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
want to just break this piston and do

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.619 
want to just break this piston and do
that<00:03:03.799> because<00:03:04.280> this<00:03:04.640> block<00:03:04.819> can't<00:03:05.150> extend

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:05.629 
that because this block can't extend

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:07.690 
that because this block can't extend
this<00:03:05.870> one<00:03:06.019> because<00:03:06.379> it's<00:03:06.530> only<00:03:07.370> open<00:03:07.519> this

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
this one because it's only open this

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.509 
this one because it's only open this
chef<00:03:07.970> it<00:03:08.780> powers<00:03:09.260> this<00:03:09.769> and<00:03:10.040> it<00:03:10.129> has<00:03:10.250> to<00:03:10.370> have<00:03:10.489> a

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
chef it powers this and it has to have a

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.259 
chef it powers this and it has to have a
block<00:03:10.730> over<00:03:10.970> it<00:03:11.590> so<00:03:12.590> next<00:03:12.799> one<00:03:13.010> you<00:03:13.970> can<00:03:14.000> keep

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
block over it so next one you can keep

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:16.000 
block over it so next one you can keep
this<00:03:14.510> piston<00:03:15.079> but<00:03:15.379> that's<00:03:15.530> the<00:03:15.620> only<00:03:15.799> one<00:03:15.890> you

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
this piston but that's the only one you

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.349 
this piston but that's the only one you
can<00:03:16.159> keep<00:03:16.310> so<00:03:16.489> you<00:03:16.519> want<00:03:16.700> to<00:03:16.790> connect<00:03:17.120> it<00:03:17.209> again

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:19.359 
can keep so you want to connect it again

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:23.410 
can keep so you want to connect it again
it<00:03:20.359> all<00:03:20.599> extend<00:03:21.200> and<00:03:21.799> you're<00:03:22.670> almost<00:03:23.030> done

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:27.799 
make like a death trap or something you

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:30.009 
make like a death trap or something you
can<00:03:27.889> just<00:03:28.099> dig<00:03:28.730> this<00:03:28.879> whole<00:03:29.060> floor<00:03:29.299> out<00:03:29.540> and

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
can just dig this whole floor out and

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:32.979 
can just dig this whole floor out and
pull<00:03:30.200> all<00:03:30.379> winter<00:03:30.620> you<00:03:31.180> so<00:03:32.180> let's<00:03:32.329> see<00:03:32.510> it<00:03:32.720> end

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:32.989 
pull all winter you so let's see it end

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:37.390 
pull all winter you so let's see it end
right<00:03:33.349> here<00:03:33.650> so<00:03:34.510> yep<00:03:35.799> let's<00:03:36.799> dig<00:03:36.980> one<00:03:37.220> more

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
right here so yep let's dig one more

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.819 
right here so yep let's dig one more
layer<00:03:37.579> down<00:03:40.840> so<00:03:41.840> let's<00:03:42.019> get<00:03:42.109> some<00:03:42.290> lava<00:03:42.650> right

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:42.829 
layer down so let's get some lava right

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:45.849 
layer down so let's get some lava right
here<00:03:43.099> and<00:03:43.480> then<00:03:44.480> we<00:03:45.019> could<00:03:45.260> place<00:03:45.530> it<00:03:45.709> down

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:45.859 
here and then we could place it down

you'll<00:04:00.919> see<00:04:01.129> why<00:04:01.480> so<00:04:02.480> there's<00:04:02.750> a<00:04:02.810> lot<00:04:02.959> over<00:04:03.230> it

00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:03.349 
you'll see why so there's a lot over it

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:06.479 
you'll see why so there's a lot over it
and<00:04:03.530> also<00:04:04.099> in<00:04:04.370> crafting<00:04:04.790> tables<00:04:05.090> won't<00:04:05.269> burn

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
and also in crafting tables won't burn

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:09.280 
and also in crafting tables won't burn
because<00:04:07.489> yeah<00:04:08.120> even<00:04:08.540> though<00:04:08.629> it's<00:04:08.810> wood<00:04:09.019> it's

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
because yeah even though it's wood it's

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.800 
because yeah even though it's wood it's
kind<00:04:09.470> of<00:04:09.500> stupid<00:04:09.680> it<00:04:09.949> doesn't<00:04:10.040> burn<00:04:10.599> once<00:04:11.599> all

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
kind of stupid it doesn't burn once all

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.420 
kind of stupid it doesn't burn once all
this<00:04:12.019> off<00:04:12.199> the<00:04:12.319> table

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.280 

okay<00:04:16.430> so<00:04:16.489> the<00:04:16.700> reason<00:04:17.060> why<00:04:17.480> I<00:04:17.510> put<00:04:17.840> crafted<00:04:18.019> OHS

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
okay so the reason why I put crafted OHS

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.320 
okay so the reason why I put crafted OHS
on<00:04:18.470> you<00:04:18.610> if<00:04:19.610> you<00:04:19.730> fall<00:04:19.910> in<00:04:19.970> love<00:04:20.000> when<00:04:20.269> you

just<00:05:08.600> put<00:05:08.750> slabs<00:05:09.050> like<00:05:09.230> this<00:05:09.590> so<00:05:09.980> they<00:05:10.130> can't

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
just put slabs like this so they can't

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.550 
just put slabs like this so they can't
walk<00:05:10.430> onto<00:05:10.940> that<00:05:11.180> block<00:05:11.360> then<00:05:12.200> you<00:05:12.290> can<00:05:12.440> make

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
walk onto that block then you can make

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.240 
walk onto that block then you can make
the<00:05:12.680> ceiling<00:05:13.480> it's<00:05:14.480> not<00:05:14.630> like<00:05:14.780> that<00:05:14.900> you<00:05:15.250> can

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250 
the ceiling it's not like that you can

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.110 
the ceiling it's not like that you can
just<00:05:16.370> make<00:05:16.490> a<00:05:16.550> ceiling<00:05:16.970> like<00:05:17.120> this<00:05:18.070> go<00:05:19.070> over

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
just make a ceiling like this go over

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.350 
just make a ceiling like this go over
everything<00:05:20.770> and<00:05:21.770> yeah<00:05:22.070> you're<00:05:22.280> almost<00:05:23.000> done
