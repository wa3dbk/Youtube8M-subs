00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.490
 rest there with the Mt 09 plotter them 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.490
 latest models from yamaha 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:17.300
 with a machine enough 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:19.480
 interesting cuckoo it's me 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.480
 machine 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.680
 Well I'm going down I'm 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:32.160
 currently while of the fast lane 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.739
 [Music] 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.410
 above Gambetta we have it ethan 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.720
 kath and the musicians I like to lead 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.739
 in the station I hope you'll have to 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.739
 this memory for bio 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.550
 otherwise I think it's very interesting 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:07.810
 advantage 3 if the man knows we can 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:12.700
 we can we can trust 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:14.910
 to engines we have the regime and the 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.259
 power that is needed in low regime 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:20.220
 as well in bins en route that's what 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:20.220
 is still pretty 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.560
 Well enough here I have a little 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.590
 of reserve on the bubble to the bubble I the 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:34.060
 not especially very aesthetic 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.060
 good after it's a matter of choice 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.190
 it's a matter of choice if not the 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.830
 remains the bubble I did not see them as 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:48.440
 that I would have seen a lot more in 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.440
 adequacy with with fires 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.010
 it's like that 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.580
 he 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:06.899
 so here what for us gives ya 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.899
 won tells m 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.349
 how she feels me there is there 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.349
 no secret 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.670
 we have the hollow complain I think there 

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:26.610
 also on 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:29.579
 the other aspect is what it is 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:33.920
 a mechanical structure that is used 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:33.920
 for the kidneys and that allows to have 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.920
 so that's already and above all to leave 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.150
 of networks 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.150
 we have no diet loss for that 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.909
 there I will put myself in hard mode to certain 

00:02:50.249 --> 00:02:58.920
 that she cabrol 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:03:01.819
 so that's a strong point of the range 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.819
 6 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.230
 and super appreciable 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.500

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:34.629
 but here we have a bike that is 

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:34.629
 comfortable sitting at the time 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:41.069

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:45.150
