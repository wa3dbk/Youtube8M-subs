we<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.400> sparks<00:00:17.910> bring<00:00:18.600> a<00:00:18.660> new<00:00:18.810> ideas<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.260> save

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
we the sparks bring a new ideas to save

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.040 
we the sparks bring a new ideas to save
the<00:00:19.590> world<00:00:19.770> right<00:00:20.730> hand<00:00:20.970> on<00:00:21.090> that<00:00:21.210> seriously

the world right hand on that seriously

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.630 
the world right hand on that seriously
we're<00:00:22.199> not<00:00:22.350> ready<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:22.740> fight<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.039> big<00:00:23.250> one<00:00:23.430> yet

we're not ready to fight the big one yet
yeah<00:00:24.029> I<00:00:24.300> hear<00:00:24.570> enough<00:00:25.019> of<00:00:25.080> those<00:00:25.170> echo<00:00:25.380> fairy

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
yeah I hear enough of those echo fairy

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.679 
yeah I hear enough of those echo fairy
tales<00:00:25.920> and<00:00:26.189> when<00:00:26.939> we<00:00:27.060> talked<00:00:27.210> about<00:00:27.359> today's

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
tales and when we talked about today's

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.140 
tales and when we talked about today's
this<00:00:28.019> you<00:00:28.740> back<00:00:28.980> you<00:00:29.130> up<00:00:29.279> also<00:00:29.880> known<00:00:30.029> as<00:00:30.119> a

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
this you back you up also known as a

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.900 
this you back you up also known as a
super<00:00:30.570> heat<00:00:30.750> energy<00:00:30.990> keeper<00:00:31.619> now<00:00:32.279> it<00:00:32.669> may<00:00:32.759> look

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
super heat energy keeper now it may look

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.060 
super heat energy keeper now it may look
a<00:00:33.000> little<00:00:33.030> flimsy<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.780> you<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:34.559> not<00:00:34.710> realize

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
a little flimsy to you you not realize

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.590 
a little flimsy to you you not realize
this<00:00:35.280> thing<00:00:35.430> is<00:00:35.550> packed<00:00:35.790> with<00:00:36.000> potential

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
this thing is packed with potential

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.910 
this thing is packed with potential
that's<00:00:37.110> right<00:00:37.260> this<00:00:37.739> thing<00:00:37.950> is<00:00:38.129> totally<00:00:39.920> sweet

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
that's right this thing is totally sweet

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.970 
that's right this thing is totally sweet
yeah<00:00:41.640> sweet<00:00:41.879> indeed<00:00:42.629> howdy<00:00:43.260> let's<00:00:43.530> any<00:00:43.770> heat

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
yeah sweet indeed howdy let's any heat

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.100 
yeah sweet indeed howdy let's any heat
through<00:00:44.309> which<00:00:44.700> means<00:00:44.879> it<00:00:45.000> also<00:00:45.329> keeps<00:00:46.020> the

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
through which means it also keeps the

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.139 
through which means it also keeps the
heat<00:00:46.230> energy<00:00:46.440> from<00:00:46.710> escaping<00:00:47.399> keeps<00:00:48.000> on

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
heat energy from escaping keeps on

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.900 
heat energy from escaping keeps on
things<00:00:48.390> huh<00:00:48.570> cool<00:00:49.289> things<00:00:49.500> cool<00:00:49.770> thank<00:00:50.730> you<00:00:50.789> so

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
things huh cool things cool thank you so

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.700 
things huh cool things cool thank you so
much<00:00:50.940> then<00:00:51.690> if<00:00:51.840> you<00:00:51.930> didn't<00:00:52.199> get<00:00:52.350> any<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.680> that

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
much then if you didn't get any of that

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.490 
much then if you didn't get any of that
because<00:00:53.039> kind<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.610> hard<00:00:54.149> for<00:00:54.300> them<00:00:54.660> anyway<00:00:55.110> ok

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
because kind of hard for them anyway ok

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.529 
because kind of hard for them anyway ok
we<00:00:55.680> have<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:55.860> plate<00:00:56.160> here<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.969> we're<00:00:57.360> going<00:00:57.480> to

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
we have a plate here and we're going to

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.810 
we have a plate here and we're going to
show<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:57.719> exactly<00:00:57.840> how<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.440> works<00:00:58.649> so<00:00:59.280> yeah

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
show you exactly how it works so yeah

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.750 
show you exactly how it works so yeah
yeah<00:01:00.270> let<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.050> experiments<00:01:01.530> begin<00:01:02.270> I<00:01:03.270> but

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
yeah let the experiments begin I but

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.280 
yeah let the experiments begin I but
come<00:01:05.760> on<00:01:05.880> that's<00:01:06.540> it's<00:01:06.840> time<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.110> get<00:01:07.170> started

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
come on that's it's time to get started

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
what's up to that we have with these two

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.600 
what's up to that we have with these two
ice<00:01:21.689> cubes<00:01:21.960> underneath<00:01:22.950> one<00:01:23.159> of<00:01:23.189> them<00:01:23.369> have

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
ice cubes underneath one of them have

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.859 
ice cubes underneath one of them have
you<00:01:23.790> back<00:01:24.000> your<00:01:26.210> other<00:01:27.210> other<00:01:27.450> beds<00:01:27.659> really

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
you back your other other beds really

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.569 
you back your other other beds really
necessary<00:01:28.380> ok<00:01:28.829> look<00:01:29.130> at<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.310> it's<00:01:29.430> like<00:01:29.520> a

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
necessary ok look at it it's like a

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.969 
necessary ok look at it it's like a
metaphor<00:01:29.820> ok<00:01:30.390> this<00:01:31.380> represents<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.799> earth

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
metaphor ok this represents the earth

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.450 
metaphor ok this represents the earth
and<00:01:32.310> ok<00:01:33.030> I<00:01:33.150> get<00:01:33.540> it<00:01:33.570> but<00:01:33.750> yeah<00:01:33.930> it<00:01:34.259> will<00:01:35.070> call<00:01:35.280> it
