and<00:02:22.390> finally<00:02:23.110> parrot<00:02:23.560> feathers<00:02:23.879> parrot

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 
and finally parrot feathers parrot

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:26.760 
and finally parrot feathers parrot
feather<00:02:25.060> grows<00:02:25.330> above<00:02:25.840> and<00:02:26.080> below<00:02:26.440> the<00:02:26.470> water

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
feather grows above and below the water

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.740 
feather grows above and below the water
surface<00:02:26.860> and<00:02:27.459> these<00:02:27.730> leaves<00:02:28.060> will<00:02:28.270> spread<00:02:28.540> out

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
surface and these leaves will spread out

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.449 
surface and these leaves will spread out
along<00:02:29.050> the<00:02:29.170> surface<00:02:29.560> of<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:29.739> water<00:02:29.950> and<00:02:30.160> float

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
along the surface of the water and float

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.180 
along the surface of the water and float
on<00:02:30.640> it<00:02:30.819> and<00:02:31.000> they<00:02:31.480> get<00:02:31.660> nice<00:02:32.230> red<00:02:32.530> tips<00:02:32.830> during

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
on it and they get nice red tips during

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.400 
on it and they get nice red tips during
the<00:02:33.280> fall<00:02:33.520> this<00:02:34.420> will<00:02:34.569> come<00:02:34.780> back<00:02:34.930> even<00:02:35.319> though

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
the fall this will come back even though

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:36.869 
the fall this will come back even though
it's<00:02:35.560> considered<00:02:36.040> somewhat<00:02:36.430> of<00:02:36.459> a<00:02:36.670> tropical

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:36.879 
it's considered somewhat of a tropical

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:41.790 
it's considered somewhat of a tropical
plant<00:02:39.510> now<00:02:40.510> we're<00:02:40.660> going<00:02:40.750> to<00:02:40.810> use<00:02:40.870> bricks<00:02:41.379> to

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
plant now we're going to use bricks to

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.410 
plant now we're going to use bricks to
get<00:02:42.040> height<00:02:42.430> for<00:02:42.730> our<00:02:42.819> plants<00:02:43.090> that<00:02:43.269> don't

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
get height for our plants that don't

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.660 
get height for our plants that don't
like<00:02:43.599> a<00:02:43.629> too<00:02:43.930> deep<00:02:44.140> these<00:02:44.500> bricks<00:02:44.830> last<00:02:45.340> year

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
like a too deep these bricks last year

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.369 
like a too deep these bricks last year
we're<00:02:45.940> in<00:02:46.030> a<00:02:46.120> patio<00:02:46.450> this<00:02:46.959> year<00:02:47.200> they're

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:47.379 
we're in a patio this year they're

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:49.290 
we're in a patio this year they're
helping<00:02:47.590> us<00:02:47.769> create<00:02:48.099> a<00:02:48.370> water<00:02:48.819> garden<00:02:49.150> so

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
helping us create a water garden so

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.720 
helping us create a water garden so
we're<00:02:49.450> recycling<00:02:49.900> these<00:02:50.379> they<00:02:51.220> were<00:02:51.280> free

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
we're recycling these they were free

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.820 
we're recycling these they were free
this<00:02:52.569> is<00:02:52.720> a<00:02:52.750> great<00:02:53.019> way<00:02:53.170> to<00:02:53.200> keep<00:02:53.440> us<00:02:53.620> within

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
this is a great way to keep us within

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:59.640 
this is a great way to keep us within
our<00:02:54.069> budget<00:02:54.250> and<00:02:54.580> recycle<00:02:55.540> where<00:02:55.690> we<00:02:55.810> can

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.030 

I'm<00:03:00.650> basically<00:03:00.950> just<00:03:01.250> stacking<00:03:01.940> bricks<00:03:02.180> now

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
I'm basically just stacking bricks now

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.350 
I'm basically just stacking bricks now
to<00:03:04.040> get<00:03:04.190> the<00:03:04.340> height<00:03:04.550> I<00:03:04.580> want<00:03:04.880> to<00:03:04.970> get<00:03:05.120> for

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
to get the height I want to get for

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.820 
to get the height I want to get for
these<00:03:05.480> plants<00:03:05.840> some<00:03:06.200> of<00:03:06.230> them<00:03:06.410> like<00:03:06.620> it<00:03:06.650> a

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
these plants some of them like it a

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.070 
these plants some of them like it a
little<00:03:06.950> bit<00:03:07.160> higher<00:03:07.430> and<00:03:08.330> I<00:03:08.570> want<00:03:08.780> just<00:03:08.960> a

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
little bit higher and I want just a

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.330 
little bit higher and I want just a
little<00:03:09.350> bit<00:03:09.440> of<00:03:09.530> water<00:03:09.680> over<00:03:09.950> the<00:03:10.100> crown<00:03:10.310> of

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
little bit of water over the crown of

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.400 
little bit of water over the crown of
the<00:03:10.550> plant<00:03:10.700> so<00:03:11.390> this<00:03:11.570> looks<00:03:11.840> just<00:03:12.050> about<00:03:12.260> right

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
the plant so this looks just about right

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.690 
the plant so this looks just about right
for<00:03:12.830> the<00:03:12.890> height<00:03:13.070> that<00:03:13.220> we're<00:03:13.400> going<00:03:13.550> for<00:03:15.700> okay

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
for the height that we're going for okay

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.520 
for the height that we're going for okay
here<00:03:16.970> you<00:03:17.030> can<00:03:17.180> see<00:03:17.330> we've<00:03:17.510> packed<00:03:17.840> our<00:03:18.050> gravel

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
here you can see we've packed our gravel

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.650 
here you can see we've packed our gravel
into<00:03:19.220> all<00:03:19.370> the<00:03:19.550> plants<00:03:19.940> we<00:03:20.060> bring<00:03:20.240> it<00:03:20.360> right<00:03:20.600> up

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
into all the plants we bring it right up

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.230 
into all the plants we bring it right up
to<00:03:20.810> the<00:03:20.960> edge<00:03:21.170> and<00:03:21.860> this<00:03:22.040> is<00:03:22.220> to<00:03:22.370> keep<00:03:22.520> soil

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:23.240 
to the edge and this is to keep soil

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.330 
to the edge and this is to keep soil
from<00:03:23.480> getting<00:03:23.810> out<00:03:23.960> fish<00:03:24.620> from<00:03:24.830> getting<00:03:24.890> in

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
from getting out fish from getting in

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.640 
from getting out fish from getting in
and<00:03:25.550> also<00:03:26.090> as<00:03:26.300> a<00:03:26.330> decorative<00:03:26.840> element<00:03:27.110> to<00:03:27.560> it

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
and also as a decorative element to it

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.650 
and also as a decorative element to it
as<00:03:27.770> well

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.900 

for<00:03:32.230> aquatic<00:03:32.560> plants<00:03:32.980> there<00:03:33.160> are<00:03:33.190> liquid

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
for aquatic plants there are liquid

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.030 
for aquatic plants there are liquid
fertilizers<00:03:34.600> and<00:03:34.840> there<00:03:35.170> are<00:03:35.320> tablet

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
fertilizers and there are tablet

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.430 
fertilizers and there are tablet
fertilizers<00:03:36.730> I<00:03:36.940> prefer<00:03:37.570> the<00:03:37.720> tablets<00:03:38.140> because

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
fertilizers I prefer the tablets because

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.930 
fertilizers I prefer the tablets because
they're<00:03:38.590> a<00:03:38.620> lot<00:03:38.770> more<00:03:38.830> direct<00:03:39.340> wave<00:03:39.520> feeding

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
they're a lot more direct wave feeding

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.370 
they're a lot more direct wave feeding
they're<00:03:40.090> actually<00:03:40.390> going<00:03:40.540> right<00:03:40.960> into<00:03:41.140> the

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
they're actually going right into the

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.020 
they're actually going right into the
plant<00:03:41.620> itself<00:03:41.980> whereas<00:03:42.670> the<00:03:42.730> liquid

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
plant itself whereas the liquid

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.000 
plant itself whereas the liquid
fertilizers<00:03:43.630> are<00:03:43.810> going<00:03:44.050> into<00:03:44.200> the<00:03:44.410> pond<00:03:44.650> and

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
fertilizers are going into the pond and

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.740 
fertilizers are going into the pond and
it's<00:03:45.370> going<00:03:45.520> to<00:03:45.610> fertilize<00:03:45.820> plants<00:03:46.480> but<00:03:46.630> it's

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
it's going to fertilize plants but it's

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.420 
it's going to fertilize plants but it's
also<00:03:46.900> going<00:03:47.110> to<00:03:47.170> fertilize<00:03:47.440> algae<00:03:48.010> growth<00:03:48.220> if

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
also going to fertilize algae growth if

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.430 
also going to fertilize algae growth if
you<00:03:48.550> have<00:03:48.670> any<00:03:48.880> excess<00:03:49.630> algae<00:03:49.990> growth<00:03:50.170> in<00:03:50.320> your

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 
you have any excess algae growth in your

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.230 
you have any excess algae growth in your
pond<00:03:50.620> -<00:03:50.860> so<00:03:51.130> this<00:03:51.340> to<00:03:51.550> me<00:03:51.670> is<00:03:51.790> a<00:03:51.820> much<00:03:52.060> more

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:52.240 
pond - so this to me is a much more

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.690 
pond - so this to me is a much more
effective<00:03:52.840> way<00:03:52.900> of<00:03:53.590> fertilizing<00:03:54.160> your<00:03:54.310> plants

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
effective way of fertilizing your plants

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.580 
effective way of fertilizing your plants
and<00:03:54.850> they're<00:03:55.180> really<00:03:55.390> easy<00:03:55.540> to<00:03:55.690> put<00:03:55.810> in<00:03:56.110> let's

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
and they're really easy to put in let's

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.010 
and they're really easy to put in let's
check<00:03:56.800> it<00:03:56.920> out

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 
check it out

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.960 
check it out
the<00:03:59.020> tabs<00:03:59.260> basically<00:03:59.950> are<00:04:00.400> gonna<00:04:00.520> go<00:04:00.760> right

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
the tabs basically are gonna go right

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.660 
the tabs basically are gonna go right
into<00:04:01.150> the<00:04:01.360> plant<00:04:01.600> itself<00:04:02.070> you<00:04:03.070> can<00:04:03.280> push<00:04:03.490> them

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
into the plant itself you can push them

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.550 
into the plant itself you can push them
down<00:04:05.190> into<00:04:06.190> the<00:04:06.310> soil<00:04:07.080> kind<00:04:08.080> of<00:04:08.170> spread<00:04:08.410> your

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
down into the soil kind of spread your

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.470 
down into the soil kind of spread your
gravel<00:04:08.890> back<00:04:09.070> over<00:04:09.400> to<00:04:09.550> keep<00:04:09.700> it<00:04:09.850> in<00:04:09.940> place<00:04:10.180> and

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
gravel back over to keep it in place and

that's it easy stuff here's our aeration
system<00:04:15.520> sounds<00:04:16.180> pretty<00:04:16.390> fancy<00:04:16.840> but<00:04:17.260> it's<00:04:17.410> not

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
system sounds pretty fancy but it's not

this<00:04:29.320> is<00:04:29.470> going<00:04:29.650> to<00:04:29.710> create<00:04:29.950> small<00:04:30.250> air

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
this is going to create small air

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.010 
this is going to create small air
bubbles<00:04:30.490> that<00:04:30.970> will<00:04:31.270> oxygenate<00:04:31.990> and

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
bubbles that will oxygenate and

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.530 
bubbles that will oxygenate and
circulate<00:04:32.710> the<00:04:32.860> water<00:04:32.890> and<00:04:33.400> that's<00:04:34.150> it

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:34.540 
circulate the water and that's it

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.270 
circulate the water and that's it
