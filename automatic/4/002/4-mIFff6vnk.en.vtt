00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:58.240 
so all I do is basically ask their

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.150

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:18.820 
there is there's room for improvement

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.480 
there is there's room for improvement
most<00:06:19.600> definitely<00:06:20.110> I<00:06:20.140> won't<00:06:20.680> put<00:06:21.250> everything

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:21.490

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:28.480 
for improvement but I think for the

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.900 
for improvement but I think for the
first<00:06:28.570> time<00:06:28.900> running<00:06:29.140> especially<00:06:29.830> such<00:06:30.610> a<00:06:30.640> big

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:30.910 
first time running especially such a big

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:34.080 
first time running especially such a big
venue<00:06:31.090> setting<00:06:31.870> setting<00:06:32.470> that<00:06:32.710> bar<00:06:33.280> I<00:06:33.580> think

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:34.090 
venue setting setting that bar I think

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:36.300 
venue setting setting that bar I think
it's<00:06:34.210> really<00:06:34.570> good<00:06:34.810> yeah<00:06:35.140> well<00:06:35.710> let's<00:06:35.919> stop<00:06:36.130> at

it's really good yeah well let's stop at

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:38.530 
it's really good yeah well let's stop at
IPL<00:06:36.760> for<00:06:37.030> what<00:06:37.270> do<00:06:37.330> you<00:06:37.419> want<00:06:37.570> to<00:06:37.660> see<00:06:37.750> changed

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:38.540 
IPL for what do you want to see changed

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.980 
IPL for what do you want to see changed
improved<00:06:39.940> especially<00:06:40.940> with<00:06:41.180> the<00:06:41.330> ustream<00:06:41.690> I

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:41.990 
improved especially with the ustream I

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:43.990 
improved especially with the ustream I
think<00:06:42.680> things<00:06:43.220> need<00:06:43.430> to<00:06:43.460> be<00:06:43.550> a<00:06:43.640> bit<00:06:43.850> more

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:44.000 
think things need to be a bit more

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.310 
think things need to be a bit more
organized<00:06:44.540> especially<00:06:45.380> I<00:06:46.040> think<00:06:47.110> if<00:06:48.110> there

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:48.320 
organized especially I think if there

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.720 
organized especially I think if there
are<00:06:48.410> certain<00:06:48.620> tasks<00:06:49.010> we<00:06:49.100> need<00:06:49.220> to<00:06:49.340> stick<00:06:49.550> by

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:49.730 
are certain tasks we need to stick by

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:52.600 
are certain tasks we need to stick by
that<00:06:49.760> just<00:06:50.510> for<00:06:50.630> courtesy<00:06:50.990> for<00:06:51.140> everyone<00:06:51.610> just

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:52.610 
that just for courtesy for everyone just

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:54.310 
that just for courtesy for everyone just
I<00:06:53.180> think<00:06:53.300> things<00:06:53.720> can<00:06:53.900> be<00:06:54.050> just<00:06:54.230> better

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:54.320 
I think things can be just better

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:57.700 
I think things can be just better
organized<00:06:54.830> mm-hmm<00:06:56.110> same<00:06:57.110> with<00:06:57.260> like<00:06:57.410> food

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:57.710

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:04.660 
everyone's properly fed just little
little<00:07:02.720> quirks<00:07:02.960> I<00:07:03.140> guess<00:07:03.320> yeah<00:07:03.710> it's<00:07:04.400> tough

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:04.670
