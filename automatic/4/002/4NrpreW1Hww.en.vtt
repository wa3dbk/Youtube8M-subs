 Hi, I'm going to talk about my dear 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.249
 shoe line 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.379
 she wanted me to be sold in the 

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:17.840
 practice this time with the neo collection 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:20.720
 basic what the new basic ones mean 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.269
 I was inspired by the street look on people 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.060
 that is on the street the urban tribes 

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:28.130
 of today that are irreverent 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.150
 rebels who follow theater steer are we 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.490
 is always a refreshing proposal 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.020
 visual below I will give them 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.489
 Several tips on how to use these 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.800
 prints to see if they risk a 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:39.050
 little is the navy print or the 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.850
 striped print is one of my cousins 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.550
 favorites because it's super versatile and 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.350
 can be combined with any look has 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.480
 come reinventing himself in his 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.359
 combinations of the 20s or 30s that 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:53.359
 I was going to propose to the market 

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:56.420
 that they use it like a floral pants if 

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:58.640
 you are a sweet or more classic girl a 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.769
 bit quieter you can go as a 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.239
 white shirt and it will join you 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:03.949
 prints and it will reassure you 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.269
 I propose to use the same 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:07.969
 trousers 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.969
 a black shirt with a pattern of 

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:14.390
 animal print the animal print is now 

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:16.039
 Super trendy and is something that can break 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.280
 any look to give you a little more 

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:21.469
 aggression and fun but of the most 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.299
 rich this look you will like this time 

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:25.520
 we are combining the same colors 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:28.159
 but in different patterns or if not 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.170
 you can do combine the two stripes 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:33.289
 combine the prints in different 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.240
 areas you can also go cold animal 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:37.729

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:41.209
