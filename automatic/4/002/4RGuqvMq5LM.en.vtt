 there are some crazy people who play football 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.150
 American did not do very well just 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.400
 against a Yankee university team 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.870
 but the idea of ​​believing continue to grow 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.860
 little by little and little by little they will 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.360
 get 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.360
 [Applause] 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.080
 [Music] 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.670
 in a game that will remain as a 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.189
 milestone in the history of the league the 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.289
 national team the hawks are 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:33.579

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:35.320
 from the pacific university the boxers in 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:37.690
 the second opportunity in which a 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.059
 national team faces a 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.949
 North American country university in 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:44.050
 American football relates it 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:46.900
 directly or with future with the rank 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.059
 that we say comes off basically from 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.829
 these two disciplines is not totally 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:52.540
 different out there has some relation 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:54.970
 with the ranking by the shape of the ball 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.309
 that is not even the same and that is 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.409
 contacts and there are tactile but outside 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.180
 that's not in the rules the sport is 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:02.650
 totally different a new lot you 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.610
 team receives the ball between the team 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.920
 offensive there is an offensive team 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.360
 defensive and special teams that are 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.310
 for kicks when your team 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.340
 offensive has the ball has four 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.630
 opportunities to advance 10 harden and 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.490
 an advance those 10 yards have other 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.650
 four opportunity to throw opprobrious 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.880
 and so on until you get to 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.829
 the other side 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.750
 all of a single move of success to the 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:25.960
 court like three yard power 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:29.970
 advancing to complete and score and 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.970
 six points we will miss this way 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.460
 the presentation of both squads with 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:39.159
 the next thread of the country to which 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.979
 they represent and the fans finished 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:44.729
 to give the perfect day frame so that 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:48.040
 the referee gave the start of the match 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:50.380
 of the moment and of the full sacrifice that 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.030
 means the activity in the country we 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.810
 spoke the maximum referent 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:58.000
 federico poggi most of us work or 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.390
 they work and study some study the 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.450
 more guys therefore we try to train 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.220
 twice a week now in let's say 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.880
 before starting the season three times 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.009
 per week 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.020
 elena more twice in the week 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.190
 We divide this part throughout the whole 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.120
 First part of the year is a lot of load 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:18.250
 physical much work compresses and then 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.530
 during the year is more 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.150
 we focus more on the technique tactics 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.070
 more devoted to what is the party in 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.680
 all this part apart from training all 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.900
 the tactical part we set out to do the 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.570
 Physical preparation lasts the equipment to which 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.160

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.890
 monument of güemes there are many teams 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.870
 also that train there 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.870
 and good the truth that everything that is 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:45.600
 infrastructure be team 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.790
 training we buy ourselves and 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.310
 We try to do our best between 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.170

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:58.940
 similar to what it is then 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:01.620
 and the result of 49 to 0 in favor of the 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.620
 experienced Americans was left in 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:08.100
 anecdote the conclusion is that football 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:11.610
 American from our look dreams of 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.800
 have ever your own audience a 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.590
 named and acquire 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:19.400
 popularity locally and
