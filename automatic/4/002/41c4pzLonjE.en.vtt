easier to travel with and so flat and
it's<00:04:09.470> just<00:04:09.590> easiest<00:04:10.040> be<00:04:10.250> everything<00:04:10.670> and<00:04:10.820> find

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
it's just easiest be everything and find

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:12.490

is<00:04:16.609> new<00:04:16.880> with<00:04:17.739> how<00:04:18.739> I<00:04:18.769> pick<00:04:19.310> out<00:04:19.489> and

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
is new with how I pick out and

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.300 
is new with how I pick out and
coordinate<00:04:20.989> what<00:04:21.169> jewelry<00:04:21.500> I'm<00:04:21.769> bringing<00:04:22.100> and

coordinate what jewelry I'm bringing and

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.110 
coordinate what jewelry I'm bringing and
I<00:04:22.729> just<00:04:23.090> started<00:04:23.390> doing<00:04:23.600> that<00:04:23.720> for<00:04:23.900> this

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
I just started doing that for this

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.659 
I just started doing that for this
trip<00:04:24.300> and<00:04:24.510> really<00:04:25.080> just<00:04:25.800> made<00:04:26.070> it<00:04:26.190> easier<00:04:26.610> I

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
trip and really just made it easier I

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:28.580 
trip and really just made it easier I
mean<00:04:26.910> I<00:04:26.940> know<00:04:27.060> that<00:04:27.330> sounds<00:04:27.630> sort<00:04:27.870> of<00:04:27.960> silly

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
mean I know that sounds sort of silly

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.700 
mean I know that sounds sort of silly
like<00:04:28.949> why<00:04:29.880> would<00:04:30.060> you<00:04:30.180> need<00:04:30.300> to<00:04:30.510> have<00:04:31.110> a<00:04:31.139> method

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
like why would you need to have a method

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.640 
like why would you need to have a method
for<00:04:31.889> packing<00:04:32.280> jewelry<00:04:32.729> but<00:04:32.910> any<00:04:33.570> time<00:04:34.169> I<00:04:34.199> can

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
for packing jewelry but any time I can

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.290 
for packing jewelry but any time I can
save<00:04:35.150> and<00:04:36.150> it<00:04:36.960> just<00:04:37.620> is<00:04:37.830> helpful<00:04:38.669> and<00:04:39.090> I<00:04:39.270> think

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
save and it just is helpful and I think

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.990 
save and it just is helpful and I think
that's<00:04:39.660> true<00:04:39.960> for<00:04:40.169> most<00:04:40.560> people<00:04:41.100> and<00:04:41.340> I<00:04:41.760> like

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
that's true for most people and I like

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.850 
that's true for most people and I like
being<00:04:42.330> able<00:04:42.449> to<00:04:42.600> bring<00:04:42.930> the<00:04:42.960> tray<00:04:43.290> over<00:04:43.500> to

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
being able to bring the tray over to

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.310 
being able to bring the tray over to
where<00:04:44.400> I<00:04:44.460> have<00:04:44.610> my<00:04:44.699> clothes<00:04:44.910> laid<00:04:45.180> out<00:04:45.389> and<00:04:45.780> to

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
where I have my clothes laid out and to

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.080 
where I have my clothes laid out and to
coordinate<00:04:46.560> things<00:04:47.040> and<00:04:47.340> pack<00:04:47.760> them<00:04:47.940> right

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
coordinate things and pack them right

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.120 
coordinate things and pack them right
from<00:04:48.240> there<00:04:48.540> so<00:04:49.470> that<00:04:49.620> worked<00:04:49.830> really<00:04:49.919> well

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
from there so that worked really well

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:51.770 
from there so that worked really well
for<00:04:50.280> me<00:04:50.460> I<00:04:50.580> will<00:04:50.790> probably<00:04:51.120> continue<00:04:51.419> using

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
for me I will probably continue using

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.020 
for me I will probably continue using
