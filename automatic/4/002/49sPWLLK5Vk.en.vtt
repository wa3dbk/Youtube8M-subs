00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.120 
grid you don't have to spend points on
that<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.540> you're<00:01:40.439> going<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.619> be<00:01:40.710> passing<00:01:40.890> up

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
that and you're going to be passing up

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
less squad points in general then you're

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.090

my<00:02:06.360> classes<00:02:06.810> when<00:02:07.439> I'm<00:02:07.530> going<00:02:07.740> for<00:02:08.399> kem

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
my classes when I'm going for kem

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.600 
my classes when I'm going for kem
strikes<00:02:09.569> and<00:02:09.810> so<00:02:10.289> this<00:02:10.679> class<00:02:11.009> is<00:02:11.220> probably

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
strikes and so this class is probably

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.250 
strikes and so this class is probably
what<00:02:11.819> I<00:02:11.849> would<00:02:11.970> choose<00:02:12.150> in<00:02:12.450> fact<00:02:12.690> is<00:02:12.959> what<00:02:13.230> I

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
what I would choose in fact is what I

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.760 
what I would choose in fact is what I
choose

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
choose

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.620 
choose
is<00:02:14.100> what<00:02:14.520> I<00:02:14.550> chew<00:02:14.820> is<00:02:15.000> when<00:02:15.150> I<00:02:15.180> recently

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
is what I chew is when I recently

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.450 
is what I chew is when I recently
prestiged<00:02:16.050> because<00:02:16.770> off<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.070> grid<00:02:17.220> is<00:02:17.310> so

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
prestiged because off the grid is so

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.160 
prestiged because off the grid is so
expensive<00:02:17.910> because<00:02:18.150> I<00:02:18.480> felt<00:02:18.720> like<00:02:18.810> I<00:02:18.930> really

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
expensive because I felt like I really

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.920 
expensive because I felt like I really
wanted<00:02:19.200> it<00:02:19.680> for<00:02:20.070> free<00:02:20.430> because<00:02:21.240> I<00:02:21.480> want<00:02:21.660> to<00:02:21.720> try

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
wanted it for free because I want to try

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.690 
wanted it for free because I want to try
out<00:02:21.990> the<00:02:22.110> honey<00:02:22.260> badger<00:02:22.500> and<00:02:22.800> because<00:02:23.310> i<00:02:23.340> use

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
out the honey badger and because i use

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.270 
out the honey badger and because i use
dead<00:02:23.910> silence<00:02:24.420> all<00:02:24.570> the<00:02:24.930> freaking<00:02:25.440> time<00:02:25.470> now<00:02:26.250> a

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
dead silence all the freaking time now a

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.070 
dead silence all the freaking time now a
class<00:02:26.760> little<00:02:27.060> like<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.330> heavy<00:02:27.510> gunner<00:02:27.780> is

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
class little like the heavy gunner is

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.530 
class little like the heavy gunner is
probably<00:02:28.590> very<00:02:28.710> very<00:02:29.250> unpopular<00:02:29.910> i<00:02:30.180> encourage

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
probably very very unpopular i encourage

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.780 
probably very very unpopular i encourage
you<00:02:30.570> guys<00:02:30.660> to<00:02:30.780> not<00:02:31.590> use<00:02:31.860> it<00:02:32.040> unless<00:02:32.250> you<00:02:32.520> really

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
you guys to not use it unless you really

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.670 
you guys to not use it unless you really
feel<00:02:33.120> like<00:02:33.270> some<00:02:33.450> of<00:02:33.510> these<00:02:33.600> perks<00:02:33.930> are<00:02:34.170> really

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
feel like some of these perks are really

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.310 
feel like some of these perks are really
essential<00:02:34.770> but<00:02:35.400> based<00:02:35.820> on<00:02:36.120> my<00:02:36.390> analysis<00:02:37.170> of

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
essential but based on my analysis of

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.290 
essential but based on my analysis of
the<00:02:37.410> game<00:02:37.560> so<00:02:37.800> far<00:02:38.040> I<00:02:38.280> don't<00:02:38.670> think<00:02:38.880> very<00:02:39.060> many

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
the game so far I don't think very many

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.780 
the game so far I don't think very many
of<00:02:39.480> these<00:02:39.600> perks<00:02:39.900> are<00:02:40.110> maybe<00:02:40.530> hardline<00:02:41.100> maybe

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
of these perks are maybe hardline maybe

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.120 
of these perks are maybe hardline maybe
ping<00:02:42.150> ping<00:02:42.450> is<00:02:42.570> a<00:02:42.600> pretty<00:02:42.810> solid<00:02:43.080> Park<00:02:43.410> but<00:02:44.070> it

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
ping ping is a pretty solid Park but it

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.860 
ping ping is a pretty solid Park but it
only<00:02:44.250> cost<00:02:44.580> like<00:02:44.670> six<00:02:45.030> squad<00:02:45.270> points<00:02:45.450> or<00:02:45.690> maybe

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
only cost like six squad points or maybe

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.420 
only cost like six squad points or maybe
even<00:02:45.960> lesson<00:02:46.620> on<00:02:46.710> somewhere<00:02:47.040> around<00:02:47.130> there

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
even lesson on somewhere around there

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.580 
even lesson on somewhere around there
but<00:02:47.820> it's<00:02:47.940> not<00:02:48.030> as<00:02:48.270> expensive<00:02:48.600> as<00:02:48.810> others<00:02:49.380> so<00:02:49.560> I

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
but it's not as expensive as others so I

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.410 
but it's not as expensive as others so I
don't<00:02:49.650> think<00:02:49.950> that<00:02:50.160> loadout<00:02:50.880> is<00:02:51.090> probably

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
don't think that loadout is probably

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.610 
don't think that loadout is probably
going<00:02:51.540> to<00:02:51.600> be<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:51.810> best<00:02:51.990> for<00:02:52.230> most<00:02:52.380> of<00:02:52.500> you

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
going to be the best for most of you

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.890 
going to be the best for most of you
guys<00:02:52.650> however<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.910> marksman<00:02:54.420> loadout<00:02:54.720> right

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
guys however the marksman loadout right

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.960 
guys however the marksman loadout right
here<00:02:55.230> this<00:02:55.620> is<00:02:55.800> interesting<00:02:56.310> because<00:02:56.490> it<00:02:56.790> does

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
here this is interesting because it does

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.120 
here this is interesting because it does

give you amplify and focus for free

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.090 
give you amplify and focus for free
which<00:02:59.550> in<00:02:59.700> my<00:02:59.910> mind<00:02:59.940> are<00:03:00.390> very<00:03:01.020> very<00:03:01.470> necessary

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
which in my mind are very very necessary

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.160 
which in my mind are very very necessary
focus<00:03:02.850> is<00:03:03.060> the<00:03:03.270> most<00:03:03.450> important<00:03:03.840> perk<00:03:03.960> in<00:03:04.080> the

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
focus is the most important perk in the

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.170 
focus is the most important perk in the
game<00:03:04.320> in<00:03:04.500> my<00:03:04.590> opinion<00:03:04.620> as<00:03:05.490> you<00:03:05.670> guys<00:03:05.760> know<00:03:05.820> from

game in my opinion as you guys know from

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.540 
game in my opinion as you guys know from
previous<00:03:06.360> videos<00:03:06.870> and<00:03:07.110> then<00:03:07.920> amplify<00:03:08.400> as<00:03:08.460> a
