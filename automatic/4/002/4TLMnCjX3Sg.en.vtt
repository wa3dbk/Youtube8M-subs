 hello everyone is approaching the last night 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:17.090
 of the year and what better to fire her with 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.090
 a good makeup I hope you like it 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.900
 we started preparing the skin applying 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:29.390
 perfect with your fingers so we will get a 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.390
 more velvety and dull result 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.930
 later we will apply corrector 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:43.410
 beige with the fan brush in all 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:48.380
 the mobile eyelid and if together 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.380
 from the tear to the middle of the eye 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.830
 we apply micro fundation with a 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:08.770
 makeup sponge 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.770
 we start with nose front 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.369
 and cheekbones always up 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.460
 we end in the neck always towards 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.460
 down 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.330
 with a cat tongue brush we will apply 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.950
 shadow on the face we start with the 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.950
 Tear with gold color 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:38.570
 then deposit bronze shadow 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.570
 right in the middle of the mobile eyelid 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.470
 and we finish at the ends of the eye 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.470
 with tile color 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.549

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.770
 with black pencil we will mark inside the 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.160
 eye to give more intensity to the 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.160
 look 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.290
 i 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.690
 we will use cream line air which is a 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.600
 intense color product to get 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.090
 a perfect delineation and it is also 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.400
 waterproof 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.560
 edge we will make the bottom line and 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.680

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.680
 length 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.650
 at the end of the eye we will mark a 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:46.200
 triangle giving drama to the 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.200
 makeup blurring the ends 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:58.310
 as a final touch we will apply glitter 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.310
 transparent on the mobile eyelid 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.069
 we will put false eyelashes 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.709
 on which we will apply mask 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.709
 tabs 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:26.060
 with bronze shadow we will apply blush 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.060
 marking the contours of the cheekbone 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:37.240
 you choose if you want you can outline the 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.940
 lip and put a lipstick in shades 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:44.640

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:56.370
 the night do not forget to apply spray 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:59.370
 fixer you are already seeing the result a 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.439
