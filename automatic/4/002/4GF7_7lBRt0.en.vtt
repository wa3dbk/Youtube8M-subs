00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
that the quality if often depends on

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:01.990 
that the quality if often depends on
your<00:03:59.300> performance<00:04:00.110> on<00:04:00.560> your<00:04:01.430> computer

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:41.399 
not all the time I mean if you're a avid

00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:44.119 
not all the time I mean if you're a avid
YouTube<00:05:41.879> habit<00:05:42.779> youtuber<00:05:43.439> and<00:05:43.469> like<00:05:43.949> to

00:05:44.119 --> 00:05:44.129 
YouTube habit youtuber and like to

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:46.610 
YouTube habit youtuber and like to
upload<00:05:44.399> a<00:05:44.819> lot<00:05:45.449> of<00:05:45.659> video<00:05:46.080> game<00:05:46.319> play<00:05:46.589> footage

upload a lot of video game play footage

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.929 
upload a lot of video game play footage
then<00:05:47.249> the<00:05:47.399> hauppage<00:05:48.169> a<00:05:49.580> capture<00:05:50.580> card<00:05:50.610> is

00:05:50.929 --> 00:05:50.939 
then the hauppage a capture card is

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:52.399 
then the hauppage a capture card is
definitely<00:05:51.330> for<00:05:51.569> you<00:05:51.629> because<00:05:52.050> the<00:05:52.229> quality

00:05:52.399 --> 00:05:52.409 
definitely for you because the quality

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:55.760 
definitely for you because the quality
is<00:05:52.649> much<00:05:52.979> better<00:05:53.309> since<00:05:53.999> it<00:05:54.180> uses<00:05:54.770> component

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:55.770 
is much better since it uses component

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:59.299 
is much better since it uses component
cables<00:05:56.159> instead<00:05:56.550> of<00:05:56.669> composite<00:05:57.330> so<00:05:58.099> this<00:05:59.099> is

00:05:59.299 --> 00:05:59.309 
cables instead of composite so this is

00:05:59.309 --> 00:06:02.360 
cables instead of composite so this is
an<00:05:59.550> okay<00:05:59.969> capture<00:06:00.539> card<00:06:00.809> for<00:06:01.139> the<00:06:01.349> average<00:06:01.529> you
