mercedes-benz<00:00:14.839> the<00:00:15.839> answer<00:00:16.230> is<00:00:16.440> none<00:00:16.710> the

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
mercedes-benz the answer is none the

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.120 
mercedes-benz the answer is none the
wood<00:00:17.460> chuck<00:00:17.730> would<00:00:17.910> keep<00:00:18.119> all<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.480> plywood

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.130 
wood chuck would keep all the plywood

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.220 
wood chuck would keep all the plywood
the<00:00:20.130> reason<00:00:20.520> being<00:00:20.760> is<00:00:21.029> this<00:00:21.240> is<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.630> ideal

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
the reason being is this is the ideal

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.099 
the reason being is this is the ideal
thing<00:00:22.529> to<00:00:22.590> use<00:00:22.980> when<00:00:23.840> jacking<00:00:24.840> up<00:00:24.960> a

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
thing to use when jacking up a

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.679 
thing to use when jacking up a
mercedes-benz<00:00:25.619> for<00:00:26.609> both<00:00:26.760> safety<00:00:27.210> and

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
mercedes-benz for both safety and

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.790 
mercedes-benz for both safety and
prevent<00:00:28.019> damage<00:00:28.260> I<00:00:28.740> use<00:00:29.670> either<00:00:30.449> 1<00:00:30.960> inch<00:00:31.170> or

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
prevent damage I use either 1 inch or

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.940 
prevent damage I use either 1 inch or
3/4<00:00:32.460> inch<00:00:32.610> plywood<00:00:32.910> cut<00:00:33.840> in<00:00:34.050> squares<00:00:34.590> of

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
either 5 or 6 inches I can use these in

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.310 
either 5 or 6 inches I can use these in
multiple<00:00:38.309> stacks<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:39.570> get<00:00:39.719> just<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.050> height

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
multiple stacks to get just the height

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
they want the reason I use plywood is

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.889 
they want the reason I use plywood is
number<00:00:44.280> one<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:44.820> won't<00:00:44.969> split<00:00:45.390> like<00:00:45.690> other

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
number one it won't split like other

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.130 
number one it won't split like other
wood<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.440> number<00:00:47.190> two<00:00:47.430> it<00:00:47.820> has<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.480> softness

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
wood and number two it has a softness

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.700 
wood and number two it has a softness
enough<00:00:50.010> surface<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:51.270> be<00:00:51.390> able<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.690> compress<00:00:52.170> to

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
enough surface to be able to compress to

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.549 
enough surface to be able to compress to
prevent<00:00:53.010> damage<00:00:53.430> to<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.670> body<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.149> car

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
prevent damage to the body of the car

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:56.750 
prevent damage to the body of the car
I'm<00:00:55.559> going<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.800> go<00:00:55.860> ahead<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.160> raise<00:00:56.250> this<00:00:56.460> car

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
I'm going to go ahead and raise this car

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.970 
I'm going to go ahead and raise this car
up<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:56.940> little<00:00:57.149> bit<00:00:57.270> so<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:57.539> can<00:00:57.629> see<00:00:58.079> how<00:00:58.649> I<00:00:58.680> use

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
up a little bit so you can see how I use

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:12.830 
up a little bit so you can see how I use
these<00:00:59.550> blocks<00:00:59.879> on<00:01:00.120> a<00:01:00.149> car<00:01:00.420> lift

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.319 

you<00:01:13.799> can<00:01:13.979> see<00:01:14.159> how<00:01:14.340> important<00:01:14.789> it<00:01:14.850> is<00:01:14.969> to<00:01:15.179> use

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:15.329 
you can see how important it is to use

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:17.330 
you can see how important it is to use
plywood<00:01:15.659> there's<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.079> lot<00:01:16.469> of<00:01:16.710> weight<00:01:16.950> on<00:01:16.979> this

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
plywood there's a lot of weight on this

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.279 
plywood there's a lot of weight on this
piece<00:01:17.579> of<00:01:17.729> wood<00:01:17.880> here<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.149> if<00:01:18.390> you<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:19.170> were

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:19.289 
piece of wood here and if you you were

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:22.010 
piece of wood here and if you you were
to<00:01:19.409> use<00:01:19.590> fir<00:01:20.159> or<00:01:20.700> hemlock<00:01:21.000> or<00:01:21.240> any<00:01:21.569> other<00:01:21.840> type

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
to use fir or hemlock or any other type

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.109 
to use fir or hemlock or any other type
of<00:01:22.049> wood<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.979> pressure<00:01:23.280> point<00:01:23.399> would<00:01:23.880> cause

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
of wood that pressure point would cause

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.240 
of wood that pressure point would cause
the<00:01:24.359> wood<00:01:24.539> to<00:01:24.659> split<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.590> car<00:01:25.829> could<00:01:26.039> drop

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
the wood to split and the car could drop

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.550 
the wood to split and the car could drop
onto<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.640> jack<00:01:27.079> the<00:01:28.079> other<00:01:28.200> thing<00:01:28.350> I<00:01:28.409> like

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
onto the jack the other thing I like

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.830 
onto the jack the other thing I like
about<00:01:28.590> wood<00:01:29.130> is<00:01:29.459> it<00:01:29.670> won't<00:01:29.819> slip<00:01:30.179> even<00:01:30.600> if<00:01:30.719> the

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
about wood is it won't slip even if the

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.800 
about wood is it won't slip even if the
car<00:01:31.110> or<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.740> jacket<00:01:32.039> is<00:01:32.340> greasy<00:01:32.810> the

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
car or the jacket is greasy the

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.779 
car or the jacket is greasy the
compression<00:01:34.439> of<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.590> wood<00:01:34.829> will<00:01:35.250> hold<00:01:35.579> that

00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:35.789 
compression of the wood will hold that

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:37.819 
compression of the wood will hold that
safely<00:01:36.270> on<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.630> jack<00:01:36.899> or<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.319> jack<00:01:37.530> point

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829
