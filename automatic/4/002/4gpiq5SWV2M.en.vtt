00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.610
 The kills of the liberators are two 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.229
 games 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.630
 The game is now solving and a hundred 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:31.240
 forty minutes and earned the goal a 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.369
 as the vagina different way already 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.960
 prepared me for this confrontation 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:39.250
 I'm going to watch with Brazil to win the 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:41.560
 game sent tied business win neither 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.020
 because it is two games does not change 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.299
 posture that ajax entered today does not 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.149
 changed what to do inside the field to 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:50.710
 get to win veronia to score and in good 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:52.690
 play ball and forth and do the 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.119
 corinthians but the goalkeeper beto 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.460
 liberators has a regulation 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.700
 different down is defined in 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.869
 two games 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.360
 veronica verone the most important tip 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.259
 provide the neojibÃ¡ win the game do not take 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.019
 goals 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:10.390
 Both things summer is coming to play. 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:12.940
 this is actually a goalless draw 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.380
 is a good hot state out the draw 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.540
 with goal 1 to 1 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.190
 I do not know 2 to 2 she's in ours 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.170
 who does this well can buy 21 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.299
 jackson do what the government comes 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.250
 doing every year since the 

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:26.500
 people set up esteem and leash 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.600
 all there is to the ball and keep the game standard 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.400
 double running is a cool classic 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.400
 always play government game 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.780
 ae 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.130
 because the verona had so much difficulty 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.210
 to create danger plays in the first 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.190
 time 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:29.140
 What happens is the following the game is 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.550
 paying a lot talking too much 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.880
 missing a lot today is losing weight 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.290
 understood the game is hard when the diet 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.080
 their attackers officially appear 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.640
 Tabitha name show up in Game 6 of the 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.080
 google that I was wet 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.940
 I think we're going to come out the same score 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.190
 found in water so far 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.960
 our defense is right our 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.190
 midfield and find nothing is with 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.130
 possession of the ball, but not late in the 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:54.280
 reservation and got back some more 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:58.200
 problem nih the best bad the tie or 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:00.610
 not conceding goals here is the 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.810
 main of all victory 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:04.270
 That's what we have to think about. 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.410
 victory conceded goal is also important 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.380
 do not suffer a goal, right? 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.670
 if that rule the eagle take a shower 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.280
 At home, go two 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.840
 the important thing is to win and a 2 to 0 fish 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.430
 had to try to get you can not 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.620
 lose thank you business 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.269
 good afternoon beginnings who has ever had a 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.720
 posture so defensive in this first 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.000
 time 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.280
 good afternoon the game circumstance 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.930
 playing away from home their team is a 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.910
 good quality technical team 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.430
 I'm going up we're playing. 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.350
 positioned for whom a ball or other 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.450
 We can do the result. 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:35.980
 thiaguinho marcinho is playing a lot 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:36.880
 isolated here only the two no one 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.560
 approaches 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.770
 do not you think that this posture can be 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.600
 very dangerous in the second half 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:46.120
 I believe not because our proposal 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.430
 game is played against attack and 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.180
 also make a steering wheel the 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.460
 quarterbacks 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.650
 even the side can hold there 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.600
 by BB and that marcinho 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.430
 gave him probably playing more 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.930
 stuffed and we were a little pushed back to 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.540
 play in that space and will ensure that 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.220
 acting in the middle is a good proposal for 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.860
 mouth to the lap we will find the space 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.390
 to score a goal or two but is 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.340
 anyone approach if you think it will 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.900
 able to engage the counter attack being 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.680
 that the two are playing regime singles 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.290
 Perfect 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.910
 this issue of the 16- player in the middle 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:17.350
 field and get closer to them 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.210
 It's really something we're accepting. 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:21.430
 already now it's 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.860
 other than that ajax will change to 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.319
 second time 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.340
 said that the the initial posture will 

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:27.750
 change a little 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:31.430
 Let's try to be a bit more aggressive. 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.430
 in the second half the brigadier 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.760
 ae 

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:25.850
 op 

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:30.210
 not out 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:34.430
 ae 

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.870
 annan
