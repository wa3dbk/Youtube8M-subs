I already modded it it originally had an

I already modded it it originally had an
orange<00:00:23.760> bolt<00:00:24.090> here<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.449> pull<00:00:24.750> it<00:00:24.840> back<00:00:25.050> but<00:00:25.380> I'm

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
2000 yet but I have one and I will be

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.049 
2000 yet but I have one and I will be
doing<00:00:32.279> that<00:00:32.399> today<00:00:33.469> so<00:00:34.469> um<00:00:34.800> also<00:00:35.760> I<00:00:35.790> haven't

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
doing that today so um also I haven't

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.110 
doing that today so um also I haven't
replaced<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.660> spring<00:00:36.989> yet<00:00:37.200> but<00:00:37.850> these<00:00:38.850> things

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
replaced the spring yet but these things

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.700 
replaced the spring yet but these things
were<00:00:39.890> intended<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:41.040> fire<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.760> mega<00:00:42.420> darts<00:00:42.809> so

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
were intended to fire the mega darts so

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.720 
were intended to fire the mega darts so
i<00:00:44.809> brassed<00:00:45.809> it<00:00:46.340> so<00:00:47.340> they<00:00:47.520> fired<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.270> micros

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
i brassed it so they fired the micros

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.619 
i brassed it so they fired the micros
when<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:50.760> couldn't<00:00:51.120> find<00:00:51.270> an<00:00:51.449> additional

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
when I couldn't find an additional

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:52.639 
when I couldn't find an additional
spring<00:00:52.140> for<00:00:52.350> it

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
spring for it

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.290 
spring for it
so<00:00:53.570> when<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:54.600> do<00:00:54.719> I'm<00:00:55.590> not<00:00:56.399> gonna<00:00:56.670> just<00:00:56.940> leave<00:00:57.120> it

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
so when I do I'm not gonna just leave it

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.110 
so when I do I'm not gonna just leave it
as<00:00:57.420> this<00:00:57.629> wire<00:00:58.050> as<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.699> plunger<00:00:59.730> I'm<00:00:59.940> actually

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
as this wire as a plunger I'm actually

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.380 
as this wire as a plunger I'm actually
gonna<00:01:00.449> create<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.410> plunger<00:01:01.890> handle<00:01:02.070> for<00:01:02.460> it<00:01:02.579> but

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
gonna create a plunger handle for it but

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.690 
gonna create a plunger handle for it but
I<00:01:03.780> need<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.229> leave<00:01:04.350> it<00:01:04.500> as<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.650> wire<00:01:04.920> from<00:01:05.189> now<00:01:05.369> so

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
I need to leave it as a wire from now so

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.539 
I need to leave it as a wire from now so
the<00:01:05.930> once<00:01:06.930> I<00:01:07.049> find<00:01:07.320> another<00:01:07.590> spring<00:01:08.070> it'll<00:01:08.369> fit

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
the once I find another spring it'll fit

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.539 
the once I find another spring it'll fit
over<00:01:08.790> it<00:01:09.409> so<00:01:10.409> apparently<00:01:10.890> just<00:01:11.189> pull<00:01:11.400> that

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
over it so apparently just pull that

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:12.730 
over it so apparently just pull that
back

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
back

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:19.820 
back
taggart<00:01:13.740> aren't<00:01:13.979> loaded<00:01:18.470> it's<00:01:19.470> pretty<00:01:19.680> nice

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
taggart aren't loaded it's pretty nice

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.120 
taggart aren't loaded it's pretty nice
to<00:01:19.890> get<00:01:20.220> about<00:01:20.659> 50<00:01:21.659> feet<00:01:21.900> flat<00:01:22.490> so<00:01:24.920> 1994<00:01:25.920> this

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
to get about 50 feet flat so 1994 this

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.390 
to get about 50 feet flat so 1994 this
is<00:01:26.250> an<00:01:26.369> extremely<00:01:27.000> rare<00:01:27.450> gun<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.829> yes<00:01:29.100> right

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
is an extremely rare gun and yes right

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.370 
is an extremely rare gun and yes right
now<00:01:29.610> it's<00:01:30.270> not<00:01:30.479> all<00:01:30.659> that<00:01:30.689> impressive<00:01:31.200> but

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
now it's not all that impressive but

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.480 
now it's not all that impressive but
when<00:01:31.829> it<00:01:31.920> has<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.369> 2k<00:01:33.150> integrated<00:01:33.840> in<00:01:34.049> top<00:01:34.490> and

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
when it has the 2k integrated in top and

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.899 
when it has the 2k integrated in top and
it<00:01:35.729> will<00:01:35.820> be<00:01:36.619> pumped<00:01:37.619> by<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.890> original<00:01:38.400> handle

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
it will be pumped by the original handle

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.780 
it will be pumped by the original handle
here<00:01:39.210> I'm<00:01:39.720> gonna<00:01:39.900> be<00:01:40.049> sick<00:01:40.439> so<00:01:41.220> here's<00:01:41.610> one

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
name of this one but also intended to

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.200 
name of this one but also intended to
fire<00:01:49.259> Megas<00:01:49.860> so<00:01:50.579> i<00:01:50.610> brassed<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:52.759> so<00:01:53.759> now<00:01:53.880> fires

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
fire Megas so i brassed it so now fires

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.740 
fire Megas so i brassed it so now fires
micros<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:54.899> at<00:01:55.590> flips<00:01:56.040> positions<00:01:56.670> only<00:01:57.509> fires

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
micros and at flips positions only fires

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.789 
micros and at flips positions only fires
in<00:01:58.170> this<00:01:58.710> position<00:02:00.049> plunger<00:02:01.049> just<00:02:01.229> like<00:02:01.590> the

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
in this position plunger just like the

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:05.959 
in this position plunger just like the
knight<00:02:02.189> finder<00:02:02.579> except<00:02:03.920> really<00:02:04.920> well<00:02:05.790> the

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
knight finder except really well the

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.669 
knight finder except really well the
polos<00:02:06.390> like<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.719> knight<00:02:06.899> finder<00:02:07.290> but<00:02:07.469> then

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
polos like the knight finder but then

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.230 
polos like the knight finder but then
when<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:10.920> trigger<00:02:11.910> is<00:02:12.030> pulled

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
when the trigger is pulled

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.570 
when the trigger is pulled
and<00:02:13.330> this<00:02:13.750> goes<00:02:13.930> in<00:02:14.170> it<00:02:14.350> heats<00:02:14.620> the<00:02:14.830> air<00:02:14.860> up<00:02:15.370> and

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
and this goes in it heats the air up and

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.090 
and this goes in it heats the air up and
through<00:02:15.760> the<00:02:15.880> tube<00:02:16.120> into<00:02:16.540> the<00:02:16.840> dart<00:02:17.110> so<00:02:17.920> what

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
through the tube into the dart so what

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.120 
through the tube into the dart so what
I'm<00:02:18.220> thinking<00:02:18.250> is<00:02:18.850> um<00:02:19.810> I<00:02:20.140> actually<00:02:20.770> haven't

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
I'm thinking is um I actually haven't

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.650 
I'm thinking is um I actually haven't
opened<00:02:21.490> this<00:02:21.580> one<00:02:21.730> up<00:02:21.790> yet<00:02:22.060> like<00:02:22.300> it<00:02:22.420> did<00:02:22.540> the

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
opened this one up yet like it did the

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.140 
opened this one up yet like it did the
evil<00:02:22.900> eye<00:02:23.020> eagle<00:02:23.740> eye<00:02:23.860> but<00:02:24.070> what<00:02:24.220> I<00:02:24.250> do<00:02:24.370> what

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
evil eye eagle eye but what I do what

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.610 
evil eye eagle eye but what I do what
I'm<00:02:25.240> thinking<00:02:25.540> is<00:02:25.630> just<00:02:25.660> cut<00:02:26.140> off<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.410> tube

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620

handle<00:02:29.830> this<00:02:30.820> way<00:02:32.400> but<00:02:33.400> we'll<00:02:34.240> see<00:02:34.420> how<00:02:34.450> that

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
handle this way but we'll see how that

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:37.050

I want to put in a new spring in it so

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.620

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
reason but Stefan actually that was

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.280 
reason but Stefan actually that was
pretty<00:02:59.410> good<00:03:00.360> hold<00:03:01.360> on<00:03:01.420> it<00:03:01.600> takes<00:03:01.840> Tigers

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
pretty good hold on it takes Tigers

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.620

better<00:03:04.800> because<00:03:05.800> it<00:03:05.920> doesn't<00:03:06.250> have<00:03:06.370> the<00:03:06.630> lot

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
better because it doesn't have the lot

better because it doesn't have the lot
of<00:03:07.750> power<00:03:07.930> yet<00:03:08.230> because<00:03:08.560> I<00:03:08.590> haven't<00:03:08.860> replaced

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
of power yet because I haven't replaced

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.720 
of power yet because I haven't replaced
the<00:03:09.460> spring<00:03:10.380> so<00:03:11.380> take<00:03:11.740> stock<00:03:12.160> guards<00:03:12.520> better

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
the spring so take stock guards better

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.270 
the spring so take stock guards better
