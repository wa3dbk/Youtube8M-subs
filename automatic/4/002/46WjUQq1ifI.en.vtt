00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
bad ass Billy Gunn a pretty good match

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.140 
bad ass Billy Gunn a pretty good match
overall<00:00:26.160> I<00:00:26.189> think<00:00:26.340> it<00:00:26.880> could<00:00:26.970> have<00:00:27.090> gone

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
overall I think it could have gone

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.060 
overall I think it could have gone
longer<00:00:27.480> which<00:00:28.260> is<00:00:28.410> kind<00:00:28.560> of<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.680> shame<00:00:28.830> that<00:00:28.859> it

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
longer which is kind of a shame that it

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.410 
longer which is kind of a shame that it
didn't<00:00:29.310> but<00:00:29.699> we<00:00:29.880> are<00:00:30.000> going<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.179> see<00:00:30.300> more

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
didn't but we are going to see more

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.359 
didn't but we are going to see more
matches<00:00:30.779> between<00:00:30.929> these<00:00:31.260> two<00:00:31.470> so<00:00:31.769> why<00:00:32.219> not

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
matches between these two so why not

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.160 
matches between these two so why not
it's<00:00:32.790> a<00:00:32.910> pre-show<00:00:33.239> match<00:00:33.480> it<00:00:33.690> wasn't<00:00:33.960> on<00:00:34.050> the

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
it's a pre-show match it wasn't on the

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.660 
it's a pre-show match it wasn't on the
card<00:00:34.440> so<00:00:34.680> that's<00:00:34.860> another<00:00:35.070> thing<00:00:35.280> where<00:00:35.550> it's

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
card so that's another thing where it's

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.600 
card so that's another thing where it's
a<00:00:35.760> little<00:00:36.030> bit<00:00:36.300> more<00:00:36.420> flexibility<00:00:36.989> but<00:00:37.980> uh<00:00:38.040> I

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
a little bit more flexibility but uh I

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.959 
a little bit more flexibility but uh I
liked<00:00:39.059> it<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.390> I<00:00:40.050> really<00:00:41.040> liked<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.550> outcome

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
liked it and I really liked the outcome

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.060 
liked it and I really liked the outcome
of<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.210> um<00:00:42.570> maybe<00:00:43.230> it's<00:00:43.440> just<00:00:43.469> because<00:00:43.649> I'm

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
of it um maybe it's just because I'm

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.240 
of it um maybe it's just because I'm
from<00:00:44.460> that<00:00:44.670> era<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.739> there's<00:00:46.739> just<00:00:46.920> something

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
from that era and there's just something

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.619 
from that era and there's just something
about<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.640> New<00:00:47.730> Age<00:00:47.760> Outlaws<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.510> I've

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
about the New Age Outlaws that I've

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.110 
about the New Age Outlaws that I've
always<00:00:48.960> liked<00:00:49.559> as<00:00:49.920> like<00:00:50.250> my<00:00:50.460> favorite<00:00:50.820> tag

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
always liked as like my favorite tag

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.029 
always liked as like my favorite tag
team<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.360> all<00:00:51.539> time<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:52.199> then<00:00:52.680> there's<00:00:52.860> that

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
team of all time and then there's that

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.709 
team of all time and then there's that
little<00:00:53.190> nostalgia<00:00:53.730> factor<00:00:53.879> of<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.360> idea<00:00:54.660> that

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
little nostalgia factor of the idea that

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.510 
little nostalgia factor of the idea that
they<00:00:55.050> were<00:00:55.140> breaking<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.500> record<00:00:55.680> of<00:00:56.039> the

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
they were breaking the record of the

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.549 
they were breaking the record of the
longest<00:00:57.030> amount<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.360> time<00:00:57.449> between<00:00:57.809> tag<00:00:58.350> team

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
longest amount of time between tag team

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.529 
longest amount of time between tag team
title<00:00:58.890> reigns<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.280> stuff<00:00:59.520> I<00:00:59.730> think<00:01:00.329> that<00:01:00.359> it's

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
title reigns and stuff I think that it's

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.450 
title reigns and stuff I think that it's
cool<00:01:00.719> i<00:01:01.020> like<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.829> idea<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:02.070> they're<00:01:02.309> the

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
cool i like the idea that they're the

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.950 
cool i like the idea that they're the
tag<00:01:02.640> champs<00:01:02.670> I<00:01:03.180> don't<00:01:03.449> want<00:01:03.570> them<00:01:03.690> to<00:01:03.780> be<00:01:03.870> the

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
of those things where they're going to

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.370 
of those things where they're going to
cold<00:05:01.550> it<00:05:01.669> for<00:05:01.820> a<00:05:01.849> long<00:05:02.060> time<00:05:02.330> I'm<00:05:02.630> not<00:05:02.990> fine

with<00:05:03.410> that<00:05:03.590> because<00:05:03.860> honestly<00:05:04.400> I<00:05:04.639> think<00:05:05.000> it

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.180 
with that because honestly I think it

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.820 
with that because honestly I think it
should<00:05:05.389> go<00:05:05.419> to<00:05:05.599> something<00:05:05.870> like<00:05:06.020> the<00:05:06.259> usos<00:05:06.650> i

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830
