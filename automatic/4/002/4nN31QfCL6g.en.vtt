00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.000
 our dock in a pretty way 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.820
 father and in a very different way 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.560

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.119

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.640
 yura apple and we can also 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.830
 find in the live repo once 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.570
 installed we are not going to adjustments and in 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.029
 adjustments we will be able to find the 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.800
 dock and roll tab here is where 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.990
 we will be able to play with all this for 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:40.610
 example I want to put five icons 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:41.480
 we activate it we can not know to whom doc 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.670
 mod 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.370
 I have so that we turn we are going to give 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.760
 this one of flip and I like how it looks and 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.980
 down here we can have more or less the 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.899
 size of the icons the perspective of 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.420
 the icons scroll how fast 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:59.660
 you want them to turn and other things come out and you can 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.460
 see this is the effect that the flip gives you 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.340
 and we can also put let's 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:09.110
 put it now of three icons and we're going to 

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:10.020
 put you I do not know there is machine sale you can 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.810
 watch 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.329
 is changing you looks pretty father 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.939
 what is the bus that I found that a 

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:19.860
 Sometimes you do not focus correctly on 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.560
 ok icons so that you for example 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.090
 now you can see that from this side 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:27.179
 It has more space than the right side 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.340
 because I do not know how I found it for 

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:32.069
 solve it good very easy nothing more 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.159
 making a start automatically or 

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:37.409
 turning off and turning on the device with 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.209
 that is already one hundred percent but 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.520
 you can see functions in an incredible way 

00:01:39.209 --> 00:01:43.979
 and I recommend it enough to give 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.299
 a different touch to your device in 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.280
