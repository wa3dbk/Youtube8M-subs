00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:43.990 
few quirks that drive me a little bit

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.380 
few quirks that drive me a little bit
crazy<00:00:44.170> such<00:00:44.710> as<00:00:44.860> the<00:00:44.980> combat<00:00:45.520> and<00:00:45.730> the<00:00:46.240> user

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
crazy such as the combat and the user

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.710 
crazy such as the combat and the user
interface<00:00:46.570> generally<00:00:47.470> still<00:00:47.770> is<00:00:48.329> outdated<00:00:49.329> so

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:49.720 
interface generally still is outdated so

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:50.850 
interface generally still is outdated so
I<00:00:49.750> started<00:00:50.079> looking<00:00:50.230> at<00:00:50.500> some<00:00:50.650> other<00:00:50.800> options

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:50.860

could<00:01:50.979> use<00:01:51.040> a<00:01:51.189> little<00:01:51.490> bit<00:01:51.549> of<00:01:51.640> work<00:01:51.820> whereas

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:52.689 
could use a little bit of work whereas

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:54.480 
could use a little bit of work whereas
with<00:01:52.930> more<00:01:53.140> oblivion<00:01:53.590> using<00:01:54.040> the<00:01:54.100> graphic

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
with more oblivion using the graphic

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.850 
with more oblivion using the graphic
engine<00:01:54.640> of<00:01:54.990> oblivion<00:01:56.020> now<00:01:56.500> even<00:01:56.680> though

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
engine of oblivion now even though

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.880 
engine of oblivion now even though
oblivion<00:01:57.340> was<00:01:57.430> built<00:01:57.670> in<00:01:57.790> 2006<00:01:58.689> its<00:01:58.990> graphics

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
oblivion was built in 2006 its graphics

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.090 
oblivion was built in 2006 its graphics
are<00:02:00.070> still<00:02:00.460> very<00:02:00.729> relevant<00:02:00.970> today<00:02:01.390> and

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
are still very relevant today and

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.990 
are still very relevant today and
overall<00:02:03.100> I<00:02:03.130> think<00:02:03.250> the<00:02:03.460> overall<00:02:03.729> experience

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
overall I think the overall experience

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.200 
overall I think the overall experience
of<00:02:04.299> graphics<00:02:04.750> is<00:02:04.930> is<00:02:05.200> much<00:02:05.710> better<00:02:05.979> with<00:02:06.640> more

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
of graphics is is much better with more

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.559 
of graphics is is much better with more
oblivion<00:02:07.750> in<00:02:08.099> terms<00:02:09.099> of<00:02:09.250> combat<00:02:09.789> there's<00:02:10.419> no

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
oblivion in terms of combat there's no

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:14.099 
oblivion in terms of combat there's no
way<00:02:10.689> to<00:02:10.749> sugarcoat<00:02:10.810> it<00:02:11.459> more<00:02:12.459> wins<00:02:12.760> sucks<00:02:13.749> it

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:14.109 
way to sugarcoat it more wins sucks it

00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:15.410 
way to sugarcoat it more wins sucks it
just<00:02:14.739> it's

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
just it's

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.260 
just it's
boring<00:02:15.810> it's<00:02:16.080> it's<00:02:16.650> it's<00:02:16.950> just<00:02:17.250> stupid<00:02:17.760> okay

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
boring it's it's it's just stupid okay

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.960 
boring it's it's it's just stupid okay
so<00:02:18.410> first<00:02:19.410> of<00:02:19.530> all<00:02:19.650> when<00:02:20.130> you<00:02:20.220> start<00:02:20.550> off<00:02:20.670> and

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
so first of all when you start off and

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.699 
so first of all when you start off and
you're<00:02:21.090> living<00:02:21.300> off<00:02:21.480> your<00:02:21.630> character<00:02:21.870> a<00:02:22.319> lot

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
you're living off your character a lot

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.110 
you're living off your character a lot
of<00:02:22.800> times<00:02:22.980> you're<00:02:23.130> swinging<00:02:23.550> and<00:02:23.670> missing<00:02:23.700> so

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
of times you're swinging and missing so

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.640 
of times you're swinging and missing so
you're<00:02:24.270> swinging<00:02:24.660> your<00:02:24.690> sword<00:02:24.810> and<00:02:25.319> you're

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
you're swinging your sword and you're

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:26.930 
you're swinging your sword and you're
not<00:02:25.770> actually<00:02:25.980> connecting<00:02:26.610> with<00:02:26.790> your

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
opponent and when you level up it's just

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.370 
opponent and when you level up it's just
pure<00:02:30.330> button<00:02:30.660> mashing<00:02:30.959> you're<00:02:31.080> just<00:02:31.200> pressing

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
pure button mashing you're just pressing

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.380 
pure button mashing you're just pressing

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
a button after button you know just

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.270 
a button after button you know just

oblivion

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
oblivion

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.059 
oblivion
you<00:02:38.970> got<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.239> Oblivion<00:02:39.660> engine<00:02:40.050> for<00:02:40.560> combat

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
you got the Oblivion engine for combat

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.430 
you got the Oblivion engine for combat
so<00:02:41.370> it<00:02:41.850> gives<00:02:42.150> the<00:02:42.269> illusion<00:02:42.300> of<00:02:42.959> arcane

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
so it gives the illusion of arcane

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.680 
so it gives the illusion of arcane
action<00:02:44.010> combat<00:02:44.280> now<00:02:44.640> it's<00:02:44.849> not<00:02:45.030> kingdoms<00:02:45.510> in<00:02:45.599> a

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
action combat now it's not kingdoms in a

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.900 
action combat now it's not kingdoms in a
Mueller<00:02:46.080> it's<00:02:46.650> not<00:02:46.830> demon<00:02:47.099> soul<00:02:47.430> but<00:02:47.640> it's<00:02:47.760> not

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
Mueller it's not demon soul but it's not

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.790 
Mueller it's not demon soul but it's not
bad<00:02:48.150> for<00:02:48.630> an<00:02:48.720> RPG<00:02:48.989> and<00:02:49.319> you<00:02:49.410> also<00:02:49.560> have<00:02:49.769> a

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
bad for an RPG and you also have a

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.740 
bad for an RPG and you also have a
smarter<00:02:50.250> AI<00:02:50.430> that<00:02:50.880> doesn't<00:02:51.120> get<00:02:51.209> stuck<00:02:51.540> in

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
smarter AI that doesn't get stuck in

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.070 
smarter AI that doesn't get stuck in
certain<00:02:51.930> places<00:02:52.230> so<00:02:53.390> overall<00:02:54.390> I<00:02:54.690> think<00:02:54.750> the

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
certain places so overall I think the

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.130 
certain places so overall I think the
combat<00:02:55.560> and<00:02:55.769> more<00:02:56.130> oblivion<00:02:56.670> is<00:02:57.540> much<00:02:57.930> better

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
combat and more oblivion is much better

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.960 
combat and more oblivion is much better
and<00:02:58.500> makes<00:02:58.769> for<00:02:59.130> a<00:02:59.190> much<00:02:59.370> more<00:02:59.430> interesting

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
and makes for a much more interesting

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.870 
and makes for a much more interesting
experience<00:03:00.620> especially<00:03:01.620> at<00:03:02.160> the<00:03:02.400> early

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
experience especially at the early

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.720 
experience especially at the early
stages<00:03:03.150> and<00:03:03.299> the<00:03:03.540> early<00:03:03.840> levels<00:03:04.049> in<00:03:04.580> terms<00:03:05.580> of

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
stages and the early levels in terms of

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.509 
stages and the early levels in terms of
travel<00:03:06.239> drives<00:03:07.230> me<00:03:07.380> crazy<00:03:07.739> with<00:03:08.069> with<00:03:08.310> more

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
travel drives me crazy with with more

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.610 
travel drives me crazy with with more
wind<00:03:08.790> that<00:03:08.970> you<00:03:09.480> can't<00:03:09.720> fast<00:03:09.989> travel<00:03:10.410> so<00:03:10.530> if

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
wind that you can't fast travel so if

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.199 
wind that you can't fast travel so if
you've<00:03:10.739> been<00:03:10.920> to<00:03:11.040> a<00:03:11.069> location<00:03:11.459> before<00:03:11.940> and

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
you've been to a location before and

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.870 
you've been to a location before and
need<00:03:13.110> to<00:03:13.260> return<00:03:13.560> to<00:03:13.830> it<00:03:13.950> you<00:03:14.580> have<00:03:14.700> to

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
need to return to it you have to

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.910 
need to return to it you have to
basically<00:03:15.060> walk<00:03:15.569> all<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:16.170> way<00:03:16.200> back<00:03:16.470> you<00:03:16.769> know

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
basically walk all the way back you know

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.590 
basically walk all the way back you know
some<00:03:17.190> cases<00:03:17.549> you<00:03:17.670> can<00:03:17.700> use<00:03:17.850> silt<00:03:18.330> Strider

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
some cases you can use silt Strider

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.420 
some cases you can use silt Strider
service<00:03:19.049> or<00:03:19.200> a<00:03:19.230> transport<00:03:19.709> serviceable<00:03:20.160> tool

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
service or a transport serviceable tool

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.849 
service or a transport serviceable tool
transports<00:03:21.359> you<00:03:21.450> to<00:03:21.510> a<00:03:21.660> general<00:03:22.350> area<00:03:22.709> which

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:22.859 
transports you to a general area which

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:24.949 
transports you to a general area which
is<00:03:23.040> closer<00:03:23.400> but<00:03:24.120> you<00:03:24.180> still<00:03:24.390> got<00:03:24.540> to<00:03:24.630> do<00:03:24.720> a<00:03:24.750> lot

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
is closer but you still got to do a lot

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.340 
is closer but you still got to do a lot
of<00:03:25.019> walking<00:03:25.670> also<00:03:26.670> what<00:03:27.480> drives<00:03:27.720> me<00:03:27.900> crazy<00:03:28.200> is

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
of walking also what drives me crazy is

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.259 
of walking also what drives me crazy is
the<00:03:28.470> fact<00:03:28.769> that<00:03:28.890> there's<00:03:29.160> no<00:03:29.280> map<00:03:29.579> marker<00:03:30.060> so

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
the fact that there's no map marker so

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.360 
the fact that there's no map marker so
when<00:03:30.810> you<00:03:30.900> go<00:03:31.019> on<00:03:31.140> a<00:03:31.170> quest<00:03:31.500> in<00:03:31.769> more<00:03:32.100> wind

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
when you go on a quest in more wind

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
when you go on a quest in more wind
you've<00:03:33.209> got<00:03:33.359> to<00:03:33.510> actually<00:03:33.660> pay<00:03:34.440> attention<00:03:35.040> or

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
you've got to actually pay attention or

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.080 
you've got to actually pay attention or
remember<00:03:36.390> or<00:03:36.630> know<00:03:37.560> where<00:03:38.010> to<00:03:38.220> go<00:03:38.400> you<00:03:38.670> got<00:03:39.060> to

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
remember or know where to go you got to

terms of the installation process for
the<00:04:02.310> most<00:04:02.579> part<00:04:02.970> more<00:04:03.900> oblivion<00:04:04.410> wasn't<00:04:04.829> too

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
the most part more oblivion wasn't too

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:05.539

basically<00:04:06.269> if<00:04:06.329> you're<00:04:06.450> familiar<00:04:06.600> with

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
basically if you're familiar with

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.890 
basically if you're familiar with
modding<00:04:07.470> for<00:04:07.680> oblivion<00:04:08.160> it's<00:04:09.120> pretty<00:04:09.569> similar

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
modding for oblivion it's pretty similar

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.559 
modding for oblivion it's pretty similar
I<00:04:10.230> had<00:04:11.160> to<00:04:11.310> adjust<00:04:11.370> the<00:04:11.700> load<00:04:11.880> order<00:04:12.120> which<00:04:12.389> the

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 
I had to adjust the load order which the

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:14.780 
I had to adjust the load order which the
mod<00:04:12.780> was<00:04:12.989> actually<00:04:13.440> at<00:04:13.500> the<00:04:13.560> top<00:04:13.829> of<00:04:14.100> the<00:04:14.400> load

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
mod was actually at the top of the load

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.719 
mod was actually at the top of the load
order<00:04:15.000> sequence<00:04:15.440> and<00:04:16.440> basically<00:04:17.250> that<00:04:17.400> you

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729 
order sequence and basically that you

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:20.240 
order sequence and basically that you
know<00:04:17.760> got<00:04:18.630> it<00:04:18.780> working<00:04:18.959> but<00:04:19.320> there<00:04:19.889> isn't<00:04:20.039> too

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
know got it working but there isn't too

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.979 
know got it working but there isn't too
much<00:04:20.400> to<00:04:21.000> do<00:04:21.120> there<00:04:21.299> it<00:04:21.450> does<00:04:21.600> have<00:04:21.750> a<00:04:21.780> bit<00:04:21.959> of

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
much to do there it does have a bit of

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:23.960 
much to do there it does have a bit of
an<00:04:22.139> installer<00:04:22.500> there<00:04:22.770> and<00:04:22.979> all<00:04:23.370> you<00:04:23.520> need<00:04:23.729> is

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
an installer there and all you need is

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.720 
an installer there and all you need is
the<00:04:24.180> game<00:04:24.330> of<00:04:24.360> the<00:04:24.510> year<00:04:24.659> edition<00:04:24.780> of

the game of the year edition of
and<00:04:25.970> the<00:04:26.360> game<00:04:26.540> of<00:04:26.570> the<00:04:26.720> year<00:04:26.930> edition<00:04:27.080> of

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
and the game of the year edition of

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.820 
and the game of the year edition of
oblivion<00:04:28.310> and<00:04:28.460> the<00:04:28.520> mod<00:04:29.360> pack<00:04:29.600> which<00:04:30.350> will<00:04:30.380> put

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
oblivion and the mod pack which will put

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.500 
oblivion and the mod pack which will put
the<00:04:30.950> two<00:04:31.100> together<00:04:31.280> now<00:04:32.240> the<00:04:32.300> biggest

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:32.510 
the two together now the biggest

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.780 
the two together now the biggest
downfall<00:04:33.140> with<00:04:33.530> more<00:04:33.800> oblivion<00:04:34.250> is<00:04:34.400> that<00:04:34.610> it's

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:34.790 
downfall with more oblivion is that it's

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:36.700 
downfall with more oblivion is that it's
still<00:04:34.970> concerned<00:04:35.330> as<00:04:35.480> beta<00:04:35.690> stages<00:04:35.990> so<00:04:36.380> that

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
still concerned as beta stages so that

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.190 
still concerned as beta stages so that
means<00:04:36.920> there<00:04:37.100> are<00:04:37.250> some<00:04:37.700> bugs<00:04:38.150> but<00:04:38.510> I<00:04:38.960> still

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200 
means there are some bugs but I still

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.590 
means there are some bugs but I still
give<00:04:39.380> it<00:04:39.500> a<00:04:39.650> 7<00:04:40.490> out<00:04:40.580> of<00:04:40.610> 10<00:04:40.730> in<00:04:41.150> terms<00:04:41.360> of<00:04:41.480> its

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:41.600 
give it a 7 out of 10 in terms of its

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.720 
give it a 7 out of 10 in terms of its
playability<00:04:42.080> but<00:04:42.950> when<00:04:43.070> you<00:04:43.160> consider<00:04:43.340> this

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:43.730 
playability but when you consider this

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:45.400 
playability but when you consider this
is<00:04:43.850> something<00:04:44.120> that's<00:04:44.240> been<00:04:44.360> made<00:04:44.570> for<00:04:44.780> free<00:04:45.170> I

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
is something that's been made for free I

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.320 
is something that's been made for free I
give<00:04:46.040> it<00:04:46.160> a<00:04:46.190> 9<00:04:46.400> out<00:04:46.610> of<00:04:46.640> 10<00:04:46.910> and<00:04:47.120> it's

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
give it a 9 out of 10 and it's

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.930 
give it a 9 out of 10 and it's
production<00:04:47.870> values<00:04:48.320> so<00:04:48.920> if<00:04:49.310> you're<00:04:49.850> looking

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
production values so if you're looking

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.580 
production values so if you're looking
for<00:04:50.360> something<00:04:50.840> that's<00:04:51.050> a<00:04:51.110> little<00:04:51.170> bit<00:04:51.350> more

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
for something that's a little bit more

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.670 
for something that's a little bit more
stable<00:04:52.040> I<00:04:52.760> would<00:04:53.420> go<00:04:53.570> with<00:04:53.720> the<00:04:53.870> overall<00:04:54.230> pack

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
stable I would go with the overall pack

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.580 
stable I would go with the overall pack
but<00:04:55.490> overall<00:04:56.180> more<00:04:56.570> oblivion<00:04:57.080> still<00:04:57.350> has

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
but overall more oblivion still has

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.950 
but overall more oblivion still has
great<00:04:58.580> majority<00:04:59.000> of<00:04:59.150> the<00:04:59.240> quests<00:04:59.570> are<00:04:59.720> still

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
great majority of the quests are still

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.780 
great majority of the quests are still
playable<00:05:00.320> the<00:05:00.800> main<00:05:00.980> quest<00:05:01.280> is<00:05:01.550> still

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:01.790 
playable the main quest is still

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:04.030 
playable the main quest is still
playable<00:05:02.150> so<00:05:02.690> I<00:05:02.720> think<00:05:02.930> it's<00:05:03.230> still<00:05:03.890> a<00:05:03.920> good

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:04.040 
playable so I think it's still a good

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.380 
playable so I think it's still a good
option<00:05:04.250> if<00:05:04.490> you're<00:05:04.610> playing<00:05:04.820> both<00:05:05.120> games

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:05.390 
option if you're playing both games

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:07.450

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
following different paths because again

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.610 
following different paths because again
more<00:05:07.730> when<00:05:07.910> does<00:05:08.060> that<00:05:08.090> that'd<00:05:08.690> be<00:05:08.840> a<00:05:08.870> game<00:05:09.140> at

more when does that that'd be a game at

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.100 
more when does that that'd be a game at
the<00:05:09.950> very<00:05:10.160> least<00:05:10.460> you<00:05:11.390> can<00:05:11.540> consider<00:05:11.840> the<00:05:11.960> more
