00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
throw in every now and then an F and go

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.589 
throw in every now and then an F and go
back<00:00:14.130> to<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.490> d<00:00:14.639> to<00:00:15.089> make<00:00:15.269> sure<00:00:15.420> you're

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
playing all the notes around the

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.120 
playing all the notes around the
transition<00:00:17.940> so<00:00:18.090> you<00:00:18.150> always<00:00:18.480> are<00:00:18.930> able<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:19.560> get
