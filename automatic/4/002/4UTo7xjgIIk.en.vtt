actually<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.439> redstone<00:01:34.680> torch<00:01:34.860> by<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.250> way<00:01:35.369> all

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
actually a redstone torch by the way all

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.920 
actually a redstone torch by the way all
this<00:01:35.640> stuff<00:01:35.820> is<00:01:35.970> completely<00:01:36.090> craftable<00:01:36.689> and

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
this stuff is completely craftable and

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.109 
this stuff is completely craftable and
survival<00:01:37.350> yes<00:01:37.560> oh<00:01:37.680> no<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.430> crafting<00:01:38.790> recipes

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
survival yes oh no and crafting recipes

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.280 
survival yes oh no and crafting recipes
have<00:01:39.329> been<00:01:39.360> created<00:01:39.869> so<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.020> guys<00:01:40.170> can

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
have been created so you guys can

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.780 
have been created so you guys can
totally<00:01:40.590> go<00:01:40.680> players<00:01:40.890> add<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.400> redstone<00:01:41.700> torch

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
totally go players add a redstone torch

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.240 
totally go players add a redstone torch
and<00:01:42.210> it<00:01:42.360> just<00:01:42.540> powers<00:01:42.840> up<00:01:42.960> on<00:01:43.170> any<00:01:43.710> type<00:01:44.220> of

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
and it just powers up on any type of

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.399 
and it just powers up on any type of
redstone<00:01:44.729> lying<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.630> just<00:01:45.689> really<00:01:46.229> awesome

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
redstone lying and just really awesome

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.499 
redstone lying and just really awesome
this<00:01:46.829> one<00:01:46.979> is<00:01:47.159> a<00:01:47.189> daylight<00:01:47.700> sensor<00:01:47.939> whenever

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
this one is a daylight sensor whenever

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.850 
this one is a daylight sensor whenever
there<00:01:48.899> is<00:01:48.990> light<00:01:49.229> around<00:01:49.530> it<00:01:49.710> basically

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
there is light around it basically

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.289 
there is light around it basically
powers<00:01:50.310> up<00:01:50.490> whatever<00:01:50.729> it's<00:01:50.909> connected<00:01:51.270> to

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
powers up whatever it's connected to

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.630 
powers up whatever it's connected to
these<00:01:52.020> are<00:01:52.170> buttons<00:01:52.439> um<00:01:52.799> they<00:01:53.310> can<00:01:53.399> only<00:01:53.549> be

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
these are buttons um they can only be

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.880 
these are buttons um they can only be
placed<00:01:54.030> on<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.509> on<00:01:54.689> top<00:01:55.140> of<00:01:55.320> blocks<00:01:55.619> for

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
placed on the on top of blocks for

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.260 
placed on the on top of blocks for
whatever<00:01:56.070> reason<00:01:56.460> but<00:01:56.610> they<00:01:56.729> do<00:01:56.909> seem<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.149> be

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
whatever reason but they do seem to be

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.969 
whatever reason but they do seem to be
working<00:01:57.869> perfectly<00:01:58.140> so<00:01:58.649> that's<00:01:58.799> really

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
working perfectly so that's really

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.030 
working perfectly so that's really
awesome<00:01:59.399> right<00:01:59.670> there<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:00.380> this<00:02:01.380> is<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.710> lever

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
awesome right there and this is a lever

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.679 
awesome right there and this is a lever
what<00:02:02.490> it<00:02:02.640> basically<00:02:02.729> does<00:02:03.119> is<00:02:03.329> you<00:02:03.450> hit<00:02:03.570> it

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
what it basically does is you hit it

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.480 
what it basically does is you hit it
once<00:02:03.869> it<00:02:04.229> turns<00:02:04.469> on<00:02:04.649> you're<00:02:04.860> hitting<00:02:05.070> once<00:02:05.219> it

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
once it turns on you're hitting once it

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.609 
once it turns on you're hitting once it
turns<00:02:05.790> off<00:02:06.000> so<00:02:06.540> pretty<00:02:06.810> simple<00:02:07.020> stuff<00:02:07.439> in

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
turns off so pretty simple stuff in

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.529 
turns off so pretty simple stuff in
terms<00:02:07.770> of<00:02:08.039> that<00:02:08.190> now<00:02:08.759> all<00:02:09.030> I'm<00:02:09.270> just<00:02:09.300> going<00:02:09.420> to

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
terms of that now all I'm just going to

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.210 
terms of that now all I'm just going to
show<00:02:09.629> you<00:02:09.660> guys<00:02:09.869> that<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.410> did<00:02:10.709> add<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:11.039> iron

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
show you guys that the did add the iron

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.490 
show you guys that the did add the iron
door<00:02:11.459> into<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:11.970> crappy<00:02:12.300> inventory<00:02:12.690> and

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
door into the crappy inventory and

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.560 
door into the crappy inventory and
as<00:02:13.590> you<00:02:13.770> guys<00:02:13.890> can<00:02:13.980> see<00:02:14.040> I<00:02:14.490> just<00:02:15.030> step<00:02:15.210> on<00:02:15.390> that

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
as you guys can see I just step on that

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.870 
as you guys can see I just step on that
and<00:02:15.900> it<00:02:16.020> opens<00:02:16.050> up<00:02:16.530> and<00:02:17.100> it<00:02:17.220> does<00:02:17.370> work<00:02:17.610> on<00:02:17.820> the

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
and it opens up and it does work on the

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.430 
and it opens up and it does work on the
wooden<00:02:18.420> doors<00:02:18.570> as<00:02:18.720> well<00:02:18.750> as<00:02:18.930> trap<00:02:19.170> doors<00:02:19.350> as

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
wooden doors as well as trap doors as

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.950 
wooden doors as well as trap doors as
well<00:02:19.470> so<00:02:20.400> really<00:02:20.430> really<00:02:21.060> simple<00:02:21.420> stuff<00:02:21.690> now

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
well so really really simple stuff now

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.110 
well so really really simple stuff now
over<00:02:22.260> here<00:02:22.590> this<00:02:23.070> should<00:02:23.280> be<00:02:23.490> a<00:02:23.520> normal<00:02:23.940> piston

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
over here this should be a normal piston

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.450 
over here this should be a normal piston
and<00:02:24.420> a<00:02:24.540> slime<00:02:24.780> block<00:02:24.960> um<00:02:25.230> so<00:02:25.650> far<00:02:25.890> I<00:02:25.950> don't<00:02:26.340> know

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
and a slime block um so far I don't know

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:27.970 
and a slime block um so far I don't know
what<00:02:26.580> these<00:02:26.640> slime<00:02:26.880> blocks<00:02:27.180> actually<00:02:27.450> do

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
what these slime blocks actually do

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.260 
what these slime blocks actually do
besides<00:02:28.980> I<00:02:29.370> don't<00:02:29.430> know<00:02:29.580> it<00:02:29.640> seemed<00:02:29.970> to<00:02:30.090> be

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
besides I don't know it seemed to be

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:31.550 
besides I don't know it seemed to be
able<00:02:30.360> to<00:02:30.510> admit<00:02:30.750> life<00:02:30.930> but<00:02:31.170> it<00:02:31.260> doesn't<00:02:31.350> feel

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
able to admit life but it doesn't feel

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.780 
able to admit life but it doesn't feel
like<00:02:31.650> I<00:02:31.740> can<00:02:31.890> pounce<00:02:32.100> on<00:02:32.280> them<00:02:32.490> for<00:02:32.640> whatever

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
like I can pounce on them for whatever

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.730 
like I can pounce on them for whatever
reason<00:02:33.240> but<00:02:33.810> um<00:02:33.959> if<00:02:34.260> you<00:02:34.410> guys<00:02:34.470> don't<00:02:34.680> know

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
reason but um if you guys don't know

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.560 
reason but um if you guys don't know
what<00:02:34.830> pistons<00:02:35.160> do<00:02:35.310> this<00:02:35.820> is<00:02:35.940> a<00:02:35.970> normal<00:02:36.390> piston

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
what pistons do this is a normal piston

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.330 
what pistons do this is a normal piston
it<00:02:36.780> just<00:02:36.900> extends<00:02:37.290> upwards<00:02:37.770> or<00:02:37.920> sideways

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
it just extends upwards or sideways

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.949 
it just extends upwards or sideways
really<00:02:38.640> cool<00:02:38.820> for<00:02:39.030> building<00:02:39.300> cool<00:02:39.450> stuff<00:02:39.690> I'm

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
really cool for building cool stuff I'm

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.990 
really cool for building cool stuff I'm
just<00:02:40.350> a<00:02:40.650> normal<00:02:40.980> piston<00:02:41.160> as<00:02:41.370> you<00:02:41.459> can<00:02:41.730> see<00:02:41.850> it

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
just a normal piston as you can see it

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.760 
just a normal piston as you can see it
does<00:02:42.180> come<00:02:42.420> back<00:02:42.450> down<00:02:42.780> but<00:02:43.290> this<00:02:43.500> is<00:02:43.560> the

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
does come back down but this is the

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.650 
does come back down but this is the
sticky<00:02:44.160> piston<00:02:44.459> with<00:02:44.730> judge<00:02:44.880> it<00:02:45.030> does<00:02:45.390> the

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
sticky piston with judge it does the

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.810 
sticky piston with judge it does the
exact<00:02:45.989> same<00:02:46.020> thing<00:02:46.260> but<00:02:46.980> it<00:02:47.340> actually<00:02:47.489> um

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
exact same thing but it actually um

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.190 
exact same thing but it actually um
brings<00:02:48.090> the<00:02:48.239> block<00:02:48.450> with<00:02:48.630> it<00:02:48.660> but<00:02:48.930> it<00:02:49.020> does

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
brings the block with it but it does

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.110 
brings the block with it but it does
stick<00:02:49.470> to<00:02:49.620> it<00:02:49.770> and<00:02:49.950> you<00:02:50.100> can<00:02:50.310> you<00:02:50.400> know<00:02:50.520> use<00:02:51.000> it

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
stick to it and you can you know use it

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.940 
stick to it and you can you know use it
for<00:02:51.300> a<00:02:51.330> really<00:02:51.540> multiple<00:02:51.989> a<00:02:52.170> lot<00:02:52.620> of<00:02:52.739> stuff

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
for a really multiple a lot of stuff

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.310 
for a really multiple a lot of stuff
actually<00:02:53.280> bit<00:02:53.430> I<00:02:53.550> suck<00:02:54.180> with<00:02:54.209> redstone<00:02:54.570> now

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
actually bit I suck with redstone now

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.420 
actually bit I suck with redstone now
these<00:02:55.470> are<00:02:55.590> other<00:02:55.739> stuff<00:02:56.010> that<00:02:56.040> have<00:02:56.220> been

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
these are other stuff that have been
