00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:32.329 
blow it out or wear it down too much so

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:36.750 
blow it out or wear it down too much so
before<00:02:33.320> I<00:02:33.410> do<00:02:33.470> right<00:02:33.739> brakes<00:02:34.040> but<00:02:34.250> still<00:02:34.780> um

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
before I do right brakes but still um

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.460 
before I do right brakes but still um
any<00:02:37.760> cons<00:02:38.180> about<00:02:38.420> it<00:02:39.130> I<00:02:41.079> don't<00:02:42.079> think<00:02:42.200> so<00:02:42.440> I

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
any cons about it I don't think so I

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:43.930 
any cons about it I don't think so I
mean<00:02:42.709> as<00:02:43.010> long<00:02:43.160> as<00:02:43.220> you're<00:02:43.549> smooth<00:02:43.760> enough

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
mean as long as you're smooth enough

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:44.559 
mean as long as you're smooth enough
with<00:02:44.150> tires

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
with tires

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:46.230 
with tires
if<00:02:44.930> you<00:02:45.290> don't<00:02:45.440> do<00:02:45.560> tons

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
if you don't do tons

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.990 
if you don't do tons
and<00:02:46.450> I<00:02:46.630> guess<00:02:46.840> it's<00:02:47.170> the<00:02:47.520> sidewalls<00:02:48.520> fairly

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
and I guess it's the sidewalls fairly

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.230 
and I guess it's the sidewalls fairly
thin<00:02:49.380> as<00:02:50.380> you<00:02:50.560> see<00:02:50.860> the<00:02:51.160> south<00:02:51.430> end<00:02:51.700> it<00:02:51.820> is<00:02:51.940> like

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
thin as you see the south end it is like

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.110 
thin as you see the south end it is like
you<00:02:52.390> can<00:02:53.040> see<00:02:54.040> my<00:02:54.160> finger<00:02:54.430> pressing<00:02:54.910> through

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
you can see my finger pressing through

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.750 
you can see my finger pressing through
it<00:02:55.270> fairly<00:02:55.510> easily<00:02:55.840> so<00:02:56.380> yeah<00:02:57.370> it's<00:02:57.520> pretty

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
it fairly easily so yeah it's pretty

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.310 
it fairly easily so yeah it's pretty
thin<00:02:57.940> tyre<00:02:58.150> although<00:02:58.630> I'm<00:02:58.720> just<00:02:58.870> folding<00:02:59.080> it

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
thin tyre although I'm just folding it

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.630 
thin tyre although I'm just folding it
over<00:02:59.470> that's<00:02:59.740> generally<00:03:00.100> or<00:03:00.190> making<00:03:00.400> a<00:03:00.430> thin

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
over that's generally or making a thin

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.490 
over that's generally or making a thin
but<00:03:01.000> whatever

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
but whatever

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.390

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
much to say it it's a tire it's pretty

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.270 
much to say it it's a tire it's pretty
spendy<00:03:19.630> tired<00:03:19.960> but<00:03:20.260> it's<00:03:20.410> well<00:03:20.710> worth<00:03:20.920> it<00:03:21.100> it's

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
spendy tired but it's well worth it it's

spendy tired but it's well worth it it's
feel<00:03:21.430> solid<00:03:21.880> around<00:03:22.210> it's<00:03:23.170> fast<00:03:23.470> holds

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
feel solid around it's fast holds

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.280 
feel solid around it's fast holds
pressure<00:03:24.490> good<00:03:24.880> well<00:03:25.270> more<00:03:25.600> of<00:03:25.630> a<00:03:25.720> 2d<00:03:26.050> job

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
pressure good well more of a 2d job

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.880 
pressure good well more of a 2d job
again<00:03:26.590> but<00:03:26.980> still<00:03:27.510> at<00:03:28.510> least<00:03:28.630> good<00:03:28.900> good<00:03:29.590> sides

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
again but still at least good good sides

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.960 
again but still at least good good sides
it's<00:03:30.130> a<00:03:30.190> 156<00:03:31.060> millimeter<00:03:31.480> deflated<00:03:31.960> so<00:03:32.970> pretty

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
it's a 156 millimeter deflated so pretty

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.090 
it's a 156 millimeter deflated so pretty
decent<00:03:34.300> size<00:03:34.450> for<00:03:34.900> a<00:03:35.400> more<00:03:36.840> race<00:03:38.100> involved

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
decent size for a more race involved

decent size for a more race involved
tire<00:03:40.590> but<00:03:41.590> yeah<00:03:41.710> that<00:03:42.040> pretty<00:03:42.250> much<00:03:42.340> sums<00:03:42.640> up<00:03:42.790> a

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
tire but yeah that pretty much sums up a

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.710 
tire but yeah that pretty much sums up a
review<00:03:43.210> not<00:03:43.660> much<00:03:43.870> to<00:03:44.020> say<00:03:44.230> it's<00:03:44.440> get<00:03:44.710> tire<00:03:44.950> and

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720
