00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.120
 Hello 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.879
 in class today we will learn a 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.650
 little more about machines 5 than anything 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:16.779
 more than an instrument that serves 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.359
 to facilitate the achievement was 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:23.500
 day-to-day work as with this art 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:26.500
 to shake and raise it occurs 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:29.170
 through the expansion or transmission of 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:32.770
 strength ascertained by the 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:35.350
 combination of several machines is what 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.540
 generates a complex machine and the types of 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.870
 simple machines that exist and we 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:43.629
 can attack are the lever the pulley that 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:48.840
 It is also called foliage gear 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:50.890
 that the wheel sprocket and also the plane 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.770
 inclined 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.129
 so let's go see and know a little 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.129
 more 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:04.879
 the lever is formed by an object 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:07.610
 that is capable of rotating around a 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:11.560
 fixed point of force applied 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:14.750
 by the so-called powerful force is 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:17.810
 multiplied and applied by the lever 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:22.720
 other side of the point of support, this being 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:27.229
 resistant force there are three types of 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:29.270
 levers inter fixed lever where the 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:33.200
 point of support is between the 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:37.430
 powerful and resistant as per 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:43.180
 example the balances seesaws there caxias 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:46.759
 goat's foot and shears inter lever 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:49.460
 where the resistive force is 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:53.000
 between the point of support and the 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:55.580
 powerful force such as cart 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.930
 of a bottle opener and break 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:03.560
 new and we also have inter 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.890
 potent force is located 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.400
 between the point of support and the 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.970
 resistant 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:15.070
 some examples are broom forceps 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.070
 junior cutter and etc. 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.860
 pulley or foliage rotating a piece 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.920
 mechanics very common in several 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:31.030
 machines used to transfer force 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:33.820
 The movement of the pulleys is 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.460
 where a film or string is passed that 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.660
 It is to transmit the force applied for was 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.170
 resistant 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:43.900
 there are two types of pulley system o 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:47.500
 system which contains fixed clothing and the 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:49.930
 system that contained immovable pulleys in 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:53.080
 a system that contains round in the fixed 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.660
 the existing pit that is the one to which the 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.709
 machine will be the same as it was 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.830
 applied 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:02.920
 that is, the force with tends to 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:06.670
 difference will be the direction of force 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:09.820
 movable leaf system to powerful force 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:14.260
 will be divided according to a number of 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:16.750
 that the system contains an example in 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.930
 a system with two policemen will have the 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:23.290
 strong force divided in two as 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.180
 half of the resistive force is exerted 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.430
 the area where the police are 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.470
 prey 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:32.680
 we can observe several systems 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:35.709
 available in our daily lives 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.470
 for example on clotheslines in the 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:41.200
 weight machines in the engine 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:44.610
 cars on cranes and on 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.610
 transport of materials 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:53.510
 gears gears are machines 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.970
 simple aimed at reducing the for 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.890
 increase of a particular device or 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.530
 to change its direction 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:03.770
 thus a gear is a set 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:06.800
 toothed wheels that engage 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:09.620
 somehow the most 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:11.810
 for the use of the gears is 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.930
 which is not always a device 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:16.970
 machine for example has its speed 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.709
 suitable for operation equal to that 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:22.460
 device that placed it in the 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:24.680
 move an engine for example let's say 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.940
 that the engine driven by a set 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.720
 of issues 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:33.200
 place a crankshaft to work 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:35.570
 with a rotation speed of one thousand rpm 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:40.640
 but the machine he intends to use only 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:43.970
 works well if you use 250 rpm ratio 4 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:45.500
 to reduce the angular velocity by a 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:48.860
 factor 4 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:51.890
 simply couple the gears of 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:54.830
 way while one of the four 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:57.710
 You go back to one of only one lap 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:00.770
 this is achieved by making one of the 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.900
 wheel has four times more teeth than 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.970
 that the other 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:07.310
 we usually build a system of 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:11.680
 two gears forming a set 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:15.110
 only if it can transmit the energy 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.220
 proportionally promoted by an engine to 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:19.900
 a machine 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:22.730
 sometimes however it is not convenient 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:26.090
 use the gears connected to each other 

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:29.560
 directly in these cases can do the 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.560
 use of chains 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:42.500
 good planting is one of the simple machines 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:44.210
 the world's oldest 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.370
 after Egyptians used a 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:49.460
 technique to load the blocks in the 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:51.440
 construction of the Egyptian pyramids or 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.960
 that he also used the 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.370
 because they climbed mountains in 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.110
 food search 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:02.540
 This was already using a machine 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:04.340
 simple that is the good inclined plane is 

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:05.810
 nowadays you are the best example of 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:08.720
 inclined planes 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:11.510
 the ramps or even those faults 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:15.110
 screws that will make the job easier 

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:17.090
 of man because the inclined plane is 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:20.690
 its main objective is to facilitate the 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:22.790
 work and the man use half less 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:27.320
 were possible 

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:29.510
 good is for example I do not even know where it is 

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:31.550
 a great sign that there is between 0 8 

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:34.250
 degrees horizontally 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:36.410
 for example who pick up a box of 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:38.810
 a place until the other day I discovered the 

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:41.480
 work that will be used in this period 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:45.590
 needing to do work equal to sweat 

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:48.410
 turn the shift if a ramp it 

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:51.590
 how much even less is u 

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:52.700
 her degree is easier for people 

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:55.850
 to charge 

00:06:52.700 --> 00:07:00.260
 however the distance will be greater 

00:06:55.850 --> 00:07:02.030
 well then we can see that a plan 

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:05.200
 inclined and facilitates many activities 

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:05.200
 our day to day
