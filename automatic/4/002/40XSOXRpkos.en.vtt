I'm gonna show you two different ways
you<00:00:38.160> can<00:00:38.280> do<00:00:38.399> this<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.790> first<00:00:39.000> way<00:00:39.149> is<00:00:39.450> using

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
you can do this the first way is using

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.440 
you can do this the first way is using
an<00:00:39.899> old<00:00:40.170> candle<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.879> candles<00:00:42.210> already

an old candle and the candles already
burn<00:00:42.629> out<00:00:42.780> so<00:00:42.809> if<00:00:43.320> you<00:00:43.440> have<00:00:43.590> leftover<00:00:44.129> wax<00:00:44.340> you

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
the whole entire surface area of this

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.389 
the whole entire surface area of this
since<00:01:43.020> this<00:01:43.140> is<00:01:43.320> a<00:01:43.350> candle<00:01:43.799> holder<00:01:44.100> it's<00:01:44.280> a

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
since this is a candle holder it's a

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.940 
since this is a candle holder it's a
little<00:01:44.640> bit<00:01:44.790> harder<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.180> hold<00:01:45.600> it<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.020> even<00:01:46.860> if

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
little bit harder to hold it and even if

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.380 
little bit harder to hold it and even if
you<00:01:47.040> were<00:01:47.130> doing<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.430> jar<00:01:47.640> you<00:01:47.820> do<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.149> same

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
you were doing a jar you do it the same

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.630 
you were doing a jar you do it the same
exact<00:01:48.750> way<00:01:48.899> you<00:01:48.960> want<00:01:49.229> to<00:01:49.320> get<00:01:49.470> every<00:01:50.159> inch<00:01:50.189> of

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
exact way you want to get every inch of

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.149 
exact way you want to get every inch of
this<00:01:50.880> especially<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.810> edges<00:01:52.259> I<00:01:52.500> can't<00:01:52.979> tell

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
this especially the edges I can't tell

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.440 
this especially the edges I can't tell
you<00:01:53.220> how<00:01:53.340> many<00:01:53.399> times<00:01:53.700> I<00:01:53.850> mess<00:01:54.060> up<00:01:54.210> when<00:01:54.390> I

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
you how many times I mess up when I

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.359 
you how many times I mess up when I
didn't<00:01:54.780> get<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:54.960> edges<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.619> then<00:01:56.280> the

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
didn't get the edges and then the

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:57.649 
didn't get the edges and then the
glitter<00:01:56.579> would<00:01:56.729> fall<00:01:56.909> off<00:01:56.939> so<00:01:57.240> you<00:01:57.390> really

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
glitter would fall off so you really

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:58.700 
glitter would fall off so you really
want<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:57.869> make<00:01:57.990> sure<00:01:58.020> that<00:01:58.229> you're<00:01:58.380> thorough

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
want to make sure that you're thorough

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.050 
want to make sure that you're thorough
and<00:01:59.040> you<00:01:59.490> don't<00:01:59.640> have<00:01:59.759> to<00:01:59.850> worry<00:01:59.969> about

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
and you don't have to worry about

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.880 
and you don't have to worry about
putting<00:02:00.240> a<00:02:00.420> thin<00:02:00.600> coat<00:02:00.869> or<00:02:01.020> a<00:02:01.049> thick<00:02:01.350> coat<00:02:01.619> it

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
putting a thin coat or a thick coat it

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.620 
putting a thin coat or a thick coat it
really<00:02:02.399> doesn't<00:02:02.729> matter<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.060> thicker<00:02:03.509> the

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
really doesn't matter the thicker the

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.420 
really doesn't matter the thicker the
coat<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.140> longer<00:02:04.439> it<00:02:04.500> will<00:02:04.590> take<00:02:04.649> to<00:02:04.799> dry<00:02:05.159> so

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
coat the longer it will take to dry so

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.639 
coat the longer it will take to dry so
if<00:02:05.490> you<00:02:05.579> want<00:02:05.729> it<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:05.880> dry<00:02:06.090> in<00:02:06.329> one<00:02:06.810> night<00:02:07.079> or<00:02:07.350> in

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
if you want it to dry in one night or in

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.020 
if you want it to dry in one night or in
a<00:02:07.740> few<00:02:07.950> hours<00:02:07.979> you're<00:02:08.459> going<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.670> want<00:02:08.789> to<00:02:08.819> do<00:02:09.000> a

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
a few hours you're going to want to do a

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.880 
a few hours you're going to want to do a
thin<00:02:09.330> coats<00:02:09.690> then<00:02:10.410> I<00:02:10.619> would<00:02:10.770> recommend

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
thin coats then I would recommend

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.070 
thin coats then I would recommend
switching<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:11.760> a<00:02:11.790> paintbrush<00:02:12.390> which<00:02:12.720> you<00:02:12.870> see

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
switching to a paintbrush which you see

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.850 
switching to a paintbrush which you see
right<00:02:13.110> here

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
right here

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.690 
right here
to<00:02:14.040> get<00:02:14.250> just<00:02:14.490> that<00:02:14.580> splotchiness<00:02:15.450> away<00:02:16.200> and

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
to get just that splotchiness away and

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.240 
to get just that splotchiness away and
gone.i<00:02:17.750> it<00:02:18.750> kind<00:02:19.320> of<00:02:19.440> holds<00:02:19.740> glitter<00:02:19.950> a<00:02:20.040> little

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
gone.i it kind of holds glitter a little

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.920 
gone.i it kind of holds glitter a little
bit<00:02:20.370> more<00:02:20.520> if<00:02:20.610> you<00:02:20.640> don't<00:02:20.850> have<00:02:20.970> it<00:02:21.120> evenly<00:02:21.630> so

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
bit more if you don't have it evenly so

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.720 
bit more if you don't have it evenly so

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
if you do a thick or thin coat you want

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.540

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
it to be evenly spread if it's not even

it to be evenly spread if it's not even
the<00:02:26.970> glitter<00:02:27.210> will<00:02:27.480> clump<00:02:29.000> once<00:02:30.000> you<00:02:30.150> have<00:02:30.330> it

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
the glitter will clump once you have it

the glitter will clump once you have it
how<00:02:30.510> you<00:02:30.570> like<00:02:30.810> it<00:02:30.840> you<00:02:31.110> need<00:02:31.290> to<00:02:31.380> decide<00:02:31.680> what

how you like it you need to decide what

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.380 
how you like it you need to decide what

kind of glitter you want to use I'm

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.390 
kind of glitter you want to use I'm
using<00:02:33.480> this<00:02:33.810> light<00:02:34.080> purple<00:02:34.350> one<00:02:34.680> and<00:02:34.920> you<00:02:35.280> just

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
using this light purple one and you just

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
using this light purple one and you just
put<00:02:35.580> it<00:02:35.670> right<00:02:35.730> in<00:02:35.970> the<00:02:36.030> middle<00:02:36.180> I<00:02:36.390> put

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
put it right in the middle I put

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.330 
put it right in the middle I put
probably<00:02:37.050> about<00:02:37.170> half<00:02:37.410> of<00:02:37.530> it<00:02:37.680> inside<00:02:38.100> well

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
probably about half of it inside well

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.610 
probably about half of it inside well
maybe<00:02:38.490> a<00:02:38.580> quarter<00:02:38.880> of<00:02:39.180> it<00:02:39.300> and<00:02:39.450> I<00:02:40.080> just<00:02:40.350> started

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
maybe a quarter of it and I just started

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.220 
maybe a quarter of it and I just started
twisting<00:02:41.100> it<00:02:41.250> around<00:02:41.400> this<00:02:42.390> like<00:02:42.720> I<00:02:42.840> said<00:02:43.050> it's

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
twisting it around this like I said it's

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.750 
twisting it around this like I said it's
really<00:02:43.290> hard<00:02:43.500> but<00:02:43.920> thankfully<00:02:44.370> you<00:02:44.459> have<00:02:44.610> that

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
really hard but thankfully you have that

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:45.949 
really hard but thankfully you have that
wax<00:02:44.910> type<00:02:45.150> around<00:02:45.300> there<00:02:45.480> don't<00:02:45.720> worry<00:02:45.810> about

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
wax type around there don't worry about

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.900 
wax type around there don't worry about
making<00:02:46.170> a<00:02:46.440> mess<00:02:46.650> just<00:02:46.950> try<00:02:47.220> not<00:02:47.250> touch<00:02:47.670> it

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
making a mess just try not touch it

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.880 
making a mess just try not touch it
because<00:02:48.120> glitter<00:02:48.720> will<00:02:48.930> get<00:02:49.080> all<00:02:49.290> over<00:02:49.590> you

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
because glitter will get all over you

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.190 
because glitter will get all over you
but<00:02:50.490> you<00:02:50.580> just<00:02:50.730> want<00:02:50.910> to<00:02:51.000> circle<00:02:51.270> it<00:02:51.600> around<00:02:51.900> so

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
but you just want to circle it around so

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.100 
but you just want to circle it around so
then<00:02:52.350> it's<00:02:52.500> covering<00:02:53.489> all<00:02:53.760> sides<00:02:54.360> and<00:02:54.780> all<00:02:54.870> the

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
then it's covering all sides and all the

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.320 
then it's covering all sides and all the
Mod<00:02:55.260> Podge<00:02:55.530> and<00:02:55.830> it's<00:02:56.070> sticking<00:02:56.370> to<00:02:56.550> it<00:02:56.850> I<00:02:57.030> just

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
Mod Podge and it's sticking to it I just

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:58.729 
Mod Podge and it's sticking to it I just
went<00:02:57.630> ahead<00:02:57.690> and<00:02:57.810> fast<00:02:58.020> forward<00:02:58.290> this<00:02:58.440> so<00:02:58.680> you

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
went ahead and fast forward this so you

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.500 
went ahead and fast forward this so you
don't<00:02:59.040> have<00:02:59.130> to<00:02:59.430> watch<00:02:59.730> me<00:02:59.760> in<00:03:00.060> slow<00:03:00.300> motion

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
don't have to watch me in slow motion

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.540 
don't have to watch me in slow motion
mood<00:03:00.870> light<00:03:01.320> or<00:03:01.470> slow<00:03:01.739> motion<00:03:02.040> mode<00:03:02.220> to<00:03:02.400> do

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
mood light or slow motion mode to do

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:08.390 
mood light or slow motion mode to do
this<00:03:02.700> but<00:03:03.510> I<00:03:03.840> am<00:03:04.650> very<00:03:04.709> like<00:03:06.200> very<00:03:07.200> Oh<00:03:07.739> what<00:03:08.340> do
