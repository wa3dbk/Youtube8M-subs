00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
pretty good as it is array so we should

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.570 
pretty good as it is array so we should
see<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.770> little<00:01:14.610> more<00:01:14.790> smoother<00:01:15.299> graphics

hopefully some more detailed when it
comes<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.850> customization<00:01:21.270> because<00:01:22.080> I<00:01:22.110> only

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
comes to customization because I only

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.130
