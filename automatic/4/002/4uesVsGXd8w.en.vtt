00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.630 

I<00:00:34.079> think<00:00:35.079> the<00:00:35.200> curry<00:00:35.440> has<00:00:35.650> come<00:00:36.280> up<00:00:36.430> and

marketed to most South Africans who like

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.970 
marketed to most South Africans who like
to<00:00:51.070> cruise<00:00:51.610> more<00:00:52.120> but<00:00:53.110> with<00:00:53.380> a<00:00:53.410> much<00:00:53.710> more

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
to cruise more but with a much more

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.880 
to cruise more but with a much more
newer<00:00:54.250> technology<00:00:54.960> cruising<00:00:55.960> is<00:00:56.140> more<00:00:56.410> custom

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
newer technology cruising is more custom

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.850 
newer technology cruising is more custom
builds<00:00:57.310> much<00:00:57.520> more<00:00:57.820> slower<00:00:58.300> top<00:00:58.540> of<00:00:58.720> box<00:00:58.930> but

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860 
builds much more slower top of box but

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.100 
builds much more slower top of box but
the<00:01:00.040> muscle<00:01:00.220> bike<00:01:00.580> has<00:01:00.820> a<00:01:00.850> cruise<00:01:01.450> ability

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.110 
the muscle bike has a cruise ability

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.740 
the muscle bike has a cruise ability
that<00:01:02.830> has<00:01:03.100> new<00:01:03.370> technology<00:01:04.059> at<00:01:04.180> the<00:01:04.299> same<00:01:04.509> time

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:04.750 
that has new technology at the same time

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.640 
that has new technology at the same time
so<00:01:05.560> it's<00:01:06.100> a<00:01:06.250> kind<00:01:06.400> of<00:01:06.549> a<00:01:07.270> market<00:01:08.080> that's<00:01:08.170> really

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:08.650 
so it's a kind of a market that's really

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.469 
so it's a kind of a market that's really
more<00:01:08.799> in<00:01:08.979> X<00:01:09.189> in<00:01:09.400> writing<00:01:09.820> it's<00:01:10.270> not

more in X in writing it's not

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:12.090 
more in X in writing it's not
