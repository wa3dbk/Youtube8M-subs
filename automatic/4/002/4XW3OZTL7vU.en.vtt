00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.820
 only white chocolate we are going to 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:07.360
 place so that we are not seen 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:12.840
 our explosion we buy accounts no 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.840

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:23.769
 where the mice continued and followed 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:26.550
 well the pci where I went to the 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:26.550
 convicts 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:41.910
 with a white 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.070
 the metiche this one 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.230
 to the agenda not then are we going to 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:56.980
 place on this thing 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.440
 this taste that is already very damaged from its 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:04.240
 little head 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:07.320
 that's why 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.320
 I was very much 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:14.050
 okay 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:17.500
 They see how easy and very easy be entered 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:19.990
 observe the little bit this how much your 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.580
 head now how do we know this 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.100
 Worm we go that not only in camera 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:27.160
 but it 's like very immersed in the 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.530
 cake we're going to have to touch up these 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:35.900
 like putting them down so they do not 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:41.980
 see suspect is that it suggests nothing 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:41.980
 but an English team team is missing 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:50.870
 paint and chop on how your birthday is 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:55.950
 you will die today you have time 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:59.040
 I'm giving a previous one 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:01.140
 I'm here, I'm doing a channel 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.030
 with my sister compare we are 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.340
 making a channel for all the girls 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:08.129
 that are seeing us that are 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.260
 observing is a basis of a new channel 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:14.250
 we still do not know when it's going to come out 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:18.540
 we are in it and well wait for the girl 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:21.150
 the main cake the fake the one that has 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.979
 a rocket in there in that worm that 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.830
 He has a sad face and a fear because 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:30.260
 is going to explode this is more like 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.260
 has bewilderment 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:41.360
 because the great feat like 

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:48.300
 how I was happy no matter 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.300
 to see if they do not all die 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:56.950
 we are not very confectioners but if 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:00.550
 a time that will bring a pass today to me 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:02.290
 I love one that is the balloon that is 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:04.660
 thousand sheets and has some hoops up or 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:06.750
 innocence I love though almost never 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:10.270
 we take out the corridors for that reason they are 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.720
 and now we're going to do for karen 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.390
 the joke 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:17.330
 good girls as we saw that it did not work out 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:19.820
 the video did not come out the joke 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.140
 Well, I'm going to suggest how you can 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:23.450
 make the joke 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:26.360
 look at us your image is our 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:29.330
 candle is not our candle that this is the 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:31.370
 wax our mistake was this is the 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.290
 Mechita is not to be imagined with much 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:37.880
 imagination everything can be and what 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:40.190
 we did was put the wick through 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:42.590
 inside the candle or the wax 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:46.040
 then when the wax was burning 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:49.280
 our mistake was that she got stuck 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:54.350
 tapÃ³ covered that conduit and then no longer 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:56.600
 it exploded well it did not make lights then 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:59.540
 What I suggest is that they stick it 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:02.150
 out of the candle if they try to 

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:04.970
 with something so that they say no this does not 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:06.860
 is going to see and how transparent a 

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:09.410
 diuretic I do not know what's left what 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.880
 use and for people who want 

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:14.300
 use as a cue as that of 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:16.820
 we suggest you make a hole 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.420
 inside the cake because what he did 

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:20.820
 it was not 

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:23.070
 you have to open the rocket that is us 

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:26.400
 forgot you have to open the rocket to 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:28.140
 that explodes and did not open because 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.790
 everything was tight then that's why 

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:32.130
 we did not leave guys if they want to use 

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:36.090
 another can use another these do not 

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:38.940
 they need a lot of space and then guys 

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:42.330
 I hope you make this joke if you like it 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:45.450
 if he does send it sent waves by 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:48.150
 by message his jokes so he does not 

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:49.920
 we laughed a lot I was going to know that 

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:54.600
 you are liking them a lot 

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:57.590
 these good jokes Polynesian bye 

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.590
 this battery 

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:04.350
 because
