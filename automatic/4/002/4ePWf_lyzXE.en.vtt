 it's something very, very 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:20.030
 sentimental in the cf measure is

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:54.300
 and well this is something that leaves me very 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.570
 happy to represent argentina 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.830
 it may be the first change very 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.920
 argentina-2011 youngest story with 18 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.830
 years to be by the sticker 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.590
 because it was a very important title 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.610
 for the country a very important title 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.750
 to my life 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.700
 for my personal life 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.700
 I 'm always a dad since I was a kid 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.160
 I wanted to be a world champion can achieve 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.230
 that 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.910
 and then he went to sleep his eyes 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.850
 remember everything that happened if what 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:30.200
 train you if sacrifice and to perform 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:33.370
 a dream is very greeting 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.370
 very special is something 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.830
 and mental 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.810
 has a very good reason that my brother 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.930
 even though he runs by so 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.640
 they look like we're blood brothers I love it 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.450
 with Miami and we give a life for the 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.760
 other 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.099
 It is very good to have a hand 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.040
 like my brother that is bigger than 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:54.689
 his faith for him better than me and he has 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.189
 a lot of experience and is in the circuit 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:59.819
 worldwide among the 30 away from the world 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:03:01.890
 for me is the key is critical to 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:04.200
 that I get to know my goals 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.760
 because I have to whom it is to leave me and that 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.100
 be of my family and that is so close 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.620
 my own 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.820
 the truth is that the relationship is very good 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.010
 always as we are when we are 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.080
 stuck because we love being not with 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.090
 the other one and this year we're going to travel the 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.050
 most of the tournaments together and with my 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:22.920
 dad who is our coach 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:25.280
 and I as a boy with him always compete 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.140
 between us dresses a competition 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.730
 quiet healthy of brothers but always 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.160
 one trying to push the other and 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.900
 reaching the highest level 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.610
 I remember that he always changed for the 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.130
 street and we made race to know that it's already 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:41.610
 further away without such related memories 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:45.690
 to win and to compete that that we 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:49.530
 it feeds very much and until one day we 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:51.000
 we wake up the school and they lacked 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.980
 hospitalization is incredible to do as 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.450
 There were no waves and he left us the 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.490
 against 7 in the morning he goes with me 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.370
 brother and I good to see you stay 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:00.780
 more time in the water away than today 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.700
 we were not 7 in the morning and we 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.250
 we left at 6 in the afternoon not with me 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.280
 nothing had wrinkled hands like a 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:10.530
 90 year old center to be seen 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:13.260
 we always had things of that type that 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.510
 that motivated us always 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:19.260
 and as I said is a fundamental piece of 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:21.060
 my brother with me is the way that 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.250
 two we are going to throw very far for half 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.670
 because one is going 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.430
 at the other level the highest 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.870
 it is still the truth that it is quite 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.889
 sacrificed and how I want a 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.770
 athlete has to carry it 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:35.810
 My day starts early at 5 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.219
 way I wake up kin 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:39.000
 juan marino gym that my 

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:41.250
 physical trainer 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.930
 and it's a phenomenon not about person like 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.810
 professional in pulled out an injury 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:49.470
 very important knee 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:51.660
 and I start at five and until eight 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:55.470
 in the morning 7,008 a way training 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:58.139
 not only the physical part and then I come 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.840
 now I rest a little 

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:03.210
 eat food and I come to add from 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.070
 eight thirty nine in the morning and I 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.470
 I stay all day and in the night always 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:10.169
 I go to yoga or swim twice 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:12.660
 week and this does it like this from Monday to 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:14.580
 Monday in sacks a day of rest with 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.790
 I'm very tired and if I 'm not 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:19.520
 training 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:21.640
 and whole because I like it because I know that 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.230
 to be a champion you have to train and 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:26.600
 sacrifice because I believe that sacrifice 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:28.580
 tells me the simple monkey and without papers 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.860
 building is not doing our do not like 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.660
 that building is to do what it does not 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:34.710
 like to improve in what you like is 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.990
 the sacrifice 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:39.510
 and so I do because I think a lot 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:41.720
 people do not like you love experts in 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:45.600
 general is a little early it's cold 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:47.160
 but he is saying that I am 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.990
 turning off is the chest to where 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.990
 I want and I'm sure I 'll get there 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.790
 where do I want to because in the lake 

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:58.540
 stay and that not always the most 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:03.450
 important everything is a good person 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:03.450
 and dedicate yourself to the maximum in what you do
