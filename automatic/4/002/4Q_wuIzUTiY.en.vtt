off<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.310> shoulder<00:01:29.670> obviously<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.210> would<00:01:30.360> wear

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
off the shoulder obviously I would wear

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.270 
off the shoulder obviously I would wear
like<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:30.720> different<00:01:31.049> broad<00:01:31.200> fit<00:01:31.470> but<00:01:32.009> that's

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
like a different broad fit but that's

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.160 
like a different broad fit but that's
what<00:01:32.460> that<00:01:32.579> one<00:01:32.729> looks<00:01:32.759> like<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.390> then<00:01:33.750> the

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
what that one looks like and then the

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.810 
what that one looks like and then the
gray<00:01:34.470> one<00:01:34.680> looks<00:01:34.979> like<00:01:35.040> this<00:01:35.340> it's<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.640> short

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:12.450 
was it's so messy but honestly does not
matter<00:02:11.530> because<00:02:11.740> you're<00:02:11.920> gonna<00:02:12.040> be<00:02:12.160> cutting

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
matter because you're gonna be cutting

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.940 
matter because you're gonna be cutting
out<00:02:12.610> anyway<00:02:13.060> so<00:02:13.660> just<00:02:13.720> s3<00:02:14.290> wherever<00:02:14.650> you<00:02:14.770> want

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
your rips to be and then you could take

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.230 
your rips to be and then you could take
the<00:02:17.110> jeans<00:02:17.350> off<00:02:17.530> and<00:02:17.860> scrunch<00:02:18.730> up<00:02:18.850> the<00:02:19.030> piece

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
the jeans off and scrunch up the piece

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.540 
the jeans off and scrunch up the piece
in<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:19.420> middle<00:02:19.510> make<00:02:20.080> a<00:02:20.110> little<00:02:20.350> tiny<00:02:20.740> slit<00:02:21.310> in

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
in the middle make a little tiny slit in

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.310 
in the middle make a little tiny slit in
the<00:02:21.580> middle<00:02:22.090> of<00:02:22.210> it<00:02:22.330> and<00:02:22.510> then<00:02:22.930> you<00:02:23.020> can<00:02:23.140> start

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
the middle of it and then you can start

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.990 
the middle of it and then you can start
cutting<00:02:23.560> so<00:02:23.860> I<00:02:23.950> would<00:02:24.100> first<00:02:24.310> cut<00:02:24.610> straight

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
cutting so I would first cut straight

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.450 
cutting so I would first cut straight
across<00:02:25.060> so<00:02:25.390> you<00:02:25.600> just<00:02:25.840> have<00:02:25.990> one<00:02:26.290> slit<00:02:26.680> and<00:02:27.220> I

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
across so you just have one slit and I

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.670 
across so you just have one slit and I
made<00:02:27.670> it<00:02:27.760> a<00:02:27.850> bit<00:02:28.120> like<00:02:28.360> an<00:02:28.570> inch<00:02:28.930> or<00:02:29.200> so<00:02:29.380> away

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
made it a bit like an inch or so away

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.580 
made it a bit like an inch or so away
from<00:02:30.100> the<00:02:30.220> seam<00:02:30.460> but<00:02:31.180> you<00:02:31.570> can<00:02:31.720> honestly<00:02:31.870> do<00:02:32.380> as

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
from the seam but you can honestly do as

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.140 
from the seam but you can honestly do as
big<00:02:32.800> as<00:02:32.920> you<00:02:33.040> want<00:02:33.250> like<00:02:33.520> this<00:02:33.850> is<00:02:34.000> totally

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
big as you want like this is totally

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.270 
big as you want like this is totally
customizable<00:02:34.420> and<00:02:35.110> then<00:02:35.650> I<00:02:35.680> just<00:02:36.010> cut<00:02:36.160> the

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
customizable and then I just cut the

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.580 
customizable and then I just cut the
other<00:02:36.430> side<00:02:36.490> into<00:02:37.450> a<00:02:37.480> line<00:02:37.780> and<00:02:38.140> then<00:02:38.350> I

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
other side into a line and then I

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.460 
other side into a line and then I
started<00:02:38.920> cutting<00:02:39.220> out<00:02:39.400> my<00:02:39.760> holes<00:02:40.450> so<00:02:41.080> for<00:02:41.380> the

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470

started cutting out my holes so for the
holes<00:02:41.650> I<00:02:41.830> just<00:02:42.070> cut<00:02:42.400> a<00:02:42.430> semicircle<00:02:42.760> up<00:02:43.330> and

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
holes I just cut a semicircle up and

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.660 
holes I just cut a semicircle up and
depending<00:02:44.560> on<00:02:44.620> how<00:02:44.830> big<00:02:45.070> you<00:02:45.220> want<00:02:45.310> your<00:02:45.400> hold

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670

semicircle<00:02:47.320> so<00:02:47.920> I<00:02:47.950> just<00:02:48.160> mean<00:02:48.340> mine

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
semicircle so I just mean mine

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.060 
semicircle so I just mean mine
relatively<00:02:49.360> large<00:02:49.660> I<00:02:49.870> would<00:02:49.989> say<00:02:50.200> larger<00:02:50.890> than

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
relatively large I would say larger than

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.160 
relatively large I would say larger than
my<00:02:51.190> black<00:02:51.430> jeans<00:02:51.700> which<00:02:51.940> you'll<00:02:52.120> see<00:02:52.180> and<00:02:52.930> I

my black jeans which you'll see and I
just<00:02:53.200> did<00:02:53.500> that<00:02:53.590> on<00:02:53.650> the<00:02:53.800> top<00:02:54.040> and<00:02:54.310> then<00:02:54.489> I

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
just did that on the top and then I

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.070 
just did that on the top and then I
cleaned<00:02:54.940> up<00:02:55.030> the<00:02:55.090> edges<00:02:55.570> because<00:02:55.870> they

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
cleaned up the edges because they

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.630 
cleaned up the edges because they
weren't<00:02:56.260> obviously<00:02:56.800> like<00:02:57.010> the<00:02:57.130> best<00:02:57.340> as<00:02:57.610> you

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
weren't obviously like the best as you

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.330 
weren't obviously like the best as you
can<00:02:57.850> see<00:02:58.060> so<00:02:58.750> you<00:02:58.840> can<00:02:58.989> do<00:02:59.080> that<00:02:59.230> and<00:02:59.530> fix<00:03:00.160> that

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
can see so you can do that and fix that

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.680 
can see so you can do that and fix that
all<00:03:00.550> up<00:03:00.790> and<00:03:01.000> then<00:03:01.209> you're<00:03:01.330> just<00:03:01.450> going<00:03:01.600> to

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
all up and then you're just going to

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.090 
all up and then you're just going to
want<00:03:01.810> to<00:03:01.870> cut<00:03:02.019> out<00:03:02.140> the<00:03:02.260> bottom<00:03:02.410> part<00:03:02.830> as<00:03:02.950> well

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
want to cut out the bottom part as well

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.729 
want to cut out the bottom part as well
and<00:03:03.430> then<00:03:03.940> you<00:03:03.970> have<00:03:04.300> your<00:03:04.720> hole<00:03:05.320> in<00:03:05.560> your

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
and then you have your hole in your

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:14.880 
and then you have your hole in your
jeans

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.479 

next<00:03:15.890> you're<00:03:15.980> just<00:03:16.010> gonna<00:03:16.250> take<00:03:16.400> your

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
next you're just gonna take your

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.010 
next you're just gonna take your
tweezers<00:03:16.700> and<00:03:17.090> literally<00:03:17.330> just<00:03:17.450> start<00:03:17.810> like

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
tweezers and literally just start like

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.770 
tweezers and literally just start like
pulling<00:03:18.650> strands<00:03:19.250> out<00:03:19.400> from<00:03:19.910> the<00:03:20.300> whole

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
pulling strands out from the whole

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.270 
pulling strands out from the whole
circle<00:03:21.260> so<00:03:21.500> I<00:03:21.530> just<00:03:21.830> went<00:03:21.980> around<00:03:22.040> the<00:03:22.190> whole

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
circle so I just went around the whole

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.040 
circle so I just went around the whole
circle<00:03:22.550> and<00:03:22.670> did<00:03:22.760> that<00:03:22.940> this<00:03:23.510> just<00:03:23.690> makes<00:03:23.840> it<00:03:23.959> a

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
circle and did that this just makes it a

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:25.990 
circle and did that this just makes it a
little<00:03:24.170> bit<00:03:24.379> more<00:03:24.680> messy<00:03:24.950> but<00:03:25.489> then<00:03:25.610> this<00:03:25.849> is

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
little bit more messy but then this is

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.309 
little bit more messy but then this is
not<00:03:26.180> going<00:03:26.269> to<00:03:26.330> be<00:03:26.420> the<00:03:26.480> finished<00:03:26.750> product<00:03:27.140> you

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:27.319 
not going to be the finished product you

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:29.259 
not going to be the finished product you
probably<00:03:27.920> could<00:03:28.160> keep<00:03:28.340> it<00:03:28.489> like<00:03:28.610> this<00:03:28.640> I<00:03:29.000> just

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
probably could keep it like this I just

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.150 
probably could keep it like this I just
think<00:03:29.629> it<00:03:29.720> doesn't<00:03:29.900> look<00:03:30.050> as<00:03:30.349> good<00:03:30.470> right<00:03:30.860> now

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
think it doesn't look as good right now

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.130 
think it doesn't look as good right now
but<00:03:31.550> you'll<00:03:32.000> see<00:03:32.209> what<00:03:32.330> I<00:03:32.360> do<00:03:32.450> to<00:03:32.630> make<00:03:32.870> it<00:03:33.019> look

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
but you'll see what I do to make it look

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:42.610 
but you'll see what I do to make it look
nicer

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.540 

once<00:03:43.620> you're<00:03:43.710> done<00:03:43.800> with<00:03:43.920> that<00:03:44.070> this<00:03:44.220> is<00:03:44.400> what

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
once you're done with that this is what

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:45.710 
once you're done with that this is what
she'll<00:03:44.790> look<00:03:44.940> like<00:03:45.000> and<00:03:45.390> now<00:03:45.480> you're<00:03:45.630> just

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
she'll look like and now you're just

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.300 
she'll look like and now you're just
gonna<00:03:45.810> want<00:03:46.050> to<00:03:46.110> take<00:03:46.260> your<00:03:46.380> jeans<00:03:46.680> and<00:03:46.950> throw
