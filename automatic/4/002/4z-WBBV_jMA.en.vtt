00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.620
 cobos and compass and welcome to another 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.620
 new video and how they saw it in the 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.780
 title lizard squat against anonymous 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.580
 hacker war and if something is what 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.320
 I want to talk today because 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.990
 recently some have been seen 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.210
 little things which are extremely 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.820
 rare and the truth that they give a lot of that 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.950
 kate recently in the account 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.020
 main good what I think it is can 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:28.619
 be or is the main account of 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:31.350
 anonymous that is called your own news have 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.809
 I left some things and some things 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:35.489
 they were saying no I was 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.230
 waiting to make this video until 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.300
 I had seen that they will stop studying 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.670
 things because every time I recharged the 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.589
 page they said things and things and things and 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.629
 Now is the moment I think it 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:47.940
 they do not say more things does not explain the 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.969
 twitter and they say that their last tweet is to 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.649
 an hour ago I did not say good is already 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.899
 good to do this and I can give them some 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.229
 little things of what to speak good you already 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.459
 you will know the group of anonymous are 

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:01.469
 we could say that the group of hackers 

00:00:59.459 --> 00:01:03.929
 most famous or at least one of the most 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.570
 powerful and famous and then only in 

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:09.370
 your main account has one 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.590
 4 million followers no longer 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.110
 imagine that powerful and great will be 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.880
 it's a pretty famous hacker network 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.650
 but already happening a little bit of this we go 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.960
 to speak a little bit you do not remember 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.510
 that the licey squad has recently 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.270
 sent a finger attack to what is going 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:28.720
 being playstation on your servers the 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.730
 network and also to xbox live not and 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.770
 you will know that many people were 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.600
 angry indeed the owner of mega them 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.790
 are more accounts to settle as the 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.010
 debt and being able to let people play and 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.500
 we could say that in part the owner of 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.090
 mega except what doing christmas 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.190
 but what happened afterwards they followed 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.020
 some attacks and the servers do not 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.060
 they served until now until today 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.770
 playstation servers do not work 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.350
 and connect in which with your friends and 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.720
 you can only play offline then 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.860
 inside the twitter of anonymous which 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.840
 I'll be leaving them in the 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.670
 description I'm going to leave two the 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.550
 main and one in which I've read of 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:07.150
 pretty important information in the 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:09.640
 which tells us and tells us just such things 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.380
 let's make one thing clear it's not about 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.230
 of playstation network or xbox 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.180
 it's about everything and it does not make sense that they 're 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.540
 doing that to say it in some way 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:23.230
 and then they put a tweet just like that is 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.850
 time to take these lizards ok and as 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.220
 if they were making a reference or 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.840
 he mocks the people of lizarra squad because 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.240
 you will know that that day as 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.640
 squad of lizards or of the 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.860
 lizards then how do they see it come 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:38.410
 many things like that on your twitter and then 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.960
 right after they tell us things should 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.940
 to be clear the slate squad the 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.460
 squad of lizards are just 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.520
 able to perform finger attacks not 

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:51.160
 they are more they are nothing they can only not 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.470
 can equal the attack of day 0 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.270
 then how do they see it they are basically 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.370
 saying that they are not as powerful as 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.530
 they can then be released 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.630
 some guerrilla besides that I 've 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.550
 put on a page which many say 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.650
 things so just if you guys 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.420
 they want to read it, just get in touch 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.700
 to the second twitter because there are two 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.860
 tweeters is the main one and in what 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.410
 they are called anonymous arbino in which we 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:17.370
 they say news and some little things like that and 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:20.650
 in that what he is telling us is 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.900
 thus anonymous declare war on the isr 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.410
 squad the hacker team who has thrown 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.210
 the playstation and xbox servers 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.800
 networks at Christmas, never the truth 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:31.750
 is that it was pretty bad and here 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.780
 you can see some tweets from the 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:37.810
 which they did with kim down with who.com 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.790
 the mega owner and various things like that and 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.710
 done if you get to go what you're going 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.080
 doing the main anonymous channel 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:45.520
 just look for anonymous and when 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.620
 see a channel with Popcorn 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:50.080
 verified simply when they see that 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.900
 they enter there and there is a video which 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.820
 it's called second notice analyze the squad 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.530
 and there you can realize that it is a 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.180
 war between that anyway this 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.610
 video is that you did not like me 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.280
 I simply do them to inform myself 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:05.170
 I think it's bad enough that they do 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.510
 this do not remove it delimit after 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.680
 because at the end of the day they do not fuck 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.780
 so much to the company but that 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.070
 truly those who fuck are the 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.290
 players and the people who want 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.180
 enjoy your console and more now that 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.220
 the big guys are on vacation 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.870
 and they can not play because a group of 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.609
 hackers is making these happen 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.260
 bad times does not make you look for I do not know if 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.190
 they look for fame money you tell me what 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.470
 say the comments 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.540
 and what do they think of the intervention of 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.070
 anonymous that seems anonymous as 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.690
 that he had said something common and that he 

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:34.120
 they plan now to do nothing if it is 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.470
 they do not do anything and right now like that 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.360
 I hype them with wet ones because they have 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.790
 got with the project lathe that with 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.620
 I think that you enter some places 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:44.680
 to the dark site of the internet and some 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.060
 little things like that because I do not know no 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.380
 there is or just comes to talk about 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.970
 this war in which like what you see 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.620
 that is getting closer between hackers and 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.270
 I want you to tell me your opinion 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.980
