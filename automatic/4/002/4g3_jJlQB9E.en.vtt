00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
never clean it because we think that the

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.710 
never clean it because we think that the
hot<00:00:29.130> water<00:00:29.369> that<00:00:29.519> flows<00:00:29.880> through<00:00:29.910> it<00:00:30.269> is<00:00:30.420> just

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
hot water that flows through it is just

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.120 
hot water that flows through it is just
fine<00:00:30.990> no<00:00:31.410> big<00:00:31.439> deal

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
fine no big deal

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.819 
fine no big deal
think<00:00:32.610> about<00:00:32.759> it<00:00:32.969> what<00:00:33.510> does<00:00:33.930> mold<00:00:34.260> bacteria

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.080 
what do they love moist warm
environments<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.370> that's<00:00:38.489> what<00:00:38.670> you<00:00:38.760> create

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
environments and that's what you create

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.780 
environments and that's what you create
in<00:00:39.210> these<00:00:39.329> coffee<00:00:39.570> makers<00:00:39.989> so<00:00:40.140> we<00:00:40.260> actually

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 
in these coffee makers so we actually

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.860 
in these coffee makers so we actually
did<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:41.820> little<00:00:41.969> test<00:00:42.239> on<00:00:42.450> one<00:00:42.629> of<00:00:42.750> our

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
did a little test on one of our

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.160 
did a little test on one of our
producers<00:00:43.260> coffee<00:00:43.950> maker<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:45.170> basically

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
found bacteria that's found in stagnant

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.810 
found bacteria that's found in stagnant

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
you could actually be passing some of

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.429 
you could actually be passing some of
this<00:01:14.220> onto<00:01:14.610> them<00:01:14.820> yeah<00:01:15.119> so<00:01:15.270> that's<00:01:15.509> but

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
this onto them yeah so that's but

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.219 
this onto them yeah so that's but
luckily<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.340> doctors<00:01:17.939> are<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.689> rescue

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
luckily the doctors are to the rescue

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.840 
luckily the doctors are to the rescue
with<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.830> very<00:01:20.400> SAS<00:01:20.790> illusion

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
with a very SAS illusion

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.780 
with a very SAS illusion
drink<00:01:23.850> vinegar<00:01:24.090> instead<00:01:24.750> right<00:01:25.310> no<00:01:26.310> that<00:01:26.700> was

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
drink vinegar instead right no that was

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.340 
drink vinegar instead right no that was
you<00:01:26.850> don't<00:01:27.030> drink<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.330> Viggen<00:01:27.570> no<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:27.869> don't

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
you don't drink the Viggen no you don't

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.010 
you don't drink the Viggen no you don't
but<00:01:28.500> what<00:01:28.650> you<00:01:28.770> do<00:01:28.950> is<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.549> use<00:01:29.850> vinegar<00:01:30.210> to

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
but what you do is you use vinegar to

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.780 
but what you do is you use vinegar to
sanitize<00:01:31.530> your<00:01:31.740> coffeemaker<00:01:32.130> it's<00:01:32.520> made<00:01:32.670> of

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
sanitize your coffeemaker it's made of

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.460 
sanitize your coffeemaker it's made of
five<00:01:32.939> percent<00:01:33.180> acetic<00:01:33.420> acid<00:01:33.900> which<00:01:34.079> should

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
five percent acetic acid which should

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.010 
five percent acetic acid which should
kill<00:01:35.159> most<00:01:35.400> of<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.670> bacteria<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:36.509> acts

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
kill most of the bacteria it acts

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.350 
kill most of the bacteria it acts
essentially<00:01:37.560> as<00:01:37.680> an<00:01:37.770> anesthetic<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:38.490> the

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
essentially as an anesthetic and the

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.590 
essentially as an anesthetic and the
only<00:01:39.869> x-factor<00:01:40.409> here<00:01:40.650> is<00:01:41.060> you<00:01:42.060> have<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.390> run

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
only x-factor here is you have to run

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.899 
only x-factor here is you have to run
water<00:01:43.110> through<00:01:43.259> multiple<00:01:44.159> times<00:01:44.369> after

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
water through multiple times after

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.609 
water through multiple times after
because<00:01:45.270> instead<00:01:45.659> of<00:01:45.750> her<00:01:45.840> coffees<00:01:46.229> not<00:01:46.439> that

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
because instead of her coffees not that

through<00:02:11.280> multiple<00:02:11.610> times<00:02:11.760> that's<00:02:11.940> a<00:02:12.000> vent

I might get some old coffee grounds and
just<00:02:15.040> throw<00:02:15.790> away<00:02:15.970> a<00:02:16.000> bag<00:02:16.240> for<00:02:16.630> where<00:02:16.840> I

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
just throw away a bag for where I

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:17.340 
just throw away a bag for where I
