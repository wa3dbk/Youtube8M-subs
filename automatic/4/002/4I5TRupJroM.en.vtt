00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.950
 in the first after we connect this 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:30.970
 we connect to the control 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:34.840
 we give ourselves something that we have to be 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:37.420
 updated to 6.16 by means of the 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:40.720
 computer is updated and there is already a 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:43.680
 six here in general 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.680
 it sounds general 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.150
 general about 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.110

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.110
 6.1 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:01:01.560
 6.1 is what matters most then 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.560
 let's go to puntocom vision 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:09.109
 and with a circle with a circle 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.109
 a dot com 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.070
 they will choose their service 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:20.240
 this is what will be ready I am here is 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.820
 for him if it 's windows sting him here in 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:26.670
 my mac 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.670
 you are stung here crisis 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.890
 and started installing something here 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.909
 when you just installed that thing you 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.670
 double click 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:39.909
 they give him revenge 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.179
 lack 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:45.369
 and it's going to look like something that says this 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:47.939
 then you catch the faller what 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:47.939
 they put here 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.810
 these were the click-to-close data 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:56.150
 the rest do not need the ball here 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.030
 let's go here 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.490
 for my ex and already have their application here 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.600
 he opens it 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.850
 and for the open 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.840
 and we can apply this button that 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.880
 for me that I have this application 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.190
 So now I'm going to erase it because 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.959
 I already have it repeated 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.360
 then we will give you original that I 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.550
 I have here and this will appear 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.960
 button 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:23.090
 from 0.20 to 6.1 and what we are going to do 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.940

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:31.070

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:38.569
 all things that have ios 6 and 16.1 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:41.450
 from 6.1 out of 6 up 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:43.000
 they have not read anything, they just bite him 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.580
 I break 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.920
 that will take a few minutes and with the 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.470
 face here they are going to have a program that 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.360
 call sidya and the video I'm going to 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.220
 continue when this is over good I'll 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.170
 to make another video about that here 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.810
 an application appears here here in 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.459
 the next page that is called sidya c 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.920
 yd 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.140
 cydia and with this we can start 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.430
 hack so this is a video and of 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.620
 this I will do a continuation of 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.540
 many videos that I will continue doing 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.490
 so thanks for watching and here we see 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.920
 Bye retirement and then when you go 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:17.680
 process like this and little by little already until 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.530
 can fill it and they can disconnect it and go 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.180
 to have a symbol here that is already 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.030
 well here then also appears Syrian 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:29.010
 but a symbol already appears that you 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:32.020
 this before I did not have it this is me break 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.730
 and when this ends the hairline this 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.430
 break symbol is going to change well 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.730
 day and it's going to be a thing like coffee a 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.730
 small box 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.849
 because he's not ready but they're going to sting him 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.780
 and I'll explain in another video like that 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:47.780
 that was a pleasure and bye
