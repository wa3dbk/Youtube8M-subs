00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.820
 if you had to explain to a layman 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.170
 that architecture grant this 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:16.139
 explanation is the shelter of 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.810
 Man is something made by man for man 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:22.260
 and the scale of man 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.630
 the rest is is talk 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.480
 architecture over the years has not 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.730
 change our lives it has been this one 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.309
 greater form of a smaller form 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.860
 in the residence the cathedral but 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.690
 basically this concept always reminds 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.269
 the words of the back has no way 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.670
 I would start by talking like this the architecture is 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:45.059
 construction before but in the construction area 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:50.010
 construction and reconstruction is 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:52.949
 made for a particular purpose 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.930
 that is a program is made by 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:01:01.229
 certain season is made in a 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:03.809
 certain place is made with 

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:07.200
 certain intention has to take into 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.840
 attention to culture has a sense I 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.960
 thus explain the architecture is a 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.750
 specialized entity of professionals 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.229
 who have a background and knowledge 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:22.289
 about how to build a 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.770
 appropriate way to interact with 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:29.549
 best the set of needs of the 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.759
 a client with their budget and how 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:36.119
 turn everything into a good 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.009
 the efficient and pleasant building that 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.039
 meet your goals and can only 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.810
 think of production and architect as 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:44.490
 architect or as an architect 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.979
 connected to urban 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.380
 then the detailed explanation that 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.689
 who produces what I do what is not 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.700
 I'm more interested, is this 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:59.460
 relationship to be understood from the outset 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:02.340
 is a cost minimization is a better 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.109
 realization of their living spaces 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.469
 live in the widest possible sense 

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:09.390
 this residence is not the 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:14.540
 architecture has to come against is 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.540
 sensei of judo of the population of the cities 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:22.060
 aesthetic and therefore a strong 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:25.630
 subjective factor in this creation 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:28.930
 I believe what she for having this 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.460
 condition is that something more than the 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.490
 architect is capable of 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.710
 to achieve that good. 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.960
 being to bring you that one 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:40.780
 spiritual satisfaction that the architecture 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:43.510
 of the problem, however, the architecture 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.970
 also a very practical activity. 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.880
 very objective and can respond 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.680
 very specific to the wishes and 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.790
 needs of a society 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.050
 complex 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:59.140
 the prouni spaces she takes care of it is 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:01.270
 take care of the place where man occupies all 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.210
 spaces for the work to bring 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.100
 the parents live the parties will be 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:10.090
 health issue of architecture is very 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:12.640
 wide and I know what I do 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:16.150
 within the architecture that is already 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:21.790
 a part if it is not significant but a 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:24.840
 part is perhaps better known from the 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:27.790
 that is working with projects 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.810
 first is the architecture linked to the 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.320
 indication 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:36.700
 the architect and the architect he has the 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:40.120
 planning function and organize 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:43.950
 spaces where people will go 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:46.510
 lived to work and in that sense the 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:49.090
 architecture beyond this organization 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:52.660
 she has an expression an expression 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:55.600
 artistic aesthetic this logical symbol 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.730
 which in a way marks the relations of 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:01.420
 people obnoxious people with places 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:04.020
 they they they live they live 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.020
 job 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:13.140
 is the portion of space is space 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:17.940
 three - dimensional plane will have action of the ceiling 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:21.419
 but with delta plus what if israel 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:25.710
 emotion as a good work of art 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:29.850
 predicts something forward so it has a 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:32.729
 reflective sense of society and the 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.930
 same time a prospective sense in the 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:37.199
 society 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:40.070
 which makes architecture an art 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:43.919
 very interesting because it is complete 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:48.360
 because often the very 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:52.139
 architecture may indicate some path 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:55.979
 better organization of space as 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:59.789
 social use the way in which 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:01.919
 man builds the world that there is a 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:06.270
 world that does not yet exist 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:07.500
 I think all that civilization 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.680
 human 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:14.159
 in the main trajectory of the last 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:16.770
 10,000 years built has much to see 

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:18.930
 with an architecture 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.690
 I find it interesting that the 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:23.639
 absence of architecture also builds 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:27.000
 the world that there is a world that does not 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:30.240
 exists but it seems to me more 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.210
 idea if one imagines that the world 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:37.400
 there is no desirable and 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.400
 fashion architecture that world
