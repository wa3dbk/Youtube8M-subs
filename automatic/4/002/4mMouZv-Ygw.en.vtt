00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:08.099
 Hi guys, how are you? I'm a boy. Video de 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.080
 I'm going to talk about the guilt today. 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.880
 john green stars 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.969
 This is the first stage of the challenge. 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.980
 books your 2014 movies that I can 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.140
 public on the day then if you have not yet 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.029
 know the challenge I'll leave the link 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.900
 of the post here below in the box of 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.420
 information 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.180
 There I explain everything as the idea came 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.250
 because I challenge how to participate and have a 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.750
 and also contact email if you 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.820
 Want to ask questions 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.750
 It's still time, although we're already in the 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.000
 month 6 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.920
 You still have time to participate if you 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.930
 It interests me, I think it's worth mentioning. 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.960
 I also did a review of this 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.120
 The book March 2013 is based on her 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.100
 I'm recording this video, I do not 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.170
 I liked this book so much, I think. 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.420
 cool make this clear to you guys 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.770
 from the beginning I will also leave in the 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.020
 information box 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.180
 The post I made for the stars 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.949
 and as at the time did not use synopsis and I 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.350
 I'll also leave the link to the scope of this 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.019
 even though he believed that the majority of 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.820
 of you must already imagine about what 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.580
 if it comes then let's go to the point 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.409
 Let's talk about the guilt of the stars. 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.600
 I 'll start by telling you the 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.030
 I did not like it for you to understand. 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.130
 because I'm not part of this group that 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.020
 It's a super book fan I'm not saying. 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.299
 That's why I thought it was bad. 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.799
 worth reading bringing that to me it does not 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.619
 worked how it works for most 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.119
 of you I waited for time to pass 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.310
 after the launch because normally 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.280
 these books that are very loved I do not 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.590
 I like that I'm sure if I had 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.140
 read the first impressions soon after 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.939
 I would have tested this book then 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.090
 a way was very good for me that is 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.390
 expected a few months ago in the beginning 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.280
 book was really enjoying everything from 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:50.670
 characters from the history of the 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.530
 man but one of the main reasons why 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.659
 I did not like this book so much 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.299
 is that soon afterwards I have to participate 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.219
 kings is what is the main character and the 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.590
 From there I could not get over myself. 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.840
 hold her I could not cheer anymore 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.479
 for them tie 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.330
 she likes herself, she knows 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.830
 begins with a super needle head yes 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.720
 well controlled 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.030
 taking into account the situation she lives in 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.489
 She has parents who are always there to 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.129
 support her in some moments of the book 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:20.299
 she has a personality oscillation 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:22.940
 very big 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:24.920
 I even mentioned this in the text in some 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.440
 moments is understandable 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.209
 these mood swings she has more 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.250
 at other times I found a little 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.269
 the transformation of the 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.299
 character 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:38.329
 So I assign it to this very item. 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:41.329
 enjoying the august's too much and saying 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:43.099
 with all the certainty that for me he should 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:45.739
 to have been a foreground character 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:48.349
 although I understand that the young man had a 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:51.410
 real inspiration to write history 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:54.110
 I attribute the fact that I have not sympathized 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.840
 with the hasel is from start to finish at the beginning 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.310
 Yes, but then I've already created the 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.810
 antipathy for her 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.239
 the main reason for not liking 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:05.090
 both in this book and the second 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:07.280
 objective is very particular in its 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.079
 most of you may not agree 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.750
 with me will depend on how each one 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:13.579
 feel this moment of history but in a 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.209
 certain moment there will be a 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:20.090
 travel in with the main characters 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:24.349
 and although the reason for the trip is 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:27.200
 interesting I eat as a reader does not 

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:30.380
 I would do it but I found it interesting as 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.359
 things happen I find the inconvenience 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.669
 too much for a book that has a 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:37.489
 a contemporary proposal dealing with a 

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:39.829
 very contemporary theme I think 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:43.099
 made this part of history much easier. 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:45.950
 which is already more than half to the end 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:49.069
 so although it's interesting why 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:52.459
 the reason how it mounts like it 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:55.040
 builds is the situation of this trip I 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:57.019
 I find it a little forced, there's another one. 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.079
 element to finalize the things I 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:02.900
 I did not like that it also bothered a little 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:04.819
 violent is a very sexy narrative 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.640
 a text that speaks as much as the public 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:09.460
 young as with the public more 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.680
 the duct but I felt in this book and at 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:14.500
 I've read reviews on others this. 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:17.890
 also happens that the din and it has a 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:20.200
 a certain need to prove himself nerd knows 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:22.810
 then in some moments what introduces 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.180
 here is funny is relaxed 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.190
 It gets fun sometimes it comes from a 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.470
 a little more dramatic moment makes the 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.780
 break with some joke or some 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.370
 a joke in this genre but in my 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.169
 opinion this appears with much 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:37.570
 how often do you know 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:40.240
 prove all the time through the 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:42.430
 characters that he is the doctor then 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.050
 This bothered me a bit though the 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:47.100
 two previous reasons that I quoted 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:50.710
 Have been the main ones for me. 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.730
 motives of dislike of the same colombo 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.710
 with reading 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:55.870
 Good people since I commented on what 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.910
 I did not like the book, too, of course. 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.070
 comment on what I liked the most 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.930
 I walked three brothers with him at skoob guess 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:05.710
 which I was quite reasonable taking in 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:08.050
 account is the euphoria that existed around 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.240
 it's because I did not like it so much 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:12.790
 so I was not thrilled that he had not 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.160
 become a favorite or touch my 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:16.750
 Heart was a good book but in my case 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.300
 did not do that 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:23.350
 and I really liked the augusto, I think he 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:26.229
 very real, it's a boy that we 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:28.630
 so you could find on the street and 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:29.500
 sometime in our time. 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.720
 life 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.580
 I also really liked the friend of 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.410
 augusto's that unfortunately I'm not going 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:38.500
 remember the name now I noted in some 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:40.990
 place here not to forget and I forgot 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:44.260
 besides the name where I made this notation 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:47.800
 Then realized how organized it is but 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:49.720
 taking this into account I really liked it 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.000
 character he breaks some 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:55.150
 moments of the book so to me 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.190
 were boring more monotonous than it was 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:59.560
 a little more focused saline couple then 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:02.289
 to me he brought this break I also 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:04.930
 too liked the fathers of kings I 

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:06.460
 especially her father, her father is 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:08.470
 described as a very emotional man 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:10.060
 something that is not common 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:12.669
 Good, I think this is what I have for 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:15.569
 speak without running the risk of 

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:17.429
 other important moments in history 

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:19.740
 Let's talk about him in 

00:06:17.429 --> 00:06:23.099
