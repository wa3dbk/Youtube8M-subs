00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
love with the 9000 so I decided to go

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.130

back<00:00:39.629> to<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.930> 9000<00:00:40.800> because<00:00:41.629> the<00:00:42.629> the

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
back to the 9000 because the the

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.529 
back to the 9000 because the the
keyboard<00:00:43.620> of<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.070> 9000<00:00:44.640> is<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.910> best<00:00:45.180> so<00:00:45.510> far

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
keyboard of the 9000 is the best so far

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.010 
keyboard of the 9000 is the best so far
and<00:00:45.930> I<00:00:45.989> can<00:00:46.140> type<00:00:46.379> really<00:00:46.829> really<00:00:47.370> fast<00:00:48.020> which

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
and I can type really really fast which

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.380 
and I can type really really fast which
was<00:00:49.500> not<00:00:49.680> able<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:49.980> do<00:00:50.219> on<00:00:50.340> my<00:00:51.260> 9700<00:00:52.760> so<00:00:53.760> once

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
was not able to do on my 9700 so once

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.130 
was not able to do on my 9700 so once
again<00:00:54.539> if<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.199> want<00:00:55.640> the<00:00:56.640> last<00:00:56.879> device<00:00:57.629> the

placement<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:20.970> this<00:01:21.119> device<00:01:21.509> meaning<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.409> very

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
placement of this device meaning a very

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.149 
placement of this device meaning a very
big<00:01:23.159> large<00:01:23.670> keyboard<00:01:24.590> with<00:01:25.590> something<00:01:25.979> that

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
big large keyboard with something that

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.170 
big large keyboard with something that
really<00:01:26.369> feels<00:01:26.850> like<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.299> flagship<00:01:28.229> device

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
really feels like a flagship device

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.160 
really feels like a flagship device
because<00:01:30.180> you<00:01:30.509> know<00:01:30.630> all<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:30.990> last

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
because you know all the last

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.810 
because you know all the last
BlackBerry's<00:01:31.860> looks<00:01:32.520> all<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.360> same

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.450 

I<00:01:35.850> don't<00:01:36.570> have<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.840> 9700<00:01:37.740> anymore<00:01:38.070> because<00:01:38.250> I

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
I don't have the 9700 anymore because I

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.090 
I don't have the 9700 anymore because I
sold<00:01:38.759> it<00:01:38.909> last<00:01:39.060> week<00:01:39.360> but<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:39.960> have<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:40.799> dummy

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
sold it last week but I have a dummy

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.060 
sold it last week but I have a dummy
dummy<00:01:41.310> one<00:01:42.380> so<00:01:43.380> we<00:01:43.500> can<00:01:43.680> just<00:01:44.610> compare<00:01:45.210> them

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
dummy one so we can just compare them

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.410 
dummy one so we can just compare them
side-by-side<00:01:47.119> and<00:01:48.119> you<00:01:49.159> can<00:01:50.159> see<00:01:50.399> that<00:01:50.610> the

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
side-by-side and you can see that the

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.100 
side-by-side and you can see that the
new<00:01:51.570> board<00:01:51.840> is<00:01:52.159> extremely<00:01:53.299> small<00:01:54.299> compared<00:01:55.079> to

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
new board is extremely small compared to

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.920 
new board is extremely small compared to
the<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:56.100> old<00:01:56.310> one<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:56.790> I<00:01:57.600> really<00:01:57.750> have

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
the the old one and I really have

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.459 
the the old one and I really have
problems<00:01:58.439> typing<00:01:58.950> fast<00:01:59.310> with<00:01:59.759> these<00:01:59.880> keyboard

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:00.469 
problems typing fast with these keyboard

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:03.230 
problems typing fast with these keyboard
problems<00:02:01.469> that<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.710> don't<00:02:01.920> have<00:02:02.070> it<00:02:02.219> that<00:02:02.520> one

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
problems that I don't have it that one

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.830 
problems that I don't have it that one
and<00:02:05.570> the<00:02:06.570> bold<00:02:06.810> 9650<00:02:07.560> is<00:02:08.090> right<00:02:09.090> in<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.690> middle

and the bold 9650 is right in the middle

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.199 
and the bold 9650 is right in the middle
you<00:02:10.459> see

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
you see

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.520 
you see

the smallest the medium the biggest and

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.240 
the smallest the medium the biggest and
let's<00:02:16.530> continue<00:02:17.099> to<00:02:17.370> compare<00:02:18.769> we<00:02:19.769> can<00:02:19.920> compare

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
let's continue to compare we can compare

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.360 
let's continue to compare we can compare
with<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.519> original<00:02:21.300> storm<00:02:21.690> one<00:02:22.099> you<00:02:23.099> can<00:02:23.250> see

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
with the original storm one you can see

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.479 
with the original storm one you can see
that<00:02:23.519> there<00:02:23.700> they<00:02:24.360> are<00:02:24.390> almost<00:02:24.629> identical<00:02:25.489> you

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
that there they are almost identical you

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:29.330 
that there they are almost identical you
see<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:26.970> top<00:02:27.180> of<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.650> 9650<00:02:28.650> with<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:28.980> top<00:02:29.160> of

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
see the top of the 9650 with the top of

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.979 
see the top of the 9650 with the top of
the<00:02:29.459> storm<00:02:30.200> is<00:02:31.200> almost<00:02:31.709> the<00:02:31.950> same<00:02:32.780> form<00:02:33.780> factor

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
the storm is almost the same form factor

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:41.800 
the storm is almost the same form factor
and<00:02:36.440> let's<00:02:37.440> compare<00:02:37.860> to<00:02:39.349> firm<00:02:40.349> right<00:02:40.920> here

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
and let's compare to firm right here

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.180 
and let's compare to firm right here
