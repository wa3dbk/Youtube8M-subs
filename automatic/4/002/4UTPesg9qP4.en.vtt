00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:11.840
 everything is interesting I want to go do 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:16.449
 take out 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:24.039
 for easy transportation to his mouth 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:24.039
 you will need the answer 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:59.079
 styrofoam size small 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:12.760
 mark out where to avoid cutting 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.760
 he is already instead 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:29.290
 narrowing is also all that we already had in one 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:34.340
 casey convenient we see how it goes 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:37.240
 be cut out everything up to my future 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.240
 case 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:02:19.410
 muzzle constrictions shop now to the bottom 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:24.400
 our casey 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:26.550
 glue juice such plastic was it 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.550
 same 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:44.520
 even glue and all the glue pulled on such 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.520
 Velvet red fabric and 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:03:01.360
 so i finished unstick the inner 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:08.130
 The basis of his case was about 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:09.340
 so now we proceed to the case itself 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:14.790
 case 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:18.990
 for this, I bought such a fabric 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:22.230
 camouflage sky color and try 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:28.540
 make of her 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:32.860
 the outer outer part of this case is already 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.990
 fully ready to plow from this side 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:38.470
 the inside will be red too 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:42.670
 velvet fabric but here everything is ours 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:46.630
 the lining will be visible by the way between 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:52.690
 lined and 1010 cloth everywhere 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:55.690
 I put in attack material pen foam 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:58.650
 this was to pour over 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:03.930
 tighter my case 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.930
 that 's what we got in the end 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.200
 leave while we will be with me 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:34.770
 tightly inserted into the lock well 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.770
 Now let's see how everything will look 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:47.520
 already the first time and I insert myself interesting 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:57.870
 see for yourself how it will look 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:05:02.410
 the tank could also insert the barrel principle all 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:12.690
 exactly plump like this 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:12.690
 amazing gazina muzzle throat 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:31.849
 and the key principle is all the most necessary 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:31.849
 put the case close 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:51.430
 those cases that have sales that 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:55.129
 looked the most minimal that I found 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:06:00.919
 it's about $ 100 well for quality 

00:05:55.129 --> 00:06:05.509
 he i would say not very good but here 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:10.599
 but materials spent around 10 20 

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:14.930
 dollars well plus of course I sat down and 

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:18.949
 little wife helped sew turned 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:23.080

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:25.789
