00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.290
On December 5th, 2011, the Kepler Science team announced that they had confirmed a planet

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:29.190
roughly the size of ours, in orbit around
a star very similar to the Sun.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.420
What's more, the distance of this planet from its star was perfect.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.480
It wasn't too close, and it wasn't too far away.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.580
If this planet were the Earth, life could live there.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.280
It's name: Kepler-22b.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.460
The parent star, Kepler-22 is very similar to our Sun.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:10.720
Classified as a sun-like G-type star, it is very dim as seen from Earth and measurements of dips in light as the planet

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.060
passes in front are very difficult to make.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.310
Nevertheless, the Kepler Space Telescope first noticed this star as having a planet that

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.590
is possibly like Earth almost immediately.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.660
A mere three days after being declared operationally

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:37.000
ready, Kepler took notice that something was interesting in orbit around this small, dim,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.900
Sun-like star located 600 light years away.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:50.890
Followup observations on the ground and from the Spitzer Space Telescope confirmed the planets existence.

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:01.119
Kepler-22b, the first Earth-sized planet found by Kepler in a habitable zone around another

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:08.220
star, has been confirmed. Of the 54 habitable zone planet candidates currently under scrutiny

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:18.650
by the Kepler Space Telescope, this is the
first  to be confirmed.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.780
Kepler-22b has a radius 2.4 times that of
the Earth, putting this planet in a category

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:33.780
commonly called a super-Earth. It takes 290 days to travel once around around its Sun,

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.080
which is slightly smaller and cooler than
ours.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:45.520
The promise of Kepler-22b, however, is tempered by what we do not know about it.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.080
There is much hidden from us.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.940
The most glaring gap in our knowledge is that we don't know what it's made of.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.780
It could be a rocky planet like Earth, or it could be gaseous and more like Neptune.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:12.620
It may even be covered entirely of water, an ocean planet with an altogether new set of possibilities for life.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:21.720
What we do know is that while Kepler-22b is Earth-like, it is hardly our twin.

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:28.500
At 2.4 times the radius of the Earth, if it is rocky and very dense, then life could be very hard

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:35.500
here. We also do not know if it even contains an atmosphere.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.220
And if it does have an atmosphere, how much heat does the atmosphere trap?

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:48.180
If it traps too much, then Kepler-22b could be more like Venus, a planet known to be very inhospitable to life.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:57.479
If it's a Neptune-like planet, made entirely
of gas, then the chances for life, at least

00:03:57.479 --> 00:04:04.999
as we know it to be, are impossible. Living here, any life would take on a completely unexpected form.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.799
The chances for finding out the answers to many of these questions about Kepler-22b,

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:15.939
while possible, are somewhat remote with our current levels of technology.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:22.240
For example, using radial velocity measurements, a spectral technique that allows us to find out chemical

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.740
compositions of stars, planets and their atmospheres, in addition to the planet itself by measuring

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:33.509
the wobble of the star as the planet circles it, is not feasible for a star so far away

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:36.169
with such a small planet in orbit around it.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.780
Perhaps the biggest promise offered by the confirmation of Kepler-22b isn't the planet itself,

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:56.940
but lies in the fact that it was found so soon after we started looking for planets like the Earth in the first place.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:07.280
With Kepler, the number of Earth-sized candidate planets has increased 200 percent, and the

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:12.649
number of super-Earth candidates has increased 140 percent since February 2011.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.940
This bodes very well indeed for our future search for life in the galaxy.

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:28.219
The discovery of Kepler-22b as an Earth-like planet in a habitable zone is encouraging,

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:33.639
but that by itself offers limited hope in our search for life elsewhere in our galaxy.

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:40.320
So far, all we know is that Kepler-22b is a smallish planet in orbit around a star like

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.050
our Sun at a distance that is very promising.

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:52.720
This planet may be rocky, like the Earth, or it may be gaseous, like Neptune

00:05:53.060 --> 00:06:00.479
but for us to know the true promise of Kepler-22b, we need to keep looking. Keep collecting information

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:02.939
with as many instruments as we can bring to bear.

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:10.300
Because it's what we DON'T know about Kepler-22b that offers us the most promise.
