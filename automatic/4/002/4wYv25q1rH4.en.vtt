00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:13.119 
cut out the root cause of the pausing

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:15.749 
cut out the root cause of the pausing
for<00:01:13.150> you<00:01:13.360> have<00:01:13.479> to<00:01:13.630> cut<00:01:13.960> the<00:01:14.110> root<00:01:14.460> so<00:01:15.460> just

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
for you have to cut the root so just

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:18.240 
for you have to cut the root so just
plucking<00:01:16.090> the<00:01:16.390> leaves<00:01:16.420> it<00:01:16.900> will<00:01:17.049> not<00:01:17.229> cure<00:01:18.130> the
