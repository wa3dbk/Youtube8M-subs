100% and I'm just very happy about it
and<00:00:15.500> now<00:00:16.500> I'll<00:00:16.740> tell<00:00:16.949> you<00:00:17.010> why<00:00:17.279> I<00:00:17.930> will<00:00:18.930> cite<00:00:19.320> if

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
and now I'll tell you why I will cite if

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.359 
and now I'll tell you why I will cite if
I<00:00:19.710> confirm<00:00:20.160> that<00:00:20.460> mu<00:00:20.850> is<00:00:21.710> going<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:23.369> Meg<00:00:23.580> evolve

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:25.369 
I confirm that mu is going to Meg evolve

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.700 
I confirm that mu is going to Meg evolve
so<00:00:26.369> keep<00:00:26.820> that<00:00:26.970> in<00:00:27.029> mind<00:00:27.119> that<00:00:27.539> scientific<00:00:28.289> so

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
so keep that in mind that scientific so

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:29.839 
so keep that in mind that scientific so
let's<00:00:29.310> begin

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
let's begin

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.350 
let's begin
I<00:00:30.170> know<00:00:31.170> mu<00:00:31.679> will<00:00:32.399> be<00:00:32.550> able<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.969> mega<00:00:33.210> evolve

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
I know mu will be able to mega evolve

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.400 
I know mu will be able to mega evolve
because<00:00:33.899> Mewtwo<00:00:34.739> can<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.760> they<00:00:36.239> both<00:00:36.510> knew

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
because Mewtwo can and they both knew

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.670 
because Mewtwo can and they both knew
and<00:00:37.710> you<00:00:38.070> two<00:00:38.309> have<00:00:38.640> the<00:00:38.850> same<00:00:38.879> DNA<00:00:39.440> when<00:00:40.440> you

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
and you two have the same DNA when you

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.450 
and you two have the same DNA when you
two<00:00:40.980> was<00:00:41.640> created<00:00:42.300> she<00:00:42.780> was<00:00:43.050> an<00:00:43.320> exact<00:00:44.010> clone

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
two was created she was an exact clone

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.819 
two was created she was an exact clone
of<00:00:44.640> mu<00:00:44.940> which<00:00:45.510> means<00:00:45.750> they<00:00:45.899> have<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.020> same<00:00:46.110> DNA

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
of mu which means they have the same DNA

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.610 
of mu which means they have the same DNA
now<00:00:47.550> this<00:00:47.789> cloned<00:00:48.149> meal<00:00:48.570> went<00:00:49.410> through

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
now this cloned meal went through

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.290 
now this cloned meal went through
experiments<00:00:51.379> winter<00:00:52.379> experiments<00:00:53.039> and

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
experiments winter experiments and

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.610 
experiments winter experiments and
because<00:00:54.300> of<00:00:54.329> these<00:00:54.539> experiments<00:00:55.460> he

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
because of these experiments he

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.680 
because of these experiments he
developed<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.800> genetic<00:00:59.460> mutation<00:00:59.760> called<00:01:00.510> a

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
developed a genetic mutation called a

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.380 
developed a genetic mutation called a
control<00:01:01.230> gene<00:01:01.590> mutation<00:01:02.219> this<00:01:02.760> mutation

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
control gene mutation this mutation

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.800 
control gene mutation this mutation
forces<00:01:04.229> certain<00:01:05.070> areas<00:01:05.670> of<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.880> DNA<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.330> alter

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
forces certain areas of the DNA to alter

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.010 
forces certain areas of the DNA to alter
slightly<00:01:07.290> through<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.400> logic<00:01:08.790> of<00:01:08.970> change<00:01:09.450> we

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
slightly through the logic of change we

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.469 
slightly through the logic of change we
can<00:01:10.229> conclude<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:10.830> Mewtwo's<00:01:11.790> only

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
can conclude that Mewtwo's only

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.350 
can conclude that Mewtwo's only
alterations<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.470> its<00:01:13.619> DNA<00:01:14.040> resulted<00:01:14.939> in<00:01:15.090> him

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
alterations to its DNA resulted in him

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.160 
alterations to its DNA resulted in him
with<00:01:15.540> both<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:16.140> large<00:01:16.650> more<00:01:17.460> humanoid<00:01:18.420> body<00:01:18.780> and

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
with both a large more humanoid body and

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.570 
with both a large more humanoid body and
a<00:01:19.710> larger<00:01:20.100> brain<00:01:20.450> to<00:01:21.470> have<00:01:22.470> enhanced<00:01:23.159> psychic

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
a larger brain to have enhanced psychic

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.969 
a larger brain to have enhanced psychic
powers<00:01:24.450> because<00:01:25.290> he<00:01:25.470> is<00:01:25.590> already<00:01:25.770> a

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
powers because he is already a

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.359 
powers because he is already a
psychic-type<00:01:26.509> with<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.540> larger<00:01:27.930> brain

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
psychic-type with a larger brain

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:30.560 
psychic-type with a larger brain
obviously<00:01:29.369> psychic<00:01:29.850> powers<00:01:30.270> would<00:01:30.479> be

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
obviously psychic powers would be

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.390 
obviously psychic powers would be
enhanced<00:01:30.869> because<00:01:31.320> it's<00:01:31.740> an<00:01:31.890> intellectual

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
enhanced because it's an intellectual

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.230 
enhanced because it's an intellectual
type<00:01:33.299> related<00:01:34.290> move

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
type related move

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.929 
type related move
nothing<00:01:37.049> else<00:01:37.200> will<00:01:37.320> change<00:01:37.579> but<00:01:38.579> why<00:01:38.759> does

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
nothing else will change but why does

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.870 
nothing else will change but why does
this<00:01:39.030> matter<00:01:39.299> well<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.829> answer<00:01:41.130> lies<00:01:41.159> with

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
this matter well the answer lies with

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.210 
this matter well the answer lies with
them<00:01:42.090> evie<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:43.200> has<00:01:43.470> been<00:01:43.680> confirmed<00:01:44.070> that

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
them evie it has been confirmed that

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.340 
them evie it has been confirmed that
evey<00:01:44.729> can<00:01:45.030> evolve<00:01:45.299> into<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.720> variety<00:01:46.320> of

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
evey can evolve into a variety of

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.609 
evey can evolve into a variety of
Pokemon<00:01:47.220> because<00:01:48.000> Eevee<00:01:48.689> has<00:01:48.930> irregular

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
Pokemon because Eevee has irregular

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:50.649 
Pokemon because Eevee has irregular
genes

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
genes

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:53.480 
genes
this<00:01:51.659> proves<00:01:52.140> that<00:01:52.289> evolutionists<00:01:53.220> cause

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
this proves that evolutionists cause

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.539 
this proves that evolutionists cause
through<00:01:53.820> genetics<00:01:54.360> because<00:01:55.049> if<00:01:55.649> it<00:01:56.070> wasn't

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
through genetics because if it wasn't

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.550 
through genetics because if it wasn't
then<00:01:56.789> irregular<00:01:57.420> genes<00:01:57.750> wouldn't<00:01:58.259> have

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
then irregular genes wouldn't have

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.039 
then irregular genes wouldn't have
effective<00:01:59.280> V's<00:01:59.729> evolutionary<00:02:00.420> line<00:02:00.659> within

effective V's evolutionary line within
the<00:02:01.200> slightest<00:02:01.970> with<00:02:02.970> this<00:02:03.270> in<00:02:03.539> mind<00:02:03.780> I<00:02:04.020> would

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
the slightest with this in mind I would

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.800 
the slightest with this in mind I would
also<00:02:04.500> like<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:04.890> mention<00:02:05.310> that<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.299> Pokemon

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
also like to mention that the Pokemon

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.509 
also like to mention that the Pokemon
X&amp;Y<00:02:07.170> series<00:02:07.799> also<00:02:08.369> gave<00:02:09.560> great<00:02:10.560> information

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
X&amp;Y series also gave great information

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:14.410 
X&amp;Y series also gave great information
on<00:02:12.049> this<00:02:13.049> matter

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
on this matter

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.229 
on this matter
professor<00:02:15.420> Sycamore<00:02:15.630> has<00:02:16.620> been<00:02:17.010> one<00:02:17.459> of<00:02:17.730> the

evolution and evolution work the same as

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:29.780 
evolution and evolution work the same as
proven<00:03:26.639> by<00:03:26.850> Professor<00:03:27.840> Sycamore<00:03:28.500> from<00:03:29.370> the

proven by Professor Sycamore from the

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.780 
proven by Professor Sycamore from the
Pokemon<00:03:30.299> XY<00:03:30.720> series<00:03:31.380> then<00:03:31.980> I<00:03:32.250> can<00:03:32.609> also

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
Pokemon XY series then I can also

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.539 
Pokemon XY series then I can also
conclude<00:03:33.150> that<00:03:33.600> Mewtwo's<00:03:34.560> mega<00:03:34.920> evolution

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:35.549 
conclude that Mewtwo's mega evolution

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.910 
conclude that Mewtwo's mega evolution
occurs<00:03:36.000> within<00:03:36.569> as<00:03:36.810> genetic<00:03:37.290> coding<00:03:37.620> and

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
occurs within as genetic coding and

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.750 
occurs within as genetic coding and
since<00:03:38.670> Jim<00:03:39.359> it<00:03:40.170> since<00:03:40.380> control<00:03:40.859> genetic

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
since Jim it since control genetic

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.020 
since Jim it since control genetic
mutation<00:03:42.329> cannot<00:03:42.690> create<00:03:43.079> new<00:03:43.350> properties

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
mutation cannot create new properties

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.640 
mutation cannot create new properties
but<00:03:45.030> only<00:03:45.239> alter<00:03:45.720> them<00:03:45.930> and

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
but only alter them and

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.429 
but only alter them and
I<00:03:46.680> can<00:03:46.860> conclude<00:03:47.400> that<00:03:47.670> the<00:03:48.000> only<00:03:48.049> way<00:03:49.049> that

00:03:49.429 --> 00:03:49.439 
I can conclude that the only way that

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:52.569 
I can conclude that the only way that
you<00:03:50.010> two<00:03:50.280> could<00:03:50.489> ever<00:03:50.730> mega<00:03:51.239> evolve<00:03:51.780> in

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579 
you two could ever mega evolve in

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:56.839 
you two could ever mega evolve in
existence<00:03:53.579> is<00:03:53.849> if<00:03:54.510> you<00:03:54.870> could<00:03:55.620> already<00:03:55.920> be

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:56.849 
existence is if you could already be

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:00.289 
existence is if you could already be
able<00:03:57.299> to<00:03:57.689> do<00:03:57.870> that<00:03:58.079> on<00:03:58.319> his<00:03:58.349> own<00:03:59.299> that

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
able to do that on his own that

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.420 
able to do that on his own that
statement<00:04:00.870> right<00:04:01.079> there<00:04:01.140> confirms<00:04:01.920> megohm

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
statement right there confirms megohm

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.929 
statement right there confirms megohm
you<00:04:02.670> with<00:04:03.239> 100%<00:04:04.220> justifiable<00:04:05.220> information<00:04:05.849> to

00:04:05.929 --> 00:04:05.939 
you with 100% justifiable information to

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:07.839 
you with 100% justifiable information to
back<00:04:06.150> it<00:04:06.359> up

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:07.849 
back it up

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:12.649 
back it up
so<00:04:08.930> scientifically<00:04:09.930> new<00:04:10.680> can<00:04:11.250> mega<00:04:11.659> mega

00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:12.659 
so scientifically new can mega mega

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:16.069 
so scientifically new can mega mega
evolve<00:04:13.140> for<00:04:13.829> a<00:04:13.890> fact<00:04:14.220> even<00:04:14.970> if<00:04:15.390> Game<00:04:15.750> Freak

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
evolve for a fact even if Game Freak

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.390 
evolve for a fact even if Game Freak
never<00:04:17.570> has<00:04:18.570> the<00:04:18.780> intention<00:04:19.139> to<00:04:19.709> implement<00:04:19.889> it

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
never has the intention to implement it

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.710 
never has the intention to implement it
but<00:04:21.389> I<00:04:21.630> am<00:04:21.959> 100%<00:04:23.120> confident<00:04:24.120> that<00:04:24.240> they<00:04:24.510> will

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
but I am 100% confident that they will

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.750 
but I am 100% confident that they will
implement<00:04:25.139> megohm<00:04:25.680> you<00:04:25.830> into<00:04:26.220> the<00:04:26.310> Pokemon

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
implement megohm you into the Pokemon

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.250 
implement megohm you into the Pokemon
games<00:04:26.990> because<00:04:27.990> they<00:04:28.650> wouldn't<00:04:29.220> take<00:04:29.970> a<00:04:30.300> true

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
games because they wouldn't take a true

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:34.159 
games because they wouldn't take a true
through<00:04:32.160> scientific<00:04:32.940> fact<00:04:33.419> that<00:04:33.690> has<00:04:33.840> been

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:34.169 
through scientific fact that has been

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:38.029 
through scientific fact that has been
completely<00:04:35.100> proven<00:04:35.880> and<00:04:36.289> just<00:04:37.289> keep<00:04:37.650> the

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
answer in visuals and like in game

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.700 
answer in visuals and like in game
effects<00:04:42.000> video<00:04:42.720> they<00:04:43.050> wouldn't<00:04:43.349> keep<00:04:43.440> it<00:04:43.590> a

mystery<00:04:44.070> basically<00:04:44.580> they<00:04:44.910> like<00:04:45.120> to<00:04:45.300> have

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
mystery basically they like to have

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.670 
mystery basically they like to have
people<00:04:46.110> being<00:04:46.740> able<00:04:46.979> to<00:04:47.130> see<00:04:47.580> and<00:04:47.880> use<00:04:48.680> the

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
actual things within the game they don't

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.900 
actual things within the game they don't
they<00:04:51.990> don't<00:04:52.020> like<00:04:52.530> they<00:04:53.160> don't<00:04:53.340> want<00:04:53.520> people

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
they don't like they don't want people

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:57.529 
they don't like they don't want people
to<00:04:54.770> know<00:04:55.770> something<00:04:56.310> exists<00:04:56.910> and<00:04:57.090> not<00:04:57.240> be<00:04:57.389> able

to know what it is or how it looks like
that<00:05:00.960> is<00:05:01.229> just<00:05:01.770> downright<00:05:02.340> wrong<00:05:02.970> for<00:05:03.330> Game

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479
