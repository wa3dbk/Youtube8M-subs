00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:38.190 
she's pretty much kill you but a female
version<00:03:37.239> of<00:03:37.299> it<00:03:37.419> made<00:03:37.569> a<00:03:37.599> little<00:03:37.810> bit<00:03:37.989> more

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
version of it made a little bit more

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.430 
version of it made a little bit more
strict<00:03:38.950> I<00:03:39.190> guess<00:03:39.579> or<00:03:39.790> not<00:03:40.000> no<00:03:40.239> although<00:03:41.169> she's

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
strict I guess or not no although she's

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.890 
strict I guess or not no although she's
not<00:03:41.470> as<00:03:41.919> bad<00:03:42.340> as<00:03:42.370> Kyoya<00:03:43.090> was<00:03:43.299> in<00:03:43.690> the<00:03:43.780> beginning

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
not as bad as Kyoya was in the beginning

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.750 
not as bad as Kyoya was in the beginning
parts<00:03:44.620> of<00:03:44.739> the<00:03:44.799> episode<00:03:45.160> she<00:03:45.280> wasn't<00:03:45.549> as<00:03:45.609> bad

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
parts of the episode she wasn't as bad

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.819 
parts of the episode she wasn't as bad
maybe<00:03:46.000> it's<00:03:46.209> because<00:03:46.329> erica<00:03:46.930> is<00:03:47.079> you<00:03:47.379> know<00:03:47.530> a

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:47.829 
maybe it's because erica is you know a

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:50.490 
maybe it's because erica is you know a
female<00:03:48.459> maybe<00:03:49.299> that's<00:03:49.540> the<00:03:49.629> reason<00:03:49.780> why<00:03:49.930> my

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
female maybe that's the reason why my

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.080 
female maybe that's the reason why my
impressions<00:03:51.069> of<00:03:51.129> her<00:03:51.250> slightly<00:03:51.609> different

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
impressions of her slightly different

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.089 
impressions of her slightly different
compared<00:03:52.299> the<00:03:52.449> first<00:03:52.690> time<00:03:52.900> I<00:03:52.930> saw<00:03:53.650> kill<00:03:53.949> you

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:54.099 
compared the first time I saw kill you

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:56.280 
compared the first time I saw kill you
in<00:03:54.190> the<00:03:54.220> series<00:03:54.609> because<00:03:55.180> technically<00:03:55.599> we

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
in the series because technically we

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.020 
in the series because technically we
didn't<00:03:56.560> see<00:03:56.709> her<00:03:56.859> really<00:03:57.099> interact<00:03:57.549> a<00:03:57.730> lot

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
didn't see her really interact a lot

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:00.000 
didn't see her really interact a lot
with<00:03:58.090> around<00:03:58.569> male<00:03:58.810> characters<00:03:59.349> besides<00:03:59.739> the

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
with around male characters besides the

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.000 
with around male characters besides the
fodder<00:04:00.310> characters<00:04:00.879> of<00:04:01.030> the<00:04:01.120> series<00:04:01.299> so<00:04:02.010> I'm

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
fodder characters of the series so I'm

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.420 
fodder characters of the series so I'm
guessing<00:04:03.340> my<00:04:03.879> impressions<00:04:04.660> of<00:04:05.040> Kyoya<00:04:06.040> sister

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:06.430 
guessing my impressions of Kyoya sister

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.159 
guessing my impressions of Kyoya sister
probably<00:04:06.760> be<00:04:06.819> the<00:04:06.940> same<00:04:07.150> as<00:04:07.329> how<00:04:07.449> it<00:04:07.599> was<00:04:07.629> for

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:08.169 
probably be the same as how it was for

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:10.830 
probably be the same as how it was for
Kyoya<00:04:09.150> I'm<00:04:10.150> guess<00:04:10.389> that's<00:04:10.599> how<00:04:10.690> my

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
Kyoya I'm guess that's how my

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.659 
Kyoya I'm guess that's how my
impressions<00:04:11.260> are<00:04:11.470> but<00:04:11.949> the<00:04:12.069> sister<00:04:12.430> seems

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:12.669 
impressions are but the sister seems

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:14.610 
impressions are but the sister seems
really<00:04:12.910> nice<00:04:13.030> I<00:04:13.299> like<00:04:13.720> it<00:04:13.930> I<00:04:14.019> like<00:04:14.079> how<00:04:14.590> she

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
really nice I like it I like how she

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.199 
really nice I like it I like how she
actually<00:04:15.040> does<00:04:15.340> kind<00:04:15.579> of<00:04:15.639> look<00:04:15.760> out<00:04:15.910> for<00:04:16.090> her

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
actually does kind of look out for her

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.240 
actually does kind of look out for her
brother<00:04:16.419> even<00:04:16.660> though<00:04:16.750> at<00:04:17.349> first<00:04:17.410> glance<00:04:18.010> it

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
brother even though at first glance it

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:19.140 
brother even though at first glance it
looks<00:04:18.370> like<00:04:18.489> she<00:04:18.579> doesn't<00:04:18.849> care<00:04:18.880> for<00:04:19.000> a

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
looks like she doesn't care for a

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.640 
looks like she doesn't care for a
brother<00:04:19.389> you<00:04:19.810> could<00:04:19.959> tell<00:04:20.079> she<00:04:20.260> really<00:04:20.289> does

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
brother you could tell she really does

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:23.279 
brother you could tell she really does
in<00:04:21.010> the<00:04:21.159> way<00:04:21.310> she<00:04:21.340> was<00:04:21.669> kind<00:04:21.909> of<00:04:22.030> testing<00:04:22.810> erica

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:23.289 
in the way she was kind of testing erica

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:24.990 
in the way she was kind of testing erica
in<00:04:23.440> this<00:04:23.620> even<00:04:23.830> though<00:04:23.950> Erica<00:04:24.280> kinda<00:04:24.640> wasn't

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
in this even though Erica kinda wasn't

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.760 
in this even though Erica kinda wasn't
aware<00:04:25.210> of<00:04:25.270> it<00:04:25.479> was<00:04:25.960> pretty<00:04:26.200> interesting
