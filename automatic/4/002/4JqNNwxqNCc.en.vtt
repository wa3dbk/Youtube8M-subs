00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:53.630
 Our concern is to make a 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:57.380
 lemon juice and a city ​​where you have 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:03:00.739
 lots of sun and then catch a beach 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:04.970
 really will get a very burn 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:07.549
 big on the hand then the worry is the 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:11.110

 they will put a little lemon with river 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.730
 southern 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:34.690
 the lining pays completely covert 

00:04:38.609 --> 00:04:46.829
 Look what you smell and stay in the studio. 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:56.249

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.860
 remove the chicken 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:15.940
 and then we'll do the following 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.940
 little lemon 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:34.590
 the boys are a very nice dish 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:38.169

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.990
 lemon and chicken is also a meat that 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:52.680
 receives very well thus 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.680
