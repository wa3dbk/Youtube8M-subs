the inner corner and that's it and if

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.500 
the inner corner and that's it and if
you<00:02:20.200> want<00:02:20.380> to<00:02:20.530> smudge<00:02:20.860> it<00:02:21.069> and<00:02:21.580> just<00:02:21.910> take<00:02:22.209> a

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
you want to smudge it and just take a

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:29.790 
you want to smudge it and just take a
cotton<00:02:23.319> bud<00:02:26.610> like<00:02:27.610> this<00:02:27.819> and<00:02:28.180> just<00:02:28.740> drag<00:02:29.740> it

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
cotton bud like this and just drag it

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.250 
cotton bud like this and just drag it
along<00:02:30.040> the<00:02:30.220> line<00:02:30.520> just<00:02:30.820> to<00:02:30.970> soften<00:02:31.690> that<00:02:32.020> line

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
along the line just to soften that line

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.810 
along the line just to soften that line
a<00:02:32.290> wee<00:02:32.500> bit<00:02:32.680> because<00:02:32.890> sometimes<00:02:33.400> it'll<00:02:33.610> be<00:02:33.790> a

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
a wee bit because sometimes it'll be a

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:41.640 
a wee bit because sometimes it'll be a
bit<00:02:34.320> harsh<00:02:37.530> so<00:02:38.530> just<00:02:38.770> soften<00:02:39.190> it<00:02:40.470> and<00:02:41.470> that's

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
bit harsh so just soften it and that's

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.860 
bit harsh so just soften it and that's
it<00:02:41.800> and<00:02:41.860> then<00:02:42.069> just<00:02:42.280> do<00:02:42.459> the<00:02:42.580> same<00:02:42.760> again<00:02:43.060> with

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
it and then just do the same again with

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.010 
it and then just do the same again with
the<00:02:44.050> other<00:02:44.080> I<00:02:44.970> night<00:02:45.970> this<00:02:46.480> can<00:02:46.720> be<00:02:46.750> awkward

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
the other I night this can be awkward

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.340 
the other I night this can be awkward
for<00:02:47.260> some<00:02:47.800> people<00:02:48.720> because<00:02:49.720> it<00:02:49.959> means<00:02:50.110> working

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
for some people because it means working

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.970 
for some people because it means working
across<00:02:51.750> your<00:02:52.750> face<00:02:52.989> like<00:02:53.380> that<00:02:53.590> and<00:02:53.830> what<00:02:53.950> I

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
across your face like that and what I

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.030 
across your face like that and what I
tend<00:02:54.400> today<00:02:54.640> is<00:02:54.970> use<00:02:55.840> my<00:02:56.080> right<00:02:56.320> hand<00:02:56.380> from<00:02:56.920> my

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
tend today is use my right hand from my

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.979 
tend today is use my right hand from my
right<00:02:57.250> eye<00:02:57.280> on<00:02:57.760> my<00:02:57.910> left<00:02:58.209> hand<00:02:58.480> from<00:02:58.690> my<00:02:58.810> left

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
right eye on my left hand from my left

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.140 
right eye on my left hand from my left
eye<00:02:59.290> and<00:02:59.560> that's<00:02:59.950> also<00:03:00.160> awkward<00:03:00.519> for<00:03:00.880> people

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
eye and that's also awkward for people

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.850 
eye and that's also awkward for people
so<00:03:01.380> whatever<00:03:02.380> you're<00:03:02.560> comfortable<00:03:02.890> with<00:03:04.860> so

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
so whatever you're comfortable with so

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
middle and go down to the outer corner

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.390 
middle and go down to the outer corner
and<00:03:14.050> then<00:03:14.200> start<00:03:14.560> at<00:03:14.650> the<00:03:14.769> outer<00:03:14.890> corner<00:03:15.010> and

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
come up to make that line and then just

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.449 
come up to make that line and then just
work<00:03:19.930> my<00:03:20.140> mind<00:03:20.560> to<00:03:21.190> the<00:03:21.310> inner<00:03:21.489> corner<00:03:23.310> you<00:03:24.310> can

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
work my mind to the inner corner you can

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:27.240 
work my mind to the inner corner you can
just<00:03:24.670> hit<00:03:24.820> a<00:03:24.970> little<00:03:25.209> small<00:03:25.480> strokes<00:03:26.220> join<00:03:27.220> a

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
just hit a little small strokes join a

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:34.440 
just hit a little small strokes join a
neat<00:03:27.519> little<00:03:27.940> line<00:03:28.299> together<00:03:32.549> and<00:03:33.549> try<00:03:34.209> not<00:03:34.390> to

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
neat little line together and try not to

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:40.460 
neat little line together and try not to
blink<00:03:36.690> easier<00:03:37.690> said<00:03:38.019> than<00:03:38.200> done<00:03:38.260> I<00:03:38.620> know<00:03:38.680> I

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
blink easier said than done I know I

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.140 
blink easier said than done I know I
left<00:03:41.470> I<00:03:41.680> tends<00:03:41.950> to<00:03:42.130> blank<00:03:42.340> a<00:03:42.430> bit<00:03:42.579> more<00:03:42.790> than

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
left I tends to blank a bit more than

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.030 
left I tends to blank a bit more than
the<00:03:43.420> right<00:03:43.600> eye<00:03:43.630> and<00:03:46.200> then<00:03:47.200> again<00:03:47.530> to<00:03:47.709> see<00:03:47.890> your

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
little squiggles and between your lashes

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:54.949 
little squiggles and between your lashes
to<00:03:51.940> try<00:03:52.120> and<00:03:52.239> get<00:03:52.329> as<00:03:52.570> close<00:03:52.720> as<00:03:53.140> possible<00:03:53.230> to

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
to try and get as close as possible to

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.259 
to try and get as close as possible to
the<00:03:55.959> lash<00:03:56.260> line<00:03:56.560> and<00:03:56.799> then<00:03:57.730> if<00:03:57.880> you<00:03:57.970> want<00:03:58.150> to

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
the lash line and then if you want to

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:01.470 
the lash line and then if you want to
apply<00:03:58.420> to<00:03:58.510> your<00:03:58.959> waterline<00:04:00.180> just<00:04:01.180> go<00:04:01.360> ahead

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
apply to your waterline just go ahead

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.960 
apply to your waterline just go ahead
and<00:04:01.690> do<00:04:01.989> it<00:04:02.110> again<00:04:02.290> people<00:04:02.890> pull<00:04:03.640> their<00:04:03.820> eyes

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
and do it again people pull their eyes

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.600 
and do it again people pull their eyes
down<00:04:04.329> like<00:04:04.570> that<00:04:04.750> I<00:04:04.959> don't<00:04:05.250> I'm<00:04:06.250> really

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
down like that I don't I'm really

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.789 
down like that I don't I'm really
against<00:04:07.180> all<00:04:07.420> that<00:04:07.600> stretch<00:04:08.079> in<00:04:08.109> business

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 
against all that stretch in business

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:11.970 
against all that stretch in business
because<00:04:09.510> it's<00:04:10.510> just<00:04:10.720> gonna<00:04:10.900> add<00:04:11.260> the<00:04:11.290> wrinkles

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
because it's just gonna add the wrinkles

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.170 
because it's just gonna add the wrinkles
encourage<00:04:12.579> them<00:04:12.790> to<00:04:12.820> appear<00:04:13.299> so<00:04:14.549> all<00:04:15.549> I<00:04:15.730> do<00:04:15.790> is

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
encourage them to appear so all I do is

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:23.809 
encourage them to appear so all I do is
just<00:04:16.630> hook<00:04:17.560> up<00:04:17.739> slightly<00:04:19.709> and<00:04:20.709> start<00:04:21.039> drawing

00:04:23.809 --> 00:04:23.819 

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:26.070 

you<00:04:24.819> can<00:04:24.940> go<00:04:25.060> right<00:04:25.300> the<00:04:25.599> right<00:04:25.690> under<00:04:25.990> the

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
you can go right the right under the

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.870 
you can go right the right under the
inner<00:04:26.259> corner<00:04:26.740> if<00:04:27.130> you<00:04:27.310> want<00:04:27.520> but<00:04:27.669> that's

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
inner corner if you want but that's

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.020 
inner corner if you want but that's
going<00:04:28.120> to<00:04:28.210> really<00:04:28.360> close<00:04:28.750> your<00:04:29.020> eye<00:04:29.050> up<00:04:30.000> so<00:04:31.000> I

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
going to really close your eye up so I

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:37.080 
going to really close your eye up so I
tend<00:04:31.360> to<00:04:31.449> just<00:04:31.539> kind<00:04:31.900> of<00:04:31.960> stopped<00:04:34.830> just<00:04:36.090> let's

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
tend to just kind of stopped just let's

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.110 
tend to just kind of stopped just let's
just<00:04:37.300> about<00:04:37.990> where<00:04:38.169> the<00:04:38.289> eyelashes<00:04:39.120> stop

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
just about where the eyelashes stop

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.790 
just about where the eyelashes stop
growing<00:04:42.660> so<00:04:43.660> there<00:04:43.780> you<00:04:43.900> go<00:04:43.930> and<00:04:44.289> the<00:04:44.590> same

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
growing so there you go and the same

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.320 
growing so there you go and the same
again<00:04:45.069> on<00:04:45.190> the<00:04:45.280> other<00:04:45.310> eye<00:04:45.520> again<00:04:46.030> I<00:04:46.060> would

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
again on the other eye again I would

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:57.679 
again on the other eye again I would
just<00:04:46.569> switch<00:04:47.020> hands<00:04:47.440> but<00:04:47.979> it's<00:04:48.099> up<00:04:48.250> to<00:04:48.280> you

00:04:57.679 --> 00:04:57.689 

00:04:57.689 --> 00:05:04.190 

and<00:04:58.289> just<00:04:58.529> start<00:04:58.799> drawing

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:04.200 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.530 

you<00:05:04.800> can<00:05:04.980> let<00:05:05.130> that<00:05:05.160> line<00:05:05.580> dry<00:05:05.910> and<00:05:06.210> then<00:05:06.360> you

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540
