00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.350 
problem and the carburetor so first
things<00:00:11.130> first<00:00:11.190> I'm<00:00:11.700> going<00:00:11.849> to<00:00:11.940> remove<00:00:12.150> the

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
things first I'm going to remove the

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.570 
things first I'm going to remove the
engine<00:00:12.540> cover<00:00:12.840> so<00:00:13.650> I<00:00:13.679> can<00:00:13.889> start<00:00:14.130> sanding<00:00:14.429> that

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
engine cover so I can start sanding that

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.330 
engine cover so I can start sanding that
down<00:00:14.969> to<00:00:15.330> repaint<00:00:15.780> while<00:00:16.740> I<00:00:16.770> wait<00:00:17.100> for<00:00:17.250> the

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
down to repaint while I wait for the

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:24.290 
down to repaint while I wait for the
parts<00:00:17.640> to<00:00:17.760> come<00:00:17.940> with<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.390> postman<00:00:23.300> so

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
parts to come with the postman so

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.820 
parts to come with the postman so
basically<00:00:24.689> what<00:00:25.019> I'm<00:00:25.080> going<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.260> do<00:00:25.410> is<00:00:25.650> just

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
basically what I'm going to do is just

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.160 
basically what I'm going to do is just
use<00:00:26.010> some<00:00:26.220> fine<00:00:26.490> wet<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:26.880> dry<00:00:27.029> paper<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.660> just

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
use some fine wet and dry paper and just

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.679 
use some fine wet and dry paper and just
take<00:00:28.439> off<00:00:28.619> that<00:00:28.769> surface<00:00:29.220> rust<00:00:29.460> this<00:00:30.330> is<00:00:30.390> just

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
take off that surface rust this is just

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.840 
take off that surface rust this is just
to<00:00:30.810> get<00:00:30.960> rid<00:00:31.109> of<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.260> rough<00:00:31.470> effect<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.070> also

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
to get rid of the rough effect and also

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.430 
to get rid of the rough effect and also
to<00:00:32.910> prevent<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.480> rust<00:00:33.660> in<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.899> future<00:00:34.230> and

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
to prevent the rust in the future and

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.880 
to prevent the rust in the future and
really<00:00:35.430> when<00:00:36.149> you<00:00:36.180> do<00:00:36.420> this<00:00:36.630> it's<00:00:37.290> basically

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
really when you do this it's basically

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.369 
really when you do this it's basically
just<00:00:38.520> taking<00:00:38.910> off<00:00:39.030> that<00:00:39.210> rust<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:40.079> you<00:00:40.230> can

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
just taking off that rust and it you can

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.720 
just taking off that rust and it you can
see<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.590> paint<00:00:40.800> underneath<00:00:41.129> it<00:00:41.399> doesn't<00:00:41.610> even

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
see the paint underneath it doesn't even

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.760 
see the paint underneath it doesn't even
look<00:00:41.879> rusty<00:00:42.360> once<00:00:42.510> you've<00:00:42.660> done<00:00:42.780> this<00:00:42.960> but

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
look rusty once you've done this but

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.040 
look rusty once you've done this but
just<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.250> make<00:00:44.340> it<00:00:44.399> look<00:00:44.520> smart<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.149> obviously

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
just to make it look smart and obviously

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.139 
just to make it look smart and obviously
a<00:00:46.489> restoration<00:00:47.489> isn't<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.789> complete

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
a restoration isn't a complete

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.639 
a restoration isn't a complete
restoration<00:00:48.480> if<00:00:48.809> you<00:00:48.899> don't<00:00:49.050> paint<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.500> I'm

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
restoration if you don't paint it I'm

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.369 
restoration if you don't paint it I'm
going<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.430> be<00:00:50.579> painting<00:00:51.000> it<00:00:51.239> in<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.989> cream

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
going to be painting it in the cream

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.819 
going to be painting it in the cream
color<00:00:52.739> as<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.460> originally<00:00:53.730> was<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.500> the<00:00:55.500> top

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
color as it originally was and the top

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.010 
color as it originally was and the top
cover<00:00:56.070> won't<00:00:56.340> be<00:00:56.550> heatwave<00:00:56.969> paint<00:00:57.239> but<00:00:57.809> all

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
cover won't be heatwave paint but all

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.560 
cover won't be heatwave paint but all
the<00:00:58.350> parts<00:00:58.590> which<00:00:58.829> get<00:00:59.039> very<00:00:59.280> hot<00:00:59.520> will<00:01:00.210> be<00:01:00.390> in

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
the parts which get very hot will be in

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.509 
the parts which get very hot will be in
high-temperature<00:01:01.079> paint<00:01:03.470> so<00:01:04.470> this<00:01:05.220> is<00:01:05.369> it

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
high-temperature paint so this is it

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.660 
high-temperature paint so this is it
sanded<00:01:05.909> down<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.390> ready<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.350> be<00:01:07.560> painted<00:01:07.979> you

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
sanded down and ready to be painted you

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.789 
sanded down and ready to be painted you
can<00:01:08.820> see<00:01:09.030> I've<00:01:09.270> put<00:01:09.299> masking<00:01:09.930> tape<00:01:10.170> around<00:01:10.619> all

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
can see I've put masking tape around all

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.219 
can see I've put masking tape around all
the<00:01:10.890> stickers<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:12.119> they<00:01:12.479> don't<00:01:12.689> get<00:01:12.810> covered

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
the stickers so they don't get covered

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.460 
the stickers so they don't get covered
in<00:01:13.439> paint<00:01:13.710> when<00:01:13.979> I'm<00:01:14.070> spraying<00:01:14.369> it<00:01:18.320> so<00:01:19.320> now

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
in paint when I'm spraying it so now

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.380 
in paint when I'm spraying it so now
it's<00:01:19.619> time<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.920> paint<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:21.210> way<00:01:21.330> I'm

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
it's time to paint it and the way I'm

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.179 
it's time to paint it and the way I'm
going<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.600> do<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:21.900> is<00:01:22.049> two<00:01:22.439> separate<00:01:22.950> layers

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
going to do it is two separate layers

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.340 
going to do it is two separate layers
first<00:01:24.060> layer<00:01:24.360> will<00:01:24.720> be<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.869> thin<00:01:25.140> layer

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
first layer will be a thin layer

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.800 
first layer will be a thin layer
followed<00:01:26.340> by<00:01:26.640> another<00:01:26.939> thin<00:01:27.240> layer<00:01:27.270> which

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
followed by another thin layer which

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.170 
followed by another thin layer which
will<00:01:27.960> be<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.140> final<00:01:28.500> coat<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:29.009> this<00:01:29.729> way<00:01:29.939> it

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
will be the final coat and this way it

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.929 
will be the final coat and this way it
should<00:01:30.420> prevent<00:01:30.750> any<00:01:30.930> runs<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.799> it<00:01:32.700> should

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
should prevent any runs and it should

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.760 
should prevent any runs and it should
also<00:01:33.090> make<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:33.420> thicker<00:01:33.869> coat<00:01:34.200> in<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.470> end<00:01:34.590> as

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
also make a thicker coat in the end as

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.200 
also make a thicker coat in the end as
well<00:01:35.119> so<00:01:36.119> this<00:01:36.720> is<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.020> first<00:01:37.290> coat<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:38.280> I'm

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
well so this is the first coat and I'm

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.109 
well so this is the first coat and I'm
putting<00:01:39.570> it<00:01:39.659> on<00:01:39.689> fairly<00:01:40.140> thinly<00:01:40.880> just<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:41.970> make

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
putting it on fairly thinly just to make

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:52.020 
putting it on fairly thinly just to make
sure<00:01:42.150> I<00:01:42.360> don't<00:01:42.570> get<00:01:42.840> any<00:01:42.899> runs

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.370 

right<00:01:53.030> so<00:01:53.210> that's<00:01:53.299> the<00:01:53.479> engine<00:01:53.719> cover<00:01:53.929> painted

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
right so that's the engine cover painted

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.620 
right so that's the engine cover painted
I've<00:01:54.500> done<00:01:54.649> both<00:01:54.799> layers<00:01:55.369> now<00:01:55.640> and<00:01:55.880> I've<00:01:56.479> taken

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
I've done both layers now and I've taken

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.020 
I've done both layers now and I've taken
the<00:01:56.869> masking<00:01:57.200> tape<00:01:57.229> off<00:01:57.560> and<00:01:57.829> this<00:01:58.700> is<00:01:58.850> pretty

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
the masking tape off and this is pretty

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.639 
the masking tape off and this is pretty
much<00:01:59.119> what<00:01:59.359> it's<00:01:59.450> going<00:01:59.570> to<00:01:59.630> look<00:01:59.689> like<00:01:59.899> a<00:02:00.170> bit

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
much what it's going to look like a bit

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:02.529 
much what it's going to look like a bit
of<00:02:00.740> paint<00:02:00.979> has<00:02:01.250> gone<00:02:01.520> underneath<00:02:01.909> the<00:02:02.179> masking

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:02.539 
of paint has gone underneath the masking

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:04.779 
of paint has gone underneath the masking
tape<00:02:02.569> and<00:02:02.960> gone<00:02:03.259> on<00:02:03.350> the<00:02:03.469> stickers<00:02:03.829> but<00:02:04.159> a<00:02:04.369> bit

00:02:04.779 --> 00:02:04.789 
tape and gone on the stickers but a bit

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:06.969 
tape and gone on the stickers but a bit
of<00:02:04.880> white<00:02:05.000> spirit<00:02:05.329> should<00:02:05.450> get<00:02:05.630> that<00:02:05.810> off<00:02:05.979> so

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
of white spirit should get that off so

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:08.889 
of white spirit should get that off so
the<00:02:07.069> parts<00:02:07.340> have<00:02:07.460> now<00:02:07.579> come<00:02:07.850> and<00:02:08.030> you<00:02:08.599> can<00:02:08.720> see

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
the parts have now come and you can see

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.389 
the parts have now come and you can see
I've<00:02:08.989> got<00:02:09.140> a<00:02:09.200> new<00:02:09.410> fuel<00:02:09.709> cap<00:02:09.920> through<00:02:10.250> the

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
I've got a new fuel cap through the

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.550 
I've got a new fuel cap through the
proper<00:02:10.819> one<00:02:10.970> the<00:02:11.510> metal<00:02:11.870> one<00:02:12.019> which<00:02:12.200> sees<00:02:12.379> all

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
proper one the metal one which sees all

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.199 
proper one the metal one which sees all
the<00:02:12.709> ones<00:02:12.890> had<00:02:13.129> rather<00:02:13.519> than<00:02:13.760> the<00:02:13.849> plastic

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
the ones had rather than the plastic

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:18.070 
the ones had rather than the plastic
ones<00:02:14.390> and<00:02:15.940> then<00:02:16.940> I've<00:02:17.060> got<00:02:17.299> this<00:02:17.510> spring<00:02:17.900> for

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
ones and then I've got this spring for

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.990 
ones and then I've got this spring for
the<00:02:18.140> diaphragm<00:02:18.560> now<00:02:18.920> this<00:02:19.099> may<00:02:19.459> well<00:02:19.640> not<00:02:19.849> be

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
the diaphragm now this may well not be

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.050 
the diaphragm now this may well not be
the<00:02:20.090> correct<00:02:20.209> one<00:02:20.650> but<00:02:21.650> it's<00:02:21.769> a<00:02:21.830> gamble<00:02:22.010> as<00:02:22.730> far

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
the correct one but it's a gamble as far

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.430 
the correct one but it's a gamble as far
as<00:02:23.120> I'm<00:02:23.209> aware<00:02:23.420> the<00:02:23.690> proper<00:02:24.019> spring<00:02:24.290> is

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
as I'm aware the proper spring is

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.420 
as I'm aware the proper spring is
obsolete<00:02:25.180> so<00:02:26.180> I've<00:02:26.269> had<00:02:26.420> to<00:02:26.450> get<00:02:26.690> this<00:02:26.780> one<00:02:26.840> and

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
obsolete so I've had to get this one and

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.740 
obsolete so I've had to get this one and
hopefully<00:02:28.430> fingers<00:02:28.910> crossed<00:02:29.060> it's<00:02:29.569> going<00:02:29.690> to

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
hopefully fingers crossed it's going to

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.559 
hopefully fingers crossed it's going to
work<00:02:29.930> and<00:02:30.489> finally<00:02:31.489> a<00:02:31.670> spacer<00:02:32.060> for<00:02:32.329> the<00:02:32.420> fuel

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
work and finally a spacer for the fuel

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.080 
work and finally a spacer for the fuel
tank<00:02:32.840> and<00:02:33.019> that<00:02:33.130> is<00:02:34.130> for<00:02:34.370> the<00:02:34.519> bolt<00:02:34.730> which

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
tank and that is for the bolt which

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.430 
tank and that is for the bolt which
attaches<00:02:35.599> the<00:02:35.690> fuel<00:02:35.900> tank<00:02:36.170> to<00:02:36.379> the<00:02:36.530> crankcase

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.470 

right<00:02:41.130> the<00:02:41.370> muffler<00:02:41.700> now<00:02:41.850> that's<00:02:42.210> going<00:02:42.360> to<00:02:42.420> be

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
right the muffler now that's going to be

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.880 
right the muffler now that's going to be
done<00:02:42.660> in<00:02:42.870> a<00:02:42.960> high<00:02:43.200> temperature

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
done in a high temperature

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.910 
done in a high temperature
that's<00:02:44.430> manifold<00:02:45.030> and<00:02:45.210> exhaust<00:02:45.540> paint<00:02:45.920> and

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
that's manifold and exhaust paint and

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.130 
that's manifold and exhaust paint and
it's<00:02:47.250> going<00:02:47.340> to<00:02:47.430> be<00:02:47.490> so<00:02:47.700> obviously<00:02:48.300> and<00:02:48.990> you

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
it's going to be so obviously and you

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.110 
it's going to be so obviously and you
can<00:02:49.290> see<00:02:49.470> I've<00:02:49.680> given<00:02:50.250> it<00:02:50.430> a<00:02:50.460> quick<00:02:50.610> sundown

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
can see I've given it a quick sundown

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.450 
can see I've given it a quick sundown
and<00:02:51.330> then<00:02:51.720> a<00:02:51.960> quick<00:02:52.350> layer<00:02:52.590> of<00:02:52.770> that<00:02:52.920> paint<00:02:53.220> and

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
and then a quick layer of that paint and

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:54.980 
and then a quick layer of that paint and
it<00:02:53.730> pretty<00:02:54.090> much<00:02:54.270> makes<00:02:54.480> it<00:02:54.660> look<00:02:54.810> new<00:02:54.960> again

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
it pretty much makes it look new again

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.740 
it pretty much makes it look new again
so<00:02:55.920> that's<00:02:56.400> a<00:02:56.550> really<00:02:57.000> really<00:02:57.030> good<00:02:57.540> thing<00:02:57.720> to

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
so that's a really really good thing to

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.380 
so that's a really really good thing to
do<00:02:57.990> even<00:02:58.440> to<00:02:58.860> your<00:02:59.040> engine<00:02:59.400> if<00:02:59.550> you've<00:03:00.030> got<00:03:00.240> one

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
do even to your engine if you've got one

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.620 
do even to your engine if you've got one
and<00:03:00.630> all<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:02.130> suits<00:03:02.670> gone<00:03:02.910> round<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.270> exhaust

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
and all the suits gone round the exhaust

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.450 
and all the suits gone round the exhaust
it<00:03:03.840> starts<00:03:04.140> to<00:03:04.230> go<00:03:04.320> rusty<00:03:04.530> just<00:03:05.190> give<00:03:05.340> it<00:03:05.430> a

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460 
it starts to go rusty just give it a

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:06.650 
it starts to go rusty just give it a
quick<00:03:05.580> sundown<00:03:06.000> put<00:03:06.240> some<00:03:06.360> high-temperature

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
quick sundown put some high-temperature

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:14.280 
quick sundown put some high-temperature
paint<00:03:07.050> on<00:03:07.170> it<00:03:07.260> it<00:03:07.650> makes<00:03:07.770> it<00:03:07.980> look<00:03:08.130> all<00:03:08.340> better

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.259 

so<00:03:14.920> now<00:03:15.040> I'm<00:03:15.129> removing<00:03:15.370> the<00:03:15.580> fuel<00:03:15.730> tank<00:03:16.030> ready

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
so now I'm removing the fuel tank ready

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:18.449 
so now I'm removing the fuel tank ready
to<00:03:16.450> spray<00:03:16.840> and<00:03:17.110> also<00:03:17.920> to<00:03:17.980> work<00:03:18.189> on<00:03:18.340> the

to spray and also to work on the
carburetor<00:03:18.909> I<00:03:19.209> need<00:03:19.720> to<00:03:19.810> put<00:03:19.959> the<00:03:20.079> spring<00:03:20.500> in

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
carburetor I need to put the spring in

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.920 
carburetor I need to put the spring in
there<00:03:20.829> and<00:03:21.069> like<00:03:21.909> I<00:03:21.939> say<00:03:22.150> fingers<00:03:22.599> crossed

will<00:03:41.799> be<00:03:41.920> my<00:03:42.129> painting<00:03:42.640> fuel<00:03:42.940> cap<00:03:43.180> for<00:03:43.390> when

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
will be my painting fuel cap for when

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.289 
will be my painting fuel cap for when
I'm<00:03:43.599> spraying<00:03:44.349> these<00:03:44.500> things<00:03:45.120> so<00:03:46.120> now<00:03:46.239> the

I'm spraying these things so now the

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:47.849 
I'm spraying these things so now the
carburetor<00:03:46.840> you<00:03:46.959> can<00:03:47.170> see<00:03:47.290> the<00:03:47.349> diaphragm

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:47.859 
carburetor you can see the diaphragm

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:49.440 
carburetor you can see the diaphragm
which<00:03:48.040> may<00:03:48.340> still<00:03:48.670> need<00:03:48.790> to<00:03:48.849> be<00:03:48.970> replaced<00:03:49.209> I'm

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
which may still need to be replaced I'm

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.240 
which may still need to be replaced I'm
not<00:03:49.569> sure<00:03:49.750> in<00:03:49.930> I'm<00:03:50.470> just<00:03:50.500> putting<00:03:50.829> that<00:03:50.890> spring

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
not sure in I'm just putting that spring

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:52.740 
not sure in I'm just putting that spring
in<00:03:51.400> there<00:03:51.609> it's<00:03:51.760> where<00:03:51.940> the<00:03:52.030> spring<00:03:52.329> should<00:03:52.569> be

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
in there it's where the spring should be

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.500 
in there it's where the spring should be
the<00:03:53.680> proper<00:03:54.069> spring<00:03:54.400> should<00:03:54.730> have<00:03:54.940> a<00:03:54.970> washer

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
the proper spring should have a washer

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.530 
the proper spring should have a washer
or<00:03:55.629> a<00:03:55.720> cap<00:03:56.319> on<00:03:56.500> it<00:03:56.879> and<00:03:57.879> this<00:03:58.000> one<00:03:58.239> because<00:03:58.450> he

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
or a cap on it and this one because he

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.020 
or a cap on it and this one because he
doesn't<00:03:58.920> this<00:03:59.920> is<00:04:00.099> why<00:04:00.250> it's<00:04:00.430> a<00:04:00.489> gamble<00:04:00.819> and

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
doesn't this is why it's a gamble and

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.339 
doesn't this is why it's a gamble and
I'm<00:04:01.480> not<00:04:01.599> hundred<00:04:01.870> percent<00:04:02.049> sure<00:04:02.079> if<00:04:02.230> it's

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:02.349 
I'm not hundred percent sure if it's

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:04.440 
I'm not hundred percent sure if it's
going<00:04:02.440> to<00:04:02.530> work<00:04:02.970> so<00:04:03.970> now<00:04:04.090> I<00:04:04.120> can<00:04:04.269> put<00:04:04.299> the

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
going to work so now I can put the

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.240 
going to work so now I can put the
carburetor<00:04:04.900> back<00:04:05.139> on<00:04:05.349> to<00:04:05.470> the<00:04:05.560> fuel<00:04:05.739> tank<00:04:05.769> now

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
carburetor back on to the fuel tank now

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.210 
carburetor back on to the fuel tank now
it's<00:04:06.370> been<00:04:06.549> sprayed<00:04:06.849> and<00:04:07.440> again<00:04:08.440> I've<00:04:08.920> still

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
it's been sprayed and again I've still

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.680 
it's been sprayed and again I've still
got<00:04:09.370> a<00:04:09.400> bolt<00:04:09.639> missing<00:04:10.000> I'm<00:04:10.150> going<00:04:10.359> to<00:04:10.420> try<00:04:10.599> and

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
got a bolt missing I'm going to try and

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.069 
got a bolt missing I'm going to try and
look<00:04:10.810> for<00:04:10.870> one<00:04:11.139> it's<00:04:12.099> quite<00:04:12.400> annoying<00:04:12.959> and<00:04:13.959> it

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:14.079 
look for one it's quite annoying and it

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:16.610 
look for one it's quite annoying and it
might<00:04:14.319> may<00:04:14.829> cause<00:04:15.489> an<00:04:15.670> issue<00:04:15.760> down<00:04:16.180> the<00:04:16.329> line

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
might may cause an issue down the line

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.140 
might may cause an issue down the line
because<00:04:17.620> it<00:04:17.919> could<00:04:18.250> start<00:04:18.639> sucking<00:04:19.060> up

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
because it could start sucking up

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.710 
because it could start sucking up
through<00:04:19.389> that<00:04:19.599> gap<00:04:20.699> so<00:04:21.699> ideally<00:04:22.300> it<00:04:22.449> does<00:04:22.570> need

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
through that gap so ideally it does need

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.040 
through that gap so ideally it does need
a<00:04:22.750> bolt<00:04:24.389> so<00:04:25.389> now<00:04:25.479> I'm<00:04:25.539> just<00:04:25.630> covering<00:04:25.930> up

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
a bolt so now I'm just covering up

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.270 
a bolt so now I'm just covering up
around<00:04:26.199> the<00:04:26.349> flywheel<00:04:26.740> and<00:04:26.919> everything<00:04:27.160> else

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
around the flywheel and everything else

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.210 
around the flywheel and everything else
before<00:04:28.150> I<00:04:28.419> spray<00:04:28.930> the<00:04:29.050> crankcase<00:04:29.470> and<00:04:29.530> sump

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
before I spray the crankcase and sump

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.040 
before I spray the crankcase and sump
this<00:04:31.030> is<00:04:31.120> obviously<00:04:31.389> the<00:04:31.479> bulk<00:04:31.780> of<00:04:31.930> the

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
this is obviously the bulk of the

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.560 
this is obviously the bulk of the
spraying<00:04:32.370> and<00:04:33.370> this<00:04:33.669> is<00:04:33.849> done<00:04:34.060> in<00:04:34.210> the<00:04:34.360> heat

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
spraying and this is done in the heat

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.200 
spraying and this is done in the heat
proof<00:04:34.840> cream<00:04:35.320> paint<00:04:35.680> and<00:04:35.949> this<00:04:36.789> is<00:04:36.940> high

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
proof cream paint and this is high

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:43.339 
proof cream paint and this is high
temperature<00:04:37.449> up<00:04:37.900> to<00:04:38.139> 800<00:04:38.949> degrees<00:04:39.310> Celsius<00:04:39.760> so

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:43.349 

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:46.110 

the<00:04:44.349> same<00:04:44.530> principle<00:04:45.010> here<00:04:45.160> I'm<00:04:45.699> doing<00:04:45.880> two

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
the same principle here I'm doing two

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.510 
the same principle here I'm doing two
layers<00:04:46.360> two<00:04:46.990> thin<00:04:47.229> layers<00:04:47.470> and<00:04:47.800> this<00:04:48.190> is<00:04:48.340> to

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
layers two thin layers and this is to

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.150 
layers two thin layers and this is to
prevent<00:04:48.820> any<00:04:49.030> runs<00:04:49.660> and<00:04:50.410> also<00:04:50.800> to<00:04:50.860> get<00:04:51.130> a

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
prevent any runs and also to get a

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.330 
prevent any runs and also to get a
stronger<00:04:51.520> color<00:04:51.880> in<00:04:52.150> the<00:04:52.270> end<00:04:52.419> and<00:04:53.340> being

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
stronger color in the end and being

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:55.589 
stronger color in the end and being
careful<00:04:54.669> not<00:04:54.699> to<00:04:54.940> get<00:04:55.030> any<00:04:55.090> of<00:04:55.300> the<00:04:55.360> paint

00:04:55.589 --> 00:04:55.599 
careful not to get any of the paint

00:04:55.599 --> 00:04:58.140 
careful not to get any of the paint
inside<00:04:55.870> we're<00:04:56.620> foot<00:04:56.949> we're<00:04:57.280> taking<00:04:57.639> the<00:04:57.760> spark

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
inside we're foot we're taking the spark

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.140 
inside we're foot we're taking the spark
plug<00:04:58.330> from<00:04:58.479> don't<00:04:59.020> get<00:04:59.169> any<00:04:59.289> inside<00:04:59.620> the<00:04:59.770> head

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
plug from don't get any inside the head

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:05.610 
plug from don't get any inside the head
so<00:05:01.150> you<00:05:01.210> gotta<00:05:01.810> be<00:05:01.930> careful<00:05:02.080> in<00:05:02.440> it<00:05:04.409> and<00:05:05.409> it's

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
so you gotta be careful in it and it's

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:08.279 
so you gotta be careful in it and it's
quite<00:05:05.800> hard<00:05:06.099> to<00:05:06.220> spray<00:05:06.639> into<00:05:06.849> the<00:05:07.180> fins<00:05:07.419> to<00:05:08.110> get

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:08.289 
quite hard to spray into the fins to get

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:13.529 
quite hard to spray into the fins to get
it<00:05:08.380> in<00:05:08.500> between<00:05:08.620> the<00:05:08.949> fins<00:05:11.940> so<00:05:12.940> there<00:05:13.240> we<00:05:13.389> have

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:13.539 
it in between the fins so there we have

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:16.830 
it in between the fins so there we have
it<00:05:13.659> that<00:05:13.840> is<00:05:13.870> after<00:05:14.680> the<00:05:14.949> first<00:05:15.370> coat<00:05:15.699> and<00:05:16.000> I'm

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
it that is after the first coat and I'm

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.360 
it that is after the first coat and I'm
now<00:05:17.080> going<00:05:17.260> to<00:05:17.349> leave<00:05:17.500> it<00:05:17.650> overnight

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
now going to leave it overnight

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:20.790 
now going to leave it overnight
and<00:05:18.639> then<00:05:19.270> spray<00:05:19.659> the<00:05:19.690> rest<00:05:20.020> in<00:05:20.320> the<00:05:20.470> morning

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
and then spray the rest in the morning

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.279 
and then spray the rest in the morning
when<00:05:21.220> it's<00:05:21.370> dried<00:05:21.610> out<00:05:21.760> properly<00:05:22.120> and<00:05:22.330> I

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:23.289 
when it's dried out properly and I

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:25.200 
when it's dried out properly and I
didn't<00:05:23.650> wait<00:05:23.770> for<00:05:23.800> the<00:05:24.010> other<00:05:24.430> parts<00:05:24.880> to<00:05:25.030> dry

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
didn't wait for the other parts to dry

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:26.149 
didn't wait for the other parts to dry
out<00:05:25.360> because

00:05:26.149 --> 00:05:26.159 
out because

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:28.249 
out because
this<00:05:26.849> is<00:05:27.029> obviously<00:05:27.360> the<00:05:27.479> biggest<00:05:27.689> part<00:05:28.080> and

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:28.259 
this is obviously the biggest part and

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:29.929 
this is obviously the biggest part and
the<00:05:28.589> runs<00:05:28.800> are<00:05:28.919> going<00:05:28.979> to<00:05:29.069> be<00:05:29.189> most<00:05:29.369> obvious<00:05:29.759> or

00:05:29.929 --> 00:05:29.939 
the runs are going to be most obvious or

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:31.820 
the runs are going to be most obvious or
any<00:05:30.360> defects<00:05:30.809> in<00:05:30.959> the<00:05:31.050> paint<00:05:31.259> the<00:05:31.439> other<00:05:31.589> parts

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:31.830 
any defects in the paint the other parts

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.549 
any defects in the paint the other parts
weren't<00:05:32.039> so<00:05:32.159> bad<00:05:32.309> so<00:05:33.300> like<00:05:33.809> say<00:05:34.020> and<00:05:34.259> they<00:05:34.439> be

00:05:34.549 --> 00:05:34.559 
weren't so bad so like say and they be

00:05:34.559 --> 00:05:37.009 
weren't so bad so like say and they be
spraying<00:05:34.800> this<00:05:34.979> again<00:05:35.249> in<00:05:35.369> the<00:05:35.429> morning<00:05:36.019> let

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:37.019 
spraying this again in the morning let

00:05:37.019 --> 00:05:40.040 
spraying this again in the morning let
it<00:05:37.139> dry<00:05:37.349> out<00:05:37.379> overnight<00:05:37.739> and<00:05:38.129> it<00:05:39.119> should<00:05:39.330> have

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
it dry out overnight and it should have

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:46.369 
it dry out overnight and it should have
a<00:05:40.110> better<00:05:40.499> finish<00:05:40.949> in<00:05:41.159> the<00:05:41.789> end<00:05:43.189> and<00:05:45.319> of<00:05:46.319> course

00:05:46.369 --> 00:05:46.379 
a better finish in the end and of course

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:48.019 
a better finish in the end and of course
the<00:05:46.739> heads<00:05:46.949> of<00:05:47.069> the<00:05:47.189> bolts<00:05:47.309> need<00:05:47.580> spraying<00:05:47.939> as

00:05:48.019 --> 00:05:48.029 
the heads of the bolts need spraying as

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:57.309 
the heads of the bolts need spraying as
well

00:05:57.309 --> 00:05:57.319 

00:05:57.319 --> 00:05:59.709 

so<00:05:57.949> now<00:05:58.069> moving<00:05:58.249> on<00:05:58.610> to<00:05:58.639> the<00:05:59.029> air<00:05:59.240> filter

00:05:59.709 --> 00:05:59.719 
so now moving on to the air filter

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:02.079 
so now moving on to the air filter
assembly<00:05:59.990> this<00:06:00.860> is<00:06:01.039> the<00:06:01.189> cover<00:06:01.460> for<00:06:01.580> it<00:06:01.939> and

00:06:02.079 --> 00:06:02.089 
assembly this is the cover for it and

00:06:02.089 --> 00:06:04.570 
assembly this is the cover for it and
this<00:06:02.930> has<00:06:03.080> got<00:06:03.259> quite<00:06:03.619> a<00:06:03.649> lot<00:06:03.949> of<00:06:03.979> oil<00:06:04.430> and

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:04.580 
this has got quite a lot of oil and

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:05.889 
this has got quite a lot of oil and
grease<00:06:04.729> on<00:06:05.059> it<00:06:05.089> so<00:06:05.330> I'm<00:06:05.389> just<00:06:05.509> cleaning<00:06:05.689> all

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:05.899 
grease on it so I'm just cleaning all

00:06:05.899 --> 00:06:08.799 
grease on it so I'm just cleaning all
that<00:06:06.050> off<00:06:06.169> first<00:06:06.499> and<00:06:06.770> then<00:06:06.969> I'll<00:06:07.969> go<00:06:08.149> and<00:06:08.270> sand

00:06:08.799 --> 00:06:08.809 
that off first and then I'll go and sand

00:06:08.809 --> 00:06:10.329 
that off first and then I'll go and sand
it<00:06:08.930> down<00:06:08.960> like<00:06:09.289> I<00:06:09.409> did<00:06:09.559> it<00:06:09.649> with<00:06:09.770> the<00:06:09.800> cover<00:06:10.099> and

00:06:10.329 --> 00:06:10.339 
it down like I did it with the cover and

00:06:10.339 --> 00:06:13.359 
it down like I did it with the cover and
then<00:06:11.210> again<00:06:11.539> it<00:06:11.779> can<00:06:11.990> go<00:06:12.139> and<00:06:12.289> have<00:06:12.469> a<00:06:12.710> cream

00:06:13.359 --> 00:06:13.369 
then again it can go and have a cream

00:06:13.369 --> 00:06:16.209 
then again it can go and have a cream
cover<00:06:13.819> of<00:06:14.149> paint<00:06:14.509> and<00:06:14.749> this<00:06:15.710> one<00:06:15.919> I<00:06:16.159> don't

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:16.219 
cover of paint and this one I don't

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:17.139 
cover of paint and this one I don't
think<00:06:16.430> I'm<00:06:16.610> going<00:06:16.759> to<00:06:16.819> put<00:06:16.939> the<00:06:17.029> high

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:17.149 
think I'm going to put the high

00:06:17.149 --> 00:06:18.429 
think I'm going to put the high
temperature<00:06:17.539> on<00:06:17.569> because<00:06:17.930> it<00:06:18.050> doesn't<00:06:18.289> get

00:06:18.429 --> 00:06:18.439 
temperature on because it doesn't get

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:20.379 
temperature on because it doesn't get
that<00:06:18.589> hot<00:06:18.830> gets<00:06:19.550> a<00:06:19.610> bit<00:06:19.759> warm<00:06:20.029> but<00:06:20.149> it

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:20.389 
that hot gets a bit warm but it

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:22.450 
that hot gets a bit warm but it
shouldn't<00:06:20.599> be<00:06:20.629> enough<00:06:20.899> to<00:06:21.050> be<00:06:21.139> a<00:06:21.169> problem<00:06:21.460> so

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:22.460 
shouldn't be enough to be a problem so

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.689 
shouldn't be enough to be a problem so
this<00:06:22.610> will<00:06:22.789> be<00:06:22.879> done<00:06:23.059> in<00:06:23.449> just<00:06:23.869> the<00:06:24.050> standard

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:24.699 
this will be done in just the standard

00:06:24.699 --> 00:06:42.339 
this will be done in just the standard
train<00:06:25.699> spray<00:06:26.119> paint<00:06:26.389> so<00:06:40.899> again<00:06:41.899> this<00:06:42.110> is<00:06:42.259> gonna

00:06:42.339 --> 00:06:42.349 
train spray paint so again this is gonna

00:06:42.349 --> 00:06:44.999 
train spray paint so again this is gonna
be<00:06:42.439> two<00:06:42.589> layers<00:06:42.830> same<00:06:43.789> principle<00:06:44.240> as<00:06:44.300> before

00:06:44.999 --> 00:06:45.009 
be two layers same principle as before

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:47.499 
be two layers same principle as before
