00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
is a great player but even he was trying

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.380 
is a great player but even he was trying
to<00:00:16.619> use<00:00:16.770> this<00:00:16.949> gun<00:00:17.160> like<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:17.430> DMR<00:00:17.940> which<00:00:18.240> it

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
to use this gun like a DMR which it

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.300 
to use this gun like a DMR which it
isn't<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:19.289> biggest<00:00:19.529> complaint<00:00:19.949> about<00:00:20.039> this

isn't the biggest complaint about this

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.189 
isn't the biggest complaint about this
weapon<00:00:20.640> is<00:00:20.789> it<00:00:20.970> spread<00:00:21.270> increase<00:00:21.420> but<00:00:21.779> shot<00:00:22.020> so

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
weapon is it spread increase but shot so

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.810 
weapon is it spread increase but shot so
I<00:00:22.230> thought<00:00:22.470> I'd<00:00:22.619> show<00:00:22.800> you<00:00:22.830> guys<00:00:23.100> exactly<00:00:23.340> what

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
I thought I'd show you guys exactly what

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.689 
I thought I'd show you guys exactly what
this<00:00:23.970> looks<00:00:24.240> like<00:00:24.330> when<00:00:24.660> it<00:00:24.750> kicks<00:00:24.990> in<00:00:25.400> now<00:00:26.400> in

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
this looks like when it kicks in now in

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.220 
this looks like when it kicks in now in
this<00:00:26.849> clip<00:00:27.060> I'm<00:00:27.330> going<00:00:27.359> to<00:00:27.510> shoot<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.810> gun<00:00:27.990> at

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
this clip I'm going to shoot the gun at

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.929 
this clip I'm going to shoot the gun at
its<00:00:28.410> full<00:00:28.590> rpm<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:29.220> you'll<00:00:29.519> see<00:00:29.670> it<00:00:29.760> has<00:00:29.910> a

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
its full rpm and you'll see it has a

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.220 
its full rpm and you'll see it has a
pretty<00:00:30.210> terrible<00:00:30.689> spread<00:00:33.020> obviously<00:00:34.020> at

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
pretty terrible spread obviously at

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.750 
pretty terrible spread obviously at
longer<00:00:34.620> range<00:00:34.829> this<00:00:35.130> is<00:00:35.280> going<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.489> be<00:00:35.579> much

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
longer range this is going to be much

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.700 
longer range this is going to be much
more<00:00:35.790> of<00:00:36.090> an<00:00:36.180> issue<00:00:36.300> so<00:00:36.719> firing<00:00:37.170> at<00:00:37.380> its<00:00:37.530> full

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
more of an issue so firing at its full

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.060 
more of an issue so firing at its full
RPM<00:00:38.219> is<00:00:38.460> probably<00:00:38.879> not<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.180> smart<00:00:39.450> idea<00:00:40.070> here's

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
RPM is probably not a smart idea here's

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.500 
RPM is probably not a smart idea here's
what<00:00:41.280> it<00:00:41.399> looks<00:00:41.579> like<00:00:41.760> when<00:00:41.940> you<00:00:42.059> pass<00:00:42.270> out

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
what it looks like when you pass out

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.260 
what it looks like when you pass out
your<00:00:42.690> shots<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:43.050> bit<00:00:43.200> more<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.940> as<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:45.090> can<00:00:45.239> see

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
your shots a bit more and as you can see

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.450 
your shots a bit more and as you can see
it's<00:00:45.660> pinpoint<00:00:46.200> accurate<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:46.920> i'm<00:00:47.070> still<00:00:47.340> not

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
it's pinpoint accurate and i'm still not

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.150 
it's pinpoint accurate and i'm still not
firing<00:00:47.789> that<00:00:48.059> slowly<00:00:48.469> this<00:00:49.469> gun<00:00:49.710> has<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.920> base

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
firing that slowly this gun has a base

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.160 
firing that slowly this gun has a base
abs<00:00:50.700> spread<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.090> zero<00:00:51.300> so<00:00:51.600> if<00:00:51.690> you<00:00:51.809> pace<00:00:51.989> your

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
abs spread of zero so if you pace your

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.869 
abs spread of zero so if you pace your
shots<00:00:52.440> out<00:00:52.590> like<00:00:52.829> this<00:00:53.039> you'll<00:00:53.280> hit<00:00:53.399> targets

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
shots out like this you'll hit targets

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.220 
shots out like this you'll hit targets
you<00:00:54.000> couldn't<00:00:54.300> hope<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.480> hit<00:00:54.719> with<00:00:54.930> an<00:00:55.020> assault

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
you couldn't hope to hit with an assault

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.270 
you couldn't hope to hit with an assault
rifle<00:00:55.350> or<00:00:55.739> even<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.219> DMR<00:00:57.230> here's<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.320> DMR<00:00:58.800> firing

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
rifle or even a DMR here's a DMR firing

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.750 
rifle or even a DMR here's a DMR firing
at<00:00:59.399> full<00:00:59.550> rpm<00:01:00.120> by<00:01:00.329> comparison<00:01:01.550> you'll<00:01:02.550> notice

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
at full rpm by comparison you'll notice

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.880 
at full rpm by comparison you'll notice
not<00:01:03.030> only<00:01:03.090> do<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:03.510> have<00:01:03.719> spread<00:01:04.049> deviation<00:01:04.739> to

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
not only do you have spread deviation to

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.160 
not only do you have spread deviation to
take<00:01:05.100> into<00:01:05.280> account<00:01:05.580> here<00:01:05.909> but<00:01:06.150> also<00:01:06.360> recoil

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
take into account here but also recoil

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.320 
take into account here but also recoil
even<00:01:08.100> though<00:01:08.189> on<00:01:08.310> paper<00:01:08.340> they<00:01:08.760> fire<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.060> lot

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
even though on paper they fire a lot

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.719 
even though on paper they fire a lot
faster<00:01:09.840> than<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.110> SR<00:01:10.470> 338<00:01:11.100> you'll<00:01:11.310> still<00:01:11.549> need

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
faster than the SR 338 you'll still need

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.399 
faster than the SR 338 you'll still need
to<00:01:11.880> pace<00:01:12.090> your<00:01:12.299> shots<00:01:12.510> out<00:01:12.689> at<00:01:12.930> about<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.380> same

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
to pace your shots out at about the same

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.380 
to pace your shots out at about the same
speed<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.070> make<00:01:14.250> sure<00:01:14.400> you<00:01:14.549> accurate<00:01:15.030> at<00:01:15.180> long

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
speed to make sure you accurate at long

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.660 
speed to make sure you accurate at long
range<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.890> finish<00:01:17.159> up<00:01:17.340> here's<00:01:17.610> what

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
range and to finish up here's what

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.340 
range and to finish up here's what
pacing<00:01:18.210> your<00:01:18.330> shots<00:01:18.509> out<00:01:18.720> looks<00:01:18.960> like<00:01:19.170> with

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
pacing your shots out looks like with

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.410 
pacing your shots out looks like with
the<00:01:19.470> SR<00:01:19.770> 338<00:01:20.369> next<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.000> Scout<00:01:21.270> elite

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
the SR 338 next to the Scout elite

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.109 
the SR 338 next to the Scout elite
firing<00:01:21.990> at<00:01:22.110> full<00:01:22.290> rpm<00:01:22.860> which<00:01:23.070> is<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.580> fastest

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
firing at full rpm which is the fastest

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.690 
firing at full rpm which is the fastest
firing<00:01:24.540> bolt-action<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.409> as<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:26.520> can<00:01:26.670> see

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
firing bolt-action and as you can see

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.880 
firing bolt-action and as you can see
the<00:01:26.970> SR<00:01:27.270> 338<00:01:27.869> is<00:01:28.049> throwing<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.530> lot<00:01:28.710> more

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
the SR 338 is throwing a lot more

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.859 
the SR 338 is throwing a lot more
bullets<00:01:29.220> downrange<00:01:29.729> much<00:01:30.030> more<00:01:30.270> quickly<00:01:30.479> and

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
bullets downrange much more quickly and

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.960 
bullets downrange much more quickly and
you<00:01:31.229> also<00:01:31.439> don't<00:01:31.650> have<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.250> reach<00:01:32.430> aim<00:01:32.700> bring

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
you also don't have the reach aim bring

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.550 
you also don't have the reach aim bring
animation<00:01:33.540> getting<00:01:33.810> in<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:33.990> way<00:01:34.140> of<00:01:34.170> your
