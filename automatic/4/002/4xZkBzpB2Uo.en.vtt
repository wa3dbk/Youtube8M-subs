00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
there's a quick way that you could do

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.970 
there's a quick way that you could do
that<00:02:14.890> and<00:02:15.130> anyway<00:02:15.990> as<00:02:16.990> I<00:02:17.050> was<00:02:17.140> addressing<00:02:17.500> yes

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
that and anyway as I was addressing yes

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.040 
that and anyway as I was addressing yes
I've<00:02:18.220> known<00:02:18.700> er<00:02:18.880> no<00:02:19.180> earthly<00:02:19.360> idea<00:02:19.600> why<00:02:19.900> they

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
I've known er no earthly idea why they

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.940 
I've known er no earthly idea why they
changed<00:02:20.350> that<00:02:21.420> I've<00:02:22.420> hardly<00:02:22.810> thinks<00:02:23.650> that

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
changed that I've hardly thinks that

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.860 
changed that I've hardly thinks that
what<00:02:24.250> might<00:02:24.550> have<00:02:24.700> happened<00:02:24.730> is<00:02:25.240> they<00:02:25.600> thought

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
what might have happened is they thought

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.260 
what might have happened is they thought
it<00:02:26.020> made<00:02:26.230> no<00:02:26.470> sense<00:02:26.500> that<00:02:26.980> the<00:02:27.550> FBI<00:02:27.880> was

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
it made no sense that the FBI was

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.000 
it made no sense that the FBI was
randomly<00:02:28.690> coming<00:02:29.080> after<00:02:29.410> you<00:02:29.530> after<00:02:29.709> you

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
randomly coming after you after you

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.080 
randomly coming after you after you
killed<00:02:30.250> Salvatori

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
killed Salvatori

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.940 
killed Salvatori
and<00:02:31.240> maybe<00:02:31.900> they<00:02:32.200> thought<00:02:32.410> that<00:02:32.590> they<00:02:32.740> should

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
and maybe they thought that they should

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.910 
and maybe they thought that they should
give<00:02:33.130> some<00:02:33.340> closure<00:02:33.670> to<00:02:33.910> the<00:02:34.180> mission<00:02:34.569> and

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
give some closure to the mission and

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.350 
give some closure to the mission and
closure<00:02:35.920> to<00:02:36.160> the<00:02:36.250> whole<00:02:36.400> mafia<00:02:36.610> because<00:02:37.000> you

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
closure to the whole mafia because you

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.150 
closure to the whole mafia because you
kill<00:02:37.540> Salvatore<00:02:38.110> head<00:02:38.290> and<00:02:38.440> nothing<00:02:38.860> happens

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
kill Salvatore head and nothing happens

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.589 
kill Salvatore head and nothing happens
with<00:02:39.340> the<00:02:39.430> Mafia<00:02:39.790> it<00:02:39.849> makes<00:02:40.030> absolutely<00:02:40.510> no

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
with the Mafia it makes absolutely no

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:44.010 
with the Mafia it makes absolutely no
sense<00:02:40.890> so<00:02:41.890> for<00:02:42.730> that<00:02:42.790> reason<00:02:42.849> it<00:02:43.599> could<00:02:43.810> be

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
sense so for that reason it could be

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.020 
sense so for that reason it could be
that<00:02:44.319> they<00:02:44.470> decided<00:02:44.980> to<00:02:45.099> change<00:02:45.430> the<00:02:45.580> dialogue

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
that they decided to change the dialogue

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.059 
that they decided to change the dialogue

what's<00:03:52.330> the<00:03:52.450> word<00:03:52.920> not<00:03:53.920> death<00:03:54.190> animation<00:03:54.760> but

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
what's the word not death animation but

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.180 
what's the word not death animation but
like<00:03:55.090> you<00:03:55.569> won't<00:03:55.720> see<00:03:55.959> any<00:03:56.170> body<00:03:56.500> important

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190

and resting like that so that's really

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:00.690 
and resting like that so that's really
odd<00:03:59.349> maybe<00:03:59.890> it's<00:04:00.069> because<00:04:00.190> I<00:04:00.370> shot<00:04:00.580> him<00:04:00.670> with

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
odd maybe it's because I shot him with

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.880 
odd maybe it's because I shot him with
the<00:04:01.019> sniper<00:04:02.019> rifle<00:04:02.410> or<00:04:02.470> something<00:04:02.769> I<00:04:02.830> don't

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890

like<00:07:14.979> that<00:07:15.129> mission<00:07:15.400> actually<00:07:15.759> because<00:07:16.000> it's

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:16.120 
like that mission actually because it's

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.670 
like that mission actually because it's
the<00:07:16.240> last<00:07:16.389> did<00:07:16.629> you<00:07:16.719> see<00:07:16.900> the<00:07:17.080> Mafia<00:07:17.409> and<00:07:17.500> the

the last did you see the Mafia and the
gay<00:07:17.830> bits<00:07:18.159> yeah<00:07:18.610> but<00:07:18.969> it<00:07:19.300> makes<00:07:19.509> sense<00:07:19.810> for

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:19.960 
gay bits yeah but it makes sense for

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:21.329 
gay bits yeah but it makes sense for
them<00:07:20.050> to<00:07:20.110> attack<00:07:20.469> you<00:07:20.620> after<00:07:20.889> you<00:07:20.949> kill<00:07:21.129> Sam

00:07:21.329 --> 00:07:21.339 
them to attack you after you kill Sam

00:07:21.339 --> 00:07:23.459 
them to attack you after you kill Sam
with<00:07:21.460> ornery<00:07:21.819> obviously<00:07:22.300> because<00:07:22.689> it<00:07:23.169> seems

00:07:23.459 --> 00:07:23.469 
with ornery obviously because it seems

00:07:23.469 --> 00:07:24.689 
with ornery obviously because it seems
to<00:07:23.589> me<00:07:23.680> that<00:07:23.710> the<00:07:23.919> original<00:07:24.250> intention<00:07:24.669> was

00:07:24.689 --> 00:07:24.699 
to me that the original intention was

00:07:24.699 --> 00:07:27.149 
to me that the original intention was
just<00:07:24.879> to<00:07:25.150> have<00:07:25.330> this<00:07:25.599> random<00:07:25.839> FBI<00:07:26.349> thing<00:07:26.800> going

00:07:27.149 --> 00:07:27.159 
just to have this random FBI thing going

00:07:27.159 --> 00:07:28.709 
just to have this random FBI thing going
on<00:07:27.339> and<00:07:27.580> just<00:07:27.610> to<00:07:27.849> forget<00:07:28.089> about<00:07:28.150> the<00:07:28.389> Matthew

00:07:28.709 --> 00:07:28.719 
on and just to forget about the Matthew

00:07:28.719 --> 00:07:30.360 
on and just to forget about the Matthew
completely<00:07:29.259> which<00:07:29.409> makes<00:07:29.620> no<00:07:29.800> sense<00:07:30.069> so

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:30.370 
completely which makes no sense so

00:07:30.370 --> 00:07:33.089
