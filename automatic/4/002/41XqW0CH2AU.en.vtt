00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.760 
which I assume will flash if you've got
low<00:01:48.149> battery<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.630> needs<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.960> go<00:01:49.049> on<00:01:49.079> charge<00:01:49.500> and

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
low battery it needs to go on charge and

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.520 
low battery it needs to go on charge and
then<00:01:50.759> um<00:01:50.939> on<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.390> bottom<00:01:51.630> it's<00:01:51.810> got<00:01:51.990> so<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.290> few

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
then um on the bottom it's got so a few

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.899 
then um on the bottom it's got so a few
little<00:01:52.770> switches<00:01:53.040> as<00:01:53.369> you<00:01:53.520> can<00:01:53.670> flick<00:01:53.880> a

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
little switches as you can flick a

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.300 
little switches as you can flick a
switch<00:01:54.540> NFC<00:01:55.200> off<00:01:55.380> if<00:01:55.890> you<00:01:56.040> just<00:01:56.070> got<00:01:56.280> a

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
switch NFC off if you just got a

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.770 
switch NFC off if you just got a
Bluetooth<00:01:56.670> phone<00:01:56.820> without<00:01:57.000> NFC<00:01:57.479> or<00:01:57.570> whatever

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
Bluetooth phone without NFC or whatever

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.469 
Bluetooth phone without NFC or whatever
and<00:01:58.020> then<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:58.920> just<00:01:59.040> goes<00:01:59.219> in<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.430> middle<00:01:59.549> -<00:01:59.969> so

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
and then it just goes in the middle - so

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.149 
and then it just goes in the middle - so
which<00:02:00.659> you<00:02:00.810> can<00:02:00.960> just<00:02:01.140> use<00:02:01.320> your<00:02:01.350> NFC<00:02:01.829> phone<00:02:01.979> or

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
which you can just use your NFC phone or

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.859 
which you can just use your NFC phone or
connected<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.610> easily<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.390> I'm<00:02:03.509> guessing<00:02:03.780> if

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
connected to easily and I'm guessing if

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:04.910 
connected to easily and I'm guessing if
you<00:02:03.930> don't<00:02:04.079> have<00:02:04.200> anything<00:02:04.409> in<00:02:04.590> your<00:02:04.740> phone

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
you don't have anything in your phone

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.770 
you don't have anything in your phone
you<00:02:04.950> have<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.280> hold<00:02:05.610> that<00:02:05.700> down<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:06.270> connect<00:02:06.570> it

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
you have to hold that down to connect it

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.919 
you have to hold that down to connect it
by<00:02:07.079> bluetooth<00:02:07.910> so<00:02:08.910> we've<00:02:09.030> got<00:02:09.149> our<00:02:09.300> NFC

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
by bluetooth so we've got our NFC

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.300 
by bluetooth so we've got our NFC
