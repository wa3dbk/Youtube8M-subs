00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.580
 in oaxaca there are 16 indigenous languages 

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:12.749
 in less than 300 to plant 

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:14.729
 one is at risk of getting lost 

00:00:14.729 --> 00:00:17.729
 all stopped talking and disappeared forever 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.030
 authorities have implemented various strategies to rescue the 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:23.119
 mother tongue 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.859
 and strengthen the ancestral culture one of these is the installation of 29 makeup 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:32.410
 integral community times where young indigenous people are prepared 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.780
 is that they feel proud of their ethnic identity in teotitlan del 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.780
 valley hall one of these there study Zapotec for three semesters to 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.780
 Luis is not difficult because it was his first language 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.570
 I'm not broken to see you 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.560
 There are so many that sink 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.560
 it cost us a point in common 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.110
 this 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:00.140
 the tdt 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.140
 consists of a prisoner this whatever 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.540
 no patient nor in any area 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.060
 all 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.050
 Bravo 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.360
 7 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.140
 nor the teachers and directors of this school 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.550
 integrates subjects such as identity, community values, social rights and 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.440
 collectives of indigenous peoples all with the objective of keeping alive 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.980
 the ethnic roots and above all and what we look for in young people 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.550
 is that they strengthen 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.240
 these characteristics do not identify it as 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.360
 I am indigenous 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.670
 which is very, very important, especially 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.590
 to feel honored of them moments are in that we seek in this case we 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.230
 to study 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.460
 and to register 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.350
 surely create a dramatic and a dictionary of constitutional support 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.840
 said bonus also that 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.190
 about this is this proposal for 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.220
 to disseminate and study in a month as an academic sense what is the language 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.390
 Zapotec 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.389
 these young people are convinced of their origin 

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:13.449
 that is why they invite those who open a mother tongue who do not feel ashamed 

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:18.199
 because they belong to an indigenous group, on the contrary, they have to feel 

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:20.849
 proud of them children because 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:21.750
 is 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.539
 It is something that distinguishes us 

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:25.939
 it's a culture of them and for that 

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:30.079
 It is not good for them since the pilot of this system decided 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:33.189
 educational will see future generations 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:38.249
 if they want to keep their roots alive for a long time according to these facts 

00:02:38.249 --> 00:02:38.869
 Virginia 

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:41.699
 in carabobo and the analyst 

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:44.699
 effect that has a very small cost 

00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:49.269
 A bit cloudy, there was no success 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:50.959
 68 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:55.790
 for now the teotitlan youth of the valley struggle to rescue their culture and 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.420
 put up the name of your community
