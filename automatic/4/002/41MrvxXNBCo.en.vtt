00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.519
 Well now of the claim of alliance that 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:11.639
 comes 80 years later, yes because the 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.370
 intimates claim to be champions of the 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.440
 season of year 34 after a 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.420
 controversy that was generated and where the 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.000
 circle formed at the university of 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.820
 sports the background of the matter is in that 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.099
 if you are assigned the championship here the 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.920
 34 Lima alliance would be the only 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.349
 four-time champion of history here is the 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.930
 report the arguments that killing and 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.700
 alliance to claim the title of the year 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.360
 3. 4 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.850
 in 1931 the first Peruvian championship 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.430
 division was structured based on the 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.680
 tournaments played in parallel 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.620
 First team tournament and tournament 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.390
 of reserves both competitions had 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.150
 impact on the definition of the champion 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.920
 of the season so the general table will 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.809
 formed on the basis of the sum of the 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.809
 points earned in the tournament 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:05.220
 first equipment to which was added a 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:08.490
 bonus of 0.25 points for each 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.820
 unit obtained in the reserve tournament 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.950
 in 1934 university and alliance 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.800
 they finished tied in the tournament of 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.590
 first teams with 21 points each 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.420
 however in the reserve tournament the 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.570
 'intimates' beat their classic rival 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.640
 for 23 units against 22 in 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.190
 consequence in application of the system 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.590
 Bonus points described above 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.840
 Lima alliance was located in the first 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.440
 place the general table for a 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.810
 difference of 0.25 points being for 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.330
 it proclaimed as absolute champion 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.659
 of the tournament as report the trade the 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.249
 10 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:49.350
 November 9, 1934 as claims by 

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:51.210
 part of university says the 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.130
 aliancist argument that the 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.560
 'creams' claimed that a championship does not 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.789
 could be defined by such narrow margin 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.950
 ie 0.25 points further case 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:05.939
 of a secondary tournament like that of 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.859
 reservations on February 20, 1935 the 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:11.160
 provincial league of lima in my thermos

 of 1934 between the compadres and is that 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:23.819
 Of course both concluded with 21 units 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:27.660
 the league is lime in my thermos him 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:30.750

 hear well the first tournament desert 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.400
 equipment in the absence of interest from 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.879
 two clubs to determine the date of 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.340
 the definition on June 18, 1935 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:43.379
 according to the documents presented by the 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.410
 aliancista investigation is issued the 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:48.960
 newsletter 169 where three are explained 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.030
 points the most important one 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.580
 proclaim first division champion and 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.890
 League club Alianza Lima by 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.590
 have obtained the first place in the 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:01.080
 general classification 2 declare 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.210
 desert again the championship of 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:06.150
 first teams that ended tied 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:08.640
 by alliance and university because it 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.260
 play the extra college game 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.630
 decided to play to see the 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.330
 champion of first teams while 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:18.240
 alliance has already designated also accepts 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:21.060
 to place such a match and perhaps from 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:23.430
 there the controversy is generated as soon as 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:27.170
 to the character that that party had 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:29.850
 additional on July 7, 1935 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.660
 university wins by two goals to one 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:36.000
 and the title of the category is awarded 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:38.340
 specified but not the title of champion 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.520
 absolute that had been granted to the 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.710
 intimate months before because the federation 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:47.490
 Peruvian soccer college slogan 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:49.410
 then like the monarch of that 1934 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.450
 it is very likely that those who 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.740
 they made the list of champions to 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.680
 throughout the history of our 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.659
 football maybe they did not take into account 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.489
 and they bulletins or clippings 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:01.489
 journalistic ethics 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.760
 would be the 23rd star for alliance 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.440
 lima would take a university 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.940
 sports let's see what defines the 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.130
 Peruvian soccer federation 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.270
 today consulted on the subject in bits or 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.610
 the president of the federation manuel 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:18.070
 burga and because if it took 80 years 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:23.489
 in making the query may be delayed 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:23.489
 some time maybe a year in giving a network
