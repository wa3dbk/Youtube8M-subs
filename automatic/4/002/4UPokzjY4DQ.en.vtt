00:00:06.189 --> 00:00:08.950 

hi<00:00:07.189> everybody<00:00:07.549> this<00:00:07.729> is<00:00:07.790> jamie<00:00:08.090> with<00:00:08.299> c4<00:00:08.660> depot

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:08.960 
hi everybody this is jamie with c4 depot

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.680 
hi everybody this is jamie with c4 depot
and<00:00:09.170> i<00:00:09.830> just<00:00:10.010> made<00:00:10.160> a<00:00:10.190> new<00:00:10.309> little<00:00:11.240> creeping

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:11.690 
and i just made a new little creeping

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.490 
and i just made a new little creeping
fig<00:00:11.990> shader<00:00:12.349> for<00:00:12.650> your<00:00:13.280> exterior<00:00:13.700> models<00:00:14.240> and

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:14.500 
fig shader for your exterior models and

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.570 
fig shader for your exterior models and
i<00:00:15.500> just<00:00:15.680> want<00:00:15.799> to<00:00:15.859> show<00:00:16.010> you<00:00:16.070> quickly<00:00:16.340> how<00:00:16.460> to

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:16.580 
i just want to show you quickly how to

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.939 
i just want to show you quickly how to
use<00:00:16.850> it<00:00:17.029> when<00:00:17.930> you<00:00:17.960> open<00:00:18.260> it<00:00:18.320> up<00:00:18.470> this<00:00:18.619> is<00:00:18.800> what

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:18.949 
use it when you open it up this is what

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:22.779 
use it when you open it up this is what
you'll<00:00:19.100> see<00:00:19.400> and<00:00:19.840> the<00:00:20.840> shader<00:00:21.740> consists<00:00:22.369> of<00:00:22.490> a

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:22.789 
you'll see and the shader consists of a

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:27.759 
you'll see and the shader consists of a
base<00:00:23.630> layer<00:00:24.410> of<00:00:24.650> textures<00:00:25.189> and<00:00:26.380> some<00:00:27.380> skins

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:27.769 
base layer of textures and some skins

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:30.390 
base layer of textures and some skins
that<00:00:28.039> are<00:00:28.159> over<00:00:28.489> that<00:00:28.640> that's<00:00:28.999> actually

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:30.400 
that are over that that's actually

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.200 
that are over that that's actually
geometry<00:00:31.400> that<00:00:31.900> leaves<00:00:32.900> go<00:00:33.170> on<00:00:33.350> to<00:00:33.760> yeah<00:00:34.760> so

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
geometry that leaves go on to yeah so

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.670 
geometry that leaves go on to yeah so
this<00:00:35.930> is<00:00:36.140> your<00:00:36.700> base<00:00:37.700> geometry<00:00:38.390> and<00:00:38.680> you've

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
this is your base geometry and you've

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.450 
this is your base geometry and you've
got<00:00:39.860> you<00:00:40.310> know<00:00:40.340> some<00:00:40.460> viney<00:00:41.330> things<00:00:41.810> and<00:00:42.460> some

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.460 
got you know some viney things and some

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.340 
got you know some viney things and some
small<00:00:43.760> detail<00:00:44.120> in<00:00:44.300> some<00:00:44.480> medium<00:00:44.750> detail<00:00:45.110> and

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
small detail in some medium detail and

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.500 
small detail in some medium detail and
then<00:00:45.440> when<00:00:45.590> you<00:00:47.800> turn<00:00:48.800> on<00:00:48.980> the<00:00:49.310> larger<00:00:50.180> detail

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
then when you turn on the larger detail

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:51.850 
then when you turn on the larger detail
basically<00:00:50.870> what<00:00:50.990> you're<00:00:51.080> just<00:00:51.290> doing<00:00:51.710> is

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
basically what you're just doing is

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.940 
basically what you're just doing is
you're<00:00:52.130> you're<00:00:52.930> putting<00:00:53.930> a<00:00:53.990> little<00:00:54.350> piece<00:00:54.800> of

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:54.950 
you're you're putting a little piece of

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.970 
you're you're putting a little piece of
geometry<00:00:55.780> over<00:00:56.780> your<00:00:56.990> model<00:00:57.380> which<00:00:57.590> is<00:00:57.620> this

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
geometry over your model which is this

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.310 
geometry over your model which is this
thing<00:00:58.190> right<00:00:58.370> here<00:00:58.720> right<00:00:59.720> there<00:00:59.930> like<00:01:00.140> that

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
thing right here right there like that

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.780 
thing right here right there like that
and<00:01:01.690> applying<00:01:02.690> the<00:01:02.810> leaves<00:01:03.020> to<00:01:03.560> it<00:01:03.710> and<00:01:04.040> you

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
and applying the leaves to it and you

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.280 
and applying the leaves to it and you
can<00:01:04.939> apply<00:01:05.150> you<00:01:05.570> know<00:01:05.659> however<00:01:05.869> many<00:01:06.020> layers

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
can apply you know however many layers

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:07.539 
can apply you know however many layers
you<00:01:06.470> want<00:01:06.680> your<00:01:06.860> depending<00:01:07.159> on<00:01:07.220> how<00:01:07.280> thick<00:01:07.460> you

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
you want your depending on how thick you

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:09.730 
you want your depending on how thick you
want<00:01:07.610> your<00:01:07.759> IV<00:01:08.119> but<00:01:08.320> just<00:01:09.320> to<00:01:09.409> show<00:01:09.530> you<00:01:09.560> how

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
want your IV but just to show you how

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.120 
want your IV but just to show you how
this<00:01:09.860> works<00:01:10.250> um<00:01:11.110> I've<00:01:12.110> made<00:01:12.350> up<00:01:12.470> another<00:01:12.740> model

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
this works um I've made up another model

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.700 
this works um I've made up another model
I'm<00:01:13.220> going<00:01:13.370> to<00:01:13.430> apply<00:01:13.520> these<00:01:14.230> shaders<00:01:15.230> to<00:01:15.440> so

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
I'm going to apply these shaders to so

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.090 
I'm going to apply these shaders to so
we're<00:01:15.950> going<00:01:16.040> to<00:01:16.130> copy<00:01:16.340> these<00:01:16.580> and<00:01:17.890> then<00:01:18.890> go

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
we're going to copy these and then go

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.090 
we're going to copy these and then go
into<00:01:19.250> my<00:01:19.700> tunnel<00:01:20.330> or<00:01:21.050> my<00:01:21.229> little<00:01:21.470> archway<00:01:21.860> and

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
into my tunnel or my little archway and

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.010 
into my tunnel or my little archway and
I'm<00:01:22.820> just<00:01:22.970> going<00:01:23.090> to<00:01:23.120> paste<00:01:23.360> these<00:01:23.570> in<00:01:23.810> here

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
I'm just going to paste these in here

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.390 
I'm just going to paste these in here
and<00:01:26.200> I've<00:01:27.200> already<00:01:27.470> made<00:01:27.590> a<00:01:27.740> selection<00:01:27.950> tag

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
and I've already made a selection tag

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.580 
and I've already made a selection tag
for<00:01:28.700> the<00:01:28.760> part<00:01:29.030> of<00:01:29.659> this<00:01:29.900> structure<00:01:30.320> where<00:01:30.530> I

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
for the part of this structure where I

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.130 
for the part of this structure where I
want<00:01:30.830> to<00:01:30.920> apply<00:01:31.159> the<00:01:31.190> shader<00:01:31.909> so<00:01:32.240> I'm<00:01:32.960> just

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
want to apply the shader so I'm just

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.289 
want to apply the shader so I'm just
going<00:01:33.260> to<00:01:33.320> take<00:01:33.590> these<00:01:33.830> and<00:01:34.220> just<00:01:34.310> like<00:01:34.729> drop

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
going to take these and just like drop

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:38.289 
going to take these and just like drop
them<00:01:35.479> right<00:01:35.510> on<00:01:35.840> there<00:01:36.190> okay<00:01:37.190> and<00:01:37.430> it's<00:01:38.030> I

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
them right on there okay and it's I

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:40.120 
them right on there okay and it's I
think<00:01:38.870> it's<00:01:38.990> best<00:01:39.170> to<00:01:39.320> have<00:01:39.440> the<00:01:39.560> vines<00:01:39.830> on<00:01:40.100> the

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
think it's best to have the vines on the

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.539 
think it's best to have the vines on the
bottom<00:01:41.090> layer<00:01:41.299> and<00:01:41.540> then<00:01:42.170> your<00:01:42.710> medium<00:01:43.430> and

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
bottom layer and then your medium and

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:45.399 
bottom layer and then your medium and
then<00:01:43.640> your<00:01:43.760> large<00:01:43.940> detail<00:01:44.360> but<00:01:44.570> you<00:01:45.290> know

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
then your large detail but you know

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:46.990 
then your large detail but you know
probably<00:01:46.010> doesn't<00:01:46.310> really<00:01:46.430> make<00:01:46.580> that<00:01:46.940> much

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
probably doesn't really make that much

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.520 
probably doesn't really make that much
of<00:01:47.120> a<00:01:47.240> difference<00:01:47.270> but<00:01:47.630> if<00:01:48.619> you<00:01:48.770> do<00:01:48.950> a<00:01:50.530> quick

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
of a difference but if you do a quick

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.310 
of a difference but if you do a quick
render

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.469 

you'll<00:01:56.890> see<00:01:57.070> it<00:01:57.159> looks<00:01:57.340> kind<00:01:57.730> of<00:01:57.760> like<00:01:57.850> okay<00:01:58.270> I

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
you'll see it looks kind of like okay I

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:00.660 
you'll see it looks kind of like okay I
mean<00:01:58.659> I<00:01:58.900> think<00:01:59.260> that<00:01:59.740> you're<00:02:00.370> going<00:02:00.490> to<00:02:00.550> have

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
mean I think that you're going to have

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.460 
mean I think that you're going to have
to<00:02:00.820> adjust<00:02:01.810> the<00:02:02.790> scaling<00:02:03.790> of<00:02:03.909> this<00:02:04.120> and<00:02:04.360> so<00:02:05.290> let

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
to adjust the scaling of this and so let

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.130 
to adjust the scaling of this and so let
me<00:02:05.530> just<00:02:05.680> go<00:02:05.860> into<00:02:06.070> the<00:02:06.190> medium<00:02:06.870> detail<00:02:07.870> for<00:02:08.110> a

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
me just go into the medium detail for a

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.040 
me just go into the medium detail for a
second<00:02:08.560> and<00:02:09.149> they<00:02:10.149> but<00:02:10.300> I<00:02:10.360> want<00:02:10.539> to<00:02:10.600> do<00:02:10.780> is<00:02:10.929> I

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
second and they but I want to do is I

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.280 
second and they but I want to do is I
want<00:02:11.080> to<00:02:11.730> adjust<00:02:12.730> this<00:02:13.270> global<00:02:13.720> scale<00:02:13.990> on<00:02:14.170> this

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
want to adjust this global scale on this

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.480 
want to adjust this global scale on this
bump<00:02:14.620> map<00:02:14.800> to<00:02:14.950> something<00:02:15.220> a<00:02:15.250> little<00:02:15.340> bit

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
bump map to something a little bit

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.420 
bump map to something a little bit
smaller<00:02:15.790> like<00:02:16.090> 30<00:02:16.620> and<00:02:17.620> see<00:02:17.830> if<00:02:17.920> that<00:02:17.950> looks<00:02:18.340> a

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
smaller like 30 and see if that looks a

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.320 
smaller like 30 and see if that looks a
little<00:02:18.580> bit<00:02:19.830> more<00:02:20.830> like<00:02:21.010> fig<00:02:21.250> leaves<00:02:21.490> yeah<00:02:21.790> see

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
little bit more like fig leaves yeah see

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.560 
little bit more like fig leaves yeah see
look<00:02:22.420> at<00:02:22.510> that<00:02:22.800> okay<00:02:23.800> so<00:02:24.420> you're<00:02:25.420> going<00:02:25.510> to

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
look at that okay so you're going to

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.740 
look at that okay so you're going to
have<00:02:25.660> to<00:02:26.550> you<00:02:27.550> know<00:02:27.670> maybe<00:02:28.240> do<00:02:28.390> a<00:02:28.420> little<00:02:28.480> bit

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
have to you know maybe do a little bit

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:29.820 
have to you know maybe do a little bit
of<00:02:28.780> fiddling<00:02:28.959> with<00:02:29.200> it<00:02:29.260> depending<00:02:29.650> on<00:02:29.739> the

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
of fiddling with it depending on the

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.110 
of fiddling with it depending on the
scale<00:02:30.100> of<00:02:30.130> your<00:02:30.400> of<00:02:30.730> your<00:02:30.880> model<00:02:31.360> so<00:02:32.020> uh<00:02:33.120> you

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
scale of your of your model so uh you

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.430 
scale of your of your model so uh you
know<00:02:34.239> I've<00:02:34.390> actually<00:02:34.600> that<00:02:34.900> kind<00:02:35.230> of<00:02:35.260> looks

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
know I've actually that kind of looks

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.050 
know I've actually that kind of looks
okay<00:02:35.739> I<00:02:35.770> mean<00:02:36.160> you<00:02:36.370> know<00:02:36.489> it's<00:02:36.730> there's

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
okay I mean you know it's there's

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.340 
okay I mean you know it's there's
there's<00:02:37.120> nothing<00:02:37.720> wrong<00:02:37.840> with<00:02:37.900> just<00:02:38.170> doing

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
there's nothing wrong with just doing

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:39.750 
there's nothing wrong with just doing
that<00:02:38.470> depends<00:02:38.950> on<00:02:39.070> you<00:02:39.340> know<00:02:39.459> what<00:02:39.580> you're

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
that depends on you know what you're

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.560 
that depends on you know what you're
what<00:02:39.970> you're<00:02:40.000> doing<00:02:40.380> however<00:02:41.380> um<00:02:42.360> I've<00:02:43.360> also

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
what you're doing however um I've also

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.890 
what you're doing however um I've also
made<00:02:43.870> this<00:02:44.080> other<00:02:44.760> piece<00:02:45.760> of<00:02:45.790> geometry<00:02:46.090> it's

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
made this other piece of geometry it's

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:54.810 
made this other piece of geometry it's
this<00:02:47.860> cube<00:02:48.280> here<00:02:50.880> ok<00:02:51.880> so<00:02:52.830> we<00:02:53.830> turn<00:02:54.040> this<00:02:54.160> piece

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
this cube here ok so we turn this piece

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:01.020 
this cube here ok so we turn this piece
of<00:02:54.940> geometry<00:02:55.120> on<00:02:55.600> and<00:02:59.400> what<00:03:00.400> you<00:03:00.489> want<00:03:00.670> to<00:03:00.760> do

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
of geometry on and what you want to do

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.280 
of geometry on and what you want to do
is<00:03:01.450> just<00:03:02.140> made<00:03:03.070> a<00:03:03.100> little<00:03:03.430> you<00:03:03.970> know<00:03:04.090> I<00:03:04.390> don't

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
is just made a little you know I don't

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:06.660 
is just made a little you know I don't
know<00:03:05.350> kind<00:03:05.530> of<00:03:05.560> a<00:03:05.650> cube<00:03:05.980> around<00:03:06.250> this<00:03:06.430> thing

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
know kind of a cube around this thing

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.570 
know kind of a cube around this thing
and<00:03:07.049> I<00:03:08.049> think<00:03:08.410> the<00:03:08.680> easiest<00:03:08.830> way<00:03:09.160> to<00:03:09.220> do<00:03:09.430> this

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
and I think the easiest way to do this

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.180 
and I think the easiest way to do this
is<00:03:09.640> just<00:03:09.790> to<00:03:10.030> take<00:03:10.269> take<00:03:10.720> your<00:03:11.010> selection<00:03:12.010> tool

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
is just to take take your selection tool

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.310 
is just to take take your selection tool
and<00:03:12.250> just<00:03:12.489> draw<00:03:13.269> a<00:03:13.299> pattern<00:03:13.720> of<00:03:13.989> where<00:03:14.200> you

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
and just draw a pattern of where you

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:20.190 
and just draw a pattern of where you
want<00:03:14.560> your<00:03:14.739> IV<00:03:15.070> to<00:03:15.190> go<00:03:15.370> and<00:03:16.350> you<00:03:18.150> know<00:03:19.200> you

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
want your IV to go and you know you

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.600 
want your IV to go and you know you
probably<00:03:20.500> want<00:03:20.769> a<00:03:20.799> little<00:03:20.950> bit<00:03:21.100> more<00:03:21.280> coverage

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
probably want a little bit more coverage

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.940 
probably want a little bit more coverage
than<00:03:21.820> like<00:03:22.720> not<00:03:23.019> so<00:03:23.230> much<00:03:23.380> coverage<00:03:23.880> but<00:03:24.880> oops

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
than like not so much coverage but oops

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.220 
than like not so much coverage but oops
don't<00:03:26.950> touch<00:03:27.640> the<00:03:27.910> access<00:03:28.420> bands<00:03:28.870> and<00:03:29.019> you'll

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
don't touch the access bands and you'll

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:36.330 
don't touch the access bands and you'll
really<00:03:29.530> mess<00:03:29.860> things<00:03:29.890> up<00:03:30.310> so

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.280 

it<00:03:37.340> really<00:03:37.550> doesn't<00:03:37.850> take<00:03:37.880> a<00:03:38.270> whole<00:03:39.020> lot<00:03:39.080> of

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
it really doesn't take a whole lot of

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.270 
it really doesn't take a whole lot of
time<00:03:39.710> but<00:03:39.950> you<00:03:40.340> know<00:03:40.600> you<00:03:41.600> can<00:03:41.750> do<00:03:41.960> this<00:03:42.280> to

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
time but you know you can do this to

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:51.910 
time but you know you can do this to
your<00:03:43.370> heart's<00:03:43.670> content

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.920 

okay<00:03:53.209> this<00:03:54.209> is<00:03:54.390> actually<00:03:54.689> really<00:03:54.720> the

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
okay this is actually really the

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.130 
okay this is actually really the
simplest<00:03:55.230> way<00:03:55.379> to<00:03:55.409> do<00:03:55.680> it<00:03:56.150> you<00:03:57.150> can<00:03:57.299> have<00:03:57.900> some

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
simplest way to do it you can have some

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:06.490 
simplest way to do it you can have some
stuff<00:03:58.349> going<00:03:58.409> up<00:03:58.739> the<00:03:58.890> sides<00:03:59.129> if<00:03:59.340> you<00:03:59.459> want

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:10.670 

okay<00:04:07.609> so<00:04:08.609> once<00:04:09.390> you've<00:04:09.540> done<00:04:09.810> that<00:04:09.870> do<00:04:10.620> a

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
okay so once you've done that do a

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.119 
okay so once you've done that do a
selection<00:04:11.099> select<00:04:11.819> invert<00:04:12.720> and<00:04:13.409> let's<00:04:14.069> just

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:14.129 
selection select invert and let's just

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:16.400 
selection select invert and let's just
delete<00:04:14.400> all<00:04:14.700> that<00:04:14.879> stuff<00:04:15.180> okay<00:04:15.480> so<00:04:15.540> now<00:04:15.810> this

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
delete all that stuff okay so now this

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.110 
delete all that stuff okay so now this
is<00:04:16.560> going<00:04:16.650> to<00:04:16.769> be<00:04:16.889> your<00:04:17.100> IV<00:04:17.549> and<00:04:17.699> I<00:04:17.789> would

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
is going to be your IV and I would

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.480 
is going to be your IV and I would
recommend<00:04:18.919> hi<00:04:19.919> perturbing<00:04:20.370> this<00:04:22.070> okay<00:04:23.070> so

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
recommend hi perturbing this okay so

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.360 
recommend hi perturbing this okay so
let's<00:04:24.150> go<00:04:24.270> back<00:04:24.479> to<00:04:24.690> the<00:04:25.010> creeping<00:04:26.010> fig<00:04:26.130> shader

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
let's go back to the creeping fig shader

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:33.500 
let's go back to the creeping fig shader
and<00:04:26.660> copy<00:04:27.660> these<00:04:27.900> leaves<00:04:31.669> and<00:04:32.669> we're<00:04:33.360> going<00:04:33.479> to

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
and copy these leaves and we're going to

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.719 
and copy these leaves and we're going to
paste<00:04:33.780> them<00:04:34.220> we're<00:04:35.220> just<00:04:35.310> going<00:04:35.460> to<00:04:35.520> plot

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:35.729 
paste them we're just going to plot

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:39.260 
paste them we're just going to plot
these<00:04:35.910> things<00:04:36.150> right<00:04:36.300> on<00:04:36.510> there<00:04:38.060> yeah<00:04:39.060> they

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
these things right on there yeah they

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.430 
these things right on there yeah they
look<00:04:39.389> a<00:04:39.510> little<00:04:39.630> big<00:04:40.190> let's<00:04:41.190> just<00:04:42.349> you<00:04:43.349> know

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
look a little big let's just you know

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.680 
look a little big let's just you know
reduce<00:04:43.830> it<00:04:44.010> here<00:04:44.340> like<00:04:44.760> just<00:04:45.060> me<00:04:45.240> about<00:04:45.479> half

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
reduce it here like just me about half

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:50.450 
reduce it here like just me about half
as<00:04:45.870> big<00:04:46.080> see<00:04:46.680> what<00:04:46.830> happens<00:04:48.650> all<00:04:49.650> right<00:04:49.800> now

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
as big see what happens all right now

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.250 
as big see what happens all right now
let's<00:04:50.639> just<00:04:50.759> do<00:04:50.849> a<00:04:50.880> quick<00:04:51.060> render<00:04:51.930> and<00:04:52.080> see

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
let's just do a quick render and see

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.439 
let's just do a quick render and see
what<00:04:52.410> we<00:04:52.500> got<00:04:52.729> okay<00:04:53.729> well<00:04:53.940> that's<00:04:54.120> our<00:04:54.240> first

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:54.449 
what we got okay well that's our first

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:56.480 
what we got okay well that's our first
render<00:04:54.810> pass<00:04:54.990> and<00:04:55.349> it<00:04:55.740> looks<00:04:55.949> like<00:04:56.039> the

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
render pass and it looks like the

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.670 
render pass and it looks like the
scalings<00:04:57.030> off<00:04:57.270> and<00:04:57.690> our<00:04:57.870> displacements<00:04:58.530> off

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
scalings off and our displacements off

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.100 
scalings off and our displacements off
so<00:04:59.070> I'll<00:04:59.820> let's<00:05:00.210> go<00:05:00.270> into<00:05:00.539> the<00:05:00.630> leaf<00:05:00.810> shader

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
so I'll let's go into the leaf shader

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:08.300 
so I'll let's go into the leaf shader
and<00:05:02.300> I'm<00:05:03.300> going<00:05:03.840> to<00:05:06.470> reduce<00:05:07.470> the<00:05:07.770> strength<00:05:08.099> of

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
and I'm going to reduce the strength of

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.980 
and I'm going to reduce the strength of
this<00:05:08.490> by<00:05:09.030> about<00:05:09.720> half<00:05:09.780> as<00:05:10.139> much<00:05:10.289> and<00:05:11.419> I<00:05:12.419> want<00:05:12.930> to

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
this by about half as much and I want to

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.520 
this by about half as much and I want to
go<00:05:13.080> back<00:05:13.260> into<00:05:13.500> this<00:05:14.419> tag<00:05:15.419> the<00:05:15.840> selection<00:05:16.289> tag

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
go back into this tag the selection tag

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:20.839 
go back into this tag the selection tag
and<00:05:18.320> reduce<00:05:19.320> this<00:05:19.680> these<00:05:20.190> leaves<00:05:20.490> even

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:20.849 
and reduce this these leaves even

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:28.250 
and reduce this these leaves even
further

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:28.260 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.290 

okay<00:05:29.260> so<00:05:29.320> that's<00:05:29.620> actually<00:05:30.130> not<00:05:30.490> too<00:05:30.970> bad<00:05:31.000> i

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.300 
okay so that's actually not too bad i

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.960 
okay so that's actually not too bad i
think<00:05:31.630> the<00:05:31.780> fig<00:05:32.470> leaves<00:05:32.710> are<00:05:32.980> pretty<00:05:33.460> much<00:05:33.760> in

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970 
think the fig leaves are pretty much in

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:37.460 
think the fig leaves are pretty much in
scale<00:05:34.270> with<00:05:35.310> you<00:05:36.310> know<00:05:36.430> the<00:05:36.580> rest<00:05:36.760> of<00:05:36.880> the

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.470 
scale with you know the rest of the

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:41.580 
scale with you know the rest of the
objects<00:05:38.470> in<00:05:38.530> the<00:05:38.650> scene<00:05:38.860> and<00:05:39.300> you<00:05:40.500> know<00:05:41.500> you

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590 
objects in the scene and you know you

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:42.870 
objects in the scene and you know you
can<00:05:41.770> dial<00:05:41.950> this<00:05:42.130> into<00:05:42.400> your<00:05:42.460> heart's<00:05:42.760> content

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 
can dial this into your heart's content

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.610 
can dial this into your heart's content
you<00:05:43.240> can<00:05:43.330> kind<00:05:43.600> of<00:05:43.690> you<00:05:43.840> know<00:05:43.870> just<00:05:44.230> the<00:05:44.440> outer

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 
you can kind of you know just the outer

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.200 
you can kind of you know just the outer
shell<00:05:45.010> so<00:05:45.400> that<00:05:45.430> it's<00:05:45.640> a<00:05:45.700> little<00:05:45.730> bit<00:05:45.940> tighter

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:46.210 
shell so that it's a little bit tighter

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.810 
shell so that it's a little bit tighter
a<00:05:46.570> little<00:05:47.440> bit<00:05:47.890> looser<00:05:48.040> or<00:05:48.430> you<00:05:48.640> could<00:05:48.790> just

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:48.820 
a little bit looser or you could just

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
a little bit looser or you could just
make<00:05:49.120> another<00:05:49.150> a<00:05:50.670> shell<00:05:51.670> and<00:05:51.970> you<00:05:52.450> could<00:05:52.630> like

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:52.840 
make another a shell and you could like

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.770 
make another a shell and you could like
flip<00:05:53.500> it<00:05:53.650> or<00:05:53.770> something<00:05:54.280> and<00:05:54.580> you<00:05:55.300> know<00:05:55.420> make

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:55.780 
flip it or something and you know make

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.210 
flip it or something and you know make
it<00:05:55.900> a<00:05:55.960> little<00:05:56.110> give<00:05:56.620> it<00:05:56.710> a<00:05:56.770> little<00:05:56.890> slightly

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:57.220 
it a little give it a little slightly

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:59.910 
it a little give it a little slightly
different<00:05:57.490> scale<00:05:57.820> and<00:05:58.090> it<00:05:58.900> will<00:05:58.990> add<00:05:59.200> more

00:05:59.910 --> 00:05:59.920 
different scale and it will add more

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.440 
different scale and it will add more
complexity<00:06:00.640> it'll<00:06:00.850> give<00:06:00.970> you<00:06:01.060> some<00:06:01.270> more

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:01.450 
complexity it'll give you some more

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:05.160 
complexity it'll give you some more
leaves<00:06:01.690> and<00:06:02.110> more<00:06:02.980> detail<00:06:03.370> and<00:06:04.050> you<00:06:05.050> know

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:05.170 
leaves and more detail and you know

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:08.010 
leaves and more detail and you know
there<00:06:05.440> you<00:06:05.560> go<00:06:05.740> it's<00:06:06.180> not<00:06:07.180> really<00:06:07.480> too<00:06:07.720> much

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:08.020 
there you go it's not really too much

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:12.210 
there you go it's not really too much
work<00:06:08.530> to<00:06:08.860> just<00:06:09.550> add<00:06:09.960> IV<00:06:10.960> or<00:06:11.230> creeping<00:06:11.740> figs<00:06:11.980> to

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:12.220 
work to just add IV or creeping figs to

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:15.390 
work to just add IV or creeping figs to
a<00:06:12.250> outdoor<00:06:12.850> structure<00:06:13.480> and<00:06:13.720> I<00:06:14.100> hope<00:06:15.100> you<00:06:15.250> like

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:15.400 
a outdoor structure and I hope you like

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.640 
a outdoor structure and I hope you like
