comes<00:02:25.890> out<00:02:26.069> pretty<00:02:26.609> average<00:02:26.760> 500<00:02:27.629> meters<00:02:27.930> per

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:32.809 
second I guess one of the drawbacks is
having<00:02:30.540> a<00:02:30.629> fast<00:02:30.870> fire<00:02:31.260> is<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.889> results<00:02:32.549> in

having a fast fire is the results in

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.300 
having a fast fire is the results in
quite<00:02:33.090> high<00:02:33.329> recoil<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:34.409> ACR<00:02:34.920> is<00:02:34.950> not<00:02:35.189> the

quite high recoil the ACR is not the

quite high recoil the ACR is not the

highest recoloring carbine but it's one

with quite heavy vertical kick if you

with quite heavy vertical kick if you

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
just pin the trigger you're gonna be

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.050 
just pin the trigger you're gonna be
shooting<00:02:43.079> about<00:02:43.500> five<00:02:43.859> meters<00:02:44.370> of<00:02:44.519> target<00:02:44.970> in

less than a second but one of the

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.589 
less than a second but one of the
benefits<00:02:47.129> of<00:02:47.310> a<00:02:47.400> fast<00:02:47.639> fire<00:02:47.970> rate<00:02:48.000> is<00:02:48.389> that

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:48.599 
benefits of a fast fire rate is that

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.750 
benefits of a fast fire rate is that
under<00:02:48.780> controlled<00:02:49.319> fire<00:02:49.709> you<00:02:50.280> can<00:02:50.430> get<00:02:50.579> those

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
under controlled fire you can get those

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.300 
under controlled fire you can get those
shots<00:02:51.030> out<00:02:51.299> in<00:02:51.450> a<00:02:51.540> much<00:02:51.720> tighter<00:02:51.989> spread<00:02:52.560> Plus

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
shots out in a much tighter spread Plus

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.830 
shots out in a much tighter spread Plus
this<00:02:53.430> weapon<00:02:53.790> becomes<00:02:53.939> extremely<00:02:54.689> more

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
this weapon becomes extremely more

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.659 
this weapon becomes extremely more
reliable<00:02:55.379> once<00:02:55.650> you<00:02:55.799> equip<00:02:56.159> some<00:02:56.430> of<00:02:56.549> those

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:56.669 
reliable once you equip some of those

00:02:56.669 --> 00:02:59.690

recoil taming attachments I seem to find

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.539 
recoil taming attachments I seem to find
that<00:02:59.819> the<00:03:00.060> muzzle<00:03:00.419> brake<00:03:00.689> plus<00:03:01.139> the<00:03:01.469> potato<00:03:02.159> or

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
that the muzzle brake plus the potato or

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.280 
that the muzzle brake plus the potato or
stubby<00:03:02.879> grip<00:03:02.909> really<00:03:03.180> helped<00:03:03.510> out<00:03:03.689> there<00:03:04.200> was

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
stubby grip really helped out there was

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.080 
stubby grip really helped out there was
a<00:03:04.319> break<00:03:04.560> officer<00:03:04.919> decreases<00:03:05.459> that<00:03:05.489> vertical

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
a break officer decreases that vertical

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.879 
a break officer decreases that vertical
recoil<00:03:06.239> while<00:03:06.840> the<00:03:07.109> stubby<00:03:07.439> grip<00:03:07.530> or<00:03:07.859> the

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290

in<00:03:10.680> recoil<00:03:11.099> under<00:03:11.549> automatic<00:03:12.239> fire<00:03:12.540> I<00:03:12.870> did

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
in recoil under automatic fire I did

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.199 
in recoil under automatic fire I did
find<00:03:13.739> that<00:03:13.799> this<00:03:14.010> type<00:03:14.219> of<00:03:14.250> grip<00:03:14.549> did<00:03:14.790> help<00:03:15.030> a

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
find that this type of grip did help a

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.000 
find that this type of grip did help a
lot<00:03:15.329> more<00:03:15.359> than<00:03:15.780> the<00:03:15.930> angled<00:03:16.379> grip<00:03:16.470> or<00:03:16.979> the

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
lot more than the angled grip or the

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.890 
lot more than the angled grip or the
folding<00:03:17.430> grip<00:03:17.519> which<00:03:17.790> reduces<00:03:18.329> your<00:03:18.510> first

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
folding grip which reduces your first

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.860 
folding grip which reduces your first
shot<00:03:19.349> recoil<00:03:19.500> by<00:03:19.889> much<00:03:20.099> more<00:03:20.370> at<00:03:20.519> 33%<00:03:21.090> but

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
shot recoil by much more at 33% but

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.330 
shot recoil by much more at 33% but
where<00:03:21.989> the<00:03:22.079> weapon<00:03:22.379> has<00:03:22.500> got<00:03:22.650> a<00:03:22.680> high<00:03:22.949> fire
