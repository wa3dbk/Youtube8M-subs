that<00:01:08.590> if<00:01:08.920> you're<00:01:09.490> going<00:01:09.520> to<00:01:09.640> tackle<00:01:09.910> a<00:01:10.090> subject

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:10.510 
that if you're going to tackle a subject

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.180 
that if you're going to tackle a subject
you<00:01:10.600> have<00:01:10.780> to<00:01:10.869> respect<00:01:10.990> the<00:01:11.320> subject<00:01:11.710> so<00:01:11.950> we

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.190 
you have to respect the subject so we

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:13.890 
you have to respect the subject so we
can't<00:01:12.369> just<00:01:12.520> do<00:01:13.000> a<00:01:13.030> facade<00:01:13.450> of<00:01:13.509> greek

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
can't just do a facade of greek

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:14.850 
can't just do a facade of greek
architecture<00:01:14.320> you<00:01:14.470> have<00:01:14.500> to<00:01:14.680> really

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:14.860 
architecture you have to really

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.550 
architecture you have to really
understand<00:01:15.400> what<00:01:16.090> are<00:01:16.270> the<00:01:16.479> proportions<00:01:16.780> how

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
understand what are the proportions how

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.460 
understand what are the proportions how
big<00:01:17.830> is<00:01:17.860> the<00:01:18.070> base<00:01:18.220> compared<00:01:18.700> to<00:01:18.790> a<00:01:18.820> column<00:01:19.270> and

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
big is the base compared to a column and

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.340 
big is the base compared to a column and
compared<00:01:20.470> to<00:01:20.560> the<00:01:20.649> top<00:01:20.830> of<00:01:21.009> it<00:01:22.229> there's<00:01:23.229> going

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
compared to the top of it there's going

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.680 
compared to the top of it there's going
to<00:01:23.410> be<00:01:23.440> things<00:01:23.710> like<00:01:24.149> Cyclops's<00:01:25.149> Minotaur

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
to be things like Cyclops's Minotaur

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.330 
to be things like Cyclops's Minotaur
things<00:01:25.720> that<00:01:26.170> you've<00:01:26.320> seen<00:01:26.500> in<00:01:26.560> other<00:01:26.950> god<00:01:27.220> of

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
things that you've seen in other god of

things that you've seen in other god of
war<00:01:27.460> games<00:01:27.670> and<00:01:27.910> we<00:01:27.970> want<00:01:28.149> to<00:01:28.300> make<00:01:28.360> sure<00:01:28.479> that

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
war games and we want to make sure that

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.660 
war games and we want to make sure that
we<00:01:29.020> were<00:01:29.200> faithful<00:01:29.950> to<00:01:30.130> that<00:01:30.160> type<00:01:30.640> of

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
we were faithful to that type of

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.850 
we were faithful to that type of
mythology<00:01:31.240> of<00:01:31.750> course<00:01:31.990> there's<00:01:32.290> always<00:01:32.500> a

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
mythology of course there's always a

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.249 
mythology of course there's always a
slight<00:01:33.399> twist<00:01:33.670> or<00:01:33.850> spin<00:01:34.090> that<00:01:34.479> will<00:01:34.720> put<00:01:35.140> on

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
slight twist or spin that will put on

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:36.780 
slight twist or spin that will put on
things<00:01:35.470> to<00:01:35.680> make<00:01:35.830> them<00:01:35.890> you<00:01:36.280> know<00:01:36.399> bigger

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
things to make them you know bigger

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.510 
things to make them you know bigger
better<00:01:37.210> than<00:01:37.479> then<00:01:38.110> they<00:01:38.320> may<00:01:38.649> be<00:01:39.040> represented

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
better than then they may be represented

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.270 
better than then they may be represented
in<00:01:39.720> traditional<00:01:40.720> mythology

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.120 

I<00:01:44.340> look<00:01:45.180> at<00:01:45.270> archetypes<00:01:45.810> these<00:01:46.590> recurring

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
I look at archetypes these recurring

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.070 
I look at archetypes these recurring
themes<00:01:47.460> in<00:01:47.729> humans<00:01:48.090> storytelling<00:01:48.720> what's<00:01:48.960> the

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
themes in humans storytelling what's the

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.190 
themes in humans storytelling what's the
most<00:01:49.229> efficient<00:01:49.830> way<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:50.600> to<00:01:51.600> communicate

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
most efficient way to to communicate

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.109 
most efficient way to to communicate
this<00:01:52.409> for<00:01:53.009> example<00:01:53.369> if<00:01:53.549> someone<00:01:53.580> has<00:01:54.000> to

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
this for example if someone has to

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.760 
this for example if someone has to
represent<00:01:54.240> death<00:01:54.690> what<00:01:55.170> do<00:01:55.259> you<00:01:55.320> need<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.590> put

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
represent death what do you need to put

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.350 
represent death what do you need to put
in<00:01:55.920> there<00:01:56.159> in<00:01:56.340> order<00:01:56.729> for<00:01:56.940> him<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.090> look<00:01:57.299> like

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
in there in order for him to look like

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.649 
in there in order for him to look like
that<00:01:57.770> olivia<00:01:58.770> has<00:01:58.860> sent<00:01:59.159> a<00:01:59.250> message<00:01:59.670> and<00:01:59.880> i<00:02:00.180> am

requirements of a game like Ottawa we

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
as much as the first one helped us to

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.300 
as much as the first one helped us to
start<00:03:31.080> on<00:03:31.260> you<00:03:31.410> know<00:03:31.500> the<00:03:31.650> foundations<00:03:32.130> of<00:03:32.190> a

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
start on you know the foundations of a

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:33.860 
start on you know the foundations of a
game<00:03:32.460> the<00:03:32.640> second<00:03:33.000> one<00:03:33.090> will<00:03:33.330> really<00:03:33.600> really

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
game the second one will really really

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.600 
game the second one will really really
show<00:03:34.200> people<00:03:34.230> a<00:03:34.740> few<00:03:35.190> things<00:03:35.340> that<00:03:35.460> this

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
show people a few things that this

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.340 
show people a few things that this
hardware<00:03:35.970> is<00:03:36.030> able<00:03:36.210> to<00:03:36.330> do<00:03:36.450> and<00:03:36.690> I<00:03:36.900> believe

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
hardware is able to do and I believe

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.530 
hardware is able to do and I believe
right<00:03:37.380> now<00:03:37.680> I'm<00:03:38.070> very<00:03:38.580> proud<00:03:38.790> to<00:03:38.940> say<00:03:39.060> that<00:03:39.090> the

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
right now I'm very proud to say that the

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.300 
right now I'm very proud to say that the
guys<00:03:39.690> you<00:03:39.870> actually<00:03:40.170> would<00:03:40.290> they<00:03:40.920> have<00:03:41.010> pulled

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
guys you actually would they have pulled

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.160 
guys you actually would they have pulled
off<00:03:41.430> probably<00:03:41.700> with<00:03:41.940> the<00:03:42.480> best<00:03:42.660> technology<00:03:42.750> on

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
off probably with the best technology on

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:50.080 
off probably with the best technology on
PSP<00:03:43.530> that's<00:03:43.770> available<00:03:43.950> right<00:03:44.190> now

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.520 

ultimately<00:03:51.090> the<00:03:51.390> game<00:03:51.600> is<00:03:51.780> about<00:03:51.930> brutal

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
ultimately the game is about brutal

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.410 
ultimately the game is about brutal
combat<00:03:52.800> and<00:03:53.340> the<00:03:53.610> team<00:03:53.790> wanted<00:03:54.090> to<00:03:54.210> make<00:03:54.390> sure

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420

the PSP controls from the ps2 version

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.980 
the PSP controls from the ps2 version
was<00:03:59.670> a<00:03:59.700> challenging<00:04:00.150> task<00:04:00.330> but<00:04:00.660> it's<00:04:00.780> not<00:04:00.900> an

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:00.990 
was a challenging task but it's not an

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
impossible task we just had to really

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.910 
impossible task we just had to really
approach<00:04:02.910> in<00:04:03.120> a<00:04:03.270> very<00:04:03.480> simple<00:04:03.960> manner<00:04:04.110> go<00:04:04.860> to

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:13.020 
from the analog which which I think

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.570

would<00:04:13.080> be<00:04:13.200> natural<00:04:13.470> for<00:04:13.710> people<00:04:13.860> to<00:04:14.130> do<00:04:14.250> now

the<00:04:20.220> very<00:04:20.460> first<00:04:20.640> day<00:04:20.760> felt<00:04:21.450> a<00:04:21.570> little<00:04:21.750> awkward

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:21.960

but<00:04:22.770> I<00:04:23.100> think<00:04:23.400> it<00:04:23.490> took<00:04:23.580> us<00:04:23.730> about<00:04:23.910> a<00:04:24.090> week<00:04:24.330> to

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
but I think it took us about a week to

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.780 
but I think it took us about a week to
really<00:04:24.990> know<00:04:25.530> play<00:04:25.830> more<00:04:26.220> and<00:04:26.400> more<00:04:26.580> and

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
really know play more and more and

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:28.400 
really know play more and more and

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
realize that it was he came to us

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.200

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
big group for example because at the end

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.960 
big group for example because at the end
of<00:05:22.080> that<00:05:22.199> move<00:05:22.440> you<00:05:23.190> end<00:05:23.460> up<00:05:23.580> in<00:05:23.669> a<00:05:23.759> very

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:23.970 
of that move you end up in a very

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.240 
of that move you end up in a very
vulnerable<00:05:24.150> position<00:05:24.509> and<00:05:25.139> what<00:05:25.830> we<00:05:25.979> wanted

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
vulnerable position and what we wanted

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:27.680

to give with that was a tactic a

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:32.689 
to give with that was a tactic a
strategy<00:05:28.289> to<00:05:28.320> use<00:05:28.440> that<00:05:30.680> the<00:05:31.680> puzzles<00:05:32.070> in<00:05:32.310> god

element of the gameplay there's a lot of
action<00:05:36.720> and<00:05:36.990> we<00:05:37.229> need<00:05:37.349> to<00:05:37.440> break<00:05:37.680> up<00:05:37.710> some<00:05:38.160> of

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.190 
action and we need to break up some of

action and we need to break up some of
that<00:05:38.370> with<00:05:38.669> some<00:05:38.820> downtime<00:05:39.240> and<00:05:39.509> one<00:05:39.690> of<00:05:39.780> the
