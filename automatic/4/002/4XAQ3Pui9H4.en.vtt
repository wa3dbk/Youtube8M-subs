00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.160
 in this video blog let's say what will happen with 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.069
 telephone if expert anniversary 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.069
 trivia after a year of use 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:13.119
 it's already old 

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:14.779
 at the request of the investor 

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:17.210
 a sticker the baptist saved him from many 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.199
 troubles 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.960
 this sticker is more than a year on 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.090
 tv channel 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.150
 but looks 40 feet 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.920
 one of the first reasons to buy troika 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:27.960
 sticker 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.839
 there was protection from scratches and rare 

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:30.769
 the fall 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:32.840
 but it is not forgetting about me too 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.810
 attract cheneva 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.810
 so let's get started 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.090
 remove the upper part 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:43.900
 front panels 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.900
 on the cry and it was already the fact that Ukraine 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.420
 the bottom is also easily removed 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.830
 half vinyl stickers 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.120
 disown 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.100
 wipe with a cloth and the screen does not remain 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.100
 no trace 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.440
 now no one will guess what is here 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.810
 baltic 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.810
 and still a button left 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.990
 that's all from the screen we finished 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:18.790
 let's have a decent backside 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.170
 phone 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.450
 it will be a little more difficult 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.700
 as the rear 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.530
 iphone side these stickers 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:30.600
 fastens 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.180
 more 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.960
 strong 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.340
 First, let's start tamping the sticker with 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.340
 all sides 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.230
 stuck tight 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:45.220
 by the way try to remove 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.620
 a sticker so that I'm not very strong 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.480
 damage that can be again 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.480
 stickers 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.650
 how do you see the stickers very much 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:03.830
 elderly 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.000
 but when you shoot them on the phone 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 nothing remains 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:12.589
 So 

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:14.389
 at 

00:02:14.389 --> 00:02:16.199
 So 

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:19.199
 as 

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:22.929
 to 

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:28.219
 there 

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:30.629
 So 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:32.439
 as 

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:34.819
 as 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.209
 now we have like small stock 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.709
 Kirov's accuracy stickers fulfilled their 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.349
 task 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:44.299
 the phone is not fast lords 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:47.639
 and not damaged 

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:48.409

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:50.809

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:53.779
 eye 

00:02:53.779 --> 00:02:56.899
 here is the foundation of our region 

00:02:56.899 --> 00:02:59.049
 This is how it became when we got up 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:00.269
 funny 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.709
 but it was all different 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.709
 Here he was a year ago 

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:09.279
 to such he began to look what 

00:03:09.279 --> 00:03:12.279
