00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.250
 yves aillerie hi everyone knows 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.520
 flair and we find ourselves today for 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.690
 a second of medium play yeah I confess 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.600
 that I did not expect so much at 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:21.640
 you let go of that a second 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.320
 a second case even as you like 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.360
 you can forgive you doubt it cisse 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.200
 on the timra chain I have it is that 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.570
 it is a cellar m 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.890
 so small peculiarity of the coup 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.570
 than this one compared to the previous 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.719
 already I was during hardcore I was in 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.069
 normal domination and in addition to that 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:37.480
 I was solo ie who had 

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:39.429
 nobody really really really 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.890
 no one in the team to help me and 

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:44.140
 I had no support at all 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.519
 I did not have a jacket there 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.190
 maybe it was like that, I think 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:49.839
 that there was oracle but I really 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.909
 if they did not have much to 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:54.339
 help me more than that it's not bad rage 

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:55.569
 especially about the end of the game where 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:58.030
 I dropped my cam I will do 

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:59.649
 only a kill I believe because the 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.210
 majority of players have all left the 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:02.199
 part 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.659
 so here I am going to talk to you a little 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:08.020
 little of this gold rush card so who 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:09.579
 is simply the rush 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.710
 gold is actually translation 

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:12.759
 literal in English that's all 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.840
 just the gold rush then 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:16.119
 what is it is a mine in 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.979
 does it's a card that is very 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:19.810
 opened 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.039
 it's not easy to manage because 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.570
 it can really happen to all the senses 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:23.950
 the canche you are for example where I 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.130
 am on the map 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.390
 it can happen 2b which is above that 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.770
 can happen from dairy to sus not 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.479
 dreamed of the right of the left at the same 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.619
 time so it can happen a lot 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:33.700
 of places same time it is true that he 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.700
 must open the eye 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.840
 those who do not have a helmet will have 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.700
 a little trouble what they have to because a 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.979
 helmet pardon are really advantaged 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.679
 because we still hear and we 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.240
 gets to situate people with their 

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:48.520
 footsteps because there are a lot of 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.320
 right teeth or actually when you 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.670
 hear people market presenting 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.950
 footsteps on wood as if they 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.350
 were walking on logical boards and 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.579
 so it allows you to locate 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.539
 quite easily people when you 

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:00.039
 know the map 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:01.119
 when I did not know her enough 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:02.859
 well but I realized that 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.840
 wooden planks are not 

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:06.490
 two floors ie if you 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.960
 know where they are located you arrive 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.429
 to locate the stage and in this case you 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.280
 will come to know where are the enemies 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.650
 precisely 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.970
 so here is a good little map 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.170
 the cars by cons it must be done 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.340
 attention because there are some 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.810
 a few who like to put themselves 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.250
 in it but for now that 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.140
 I saw that is reasonable 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.050
 This is not say that when not even 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.250
 in no longer what so for now 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.890
 yeah it's going at the community level 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.709
 there are a lot of good reactions 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.959
 on the other hand the package that m finally I know 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.700
 not if you've already seen it if you had 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:37.410
 already seen what was doing the package that has 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.580
 even finally me I think it just abused 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.980
 I mean earlier I did 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.320
 I have so much domination to arcore I was 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.180
 with other people I was with 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.720
 people this time we were three 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.830
 in all I queued m to 20 he 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.350
 sincerely triple or it's just 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.910
 abused what is it's ultra boring you 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.019
 move and series k way but then what 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.510
 what I'm doing I'm forced to 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.160
 put in a corner tried to kill the 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.019
 wolves before that kills me I mean the 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.360
 wolf is finally not not even 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:05.280
 luz made a kind of coyote 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.209
 finally just I did not see the look 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.040
 but I have the impression that he is a 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.450
 little bit darker than the wolf so 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.360
 it's not quite the same skin 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.769
 still do not see what I told you 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.030
 there are some who use the 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:16.380
 wagon from time to time but it stays 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.850
 reasonable you see in the part I 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.959
 do not go cross-bred that much so 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.720
 as I said yeah it's kind 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:24.360
 coyote 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.680
 good this they finally look it takes 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.160
 as many bullets as the wolves for the 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.410
 kill on the other hand have me there they look 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.269
 less aggressive in the direction below ben 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.040
 I have the impression that they shop a little 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.380
 less than wolves than dogs 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.630
 they will not make you a dive of 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:42.630
 the death that kills on you finally me in 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.459
 anyway the skin I crossed them there 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.049
 was he had as many lives as the 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.630
 dogs and they jumped from far away 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:49.769
 so I managed to kill them in hardcore 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.630
 but I was really lucky 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:53.609
 and I do not know if you should not even 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:55.859
 maybe that puts you several shots 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:59.790
 finally I do not know it's really worth seeing 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:04:01.440
 but it looks a bit boring, but that's it 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.190
 reasonable wages - shit wages 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.830
 and that the 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.170
 dog so that's how I said to 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:10.710
 those who hesitate to take 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:12.360
 this famous nemesis pack if you are 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.170
 performant player sincerely I can 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.750
 that you advise 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:18.269
 because that's really what it is 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.790
 I call cards acca m then less 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.410
 this one puts ten nations the occurrence 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.610
 it's a map to ko m 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.470
 what I call a current map 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.980
 it's a map actually simple to 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.260
 understand 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.670
 if you will understand easily 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.460
 functioning you will find 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:34.530
 easily start spam actually 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.080
 as soon as you started playing on 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.550
 his cards you're going you're not going 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.080
 have too much trouble understanding 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.740
 how do it work and to know 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.000
 houston the enemies and that's good and 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.960
 not well at the same time ie 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.360
 you have as many chances of you 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.640
 blame themselves than to put 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.810
 one after all depends on who 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.970
 play against whom you play 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.560
 but I mean I still managed 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.820
 to let go of two cases m 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:01.110
 in two days on two cards 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:03.540
 different down below in about 24 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.700
 hours of play on the dlc by 24 hours 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:08.520
 of play we'll say in 24 hours because 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:12.090
 I had the delays it's about yesterday 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.110
 around wadi 13 14 hours there at 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.520
 when I recommend this video 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.600
 it's 2 pm I already managed to 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.820
 make 2 km on two different maps 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:20.550
 which one in solo so I mean it's 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.990
 not very complicated what and I 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.910
 think in the coming days 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:26.700
 you will surely see very very 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:28.230
 big performances on his cards though 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.740
 it's not double maybe triple 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:30.690
 case m 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.760
 not necessarily on the chain of rabies 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:36.180
 I would love it would be great but 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:38.160
 but here we are on the end my 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.750
 little cream unlock on this friends 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.760
 I tell you next time actually for 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:44.010
 a video maybe strong and klm on 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:45.660
 another of the cards that would be good and 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.310
 I'll see you soon you'll see the 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.690
 klm unfortunately she will fart and I 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:50.070
 I'll do one little thing tomorrow 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.840
 because they will have all schuss rage 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:56.419
 quit forgiveness on this I tell you to the 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.419
 next by jove
