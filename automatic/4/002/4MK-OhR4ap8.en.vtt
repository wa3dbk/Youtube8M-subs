00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.210 

this<00:04:02.270> is<00:04:02.450> so<00:04:02.599> see<00:04:02.780> people<00:04:03.140> from<00:04:03.380> from<00:04:03.920> the<00:04:04.069> air

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
this is so see people from from the air

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.740 
this is so see people from from the air
15<00:04:05.170> expensive<00:04:06.170> to<00:04:06.260> shoot

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:12.170 

and<00:04:09.930> then<00:04:10.350> eventually<00:04:10.470> down<00:04:11.280> the<00:04:11.400> road<00:04:11.610> you

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
and then eventually down the road you

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.930 
and then eventually down the road you
can<00:04:12.210> ban<00:04:12.810> the<00:04:12.960> whole<00:04:13.110> thing<00:04:13.400> or<00:04:14.400> these<00:04:14.700> spent

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
can ban the whole thing or these spent

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.509 
can ban the whole thing or these spent
parts<00:04:15.270> of<00:04:15.360> it<00:04:15.480> incrementally<00:04:16.440> over<00:04:16.799> time<00:04:17.190> and

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
parts of it incrementally over time and

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.340 
parts of it incrementally over time and
then<00:04:17.640> BAM<00:04:17.910> the<00:04:17.940> whole<00:04:18.180> thing<00:04:18.420> if<00:04:19.049> you<00:04:19.140> have<00:04:19.230> the

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
then BAM the whole thing if you have the

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.700 
then BAM the whole thing if you have the
thing<00:04:19.500> of<00:04:19.620> this<00:04:19.739> and<00:04:19.920> the<00:04:19.980> collective<00:04:20.400> people

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:21.710 
thing of this and the collective people

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:24.350 
thing of this and the collective people
we<00:04:22.710> don't<00:04:22.830> think<00:04:23.070> like<00:04:23.250> this<00:04:23.400> because<00:04:23.820> we're

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
we don't think like this because we're

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.480 
we don't think like this because we're
rational<00:04:24.900> people<00:04:25.050> we<00:04:25.530> have<00:04:25.890> things<00:04:26.220> to<00:04:26.310> do

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
rational people we have things to do

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.940 
rational people we have things to do
responsibilities<00:04:27.450> we<00:04:27.540> have<00:04:27.570> jobs<00:04:27.900> and<00:04:28.890> we

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:28.950 
responsibilities we have jobs and we

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.010 
responsibilities we have jobs and we
don't<00:04:29.280> have<00:04:29.790> time<00:04:30.120> to<00:04:30.390> sit<00:04:30.570> around<00:04:30.690> and<00:04:30.960> think

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
don't have time to sit around and think

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.380 
don't have time to sit around and think
about<00:04:31.320> how<00:04:31.500> we<00:04:31.560> can<00:04:31.830> get<00:04:32.700> rid<00:04:32.910> of<00:04:32.940> things<00:04:33.180> we

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.390 
about how we can get rid of things we

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.200 
about how we can get rid of things we
don't<00:04:33.480> like<00:04:33.650> in<00:04:34.650> society<00:04:34.890> like<00:04:35.610> these<00:04:35.910> people

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
don't like in society like these people

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.800 
don't like in society like these people
do

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
do

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.610 
do
so

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.500 

you<00:04:41.100> have<00:04:41.220> to<00:04:41.340> think<00:04:41.490> of<00:04:41.639> it<00:04:41.760> in<00:04:41.940> terms<00:04:42.150> of<00:04:42.449> the

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
you have to think of it in terms of the

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:46.340 
you have to think of it in terms of the
long-term<00:04:42.750> legacy<00:04:43.490> that<00:04:44.490> they<00:04:44.990> want<00:04:45.990> they

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
long-term legacy that they want they

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.439 
long-term legacy that they want they
want<00:04:46.500> to<00:04:46.590> achieve<00:04:46.740> they<00:04:47.699> want<00:04:47.910> to<00:04:48.000> ban<00:04:48.180> this

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:48.449 
want to achieve they want to ban this

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:51.680 
want to achieve they want to ban this
and<00:04:48.830> the<00:04:49.830> first<00:04:50.130> step<00:04:50.430> is<00:04:50.970> driving<00:04:51.449> the<00:04:51.510> price

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
and the first step is driving the price

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.250 
and the first step is driving the price
of<00:04:51.870> ammunition<00:04:52.139> up<00:04:53.600> there<00:04:54.600> are<00:04:54.690> lots<00:04:54.930> of<00:04:55.020> other

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
of ammunition up there are lots of other

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.700 
of ammunition up there are lots of other
reasons<00:04:55.290> why<00:04:55.650> banning<00:04:56.460> the<00:04:57.139> XMB<00:04:58.139> five-five

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
reasons why banning the XMB five-five

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.689 
reasons why banning the XMB five-five
round<00:04:59.010> part<00:04:59.340> is<00:04:59.520> just<00:04:59.729> completely<00:05:00.120> bad<00:05:00.449> to<00:05:00.660> do

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:01.699 
round part is just completely bad to do

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:03.800 
round part is just completely bad to do
and<00:05:02.699> if<00:05:02.850> you<00:05:02.970> want<00:05:03.150> to<00:05:03.210> see<00:05:03.330> those<00:05:03.540> there's
