all of my edits so I assume just edit
this<00:04:29.139> one<00:04:29.440> because<00:04:29.530> I<00:04:29.650> haven't<00:04:29.800> edited<00:04:30.039> this

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
this one because I haven't edited this

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.870 
this one because I haven't edited this
one<00:04:30.580> yet<00:04:30.760> so<00:04:31.289> you<00:04:32.289> can<00:04:32.770> like<00:04:32.949> pick<00:04:33.400> a<00:04:33.610> different

I'm<00:04:38.830> using<00:04:38.889> right<00:04:39.400> now<00:04:39.460> is<00:04:39.639> the<00:04:40.180> m3<00:04:40.900> and<00:04:41.350> it

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
I'm using right now is the m3 and it

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.659 
I'm using right now is the m3 and it
just<00:04:42.400> makes<00:04:42.610> this<00:04:42.820> cool<00:04:43.180> effect<00:04:44.310> and<00:04:45.310> you<00:04:45.520> can

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
just makes this cool effect and you can

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:48.840 
just makes this cool effect and you can
also<00:04:45.850> go<00:04:46.270> and<00:04:46.539> you<00:04:46.630> can<00:04:46.810> like<00:04:47.520> turn<00:04:48.520> up<00:04:48.699> the

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
also go and you can like turn up the

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.430 
also go and you can like turn up the
contrast<00:04:49.419> and<00:04:50.200> turn<00:04:51.190> it<00:04:51.310> down<00:04:51.990> and<00:04:52.990> then<00:04:53.320> you

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
contrast and turn it down and then you

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.290 
contrast and turn it down and then you
can<00:04:53.590> do<00:04:53.770> temperature<00:04:55.950> exposure<00:04:56.950> and<00:04:57.639> then<00:04:57.910> I

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
can do temperature exposure and then I

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.100 
can do temperature exposure and then I
mostly<00:04:58.840> use<00:04:58.960> fade<00:05:00.090> and<00:05:01.090> you<00:05:01.539> can<00:05:01.690> like<00:05:01.840> do

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
mostly use fade and you can like do

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.339 
mostly use fade and you can like do
shadows<00:05:02.710> save<00:05:03.450> it<00:05:04.450> just<00:05:04.570> makes<00:05:04.810> it<00:05:04.960> I<00:05:05.020> think<00:05:05.169> it

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:05.349 
shadows save it just makes it I think it

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:07.830 
shadows save it just makes it I think it
makes<00:05:05.470> it<00:05:05.650> lighter<00:05:05.889> like<00:05:06.490> this<00:05:06.669> next<00:05:07.210> stop<00:05:07.450> I

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
makes it lighter like this next stop I

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.800 
makes it lighter like this next stop I
have<00:05:08.530> is<00:05:08.800> picsart<00:05:09.430> and<00:05:09.789> I<00:05:10.000> just<00:05:10.240> use<00:05:10.419> it<00:05:10.599> for

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
have is picsart and I just use it for

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:18.080 
have is picsart and I just use it for
collages<00:05:11.680> and<00:05:12.039> then<00:05:12.910> I<00:05:12.940> have<00:05:13.150> a<00:05:13.180> VAR<00:05:13.539> e

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:25.830 

and<00:05:19.090> I<00:05:19.720> use<00:05:20.020> a<00:05:20.050> VAR<00:05:20.680> e<00:05:21.840> 2<00:05:22.840> I<00:05:24.420> don't<00:05:25.420> use<00:05:25.630> a<00:05:25.660> lot

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 
and I use a VAR e 2 I don't use a lot

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:29.520 
and I use a VAR e 2 I don't use a lot
but<00:05:26.260> I<00:05:26.320> use<00:05:26.560> it<00:05:26.740> to<00:05:26.770> focus<00:05:27.460> pictures<00:05:28.290> like<00:05:29.290> make

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:29.530 
but I use it to focus pictures like make

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:31.800 
but I use it to focus pictures like make
it<00:05:29.710> blurred<00:05:29.950> in<00:05:30.190> the<00:05:30.280> background<00:05:30.790> like<00:05:31.690> it

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810 
it blurred in the background like it

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.220 
it blurred in the background like it
gets<00:05:31.960> blurry<00:05:32.350> in<00:05:32.650> the<00:05:32.740> background<00:05:33.190> and<00:05:34.150> then<00:05:34.930> I

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:35.230 
gets blurry in the background and then I

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:36.810 
gets blurry in the background and then I
just<00:05:35.530> I<00:05:35.800> don't<00:05:35.920> really<00:05:36.190> use<00:05:36.490> this<00:05:36.640> one<00:05:36.790> because

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:36.820 
just I don't really use this one because

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.850 
just I don't really use this one because
I<00:05:37.030> just<00:05:37.270> got<00:05:37.480> it<00:05:37.660> so<00:05:37.930> I<00:05:37.960> haven't<00:05:38.200> really<00:05:38.470> tried
