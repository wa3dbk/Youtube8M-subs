and also the single place BT 17 this
airplane<00:00:26.580> you<00:00:27.000> were<00:00:27.119> telling<00:00:27.480> me<00:00:27.510> is<00:00:27.930> about

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
airplane you were telling me is about

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.529 
airplane you were telling me is about
the<00:00:28.470> same<00:00:28.920> as<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.580> old<00:00:29.609> Grumman<00:00:30.150> American

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
the same as the old Grumman American

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:31.880 
the same as the old Grumman American
Yankee<00:00:31.019> which<00:00:31.199> was<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.410> airplane<00:00:31.650> that<00:00:31.740> I

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
Yankee which was the airplane that I

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.709 
Yankee which was the airplane that I
learned<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.250> fly<00:00:32.369> and<00:00:32.669> so<00:00:32.820> that<00:00:32.969> makes<00:00:33.149> it<00:00:33.300> kind

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
learned to fly and so that makes it kind

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.180 
learned to fly and so that makes it kind
of<00:00:33.750> a<00:00:33.960> special<00:00:34.290> place<00:00:34.410> in<00:00:34.530> my<00:00:34.800> heart

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
of a special place in my heart

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.190 
of a special place in my heart
tell<00:00:35.550> us<00:00:35.700> what's<00:00:35.910> different<00:00:36.420> between<00:00:36.570> this

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
tell us what's different between this

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.350 
tell us what's different between this
airplane<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:37.620> that<00:00:37.890> one<00:00:38.010> well<00:00:38.700> this<00:00:38.969> one<00:00:39.149> does

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
airplane and that one well this one does

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.930 
airplane and that one well this one does
have<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.600> same<00:00:39.899> honeycomb<00:00:40.350> design<00:00:40.940> basically

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
have the same honeycomb design basically

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.970 
have the same honeycomb design basically
about<00:00:42.180> six<00:00:42.629> years<00:00:42.809> ago<00:00:43.170> they<00:00:43.440> came<00:00:43.620> out<00:00:43.770> with<00:00:43.890> a

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
about six years ago they came out with a

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.130 
about six years ago they came out with a
two-part<00:00:44.430> adhesive<00:00:45.030> that<00:00:45.239> allowed<00:00:45.930> you<00:00:46.110> to

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
two-part adhesive that allowed you to

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:47.569 
two-part adhesive that allowed you to
bond<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.530> honeycomb<00:00:46.920> again<00:00:47.190> instead<00:00:47.460> of

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
bond the honeycomb again instead of

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:48.950 
bond the honeycomb again instead of
having<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.879> bake<00:00:48.090> it<00:00:48.270> like<00:00:48.420> they<00:00:48.539> do<00:00:48.600> with<00:00:48.809> the

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
having to bake it like they do with the

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.709 
having to bake it like they do with the
Yankee<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:50.070> product<00:00:50.550> itself<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:51.270> more

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
Yankee the product itself is more

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.200 
Yankee the product itself is more
expensive<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.350> honeycomb<00:00:52.800> sheets<00:00:53.160> but<00:00:53.940> for

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
expensive the honeycomb sheets but for

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.150 
expensive the honeycomb sheets but for
instance<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:54.690> can<00:00:54.870> bond<00:00:55.110> this<00:00:55.289> fuselage<00:00:55.860> in

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
instance you can bond this fuselage in

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.310 
instance you can bond this fuselage in
15<00:00:56.610> minutes<00:00:56.940> in<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.030> fixture<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.899> cost<00:00:58.170> the

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
15 minutes in the fixture the cost the

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.599 
15 minutes in the fixture the cost the
materials<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.770> little<00:00:58.890> bit<00:00:59.070> more<00:00:59.280> but<00:00:59.460> in<00:00:59.550> the

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
materials a little bit more but in the

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.580 
materials a little bit more but in the
labor<00:00:59.789> side<00:01:00.120> it's<00:01:00.449> extremely<00:01:00.840> fast<00:01:01.020> now<00:01:01.469> is

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
labor side it's extremely fast now is

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.070 
labor side it's extremely fast now is
this<00:01:01.680> an<00:01:01.829> LSA<00:01:02.219> this<00:01:02.670> one<00:01:02.879> is<00:01:03.000> an<00:01:03.120> LSA<00:01:03.570> we're

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
this an LSA this one is an LSA we're

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.140 
this an LSA this one is an LSA we're
also<00:01:04.199> gonna<00:01:04.379> use<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.680> same<00:01:04.949> fuselage<00:01:05.760> for<00:01:06.030> our

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
also gonna use the same fuselage for our

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.880 
also gonna use the same fuselage for our
to<00:01:06.299> place<00:01:06.540> down<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.930> road<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.439> four<00:01:07.650> place

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
to place down the road and a four place

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.920 
to place down the road and a four place
version<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.460> then<00:01:09.119> you've<00:01:09.299> got<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.600> single

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
version and then you've got the single

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.630 
version and then you've got the single
place<00:01:10.110> airplane<00:01:10.530> which<00:01:10.710> was<00:01:10.860> back<00:01:11.100> behind<00:01:11.310> us

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
place airplane which was back behind us

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.730

aviation world
well<00:01:16.140> original<00:01:16.799> concepts<00:01:17.310> on<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.490> single

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
well original concepts on the single

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.359 
well original concepts on the single
place<00:01:18.150> was<00:01:18.479> that<00:01:18.780> airplane<00:01:19.500> sells<00:01:19.860> for<00:01:20.130> thirty

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
place was that airplane sells for thirty

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.490 
place was that airplane sells for thirty
four<00:01:20.939> thousand<00:01:21.420> dollars<00:01:21.659> with<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:21.869> sixty<00:01:22.290> horse

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
four thousand dollars with a sixty horse

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.499 
four thousand dollars with a sixty horse
HKS<00:01:23.100> engine<00:01:23.460> we<00:01:23.939> thought<00:01:24.210> it<00:01:24.299> would<00:01:24.390> be<00:01:24.479> a

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
HKS engine we thought it would be a

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.510 
HKS engine we thought it would be a
great<00:01:24.810> concept<00:01:25.320> for<00:01:25.439> maybe<00:01:25.710> two<00:01:25.979> guys<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.369> go

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
great concept for maybe two guys to go

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.070 
great concept for maybe two guys to go
in<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.820> partnership<00:01:27.330> with<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.689> build<00:01:27.840> time

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
in and partnership with and build time

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.050 
in and partnership with and build time
with<00:01:28.290> it<00:01:28.470> burns<00:01:29.009> three<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.430> half<00:01:29.520> gallons

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
with it burns three and a half gallons

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.539 
with it burns three and a half gallons
of<00:01:30.150> fuel<00:01:30.329> on<00:01:30.659> that<00:01:30.689> HKS<00:01:31.320> engine<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:32.040> cruises<00:01:32.460> at

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
of fuel on that HKS engine it cruises at

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.060 
of fuel on that HKS engine it cruises at
130<00:01:33.060> miles<00:01:33.270> an<00:01:33.450> hour<00:01:33.630> so<00:01:34.439> we<00:01:34.740> just<00:01:34.890> thought

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
130 miles an hour so we just thought

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.980 
130 miles an hour so we just thought
it'd<00:01:35.189> be<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.369> great<00:01:35.610> fun<00:01:36.329> airplane<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:36.869> go

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
it'd be a great fun airplane to go

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.630 
it'd be a great fun airplane to go
around<00:01:37.290> it's<00:01:37.560> fast<00:01:37.860> enough<00:01:38.189> where<00:01:38.400> you<00:01:38.460> can<00:01:38.549> go

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
around it's fast enough where you can go

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.370 
around it's fast enough where you can go
somewhere<00:01:38.909> if<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.119> want<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.600> but<00:01:39.990> that<00:01:40.170> was

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
somewhere if you want to but that was

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.380 
somewhere if you want to but that was
the<00:01:40.560> original<00:01:40.680> concept<00:01:41.009> behind<00:01:41.400> that<00:01:41.579> 17<00:01:42.180> and

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
the original concept behind that 17 and

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.719 
the original concept behind that 17 and
then<00:01:43.140> this<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.740> two-place<00:01:44.130> airplane<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.670> the

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
then this the two-place airplane and the

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.130 
then this the two-place airplane and the
bigger<00:01:44.939> ones<00:01:45.149> you'll<00:01:45.570> look<00:01:45.689> more<00:01:45.960> at<00:01:46.049> the

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
bigger ones you'll look more at the

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.649 
bigger ones you'll look more at the
cross<00:01:46.350> country<00:01:46.590> market<00:01:47.070> yes<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:47.909> again<00:01:48.180> this

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
cross country market yes and again this

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.929 
cross country market yes and again this
one's<00:01:48.930> an<00:01:49.049> LSA<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.860> we<00:01:50.490> said<00:01:50.759> to<00:01:50.790> ourselves

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
one's an LSA and we said to ourselves

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.630 
one's an LSA and we said to ourselves
you<00:01:51.509> know<00:01:52.229> if<00:01:52.380> it's<00:01:52.500> going<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.710> be<00:01:52.799> an<00:01:52.890> LSA<00:01:53.310> and

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
you know if it's going to be an LSA and

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.340 
you know if it's going to be an LSA and
it<00:01:53.759> can<00:01:53.880> only<00:01:54.030> go<00:01:54.210> so<00:01:54.240> fast<00:01:54.630> why<00:01:54.930> don't<00:01:55.110> we<00:01:55.170> make

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
it can only go so fast why don't we make

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.990 
it can only go so fast why don't we make
it<00:01:55.380> wide<00:01:55.770> so<00:01:56.100> it's<00:01:56.219> at<00:01:56.310> least<00:01:56.340> comfortable<00:01:56.939> if

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
it wide so it's at least comfortable if

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.550 
it wide so it's at least comfortable if
you're<00:01:57.090> going<00:01:57.360> somewhere<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:57.899> this<00:01:58.259> one<00:01:58.439> is

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
you're going somewhere and this one is

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.200 
you're going somewhere and this one is
47<00:01:59.159> inches<00:01:59.250> wide<00:01:59.610> it's<00:01:59.820> how<00:01:59.939> you<00:02:00.000> could

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
47 inches wide it's how you could

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.730 
47 inches wide it's how you could
practically<00:02:00.509> raise<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:00.750> family<00:02:01.049> in<00:02:01.229> there<00:02:01.500> and

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
practically raise a family in there and

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.319 
practically raise a family in there and
we've<00:02:02.280> got<00:02:02.310> plenty<00:02:02.610> of<00:02:02.729> room<00:02:02.790> for<00:02:02.880> baggage

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
we've got plenty of room for baggage

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.240 
we've got plenty of room for baggage
needed<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:04.170> you<00:02:04.259> can<00:02:04.290> plant<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.649> canopy<00:02:05.009> open

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
needed and you can plant the canopy open

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.059 
needed and you can plant the canopy open
that's<00:02:05.820> always<00:02:06.060> always<00:02:06.509> ask<00:02:06.719> is<00:02:06.869> that<00:02:07.069> well

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
that's always always ask is that well

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.219 
that's always always ask is that well
now<00:02:08.310> I<00:02:08.340> don't<00:02:08.489> have<00:02:08.849> to<00:02:09.060> talk<00:02:09.780> about<00:02:09.959> the

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
now I don't have to talk about the

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.420 
now I don't have to talk about the
engine<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:10.530> little<00:02:10.739> bit<00:02:10.830> what<00:02:11.009> do<00:02:11.069> you<00:02:11.129> use<00:02:11.250> for

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
engine a little bit what do you use for

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.979 
engine a little bit what do you use for
a<00:02:11.459> powerplant<00:02:11.790> well<00:02:12.209> this<00:02:12.420> one<00:02:12.599> here<00:02:12.780> has<00:02:12.959> the

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
a powerplant well this one here has the

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.910 
a powerplant well this one here has the
o2<00:02:13.260> 31

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
o2 31

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.770 
o2 31
I've<00:02:13.980> like<00:02:14.220> homing<00:02:14.550> in<00:02:14.670> it<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:15.270> engine<00:02:15.599> we're

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
I've like homing in it the engine we're

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.449 
I've like homing in it the engine we're
probably<00:02:15.990> gonna<00:02:16.200> go<00:02:16.440> to<00:02:16.470> of<00:02:16.800> choice<00:02:17.040> is<00:02:17.280> going

probably gonna go to of choice is going

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.000 
probably gonna go to of choice is going
to<00:02:17.520> be<00:02:17.640> the<00:02:17.760> UL<00:02:18.090> it<00:02:18.720> is<00:02:18.989> about<00:02:19.349> a<00:02:19.380> hundred<00:02:19.680> and

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
to be the UL it is about a hundred and

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.339 
to be the UL it is about a hundred and
fifteen<00:02:20.370> pounds<00:02:20.730> later<00:02:20.910> than<00:02:21.180> this<00:02:21.330> one<00:02:21.569> after

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
fifteen pounds later than this one after

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:23.630 
fifteen pounds later than this one after
we're<00:02:22.470> done<00:02:22.590> with<00:02:22.739> her<00:02:22.800> preliminary<00:02:23.010> testing

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
we're done with her preliminary testing

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.339 
we're done with her preliminary testing
on<00:02:23.760> this<00:02:23.880> one<00:02:24.120> will<00:02:24.480> then<00:02:24.810> decide<00:02:25.170> which

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
on this one will then decide which

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:26.720 
on this one will then decide which
airplane<00:02:25.739> is<00:02:25.830> going<00:02:25.980> to<00:02:26.040> be<00:02:26.099> the<00:02:26.190> standard<00:02:26.550> one

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
airplane is going to be the standard one

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.880 
airplane is going to be the standard one
so<00:02:27.420> look<00:02:27.690> down<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:28.050> road<00:02:28.200> a<00:02:28.230> little<00:02:28.380> bit<00:02:28.530> and

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
so look down the road a little bit and

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.100 
so look down the road a little bit and
just<00:02:28.920> tell<00:02:29.610> us<00:02:29.640> kind<00:02:29.910> of<00:02:30.030> where<00:02:30.450> you<00:02:30.630> see<00:02:30.930> this

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
just tell us kind of where you see this

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.320 
just tell us kind of where you see this
company<00:02:31.530> in<00:02:31.620> these<00:02:31.709> airplanes<00:02:32.069> going<00:02:32.400> well<00:02:33.300> I

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
company in these airplanes going well I

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.809 
company in these airplanes going well I
think<00:02:33.540> everybody<00:02:34.319> here<00:02:34.530> at<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.739> show<00:02:35.040> is<00:02:35.400> way

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
think everybody here at the show is way

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:37.190 
think everybody here at the show is way
in<00:02:36.000> the<00:02:36.090> back<00:02:36.270> of<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:36.540> mind<00:02:36.750> where<00:02:37.050> we're

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
in the back of the mind where we're

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.680 
in the back of the mind where we're
gonna<00:02:37.260> go<00:02:37.530> with<00:02:37.650> the<00:02:37.739> third<00:02:37.920> class<00:02:38.100> medical

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
gonna go with the third class medical

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.850 
gonna go with the third class medical
because<00:02:39.690> that's<00:02:40.050> going<00:02:40.290> to<00:02:40.410> switch<00:02:40.530> things

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
because that's going to switch things

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.490 
because that's going to switch things
around<00:02:41.040> if<00:02:41.670> we<00:02:41.700> eliminate<00:02:42.360> the<00:02:42.510> medical<00:02:42.930> those

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
around if we eliminate the medical those

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.140 
around if we eliminate the medical those
Cessna<00:02:43.860> 150s<00:02:44.370> we<00:02:44.489> laugh<00:02:44.670> at<00:02:44.819> are<00:02:44.910> going<00:02:45.030> to<00:02:45.090> be

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
Cessna 150s we laugh at are going to be

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.900 
Cessna 150s we laugh at are going to be
really<00:02:45.450> valuable<00:02:45.630> again<00:02:45.989> and<00:02:46.430> I<00:02:47.430> think<00:02:47.580> that

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
really valuable again and I think that

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.449 
really valuable again and I think that
for<00:02:48.209> us<00:02:48.290> we're<00:02:49.290> gonna<00:02:49.410> stay<00:02:49.739> just<00:02:49.769> with<00:02:50.340> the

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
for us we're gonna stay just with the

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.370 
for us we're gonna stay just with the
kid<00:02:50.640> version<00:02:50.670> of<00:02:51.090> the<00:02:51.150> LSA<00:02:51.569> until<00:02:51.900> it<00:02:52.019> filters

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
kid version of the LSA until it filters

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.410 
kid version of the LSA until it filters
itself<00:02:52.769> out<00:02:52.950> one<00:02:53.730> of<00:02:53.760> the<00:02:53.910> things<00:02:54.090> we<00:02:54.239> have

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
itself out one of the things we have

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.420 
itself out one of the things we have
accent<00:02:54.989> is<00:02:55.140> and<00:02:55.350> we<00:02:55.590> just<00:02:55.830> opened<00:02:55.950> up<00:02:56.190> a<00:02:56.310> new

how to fly it was a 40-hour work week it

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.650 
how to fly it was a 40-hour work week it
is<00:03:04.080> now<00:03:04.230> a<00:03:04.260> 60-hour<00:03:04.799> workweek<00:03:05.160> and<00:03:05.610> kids<00:03:06.360> just
