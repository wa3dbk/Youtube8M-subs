the<00:00:28.650> 3s<00:00:29.099> to<00:00:29.279> receive<00:00:29.550> data<00:00:29.789> from<00:00:29.939> other<00:00:30.269> 3d<00:00:30.660> S's

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
the 3s to receive data from other 3d S's

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.260 
the 3s to receive data from other 3d S's
in<00:00:31.080> sleep<00:00:31.439> mode<00:00:31.650> it<00:00:32.369> will<00:00:32.430> also<00:00:32.610> retain<00:00:33.030> data

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
in sleep mode it will also retain data

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.959 
in sleep mode it will also retain data
from<00:00:33.600> games<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.350> stuff<00:00:34.579> there'll<00:00:35.579> be<00:00:35.670> like

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
from games and stuff there'll be like

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.030 
from games and stuff there'll be like
pseudo<00:00:36.570> multitasking<00:00:37.350> so<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:37.649> can<00:00:37.770> hit<00:00:37.920> the

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
pseudo multitasking so you can hit the

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.100 
pseudo multitasking so you can hit the
home<00:00:38.250> button<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.760> launch<00:00:38.940> certain<00:00:39.480> apps<00:00:39.690> while

home button to launch certain apps while

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.090 
home button to launch certain apps while
in<00:00:40.410> game<00:00:41.030> the<00:00:42.030> camera<00:00:42.450> will<00:00:42.899> be<00:00:43.079> used<00:00:43.230> like<00:00:43.530> you

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
in game the camera will be used like you

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.650 
in game the camera will be used like you
can<00:00:44.280> take<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.460> picture<00:00:44.850> of<00:00:44.879> yourself<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.539> use

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
can take a picture of yourself to use

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.610 
can take a picture of yourself to use
like<00:00:46.469> with<00:00:47.430> your<00:00:47.700> knees<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:48.899> can<00:00:49.200> be<00:00:49.350> saved

to an SD card and even converted

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.500 
to an SD card and even converted
converted<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.129> some<00:00:53.340> code<00:00:53.610> which<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.360> can

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
converted to some code which you can

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.270 
converted to some code which you can
send<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:54.899> friends<00:00:55.440> so<00:00:55.620> they<00:00:55.800> can<00:00:55.860> take<00:00:56.070> like

a<00:00:56.340> picture<00:00:56.610> of<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.910> code<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.420> just<00:00:58.109> like

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
a picture of the code and just like

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.560 
a picture of the code and just like
receive<00:00:59.190> your<00:00:59.460> me<00:00:59.640> that's<00:01:00.000> a<00:01:00.180> pretty<00:01:00.300> cool

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
receive your me that's a pretty cool

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.310 
receive your me that's a pretty cool
idea<00:01:00.890> there<00:01:01.890> will<00:01:01.980> be<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.129> tag<00:01:02.370> mode<00:01:02.579> me<00:01:02.850> Plaza

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
idea there will be a tag mode me Plaza

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.910 
idea there will be a tag mode me Plaza
which<00:01:04.320> is<00:01:04.500> kind<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:04.920> like<00:01:05.010> they<00:01:05.780> we<00:01:06.780> me<00:01:07.530> parade

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
which is kind of like they we me parade

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.310 
which is kind of like they we me parade
I<00:01:07.950> guess<00:01:08.310> that's<00:01:09.299> what<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:09.540> seems<00:01:09.750> like<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:10.760> can

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
I guess that's what it seems like it can

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.499 
I guess that's what it seems like it can
automotives<00:01:13.320> into<00:01:13.619> one<00:01:13.830> there's<00:01:14.729> apparently

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
automotives into one there's apparently

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.590 
automotives into one there's apparently
going<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.900> be<00:01:16.020> like<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.409> cradle<00:01:16.890> for<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.130> 3ds

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
going to be like a cradle for the 3ds

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.120 
going to be like a cradle for the 3ds
lots<00:01:18.600> of<00:01:18.750> cool<00:01:18.900> stuff<00:01:18.960> yes<00:01:19.560> I<00:01:19.710> am<00:01:19.860> indeed

februari 26 2011 for japan cost is 25

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.800 
februari 26 2011 for japan cost is 25
thousand<00:01:49.470> yen<00:01:49.649> now<00:01:50.520> that<00:01:51.060> translates<00:01:51.630> to

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
thousand yen now that translates to

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.730 
thousand yen now that translates to
about<00:01:51.840> three<00:01:52.439> hundred<00:01:52.470> dollars<00:01:53.280> however<00:01:54.740> the

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
about three hundred dollars however the

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.760 
about three hundred dollars however the
dsi<00:01:56.280> like<00:01:56.969> if<00:01:57.119> you<00:01:57.240> converted<00:01:57.689> I<00:01:57.960> think<00:01:58.380> in

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
dsi like if you converted I think in

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.179 
dsi like if you converted I think in
North<00:01:59.700> America<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.240> dsi<00:02:00.630> was<00:02:00.810> actually

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
North America the dsi was actually

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:04.310 
North America the dsi was actually
cheapest<00:02:02.189> if<00:02:02.369> you<00:02:02.549> convert<00:02:02.969> it<00:02:03.119> so<00:02:03.299> it's<00:02:04.140> still

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
cheapest if you convert it so it's still

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.039 
cheapest if you convert it so it's still
possible<00:02:04.590> that<00:02:05.189> it'll<00:02:06.060> have<00:02:06.240> that'll<00:02:06.899> cost

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
possible that it'll have that'll cost

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.300 
possible that it'll have that'll cost
like<00:02:07.229> two<00:02:07.439> hundred<00:02:07.560> dollars<00:02:07.979> in<00:02:08.099> North

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
like two hundred dollars in North

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
a kingdom hearts game but I think some

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.610 
a kingdom hearts game but I think some
snapshots<00:03:25.060> were<00:03:25.630> already<00:03:25.930> shown<00:03:26.290> like

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
snapshots were already shown like

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.650 
snapshots were already shown like
earlier<00:03:27.340> and<00:03:28.830> then<00:03:29.970> DSiWare<00:03:30.970> titles<00:03:31.360> will<00:03:31.630> be

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
earlier and then DSiWare titles will be

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.199 
earlier and then DSiWare titles will be
transferable<00:03:32.500> so<00:03:33.250> the<00:03:33.489> moment<00:03:33.670> it<00:03:33.850> comes<00:03:33.970> out

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
transferable so the moment it comes out

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:35.640 
transferable so the moment it comes out
