inability<00:00:37.930> I<00:00:38.260> would<00:00:38.590> say<00:00:40.080> and<00:00:41.080> I<00:00:41.860> think<00:00:42.070> I

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
inability I would say and I think I

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.750 
inability I would say and I think I
would<00:00:42.660> very<00:00:43.660> comfortable<00:00:44.050> on<00:00:44.110> it<00:00:44.140> and<00:00:44.730> what<00:00:45.730> I

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
would very comfortable on it and what I

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.190 
would very comfortable on it and what I
want<00:00:45.940> to<00:00:45.970> do<00:00:46.120> now<00:00:46.270> is<00:00:46.450> take<00:00:46.690> it<00:00:46.840> off<00:00:46.899> your<00:00:47.079> hands

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:47.200 
want to do now is take it off your hands

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.889 
want to do now is take it off your hands
for<00:00:47.440> a<00:00:47.739> couple<00:00:47.890> of<00:00:48.160> days<00:00:48.310> and<00:00:48.610> go<00:00:48.850> I<00:00:49.360> think

00:00:49.889 --> 00:00:49.899 
for a couple of days and go I think

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:51.960 
for a couple of days and go I think
somewhere<00:00:50.200> to<00:00:50.800> visit<00:00:51.130> in<00:00:51.220> the<00:00:51.670> outback

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:51.970 
somewhere to visit in the outback

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.530 
somewhere to visit in the outback
somewhere<00:00:52.390> I<00:00:52.840> think<00:00:53.470> for<00:00:53.950> me<00:00:54.100> I<00:00:54.430> enjoy<00:00:54.820> riding

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
somewhere I think for me I enjoy riding

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.229 
somewhere I think for me I enjoy riding
this<00:00:56.160> but<00:00:57.160> for<00:00:57.309> me<00:00:57.370> this<00:00:57.520> is<00:00:57.579> really<00:00:57.910> around

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
this but for me this is really around

00:00:58.239 --> 00:00:59.430 
this but for me this is really around
what<00:00:58.510> I<00:00:58.540> can<00:00:58.809> do<00:00:58.960> with<00:00:59.110> it

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
what I can do with it

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.190 
what I can do with it
I<00:00:59.469> think<00:00:59.800> it's<00:00:59.950> probably<00:01:00.190> more<00:01:00.809> you<00:01:01.809> know<00:01:01.930> I

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.200 
I think it's probably more you know I

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.729 
I think it's probably more you know I
know

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
know

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:05.189 
know
certainly<00:01:03.309> in<00:01:03.850> met<00:01:04.600> across<00:01:04.750> and<00:01:05.050> there's<00:01:05.170> a

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
certainly in met across and there's a

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:06.630 
certainly in met across and there's a
lot<00:01:05.290> of<00:01:05.320> value<00:01:05.740> and<00:01:05.920> enjoyment<00:01:06.040> out<00:01:06.490> of<00:01:06.520> the

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
lot of value and enjoyment out of the

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.350 
lot of value and enjoyment out of the
sport<00:01:07.000> and<00:01:07.410> whatever<00:01:08.410> but<00:01:08.680> I<00:01:08.860> see<00:01:09.759> for<00:01:10.210> me<00:01:10.330> this

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
sport and whatever but I see for me this

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.260 
sport and whatever but I see for me this
is<00:01:10.770> this<00:01:11.770> is<00:01:11.979> just<00:01:12.250> a<00:01:12.369> really<00:01:12.610> enjoyable<00:01:12.880> tool

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
is this is just a really enjoyable tool

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.570 
is this is just a really enjoyable tool
to<00:01:13.810> really<00:01:14.050> like<00:01:14.500> take<00:01:14.740> me<00:01:14.860> completely<00:01:15.310> away

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
to really like take me completely away

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.600 
to really like take me completely away
from<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:16.659> rest<00:01:16.840> of<00:01:17.049> civilization<00:01:17.770> I<00:01:18.369> was

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
from the rest of civilization I was

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.190 
from the rest of civilization I was
driving<00:01:18.909> up<00:01:18.940> there<00:01:19.119> along<00:01:19.299> a<00:01:19.330> ridge<00:01:19.570> which<00:01:19.990> was

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
driving up there along a ridge which was

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.350 
driving up there along a ridge which was
probably<00:01:20.530> only<00:01:20.740> about<00:01:20.950> 3<00:01:21.640> or<00:01:21.670> 4<00:01:21.729> metres<00:01:22.180> wife

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
probably only about 3 or 4 metres wife

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.060 
probably only about 3 or 4 metres wife
and<00:01:22.720> I<00:01:22.780> felt<00:01:23.020> really<00:01:23.170> comfortable<00:01:23.500> even

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
and I felt really comfortable even

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.640 
and I felt really comfortable even
though<00:01:24.190> it's<00:01:24.369> completely<00:01:24.850> covered<00:01:25.060> in

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
though it's completely covered in

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.780 
though it's completely covered in
starting<00:01:26.650> through<00:01:26.860> this<00:01:27.010> a<00:01:27.070> big<00:01:27.430> mounds<00:01:27.700> of

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
starting through this a big mounds of

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.810 
starting through this a big mounds of
gravel<00:01:27.850> yeah<00:01:28.689> that<00:01:29.140> also<00:01:29.530> felt<00:01:29.890> how<00:01:30.520> could<00:01:30.700> the

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
gravel yeah that also felt how could the

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.070 
gravel yeah that also felt how could the
front<00:01:31.030> wheels<00:01:31.180> digging<00:01:31.570> in<00:01:31.659> nice<00:01:31.840> they

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
front wheels digging in nice they

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.850 
front wheels digging in nice they
thought<00:01:32.290> I<00:01:32.409> wasn't<00:01:32.590> just<00:01:32.830> going<00:01:32.950> to<00:01:33.130> push<00:01:33.580> out

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
thought I wasn't just going to push out

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.109 
thought I wasn't just going to push out
could<00:01:35.860> I<00:01:35.920> keep<00:01:36.070> a<00:01:36.220> liter<00:01:36.490> of<00:01:36.520> fuel<00:01:36.790> in<00:01:37.000> my

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
could I keep a liter of fuel in my

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.980 
could I keep a liter of fuel in my
backpack<00:01:37.409> for<00:01:38.880> an<00:01:39.880> emergency<00:01:40.600> as<00:01:40.689> it<00:01:40.840> works

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
backpack for an emergency as it works

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.359 
backpack for an emergency as it works
knowing<00:01:41.380> that<00:01:41.530> that<00:01:41.680> would<00:01:41.830> be<00:01:42.070> a<00:01:42.100> meaningful

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
knowing that that would be a meaningful

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:45.660 
knowing that that would be a meaningful
addition<00:01:43.180> to<00:01:43.390> the<00:01:43.479> range<00:01:43.659> if<00:01:44.049> I<00:01:44.670> feel

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
addition to the range if I feel

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.490 
addition to the range if I feel
somewhere<00:01:46.090> yeah<00:01:46.540> that<00:01:46.960> sort<00:01:47.170> of<00:01:47.200> thing<00:01:47.350> is

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
somewhere yeah that sort of thing is

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.929 
somewhere yeah that sort of thing is
where<00:01:47.740> as<00:01:47.860> where<00:01:48.040> the<00:01:48.100> perhaps<00:01:48.310> a<00:01:48.369> bigger<00:01:48.640> bike

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 
where as where the perhaps a bigger bike

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:50.190 
where as where the perhaps a bigger bike
that<00:01:49.150> we<00:01:49.240> just<00:01:49.390> get<00:01:49.540> sucked<00:01:49.810> up<00:01:49.960> really

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
that we just get sucked up really

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.580 
that we just get sucked up really
quickly

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.840 

yeah<00:01:53.590> carry<00:01:53.950> a<00:01:54.040> little<00:01:54.130> bit<00:01:54.280> of<00:01:54.369> insurance

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850
