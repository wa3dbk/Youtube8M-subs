different methods I've got PBA adhesive
for<00:00:24.180> one<00:00:24.300> side<00:00:24.800> and<00:00:25.800> this<00:00:26.660> tubing<00:00:27.660> stuff<00:00:27.930> that

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
for one side and this tubing stuff that

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.679 
for one side and this tubing stuff that
you<00:00:28.289> false<00:00:28.590> in<00:00:28.800> for<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.130> other<00:00:29.250> self<00:00:29.689> it's

PBA I'm just gonna pour some on Mildred
through<00:00:45.650> normally<00:00:46.650> mix<00:00:46.979> it<00:00:47.190> with<00:00:47.400> a<00:00:47.729> little

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
through normally mix it with a little

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.560 
through normally mix it with a little
bit<00:00:48.269> of<00:00:49.129> sand<00:00:50.129> paper<00:00:50.430> which<00:00:50.790> I<00:00:50.940> was<00:00:51.119> with<00:00:51.360> this

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
bit of sand paper which I was with this

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.460 
bit of sand paper which I was with this
work<00:00:51.809> no<00:00:52.409> sandpaper<00:00:53.159> sawdust<00:00:54.119> which<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:55.290> will

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:55.470 
work no sandpaper sawdust which I will

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.649 
work no sandpaper sawdust which I will
do<00:00:55.650> if<00:00:55.710> this<00:00:55.860> works<00:00:56.159> but<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.760> got<00:00:56.909> handed<00:00:57.449> mine

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:57.659 
do if this works but and got handed mine

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:01.340 
do if this works but and got handed mine
for<00:00:58.019> doing<00:00:58.199> them<00:00:58.850> so<00:00:59.850> I'm<00:01:00.089> gonna<00:01:00.299> have<00:01:00.659> to<00:01:00.960> skip

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
for doing them so I'm gonna have to skip

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.070 
for doing them so I'm gonna have to skip
it<00:01:02.150> but<00:01:03.150> sir<00:01:03.540> please<00:01:04.049> give<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.769> try<00:01:05.930> then<00:01:06.930> I

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
it but sir please give it a try then I

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.109 
it but sir please give it a try then I
see<00:01:07.500> here<00:01:08.240> good<00:01:09.240> ripple<00:01:10.080> through<00:01:10.409> quite<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.770> bit

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
see here good ripple through quite a bit

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:14.140 
see here good ripple through quite a bit
there's<00:01:12.119> probably<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.479> good<00:01:12.509> reason<00:01:12.659> having

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:14.150 
there's probably a good reason having

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:18.100 
there's probably a good reason having
sandpaper<00:01:15.150> saw<00:01:15.689> dust<00:01:15.960> mixed<00:01:16.380> in<00:01:16.650> as<00:01:16.770> well<00:01:16.950> I

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
sandpaper saw dust mixed in as well I

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.860 
sandpaper saw dust mixed in as well I
think<00:01:19.110> it's<00:01:19.260> still<00:01:19.560> gives<00:01:19.800> an<00:01:19.980> idea<00:01:20.870> whether

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:21.870 
think it's still gives an idea whether

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:27.610 
think it's still gives an idea whether
it<00:01:22.290> work<00:01:22.940> and<00:01:23.940> that's<00:01:24.120> one

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:27.620 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.210 

I'll<00:01:28.310> try<00:01:28.550> the<00:01:28.610> other<00:01:28.790> side<00:01:28.910> of<00:01:29.120> the<00:01:29.300> board<00:01:30.220> so

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
I'll try the other side of the board so

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.760 
I'll try the other side of the board so
we<00:01:31.250> get<00:01:31.580> units<00:01:32.390> barrel<00:01:32.750> dis<00:01:33.050> stuff<00:01:33.260> which<00:01:33.590> you

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
we get units barrel dis stuff which you

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.670 
we get units barrel dis stuff which you
just<00:01:34.210> according<00:01:35.210> to<00:01:35.390> instructions<00:01:35.750> you<00:01:36.440> lay

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
just according to instructions you lay

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.050 
just according to instructions you lay
on<00:01:37.180> and<00:01:38.180> then<00:01:39.190> squeeze<00:01:40.190> into<00:01:40.430> this<00:01:40.670> device

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
on and then squeeze into this device

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:55.750 
on and then squeeze into this device
SolarCity<00:01:41.750> worse

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:55.760 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:24.020 

even<00:01:56.760> from<00:01:57.060> bullets<00:01:57.570> as<00:01:57.720> you<00:01:57.840> can<00:01:58.080> see

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.420 

just<00:02:25.030> finish<00:02:25.330> this<00:02:25.480> off<00:02:25.690> now<00:02:25.930> you<00:02:26.860> got<00:02:27.100> that

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
just finish this off now you got that

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.880 
just finish this off now you got that
right<00:02:28.920> here<00:02:29.920> I've<00:02:30.640> got<00:02:30.700> the<00:02:31.090> to<00:02:32.080> turn<00:02:32.380> on<00:02:32.590> here

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
right here I've got the to turn on here

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.030 
right here I've got the to turn on here
quite<00:02:33.850> easing<00:02:34.180> in<00:02:34.390> I<00:02:34.690> put<00:02:35.230> a<00:02:35.260> second<00:02:35.590> one<00:02:35.710> along

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
quite easing in I put a second one along

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.430 
quite easing in I put a second one along
here<00:02:36.310> it'll<00:02:36.670> be<00:02:36.850> able<00:02:36.910> to<00:02:37.090> see<00:02:37.300> it<00:02:37.630> was<00:02:38.200> very

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
here it'll be able to see it was very

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.100 
here it'll be able to see it was very
easy<00:02:38.530> what's<00:02:38.920> behind<00:02:39.100> it<00:02:39.570> and<00:02:40.570> I've<00:02:40.690> just<00:02:40.720> put

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
easy what's behind it and I've just put

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:47.820 
easy what's behind it and I've just put
in<00:02:41.230> a<00:02:42.330> little<00:02:43.330> bit<00:02:43.600> more<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:46.420> pvas<00:02:46.960> to<00:02:47.440> sipping

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
in a little bit more the pvas to sipping

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.780 
in a little bit more the pvas to sipping
do<00:02:48.010> anything<00:02:48.310> there<00:02:48.520> that<00:02:48.990> definitely<00:02:50.790> and

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
do anything there that definitely and

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.850 
do anything there that definitely and
see<00:02:51.970> why<00:02:52.120> they<00:02:52.270> say<00:02:52.480> you<00:02:52.540> need<00:02:52.750> some<00:02:53.500> sort<00:02:53.680> of

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
see why they say you need some sort of

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.920 
see why they say you need some sort of
next<00:02:54.280> industry<00:02:54.670> ahead<00:02:55.030> substance<00:02:55.630> because

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
next industry ahead substance because

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
next industry ahead substance because
it's<00:02:57.360> trips<00:02:58.360> to<00:02:58.570> the<00:02:58.720> homes<00:02:58.930> and<00:02:59.170> thought<00:02:59.710> was

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
it's trips to the homes and thought was

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.400 
it's trips to the homes and thought was
a<00:02:59.980> bit<00:03:00.280> too<00:03:00.520> easily<00:03:00.760> there<00:03:01.030> but<00:03:01.840> I<00:03:02.050> think<00:03:02.320> I've

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
a bit too easily there but I think I've

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.920 
a bit too easily there but I think I've
gotten<00:03:02.620> up<00:03:02.800> and<00:03:03.010> see<00:03:03.280> how<00:03:03.490> loss<00:03:03.760> and<00:03:04.150> this<00:03:04.270> this

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
gotten up and see how loss and this this

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.160 
gotten up and see how loss and this this
is<00:03:05.080> quite<00:03:05.320> a<00:03:05.350> busy<00:03:05.530> bit<00:03:05.800> of<00:03:05.950> all<00:03:06.850> why<00:03:07.060> so<00:03:08.020> we'll

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
is quite a busy bit of all why so we'll

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.380 
is quite a busy bit of all why so we'll
see<00:03:08.380> whether<00:03:08.740> it<00:03:08.950> gets<00:03:09.520> shaped<00:03:09.820> whether<00:03:10.180> i<00:03:10.300> can

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
see whether it gets shaped whether i can

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.110 
see whether it gets shaped whether i can
get<00:03:10.720> shaken<00:03:10.990> out<00:03:11.230> but<00:03:11.560> people<00:03:12.520> walking<00:03:12.850> over

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
get shaken out but people walking over

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.850 
get shaken out but people walking over
and<00:03:14.370> see<00:03:15.370> what<00:03:15.490> we<00:03:15.580> can<00:03:15.730> do
