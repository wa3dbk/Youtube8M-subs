00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 have you heard the phrase that you pray there may be 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.210
 a change of opinion without repentance 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.880
 but there is no genuine repentance without 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.740
 a change of opinion in a video 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.929
 previous had mentioned my displeasure 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.509
 about the most recent adaptation of 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.300
 the hasbro transformers franchise 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.520
 prime however with having seen the 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.350
 first season I found elements that 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.960
 no doubt they have made me swallow 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.449
 my own words about the 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.189
 structure that this series carries is 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.990
 ironic that in the end I do not 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.969
 have even followed the saying with the 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.739
 what he calls free and cities magic that 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.870
 is that you do not judge the book for its 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.850
 cover but good at the end of the day 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.649
 I think it's time to share my 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.480
 opinion about this series in the 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.480
 powerful magnet that separates it from other 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.730
 the first thing we noticed the introduction 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.950
 that this time he does not try to be faithful 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:32.290
 to the original theme of the series and in my 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.360
 I personal view is good in itself 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:37.270
 is short and focuses very well on the action that 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:40.360
 this one wants to offer us is simply 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.280
 very nice the character design follows 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.930
 being something that I do not like for 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.550
 nothing since it shows in itself what 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.710
 he was from the trilogy of michael bay 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:50.200
 combined with the quirky designs 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.270
 of the animated version that at the end of 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.010
 accounts lets you believe that it's another series 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.010
 that is the tail of the fame of a premiere in 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.870
 box office but as it is to clarify them it is 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.000
 much more accomplished and with a more focus 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.040
 serious and dark that the movies themselves 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.950
 and even with my favorite versions 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.510
 head micro masters in armed sex as 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.280
 here it was known to have a gift and 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.040
 memorable seasons of war of 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.690
 beasts even though it was difficult 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.780
 follow her by the cartoon chain 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.310
 network and had to use the internet 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.140
 to know about the plot there are still 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.210
 elements that followed in the trilogy of 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.490
 gei but in the end they end 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.290
 being such aesthetic and easy things 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.390
 forget about how well achieved they are 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.880
 the battles as well as the element 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:32.800
 of the same as is the drama is the 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.140
 first time unlike army or 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.090
 in the pumping robots notice childrenized 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.980
 and with a development of personalities and 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.220
 stories that have left me for a long time 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:45.010
 satisfied even being focused 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.930
 in children outside of the 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.700
 iconic characters of the franchise 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.770
 how are they optimal 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.620
 megatron starscream and she so 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:55.540
 apocalyptic un and with a character with 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.610
 who empathizes is too much and demonstrates 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.010
 very well what I am saying is like this 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:02.170
 since its first appearance in the first 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.270
 generation was given an impression of the 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.519
 typical female robot that is only for 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.230
 not show very macho elements to 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:11.110
 be a male franchise in their 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.150
 most even the same bay placed it 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.459
 in the movie to just kill her 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.040
 because he did not like it but this version 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:20.380
 makes this female robot a character 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.239
 strong thanks to a dramatic origin and 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.370
 their confrontation over several 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:26.500
 episodes with a renegade disappointment 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.600
 angry call me make her a character 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.610
 formidable and much more charismatic than 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.840
 other female transformers from other 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.760
 series 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.470
 I'm not saying the iconic ones do not have 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.349
 development here but with art and 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.970
 you just give it a strong follow-up 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:42.459
 of some others as are handbags 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.110
 Rachel and I went back they are also given a good 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.709
 follow- up despite the fact that the latter 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:49.150
 it still looks like the movies 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.860
 optimal paint is an icon in the 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.599
 franchise of the transformers and their 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:56.440
 presence from the first to the last 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:59.470
 episode is always majestic and that's what 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.510
 I refer to all your incarnations of the 

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.489
 antagonists I can also say what 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.849
 same but respect the cliché of being the 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:08.290
 sons of bitches who want to kill him all 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:10.239
 megatron despite his comings and goings 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.310
 in the series that have you away from the 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:14.650
 plots of some episodes is a 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.959
 exemplary villain very well surrounded by 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.359
 characters like this screen are an ox 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.370
 with the raising of the co-stars and I 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:23.380
 I mean the human characters I 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.419
 he was completely impressed by what 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.490
 very well fit that are in the series 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:29.889
 and its good justifies presence in the 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.630
 I take off my hat that 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:33.550
 first time you meet and you fight 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.350
 with human characters also very 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.300
 developed and aware of where 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.110
 are stuck with decisions that are a 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.910
 risk to your 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:43.000
 loved ones as well as for them 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.770
 themselves the human characters of others 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.140
 series maybe if they had the same 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.570
 concept but their contributions and need in 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:51.400
 the series was not at all comfortable 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.440
 that proved very well in the before 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.840
 mentioned war of beasts where these 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.120
 they could not allow the 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.250
 comical do not feel hindered with 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:03.400
 the main characters or at least not 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:05.290
 create your minor plots 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.390
 even in Neuquén right where yes 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:09.340
 at the beginning they had a potential in the 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:11.140
 history would end up becoming 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.150
 just fucking stuffed together with others 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.950
 characters that served as a joke with the 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.710
 situation and then have importance in 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:19.050
 climax and epilogue of the same or in others 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.280
 cases be unconditionally 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.050
 overrated just for being bastards that 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.840
 they want to be in the same field of 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.970
 battle with the principals here by 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.040
 another side in the main with jacques his 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.900
 interaction with archi and others like that 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:34.180
 as your point of view of the situation 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:36.310
 makes it perfectly harmonizes with the 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:39.250
 dilemma of some complex problems and 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:42.520
 dramatic of the series I recommend the 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:43.840
 chapter 12 21 and 23 so that they understand 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.270
 what I say 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:48.310
 of rafael and mico also fit despite 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:51.280
 of being not so stereotyped 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:53.350
 preadolescents are at least a lot 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.090
 better used than the typical asshole 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:56.740
 that you want to catch the good of your 

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:58.479
 cole and take advantage of the situation to 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:01.090
 show heroic attributes that the 

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:04.360
 conquisten I remind you it's just my 

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:06.310
 sincere opinion adult characters like 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:07.960
 the fowler agent are characters that 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:10.150
 they simply try to explain 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:12.699
 different points of view between humans 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:14.560
 and robots and clear apart from the 

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:16.479
 Decepticons a first human villain 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.820
 being also a potential threat 

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:20.830
 for autobots as if it is the 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:22.660
 first time I really a character 

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:24.340
 human like this can cause 

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:26.320
 problems and dilemmas to them 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:29.290
 transformers and really do it a 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:32.290
 interesting character as I already had 

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:34.090
 mentioned the cake strawberry this 

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:36.010
 series is the drama that he handles with his 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:38.260
 characters both autobots and 

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:40.330
 human characters share the weight of the 

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:42.789
 conflict as well as the different points 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:44.620
 of sight about the war obviously 

00:06:42.789 --> 00:06:46.539
 I 'm not referring to touching the 

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:48.550
 subject in all its complexity as if 

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:49.430
 it was a story of we won macros or 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:51.410
 something like that 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:53.390
 in which there are sometimes arguments 

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:54.950
 that if it's okay or not notice in a way 

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:56.960
 honorable to your enemy and all the 

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:59.090
 dirty cheesy camera focus by 

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:01.340
 I am already convinced by a masterpiece 

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:03.080
 but it's very good for your time and I 

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:05.000
 it seems good in short and already for 

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.950
 finish I highly recommend the series is 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.810
 a very different experience for 

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:11.000
 those who have become accustomed to 

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:12.890
 other series of the franchise I hope 

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.960
 can see the second completely 

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:17.630
 season although I'll have to limit yourself to 

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:19.580
 see it on the internet is everything comment and 

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:21.880
 point in and we'll see you until the next 

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:21.880
 video
