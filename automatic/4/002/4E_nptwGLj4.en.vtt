00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.299
 Hello everyone guys with you and today 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:17.540
 I'll tell you about how raki 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:18.020
 perform lbz not even so at all how 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.270
 raki 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.099
 I play that is, we all play more 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.140
 less normal there play the case you 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:26.000
 slightly worse someone else is better than me but 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.189
 In general, we are certainly surprised when 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.899
 some kind of 45 percent crayfish 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.419
 comes to me in the VKontakte group 

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:35.210
 spread Nagib Tomsk Lobanov with 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:37.760
 5000 damage there with some incredible 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.070
 medals we think like like this 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.019
 maybe it's not always like that 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.019
 it turns out and he got it all this 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:46.909
 did a bunch of medals there like him 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:50.089
 same there are 45 percent wins like this how 

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:52.909
 how he did it, and the guys in 

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:55.730
 Sunday evening before my gold 

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:58.159
 I really understood how to stream 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:01.010
 it is possible and you know why, therefore 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:02.769
 that there are three things that are needed well for 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.470
 here is such a bend if you 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:09.560
 45 percent cancer is great tank it 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.300
 wbc and it's even worse crayfish and here are the guys 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.040
 I went to Randy did not really 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.140
 somewhere in 10 minutes before the stream was necessary 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.030
 check fps in the game just once 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.040
 roll up and I just had not yet 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.079
 started on heavy tanks 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.270
 so I just wanted to check to see 

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:25.729
 what's there like here-here-back but no 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.950
 in which case lbz not perform and here i am 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.630
 I left despite his well fps like so 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.399
 nothing then all here with a stream 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.070
 okay load well computers 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:35.899
 keep going I'll merge somewhere 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.780
 because by the condition 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:40.820
 lbz could not damage but kill 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.450
 nobody could have that is so i 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.430
 I decided that full gold press account here 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.369
 I'll go shoot some and then 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:52.100
 somewhere and merge to lg . one 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:55.280
 left but not all the guys turned out 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.020
 just here i am aiming t-34 principle 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.000
 I shoot like a real rag 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.729
 breaks out there somewhere that 59 something 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.979
 happens somewhere somewhere some not 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:06.409
 I know blood-guts smear on the walls 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:09.860
 our allies and opponents but I'm in the top 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:12.590
 I sit in the swamp well, you know what 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.300
 this is this real rock vanya 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.720
 I decided not to train our attention 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.879
 allies who suffer from signature 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.860
 tanks why really why 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:24.680
 go there why would anyone help me 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.599
 I wanted my gameplay in this battle 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.480
 behave like a 45 percent 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:31.819
 why should I go somewhere better i will go to 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.349
 base to the enemies and die there i mean i 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.480
 really just wanted to go to the base 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:37.160
 mound and kill nobody and nothing 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.440
 do just merge because how are you 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.260
 you know, there was no one to kill 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.780
 because lt would tt 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.370
 and there the condition is that you killed one 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.590
 the enemy and immediately perform a bad thing 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.420
 shoot camping in the Khan we do not get all 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:53.959
 ok tutaev every cpz 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:56.209
 from 1 stock that's basically my such 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:58.549
 the same red fellow as I myself leave 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:01.069
 give home more and more shoot him 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:04.030

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:06.890
 1000 homework received their 45 percent 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.290
 whether a pack and go further here from 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.790
 roll out to iso vytselivat to hatch and 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.129
 I do not punch because but such 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.290
 okay I'm going on why should I 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:17.510
 do you need some god from there 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.810
 I will go better somewhere 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:23.900
 that is, I still carry a great home for 393 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:26.060
 and that's all the guys can not continue to charge it 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.310
 gets on the harp but we don't turn on 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.739

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:36.739
 Yaga does not fall and I do not fall 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.170
 I get and I say yes and only a little bit 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:41.030
 there somewhere along the armor but berries and already on 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.540

 here the guys just caught up 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:59.030
 In short, I could not resist I killed my mouth 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:00.680
 I didn't want to kill anyone in this fight, but 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.540

 happen in random 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:51.550
 sometimes you want to drag but you 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:53.620
 nothing works because it does not fly 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:56.140
