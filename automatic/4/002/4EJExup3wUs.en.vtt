hey<00:00:03.540> there<00:00:03.780> I'm<00:00:08.599> testing<00:00:09.599> a<00:00:09.660> new<00:00:09.690> way<00:00:09.960> to<00:00:09.990> keep

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
hey there I'm testing a new way to keep

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.999 
hey there I'm testing a new way to keep
the<00:00:10.590> shelves<00:00:11.280> in<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:11.429> cage<00:00:12.559> as<00:00:13.559> you<00:00:13.679> can<00:00:13.799> see

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
the shelves in the cage as you can see

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.210 
the shelves in the cage as you can see
they're<00:00:14.219> all<00:00:14.370> at<00:00:15.030> an<00:00:15.150> angle<00:00:16.010> which<00:00:17.010> actually

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
they're all at an angle which actually

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.400 
they're all at an angle which actually
better<00:00:17.550> mimics<00:00:17.970> what<00:00:18.150> they<00:00:18.300> might<00:00:18.480> come

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
better mimics what they might come

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.410 
better mimics what they might come
across<00:00:19.529> in<00:00:19.920> nature<00:00:21.859> and<00:00:22.859> for<00:00:23.730> my<00:00:23.880> purpose<00:00:24.269> it

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
across in nature and for my purpose it

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:32.370 
across in nature and for my purpose it
allows<00:00:24.660> me<00:00:25.070> to<00:00:26.070> run<00:00:26.220> off<00:00:27.890> hey<00:00:28.890> there

hungry this is a neat idea to its up

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.730 
hungry this is a neat idea to its up
using<00:01:21.040> a<00:01:21.220> plastic<00:01:22.110> ice<00:01:23.110> cream<00:01:23.380> container

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
using a plastic ice cream container

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.790 
using a plastic ice cream container
hanging<00:01:24.580> on<00:01:24.700> the<00:01:24.790> door<00:01:25.290> they<00:01:26.290> can<00:01:26.440> go<00:01:26.530> in<00:01:26.560> there

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:26.800 
hanging on the door they can go in there

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.700 
hanging on the door they can go in there
if<00:01:26.830> they<00:01:27.009> want<00:01:27.810> but<00:01:28.810> when<00:01:28.960> I<00:01:28.990> open<00:01:29.229> the<00:01:29.320> door<00:01:29.500> it

and then this cage is for me the

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
and then this cage is for me the
nuthouse<00:04:00.129> these<00:04:01.129> guys<00:04:01.340> haven't<00:04:01.610> come<00:04:01.730> out<00:04:01.819> yet

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.240 

it's<00:04:12.950> not<00:04:13.070> much<00:04:13.220> more<00:04:13.370> interesting<00:04:13.820> having

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
it's not much more interesting having

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:21.580 
it's not much more interesting having
larger<00:04:16.250> cages<00:04:16.850> than<00:04:17.150> smaller<00:04:17.630> ones<00:04:20.500> because<00:04:21.500> I

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
larger cages than smaller ones because I

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:22.990 
larger cages than smaller ones because I
have<00:04:21.709> fewer<00:04:21.950> cages<00:04:22.370> the<00:04:22.550> animals<00:04:22.850> get<00:04:22.970> a

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
have fewer cages the animals get a

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.820 
have fewer cages the animals get a
little<00:04:23.210> more<00:04:23.300> attention<00:04:25.990> if<00:04:26.990> I<00:04:27.170> had<00:04:27.350> 19

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
little more attention if I had 19

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.080 
little more attention if I had 19
