autosave function would have done its

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.849 
autosave function would have done its
job<00:00:20.189> and<00:00:20.580> it<00:00:21.270> would<00:00:21.660> have<00:00:21.779> been<00:00:21.840> backed<00:00:22.410> up<00:00:22.650> to

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
job and it would have been backed up to

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.189 
job and it would have been backed up to
Google<00:00:23.039> clouds<00:00:23.699> because<00:00:24.150> I've<00:00:24.630> got<00:00:24.840> a<00:00:24.869> Google

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
Google clouds because I've got a Google

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.620 
Google clouds because I've got a Google

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
earlier on so that was an option for me

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.410 
earlier on so that was an option for me
but<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:11.490> should<00:01:11.670> be<00:01:11.700> your<00:01:11.880> first<00:01:12.060> point<00:01:12.270> of

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
but that should be your first point of

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.390 
but that should be your first point of
call<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:12.869> if<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:13.409> click<00:01:13.590> this<00:01:13.740> button<00:01:13.799> you

unsaved documents should be located in

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.609 
unsaved documents should be located in
here<00:01:21.090> so<00:01:21.479> that's<00:01:21.960> one<00:01:22.229> option

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
here so that's one option

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.020 
here so that's one option
second<00:01:23.189> option<00:01:23.580> was<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.689> go<00:01:25.020> into<00:01:25.700> Windows<00:01:26.700> and

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
second option was to go into Windows and

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.810 
second option was to go into Windows and
see<00:01:28.020> if<00:01:28.170> there<00:01:28.350> was<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.500> recovery<00:01:28.979> file<00:01:29.250> because

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
see if there was a recovery file because

information every 13 minutes well you
know<00:01:40.049> I<00:01:40.259> think<00:01:40.530> by<00:01:40.650> default<00:01:40.710> that's<00:01:41.250> set<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.670> 20

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
know I think by default that's set to 20

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.780 
know I think by default that's set to 20
minutes<00:01:42.930> or<00:01:43.079> something<00:01:43.229> I<00:01:43.649> set<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.340> around

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
minutes or something I set it to around

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.660 
minutes or something I set it to around
10<00:01:45.270> minutes<00:01:45.479> or<00:01:45.750> so<00:01:45.780> because<00:01:46.470> I<00:01:46.680> find<00:01:46.979> if<00:01:47.130> I<00:01:47.280> set

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
10 minutes or so because I find if I set

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.639 
10 minutes or so because I find if I set
it<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:47.820> a<00:01:48.299> lower<00:01:48.689> number<00:01:48.810> than<00:01:49.200> 10<00:01:49.439> minutes

and that will set it up as a new file on

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.670 
and that will set it up as a new file on
the<00:06:09.610> Google<00:06:10.510> server<00:06:10.750> and<00:06:11.080> then<00:06:11.290> you<00:06:11.410> can<00:06:11.560> just

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 
the Google server and then you can just

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.070 
the Google server and then you can just
go<00:06:11.830> ahead<00:06:11.950> and<00:06:12.220> sink<00:06:12.520> that<00:06:12.640> so<00:06:13.270> it<00:06:13.480> gives<00:06:13.750> it<00:06:13.930> a

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 
go ahead and sink that so it gives it a

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.490 
go ahead and sink that so it gives it a
sort<00:06:14.950> of<00:06:15.070> a<00:06:15.220> fresh<00:06:15.840> identification<00:06:16.840> with<00:06:17.350> the

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:17.500 
sort of a fresh identification with the

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.440 
sort of a fresh identification with the
cloud<00:06:17.770> hopefully<00:06:18.490> that's<00:06:18.700> been<00:06:18.820> some<00:06:19.150> helps

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:19.450 
cloud hopefully that's been some helps

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:24.360 
cloud hopefully that's been some helps
you<00:06:19.660> and<00:06:20.310> good<00:06:21.310> luck<00:06:21.340> and<00:06:21.790> enjoy
