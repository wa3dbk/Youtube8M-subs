00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.210 
that my surface is primed and ready to

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.900 
that my surface is primed and ready to
accept<00:00:34.360> my<00:00:34.720> color<00:00:35.129> so<00:00:36.129> just<00:00:36.340> with<00:00:36.460> a<00:00:36.489> brush<00:00:36.730> I'm

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 
accept my color so just with a brush I'm

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.220 
accept my color so just with a brush I'm
gonna<00:00:37.030> put<00:00:37.150> a<00:00:37.180> quite<00:00:37.390> liberal<00:00:37.629> amount<00:00:38.050> of

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230 
gonna put a quite liberal amount of

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.660 
gonna put a quite liberal amount of
gesso<00:00:39.100> on<00:00:39.129> there<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:40.800> all<00:00:41.800> this<00:00:41.980> is<00:00:42.160> doing<00:00:42.339> is

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
gesso on there and all this is doing is

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.750 
gesso on there and all this is doing is
taking<00:00:42.850> the<00:00:43.089> porousness<00:00:43.510> out<00:00:43.900> of<00:00:44.050> my<00:00:44.170> surface

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
taking the porousness out of my surface

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.610 
taking the porousness out of my surface
almost<00:00:45.760> as<00:00:46.030> if<00:00:46.330> it's<00:00:46.510> just<00:00:46.870> preparing<00:00:47.320> so<00:00:47.530> the

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
almost as if it's just preparing so the

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.910 
almost as if it's just preparing so the
color<00:00:47.830> will<00:00:48.040> roll<00:00:48.280> across<00:00:48.519> the<00:00:48.790> top<00:00:49.710> so<00:00:50.710> as<00:00:50.799> you

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
color will roll across the top so as you

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.170 
color will roll across the top so as you
can<00:00:51.040> see<00:00:51.100> I've<00:00:51.400> prepped<00:00:51.699> a<00:00:51.820> whole<00:00:52.000> nother

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
can see I've prepped a whole nother

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.969 
can see I've prepped a whole nother
surface<00:00:52.659> and<00:00:52.809> I've<00:00:52.900> already<00:00:53.140> got<00:00:53.409> my<00:00:53.589> gesso

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:53.979 
surface and I've already got my gesso

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:56.280 
surface and I've already got my gesso
dry<00:00:54.250> and<00:00:54.580> I've<00:00:54.940> already<00:00:55.119> started<00:00:55.449> drawing<00:00:55.989> my

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.290 
dry and I've already started drawing my

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:57.960 
dry and I've already started drawing my
figure<00:00:56.680> now<00:00:57.100> in<00:00:57.250> my<00:00:57.369> original<00:00:57.580> one<00:00:57.940> I

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:57.970 
figure now in my original one I

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:59.820 
figure now in my original one I

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:23.020 
just going to use gelatos double scoop

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.080 
just going to use gelatos double scoop
and<00:01:23.229> I'm<00:01:23.289> gonna<00:01:23.409> trace<00:01:23.740> the<00:01:23.770> outline<00:01:24.340> of<00:01:24.579> the

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
and I'm gonna trace the outline of the

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.719 
and I'm gonna trace the outline of the
lines<00:01:25.329> that<00:01:25.450> I<00:01:25.539> have<00:01:25.780> they're<00:01:26.310> really<00:01:27.310> cool<00:01:27.549> to

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
lines that I have they're really cool to

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:29.340 
lines that I have they're really cool to
note<00:01:27.909> is<00:01:28.090> that<00:01:28.119> because<00:01:28.509> my<00:01:28.689> lines<00:01:28.929> were<00:01:29.109> drawn

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
note is that because my lines were drawn

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.560 
note is that because my lines were drawn
with<00:01:29.380> watercolor<00:01:30.250> that<00:01:30.520> means<00:01:30.939> as<00:01:31.090> I<00:01:31.179> start<00:01:31.450> to

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
with watercolor that means as I start to

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.149 
with watercolor that means as I start to
blend<00:01:31.780> this<00:01:31.899> away<00:01:32.140> my<00:01:32.350> lines<00:01:32.590> will<00:01:32.799> go<00:01:32.920> away

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:33.159 
blend this away my lines will go away

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:34.590 
blend this away my lines will go away
and<00:01:33.280> it<00:01:33.340> will<00:01:33.369> look<00:01:33.609> like<00:01:33.640> it's<00:01:34.090> part<00:01:34.359> of<00:01:34.450> my

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
and it will look like it's part of my

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.179 
and it will look like it's part of my
art<00:01:34.840> not<00:01:35.079> just<00:01:35.109> an<00:01:35.380> outline

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.679 

so<00:01:39.189> I'm<00:01:39.310> just<00:01:39.490> tracing<00:01:39.999> this<00:01:40.149> and<00:01:40.420> I'm<00:01:40.479> really

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:40.689 
so I'm just tracing this and I'm really
