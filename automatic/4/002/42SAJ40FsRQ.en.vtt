00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.810
 I have removed the lid from the 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.810
 trunk 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.060
 why 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:17.110
 finally good at putting'm doing 

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.110
 in the car 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.980
 you can not see much 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.880
 but I'm putting kutxa vinyl 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.880
 what is a chameleon 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:47.700
 notice that it is not worth copying and that 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.810
 want so on vinyl then why not 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.810
 and tell him what 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.910
 that you ask me what can you 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.710
 provide the vinyl you need and the 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.879
 price 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.879
 at the price it has 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.600
 I will not charge more or anything 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:14.820
 this is a chameleon vinyl 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:17.659
 that you can not appreciate much 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.659
 but good 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.110
 good it turns out that to remove the stage 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.000
 it is very easy 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.580
 this is the lid 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.580
 Well, these gaps here have a 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.530
 each screw 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.610
 then you have to remove the screw 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.980
 here 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:43.080
 and I removed the caps these from the 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.080
 sides to be able to reach in and stretch 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.229
 I will know 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.820
 as you can see in the part this has 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.320
 some anchors 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.320
 which are hooked 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.890
 3 are the sides 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.890
 2 below 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.590
 and two on the top 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.440
 this is emma broken but the only thing there 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:13.290
 what to do is stretch 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:17.450
 you have to stretch hard 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.450
 and if you leave one you put it back 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.770
 as I said before for those who want 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.770
 remain vinyl 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.400
 it can be appreciated 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.830
 the light change 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.180
 it's a chameleon vinyl 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.319
 that I can also 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.620
 so that I want it 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.970
 that was sticking happened 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.860

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:43.350
