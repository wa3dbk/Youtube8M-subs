00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
shoe once you're done with that just

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.690 
shoe once you're done with that just
lace<00:03:19.300> your<00:03:19.480> shoe<00:03:19.720> up<00:03:20.020> then<00:03:20.860> you're<00:03:21.250> done<00:03:21.430> I

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
lace your shoe up then you're done I

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.850 
lace your shoe up then you're done I
would<00:03:22.180> recommend<00:03:22.840> not<00:03:23.020> wearing<00:03:23.410> your<00:03:23.560> shoes

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
would recommend not wearing your shoes

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.360 
would recommend not wearing your shoes
for<00:03:24.580> a<00:03:24.610> day<00:03:24.850> or<00:03:25.000> two<00:03:25.030> just<00:03:25.600> because<00:03:26.110> it<00:03:26.980> might

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
for a day or two just because it might

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.640 
for a day or two just because it might
not<00:03:27.520> be<00:03:27.820> completely<00:03:28.270> dry<00:03:28.570> in<00:03:28.720> some<00:03:28.930> spots<00:03:29.200> so

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
not be completely dry in some spots so

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.810 
not be completely dry in some spots so
that's<00:03:30.220> just<00:03:30.430> a<00:03:30.640> safety<00:03:30.880> precaution

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
that's just a safety precaution

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.090 
that's just a safety precaution
once<00:03:33.820> your<00:03:34.000> shoes<00:03:34.210> all<00:03:34.450> done<00:03:34.750> for<00:03:35.410> storage<00:03:35.890> I

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
once your shoes all done for storage I

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.820 
once your shoes all done for storage I
would<00:03:36.310> recommend<00:03:36.820> that<00:03:37.090> you<00:03:37.450> do<00:03:37.810> put<00:03:38.500> your
