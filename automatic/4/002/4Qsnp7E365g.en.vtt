here<00:00:04.840> we<00:00:05.200> like<00:00:05.470> it

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:08.559 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:11.580 

we<00:00:09.070> brought<00:00:09.549> the<00:00:10.330> air<00:00:10.570> fitting<00:00:11.290> it

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:11.590 
we brought the air fitting it

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.170 
we brought the air fitting it
underground<00:00:12.400> the<00:00:12.670> fresh<00:00:12.879> air<00:00:13.059> from

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:13.180 
underground the fresh air from

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.570 
underground the fresh air from
underground<00:00:13.690> under<00:00:14.110> here<00:00:14.349> from<00:00:14.889> that<00:00:15.070> area<00:00:15.309> of

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:15.580 
underground under here from that area of

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.749 
underground under here from that area of
trees<00:00:15.990> near<00:00:16.990> the<00:00:17.020> idea<00:00:17.349> that<00:00:17.590> there<00:00:17.800> was<00:00:18.009> so<00:00:18.490> we

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:18.759 
trees near the idea that there was so we

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:20.609 
trees near the idea that there was so we
hope<00:00:19.210> to<00:00:19.240> maybe<00:00:19.570> a<00:00:19.689> better<00:00:19.840> quality<00:00:20.169> of<00:00:20.439> there

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:20.619 
hope to maybe a better quality of there

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:24.540 
hope to maybe a better quality of there
may<00:00:20.860> be<00:00:20.890> some<00:00:21.930> more<00:00:22.930> oxygen<00:00:23.079> on<00:00:23.560> us<00:00:23.680> to<00:00:24.430> bring

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:24.550 
may be some more oxygen on us to bring

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.760 
may be some more oxygen on us to bring
it<00:00:24.730> an<00:00:24.880> announcer<00:00:25.480> defeated<00:00:25.960> war<00:00:26.140> and<00:00:26.349> the

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:26.770 
it an announcer defeated war and the

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.459 
it an announcer defeated war and the
ideas<00:00:27.220> whale<00:00:27.550> is<00:00:27.820> it<00:00:28.029> lowers<00:00:28.630> the<00:00:28.779> parameters

00:00:29.459 --> 00:00:29.469 
ideas whale is it lowers the parameters

00:00:29.469 --> 00:00:34.500 
ideas whale is it lowers the parameters
of<00:00:29.680> the<00:00:30.599> weather<00:00:31.599> whose<00:00:32.410> effort<00:00:33.160> was<00:00:33.340> C<00:00:34.120> plus

would<00:00:43.030> hit<00:00:43.210> the<00:00:43.239> machine<00:00:43.690> so<00:00:44.550> you're<00:00:45.550> not<00:00:45.670> as

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:45.879 
would hit the machine so you're not as

way to margins and you have such

00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:50.279 
way to margins and you have such
basically<00:00:48.820> outside<00:00:48.969> although<00:00:49.899> in<00:00:50.019> the<00:00:50.109> legs

00:00:50.279 --> 00:00:50.289 
basically outside although in the legs

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:52.290 
basically outside although in the legs
have<00:00:50.499> here<00:00:50.829> that's<00:00:51.309> our<00:00:51.519> lugli<00:00:51.760> and<00:00:52.089> water

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
have here that's our lugli and water

have here that's our lugli and water
harvester<00:00:53.079> okay<00:00:53.679> as<00:00:54.129> you<00:00:54.280> see<00:00:54.429> it's<00:00:54.670> just

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
harvester okay as you see it's just

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.270 
harvester okay as you see it's just
gravity<00:00:55.300> and<00:00:55.809> say<00:00:55.929> a<00:00:55.960> tank<00:00:56.260> that<00:00:56.649> flushes<00:00:56.980> with

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
gravity and say a tank that flushes with

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.220 
gravity and say a tank that flushes with
three<00:00:57.460> toilets<00:00:57.760> and<00:00:58.359> it<00:00:58.449> has<00:00:58.569> no<00:00:58.719> problem

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 
three toilets and it has no problem

three toilets and it has no problem
there

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
there

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.520 
there
I<00:00:59.649> think<00:01:00.190> a<00:01:00.249> millimeter<00:01:00.729> of<00:01:00.819> rien<00:01:01.359> will<00:01:02.199> flush

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
I think a millimeter of rien will flush

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.369 
I think a millimeter of rien will flush
them<00:01:02.829> for<00:01:03.339> a<00:01:03.519> week<00:01:03.900> push<00:01:04.900> the<00:01:05.019> three<00:01:05.170> toilets

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
them for a week push the three toilets

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.760 
them for a week push the three toilets
for<00:01:05.770> a<00:01:05.800> week<00:01:05.920> I<00:01:06.210> ask<00:01:07.210> only<00:01:07.390> here<00:01:07.750> soldiers<00:01:08.590> here

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
for a week I ask only here soldiers here

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.320 
for a week I ask only here soldiers here
that<00:01:09.010> there's<00:01:09.190> nothing<00:01:09.580> to<00:01:09.729> begin<00:01:10.150> by

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
that there's nothing to begin by

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.380 
that there's nothing to begin by
harvesting<00:01:10.540> water<00:01:11.490> so<00:01:12.490> we<00:01:12.909> haven't<00:01:13.270> done

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
harvesting water so we haven't done

anything<00:01:13.719> of<00:01:14.049> any<00:01:14.409> expense<00:01:15.210> but<00:01:16.210> works

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:16.649 
anything of any expense but works

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:18.630 
anything of any expense but works
prepared<00:01:17.649> you<00:01:17.799> systems<00:01:18.219> are<00:01:18.340> just<00:01:18.490> too

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
prepared you systems are just too

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.039 
prepared you systems are just too
expensive<00:01:18.670> you<00:01:19.210> don't<00:01:19.450> get<00:01:19.600> to<00:01:19.719> do<00:01:19.840> that

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:20.049 
expensive you don't get to do that

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:22.560 
expensive you don't get to do that
your<00:01:20.829> brigade<00:01:20.979> never<00:01:21.369> patience<00:01:21.759> that<00:01:22.299> works

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
your brigade never patience that works

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.840 
your brigade never patience that works
I'm<00:01:22.750> a<00:01:22.780> say<00:01:23.110> for<00:01:23.140> example<00:01:23.619> that<00:01:23.740> you'd<00:01:24.640> leave

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
I'm a say for example that you'd leave

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.050 
I'm a say for example that you'd leave
stuff<00:01:25.090> in<00:01:25.240> the<00:01:25.329> paper<00:01:25.590> England<00:01:26.610> I<00:01:27.610> thought<00:01:27.850> no

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
stuff in the paper England I thought no

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.840
