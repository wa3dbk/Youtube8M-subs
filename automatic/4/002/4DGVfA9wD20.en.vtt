00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:07.649
 so big hello to everyone immediately want 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:10.139
 say what I think everyone 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.509
 it is understandable to an adequate person that not all 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.150
 can install there yourself 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.010
 there are programs 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.980
 born there computer scientists there 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.619
 experienced windows and socket users 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:27.560
 put there to connect appliances and other 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:31.109
 things I ran literally a year ago 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:34.469
 The following problems have acquired a monitor 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:37.950
 before the product seemed to be the principle 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:40.710
 quality as I arrange everything 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.290
 throughout the year I use it and can 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.840
 say that eyes don't get tired like i 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:51.480
 I work and copywriters with this builders 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:54.239
 And now I do video blogging 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.969
 I can recommend it 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.399
 to people who search there and monitor in 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.309
 This case is my model principle 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:05.030
 worthy and so what happened to me 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:08.970
 what happened next I hooked up there 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:12.510
 monitor and system unit using here 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:16.140
 I don't know this frame in my opinion and I or 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.850
 The scheme is called I can be wrong in short 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.100
 with the help of this blue cable and 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.430
 connected the monitor to the computer 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.369
 but everything will work there installed 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:30.210
 drivers that I had and if u 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:32.159
 someone no wood for monitor download 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:37.250

 so much there do not go under the table and stones 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:01.079

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.079
 Well, I do not know Duma juice shut off normally 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:06.390
 several times the driver reinstalled 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:07.820
 ran in there added and I do not know already 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.670

 output connect to a standard monitor 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:40.820
 I have such a successful system unit 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.680
