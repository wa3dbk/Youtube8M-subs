00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:12.760
 hello youtube are ipad 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:15.850
 welcome to this brand new video 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:18.520
 today we talk about racing titles again 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.990
 of simulators of everything 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.700
 in this case we are talking about ai 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.360
 racing because as you have seen from 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:27.250
 facebook fan page to which I beg you 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.230
 to put a you like in case you want 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.290
 be updated even more on the news 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:35.649
 of hyper tv gaming well I said that 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:38.260
 I bought at racing racing is a 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:40.300
 subscription driving simulator and there is 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.660
 an ongoing promotion with 12 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:46.570
 dollars the price that is normally for 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.219
 a month's license gives you two more 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.230
 free months so it's three months in 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:53.019
 all 12 dollars or wanted to try it seen 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.120
 that some of you told me it was 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:56.350
 an excellent one on the engine and in fact it is the 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.960
 best he had tried so far 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.239
 not just for the driving model it is 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.850
 I think the graphics are very faithful 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:06.610
 it is slightly worse indeed 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.770
 compared to the race set, however, there are 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.350
 other merits that is the multiplayer that 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.230
 organized very well because it is behind it 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.060
 a league that keeps us very much being 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:19.090
 the developers play by subscription 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.450
 they are very much behind the contents is 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:24.340
 substantially multiple because it is so 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.680
 fun and beautiful to play because 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.640
 they are all correct in the moment 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.210
 where you buy the game and yes 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.740
 accept the conditions and there is a guide 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.330
 that you are seeing under your own to whom 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.790
 at this time I split notes and 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.130
 the last point is precisely correctness 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.780
 and the ethics that you must keep while you are 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.700
 guide actually you notice this 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.190
 behavior already in rookie races 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.830
 those practically for beginners who 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.270
 I'm doing it now that you see in 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:51.850
 this time even the players 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.230
 inexperienced then try to hold the 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.540
 loyal behavior more possible 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:58.990
 sure every now and then the car runs away either 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:02.050
 some accident as in my case 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.530
 you will have seen it after a great start 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.540
 However 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.030
 okay has happened what do I do I have to 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.399
 pay him something insurance does not exist 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.590
 I want to say oh well anyway 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.209
 it happens but the important thing is that the will 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.750
 of the player to drive in a race 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:19.580
 true and not go to run mare as on 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.640
 battlefield jets got on people 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:26.450
 which unfortunately ruins all the games 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:29.330
 driving a little less sim see f1 on f1 ci 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.069
 it's a lot of bm that just started 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.920
 the race at the first variant try to 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.930
 come in and then there are the 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.970
 penalty all the good stuff maybe 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.500
 race wins the same, but you didn't 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.330
 amused because you have not simulated 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.480
 enough race situation and here 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.580
 we come to the simulation of the 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:49.819
 tender situation because they reopen 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.319
 recruitment on the h tg clan because 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:54.650
 as I told you I would have also treated 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:56.209
 However, there are new driving games 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.680
 conditions 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.959
 the limit behind this time 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.900
 lower to 15 years so let's see 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:05.330
 give someone more opportunity but 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:08.930
 I limit these recruitment to people 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:11.750
 strongly strongly interested in 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:15.560
 driving titles more than at battlefield or 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:18.200
 at least 50 and 50 we will not recruit people 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.790
 who play only battlefields have 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.010
 patience we will make these recruitments 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.480
 changing the rules a bit over time la 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.150
 the community we build will always be more 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.410
 big however as I said above I want to do it 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.019
 well so be patient I already have 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.239
 all written on a sheet of paper e 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:35.660
 I'm organizing everything for then came 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:37.549
 recruitments open from the moment 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.859
 you have seen this video and i am 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:42.530
 addressed to title lovers 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:45.260
 racing because I want to create a 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:48.200
 sort of stable team hpg that 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:50.540
 will run all the titles a little more 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.160
 beautiful of races which are these titles 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.560
 because maybe you also want to know 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.970
 rightly you have racing because I got it 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.470
 yesterday so we can play together 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.140
 cheerfully and then 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.820
 lovers of formula 1 titles of 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.460
 codemasters even if they are not really 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.720
 simulative but surely if we are in 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.670
 a dozen and we will manage to organize 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.990
 of competitions between correct people who 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:14.070
 at least they can send themselves to that country 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:15.720
 when they beat against each other and I would say then 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.310
 I set up racing project cards though 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.780
 unfortunately they have a small flaw ie 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.030
 have not yet come out in version 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.480
 definitive and therefore we will have to wait for a 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.810
 little 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:27.960
 in any case we recruit gods 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:30.330
 fans of simulation racing titles 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.890
 and not driving but that you still play in 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.340
 at least one of these titles is something 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:37.290
 as formula 1 is something like racing 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:40.740
 race setup if someone gt r se 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:42.630
 then some rfactor gets organized 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.340
 I hope I made someone find out 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.960
 of you to racing I put the link in 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.400
 descriptions so you can go 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.220
 to check for a moment how much they cost 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.530
 rates if worth it I warn you 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:55.590
 already that you will have a pack included 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.600
 at the beginning of the purchase than seven 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.970
 cars and 56 tracks and then for 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.830
 buy other cars as cars a 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.710
 open wheels very similar shape 1 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:07.320
 you'll have to pay them for $ 11 each 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.720
 I made two accounts and play the remains 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.820
 indecently of the purchase of 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:13.230
 at least two machines that are not in 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.479
 those included that is about twenty 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:17.400
 dollars plus an annual subscription that 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:20.490
 is around 100 dollars all 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.169
 counts should do about 90 euros counting 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.180
 all the conversion really dollar and 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:25.560
 there is but to start these 12 dollars of 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.060
 they will entertain for three months and there 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.160
 I recommend doing it because for 10 euros 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.690
 you will have a great simulation under your hands 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.390
 you can even drive cars already 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:35.430
 well placed see you in the next 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:38.270
