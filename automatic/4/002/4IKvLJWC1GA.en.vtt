00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:31.530 
made it a paper motion but this is just
for<00:00:26.119> fun<00:00:26.289> it<00:00:27.289> doesn't<00:00:27.349> work<00:00:28.070> so<00:00:28.599> pupae<00:00:29.599> demands

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:31.540

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.370 
so yeah here got a wolf right thing so

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.260 
so yeah here got a wolf right thing so
the<00:00:37.370> mechanism<00:00:38.090> is<00:00:38.620> not<00:00:39.620> the<00:00:40.010> same<00:00:40.310> totally

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
the mechanism is not the same totally

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.870 
the mechanism is not the same totally
different<00:00:41.720> so<00:00:42.020> yeah<00:00:42.940> let<00:00:43.940> me<00:00:43.970> demo<00:00:45.520> yep<00:00:46.550> it

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:46.880 
different so yeah let me demo yep it

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.970 
different so yeah let me demo yep it
doesn't<00:00:47.360> fall<00:00:47.570> off<00:00:47.750> because<00:00:48.200> of<00:00:48.560> the<00:00:48.740> valve

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
doesn't fall off because of the valve

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:49.570 
doesn't fall off because of the valve
thing

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:49.580 
thing

00:00:49.580 --> 00:01:03.850 
thing
and<00:00:50.080> here<00:00:51.080> comes<00:00:51.380> again<00:00:52.390> yo<00:00:53.440> see<00:01:02.410> see<00:01:03.410> it

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
and here comes again yo see see it

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:13.109 
and here comes again yo see see it
doesn't<00:01:04.430> fall<00:01:04.670> off<00:01:04.699> course<00:01:05.230> less<00:01:06.230> about<00:01:06.530> them

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:13.119 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:22.919 

Oh<00:01:16.979> sometimes<00:01:17.979> it<00:01:18.280> goes<00:01:19.149> wrong<00:01:21.450> now<00:01:22.450> I<00:01:22.719> think

00:01:22.919 --> 00:01:22.929 
Oh sometimes it goes wrong now I think

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:24.240 
Oh sometimes it goes wrong now I think
it's<00:01:23.319> fine

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
it's fine

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.469 
it's fine
so<00:01:25.289> it's<00:01:26.289> stuck<00:01:26.740> inside<00:01:27.039> to<00:01:27.490> release<00:01:27.759> them<00:01:28.179> if

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
so it's stuck inside to release them if

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:43.840 
so it's stuck inside to release them if
you<00:01:28.780> use<00:01:30.179> the<00:01:31.179> connector<00:01:33.000> as<00:01:34.020> shown<00:01:35.159> like<00:01:36.159> this

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:50.410 

so<00:01:44.450> you<00:01:44.510> step<00:01:45.140> that<00:01:45.410> in<00:01:47.410> and<00:01:48.640> it<00:01:49.640> release<00:01:50.120> all

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
so you step that in and it release all

00:01:50.420 --> 00:02:00.660 
so you step that in and it release all
the<00:01:50.810> marbles<00:01:52.330> see<00:01:58.090> I'll<00:01:59.090> explain<00:01:59.720> it<00:01:59.930> now

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
the marbles see I'll explain it now

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:08.560 
the marbles see I'll explain it now
there's<00:02:01.670> some<00:02:02.060> inside<00:02:03.520> so<00:02:04.520> this<00:02:05.360> valve<00:02:05.780> I<00:02:07.570> take

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
there's some inside so this valve I take

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.050 
there's some inside so this valve I take
some<00:02:08.840> tape<00:02:09.259> to<00:02:09.290> tension<00:02:10.040> inside<00:02:10.460> so<00:02:10.729> it<00:02:10.910> only

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
some tape to tension inside so it only

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.110 
some tape to tension inside so it only
can<00:02:11.450> flap<00:02:11.930> in<00:02:12.170> but<00:02:12.650> not<00:02:12.860> out<00:02:12.920> you<00:02:13.400> see<00:02:13.580> it<00:02:13.760> it's

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
can flap in but not out you see it it's

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.990 
can flap in but not out you see it it's
difficult<00:02:14.390> for<00:02:14.870> it<00:02:14.990> to<00:02:15.040> come<00:02:16.040> up<00:02:16.160> is<00:02:16.520> easy<00:02:16.700> for

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
difficult for it to come up is easy for

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.490 
difficult for it to come up is easy for
it<00:02:17.120> going<00:02:17.720> same<00:02:18.680> on<00:02:18.860> the<00:02:18.980> other<00:02:19.010> side<00:02:19.250> too<00:02:19.670> so

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
it going same on the other side too so

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.470 
it going same on the other side too so
it's<00:02:21.500> still<00:02:21.830> the<00:02:21.980> same<00:02:22.280> when<00:02:22.820> it<00:02:22.970> works<00:02:23.180> on<00:02:23.360> my

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
it's still the same when it works on my

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.760 
it's still the same when it works on my
finger<00:02:23.900> so<00:02:23.930> I<00:02:24.730> can<00:02:25.730> put<00:02:26.270> into<00:02:26.480> it<00:02:26.930> easily<00:02:27.380> but<00:02:27.620> I

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
finger so I can put into it easily but I

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:33.340 
finger so I can put into it easily but I
can't<00:02:28.100> put<00:02:28.340> out<00:02:28.520> it<00:02:29.380> it<00:02:30.380> might<00:02:32.200> feel<00:02:33.200> a<00:02:33.320> little

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
can't put out it it might feel a little

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:43.990 
can't put out it it might feel a little
hard<00:02:34.660> my<00:02:35.660> thumb<00:02:35.989> yep<00:02:39.520> so<00:02:42.250> when<00:02:43.250> the<00:02:43.489> marble

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
hard my thumb yep so when the marble

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:52.780 
hard my thumb yep so when the marble
goes<00:02:44.330> in<00:02:47.590> and<00:02:49.540> it<00:02:50.540> pops<00:02:51.110> right<00:02:51.470> back<00:02:51.530> up<00:02:51.800> so<00:02:52.340> it

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
goes in and it pops right back up so it

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.400 
goes in and it pops right back up so it
can<00:02:53.360> let<00:02:54.110> the<00:02:54.380> mob<00:02:54.709> escape<00:02:55.989> until<00:02:56.989> you<00:02:57.140> use

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
can let the mob escape until you use

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:04.900 
can let the mob escape until you use
this<00:02:58.000> it<00:02:59.000> has<00:02:59.570> two<00:03:00.370> flaps<00:03:01.370> here<00:03:03.280> and<00:03:04.280> you<00:03:04.760> will

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
this it has two flaps here and you will

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:10.720 
this it has two flaps here and you will
put<00:03:05.150> in<00:03:05.420> like<00:03:05.660> this

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.790 

so<00:03:11.450> it<00:03:12.010> expands<00:03:13.010> you<00:03:13.930> this<00:03:14.930> has<00:03:15.170> to<00:03:15.380> be<00:03:15.560> very

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
so it expands you this has to be very

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.600 
so it expands you this has to be very
strong<00:03:16.400> to<00:03:16.840> expand<00:03:17.840> the<00:03:18.230> flames<00:03:18.590> to<00:03:18.980> and<00:03:19.220> let

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
strong to expand the flames to and let

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:32.270 
strong to expand the flames to and let
the<00:03:19.819> mob<00:03:20.090> out<00:03:20.390> so<00:03:21.610> I'll<00:03:22.610> show<00:03:23.150> you

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.759 

oops

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:40.520 
oops
yep<00:03:35.769> I<00:03:35.980> think<00:03:36.099> it's<00:03:36.610> stuck<00:03:37.360> right<00:03:37.719> here

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.869 

this<00:03:41.530> won't<00:03:42.370> work<00:03:42.579> on<00:03:43.349> big<00:03:44.349> cows<00:03:44.680> maybe<00:03:45.310> just

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:45.879 
this won't work on big cows maybe just

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:52.890 
this won't work on big cows maybe just
works<00:03:46.269> hold<00:03:48.390> smaller<00:03:49.390> marbles<00:03:50.370> so<00:03:51.629> touch<00:03:52.629> it

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
works hold smaller marbles so touch it

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
works hold smaller marbles so touch it
up<00:03:53.079> and<00:03:53.489> you<00:03:54.489> are<00:03:54.670> ready<00:03:54.879> to<00:03:54.970> go<00:03:56.549> see<00:03:58.650> so<00:03:59.650> what
