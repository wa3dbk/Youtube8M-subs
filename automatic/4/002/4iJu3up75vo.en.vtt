dynamics trainer so this piece of
equipment<00:00:08.760> when<00:00:08.880> I<00:00:08.910> was<00:00:09.059> first<00:00:09.210> approached

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
equipment when I was first approached

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.209 
equipment when I was first approached
about<00:00:09.780> doing<00:00:09.870> a<00:00:10.110> review<00:00:10.290> I<00:00:10.410> said<00:00:10.679> yes<00:00:10.920> because

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
about doing a review I said yes because

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:12.320 
about doing a review I said yes because
that's<00:00:11.519> my<00:00:11.849> job

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
that's my job

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.620 
that's my job
but<00:00:12.809> I<00:00:13.200> wasn't<00:00:14.190> actually<00:00:14.670> expecting<00:00:14.940> to<00:00:15.480> like

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
but I wasn't actually expecting to like

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.810 
but I wasn't actually expecting to like
it<00:00:15.839> very<00:00:15.870> much<00:00:16.260> when<00:00:16.619> I<00:00:16.680> watched<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.190> videos<00:00:17.520> I

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
it very much when I watched the videos I

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.179 
it very much when I watched the videos I
just<00:00:18.119> felt<00:00:18.359> like<00:00:18.420> it<00:00:18.720> seemed<00:00:19.230> constricting

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
just felt like it seemed constricting

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.070 
just felt like it seemed constricting
standing<00:00:20.970> on<00:00:21.060> this<00:00:21.150> piece<00:00:21.330> of<00:00:21.449> plastic<00:00:21.900> and

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
standing on this piece of plastic and

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.990 
standing on this piece of plastic and
not<00:00:22.170> really<00:00:22.380> moving<00:00:22.590> around<00:00:22.740> a<00:00:22.890> whole<00:00:23.010> lot<00:00:23.039> but

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
not really moving around a whole lot but

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.290 
not really moving around a whole lot but
I<00:00:24.390> do<00:00:24.660> have<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:24.990> say<00:00:25.109> I'm<00:00:25.199> pretty<00:00:26.300> pleasantly

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
I do have to say I'm pretty pleasantly

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.169 
I do have to say I'm pretty pleasantly
surprised<00:00:27.720> about<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.320> piece<00:00:28.560> of<00:00:28.710> equipment

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:29.179 
surprised about the piece of equipment

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:32.810 
surprised about the piece of equipment
so<00:00:30.179> what<00:00:30.420> it<00:00:30.539> is<00:00:30.810> is<00:00:31.140> it's<00:00:31.980> basically<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.520> pulley

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
so what it is is it's basically a pulley

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.479 
so what it is is it's basically a pulley
system<00:00:32.910> using<00:00:33.570> bands<00:00:33.809> so<00:00:34.410> you<00:00:34.469> have<00:00:34.770> your<00:00:35.280> base

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
system using bands so you have your base

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.819 
system using bands so you have your base
which<00:00:35.910> is<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.120> nice<00:00:36.329> sturdy<00:00:36.600> piece<00:00:36.899> of<00:00:37.110> plastic

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
which is a nice sturdy piece of plastic

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.450 
which is a nice sturdy piece of plastic
that<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:39.000> pulley<00:00:39.360> system<00:00:39.480> works<00:00:40.440> from<00:00:40.770> you

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
that the pulley system works from you

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.110 
that the pulley system works from you
have<00:00:41.960> rotational<00:00:42.960> pieces<00:00:43.440> of<00:00:43.879> plastic<00:00:44.879> here

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
have rotational pieces of plastic here

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.880 
have rotational pieces of plastic here
where<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.450> pulley<00:00:45.690> actually<00:00:46.260> goes<00:00:46.469> back<00:00:46.649> and

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
where the pulley actually goes back and

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.439 
where the pulley actually goes back and
forth<00:00:46.969> you<00:00:47.969> have<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.300> band<00:00:48.539> system<00:00:49.320> itself

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
forth you have the band system itself

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:53.510 
forth you have the band system itself
and<00:00:51.449> then<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:51.719> have<00:00:51.930> two<00:00:52.590> ankle<00:00:52.949> cuffs<00:00:53.190> and

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
and then you have two ankle cuffs and

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.500 
and then you have two ankle cuffs and
two<00:00:54.230> hand<00:00:55.230> holds<00:00:55.760> every<00:00:56.760> set<00:00:57.059> comes<00:00:57.390> with

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
two hand holds every set comes with

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.380 
two hand holds every set comes with
three<00:00:57.600> of<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.949> easy<00:00:59.190> bands<00:00:59.489> three<00:01:00.090> of<00:01:00.270> the

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
three of the easy bands three of the

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.790 
three of the easy bands three of the
medium<00:01:00.719> bands<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.199> then<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:01.410> can<00:01:01.559> purchase

more<00:01:05.790> resistance<00:01:06.360> I've<00:01:06.869> been<00:01:07.200> using<00:01:07.439> the

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
more resistance I've been using the

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.560 
more resistance I've been using the
strong<00:01:08.100> bands<00:01:08.369> for<00:01:08.700> my<00:01:08.820> workouts<00:01:09.240> for<00:01:09.510> the

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.250 
purposes of this review I'm just doing
the<00:01:11.310> easy<00:01:11.430> bands<00:01:11.790> just<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.210> be<00:01:12.299> able<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.540> show

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
the easy bands just to be able to show

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.870 
the easy bands just to be able to show
you<00:01:13.320> without<00:01:13.530> huffing<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.189> puffing<00:01:14.310> too<00:01:14.700> much

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880

this<00:01:18.960> one<00:01:19.259> already<00:01:19.590> set<00:01:19.950> up<00:01:19.979> you'll<00:01:20.670> see<00:01:20.909> that

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
this one already set up you'll see that

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.810 
this one already set up you'll see that
because<00:01:22.320> of<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.830> rotational<00:01:23.460> piece<00:01:23.670> of

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
because of the rotational piece of

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.359 
because of the rotational piece of
plastic<00:01:24.180> here<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:25.170> band<00:01:25.590> moves<00:01:25.920> really

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
plastic here the band moves really

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.440 
plastic here the band moves really
easily<00:01:26.909> across<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:29.009> pulley<00:01:29.400> you<00:01:30.270> have

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
easily across the the pulley you have

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.640 
easily across the the pulley you have
your<00:01:30.600> ankle<00:01:30.930> cuff<00:01:31.140> on<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.670> inside<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:33.000> the

your ankle cuff on the inside and the
handhold<00:01:34.650> on<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.100> outside<00:01:35.549> it's<00:01:36.390> really<00:01:36.659> easy

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
handhold on the outside it's really easy

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.179 
handhold on the outside it's really easy
to<00:01:37.049> put<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.320> together<00:01:37.439> so<00:01:37.680> I've<00:01:37.950> got<00:01:38.100> another

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
to put it together so I've got another

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.190 
to put it together so I've got another
easy<00:01:38.610> band<00:01:38.880> over<00:01:39.210> here<00:01:39.240> on<00:01:39.479> this<00:01:39.659> side<00:01:39.900> you

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
that you don't you know you can use the

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.999 
that you don't you know you can use the
mat<00:02:02.700> as<00:02:02.939> an<00:02:03.180> actual<00:02:03.540> mat<00:02:03.750> which<00:02:03.990> is<00:02:04.170> true<00:02:04.469> or

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
mat as an actual mat which is true or

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.570 
mat as an actual mat which is true or
you<00:02:05.219> can<00:02:05.369> use<00:02:05.549> it<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:06.590> provide<00:02:07.590> more<00:02:07.950> of<00:02:08.340> a

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
you can use it to provide more of a

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.540 
you can use it to provide more of a
steady<00:02:08.910> base<00:02:09.270> for<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.899> base<00:02:10.229> itself

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
steady base for the base itself

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.090 
steady base for the base itself
um<00:02:11.640> and<00:02:12.300> then<00:02:12.600> you<00:02:12.780> also<00:02:12.930> do<00:02:13.200> this<00:02:13.530> comes<00:02:13.860> with

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
um and then you also do this comes with

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.800 
um and then you also do this comes with
the<00:02:14.160> set<00:02:14.490> as<00:02:14.670> well<00:02:14.880> it's<00:02:15.150> a<00:02:15.240> nice<00:02:15.360> little<00:02:15.420> bag

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
the set as well it's a nice little bag

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.290 
the set as well it's a nice little bag
you<00:02:15.840> can<00:02:16.170> put<00:02:16.320> all<00:02:16.440> your<00:02:16.680> your<00:02:17.430> straps<00:02:17.880> in<00:02:18.150> it

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
you can put all your your straps in it

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.820 
you can put all your your straps in it
and<00:02:18.570> put<00:02:19.230> them<00:02:19.350> away

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
and put them away

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.550 
and put them away
not<00:02:20.100> lose<00:02:20.310> them<00:02:20.490> which<00:02:21.060> is<00:02:21.240> good<00:02:21.450> so<00:02:22.410> basically

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
not lose them which is good so basically

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.850 
not lose them which is good so basically
how<00:02:22.980> this<00:02:23.160> works<00:02:23.780> is<00:02:24.780> you're<00:02:24.990> going<00:02:25.140> to<00:02:25.290> strap

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
how this works is you're going to strap

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:32.210 
how this works is you're going to strap
in<00:02:27.620> an<00:02:28.620> ankle<00:02:30.020> strap<00:02:31.020> in<00:02:31.290> your<00:02:31.470> other<00:02:31.620> ankle

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
in an ankle strap in your other ankle

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.400 
in an ankle strap in your other ankle
I<00:02:32.990> suggest<00:02:34.310> wearing<00:02:35.310> shoes<00:02:36.030> with<00:02:36.060> this<00:02:36.480> first

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
I suggest wearing shoes with this first

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.410 
I suggest wearing shoes with this first
time<00:02:37.620> I<00:02:37.650> put<00:02:37.920> it<00:02:38.070> on<00:02:38.190> I<00:02:38.580> did<00:02:38.940> something<00:02:39.300> stupid

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
time I put it on I did something stupid

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.350 
time I put it on I did something stupid
and<00:02:40.050> ended<00:02:40.500> up<00:02:40.680> hurting<00:02:41.040> my<00:02:41.280> toe<00:02:41.340> because<00:02:42.030> I

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
and ended up hurting my toe because I

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.200 
and ended up hurting my toe because I
did<00:02:43.200> something<00:02:43.560> stupid<00:02:43.650> but<00:02:44.100> so<00:02:44.970> then<00:02:45.120> you

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
did something stupid but so then you

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.630 
did something stupid but so then you
grab<00:02:45.420> your<00:02:45.450> hand<00:02:45.840> straps<00:02:46.170> you<00:02:46.830> stand<00:02:47.130> up<00:02:47.340> and

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
grab your hand straps you stand up and

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.270 
grab your hand straps you stand up and
now<00:02:48.240> you<00:02:48.300> see<00:02:48.660> how<00:02:48.900> every<00:02:49.320> move<00:02:49.650> you<00:02:49.830> make<00:02:50.040> is

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
now you see how every move you make is

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.390 
now you see how every move you make is
going<00:02:51.180> to<00:02:51.360> face<00:02:51.600> resistance<00:02:52.320> because<00:02:53.190> you've

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
going to face resistance because you've

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.000 
going to face resistance because you've
got<00:02:53.550> your<00:02:53.580> hands<00:02:54.320> providing<00:02:55.320> resistance

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
got your hands providing resistance

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.680 
got your hands providing resistance
you've<00:02:56.370> got<00:02:56.580> your<00:02:56.700> ankles<00:02:57.150> providing

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
you've got your ankles providing

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.990 
you've got your ankles providing
resistance<00:02:57.960> so<00:02:58.710> now<00:02:58.860> no<00:02:59.070> matter<00:02:59.220> what<00:02:59.520> you<00:02:59.580> do

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
resistance so now no matter what you do

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.450 
resistance so now no matter what you do
you're<00:03:00.600> receiving<00:03:01.290> resistance<00:03:02.040> in<00:03:02.250> your

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
you're receiving resistance in your

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.490 
you're receiving resistance in your
upper<00:03:02.760> and<00:03:02.790> your<00:03:03.120> lower<00:03:03.240> body<00:03:03.690> which<00:03:04.320> is

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
upper and your lower body which is

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.640 
upper and your lower body which is
exactly<00:03:05.040> why<00:03:05.370> it's<00:03:06.120> an<00:03:06.630> effective<00:03:07.170> piece<00:03:07.470> of

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
exactly why it's an effective piece of

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.830 
exactly why it's an effective piece of
equipment<00:03:08.180> some<00:03:09.180> of<00:03:09.270> the<00:03:09.420> things<00:03:09.630> I've<00:03:09.810> been

equipment some of the things I've been
doing<00:03:10.020> and<00:03:10.560> these<00:03:10.860> aren't<00:03:11.040> things<00:03:11.220> I<00:03:11.400> actually

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
doing and these aren't things I actually

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.160 
doing and these aren't things I actually
saw<00:03:11.880> in<00:03:11.970> their<00:03:12.120> website<00:03:12.480> they<00:03:12.660> have<00:03:12.780> a<00:03:12.810> lot<00:03:13.140> of

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
saw in their website they have a lot of

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.290 
saw in their website they have a lot of
videos<00:03:13.560> on<00:03:13.710> their<00:03:13.830> website<00:03:13.880> but<00:03:14.880> one<00:03:15.090> of<00:03:15.210> the

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
videos on their website but one of the

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.000 
videos on their website but one of the
things<00:03:15.540> I've<00:03:15.750> been<00:03:15.780> doing<00:03:15.989> is<00:03:16.739> actually

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
things I've been doing is actually

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.190 
things I've been doing is actually
running<00:03:17.520> in<00:03:17.760> place<00:03:17.910> you<00:03:18.630> do<00:03:18.780> have<00:03:18.989> to<00:03:19.110> be

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
running in place you do have to be

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.710 
running in place you do have to be
careful<00:03:19.410> and<00:03:20.160> this<00:03:20.280> is<00:03:20.430> why<00:03:20.580> this<00:03:21.360> is<00:03:21.570> the

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
careful and this is why this is the

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.240 
careful and this is why this is the
stupid<00:03:22.080> thing<00:03:22.200> I<00:03:22.320> did<00:03:22.470> the<00:03:22.590> very<00:03:22.709> first<00:03:22.860> time

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
stupid thing I did the very first time

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.729 
stupid thing I did the very first time
because<00:03:23.790> you're<00:03:24.000> strapped<00:03:24.390> in<00:03:24.600> and<00:03:25.350> you're

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
because you're strapped in and you're

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.470 
because you're strapped in and you're
strapped<00:03:26.040> in<00:03:26.190> on<00:03:26.370> the<00:03:26.520> board<00:03:26.730> if<00:03:27.120> you<00:03:27.239> lift

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
strapped in on the board if you lift

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.990 
strapped in on the board if you lift
both<00:03:27.660> feet<00:03:28.020> off<00:03:28.050> the<00:03:28.410> board<00:03:28.620> the<00:03:29.459> board<00:03:29.700> comes

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
both feet off the board the board comes

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.420 
both feet off the board the board comes
up<00:03:30.209> so<00:03:30.959> that's<00:03:31.650> something<00:03:31.860> to<00:03:32.010> keep<00:03:32.220> in<00:03:32.400> mind

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
up so that's something to keep in mind

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.280 
up so that's something to keep in mind
you<00:03:33.030> can<00:03:33.060> catch<00:03:33.660> a<00:03:33.810> toe

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
you can catch a toe

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.620 
you can catch a toe
if<00:03:34.350> you<00:03:35.160> accidentally<00:03:35.790> take<00:03:36.000> both<00:03:36.270> feet<00:03:36.510> off

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
if you accidentally take both feet off

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.540 
if you accidentally take both feet off
the<00:03:36.810> board<00:03:37.050> and<00:03:37.320> pull<00:03:37.530> it<00:03:37.680> over<00:03:37.770> your<00:03:38.070> feet<00:03:38.280> so

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
the board and pull it over your feet so

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.840 
the board and pull it over your feet so
you<00:03:39.150> want<00:03:39.300> to<00:03:39.390> be<00:03:40.040> centered<00:03:41.040> as<00:03:41.280> much<00:03:41.550> as<00:03:41.730> you

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
you want to be centered as much as you

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.520 
you want to be centered as much as you
can<00:03:42.030> on<00:03:42.209> the<00:03:42.239> board<00:03:42.510> and<00:03:42.690> then<00:03:43.200> I've<00:03:43.380> been

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
can on the board and then I've been

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.949 
can on the board and then I've been
running<00:03:43.920> in<00:03:44.040> place<00:03:44.190> so<00:03:45.030> you<00:03:45.120> can<00:03:45.270> actually<00:03:45.510> run

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
running in place so you can actually run

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.449 
running in place so you can actually run
and<00:03:46.290> you're<00:03:46.380> getting<00:03:46.530> resistance<00:03:46.860> from<00:03:47.280> both

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
and you're getting resistance from both

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.370 
and you're getting resistance from both
your<00:03:47.640> upper<00:03:47.910> and<00:03:48.090> lower<00:03:48.180> body<00:03:48.540> as<00:03:48.870> you<00:03:49.110> do<00:03:49.230> the

your upper and lower body as you do the

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.650 
your upper and lower body as you do the
exercise<00:03:49.860> one<00:03:50.850> of<00:03:50.970> the<00:03:51.030> other<00:03:51.209> things<00:03:51.480> I've

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
exercise one of the other things I've

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.580 
exercise one of the other things I've
really<00:03:51.930> enjoyed<00:03:52.200> doing<00:03:52.410> is<00:03:54.050> boxing<00:03:55.050> movements

so really it's got a lot to offer I just
personally<00:05:26.490> wouldn't<00:05:27.390> use<00:05:27.660> it<00:05:27.840> as<00:05:27.990> my<00:05:28.230> sole

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:32.910 
source of exercise you know I think it

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.470 
source of exercise you know I think it
can<00:05:33.060> complement<00:05:33.810> a<00:05:34.050> home<00:05:34.890> gym<00:05:35.220> in<00:05:35.640> a<00:05:36.270> lot<00:05:36.450> of

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:36.480 
can complement a home gym in a lot of

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.530 
can complement a home gym in a lot of
ways<00:05:36.720> so<00:05:37.200> that's<00:05:38.190> my<00:05:38.400> review<00:05:38.550> I<00:05:38.760> think<00:05:39.120> it<00:05:39.300> is<00:05:39.510> a

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:39.540 
ways so that's my review I think it is a

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.120 
ways so that's my review I think it is a
good<00:05:39.780> piece<00:05:39.930> of<00:05:39.990> equipment<00:05:40.200> I<00:05:40.560> think<00:05:40.800> it<00:05:40.890> does

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.130 
good piece of equipment I think it does

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.100 
good piece of equipment I think it does
deliver<00:05:41.370> what<00:05:41.760> they<00:05:41.880> say<00:05:42.060> they<00:05:42.270> that<00:05:42.810> it<00:05:42.960> will

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110 
deliver what they say they that it will

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.710 
deliver what they say they that it will
deliver<00:05:44.000> especially<00:05:45.000> if<00:05:45.090> you<00:05:45.180> go<00:05:45.270> up<00:05:45.390> to<00:05:45.420> the

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:45.720 
deliver especially if you go up to the

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.590 
deliver especially if you go up to the
higher<00:05:45.900> resistance<00:05:46.440> bands<00:05:46.860> but<00:05:47.550> I<00:05:47.940> think<00:05:48.420> it's

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:48.600 
higher resistance bands but I think it's

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.170 
higher resistance bands but I think it's
best<00:05:49.020> used<00:05:49.440> in<00:05:49.620> conjunction<00:05:50.220> with<00:05:50.850> some<00:05:51.000> other
