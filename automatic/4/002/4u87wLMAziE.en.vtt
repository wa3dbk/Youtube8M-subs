"If my life..."

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.960

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:59.400
"Why is today my life
in a mess?"

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.880
"I've seen..."

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.600
"many a Taj Mahal break"

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.040
"I never imagined..."

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.800
"the breeze would kick up a storm"

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.240
"I never imagined..."

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.400
"her tresses would turn
into serpents"

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:33.600
"Your face doesn't give me
warmth anymore"

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:40.600
"There's no sign of fidelity
in your eyes either"

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.600
"Should someone ask me..."

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.200

"I'd say, you are one..."

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.600
"who betrayed me,
ruined me in love"

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:26.920
"The song of love that
was never ever composed..."

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.600
"you are that affliction"

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:38.200
"What sweetly cheats the eyes..."

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.280
"you are that beautiful,
false intoxication"

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:48.960
"Ask your heart at least..."

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.000
"who you belong to. Me?"

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.800
"Or, are you another's beloved?"

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:09.000
"Should someone ask me..."

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.080
"what you mean to me..."

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:16.320

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.000
"who betrayed me,
ruined me in love"

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.840
"You are infidel"

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.080
"You are unfaithful"
