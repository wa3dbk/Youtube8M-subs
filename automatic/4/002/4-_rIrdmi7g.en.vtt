00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:07.690 

right<00:00:06.819> so<00:00:07.210> just

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:07.700 
right so just

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.039 
right so just
you<00:00:07.780> took<00:00:08.780> a<00:00:08.840> bit<00:00:09.080> more<00:00:09.349> about<00:00:09.590> break<00:00:10.160> lines

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:11.049 
you took a bit more about break lines

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:13.740 
you took a bit more about break lines
here<00:00:12.049> these<00:00:12.889> are<00:00:13.100> some<00:00:13.250> draw

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:13.750 
here these are some draw

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:19.800 
here these are some draw
I<00:00:13.780> did<00:00:14.110> a<00:00:14.560> few<00:00:15.550> years<00:00:15.640> ago<00:00:17.760> here<00:00:18.760> we<00:00:18.940> have<00:00:19.210> an

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:19.810 
I did a few years ago here we have an

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:28.589 
I did a few years ago here we have an
ordinary<00:00:20.140> two<00:00:21.010> units<00:00:25.020> square<00:00:26.020> knot<00:00:26.259> which<00:00:27.599> you

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:28.599 
ordinary two units square knot which you

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:32.430 
ordinary two units square knot which you
can<00:00:28.840> be<00:00:29.020> used<00:00:29.230> as<00:00:29.410> a<00:00:29.439> as<00:00:29.740> a<00:00:29.949> borderline<00:00:30.609> in<00:00:31.600> the

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:32.440 
can be used as a as a borderline in the

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:38.790 
can be used as a as a borderline in the
second<00:00:33.040> one<00:00:33.750> I've<00:00:34.750> put<00:00:35.140> a<00:00:35.170> brake<00:00:35.530> line<00:00:36.480> in<00:00:37.800> so

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800 
second one I've put a brake line in so

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.259 
second one I've put a brake line in so
there<00:00:39.220> is<00:00:39.340> a<00:00:39.370> brake<00:00:39.730> line<00:00:40.059> in<00:00:40.420> here<00:00:41.230> in<00:00:42.030> here<00:00:43.030> in

00:00:43.259 --> 00:00:43.269 
there is a brake line in here in here in

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:46.549 
there is a brake line in here in here in
here<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:44.710> in<00:00:45.340> here

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
here and in here

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.619 
here and in here
etc<00:00:47.559> so<00:00:50.100> this<00:00:51.100> is<00:00:51.280> changing<00:00:51.820> the<00:00:51.940> pattern

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629 
etc so this is changing the pattern

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:54.990 
etc so this is changing the pattern
quite<00:00:52.930> considerably<00:00:53.649> so<00:00:53.950> you<00:00:54.010> have<00:00:54.340> the<00:00:54.610> these

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
quite considerably so you have the these

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.190 
quite considerably so you have the these
sort<00:00:55.360> of<00:00:55.739> rings<00:00:56.760> going<00:00:57.760> through<00:00:58.090> it<00:00:58.239> on<00:00:58.450> the

00:00:59.190 --> 00:00:59.200 
sort of rings going through it on the

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.840 
sort of rings going through it on the
next<00:00:59.500> one<00:00:59.710> down<00:01:01.860> I've<00:01:02.860> put<00:01:03.250> the<00:01:03.340> brake<00:01:03.579> lines

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
next one down I've put the brake lines

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.310 
next one down I've put the brake lines
in<00:01:04.089> horizontally<00:01:04.930> one<00:01:05.520> miss<00:01:06.520> one<00:01:06.820> one<00:01:07.630> miss

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
in horizontally one miss one one miss

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:15.180 
in horizontally one miss one one miss
one<00:01:08.649> one<00:01:09.430> miss<00:01:10.060> one<00:01:10.360> one<00:01:11.170> miss<00:01:11.770> one<00:01:12.270> etc<00:01:14.190> which

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
one one miss one one miss one etc which

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.649 
one one miss one one miss one etc which
gives<00:01:15.430> quite<00:01:15.729> a<00:01:15.789> different<00:01:16.330> effect<00:01:18.420> here<00:01:19.420> I've

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
gives quite a different effect here I've

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:22.469 
gives quite a different effect here I've
linked<00:01:20.170> these<00:01:20.619> two<00:01:21.070> together<00:01:21.430> so<00:01:21.939> we<00:01:22.240> have<00:01:22.450> a

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
linked these two together so we have a

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:25.740 
linked these two together so we have a
vertical<00:01:22.840> brake<00:01:23.560> line<00:01:23.799> like<00:01:24.100> that<00:01:24.750> followed

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
vertical brake line like that followed

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.289 
vertical brake line like that followed
by<00:01:25.960> a<00:01:25.990> horizontal<00:01:26.770> one<00:01:27.150> vertical<00:01:28.150> one

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:28.299 
by a horizontal one vertical one

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:29.700 
by a horizontal one vertical one
horizontal<00:01:28.330> and<00:01:29.049> vertical<00:01:29.530> one<00:01:29.680> horizontal

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
horizontal and vertical one horizontal

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.859 
horizontal and vertical one horizontal
one<00:01:30.610> and<00:01:30.869> then<00:01:32.070> finally<00:01:33.180> at<00:01:34.180> the<00:01:34.240> bottom<00:01:34.720> of

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
one and then finally at the bottom of

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:40.469 
one and then finally at the bottom of
this<00:01:35.080> one<00:01:35.409> we<00:01:36.040> have<00:01:38.610> horizontal<00:01:39.610> one<00:01:40.180> at<00:01:40.330> the

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
this one we have horizontal one at the

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:42.179 
this one we have horizontal one at the
top<00:01:40.780> horizontal<00:01:41.080> one<00:01:41.799> at<00:01:41.890> the<00:01:41.979> bottom

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:42.189 
top horizontal one at the bottom

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:44.940 
top horizontal one at the bottom
horizontal<00:01:42.640> at<00:01:43.630> the<00:01:43.720> top<00:01:44.020> horizontal<00:01:44.380> at<00:01:44.860> the

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
horizontal at the top horizontal at the

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.410 
horizontal at the top horizontal at the
bottom<00:01:45.310> so<00:01:45.790> you<00:01:45.880> can<00:01:46.000> see<00:01:46.180> those<00:01:46.390> patterns<00:01:48.420> are

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
bottom so you can see those patterns are

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.280 
bottom so you can see those patterns are
very<00:01:50.189> quite<00:01:51.189> a<00:01:51.220> lot<00:01:51.579> simply<00:01:52.270> by<00:01:52.509> the<00:01:52.570> way<00:01:52.990> the

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
very quite a lot simply by the way the

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.530 
very quite a lot simply by the way the
brake<00:01:53.619> lines<00:01:53.979> are<00:01:54.430> placed<00:01:54.939> on<00:01:55.509> the<00:01:56.500> grid<00:01:57.540> now

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
brake lines are placed on the grid now

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.740 
brake lines are placed on the grid now
you<00:01:59.110> will<00:01:59.259> remember<00:01:59.470> I<00:02:00.280> just<00:02:00.700> put<00:02:01.090> this<00:02:01.299> next

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
you will remember I just put this next

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:11.160 
you will remember I just put this next
one<00:02:01.930> up<00:02:03.180> that<00:02:04.180> I<00:02:08.519> showed<00:02:09.519> you<00:02:09.850> the<00:02:10.119> three<00:02:11.019> by

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
one up that I showed you the three by

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.710 
one up that I showed you the three by
three<00:02:11.440> unit<00:02:11.829> knot<00:02:12.040> which<00:02:12.250> I'm<00:02:12.670> very<00:02:13.239> fond<00:02:13.510> of

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
three unit knot which I'm very fond of

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.660 
three unit knot which I'm very fond of
just<00:02:14.019> an<00:02:14.170> ordinary<00:02:14.410> three<00:02:14.829> by<00:02:15.010> three<00:02:15.280> Union

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
just an ordinary three by three Union

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.340 
just an ordinary three by three Union
not<00:02:15.850> I've<00:02:16.410> emphasized<00:02:17.410> here<00:02:17.860> the<00:02:18.280> edge<00:02:18.840> of<00:02:19.840> it

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
not I've emphasized here the edge of it

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.660 
not I've emphasized here the edge of it
which<00:02:20.620> helps<00:02:20.829> to<00:02:21.070> fill<00:02:21.370> the<00:02:21.700> overrun

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
which helps to fill the overrun

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.150 
which helps to fill the overrun
I've<00:02:23.030> done<00:02:23.209> a<00:02:23.420> lot<00:02:23.750> of<00:02:23.900> shading<00:02:24.140> on<00:02:24.500> it<00:02:24.680> to<00:02:24.920> help

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
I've done a lot of shading on it to help

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.229 
I've done a lot of shading on it to help
her<00:02:25.370> that<00:02:25.790> is<00:02:25.970> the<00:02:26.360> plain<00:02:26.630> and<00:02:26.989> simple<00:02:28.239> 3x3

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239

unit not and these underneath it six

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.910 
unit not and these underneath it six
underneath<00:02:34.130> there<00:02:34.430> are<00:02:35.590> experimenting<00:02:36.590> with

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
underneath there are experimenting with

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:43.270 
underneath there are experimenting with
the<00:02:38.620> addition<00:02:39.620> of<00:02:39.650> brake<00:02:40.370> line<00:02:40.700> so<00:02:41.060> on<00:02:41.300> the<00:02:42.280> 3x3

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
the addition of brake line so on the 3x3

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.890 
the addition of brake line so on the 3x3
unit<00:02:44.000> grid<00:02:44.270> on<00:02:44.480> this<00:02:45.020> one<00:02:45.970> one<00:02:46.970> there<00:02:47.300> one

there one there one there in this one

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.970 
there one there one there in this one
there's<00:02:51.980> an<00:02:52.280> l-shape<00:02:53.269> going<00:02:54.230> in<00:02:54.470> there<00:02:54.769> and

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
there's an l-shape going in there and

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.140 
there's an l-shape going in there and
the<00:02:55.790> same<00:02:56.000> on<00:02:56.239> the<00:02:56.360> other<00:02:56.420> side<00:02:57.040> in<00:02:58.040> here<00:02:58.880> it's

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
the same on the other side in here it's

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:06.250 
the same on the other side in here it's
just<00:02:59.300> one<00:03:00.670> two<00:03:01.670> three<00:03:02.630> four<00:03:03.610> in<00:03:04.610> here<00:03:05.000> I<00:03:05.720> guess

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
just one two three four in here I guess

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.830 
just one two three four in here I guess
it's<00:03:06.440> another<00:03:06.970> that's<00:03:07.970> the<00:03:08.120> same<00:03:08.330> as<00:03:08.480> that<00:03:08.630> and

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
it's another that's the same as that and

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.360 
it's another that's the same as that and
the<00:03:09.200> other<00:03:09.440> way<00:03:09.530> around<00:03:10.450> anyway<00:03:11.450> so<00:03:12.350> and<00:03:13.190> in

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
the other way around anyway so and in

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.370 
the other way around anyway so and in
here<00:03:13.640> it's<00:03:13.760> simply<00:03:16.180> one<00:03:17.180> in<00:03:17.450> the<00:03:17.720> middle<00:03:18.110> very

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
here it's simply one in the middle very

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.660 
here it's simply one in the middle very
similar<00:03:18.799> to<00:03:18.950> the<00:03:19.069> 4x4<00:03:20.260> that<00:03:21.260> I<00:03:21.640> showed<00:03:22.640> you

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
similar to the 4x4 that I showed you

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:28.599 
similar to the 4x4 that I showed you
before<00:03:25.060> this<00:03:26.060> one<00:03:26.390> mmm<00:03:27.170> two<00:03:27.560> short<00:03:28.100> ones<00:03:28.370> in

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:28.609 
before this one mmm two short ones in

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:34.690 
before this one mmm two short ones in
the<00:03:28.700> middle<00:03:29.230> that's<00:03:30.230> another

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:43.120 

another<00:03:35.420> one<00:03:35.660> here<00:03:36.140> which<00:03:36.380> I<00:03:37.069> did<00:03:41.470> in<00:03:42.470> this<00:03:42.800> one

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
another one here which I did in this one

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:48.130 
another one here which I did in this one
of<00:03:45.100> obviously<00:03:46.100> this<00:03:46.220> is<00:03:46.400> the<00:03:46.580> same<00:03:47.110> 3x3<00:03:48.110> grid

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
of obviously this is the same 3x3 grid

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.030 
of obviously this is the same 3x3 grid
just<00:03:48.590> twisted<00:03:49.220> round<00:03:49.400> I<00:03:50.440> put<00:03:51.440> four<00:03:51.709> break

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
just twisted round I put four break

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.270 
just twisted round I put four break
lines<00:03:52.370> in<00:03:52.640> the<00:03:52.820> middle<00:03:53.450> of<00:03:53.660> that<00:03:54.110> 3x3<00:03:54.860> grid<00:03:54.890> to

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
lines in the middle of that 3x3 grid to

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.110 
lines in the middle of that 3x3 grid to
take<00:03:55.520> out<00:03:55.760> the<00:03:55.940> center<00:03:56.180> and<00:03:57.670> so<00:03:58.670> essentially

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
take out the center and so essentially

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.970 
take out the center and so essentially
I've<00:03:59.330> got<00:03:59.540> a<00:03:59.570> border<00:03:59.870> pattern<00:04:00.230> really<00:04:00.620> in<00:04:00.830> a

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
I've got a border pattern really in a

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.840 
I've got a border pattern really in a
3x3<00:04:02.440> unit<00:04:03.440> and<00:04:03.590> that<00:04:03.950> I<00:04:03.980> put<00:04:04.310> that<00:04:04.489> in<00:04:04.640> as<00:04:04.819> a

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
3x3 unit and that I put that in as a

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:11.040 
3x3 unit and that I put that in as a
decorative<00:04:05.450> device<00:04:06.110> on<00:04:07.239> the<00:04:08.890> bottom<00:04:09.890> ones

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
decorative device on the bottom ones

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:16.960 
decorative device on the bottom ones
this<00:04:12.050> one<00:04:12.700> has<00:04:13.700> got<00:04:14.440> two<00:04:15.440> just<00:04:16.160> two<00:04:16.430> short<00:04:16.790> ones

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
this one has got two just two short ones

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.110 
this one has got two just two short ones
coming<00:04:17.359> in<00:04:17.450> from<00:04:17.660> the<00:04:17.780> sides<00:04:18.519> here<00:04:19.519> we've<00:04:19.850> got

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
coming in from the sides here we've got

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.510 
coming in from the sides here we've got
crossed<00:04:20.510> break<00:04:20.930> lines<00:04:21.230> in<00:04:21.470> the<00:04:21.560> middle<00:04:21.919> which

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
crossed break lines in the middle which

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.159 
crossed break lines in the middle which
gives<00:04:22.550> this<00:04:23.030> interesting<00:04:23.840> sort<00:04:24.080> of

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:24.169 
gives this interesting sort of

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:29.530 
gives this interesting sort of
chain-link<00:04:25.720> effect<00:04:26.720> and<00:04:27.640> here<00:04:28.640> we've<00:04:28.970> got<00:04:29.210> to

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
chain-link effect and here we've got to

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.230 
chain-link effect and here we've got to
sort<00:04:30.200> of<00:04:30.320> long<00:04:30.710> ones<00:04:30.980> coming<00:04:31.400> in<00:04:31.580> from<00:04:32.060> the

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
sort of long ones coming in from the

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.230 
sort of long ones coming in from the
sides<00:04:32.480> there<00:04:32.900> so<00:04:33.740> this<00:04:34.520> just<00:04:34.790> gives<00:04:35.030> an

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
sides there so this just gives an

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.200 
sides there so this just gives an
example<00:04:35.360> without<00:04:36.080> me<00:04:36.530> having<00:04:36.710> to<00:04:37.030> draw<00:04:38.030> them

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
example without me having to draw them

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.310 
example without me having to draw them
all<00:04:38.390> out<00:04:38.630> for<00:04:38.960> you<00:04:39.190> of<00:04:40.390> what<00:04:41.390> is<00:04:41.540> possible<00:04:42.080> with

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
all out for you of what is possible with

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.830 
all out for you of what is possible with
with<00:04:42.800> break<00:04:43.070> lines<00:04:43.400> so<00:04:43.729> the<00:04:44.150> thing<00:04:44.390> to<00:04:44.510> do<00:04:44.690> is

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
with break lines so the thing to do is

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.630 
with break lines so the thing to do is
to<00:04:45.020> experiment<00:04:45.740> you<00:04:45.919> can<00:04:45.979> get<00:04:46.160> quite<00:04:46.370> a<00:04:46.430> lot

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:46.640 
to experiment you can get quite a lot

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.270 
to experiment you can get quite a lot
just<00:04:46.820> out<00:04:47.030> of<00:04:47.150> a<00:04:47.210> 3x3<00:04:47.510> unit<00:04:48.410> go<00:04:48.950> ahead<00:04:48.979> so

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
just out of a 3x3 unit go ahead so

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.050 
just out of a 3x3 unit go ahead so
anything<00:04:50.530> bigger<00:04:51.530> than<00:04:51.680> that<00:04:51.860> you<00:04:52.250> can<00:04:52.490> the

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
anything bigger than that you can the

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.950 
anything bigger than that you can the
sky's<00:04:53.360> the<00:04:53.390> limit

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
sky's the limit

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:59.950 
sky's the limit
so<00:04:54.919> that<00:04:55.580> is<00:04:56.650> break<00:04:57.650> lines
