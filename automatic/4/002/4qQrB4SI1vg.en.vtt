00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:14.070
 it is titled 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.280
 I have and thanks 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.980
 it's an inspiration it's a totally boric climate because 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.540
 for that reason I think that being with all that experience of what we carry 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:25.199
 inside that town 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.019
 customers who are the ones who always yearn to have better days 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.270
 just the song speaks of all that gratitude we have with our creator 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.190
 because we talk about the landscape we talk about people 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.210
 because every day of so many things that we have to thank the Lord 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.320
 and all that is reflected in this song and we invite you to listen 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.070
 I thank you, sir 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.200

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.820
 owns since very child 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.080
 great ricky groups that I always carry in my heart as much as 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.070
 carcas for almost 14 15 years of having been sharing with them 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.810
 with your country with manuel luque that really another cute experience 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.410
 we made pasha 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:19.700
 and I think they are 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.150
 group c that really have penetrated very deep in what is Andean music the 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.950
 music 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.780
 Bolivian folkloric 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.470
 and good percent 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.730
 when one day I delivered 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.310
 all that my talent the feet of christ starts a new life 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.140
 a new horizon began 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.890
 because there I also had to start to feel what music is the creation 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.010
 also that of god 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.789
 that through the holy spirit 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:50.319
 I could already understand many things in order to have new inspirations 

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:51.120
 messages 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.640
 that they were just from Ansa Buenaventura 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.359
 there are songs that speak 

00:01:55.359 --> 00:02:00.099
 of the reflection of having the inner peace that many of us long for so many 

00:02:00.099 --> 00:02:04.760
 we want percent that loneliness sometimes in the world 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.730
 just all these songs 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.159
 a soda for the soul 

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:13.499
 it's that fresh water that we sometimes have in our desert 

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:16.499
 and just all that can excite 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:28.839
 considered that everything we had 

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:33.650

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:36.189

 the secular because it has only been like a way like god 

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:46.039

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:51.399
 inside the wall he had to dispose through his grace to call me 

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:53.199

00:02:58.179 --> 00:02:59.089
 every day 

00:02:59.089 --> 00:03:03.409
 the only thing that I do injustice I know what my work is there is a lot of difference between 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:06.599
 when the weather was a circular singer because it had to be 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:10.329
 preparing myself all the time for the external part what was what I was going to 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:14.629

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:20.669

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:25.599
 to be used by him that every day we want a better instrument in 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:28.599
 Amman 11 

00:03:34.679 --> 00:03:38.649
