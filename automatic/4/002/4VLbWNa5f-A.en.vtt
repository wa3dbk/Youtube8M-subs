to<00:01:36.960> just<00:01:37.620> turn<00:01:37.830> as<00:01:38.100> tightly<00:01:38.430> as<00:01:38.670> i<00:01:38.820> possibly

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
to just turn as tightly as i possibly

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.380 
to just turn as tightly as i possibly
can<00:01:39.300> to<00:01:39.690> get<00:01:39.780> back<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.229> runway<00:01:40.670> I'm<00:01:41.670> not<00:01:42.330> a
