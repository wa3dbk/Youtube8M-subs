00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
toe on the tip just so I can get as much

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.320 
toe on the tip just so I can get as much
pop<00:01:11.220> as<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:11.580> can<00:01:11.850> on<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.090> ground<00:01:12.260> my<00:01:13.260> front<00:01:13.650> foot

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
pop as I can on the ground my front foot

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.420 
pop as I can on the ground my front foot
is<00:01:15.330> most<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:15.960> my<00:01:16.110> front<00:01:16.470> foot<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:16.830> on<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.189> board

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
is most of my front foot is on the board

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.280 
is most of my front foot is on the board
with<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.700> bit<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:18.060> my<00:01:18.210> toe<00:01:18.479> hanging<00:01:18.750> off<00:01:19.049> like

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
with a bit of my toe hanging off like

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.469 
with a bit of my toe hanging off like
this<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:20.130> reason<00:01:20.430> for<00:01:20.460> this<00:01:20.759> is<00:01:20.970> so<00:01:21.450> that

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
this and the reason for this is so that

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.960 
this and the reason for this is so that
when<00:01:21.720> you<00:01:21.840> pop<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.110> board<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:23.100> can<00:01:23.250> drag<00:01:23.610> your

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
when you pop the board you can drag your

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.210 
when you pop the board you can drag your
foot<00:01:24.509> up<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.960> board<00:01:24.990> and<00:01:25.470> your<00:01:25.560> heel<00:01:25.860> is<00:01:26.100> the

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
foot up the board and your heel is the

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.340 
foot up the board and your heel is the
last<00:01:26.520> thing<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.000> come<00:01:27.150> off<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.960> tip<00:01:28.140> of<00:01:28.170> the

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
last thing to come off the tip of the

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.069 
last thing to come off the tip of the
nose<00:01:28.530> out<00:01:28.920> pass<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.490> note<00:01:29.700> out<00:01:29.970> pass<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.869> nose

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
nose out pass the note out pass the nose

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.530 
nose out pass the note out pass the nose
in<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.350> front<00:01:31.650> of<00:01:31.740> your<00:01:31.829> board<00:01:32.070> now<00:01:32.909> it's

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
in the front of your board now it's

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.870 
in the front of your board now it's
going<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:33.780> depend<00:01:33.930> on<00:01:34.380> yourself<00:01:35.189> as<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.640> where

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
going to depend on yourself as to where

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.480 
going to depend on yourself as to where
you're<00:01:36.060> gonna<00:01:36.119> set<00:01:36.570> up<00:01:36.750> on<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.979> height<00:01:38.159> of<00:01:38.400> the

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
you're gonna set up on the height of the

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.640 
you're gonna set up on the height of the
board<00:01:38.759> I<00:01:38.970> usually<00:01:39.780> set<00:01:40.020> up<00:01:40.170> just<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.619> little

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
board I usually set up just a little

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.219 
board I usually set up just a little
behind<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.369> bolts<00:01:41.579> maybe<00:01:42.450> give<00:01:42.659> myself<00:01:42.869> an

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
behind the bolts maybe give myself an

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.020 
behind the bolts maybe give myself an
inch<00:01:43.500> behind<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.979> front<00:01:44.250> bolt<00:01:44.490> one<00:01:44.700> thing<00:01:44.909> I

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030

try to imagine when I'm doing a heel
flip<00:01:46.710> is<00:01:46.950> I<00:01:47.430> try<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.700> imagine<00:01:48.360> myself<00:01:48.869> doing

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
flip is I try to imagine myself doing

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.440 
flip is I try to imagine myself doing
almost<00:01:49.680> like<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:49.860> kung<00:01:50.220> fu<00:01:50.250> type<00:01:50.790> of<00:01:50.970> kick<00:01:51.270> out

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
almost like a kung fu type of kick out

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.139 
almost like a kung fu type of kick out
past<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:52.020> nose<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.619> what<00:01:53.579> this<00:01:53.729> does<00:01:53.970> is

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
past the nose and what this does is

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.660 
past the nose and what this does is
gives<00:01:54.360> you<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:55.439> spread<00:01:55.890> so<00:01:56.369> that<00:01:56.520> the

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
gives you the the spread so that the

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.179 
gives you the the spread so that the
board<00:01:56.909> can<00:01:57.119> flip<00:01:57.390> underneath<00:01:57.869> so<00:01:58.530> imagine<00:01:59.040> you

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
board can flip underneath so imagine you

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.420
