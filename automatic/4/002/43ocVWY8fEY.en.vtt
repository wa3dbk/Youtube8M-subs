00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.560
 [Music] 

00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:06.450
 hello my loves all right with you in 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.370
 video of today will teach us how to 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.920
 leaves our lines great using 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.559
 wheat flour the ones we have 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.440
 at home so come on we'll need 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.260
 wheat flour of course let's use 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:26.670
 also superbond coast or glue to the 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:31.740
 nepotism the scissors scissors durex the people 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:34.140
 make the glue drying oil and base a 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.960
 School glue may be stick or 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.590
 liquid or even use a base and a 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.390
 piece of book cover or card stock is 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.100
 aluminum paper 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.649
 so come on because I'm doing 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.809
 with aluminum foil than with the 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.420
 because in the video of the salt nail a lot 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:54.510
 people asked me if I could do 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.820
 milk carton or sun aluminum foil 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.680
 It just does not work with the milk carton. 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.840
 cause we want too thick was box 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.949
 under the notion rio with aluminum foil 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.659
 only he alone does not give is he not 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.189
 solve the problem because as he 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.780
 will make it will tear 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.340
 so that's why I did it that way 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.830
 to show you and that is yes 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.990
 It is also possible to make the nail of salt 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:21.360
 wheat flour with the materials that the 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:23.280
 people have indoors then it's that 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.680
 same ischemia that you have already seen 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.920
 other lines in the previous but I 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.360
 I keep coming in on our bad and 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.520
 We'll do that later. 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.390
 spin down will fit just right 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.390
 right there on the nail 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.670
 Then you leave, cutting very slowly. 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.360
 Just a little bit to see it fits 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:52.840
 right on the nail and now with durex it's just 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:02:03.810
 go there at the top and do not escape 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:02:03.810
 [Music] 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:11.260
 now it just comes with the treasury 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:13.209
 find a little piece of the flip flop 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.160
 to help when we vote 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.130
 dipping it into the 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.019
 Wheat is with aris we will start 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.940
 end the oiliness you have in 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:24.100
 top of our line just even a 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.420
 little harm the nail is not only have 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.420
 eyes to day very fast 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:36.670
 now I only saw with drying oil pass in the 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:40.299
 our support all around him without 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.709
 pass on our street coming with the glue 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:43.359
 Now we'll do the same. 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:51.549
 scheme to pass a little of our 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:54.700
 nail and comes filling the rest dive 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:58.150
 in wheat flour until you see how many 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.170
 layers was needed for me. 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.380
 the first 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.150
 I'm going to pass the second layer of glue and 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:11.859
 I'm going to dive into wheat flour too. 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:14.920
 again the wheat flour is in 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:18.640
 Compared to the salt I found that more 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.920
 Finite gives a more even look 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:24.130
 with our normal lines but not that 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.989
 the salt lines is either more difficult or 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.880
 to be bad, not vice versa 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:31.060
 both look great the result of them 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:33.310
 Similar raps are perfect but I 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.579
 I liked the wheat spain better because 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:39.700
 It gets easier for us to remove 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:41.470
 is also the comparison between the two 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.440
 have another video here in the parana being 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:47.760
 make the salt meal and also teach the 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.760
 to do with the pet bottle 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:57.250
 now to finish your people apply the 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:04:00.099
 last layer of glue expect to dry for 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.079
 remove is simple just grab the scissors and 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:04.750
 cut the durex or tape that the 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:06.640
 people put up and standing out from magellan 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:17.799
 Yes, and very carefully, we do not 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:19.750
 break our moon for you to see 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.000
 are born to do with this scheme is 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:25.389
 How do I have it for you? I'll show you how. 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.300
 which strip now looks only on foil 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:30.370
 and the cover of the real notebook did not 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.530
 no change is not right yet 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.699
 Finished now, now comes the part. 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.400
 more chatinha 

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:37.750
 but f gives a better effect had part of 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.000
 Luck, we'll have it later. 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.190
 I had enough and but when I said that 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.750
 is the difference between the nail and the salt 

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.610
 a flour of rigor that it seemed that people 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.470
 can give a better pull 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:50.789
 faster than in the saulo 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.789
 but it is the same result 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:05:01.750
 [Music] 

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:04.330
 now water beak thorn to take away 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.340
 all opposition and in sequence I will see 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.410
 with my super bonder glue again 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.360
 and spend a little bit here in the 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.310
 low so as not to run the risk of when 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.640
 You're doing the dishes doing her bathing. 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:17.410
 has been crumbling the break and should not 

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.480
 here in the channel will have the video of 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:21.820
 How will I teach you to shoot her? 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:24.130
 both the nail of salt and flour 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:26.770
 of wheat or the bottle claw asks 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:29.110
 many of you ask me to teach me 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:31.360
 and then I'll record the video wait only 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.880
 the time it left my nail and I'm coming 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.670
 record a video for you is or until 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:41.560
 even if you have already climbed on the channel before 

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:45.930
 the video subscribes to the click 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.930
 I liked until the next video bye
