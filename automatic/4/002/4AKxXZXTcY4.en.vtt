00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
going to put a little bit into the

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:42.039

airbrush and put my mask on and check my
pressure<00:03:42.610> check<00:03:43.610> my<00:03:44.170> nozzle<00:03:45.579> now<00:03:46.579> basically

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
pressure check my nozzle now basically

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:50.199 
pressure check my nozzle now basically
when<00:03:47.420> you<00:03:47.510> apply<00:03:47.900> this<00:03:47.959> you<00:03:48.200> have<00:03:48.530> to<00:03:48.739> use<00:03:49.209> a

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
when you apply this you have to use a

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:53.470 
when you apply this you have to use a
brushing<00:03:51.019> stroke<00:03:51.440> you<00:03:51.590> can't<00:03:51.829> just<00:03:52.480> spray

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
brushing stroke you can't just spray

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.050 
brushing stroke you can't just spray
like<00:03:53.720> you<00:03:53.870> would<00:03:54.019> normally<00:03:54.380> with<00:03:54.530> spray<00:03:54.890> paint

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:33.240 
this too is when you seal you'll spray

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:35.660 
this too is when you seal you'll spray
and<00:06:33.420> you'll<00:06:33.510> get<00:06:33.630> a<00:06:33.690> light<00:06:34.290> light<00:06:34.920> dust<00:06:35.430> on

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:35.670 
and you'll get a light light dust on

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:37.640 
and you'll get a light light dust on
there<00:06:35.850> which<00:06:36.000> is<00:06:36.150> a<00:06:36.180> great<00:06:36.540> thing<00:06:36.570> I<00:06:37.050> take<00:06:37.620> a
