00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
from an unlimited budget and because

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:00.400 
from an unlimited budget and because
we've<00:04:59.090> got<00:04:59.180> a<00:04:59.210> compilation<00:04:59.570> goal<00:04:59.990> that<00:05:00.200> means

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.280 
skills so I thought getting Pele this
early<00:05:04.520> it<00:05:04.670> would<00:05:04.820> be<00:05:05.000> spoiling<00:05:05.390> your<00:05:05.660> bit<00:05:05.930> so

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.290 
early it would be spoiling your bit so
