00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.670

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.740
 and as always bringing you a new 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.180
 video gentlemen first of all a 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.390
 Apology suddenly listening to a 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.650
 my voice is rare but I am sick 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.900
 and well let's pass what I want them 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.550
 prove good since a few days ago I 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.570
 they started commenting and adding messages 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:32.060
 that there was a possibility of 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.920
 special edition so to speak in 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.380
 some places and well I wanted to be 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.970
 looking if there was a possibility that 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.910
 In some store in Mexico I can get 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:43.640
 this edition in the description I'm going to 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.530
 leave two link where you can see these 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.240
 images that are seeing the information 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:51.300
 and all that but huh 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.400
 one I think is from the USA because good 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.670
 you pay in dollars and in the other more in 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:59.980
 euros so I did not find any 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.440
 where it's going to be sold can be here in 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.269
 here in mexico but I have been 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.760
 saying several people that in gamers 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.770
 in gamers in gamers in gamers 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.960
 that is, there is a possibility that in 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.490
 gamers can come to give this edition 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.320
 is in some people I get to 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.150
 they came and they even told me that 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.520
 they went and they asked and they told them 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.950
 yes but good on your page and everything is not 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.600
 they have no official announcement or anything 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.820
 like that so good levels 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.950
 you already know there is a possible edition 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.810
 special good I think that nothing else is 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.080
 the metal box and the game and many 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:35.560
 they are interested in this so here I leave 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:37.470
 the links of the pages or stores 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.649
 cybernetics with whom to call from 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.690
 Europe and the USA are the only ones 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:46.869
 I found in fact there is even shown 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:49.000
 two as different boxes can be 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:52.600
 appreciate that good in the Europe is 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.910
 as well as that images kind of see and 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.979
 in the other nothing else is like coffee with 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.890
 the logo of gears of war and to see clear 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.479
 I say seeing this bag if I would believe it 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.070
 because they are in a store not a 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.810
 official store and all that even say 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.330
 which give the one to two characters 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.180
 pre-sale women but it is not used 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.910
 they are not saying I will not buy my 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.880
 game in the Spain to watch 20 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.170
 days later and in the USA - then I 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.480
 I think that if I'm going to wait 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.670
 try to go personally to gamers 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.620
 ask and if so, then set aside 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.380
 in my game the other presale that apart 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.300
 it will be lost or we will change the 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.950
 I'll check out what I'm doing but 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.530
 know gentlemen a possible edition 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.330
 I think it's an edition 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.120
 normal with metal box but possible 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.620
 means special edition and that's how it is 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.600
 well because it's not going to bring anything more than 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.190
