English<00:00:10.170> side<00:00:10.380> so<00:00:10.620> I<00:00:10.650> thought<00:00:10.800> this<00:00:11.130> would<00:00:11.190> be

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
English side so I thought this would be

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.490 
English side so I thought this would be
a<00:00:11.519> really<00:00:11.910> really<00:00:12.179> hard<00:00:12.509> game<00:00:12.780> I<00:00:12.990> daddy

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
a really really hard game I daddy

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.589 
a really really hard game I daddy
started<00:00:13.980> off<00:00:14.190> with<00:00:14.370> him<00:00:14.580> doing<00:00:15.089> a<00:00:15.179> pass<00:00:15.389> across

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599

started off with him doing a pass across
there<00:00:16.020> all<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.650> way<00:00:16.800> to<00:00:16.859> his<00:00:17.070> strike<00:00:17.430> i<00:00:17.550> think

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
there all the way to his strike i think

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.880 
there all the way to his strike i think
it's<00:00:17.850> bolding<00:00:18.300> and<00:00:18.449> he<00:00:18.990> makes<00:00:19.260> it<00:00:19.439> one<00:00:19.590> no<00:00:19.770> of

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
it's bolding and he makes it one no of

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.710 
it's bolding and he makes it one no of
the<00:00:20.070> three<00:00:20.310> minutes<00:00:20.580> which<00:00:20.699> is<00:00:20.730> a<00:00:20.850> devastating

very<00:00:24.090> early<00:00:24.210> on<00:00:24.420> a<00:00:24.630> guard<00:00:24.930> intersecting<00:00:25.529> there

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.170 
is scored by barrini who is up top with
Andy<00:02:50.620> Carroll<00:02:50.920> and<00:02:51.040> that<00:02:51.550> just<00:02:51.880> are<00:02:52.150> that

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
Andy Carroll and that just are that

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.880 
Andy Carroll and that just are that
really<00:02:52.780> annoying<00:02:53.050> minute<00:02:53.230> is<00:02:53.320> in<00:02:53.410> the<00:02:53.500> 88th

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
really annoying minute is in the 88th

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.010 
really annoying minute is in the 88th
minute<00:02:54.010> and<00:02:54.400> that<00:02:54.970> made<00:02:55.150> the<00:02:55.330> game<00:02:55.510> of<00:02:55.750> draw

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
minute and that made the game of draw

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.630 
minute and that made the game of draw
which<00:02:56.200> is<00:02:56.350> very<00:02:56.650> unfortunate<00:02:57.010> it<00:02:57.310> doesn't<00:02:57.580> go

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
which is very unfortunate it doesn't go

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.400 
which is very unfortunate it doesn't go
to<00:02:57.700> H<00:02:57.880> time<00:02:58.150> or<00:02:58.360> penalties<00:02:58.810> or<00:02:58.990> anything<00:02:59.380> like

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
to H time or penalties or anything like

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.800 
to H time or penalties or anything like
that<00:02:59.560> because<00:03:00.220> the<00:03:00.700> season<00:03:00.940> games<00:03:01.300> just<00:03:01.600> end

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
that because the season games just end

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.420 
that because the season games just end
as<00:03:01.960> draws<00:03:02.320> if<00:03:02.500> it<00:03:02.620> is<00:03:02.710> a<00:03:02.740> draw<00:03:03.040> so<00:03:03.250> that's

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
as draws if it is a draw so that's

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.460 
as draws if it is a draw so that's
really<00:03:03.910> unfortunate<00:03:04.210> the<00:03:04.810> final<00:03:05.170> score<00:03:05.380> is

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
really unfortunate the final score is

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:06.630 
really unfortunate the final score is
one<00:03:05.650> on<00:03:05.770> that<00:03:05.980> is<00:03:06.040> H<00:03:06.190> at<00:03:06.280> the<00:03:06.340> end<00:03:06.460> of<00:03:06.550> this

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
one on that is H at the end of this

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.550 
one on that is H at the end of this
episode<00:03:06.790> yes<00:03:07.240> it<00:03:07.480> is<00:03:07.690> a<00:03:07.720> very<00:03:08.050> quick<00:03:08.410> episode

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
episode yes it is a very quick episode

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.830 
episode yes it is a very quick episode
but<00:03:09.160> that's<00:03:09.940> just<00:03:10.060> how<00:03:10.210> the<00:03:10.270> games<00:03:10.570> when

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
but that's just how the games when

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.720 
but that's just how the games when
hopefully<00:03:11.530> the<00:03:11.650> next<00:03:11.770> one<00:03:12.010> will<00:03:12.190> be<00:03:12.220> a<00:03:12.400> lot

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
hopefully the next one will be a lot

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:13.860 
hopefully the next one will be a lot
longer<00:03:12.910> for<00:03:13.090> you<00:03:13.270> and<00:03:13.510> if<00:03:13.600> you're<00:03:13.840> wondering

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.080 
longer for you and if you're wondering
