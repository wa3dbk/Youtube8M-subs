00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
up pretty easily and let's we don't need

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.490 
up pretty easily and let's we don't need
to<00:00:50.070> use<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.340> knife<00:00:50.550> but<00:00:51.510> it's<00:00:51.989> great<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.350> have

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
to use the knife but it's great to have

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.600 
to use the knife but it's great to have
just<00:00:53.280> for<00:00:53.489> show<00:00:53.730> so<00:00:54.239> what's<00:00:54.570> up<00:00:55.309> open<00:00:56.309> us<00:00:56.430> up

just for show so what's up open us up
here<00:00:58.190> now<00:00:59.190> this<00:00:59.399> one<00:00:59.699> is<00:00:59.730> a<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.930> reason<00:01:01.109> why

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
here now this one is a the reason why

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.650 
here now this one is a the reason why
avoid<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.829> power-mad<00:01:02.730> stuff<00:01:03.270> is<00:01:03.449> because

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
avoid the power-mad stuff is because

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.010 
avoid the power-mad stuff is because
it's<00:01:03.809> kind<00:01:03.960> of<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.369> dark<00:01:05.369> hose<00:01:05.700> I<00:01:06.030> kind<00:01:06.810> of<00:01:06.930> an

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
it's kind of a dark hose I kind of an

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.050 
it's kind of a dark hose I kind of an
expensive<00:01:07.380> investment<00:01:07.970> this<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.360> 9999<00:01:10.700> or<00:01:11.700> 99

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
expensive investment this is 9999 or 99

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.210 
expensive investment this is 9999 or 99
98<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.630> think<00:01:12.990> so<00:01:13.200> it's<00:01:13.350> just<00:01:13.500> just<00:01:13.830> under<00:01:14.070> 100

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
98 I think so it's just just under 100

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.580 
98 I think so it's just just under 100
bucks<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.390> case<00:01:15.630> i'll<00:01:15.900> be<00:01:15.930> getting<00:01:16.200> two

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
bucks and the case i'll be getting two

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.749 
bucks and the case i'll be getting two
for<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.400> iphone<00:01:17.759> 3g<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:18.509> 3gs<00:01:18.540> is<00:01:19.049> 40<00:01:19.680> bucks<00:01:19.920> so

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
for the iphone 3g and 3gs is 40 bucks so

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.560 
for the iphone 3g and 3gs is 40 bucks so
it<00:01:20.939> gets<00:01:21.330> pretty<00:01:21.540> expensive<00:01:22.610> but<00:01:23.610> if<00:01:23.939> you<00:01:24.390> want

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
it gets pretty expensive but if you want

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.899 
it gets pretty expensive but if you want
that<00:01:24.689> wireless<00:01:25.110> charging<00:01:25.700> this<00:01:26.700> is

there you have a USB there and you have
a<00:03:27.799> login<00:03:28.799> control<00:03:29.340> looks<00:03:29.609> like<00:03:29.819> the

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
a login control looks like the

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.059 
a login control looks like the
brightness<00:03:30.420> commute<00:03:30.720> brightness<00:03:31.350> control<00:03:31.799> I

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:32.069 
brightness commute brightness control I

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.440 
brightness commute brightness control I
guess<00:03:32.459> it<00:03:32.609> beeps<00:03:33.170> when<00:03:34.170> it<00:03:34.319> does<00:03:34.500> that<00:03:34.530> so<00:03:35.450> put

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
guess it beeps when it does that so put

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:42.020 
guess it beeps when it does that so put
that<00:03:36.540> down<00:03:36.750> there<00:03:36.810> and<00:03:39.139> we<00:03:40.139> also<00:03:40.350> have<00:03:41.030> the

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
that down there and we also have the

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.520 
that down there and we also have the
case<00:03:42.269> which<00:03:42.900> goes<00:03:43.109> on<00:03:43.260> 2<00:03:43.350> 3gs<00:03:43.769> or<00:03:44.220> iphone<00:03:44.760> 3g<00:03:45.450> a

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
case which goes on 2 3gs or iphone 3g a

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.830 
case which goes on 2 3gs or iphone 3g a
number<00:03:46.530> one<00:03:46.709> and<00:03:47.030> as<00:03:48.030> you<00:03:48.209> can<00:03:48.359> see<00:03:48.389> here<00:03:48.750> it

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
number one and as you can see here it

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.740 
number one and as you can see here it
has<00:03:48.900> a<00:03:49.049> back<00:03:49.410> so<00:03:50.010> this<00:03:50.190> back<00:03:50.489> is<00:03:50.790> needed<00:03:51.569> to

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
has a back so this back is needed to

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.470 
has a back so this back is needed to

this<00:04:27.590> down<00:04:27.830> here<00:04:28.810> see<00:04:29.810> how<00:04:29.900> this<00:04:30.050> case<00:04:30.350> works

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
this down here see how this case works

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.490 
this down here see how this case works
because<00:04:31.070> I<00:04:31.190> wasn't<00:04:31.430> happy<00:04:32.030> with<00:04:32.930> what<00:04:33.140> I<00:04:33.170> saw

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
because I wasn't happy with what I saw

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.440 
because I wasn't happy with what I saw
with<00:04:33.680> the<00:04:33.800> key<00:04:34.040> speaker<00:04:34.490> the<00:04:34.670> lack<00:04:35.420> of

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
with the key speaker the lack of

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:40.330 
with the key speaker the lack of
protection<00:04:35.930> on<00:04:36.200> the<00:04:36.320> front<00:04:36.730> it<00:04:37.730> off<00:04:38.030> there<00:04:39.340> now

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
protection on the front it off there now

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.760 
protection on the front it off there now
you<00:04:40.400> can<00:04:40.610> see<00:04:40.790> here<00:04:41.350> there's<00:04:42.350> not<00:04:42.560> much

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
you can see here there's not much

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.770 
you can see here there's not much
protection<00:04:43.190> on<00:04:43.430> the<00:04:43.520> front<00:04:43.940> as<00:04:44.150> opposed<00:04:44.570> to

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
protection on the front as opposed to

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.530 
protection on the front as opposed to
griffin<00:04:45.260> clarify<00:04:46.070> or<00:04:46.340> the<00:04:46.490> on<00:04:46.730> graphite<00:04:47.270> and

let's<00:04:54.410> do<00:04:54.590> a<00:04:54.620> quick<00:04:54.830> test<00:04:54.920> here<00:04:56.650> let's<00:04:57.650> plug<00:04:57.950> it

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.070 
let's do a quick test here let's plug it

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.150 
let's do a quick test here let's plug it
in<00:04:58.720> see<00:04:59.720> if<00:04:59.810> it<00:04:59.930> works<00:05:00.110> see<00:05:00.470> if<00:05:00.560> I<00:05:00.680> fall<00:05:00.920> in<00:05:01.040> the

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
in see if it works see if I fall in the

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.200 
in see if it works see if I fall in the
three-percent<00:05:01.760> again<00:05:02.120> on<00:05:02.780> this<00:05:03.970> plug<00:05:04.970> it<00:05:05.090> in

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
three-percent again on this plug it in

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.580 
three-percent again on this plug it in
to<00:05:05.540> here<00:05:06.160> okay<00:05:07.160> they're<00:05:07.460> really<00:05:08.060> sound<00:05:08.590> and

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
to here okay they're really sound and

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:16.690 
to here okay they're really sound and
let's<00:05:09.770> see<00:05:09.980> if<00:05:10.160> the<00:05:10.250> charges<00:05:14.530> okay<00:05:15.700> doesn't

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:16.700 
let's see if the charges okay doesn't

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.090 
let's see if the charges okay doesn't
