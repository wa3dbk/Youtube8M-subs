00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
wipers now wiper blades mostly fail

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.880 
wipers now wiper blades mostly fail
because<00:00:29.519> of<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.939> deformations<00:00:30.840> on<00:00:31.080> the

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
because of the deformations on the

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.860 
because of the deformations on the
rubber<00:00:32.189> surface<00:00:32.790> of<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.030> blade<00:00:33.239> itself<00:00:33.630> now

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
rubber surface of the blade itself now

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.139 
rubber surface of the blade itself now
this<00:00:34.020> is<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.230> brand<00:00:34.590> new<00:00:34.800> blade<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.430> as<00:00:35.730> you<00:00:35.969> can

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
this is a brand new blade and as you can

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.010 
this is a brand new blade and as you can
see<00:00:36.450> it's<00:00:36.719> smooth<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.760> deformation<00:00:38.760> free<00:00:39.239> on

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
see it's smooth and deformation free on

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.380 
see it's smooth and deformation free on
the<00:00:40.230> other<00:00:40.379> hand<00:00:40.739> most<00:00:41.250> wipers<00:00:41.790> fail<00:00:42.149> because

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
the other hand most wipers fail because

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.720 
the other hand most wipers fail because
of<00:00:42.600> really<00:00:43.110> small<00:00:43.500> deformations<00:00:44.340> on<00:00:44.550> the

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
of really small deformations on the

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.819 
of really small deformations on the
surface<00:00:45.090> of<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.329> blade<00:00:45.510> such<00:00:46.140> as<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.440> one<00:00:46.649> on

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
surface of the blade such as the one on

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.920 
surface of the blade such as the one on
this<00:00:47.250> blade<00:00:47.579> here<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.300> this<00:00:48.450> is<00:00:48.570> what<00:00:48.750> you

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
this blade here and this is what you

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.720 
this blade here and this is what you
need<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.230> look<00:00:49.379> out<00:00:49.559> for<00:00:49.890> when<00:00:50.190> checking<00:00:50.460> your

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.779 
on the length of the entire wiper blade
itself<00:00:57.390> now<00:00:57.960> you<00:00:58.020> can<00:00:58.289> either<00:00:58.469> measure<00:00:59.219> the

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
itself now you can either measure the

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.060 
itself now you can either measure the
wiper<00:01:00.030> blade<00:01:00.180> on<00:01:00.660> your<00:01:00.690> vehicle<00:01:01.289> or<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:01.890> could
