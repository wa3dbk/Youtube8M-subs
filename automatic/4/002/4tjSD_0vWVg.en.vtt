 after that whole day of course but and 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:24.290
 Saturday night just a reasonable week 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.450

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.950

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.820
 the eye is of course not there 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:32.509
 exuberantly celebrate that Saturday ants 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.490
 stood 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.020

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.579

 Well you have to look at myself 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.170

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.790
 watching or if you can and twitter 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.290
 believe it was talking did it 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.330
 so that without them not flora because 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.360
 then you could become copies anyway and now 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:55.970
 at still dependent and that is yes it is 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.990
 not that it is sin as a content 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.140
 play that 's just a good course 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:02.210
 that's better us 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.850
 Saturday Excelsior Maas Lock plowing 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.860
 forum since the winter break in the 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.119
 away match double you with 4 2 came 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.350
 you twice behind and the market u 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:11.420
 possibly another goal 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.710
 yes that's right all over there 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.659
 difficult to waste the second good 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.070
 plays out but we do n't have to with it 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:16.850
 play of their own of course for them 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.590
 you 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.119
 and with that check mark on all snakes and 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.520
 then the second bow okay, that's why we have to 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.679
 well anticipate should not be yes 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.170
 do the same game just do it 

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:29.119
 well you have the center shut the 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.119
 use flanks with possession 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:34.640
 I find that score by last year in the 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:36.140
 in the sarda outlet what do you expect from it 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.670
 the game through Saturday 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.990
 yes i think they start every day full 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.310
 redecorating they can of course be the third 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.749
 time still win just so their 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.670
 seed enough at stake 

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:45.109
 So not a good season 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.520
 could play out she was safe one 

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:47.960
 we just win something 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.749
 we must oppose that 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.069
 have to play our own game and 

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:53.030
 especially a role for the three points 

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:54.679
 so most important 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.869
 a new one at a decision game 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:58.310
 to be late no we have it 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.319
 just keep everything in your own hands three 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.569
 points ahead of 4 points is enough 

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:04.189
 I do not think you let the far 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:05.749
 come to make decisions for it 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:06.139
 time is needed to finish the news 

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:07.850
 to make 

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:10.130
 then let it mark nuenen what becomes 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.429

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.429
