00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:29.990 
the week videos so today we're gonna be
starting<00:00:28.920> with<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.250> square<00:00:29.490> knot<00:00:29.640> and<00:00:29.699> I'll

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
starting with the square knot and I'll

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.250 
starting with the square knot and I'll
be<00:00:30.119> walking<00:00:30.269> you<00:00:30.510> through<00:00:30.570> not<00:00:30.929> only<00:00:31.140> the

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
be walking you through not only the

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.020 
be walking you through not only the
square<00:00:31.500> knot<00:00:31.650> but<00:00:31.859> some<00:00:32.070> variations<00:00:32.669> of<00:00:32.880> that

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
square knot but some variations of that

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.900 
square knot but some variations of that
as<00:00:33.239> well<00:00:33.420> so<00:00:33.870> let's<00:00:34.020> get<00:00:34.170> right<00:00:34.320> into<00:00:34.500> it<00:00:34.910> okay

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
as well so let's get right into it okay

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.130 
as well so let's get right into it okay
with<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.149> square<00:00:36.390> knot<00:00:36.540> what<00:00:36.719> you've<00:00:36.840> got<00:00:36.989> is

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
with the square knot what you've got is

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.750 
with the square knot what you've got is
a<00:00:37.170> knot<00:00:37.440> that<00:00:37.590> can<00:00:37.800> be<00:00:37.950> strong<00:00:38.190> when<00:00:38.399> properly

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
a knot that can be strong when properly

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.580 
a knot that can be strong when properly
backed<00:00:39.059> up<00:00:39.270> as<00:00:39.510> well<00:00:39.780> as<00:00:39.930> tied<00:00:40.170> in<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.410> few

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
backed up as well as tied in a few

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.380 
backed up as well as tied in a few
different<00:00:40.860> variations<00:00:40.980> so<00:00:41.879> let's<00:00:42.059> go<00:00:42.210> through

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
different variations so let's go through

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.690 
different variations so let's go through
those<00:00:42.620> first<00:00:43.620> of<00:00:43.710> all<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.040> regular<00:00:44.430> square

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
those first of all the regular square

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.779 
those first of all the regular square
knot<00:00:44.910> is<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.629> right<00:00:46.200> over<00:00:46.860> left<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.520> then<00:00:47.760> a

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
knot is a right over left and then a

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.940 
knot is a right over left and then a
left<00:00:48.000> over<00:00:48.210> right<00:00:48.570> so<00:00:48.600> I'll<00:00:49.200> cross<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.530> right

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
left over right so I'll cross the right

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.700 
left over right so I'll cross the right
end<00:00:50.160> over<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.550> left<00:00:50.760> end<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.300> twist<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.410> then

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
end over the left end and twist and then

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.830 
end over the left end and twist and then
I'll<00:00:52.829> cross<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.160> left<00:00:53.969> end<00:00:54.210> over<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.660> right

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
I'll cross the left end over the right

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.069 
I'll cross the left end over the right
end<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.289> twist<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.610> that<00:00:57.360> is<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.570> square<00:00:57.899> knot

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
end and twist and that is a square knot

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.139 
end and twist and that is a square knot
so<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.890> check<00:00:59.100> point<00:00:59.370> in<00:00:59.489> this<00:00:59.670> is<00:00:59.879> that<00:01:00.059> you

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
so the check point in this is that you

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.560 
so the check point in this is that you
have<00:01:00.180> two<00:01:00.660> independently<00:01:01.350> moving<00:01:01.739> loops<00:01:02.570> the

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
have two independently moving loops the

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.509 
have two independently moving loops the
interface<00:01:04.049> like<00:01:04.320> that

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
interface like that

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.820 
interface like that
back<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.659> what<00:01:07.020> I<00:01:07.049> mentioned<00:01:07.110> as<00:01:07.560> far<00:01:07.740> as

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
back to what I mentioned as far as

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.859 
back to what I mentioned as far as
backing<00:01:08.220> up<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.520> not<00:01:08.640> goes<00:01:09.000> what<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.600> want<00:01:09.780> to

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
backing up and not goes what you want to

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.160 
backing up and not goes what you want to
do<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:10.320> simply<00:01:11.280> tie<00:01:11.460> something<00:01:11.970> that<00:01:12.150> is<00:01:12.930> very

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
do is simply tie something that is very

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.780 
do is simply tie something that is very
much<00:01:13.409> like<00:01:13.470> an<00:01:13.799> overhand<00:01:14.250> knot<00:01:14.340> so<00:01:14.670> you're

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
much like an overhand knot so you're

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.640 
much like an overhand knot so you're
going<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.000> go<00:01:15.119> over<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.659> standing<00:01:16.290> part<00:01:16.500> of

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
going to go over the standing part of

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.580 
going to go over the standing part of
the<00:01:16.740> line<00:01:16.979> here<00:01:17.670> with<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.689> tail<00:01:18.930> or<00:01:19.229> they

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
the line here with the tail or they

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.380 
the line here with the tail or they
working<00:01:19.799> in<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.280> then<00:01:20.820> come<00:01:21.119> back<00:01:21.150> through

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
working in and then come back through

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.840 
working in and then come back through
that<00:01:22.350> loop

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
that loop

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.490 
that loop
creating<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.939> backup<00:01:24.150> in<00:01:24.450> one<00:01:24.600> end<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.020> what

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
creating a backup in one end and what

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.960 
creating a backup in one end and what
that<00:01:25.650> will<00:01:25.770> help<00:01:25.890> with<00:01:26.130> is<00:01:26.369> that<00:01:26.580> if<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.820> knot

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
that will help with is that if the knot

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.480 
that will help with is that if the knot
wants<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.479> pull<00:01:27.659> through<00:01:28.080> which<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.220> can't

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
wants to pull through which I can't

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.249 
wants to pull through which I can't
sometimes<00:01:30.119> I<00:01:30.240> can<00:01:30.360> get<00:01:30.450> paracord<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:31.020> do<00:01:31.140> this

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
sometimes I can get paracord to do this

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.560 
sometimes I can get paracord to do this
sometimes<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:31.740> can't<00:01:32.119> so<00:01:33.119> if<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.329> were<00:01:33.420> to

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
sometimes you can't so if it were to

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.870 
sometimes you can't so if it were to
work<00:01:33.720> its<00:01:33.930> way<00:01:34.110> through<00:01:34.140> that<00:01:34.799> knot<00:01:35.579> would

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
work its way through that knot would

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.300 
work its way through that knot would
almost<00:01:36.090> act<00:01:36.390> as<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.570> stopper<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.740> prevent<00:01:38.189> that

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
almost act as a stopper to prevent that

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.600 
almost act as a stopper to prevent that
from<00:01:38.640> pulling<00:01:39.270> through<00:01:39.509> so<00:01:40.350> let<00:01:40.470> me<00:01:40.560> do<00:01:41.490> the

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
from pulling through so let me do the

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.920 
from pulling through so let me do the
other<00:01:41.640> end<00:01:42.030> real<00:01:42.270> quick

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.780 

so<00:01:45.930> again<00:01:46.200> coming<00:01:47.040> around<00:01:47.310> with<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.490> working

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
so again coming around with the working

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.450 
so again coming around with the working
end<00:01:47.970> over<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.450> standing<00:01:48.780> part<00:01:48.930> of<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.079> line

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
end over the standing part of the line

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:55.399 
end over the standing part of the line
back<00:01:50.460> through<00:01:52.610> creating<00:01:53.610> a<00:01:53.670> backup<00:01:53.850> knot<00:01:54.409> so

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
back through creating a backup knot so

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.630 
back through creating a backup knot so
you<00:01:55.470> want<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.680> have<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:55.799> backup<00:01:56.040> in<00:01:56.310> each<00:01:56.399> end

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
you want to have a backup in each end

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.850 
you want to have a backup in each end
and<00:01:56.820> as<00:01:57.030> I<00:01:57.659> mentioned<00:01:58.049> the<00:01:58.229> closer<00:01:58.530> that<00:01:58.799> you

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
and as I mentioned the closer that you

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.679 
and as I mentioned the closer that you
can<00:01:59.130> get<00:01:59.250> these<00:01:59.369> backup<00:01:59.850> knots<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.360> they<00:02:00.540> may

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
can get these backup knots to they may

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.899 
can get these backup knots to they may
not<00:02:00.930> be<00:02:01.409> more<00:02:01.649> effective<00:02:02.130> those<00:02:02.369> will<00:02:02.579> be<00:02:02.729> if

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
not be more effective those will be if

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.600 
not be more effective those will be if
it<00:02:03.119> decides<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:03.780> slip<00:02:03.990> so<00:02:04.950> let's<00:02:05.250> work<00:02:05.399> on<00:02:05.579> some

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
it decides to slip so let's work on some

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.540 
it decides to slip so let's work on some
other<00:02:05.850> variations<00:02:06.210> here<00:02:06.750> if<00:02:07.560> you<00:02:07.829> were<00:02:07.979> to<00:02:08.190> tie

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
other variations here if you were to tie

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.570 
other variations here if you were to tie
the<00:02:08.610> square<00:02:09.060> knot<00:02:09.270> the<00:02:09.479> wrong<00:02:09.720> way<00:02:10.430> it<00:02:11.430> would

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
the square knot the wrong way it would

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.589 
the square knot the wrong way it would
turn<00:02:11.790> into<00:02:11.819> what's<00:02:12.239> called<00:02:12.330> a<00:02:12.599> granny<00:02:12.840> knot

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
turn into what's called a granny knot

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:16.619 
turn into what's called a granny knot
so<00:02:14.079> if<00:02:14.499> I<00:02:14.620> go<00:02:14.799> right<00:02:15.069> over<00:02:15.099> left<00:02:15.519> and<00:02:15.969> then<00:02:16.450> go

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:16.629 
so if I go right over left and then go

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:20.489 
so if I go right over left and then go
right<00:02:16.659> over<00:02:17.109> left<00:02:17.290> again<00:02:17.680> I<00:02:19.230> would<00:02:20.230> get<00:02:20.379> the

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:20.499 
right over left again I would get the

00:02:20.499 --> 00:02:23.129 
right over left again I would get the
granny<00:02:20.739> knot<00:02:21.010> and<00:02:21.280> that's<00:02:21.999> as<00:02:22.389> you<00:02:22.780> can<00:02:22.930> see

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:23.139 
granny knot and that's as you can see

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:25.739 
granny knot and that's as you can see
slips<00:02:23.620> quite<00:02:23.889> a<00:02:23.920> bit<00:02:24.189> it's<00:02:24.849> not<00:02:25.030> very<00:02:25.420> strong

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:25.749 
slips quite a bit it's not very strong

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:28.849 
slips quite a bit it's not very strong
in<00:02:26.049> itself<00:02:26.430> and<00:02:27.430> just<00:02:27.670> the<00:02:27.819> wrong<00:02:28.030> way<00:02:28.060> to<00:02:28.269> tie

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:28.859 
in itself and just the wrong way to tie

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:32.009 
in itself and just the wrong way to tie
the<00:02:29.859> square<00:02:30.129> knot<00:02:30.280> to<00:02:30.400> begin<00:02:30.639> with<00:02:30.819> so<00:02:31.810> there's

00:02:32.009 --> 00:02:32.019 
the square knot to begin with so there's

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:33.509 
the square knot to begin with so there's
some<00:02:32.170> variations<00:02:32.769> of<00:02:32.889> the<00:02:33.010> square<00:02:33.250> knot<00:02:33.370> as

00:02:33.509 --> 00:02:33.519 
some variations of the square knot as

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:35.849 
some variations of the square knot as
well<00:02:33.670> so<00:02:33.969> if<00:02:34.090> I<00:02:34.180> were<00:02:34.299> to<00:02:34.420> tie<00:02:34.599> right<00:02:35.530> over<00:02:35.709> left

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:35.859 
well so if I were to tie right over left

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:37.110 
well so if I were to tie right over left
left<00:02:36.250> over<00:02:36.609> right

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
left over right

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.379 
left over right
you<00:02:37.239> get<00:02:37.389> myself<00:02:37.540> a<00:02:37.810> square<00:02:38.049> knot<00:02:38.230> I<00:02:39.389> can

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:40.389 
you get myself a square knot I can

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:45.030 
you get myself a square knot I can
actually<00:02:41.310> start<00:02:42.310> this<00:02:42.519> by<00:02:43.859> undoing<00:02:44.859> it<00:02:44.950> a

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
actually start this by undoing it a

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.349 
actually start this by undoing it a
little<00:02:45.219> bit<00:02:45.340> and<00:02:45.549> feeding<00:02:45.849> it<00:02:46.030> in<00:02:46.150> back

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:46.359 
little bit and feeding it in back

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:50.759 
little bit and feeding it in back
through<00:02:46.810> and<00:02:47.109> tightening<00:02:47.829> again<00:02:49.620> what<00:02:50.620> that

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
through and tightening again what that

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.580 
through and tightening again what that
gives<00:02:50.950> you<00:02:51.129> there<00:02:51.340> is<00:02:51.760> a<00:02:52.569> slipped<00:02:53.019> square<00:02:53.379> knot

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
gives you there is a slipped square knot

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.459 
gives you there is a slipped square knot
so<00:02:54.219> now<00:02:54.340> by<00:02:54.549> just<00:02:54.719> pulling<00:02:55.719> on<00:02:55.840> this<00:02:56.019> kind<00:02:56.379> of

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:56.469 
so now by just pulling on this kind of

00:02:56.469 --> 00:02:57.959 
so now by just pulling on this kind of
gives<00:02:56.620> me<00:02:56.739> a<00:02:56.829> quick<00:02:57.069> release<00:02:57.250> on<00:02:57.579> my<00:02:57.699> square

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:57.969 
gives me a quick release on my square

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:00.330 
gives me a quick release on my square
knot<00:02:58.150> you<00:02:59.109> can<00:02:59.139> also<00:02:59.409> do<00:02:59.680> that<00:02:59.829> as<00:03:00.040> you're

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
knot you can also do that as you're

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.349 
knot you can also do that as you're
tying<00:03:00.639> too

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:01.359 
tying too

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:03.449 
tying too
so<00:03:01.569> right<00:03:01.959> here<00:03:02.290> as<00:03:02.469> I'm<00:03:02.799> bringing<00:03:03.159> this<00:03:03.250> back

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
so right here as I'm bringing this back

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.089 
so right here as I'm bringing this back
around<00:03:03.819> I<00:03:04.180> can<00:03:04.840> pull<00:03:05.079> through<00:03:05.349> like<00:03:05.560> this<00:03:05.799> and

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
around I can pull through like this and

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:08.429 
around I can pull through like this and
stop<00:03:07.030> it<00:03:07.209> there<00:03:07.389> and<00:03:07.510> create<00:03:07.780> the<00:03:07.930> slip<00:03:08.169> part

00:03:08.429 --> 00:03:08.439 
stop it there and create the slip part

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:10.530 
stop it there and create the slip part
of<00:03:08.530> the<00:03:08.620> slip<00:03:08.829> square<00:03:09.099> knot<00:03:09.310> you<00:03:10.239> can<00:03:10.269> actually

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
of the slip square knot you can actually

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.459 
of the slip square knot you can actually
do<00:03:10.870> a<00:03:10.900> double<00:03:11.530> slip<00:03:11.829> square<00:03:12.159> knot<00:03:12.370> as<00:03:12.760> well<00:03:13.469> so

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:14.469 
do a double slip square knot as well so

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:19.619 
do a double slip square knot as well so
if<00:03:14.560> I<00:03:14.650> were<00:03:14.799> to<00:03:16.590> take<00:03:17.590> this<00:03:17.769> end<00:03:18.040> here<00:03:18.479> and<00:03:19.479> this

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:19.629 
if I were to take this end here and this

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:25.730 
if I were to take this end here and this
end<00:03:19.870> here

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:25.740 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.300 

straighten<00:03:26.700> those<00:03:26.760> out<00:03:27.000> a<00:03:27.030> little<00:03:27.240> bit<00:03:28.310> I'll

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
straighten those out a little bit I'll

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.760 
straighten those out a little bit I'll
get<00:03:29.520> the<00:03:29.670> double<00:03:30.150> slips<00:03:30.420> square<00:03:30.720> knot<00:03:30.870> you<00:03:31.740> can

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
get the double slips square knot you can

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.980 
get the double slips square knot you can
see<00:03:32.040> just<00:03:32.160> by<00:03:32.340> pulling<00:03:32.580> on<00:03:32.760> those<00:03:33.000> it<00:03:33.450> releases

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:33.990 
see just by pulling on those it releases

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.200 
see just by pulling on those it releases
like<00:03:34.170> that<00:03:34.380> there's<00:03:35.220> also<00:03:35.460> what's<00:03:35.850> called<00:03:36.090> a

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:36.210 
like that there's also what's called a

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.150 
like that there's also what's called a
thief's<00:03:36.480> knot<00:03:36.720> and<00:03:37.020> the<00:03:37.320> thief's<00:03:37.560> not<00:03:37.800> dates

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
thief's knot and the thief's not dates

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.890 
thief's knot and the thief's not dates
back<00:03:38.430> to<00:03:39.020> many<00:03:40.020> many<00:03:40.230> years<00:03:40.530> ago<00:03:40.740> and<00:03:41.720> if<00:03:42.720> you

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
back to many many years ago and if you

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.780 
back to many many years ago and if you
look<00:03:43.080> at<00:03:43.230> the<00:03:43.350> structure<00:03:44.190> of<00:03:44.220> the<00:03:44.430> regular

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
look at the structure of the regular

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.730 
look at the structure of the regular
square<00:03:45.030> knot<00:03:45.240> remember<00:03:45.900> I<00:03:45.990> talked<00:03:46.260> about<00:03:46.380> the

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:46.740 
square knot remember I talked about the

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.400 
square knot remember I talked about the
the<00:03:46.770> two<00:03:47.310> loops<00:03:47.550> that<00:03:47.850> are<00:03:48.120> created<00:03:48.540> well<00:03:49.260> with

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
the two loops that are created well with

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.020 
the two loops that are created well with
a<00:03:49.440> typical<00:03:49.920> square<00:03:50.160> knot<00:03:50.340> what<00:03:50.490> you've<00:03:50.610> got<00:03:50.850> or

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
a typical square knot what you've got or

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.240 
a typical square knot what you've got or
your<00:03:51.180> working<00:03:51.390> ends<00:03:51.840> on<00:03:51.960> one<00:03:52.200> side<00:03:52.530> so<00:03:53.010> I

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
your working ends on one side so I

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.670 
your working ends on one side so I
missed<00:03:53.610> there<00:03:53.790> to<00:03:53.970> the<00:03:54.090> top<00:03:54.300> if<00:03:54.750> I<00:03:55.290> were<00:03:55.470> to

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
missed there to the top if I were to

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.950 
missed there to the top if I were to
change<00:03:56.580> this<00:03:56.850> around<00:03:57.150> a<00:03:57.300> little<00:03:57.330> bit<00:03:57.630> I'll

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:57.960 
change this around a little bit I'll

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.660 
change this around a little bit I'll
keep<00:03:58.650> my<00:03:58.800> loop<00:03:59.070> here<00:03:59.870> and<00:04:00.870> I'll<00:04:01.080> keep<00:04:01.260> my

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
keep my loop here and I'll keep my

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.490 
keep my loop here and I'll keep my
working<00:04:02.670> in<00:04:02.790> there<00:04:03.000> if<00:04:03.780> I<00:04:03.900> were<00:04:04.020> to<00:04:04.140> turn<00:04:04.320> this

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
working in there if I were to turn this

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.780 
working in there if I were to turn this
around<00:04:04.680> here<00:04:05.280> and<00:04:05.460> now<00:04:05.760> come<00:04:06.030> over<00:04:06.240> this<00:04:06.720> side

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
around here and now come over this side

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.870 
around here and now come over this side
and<00:04:08.790> around<00:04:08.940> like<00:04:09.330> this<00:04:09.710> now<00:04:10.710> I've<00:04:10.920> got<00:04:11.190> one

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
and around like this now I've got one

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.450 
and around like this now I've got one
working<00:04:12.300> in<00:04:12.420> on<00:04:12.570> the<00:04:12.630> top<00:04:12.840> and<00:04:13.140> one<00:04:14.010> working<00:04:14.220> in

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:14.460 
working in on the top and one working in

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.610 
working in on the top and one working in
on<00:04:14.580> the<00:04:14.670> bottom<00:04:15.000> so<00:04:15.450> it<00:04:15.570> creates<00:04:15.900> what's

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
on the bottom so it creates what's

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:17.960 
on the bottom so it creates what's
called<00:04:16.709> a<00:04:16.890> thief's<00:04:17.130> knot<00:04:17.340> so<00:04:17.610> now<00:04:17.760> if<00:04:17.910> someone

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
called a thief's knot so now if someone

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.600 
called a thief's knot so now if someone
were<00:04:18.330> to<00:04:18.390> come<00:04:18.540> by<00:04:18.900> and<00:04:19.290> retie<00:04:20.160> this<00:04:20.400> because

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:20.610 
were to come by and retie this because

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:22.250 
were to come by and retie this because
they<00:04:20.730> saw<00:04:20.970> it<00:04:21.000> quickly<00:04:21.450> and<00:04:21.600> said<00:04:21.780> oh<00:04:21.810> that's<00:04:22.049> a

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
they saw it quickly and said oh that's a

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.380 
they saw it quickly and said oh that's a
square<00:04:22.590> knot<00:04:22.800> I'll<00:04:22.920> just<00:04:23.070> retie<00:04:23.400> that<00:04:23.670> if<00:04:24.240> they

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
square knot I'll just retie that if they

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.840 
square knot I'll just retie that if they
were<00:04:24.450> to<00:04:24.780> get<00:04:25.440> into<00:04:25.590> a<00:04:25.740> sack<00:04:26.070> or<00:04:26.310> a<00:04:26.370> duffel<00:04:26.730> or

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
were to get into a sack or a duffel or

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.460 
were to get into a sack or a duffel or
something<00:04:27.180> that<00:04:27.300> was<00:04:27.390> tied<00:04:27.690> back<00:04:28.200> in<00:04:28.380> the

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
something that was tied back in the

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.580 
something that was tied back in the
olden<00:04:28.710> days<00:04:29.000> it<00:04:30.000> would<00:04:30.240> try<00:04:30.690> to<00:04:30.720> try<00:04:30.990> as<00:04:31.050> they

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
olden days it would try to try as they

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:32.930 
olden days it would try to try as they
would<00:04:31.710> try<00:04:31.860> to<00:04:31.890> try<00:04:32.130> as<00:04:32.280> tie<00:04:32.610> a<00:04:32.640> square<00:04:32.850> knot

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
would try to try as tie a square knot

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.610 
would try to try as tie a square knot
again<00:04:34.280> which<00:04:35.280> as<00:04:35.460> you<00:04:35.580> can<00:04:35.610> see<00:04:36.380> common<00:04:37.380> square

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
again which as you can see common square

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.830 
again which as you can see common square
knot

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.189 

as<00:04:43.840> those<00:04:44.110> working<00:04:44.289> ends<00:04:44.800> on<00:04:45.069> the<00:04:45.310> same<00:04:45.520> side

00:04:46.189 --> 00:04:46.199 
as those working ends on the same side

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:48.480 
as those working ends on the same side
and<00:04:47.199> that's<00:04:47.439> not<00:04:47.650> a<00:04:47.710> square<00:04:48.009> knot<00:04:48.189> I<00:04:48.340> don't

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
and that's not a square knot I don't

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.879 
and that's not a square knot I don't
know<00:04:48.550> what<00:04:48.699> I<00:04:48.729> just<00:04:48.939> taught<00:04:49.499> so<00:04:50.499> if<00:04:50.560> I<00:04:50.680> were<00:04:50.800> to

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:50.889 
know what I just taught so if I were to

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:54.689 
know what I just taught so if I were to
tie<00:04:51.069> a<00:04:51.099> square<00:04:51.430> knot<00:04:51.520> again<00:04:53.370> as<00:04:54.370> the<00:04:54.520> working

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:54.699 
tie a square knot again as the working

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:56.610 
tie a square knot again as the working
ends<00:04:55.029> on<00:04:55.120> one<00:04:55.300> side<00:04:55.509> versus<00:04:56.020> the<00:04:56.139> thief's<00:04:56.349> knot

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620 
ends on one side versus the thief's knot

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.800 
ends on one side versus the thief's knot
which<00:04:57.310> has<00:04:57.520> the<00:04:57.729> work<00:04:57.879> hands<00:04:58.150> on<00:04:58.300> the<00:04:58.389> opposite

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
which has the work hands on the opposite

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.170 
which has the work hands on the opposite
side<00:04:59.050> so<00:04:59.319> those<00:04:59.860> are<00:05:00.009> some<00:05:00.129> variations<00:05:00.789> of<00:05:01.029> the

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
side so those are some variations of the

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.620 
side so those are some variations of the
square<00:05:01.419> knot<00:05:01.599> and<00:05:01.719> how<00:05:02.020> you<00:05:02.080> can<00:05:02.319> tell<00:05:02.499> them
