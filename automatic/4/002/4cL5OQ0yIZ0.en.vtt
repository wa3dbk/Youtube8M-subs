vector<00:00:25.949> is<00:00:26.130> probably<00:00:26.400> my<00:00:26.580> least<00:00:26.730> favorite

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
vector is probably my least favorite

vector is probably my least favorite
submachine<00:00:27.510> gun<00:00:27.689> I<00:00:27.960> think<00:00:28.230> it's<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.470> worst

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
submachine gun I think it's the worst

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.959 
submachine gun I think it's the worst
one<00:00:29.070> in<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.250> game<00:00:29.429> uh<00:00:31.700> for<00:00:32.700> all<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.880> other

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
one in the game uh for all the other

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.510 
one in the game uh for all the other
ones<00:00:33.120> over<00:00:33.329> it<00:00:33.450> but<00:00:34.230> it's<00:00:34.980> okay<00:00:35.280> with<00:00:35.430> that

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
ones over it but it's okay with that

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.549 
ones over it but it's okay with that
from<00:00:35.670> Jay<00:00:35.910> I<00:00:36.090> just<00:00:36.420> don't<00:00:37.050> really<00:00:37.140> like<00:00:37.260> it

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
from Jay I just don't really like it

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.940 
from Jay I just don't really like it
that<00:00:37.590> much<00:00:37.770> any<00:00:38.579> other<00:00:39.120> attachment<00:00:39.950> spaz

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
that much any other attachment spaz

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.299 
that much any other attachment spaz
twelves<00:00:41.399> over<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.910> powerful<00:00:42.480> secondary<00:00:43.020> I<00:00:43.320> like

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
twelves over a powerful secondary I like

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.139 
twelves over a powerful secondary I like
it<00:00:44.430> with<00:00:44.489> either<00:00:44.640> group<00:00:44.879> or<00:00:45.059> FMJ<00:00:45.539> uh<00:00:46.910> it's<00:00:47.910> just

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
it with either group or FMJ uh it's just

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.540 
it with either group or FMJ uh it's just
good<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.600> have<00:00:48.809> as<00:00:49.020> backup<00:00:49.500> for<00:00:49.950> any<00:00:50.160> in<00:00:50.340> tight

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
good to have as backup for any in tight

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.040 
good to have as backup for any in tight
situations<00:00:51.050> it's<00:00:52.050> uh<00:00:53.030> I<00:00:54.030> use<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.539> few<00:00:54.570> for<00:00:55.020> a

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
situations it's uh I use it a few for a

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.529 
situations it's uh I use it a few for a
few<00:00:55.199> kills<00:00:55.379> in<00:00:55.500> this<00:00:55.620> game<00:00:55.800> I<00:00:56.390> rushed<00:00:57.390> up<00:00:57.510> the

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
few kills in this game I rushed up the

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.090 
few kills in this game I rushed up the
left<00:00:57.750> side<00:00:57.899> at<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.079> beginning<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.739> I<00:00:58.859> run

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
left side at the beginning and I run

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.049 
left side at the beginning and I run
over<00:00:59.359> on<00:01:00.440> flank<00:01:01.440> around<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:02.219> my<00:01:02.730> kill<00:01:02.910> gets

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
over on flank around and my kill gets

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.910 
over on flank around and my kill gets
robbed<00:01:03.300> right<00:01:03.510> there<00:01:03.750> but<00:01:03.989> my<00:01:04.080> teammate<00:01:04.439> but

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
robbed right there but my teammate but

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:05.929 
robbed right there but my teammate but
whatever<00:01:05.280> it<00:01:05.400> doesn't<00:01:05.519> really<00:01:05.610> matter<00:01:05.820> that

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
whatever it doesn't really matter that

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.580 
whatever it doesn't really matter that
much<00:01:07.220> he<00:01:08.220> still<00:01:08.430> does<00:01:08.580> anyway<00:01:08.990> and<00:01:09.990> I<00:01:10.439> get

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
much he still does anyway and I get

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:11.750 
much he still does anyway and I get
killed<00:01:10.799> right<00:01:10.860> there<00:01:11.159> which<00:01:11.340> was<00:01:11.430> my<00:01:11.610> only

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
killed right there which was my only

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.399 
killed right there which was my only
death<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.150> game<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:14.780> this<00:01:15.780> guy's<00:01:16.110> left

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
death of the game and this guy's left

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.800 
death of the game and this guy's left
last<00:01:16.619> alive<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.400> he<00:01:17.790> ends<00:01:18.119> up<00:01:18.210> clutching<00:01:18.509> it

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
last alive and he ends up clutching it

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.020 
last alive and he ends up clutching it
with<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.290> couple<00:01:19.619> kills<00:01:19.799> from<00:01:19.979> his<00:01:20.189> pp-2000

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
with the couple kills from his pp-2000

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.690 
with the couple kills from his pp-2000
just<00:01:21.930> kind<00:01:22.080> of<00:01:22.110> funny<00:01:22.350> cuz<00:01:22.590> pp-2000<00:01:23.490> it's

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
just kind of funny cuz pp-2000 it's

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.410 
just kind of funny cuz pp-2000 it's
actually<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.390> could<00:01:25.049> be<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.200> primary<00:01:25.970> I<00:01:26.970> think

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
actually a could be a primary I think

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.850 
actually a could be a primary I think
it's<00:01:27.509> better<00:01:27.659> than<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.869> vector<00:01:28.229> actually<00:01:28.680> i

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
it's better than the vector actually i

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.920 
it's better than the vector actually i
can<00:01:29.400> probably<00:01:29.579> get<00:01:29.790> just<00:01:30.030> as<00:01:30.570> good<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.720> game

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
can probably get just as good a game

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.910 
can probably get just as good a game
using<00:01:31.290> this<00:01:33.290> that's<00:01:34.290> really<00:01:34.439> good<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:34.680> see<00:01:34.829> it

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
using this that's really good you see it

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.080 
using this that's really good you see it
only<00:01:35.009> took<00:01:35.159> a<00:01:35.250> couple<00:01:35.280> bullets<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.850> kill<00:01:35.880> him

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
only took a couple bullets to kill him

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:43.310 
only took a couple bullets to kill him
there<00:01:36.210> even<00:01:36.450> without<00:01:36.659> stopping<00:01:37.049> power<00:01:37.200> oh<00:01:42.320> so

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
there even without stopping power oh so

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.050 
there even without stopping power oh so
let's<00:01:43.590> wait<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:43.950> watch<00:01:44.009> this<00:01:44.369> guy<00:01:44.579> gets<00:01:44.909> the

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
let's wait and watch this guy gets the

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:52.719 
let's wait and watch this guy gets the
last<00:01:45.210> kill<00:01:45.479> or<00:01:45.689> know<00:01:45.810> soon<00:01:46.079> enough

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.660 

so<00:01:53.729> moving<00:01:54.270> on<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.539> round<00:01:54.719> two<00:01:55.460> just<00:01:56.460> game<00:01:56.640> when

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
so moving on to round two just game when

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:04.810 
so moving on to round two just game when
go<00:01:56.939> can

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.880 

so<00:02:05.450> now<00:02:05.570> we<00:02:05.630> move<00:02:05.870> on<00:02:06.080> to<00:02:06.110> round<00:02:06.500> two<00:02:06.830> I<00:02:08.740> rush<00:02:09.740> up

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
so now we move on to round two I rush up

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.970 
so now we move on to round two I rush up
the<00:02:10.009> same<00:02:10.220> west<00:02:10.550> side<00:02:11.410> open<00:02:12.410> somebody<00:02:12.830> would

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
the same west side open somebody would

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.930 
the same west side open somebody would
change<00:02:13.220> their<00:02:13.400> route<00:02:13.690> but<00:02:14.690> no<00:02:15.020> one<00:02:15.200> does

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
change their route but no one does

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.680 
change their route but no one does
unfortunately<00:02:17.020> so<00:02:18.020> I<00:02:18.760> ran<00:02:19.760> up<00:02:19.850> the<00:02:19.940> stairs<00:02:20.240> and

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
unfortunately so I ran up the stairs and

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.860 
unfortunately so I ran up the stairs and
go<00:02:21.320> around<00:02:21.440> top<00:02:21.860> two<00:02:22.370> so<00:02:23.360> I<00:02:23.420> figured<00:02:23.720> they

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
go around top two so I figured they

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.300 
go around top two so I figured they

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
good for rushing on defense because they

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.310 
good for rushing on defense because they
can<00:03:34.459> get<00:03:34.610> upstairs<00:03:35.269> quicker<00:03:35.900> than<00:03:35.989> you<00:03:36.140> and

guy chases after me and I blow his head
off<00:04:01.570> which<00:04:02.570> is<00:04:02.690> why<00:04:02.810> it's<00:04:02.930> always<00:04:03.170> nice<00:04:03.350> to

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
off which is why it's always nice to

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.949 
off which is why it's always nice to
have<00:04:03.799> a<00:04:04.760> secondary<00:04:05.269> that's<00:04:05.510> better<00:04:05.690> than<00:04:05.840> your

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
have a secondary that's better than your

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.800 
have a secondary that's better than your
primary<00:04:06.350> close<00:04:06.769> up<00:04:07.420> it's<00:04:08.420> really<00:04:08.510> good<00:04:08.630> in

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
primary close up it's really good in

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.660 
primary close up it's really good in
tight<00:04:08.930> situations<00:04:09.110> and<00:04:09.950> that's<00:04:10.130> also<00:04:10.340> why<00:04:10.610> you

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
tight situations and that's also why you

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.970 
tight situations and that's also why you
don't<00:04:10.940> chase<00:04:11.209> people<00:04:11.450> around<00:04:11.690> corners<00:04:12.140> they

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
don't chase people around corners they

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.979 
don't chase people around corners they
have<00:04:13.250> the<00:04:13.370> advantage<00:04:13.790> over<00:04:13.820> you<00:04:14.120> you<00:04:14.750> know<00:04:14.930> if

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
have the advantage over you you know if

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:16.030 
have the advantage over you you know if
you<00:04:15.079> think<00:04:15.230> if<00:04:15.350> you<00:04:15.440> shot<00:04:15.620> him<00:04:15.680> a<00:04:15.769> couple<00:04:15.949> times

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 
you think if you shot him a couple times

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.160 
you think if you shot him a couple times
with<00:04:16.310> advantage<00:04:16.669> over<00:04:16.820> them

with advantage over them

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:18.780 
with advantage over them
it's<00:04:17.710> not<00:04:17.800> really<00:04:17.950> how<00:04:18.130> it<00:04:18.160> works<00:04:18.220> they<00:04:18.640> know

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790 
it's not really how it works they know

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.580 
it's not really how it works they know
you're<00:04:18.940> coming<00:04:18.970> they<00:04:19.900> can<00:04:20.050> take<00:04:20.140> up<00:04:20.290> a<00:04:20.380> better

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
you're coming they can take up a better

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.830 
you're coming they can take up a better
position<00:04:20.740> than<00:04:21.040> you<00:04:21.280> switch<00:04:22.210> there's<00:04:22.480> like<00:04:22.660> a

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
position than you switch there's like a

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.440 
position than you switch there's like a
shotgun<00:04:23.080> if<00:04:23.350> they<00:04:23.470> have<00:04:23.620> it<00:04:24.030> and<00:04:26.010> that's<00:04:27.010> just

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
shotgun if they have it and that's just

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.290 
shotgun if they have it and that's just
how<00:04:28.450> it<00:04:29.410> works<00:04:29.670> this<00:04:30.670> where<00:04:30.820> i<00:04:30.850> should<00:04:30.940> good

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
how it works this where i should good

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.960

shields<00:04:34.240> really<00:04:34.480> ineffective<00:04:34.720> unless<00:04:35.200> you're

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
shields really ineffective unless you're

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.380 
shields really ineffective unless you're
one<00:04:35.530> big<00:04:35.710> one<00:04:35.890> and<00:04:36.160> like<00:04:36.370> a<00:04:36.430> really<00:04:36.940> small

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:37.390 
one big one and like a really small

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:39.600 
one big one and like a really small
situation<00:04:37.630> but<00:04:38.500> even<00:04:38.710> then<00:04:38.860> most<00:04:39.310> people

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
situation but even then most people

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:40.680 
situation but even then most people
figured<00:04:39.820> out<00:04:39.910> that<00:04:40.030> you<00:04:40.090> can<00:04:40.210> just<00:04:40.270> like<00:04:40.420> run

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
to the side and knife real quick and you

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.790 
to the side and knife real quick and you
can<00:04:42.400> usually<00:04:42.580> get<00:04:42.850> them<00:04:42.970> or<00:04:43.750> just<00:04:44.260> lay<00:04:44.770> down

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800

can usually get them or just lay down
and<00:04:44.980> shoot<00:04:45.250> their<00:04:45.370> feet<00:04:45.550> which<00:04:46.030> is<00:04:46.150> you<00:04:46.300> do

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:49.920 
what I do Russia's actually a lot of fun
to<00:04:48.880> use<00:04:49.000> when<00:04:49.150> this<00:04:49.240> game<00:04:49.390> first<00:04:49.450> came<00:04:49.720> out

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
to use when this game first came out

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.060 
to use when this game first came out
because<00:04:50.050> nobody<00:04:50.410> really<00:04:50.470> knew<00:04:50.710> how<00:04:50.800> to<00:04:50.860> deal

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070

because nobody really knew how to deal
with<00:04:51.130> them<00:04:51.310> and<00:04:52.000> you<00:04:52.090> could<00:04:52.240> just<00:04:52.450> run<00:04:53.440> people

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680
