so servin with this racket was a very
forgiving<00:00:09.970> it's<00:00:10.360> a<00:00:10.630> lot<00:00:10.900> lighter<00:00:11.110> weight<00:00:11.290> than

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:11.650 
forgiving it's a lot lighter weight than

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.200 
forgiving it's a lot lighter weight than
the<00:00:11.770> other<00:00:11.920> two<00:00:12.130> rackets<00:00:12.550> in<00:00:12.670> this<00:00:12.820> series

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:13.210 
the other two rackets in this series

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:15.450 
the other two rackets in this series
it's<00:00:13.510> got<00:00:13.630> a<00:00:13.660> much<00:00:13.840> bigger<00:00:14.050> head<00:00:14.740> size<00:00:15.040> and<00:00:15.370> a

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:15.460 
it's got a much bigger head size and a

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.250 
it's got a much bigger head size and a
much<00:00:15.640> more<00:00:15.820> open<00:00:15.880> string<00:00:16.480> pattern<00:00:16.780> so<00:00:17.080> you<00:00:17.140> can

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:17.260 
much more open string pattern so you can

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.900 
much more open string pattern so you can
get<00:00:17.380> a<00:00:17.410> lot<00:00:17.560> more<00:00:17.590> spin<00:00:18.040> you<00:00:18.430> can't<00:00:18.670> get<00:00:18.820> the

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:18.910 
get a lot more spin you can't get the

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.240 
get a lot more spin you can't get the
kind<00:00:19.090> of<00:00:19.210> penetration<00:00:19.690> and<00:00:20.140> pace<00:00:20.830> of<00:00:20.860> board

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.250 
kind of penetration and pace of board

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:22.770 
kind of penetration and pace of board
you<00:00:21.400> can<00:00:21.580> off<00:00:21.760> the<00:00:21.789> other<00:00:22.000> two<00:00:22.180> but<00:00:22.539> that<00:00:22.630> is

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:22.780 
you can off the other two but that is

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.180 
you can off the other two but that is
down<00:00:22.990> to<00:00:23.170> the<00:00:23.200> weight<00:00:23.470> and<00:00:23.680> the<00:00:23.740> fact<00:00:23.920> it's

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:24.190 
down to the weight and the fact it's

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.340 
down to the weight and the fact it's
kind<00:00:24.430> of<00:00:24.490> a<00:00:24.580> different<00:00:24.850> racket<00:00:25.230> although<00:00:26.230> it

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:26.350 
kind of a different racket although it

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.689 
kind of a different racket although it
is<00:00:26.470> in<00:00:26.619> the<00:00:26.680> same<00:00:26.890> series<00:00:27.430> I'm<00:00:27.760> not<00:00:28.240> sure<00:00:28.680> it

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
is in the same series I'm not sure it

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.130 
is in the same series I'm not sure it
plays<00:00:30.699> exactly<00:00:31.270> the<00:00:31.390> same<00:00:31.570> because<00:00:31.779> it<00:00:32.020> is

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.140 
plays exactly the same because it is

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.619 
plays exactly the same because it is
lighter<00:00:32.519> if<00:00:33.519> you're<00:00:33.699> looking<00:00:33.999> for<00:00:34.239> a<00:00:34.269> racket

00:00:34.619 --> 00:00:34.629 
lighter if you're looking for a racket

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:36.329 
lighter if you're looking for a racket
to<00:00:34.749> start<00:00:35.050> off<00:00:35.170> in<00:00:35.319> the<00:00:35.409> Signature<00:00:35.859> Series<00:00:35.890> and

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:36.339 
to start off in the Signature Series and

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:38.099 
to start off in the Signature Series and
then<00:00:36.399> build<00:00:36.699> your<00:00:36.850> way<00:00:36.969> up<00:00:36.999> to<00:00:37.120> the<00:00:37.300> 95<00:00:37.899> or

00:00:38.099 --> 00:00:38.109 
then build your way up to the 95 or

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:40.020 
then build your way up to the 95 or
maybe<00:00:38.319> even<00:00:38.589> the<00:00:38.679> 90<00:00:39.039> this<00:00:39.460> is<00:00:39.519> a<00:00:39.640> good<00:00:39.850> place

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
maybe even the 90 this is a good place

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.849 
maybe even the 90 this is a good place
to<00:00:40.059> start<00:00:40.479> for<00:00:41.019> me<00:00:41.079> I'd<00:00:41.319> have<00:00:41.440> a<00:00:41.499> lot<00:00:41.710> more

00:00:41.849 --> 00:00:41.859 
to start for me I'd have a lot more

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:42.599 
to start for me I'd have a lot more
weight<00:00:42.069> to<00:00:42.309> it

00:00:42.599 --> 00:00:42.609 
weight to it

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:44.849 
weight to it
try<00:00:43.329> and<00:00:43.449> get<00:00:43.600> more<00:00:43.870> of<00:00:44.019> a<00:00:44.109> penetrating<00:00:44.589> shot

00:00:44.849 --> 00:00:44.859 
try and get more of a penetrating shot

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:47.129 
try and get more of a penetrating shot
as<00:00:44.979> you<00:00:45.010> do<00:00:45.219> from<00:00:45.460> something<00:00:45.819> like<00:00:45.940> the<00:00:46.089> 95<00:00:46.420> the

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:47.139 
as you do from something like the 95 the

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:48.869 
as you do from something like the 95 the
spin<00:00:47.379> you<00:00:47.409> could<00:00:47.649> get<00:00:47.800> off<00:00:47.889> this<00:00:48.039> frame<00:00:48.339> with

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879 
spin you could get off this frame with

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:50.430 
spin you could get off this frame with
groundstrokes<00:00:49.510> was<00:00:49.780> excellent<00:00:50.260> especially

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
groundstrokes was excellent especially

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.079 
groundstrokes was excellent especially
comes<00:00:50.920> out<00:00:51.129> comparison<00:00:51.760> to<00:00:51.879> the<00:00:51.940> other

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:52.089 
comes out comparison to the other

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:53.819 
comes out comparison to the other
tyrannize<00:00:52.539> again<00:00:53.109> due<00:00:53.289> to<00:00:53.319> the<00:00:53.499> forgiveness

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 
tyrannize again due to the forgiveness

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:56.250 
tyrannize again due to the forgiveness
which<00:00:54.129> we've<00:00:54.309> been<00:00:54.460> talking<00:00:54.729> about<00:00:54.789> also<00:00:55.690> the

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
which we've been talking about also the

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.289 
which we've been talking about also the
volleys<00:00:56.620> much<00:00:57.219> more<00:00:57.429> forgiving<00:00:57.639> much<00:00:58.059> more

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:58.299 
volleys much more forgiving much more

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:00.660 
volleys much more forgiving much more
maneuverable<00:00:58.569> feel<00:00:59.079> to<00:00:59.260> this<00:00:59.409> racket<00:00:59.829> due<00:01:00.549> to

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
maneuverable feel to this racket due to

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.639 
maneuverable feel to this racket due to
the<00:01:00.760> lightweight<00:01:00.969> and<00:01:01.299> obviously<00:01:02.170> again<00:01:02.440> the

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:02.649 
the lightweight and obviously again the

the lightweight and obviously again the
biggest<00:01:02.829> sweet<00:01:03.069> spot<00:01:03.280> you<00:01:03.309> can<00:01:03.459> make<00:01:03.609> you<00:01:03.699> just

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
biggest sweet spot you can make you just

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.459 
biggest sweet spot you can make you just
put<00:01:04.059> your<00:01:04.149> racket<00:01:04.299> there<00:01:04.659> let<00:01:04.930> the<00:01:05.019> racket<00:01:05.350> do

or maybe maybe your fitness is not to it
it<00:01:40.479> really<00:01:40.539> is<00:01:40.899> a<00:01:40.960> tough<00:01:41.109> racket<00:01:41.229> to<00:01:41.409> play<00:01:41.560> with

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
it really is a tough racket to play with

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:42.929 
it really is a tough racket to play with
it<00:01:41.799> which<00:01:41.890> is<00:01:41.920> where<00:01:42.130> this<00:01:42.280> comes<00:01:42.609> in<00:01:42.789> as

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:42.939 
it which is where this comes in as

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:45.419 
it which is where this comes in as
either<00:01:43.420> a<00:01:43.539> transitional<00:01:44.499> racket<00:01:44.799> or<00:01:44.950> a<00:01:44.979> racket

00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:45.429 
either a transitional racket or a racket

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:46.800 
either a transitional racket or a racket
that<00:01:45.700> can<00:01:45.850> make<00:01:46.030> you<00:01:46.149> feel<00:01:46.179> as<00:01:46.600> though<00:01:46.689> you're

playing<00:01:46.869> with<00:01:47.079> this<00:01:47.170> one<00:01:47.399> it<00:01:48.399> does<00:01:48.579> have<00:01:48.789> good

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 
playing with this one it does have good

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:51.149 
playing with this one it does have good
feel<00:01:49.179> it<00:01:49.450> does<00:01:49.689> have<00:01:49.929> good<00:01:50.140> spin<00:01:50.409> and<00:01:50.740> as<00:01:50.950> John

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
feel it does have good spin and as John

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:54.779 
feel it does have good spin and as John
says<00:01:51.369> this<00:01:52.359> the<00:01:52.570> power<00:01:52.749> is<00:01:52.960> is<00:01:53.170> low<00:01:53.579> but<00:01:54.579> it's

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:54.789 
says this the power is is low but it's

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:56.160 
says this the power is is low but it's
the<00:01:54.880> same<00:01:55.030> with<00:01:55.210> all<00:01:55.329> of<00:01:55.450> all<00:01:55.719> of<00:01:55.869> this<00:01:55.960> range

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
the same with all of all of this range

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.779 
the same with all of all of this range
of<00:01:56.259> rackets<00:01:56.679> I<00:01:56.770> personally<00:01:57.579> think<00:01:57.700> that

00:01:57.779 --> 00:01:57.789 
of rackets I personally think that

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:59.069 
of rackets I personally think that
Wilson<00:01:58.149> has<00:01:58.240> done<00:01:58.359> a<00:01:58.390> decent<00:01:58.569> job<00:01:58.810> with<00:01:58.869> this

00:01:59.069 --> 00:01:59.079 
Wilson has done a decent job with this

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:03.450 
Wilson has done a decent job with this
of<00:01:59.979> creating<00:02:00.569> a<00:02:01.569> racket<00:02:02.380> as<00:02:02.530> a<00:02:02.859> mimic<00:02:03.310> of

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
of creating a racket as a mimic of

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:04.739 
of creating a racket as a mimic of
another<00:02:03.789> and<00:02:04.060> I<00:02:04.179> think<00:02:04.390> that<00:02:04.509> they've<00:02:04.600> done<00:02:04.689> a

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:04.749 
another and I think that they've done a

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:06.450 
another and I think that they've done a
great<00:02:04.869> job<00:02:04.960> of<00:02:05.140> doing<00:02:05.200> it<00:02:05.499> and<00:02:05.649> it's<00:02:05.890> oh<00:02:06.009> it's<00:02:06.189> a

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
great job of doing it and it's oh it's a

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.969 
great job of doing it and it's oh it's a
racket<00:02:06.729> that<00:02:07.030> has<00:02:07.659> been<00:02:07.929> needed<00:02:08.470> in<00:02:08.860> the

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
racket that has been needed in the

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.350 
racket that has been needed in the
Wilson<00:02:09.160> range<00:02:09.550> and<00:02:09.820> I<00:02:09.940> think<00:02:10.120> they've<00:02:10.210> done<00:02:10.240> a

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
Wilson range and I think they've done a

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.000 
Wilson range and I think they've done a
good<00:02:10.450> job<00:02:10.510> of<00:02:10.720> it<00:02:10.810> so<00:02:11.050> if<00:02:11.620> you<00:02:11.740> want<00:02:11.860> to<00:02:11.890> check
