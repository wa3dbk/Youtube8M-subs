he's worth going for about 20 to 25 k
it's<00:02:19.080> a<00:02:19.170> big<00:02:19.379> investment<00:02:19.530> for<00:02:20.069> a<00:02:20.099> centre-back

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
it's a big investment for a centre-back

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.490 
it's a big investment for a centre-back
and<00:02:20.849> of<00:02:21.180> course<00:02:21.239> the<00:02:21.569> game<00:02:21.750> is<00:02:21.900> now<00:02:22.019> based<00:02:22.290> on

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
and of course the game is now based on

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.729 
and of course the game is now based on
strength<00:02:22.800> rather<00:02:23.370> than<00:02:23.760> on<00:02:24.000> pace<00:02:24.450> as<00:02:24.750> much<00:02:25.379> so

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
strength rather than on pace as much so

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.920 
strength rather than on pace as much so
for<00:02:26.220> me<00:02:26.370> with<00:02:26.519> his<00:02:26.670> 77<00:02:27.209> strength<00:02:27.480> he<00:02:27.599> does<00:02:27.810> get

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
for me with his 77 strength he does get

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.300 
for me with his 77 strength he does get
buried<00:02:28.260> off<00:02:28.379> the<00:02:28.530> ball<00:02:28.709> if<00:02:28.830> you<00:02:28.950> put<00:02:29.160> him<00:02:29.280> up

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
buried off the ball if you put him up

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.000 
buried off the ball if you put him up
against<00:02:29.760> Drogba<00:02:30.209> put<00:02:30.720> him<00:02:30.840> up<00:02:30.930> against<00:02:31.290> boney

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
put him up against inform Diego Costa

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.110 
put him up against inform Diego Costa
Hulk<00:02:34.590> any<00:02:34.860> of<00:02:35.040> those<00:02:35.190> players<00:02:35.489> then<00:02:35.819> he<00:02:35.910> does

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.530 
get nudged off the ball when he's off
balance<00:02:37.640> so<00:02:38.640> you've<00:02:38.790> got<00:02:38.819> to<00:02:39.090> be<00:02:39.180> aware<00:02:39.299> of

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
balance so you've got to be aware of

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.360 
balance so you've got to be aware of
that<00:02:39.720> and<00:02:40.080> that's<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:40.709> thing<00:02:40.830> he<00:02:40.950> does<00:02:41.129> have<00:02:41.310> a

that and that's the thing he does have a

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.550 
that and that's the thing he does have a
decent<00:02:41.790> long-range<00:02:42.480> pass<00:02:42.780> in<00:02:43.019> anyway<00:02:43.379> that's

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
decent long-range pass in anyway that's

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.140 
decent long-range pass in anyway that's
based<00:02:43.769> with<00:02:43.920> his<00:02:44.069> all-round<00:02:44.280> stance<00:02:44.730> he<00:02:44.849> is<00:02:44.940> so

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
based with his all-round stance he is so

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.120 
based with his all-round stance he is so
well-balanced<00:02:45.900> and<00:02:46.019> he<00:02:46.500> does<00:02:46.680> wonder<00:02:46.950> up<00:02:47.040> the

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
well-balanced and he does wonder up the
