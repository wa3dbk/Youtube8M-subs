00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:10.769
 What is Pilates 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:14.710
 It is an exercise invented by a German man 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:18.620
 Originally the man was weak in his body 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:26.110
 I made it to improve it 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:27.820
 Use your own breathing techniques for regular Pilates exercises and 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.070
 I have no injuries 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:34.790
 To make a body 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:36.770
 We will continue to exercise so that we create a functional body 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.800
 As an effect 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:43.150
 First Watte the central part of the body has come 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:47.380
 The attitude gets better 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:51.100
 Then how to move the body in daily life 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.730
 You can learn how to move 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:58.579
 Also 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:01:02.230
 You can also improve your endurance and flexibility 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:04.640
 Well thanks for starting Pilates 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:08.810
 Stiff neck is I have gone at all 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.840
 Once upon a time the neck and shoulders went always enough not to sleep anymore 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.280
 but 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:18.530
 I felt like I really picked up a lot of money 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:20.720
 After that, if you play Pilates, you will move in various ways 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:25.580
 Because I will study 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:28.210
 You have to be aware of these places when doing any action 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.620
 It came to understand 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.760
 Pilates 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:35.320
 Those who lack exercise from usual 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:40.040
 Also It's right 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:45.410
 For example , if you are running, you are just running 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:46.470
 If you can improve the effect by pilates the running 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:53.370
 Or 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:55.409
 Any form is acceptable as it is the basis of the body number for all exercises 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:02:01.170
 I think 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:02.640
 Inflexible people can also improve their flexibility little by little by pilates 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.620
 I can 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.929
 The person who is not strong is also suddenly 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:15.019
 It's not about doing something exciting and exciting 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:17.310
 It is a great recommendation because it is an exercise that makes the axis from the center little by little 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:19.620
 think 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.799
 Come on Latie Xisa Saizo 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.799
 Let's
