00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:16.020
 This is just the first I had my friends the 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.880
 Today's topic are releases and more 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.430
 releases the idea of ​​the video 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.810
 appeared with the comment of a partner 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.000
 Access here the channel 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.340
 he commented something like the beginning because 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.320
 do not make a video about kiko intended 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.910
 buy 100 of the releases 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.279
 So what I did I gave a searched 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.070
 in several releases from various publishers 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.739
 and I made a selection like that 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:42.750
 interests as any reader who 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:45.600
 understood that I am not in beauty beginning 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.300
 with the marvel God loves a man who kills 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.280
 one of those 80's written by 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.440
 I exclaim to those who do not know this 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.480
 comic he served as reference for 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.090
 the second film of the segment and that is a 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.090
 Very cool movie and I never read it but it is 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.739
 considered one of the most 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.539
 segment driven by yen 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.930
 example that is that American site 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.479
 nice he puts god loves man kills in 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.549
 third of the best stories of 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.320
 growth of all time and 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.060
 is launching at a great price 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.340
 it costs 22 90 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.409
 not worth trying to also leave the already 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.479
 left there then mine there in são paulo 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.880
 damage is a sponsor who 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.070
 basically proposes to count the 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.470
 story of the years she takes from the time 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.360
 of his childhood I read about three or 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.090
 four months if I'm not mistaken and I liked it 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.490
 so it has not changed my life end but it is 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.960
 It was a lot of fun and time to invest 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.060
 This priest even because I wanted to 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.979
 know more damages on account of 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.780
 third movie of the avengers which is a 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.790
 hq that clarifies enough of the past 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.950
 we also have two releases of the 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.720
 classic first phase demolisher of the 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.460
 frank miller who gave a delay in 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.500
 truth from what I saw will be child 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.290
 bound in taking this whole phase he 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.329
 a lot of it and I really liked Frank 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.119
 miller and saved the demolisher's magazine 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.520
 of a cancellation and also created a lot of 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.250
 character mythology thing 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.550
 ninjas for example electra are 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.869
 basically urban stories commit 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.910
 facing the underworld of crime is worth 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.500
 It's a good feeling that it's a phase that is not only 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.970
 written by frank miller 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.550
 drawn by him also another 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.800
 launch is the sixth chained stage 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.530
 from the sea ​​that Egypt is the demolisher 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.450
 this chained census ends the first 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.670
 phase of it for the character that I am 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.440
 enjoying so much too tata 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.340
 fun is even stranger thus 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.740
 explain 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.600
 in the case of the mark and after that mark 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.100
 sixth bound he continued 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.050
 writing demolisher 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.120
 only that the marvel solved uses the 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.890
 numbering of the journal but did not 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.620
 creative team until this very week 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.930
 cell was the first chained from this 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.290
 second phase of the demolisher we turn to 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.340
 that the company continue to launch 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.920
 bound and do not put a demolisher on 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.230
 some monthly type the marvel universe 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.050
 another delayed release that was in the 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.090
 checklist prior to the dynasty m 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.470
 I think a legal exit was without a 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.840
 marvel version of alex 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.090
 I like it so much from dynasty m 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.310
 be an alternative reality I do not know 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.870
 I can not read these stories without 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.690
 keep thinking like this when I go 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.850
 looking kind there is a little here everything is going 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.739
 go back to how it was and none of it was worth 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.150
 the pity knows but it is a legal exit until 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:21.060
 because this is an alternative reality 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.890
 which had some relevant consequence 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.019
 for the marvelous universe, especially in 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.820
 part of the mutants has changed a lot and 

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.950
 who is not threatened the beloved favorite 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.620
 but it's legal right another release that 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.959
 I was waiting so much better. 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.970
 host which is a hq 80 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.950
 written by love when the comics 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.010
 superheroes who are so influential and 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.380
 important of his time recently 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.180
 marvel she acquired the rights to 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.250
 character's publication and is 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.440
 Publishing out here in Brazil 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.720
 regrettably the policy will publish 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.390
 as a monthly magazine until I saw a lot 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.100
 people complaining about it really is 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.799
 unfortunate so it would be much more 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.720
 legal 6 bound direct mask is the 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:03.000
 pane is not that she will make it goes 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.540

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.090
 purchase 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.100
 then she will cast the incarnate and the 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.019
 people will also buy in the type and 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.970
 another release is the fourth name of 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:14.459
 christian that in fact has already left the 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.560

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:18.810
 very good look read fill face

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.500
 and that it is being relaunched has 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.030
 first volumes makes rock totally 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.039
 There's even a video here in the 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.389
 channel in case you are interested beauty 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:29.789
 also this year 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:31.439
 You must leave the send me an other cup or 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:33.539
 beginning of next year which is a new 

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:34.439
 series of pen written by himself 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:36.360
 game 

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:38.610
 just see that I have not arrived yet but the 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.710
 felipe aquino channel commented that the 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.870
 comic that comes to orgasm 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.520
 while vettel - through his video 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.620
 seemed to have reached the cattle too 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.569
 sign left two volumes of the 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:52.139
 undead né de the walking dead que 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:54.330
 she had 100 volumes 15 and 16 and did not have the 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:56.550
 serve in hand yet but I recommend 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:59.759
 The more expensive it becomes, the less I'll chew. 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.979
 You're understanding time, so like the series. 

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:03.509
 the comic he gives from ten to zero in 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:05.969
 series is total but in my opinion 

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:07.560
 so it's really amazing is one of the 

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:09.810
 The best things I've ever seen in my life. 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.699
 we also have two releases of becoming 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.650
 which should arrive in the coming months or 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:15.689
 one of them I think this month even though 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.849
 would be rep is one of those written by 

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:19.800
 great morrison and drawn instead of 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:23.550
 Roberson deals with a subject who has 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:25.379
 an imaginary friend is blue unicorn is 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:28.830
 well cool, I already read I have a version 

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:31.229
 imported is a violent hq is disgusting or 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:33.089
 in some moments all crazy 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:35.219
 so it 's really fun we also have the 

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:37.469
 release of the state by becoming live 

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:39.539
 with a video dedicated exclusively to 

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:42.029
 this series on the channel is one of the 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:44.189
 series that have been awarded the most 

00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:46.050
 years she left with a price my dear guess 

00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:48.449
 that between 50 and 60 reais 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.580
 but in fnac I have researched the 

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:52.680
 can buy about forty reais in the 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.389
 first volume is still expensive but it's okay 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.979
 less bad 

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:59.339
 Let's just say this is another release 

00:05:55.979 --> 00:06:01.520
 now the Venetian publisher is from hell 

00:05:59.339 --> 00:06:04.649
 student wall and launch a unique edition 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:08.219
 looks very thick between 400 and 500 

00:06:04.649 --> 00:06:10.259
 pages at 95 reais I think I'm mistaken 

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:12.029
 90 and a few I 've never read but I'm 

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:14.520
 very anxious to have it in her hands 

00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:16.680
 it would be speculation about the 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.210
 true motivations of jack o 

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.939
 I'm also waiting for the 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:23.159
 launch of two national hqs 

00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:24.599
 first astronaut singularity would be 

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:26.939
 probably the sequence of the national 

00:06:24.599 --> 00:06:29.580
 Stagnant, I really liked the first one. 

00:06:26.939 --> 00:06:31.349
 edition and not to mention that it is a graphic sp 

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:32.789
 and being white sp 

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:35.490
 I have to buy it is also for 

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:37.830
 go out with buggys and gustavo duarte 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:39.870
 I'm a big fan of work. 

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:41.249
 I like this comic strip so I like it 

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:44.369
 quite and I already read 

00:06:41.249 --> 00:06:47.369
 I liked the bank very well without getting 

00:06:44.369 --> 00:06:49.559
 a bit reflective and fun and has 

00:06:47.369 --> 00:06:51.419
 Fantastic architect Gustavo's art and 

00:06:49.559 --> 00:06:54.059
 if you leave the company of letters 

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:56.369
 And to finish the video, a star book. 

00:06:54.059 --> 00:06:58.769
 wars heir of the empire who is the 

00:06:56.369 --> 00:07:02.309
 first book of the ultimate trilogy 

00:06:58.769 --> 00:07:04.469
 sam is an expanded universe that is 

00:07:02.309 --> 00:07:06.959
 after the old star technology 

00:07:04.469 --> 00:07:08.909
 wars after episode 6 I would like 

00:07:06.959 --> 00:07:10.799
 hours then I'll definitely buy 

00:07:08.909 --> 00:07:12.989
 the expanded universe thing that 

00:07:10.799 --> 00:07:15.329
 I had access was that game 

00:07:12.989 --> 00:07:17.969
 it was rubbish I do not know if it was already 

00:07:15.329 --> 00:07:20.489
 played but he is the educator so the game 

00:07:17.969 --> 00:07:22.229
 looking to play for sue x 

00:07:20.489 --> 00:07:23.939
 both a point two are very good 

00:07:22.229 --> 00:07:26.159
 I know that the story of this book 

00:07:23.939 --> 00:07:28.499
 will certainly be ignored now by 

00:07:26.159 --> 00:07:30.389
 a new star wars trilogy on 

00:07:28.499 --> 00:07:32.249
 abrams but anyway I want to read 

00:07:30.389 --> 00:07:37.409
 because it is very well commented that I 

00:07:32.249 --> 00:07:39.569
 I'm good, people, I hope so. 

00:07:37.409 --> 00:07:42.239
 liked the video and click on the 

00:07:39.569 --> 00:07:44.789
 channel programs to educate the 

00:07:42.239 --> 00:07:46.559
 time than buying on the disc I 

00:07:44.789 --> 00:07:48.889
 I said something or something I did not say
