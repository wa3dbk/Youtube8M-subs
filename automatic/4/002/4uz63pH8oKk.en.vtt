00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
best way to do that is this instead of

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.920 
best way to do that is this instead of
trying<00:02:30.459> to<00:02:30.519> bending<00:02:30.849> this<00:02:30.940> whole<00:02:31.150> plate<00:02:31.480> just

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930

trying to bending this whole plate just
cut<00:02:32.230> little<00:02:32.409> Ines<00:02:32.709> enough<00:02:33.220> and<00:02:33.599> beat<00:02:34.599> the<00:02:34.750> lies

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
cut little Ines enough and beat the lies

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.759 
cut little Ines enough and beat the lies
in<00:02:36.720> take<00:02:37.720> your<00:02:37.900> time<00:02:38.110> with<00:02:38.410> it<00:02:38.440> because<00:02:38.590> you're

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
in take your time with it because you're

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 
gonna be all days hung up in this whole

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:44.699 
gonna be all days hung up in this whole
plate<00:02:40.810> over<00:02:41.280> and<00:02:42.390> actually<00:02:43.390> China<00:02:43.660> you<00:02:44.590> can

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
plate over and actually China you can

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.890 
plate over and actually China you can
get<00:02:44.830> a<00:02:44.890> sledge<00:02:45.160> humming<00:02:45.670> beat<00:02:46.030> that<00:02:46.239> up<00:02:46.450> too

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
get a sledge humming beat that up too

you could just use one of these sit that
hole<00:02:50.500> right<00:02:50.530> here<00:02:51.690> and<00:02:52.690> Jack<00:02:53.019> it<00:02:53.200> up<00:02:53.459> how<00:02:54.459> far

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
hole right here and Jack it up how far

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:01.099 
hole right here and Jack it up how far
you<00:02:54.910> needed<00:02:57.750> she<00:02:58.750> has<00:02:58.930> about<00:02:59.200> it

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:01.109 
you needed she has about it

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:04.410 
you needed she has about it
Rams<00:03:02.109> kind<00:03:02.440> of<00:03:02.530> touch<00:03:02.739> them<00:03:02.890> right<00:03:02.920> here<00:03:03.420> but

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
Rams kind of touch them right here but

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:13.280 
Rams kind of touch them right here but
it<00:03:04.540> ain't<00:03:04.750> too<00:03:04.959> much<00:03:04.989> energy<00:03:09.269> he's<00:03:10.269> over<00:03:12.120> 275

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
it ain't too much energy he's over 275

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:21.440 
it ain't too much energy he's over 275
24<00:03:16.560> you<00:03:17.560> can<00:03:17.739> check<00:03:17.950> out<00:03:18.129> my<00:03:18.280> older<00:03:19.079> videos<00:03:20.079> I

lift down some and then add the cronies
down<00:03:39.280> the<00:03:39.549> gizmo<00:03:39.880> cause<00:03:40.120> it<00:03:40.299> was<00:03:40.480> kind<00:03:40.690> of

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
down the gizmo cause it was kind of

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:48.990 
down the gizmo cause it was kind of
sticking<00:03:41.019> up<00:03:41.290> further<00:03:44.819> then<00:03:45.819> in<00:03:46.000> the<00:03:46.120> front<00:03:48.000> we
