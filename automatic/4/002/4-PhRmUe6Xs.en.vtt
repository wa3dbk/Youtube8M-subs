00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.600
 hello guys and girls that just like 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.879
 station consumer welcome to a new 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.120
 video in this case of hello 5 guardians 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.370
 specifically the multiplayer beta 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.259
 specifically the anticipated access to the 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.360
 multiplayer selling badly of me this already 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:19.170
 it's more vip and it explodes but we're going 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.820
 parts the game halo 5 will come out late 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.490
 of 2015 I think it has no specific date 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.890
 and during this December and early 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.330
 January, a beta of the 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.359
 multiplayer of solar only one 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.669
 part of the game and on top of that that goal 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.280
 which starts on the 29th, before some 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.350
 we had the possibility of having a 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.540
 early access to just one mode 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.030
 game with only two maps the beta will have 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.320
 seven maps and three game modes if not 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.180
 I'm wrong so what are you going to see what 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.739
 what are you seeing there are the first 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.739
 games my first two games of 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.719
 done in this early access to the 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.910
 beta I played you know I'm not a great 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.600
 great big fan and a great connoisseur of the 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.269
 saga but yes I played 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.829
 hello 3 and also they've said it a 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:02.570
 little bit especially hello 3 game a 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.280
 little bit more and well, more or less 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.350
 I know the mechanics I know the saga and 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.659
 I know a little bit about what is going on and how 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.270
 play so at least I can give a 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:14.450
 first impression from my knowledge 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.789
 limited but the power to have accessed 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.860
 before anyone else this part of the game 

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:21.320
 which, as I say, is in a quite phase 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.610
 early because they are after the end of 2015 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.070
 so there are still many things to change 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.619
 and in fact in the game itself you already 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.679
 they warn that my mother the aim rock 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:32.630
 they already warn you that the goal of this 

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:35.119
 beta is just that people leave their 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.250
 opinion through the channel itself 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.720
 hello channel to put the things that 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.520
 they would like to change that we do not like 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.259
 et cetera etcetera so in that sense 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.030
 it's pretty good that we're 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:45.770
 seeing here as a game of killer 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.080
 that as he left a team deathmatch 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.690
 basically a team match in the 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.580
 that which kills more wins but in the 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.429
 that there are scattered around the map 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:58.549
 super weapons sniper rifles in 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:01.100
 this case that can anyone who 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:02.990
 come you can catch them use them and they go 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.470
 regenerating little by little in this first 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.120
 departure 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.090
 I did not know very well so I dedicated myself 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.860
 just to kill as much as I could 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.170
 is very good head shot rock very 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.750
 good very good 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.720
 my impression is that this good game 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.160
 because it respects the essence of the saga 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.300
 shots to the body and to be able to put those 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.280
 want in the end what kills is the 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.160
 head shot or melee 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:28.670
 arm that double good if you give two you kill 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:31.580
 in mobility, it's also good, 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.140
 nexus is an exoskeleton that makes 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.700
 years was a novelty really 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.080
 important in the world of the sures 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.730
 now with the 'bund' work fer 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.800
 they contact folk because it is less noticeable 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.140
 but it's still interesting the super 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.150
 jumps and the small propulsive backpack 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.819
 what do you wear that allows you 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.310
 move in quickly to the right 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:51.560
 to the left and even to the top 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.239
 to have votes to dodge or exit 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.090
 of situations of danger equal to 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:58.489
 happened in the other games or there we have 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.739
 the sniper rifle and he's left alone 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:03.590
 two losses you imagine I can finish 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:05.989
 heading me with a shot there from 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.120
 sniper killing a direct shot at 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.590
 the head like last low you imagine 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.290
 because the beating we put on the 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.090
 blue we 'll let you go there come only remains 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.250
 a low we're going rock we 're going rock we 're going 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.810
 rotating for your subs do it for your channel 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.830
 do it for the people who have endured 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.400
 these 3 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:25.040
 17 18 19 20 seconds watching the video 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.260
 we go route you can where there is up 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.030
 up above I turn around to give the 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.330
 back we go before they kill him we go 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:35.010
 that you have epic music there 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:37.620
 but you'll see more of frank rifles than 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.960
 they pass league and to see is more terrible the 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.720
 sniper in the next game by 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:45.450
 true the ptar with don this was very very 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.770
 very very good this guy really and in 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.960
 this game that you are going to see now that is 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:51.090
 the second one is going to play against me but 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.280
 I still got it good, it came out pretty 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.200
 well stopped you will see it to be my 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.790
 first parts then he said he follows 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.280
 being a good game in this case of 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.020
 4 against 4 is very tactical in the sense 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.370
 that if you have the superiority if you read 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:05.040
 two against one you will win sure 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.170
 attention to and attention to the rifle attention 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.930
 the rifle kills someone rock looks at that 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.970
 is still standing still are seeing 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:13.560
 there were people I do not know how not playing many 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.620
 sometimes you found someone to dominate 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:19.560
 this summer do not jump no no no road no 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.700
 that maimed you are here it can be said that 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.200
 although I had to wait a little bit 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.210
 attention to double low he killed one and 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.060
 he killed the other one of double low and careful and 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.320
 although I had to wait quite a while 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.990
 principle pretty to say to the best 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.030
 five or six minutes to play I 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.740
 I started playing the second day of the beta 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.400
 we go nudge and we have the 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:40.290
 head first of all 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.290
 there were enough people late 

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:45.949
 and as from the heart, it cost me 

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:48.050
 principle the first five minutes do not 

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:49.699
 against the game but then restart and 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.610
 the truth is that it was quite simple 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:54.319
 to enter to get game play 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.419
 despite the fact that there were few people and 

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:58.309
 everybody nothing about the supposed actor and 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:00.069
 by the way game I'm playing on xbox 

00:04:58.309 --> 00:05:02.119
 band from party that had not said 

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:04.759
 attention here you see how it is 

00:05:02.119 --> 00:05:06.349
 regenerating there the shots to the body as 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:07.490
 the rifle is being regenerated 

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:08.599
 sniper and therefore is not 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.809
 protesting nothing 

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:12.889
 adapt, condom, just killing me 

00:05:10.809 --> 00:05:15.409
 So, it gives me the feeling that 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:18.919
 Respect that tactical game a little bit 

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:20.599
 although it is true we are going it is 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:22.699
 true that maybe a little more 

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:23.959
 dynamic from what I remember that what 3 

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:26.270
 and in fact there are people who have complained 

00:05:23.959 --> 00:05:27.889
 not to say is that every time it looks 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.990
 more to call of duty and I honestly do not 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:32.029
 I have had that feeling for my own 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:33.860
 mechanics of the game and for what it costs 

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:34.969
 more to kill someone no no is not easy 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.439
 kill someone is shot at the 

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:39.080
 head in that sense reminds me 

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:40.669
 also a little bit to counter strike that 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.860
 the other day in an event I played because 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:44.659
 once to count is so good as 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.009
 you see my opinion is not based on the 

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:47.569
 super knowledge that I have that 

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:49.339
 be a super expert but what 

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:51.379
 some of you can identify 

00:05:49.339 --> 00:05:53.659
 with me if you just want to know 

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:55.309
 something more halo or you want to be 

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:57.619
 asking if you want to play halo or 

00:05:55.309 --> 00:05:58.939
 not if this is a room that interests you 

00:05:57.619 --> 00:06:00.949
 If this new edition is going to like us 

00:05:58.939 --> 00:06:02.089
 etcetera, not in that sense, maybe you 

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:03.889
 may interest this video I hope that 

00:06:02.089 --> 00:06:05.869
 so be it and also, as always, a 

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:08.029
 early access an early access I think 

00:06:05.869 --> 00:06:09.469
 which is I would say that even our 

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:11.389
 responsibility as u2 see if we can 

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:13.159
 have access to a game first of all 

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:14.629
 before anyone can upload a video 

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:16.759
 teaching what so that whoever has 

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:18.589
 curiosity then I can see it I do not know 

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:19.849
 specifically the conditions for 

00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:22.339
 access the beta I think it has 

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:24.319
 reserved the game you can access 

00:06:22.339 --> 00:06:26.089
 to the beta but I do not know if there are more options 

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:27.770
 to get it and you see it a shot to the 

00:06:26.089 --> 00:06:28.999
 head and killed him though the shots 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:31.669
 in the body just the previous play 

00:06:28.999 --> 00:06:32.719
 you have seen that it costs a lot but good 

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:34.430
 well, I hope you liked it 

00:06:32.719 --> 00:06:37.369
 when the beta is open to the public 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:39.019
 and there are more maps and everything 

00:06:37.369 --> 00:06:40.279
 I will surely try to upload another video 

00:06:39.019 --> 00:06:41.869
 to show you some more thing and I 

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:43.069
 I would like to even play with someone with 

00:06:41.869 --> 00:06:44.930
 chivas or if you do not have someone who 

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:46.789
 have hello that knows a little more than 

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:48.259
 me and can teach me in the end I hope that 

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:49.969
 I liked that you served 

00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:52.879
 video is already the next by the way two 

00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:53.660
 victories and the two positive games 

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:55.430
 my mother 

00:06:53.660 --> 00:07:00.460
 who has seen you and who fears what happens 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:07:00.460
 black up something goodbye guys
