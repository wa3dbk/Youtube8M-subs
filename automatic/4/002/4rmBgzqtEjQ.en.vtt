00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.720
 hello everyone welcome a video more than 

00:00:01.859 --> 00:00:06.690
 new to my channel today I bring you a video 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.719
 people because it had been a long time since 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.669
 easy video and I do not know if you remember that the 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.659
 last summer a boom of smoothies 

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:18.900
 green these that carry the famous 

00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:22.109
 who decided to make the videos about the 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.179
 shakes smoothies bines I will do 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.820
 three that are the most typical the green 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:29.220
 red and orange so by colors is already 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.660
 truthfully contradicts the ingredients and 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.580
 I have to say that I did not try them 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.630
 before because I got the feeling that 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:39.630
 they will be very bad with that color I said 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.790
 no no but they are not super rich and also 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:45.030
 is that I thought we were going in salty 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.510
 but so sweet so I have 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.510
 operated 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.010
 I also have to tell you that no 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:55.399
 they replace a meal, I'm good 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:57.110
 take mid-morning or mid-afternoon as 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:58.670
 for snack has a lot of 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:02.089
 vitamin is good is in his people 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:04.850
 so since we 're going to ask more, I'm going to 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:07.460
 start with the first one that is my 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.560
 favorite the green smoothie to my 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.149
 symptoms I like I do not know why and it's 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.149
 good for a lot of things because it's 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:15.950
 weight loss fat burning 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:17.750
 fluid retention and plenty of 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.990
 vitamins is a way to eat vegetables 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.940
 you will always feel good that I believe that 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.690
 they are the complete ones and I am going to teach you 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:29.090
 what it takes for this we are going to need the 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.289
 juice of half a lemon a pear a cucumber 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.929
 of these are a half cucumber of the 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:35.330
 large a handful of mint does not 

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:38.000
 the need is as great as I am 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.310
 I love it and lynn a lot a little handful 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.630
 of spinach and a glass of water now 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.119
 you just have to put all the 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:47.740
 blender or blender and then if 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.740
 you want you can pass it through a colander 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.570
 I recommend that you take it in 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:58.189
 followed or that you remove it before 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.590
 take it if you are not going to take it in the 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:06.109
 the second moment that I am going to teach you 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:08.780
 This is usually reddish purple 

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:11.209
 bring beets and then you see their 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.420
 variations depends on what you put 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:18.170
 obviously this above all is good for 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:20.780
 the digestive processes you already 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.290
 understand is poured and told me super 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.060
 all right 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.130
 it is perfectly understood what I said 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.319
 very fine and also good for the 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.900
 fluid retention and also in 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:32.959
 santiago more for the smoothie of color 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.930
 reddish or pink we're going to need a 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.549
 beet a pear 50 grams of pineapple 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.440
 although I put a little more to 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:41.720
 times when I want it to be sweeter and 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.209
 a pinch of ginger we put everything in 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.220
 the blender or the blender and then 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.799
 you go through the colander and you must have 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.380
 remained something such that so by the way if 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:53.420
 you like the boats are from home 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.400
 and the third of the smoothies is the 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.430
 orange that as you may have guessed 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.860
 already carries mostly carrots 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.980
 It tastes very sweet to me I really like this 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.710
 also and it's special for then for the 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.470
 face 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:11.450
 I say you have less 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.820
 I do not know how I do not have much for 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.200
 neither did it make a big difference what 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.850
 yeah well I notice is that when I 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.190
 I take several times a week 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:22.610
 I have beats as more more luminous I would see 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.410
 more so I show you what it takes and now 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.270
 this make shake that is the green of the 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.330
 green because already a lot of vegetables 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:31.760
 you need a handful of romaine lettuce 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:33.440
 a handful of spinach half an apple 5 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.260
 carrots that is elevated the color 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.720
 orange and a cucumber you put everything to the 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.550
 blender and this one already that a 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.430
 shake for two people because it comes out 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:47.300
 quite a lot and look has the 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:48.800
 naranjita stays and you have it ready 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.080
 Well I hope you liked it 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:56.220
 many more obviously to do but 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:58.140
 these are the ones that I normally take and 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.490
