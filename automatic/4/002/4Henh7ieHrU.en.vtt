00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
in his speech at the same time bit like

in his speech at the same time bit like
a<00:00:44.370> puffin<00:00:49.670> I<00:00:54.079> don't<00:00:55.079> think<00:00:55.320> he<00:00:55.440> could<00:00:55.680> because

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
a puffin I don't think he could because

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.939 
a puffin I don't think he could because
black<00:00:56.879> birds<00:00:57.149> beak<00:00:57.420> is<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.780> bit<00:00:58.170> stronger<00:00:58.530> than

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
black birds beak is a bit stronger than

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.959 
black birds beak is a bit stronger than
the<00:00:59.070> little<00:00:59.250> birds<00:00:59.520> beak<00:00:59.969> so<00:01:00.660> if<00:01:00.809> he<00:01:01.670> if<00:01:02.670> he

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
the little birds beak so if he if he

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.230 
the little birds beak so if he if he
really<00:01:03.420> closes<00:01:04.019> his<00:01:04.320> what<00:01:04.589> you<00:01:04.799> call

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:05.240 
really closes his what you call

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.520 
really closes his what you call
mandibles<00:01:06.240> that's<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.720> top<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.049> bottom<00:01:07.170> bit

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
mandibles that's the top and bottom bit

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.539 
mandibles that's the top and bottom bit
on<00:01:08.100> two<00:01:08.580> mealworms<00:01:09.770> the<00:01:10.770> dried<00:01:11.040> ones<00:01:11.340> are

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
on two mealworms the dried ones are

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.520 
on two mealworms the dried ones are
probably<00:01:11.670> just<00:01:12.090> breaking<00:01:12.330> off<00:01:12.659> that's<00:01:13.320> my

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
probably just breaking off that's my

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.220 
probably just breaking off that's my
theory

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:17.230 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:24.149 

Oh

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:28.039 

I<00:01:24.219> could<00:01:25.090> sit<00:01:25.450> and<00:01:25.479> watch<00:01:25.840> this<00:01:26.350> sort<00:01:26.649> of<00:01:26.770> thing

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
I could sit and watch this sort of thing

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:34.130 
I could sit and watch this sort of thing
for<00:01:29.049> ages<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:32.500> in<00:01:32.619> fact<00:01:32.799> I<00:01:32.979> do

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
of mealworms in its mouth I found I

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.249 
of mealworms in its mouth I found I
found<00:02:03.310> a<00:02:03.640> few<00:02:03.849> black<00:02:04.209> bird<00:02:04.450> feathers<00:02:04.989> the

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
found a few black bird feathers the

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:10.169 
found a few black bird feathers the
other<00:02:05.379> day<00:02:05.649> I<00:02:06.569> know<00:02:07.569> around<00:02:08.049> here<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:10.000> I

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
other day I know around here and I

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.600 
other day I know around here and I
thought<00:02:10.390> maybe<00:02:10.690> something<00:02:11.260> that<00:02:11.290> got<00:02:11.560> it<00:02:11.739> was

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
thought maybe something that got it was

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:25.039 
thought maybe something that got it was
it<00:02:12.760> a<00:02:12.790> cat<00:02:13.269> or<00:02:13.540> a<00:02:13.569> fox<00:02:15.030> but<00:02:22.709> missing<00:02:23.709> feathers

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
it a cat or a fox but missing feathers

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:30.420 
it a cat or a fox but missing feathers
actually<00:02:26.049> being<00:02:27.209> killed<00:02:28.290> so<00:02:29.290> I<00:02:30.190> think<00:02:30.250> he

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
actually being killed so I think he

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.220 
actually being killed so I think he
might<00:02:30.609> have<00:02:30.700> got<00:02:30.819> away<00:02:30.910> with<00:02:31.030> it<00:02:31.299> this<00:02:31.480> he's

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
might have got away with it this he's

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.650 
might have got away with it this he's
got<00:02:32.440> a<00:02:32.500> slightly<00:02:32.859> tatty<00:02:33.370> tail<00:02:33.819> and<00:02:34.269> you<00:02:34.480> can

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
got a slightly tatty tail and you can

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.809 
got a slightly tatty tail and you can
most<00:02:35.349> birds<00:02:35.650> can<00:02:35.920> lose<00:02:36.099> a<00:02:36.130> few<00:02:36.430> feathers

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
most birds can lose a few feathers

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.220 
most birds can lose a few feathers
without<00:02:37.150> much<00:02:37.389> damage<00:02:38.370> it's<00:02:39.370> not<00:02:39.579> like<00:02:40.230> some

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
without much damage it's not like some

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:47.890 
without much damage it's not like some
lizards<00:02:41.709> which<00:02:42.040> leave<00:02:42.310> their<00:02:42.519> tail<00:02:42.730> behind
