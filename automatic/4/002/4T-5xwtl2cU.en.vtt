00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.899
 hello all that still did not admit moment it's just been pointed so 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.350
 usual as fundamentally in taking our dog for a walk 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:08.949
 if it feels sexy 

00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:11.949
 it seems easy but here we last may 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:27.019
 If you want to enjoy a pleasant walk with your dog the last 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:29.970
 what do you have to do when entities follow him 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.850
 because you have to know that he interpreted that pulling advanced 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.489
 So those who know how to do what I'm doing right now are metal 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:39.489
 white and let the director 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.100
 when he is worth the thousands of people of all that history advances is this 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.380
 way to understand what not 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.350
 you have to pull and above all very important do not hit strong pylons 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.350
 because it can cause very serious injuries in the neck 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.530
 by the replicas more so that something as usual as walking our dog is 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.350
 become a playable experience 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.220
 You can take the dog in the left hand because 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.520
 very simple because that's how it was that it was the right hand to say hello to a 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.410
 friend or a neighbor to take the purchase or to do something as simple as 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.610
 open a door that yes as long as it is and parties in the event that 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.120
 six strings scales on the opposite side 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.600
 and is that it was defined 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.600
 we are far away 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.020
 and he came out this afternoon he meets another 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.700
 It's very easy to never pull the leash because your dog 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.210
 relate to that pull with the other dog and you will not like it right away 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.630
 then the best thing that yesterday is to let them relate and if on top we are in a 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.380
 site where they do not bother we can let go we let go and they play 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.380
 chance 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.230
 and to finish something very important, do not ever give him your forgiveness 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.369
 strangled out of punishment like this 

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:15.359
 because it's been many, many years, no matter how big he is but it does not matter 

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:17.409
 look at the military, you do not need it 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:20.379
 we would like harassment to put truth to them either
