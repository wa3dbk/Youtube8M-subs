00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:05.790
 it was seventy seventh year it seems from 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:08.370
 I'm not mistaken, I studied in the seventh grade you 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.259
 I decided to change the school immediately on September 1 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.780
 met porridge our parents knew a friend 

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:14.610
 friend before that they also worked together 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.039
 there were some common scientific interests 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.500
 they were engaged in both geology and geophysics 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.029
 in Kazakhstan they wrote a joint article on 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.230
 we didn't know each other he was the most 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.590
 small may not be the smallest 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.330
 in class but one of these little ones 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.890
 because he immediately became friends or 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.610
 one desk and four years together 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.740
 sat we had a desk of medalists we 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.620
 very successfully disaccustomed with arkashe we 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:41.490
 finished with gold medals and we went 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.890
 naturally in the corners we didn't know what was going 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.960
 ideological war which concerns 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.000
 we did not guess we knew that she 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.810
 Goes we thought that this not applies to 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.520
 the privacy of schoolchildren from smears we 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:58.200
 then they didn’t know much that we were Jews 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:00.510
 surnames such that you can do but it 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:04.440
 turned out to be fatal Muscovites were not 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.300
 better aware of the matter in mother 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.190
 somehow it was not very popular 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.310
 Information here and Moscow with 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:15.530
 university showed itself in all its glory 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.550
 they didn’t accept us brilliantly 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.200
 compliance with legal genres of this 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.760
 ideological fight which then 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.640
 happened that is it was not 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.960
 objective reasons not because we 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.080
 poorly knew math 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:32.310
 I think that the rector omgu so sleep on 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:35.040
 nights bite your elbows to 1 search appeared 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.050
 somewhere in the ninetieth year our Russian 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.020
 search at a time when I was faced with 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.880
 this is not trampling absolutely not interesting 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:45.270
 so we really found out right away that 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.010
 it's not trivial because there are many 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.890
 questions of such 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.900
 they are largely scientific there 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.840
 how to code it correctly 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:57.060
 that's right how to arrange the search itself 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.190
 it's a lot of my science but then when i 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.930
 I started it seemed boring 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.400
 programming is like breaking in less 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.549
 bored than any other tasks but 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:08.310
 just my friend he had company 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.720
 Here I actually did 98 ninth year 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.470
 and I came to them ninety said 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.900
 come on 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.620
 I'm a little Popish I had a 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.820
 notebook 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.770
 we brought in all sorts of bugs to 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.230
 the program was the best in the world 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.210
 it was an international directory 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.360
 classification of inventions such a product 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:29.220
 for patent species now called 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.340
 international patent and classification 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.840
 mixing up seven volumes of such or 9 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.430
 which we managed to shove there in 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.130
 very small amount of floppy very 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.600
 tightly squeezed packed organized there 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.490
 the correct search index of this 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.750
 worked almost on their screed some 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.610
 The moment I connected was already programming 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.120
 first took one small task then 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.030
 another 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:51.030
 who wrote the installer there Dima videos 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.890
 something else and so stretched involved all 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.870
 rewrote there gradually then came 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.980
 a certain collapse the Soviet Union ended and 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.630
 Tintoretto stopped buying 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.860
 program and we realized that we need to change 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.880
 shell change everything go there on 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:08.640
 windows for the last money bought 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:11.340
 licensed and dictionary means Russian 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.930
 good new language and do new 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.709
 the core is that there was a new search a lot 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.989
 indexing 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.430
 more compact and fast before that we 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.050
 everything was very complicated 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.340
 it was necessary to prepare the text 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.930
 it was impossible to do anything on the fly 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.190
 was add text and get right away 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.620
 it was necessary to search it 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.750
 offline user could not do everything 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.150
 do it and it turned out so very 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.980
 good technology that i showed 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.390
 arkashi love everything fit in memory there 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.870
 whole dictionary let's think of a name 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:39.239
 and that's about then it was gum 93 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.040
 years and somehow from the nights sat and 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:43.170
 came up with a name specifically there often 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.640
 failed list of fifteen 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:48.630
 the titles came first 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.019
 yandex because from the index it was possible 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.510
 to make 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:53.220
 Russian word of research was impossible 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.920
 make you talk about this i played 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.450
 scrapping index came up gender showed 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.060
 arkashi and tarkashi let's do it 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.650
 first corncob 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:05.910
 it looked so fresh 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.480
 fashionable and we decided that ok let's play 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.160
 in this game 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.440
 decided to make the first Russian letter 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.440
 the rest are Latin we are at the beginning on 4 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.300
 years made a presentation called people in 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.970
 including 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.880
 from biblical society still from somewhere else 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.049
 there and it was very writing it beautiful 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.240
 because under windows then it was not enough 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.920
 programs western system remember 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:29.870
 there were who were looking for the bible 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:31.760
 there was quite a lot that's why we took 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.400
 this one is only a model such thing 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:37.610
 which well declares us as a company 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.320
 who exists who knows how 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.730
 it is good to search for Russian texts 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.970
 qualitatively and this y calculation turned out to be 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:45.200
 absolutely true because we sort of 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.550
 one side started selling it 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:48.170
 of course did not bring any income 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.990
 absolutely this non-commercial stuff such 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:52.880
 but but nasa noticed there let's say 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:55.630
 structures that were engaged in 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.200
 preparation of major electrode publications 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.880
 state there paypal 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.650
 state and at that moment 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.750
 indeed we had such a very 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.670
 decent technology with very decent 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.050
 interface we are just for this this 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:09.050
 connected to the internet at ninety 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:11.480
 For the fifth year, we suddenly realized that 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.830
 humanity needs to look good that is 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.810
 before that was not very human and need 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.850
 to look at all we have to do this already 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:19.340
 new system is essentially rewriting it 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:21.550
 which could work open 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:24.230
 vocabulary completely with any words 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:26.600
 before that, all search engines worked 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:28.760
 on the dictionary which 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:31.190
 known the system needed him 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:33.020
 prepare and with him by the way 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:34.160
 it was necessary to index the text here 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.820
 bypass an infinite amount 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:40.250
 endless texts written by all 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:41.480
 newspeak there names anything for 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:43.400
 it needed to be able to handle 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:47.510
 morphologically all words are not only those 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:48.800
 who described 5 great linguists here 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.660
 for this we had to redo everything and 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.040
 system remake and so here is Yandex 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.050
 he is just with us in the summer of six 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:56.810
 of the year was announced there in September 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:58.510
 it was announced as a system 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:00.980
 which allows any text 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:03.500
 process to look for morphologies quickly 

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:05.510
 easy to make endless search 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:08.870
 on the endless internet it was necessary yet 

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:11.420
 work and we did half a year like this 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.980
 system by the summer of '97 I only 

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:15.530
 prepared which allows you to search 

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:17.370
 In general, on any set of documents but 

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:19.830
 and how to walk 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:21.570
 internet dynamic this was the launch 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:23.880
 of what is called yandex.ru 

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:26.669
 that i naked existed yandex.ru 

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:28.020
 whole year we were as this was generally 

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:29.970
 communism was such a feeling that 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:31.250
 Internet is not about money at all 

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:37.500
 community 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:40.919
 such intelligent ironic sharply 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:44.280
 thinking intellectuals such a business 

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:45.810
 started in the 98th and the keen sense that 

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:47.639
 serious business she arose only 

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:51.419
 ninety- ninth at the same time no one 

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:53.669
 understood where the money will come from but 

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:55.800
 the market ran some kind of limp 

00:06:53.669 --> 00:06:57.979
 investors and said that you do not understand 

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:00.960
 you are standing there many millions of dollars 

00:06:57.979 --> 00:07:03.330
 immediately means doing serious 

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:06.539
 deed means incra parry do 

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:11.210
 portal and so on but we had to 

00:07:06.539 --> 00:07:11.210
 so what to do
