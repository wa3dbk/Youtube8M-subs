00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
beans yay now have cocoa beans and the

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.830 
beans yay now have cocoa beans and the
cocoa<00:00:26.369> bean<00:00:26.490> texture<00:00:27.090> has<00:00:27.300> been<00:00:27.420> changed<00:00:27.810> to

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
cocoa bean texture has been changed to

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.089 
cocoa bean texture has been changed to
look<00:00:28.140> a<00:00:28.410> lot<00:00:29.039> better<00:00:29.250> more<00:00:29.699> like<00:00:29.880> cocoa<00:00:30.269> beans

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099 
look a lot better more like cocoa beans

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:37.940 
look a lot better more like cocoa beans
yeah<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:34.670> that<00:00:35.670> is<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.090> first<00:00:36.360> stage<00:00:36.690> that<00:00:37.649> is

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
yeah and that is the first stage that is

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.030 
yeah and that is the first stage that is
the<00:00:38.100> final<00:00:38.489> stage<00:00:39.050> it<00:00:40.050> doesn't<00:00:40.440> take<00:00:40.559> time<00:00:40.860> to

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
the final stage it doesn't take time to

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.549 
the final stage it doesn't take time to
break<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.399> final<00:00:41.850> stage<00:00:42.300> but<00:00:42.629> just<00:00:43.200> a<00:00:43.290> very

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
break the final stage but just a very

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.850 
break the final stage but just a very
tiny<00:00:43.829> bit<00:00:44.190> first<00:00:44.969> stage<00:00:45.300> takes<00:00:46.170> time<00:00:46.469> as<00:00:46.649> well

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
tiny bit first stage takes time as well

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.080 
tiny bit first stage takes time as well
these<00:00:47.550> things<00:00:47.820> glow<00:00:48.270> instead<00:00:48.870> of<00:00:49.020> like<00:00:49.350> and

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
these things glow instead of like and

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.750 
these things glow instead of like and
they<00:00:51.090> show<00:00:51.420> off<00:00:51.649> breaking<00:00:52.649> texture<00:00:53.250> but<00:00:53.489> um

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
they show off breaking texture but um

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.069 
they show off breaking texture but um
they<00:00:54.629> glow<00:00:55.140> when<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:55.469> break<00:00:55.800> them<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:57.079> these

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
they glow when you break them and these

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.430 
they glow when you break them and these
things<00:00:58.260> have<00:00:58.410> hit<00:00:58.739> boxes<00:00:59.219> so<00:00:59.930> let<00:01:00.930> me<00:01:01.050> just<00:01:01.230> get

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
things have hit boxes so let me just get

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:08.660 
things have hit boxes so let me just get
up<00:01:01.649> here

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.280 

my<00:01:09.210> mouse<00:01:09.450> is<00:01:09.479> freaking<00:01:10.049> out<00:01:10.229> uh<00:01:12.020> yeah<00:01:13.020> these

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
my mouse is freaking out uh yeah these

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:23.290 
my mouse is freaking out uh yeah these
things<00:01:13.770> oh<00:01:14.070> my<00:01:15.060> god<00:01:16.220> have<00:01:17.220> hit<00:01:17.490> boxes<00:01:19.310> now

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:23.300 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.470 

so<00:01:23.960> now<00:01:24.410> that<00:01:24.440> can<00:01:24.800> be<00:01:24.920> used<00:01:25.130> in<00:01:25.480> adventure

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:26.480 
so now that can be used in adventure

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.690 
so now that can be used in adventure
maps<00:01:27.910> very<00:01:28.910> nicely<00:01:30.370> instead<00:01:31.370> of<00:01:31.400> using

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
maps very nicely instead of using

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.300 
maps very nicely instead of using
ladders<00:01:32.240> or<00:01:32.720> something<00:01:34.780> and<00:01:35.780> you<00:01:36.710> can<00:01:36.950> press

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
ladders or something and you can press

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.830 
ladders or something and you can press
shift<00:01:37.670> on<00:01:37.880> them<00:01:38.060> so<00:01:38.900> let<00:01:39.140> me<00:01:39.380> go<00:01:39.740> back<00:01:40.840> there

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
shift on them so let me go back there

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.730 
shift on them so let me go back there
and<00:01:42.850> show<00:01:43.850> off<00:01:43.970> this<00:01:44.180> when<00:01:45.110> you're<00:01:45.260> shifting

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
and show off this when you're shifting

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.650 
and show off this when you're shifting
you<00:01:46.220> might<00:01:46.430> expect<00:01:46.760> to<00:01:46.940> stay<00:01:47.210> on<00:01:47.330> the<00:01:47.450> block

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:47.660 
you might expect to stay on the block

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.890 
you might expect to stay on the block
but<00:01:47.900> you<00:01:48.110> actually<00:01:48.290> fall<00:01:48.800> onto<00:01:49.070> that<00:01:49.400> and<00:01:49.900> just

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:50.900 
but you actually fall onto that and just

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.540 
but you actually fall onto that and just
go<00:01:51.140> on<00:01:51.290> that<00:01:51.530> you<00:01:51.890> can<00:01:52.070> stay<00:01:52.700> on<00:01:52.730> it<00:01:54.220> and<00:01:55.220> these

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
go on that you can stay on it and these

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:01.500 
go on that you can stay on it and these
things<00:01:55.850> kangra<00:01:56.480> on<00:01:56.600> the<00:01:56.780> dark<00:01:57.020> but<00:01:58.540> and<00:01:59.800> light

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.510 
things kangra on the dark but and light

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:12.990 
things kangra on the dark but and light
light<00:02:02.510> is<00:02:02.720> probably<00:02:03.050> better<00:02:03.320> and

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.940 

um

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.479 

anything<00:02:16.879> past<00:02:17.379> there's<00:02:18.379> four<00:02:18.739> stages<00:02:19.040> in<00:02:19.400> the

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
anything past there's four stages in the

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.900 
anything past there's four stages in the
cocoa<00:02:19.819> bean<00:02:19.849> right<00:02:20.840> and<00:02:21.340> anything<00:02:22.340> passed<00:02:22.760> the

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
cocoa bean right and anything passed the

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.199 
cocoa bean right and anything passed the
first<00:02:23.090> stage<00:02:23.269> you<00:02:23.599> can't<00:02:23.840> go<00:02:23.989> past<00:02:24.670> well<00:02:25.670> or

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
first stage you can't go past well or

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.050 
first stage you can't go past well or
you<00:02:26.269> have<00:02:26.540> to<00:02:26.690> like<00:02:26.840> jump<00:02:27.110> over<00:02:27.580> or<00:02:28.580> something

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
you have to like jump over or something

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.089 
you have to like jump over or something
see<00:02:29.989> dislike<00:02:30.920> I<00:02:31.160> hit<00:02:31.370> my<00:02:31.519> head<00:02:31.550> on<00:02:31.760> this<00:02:32.060> one

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099 
see dislike I hit my head on this one

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:36.210 
see dislike I hit my head on this one
but<00:02:34.099> these<00:02:34.459> first<00:02:35.150> ones<00:02:35.390> I<00:02:35.599> can<00:02:35.660> go<00:02:35.930> right<00:02:36.170> past

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
but these first ones I can go right past

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.740 
but these first ones I can go right past
but<00:02:37.220> I<00:02:37.400> can't<00:02:37.849> go<00:02:38.030> between<00:02:38.480> them<00:02:38.739> so<00:02:40.510> now<00:02:41.510> this

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
but I can't go between them so now this

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:48.220 
but I can't go between them so now this
basically<00:02:42.319> renewable<00:02:43.069> source<00:02:43.340> ova<00:02:43.819> of<00:02:47.230> of

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
basically renewable source ova of of

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.960 
basically renewable source ova of of
cocoa<00:02:49.130> beans<00:02:49.340> I<00:02:49.670> know<00:02:50.569> that's<00:02:50.900> annoying<00:02:51.230> you

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
cocoa beans I know that's annoying you

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.630 
cocoa beans I know that's annoying you
so<00:02:52.970> yeah<00:02:53.360> there's<00:02:53.599> four<00:02:53.810> stages<00:02:54.140> um<00:02:54.650> that's

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
so yeah there's four stages um that's

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.559 
so yeah there's four stages um that's
stage<00:02:56.209> one<00:02:56.290> that's<00:02:57.400> yeah<00:02:58.400> yeah<00:02:58.730> and<00:02:58.910> these<00:02:59.269> can

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
stage one that's yeah yeah and these can

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:02.319 
stage one that's yeah yeah and these can
be<00:02:59.840> used<00:03:00.110> with<00:03:00.290> bone<00:03:00.590> meal<00:03:00.829> to<00:03:01.670> go<00:03:01.849> straight<00:03:02.180> to

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:02.329 
be used with bone meal to go straight to

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:08.650 
be used with bone meal to go straight to
stage<00:03:02.930> for<00:03:04.000> this<00:03:05.000> stage<00:03:05.360> one<00:03:07.239> let<00:03:08.239> me<00:03:08.360> front

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
stage for this stage one let me front

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:15.490 
stage for this stage one let me front
stitch<00:03:08.959> to

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.810 

or<00:03:15.590> maybe<00:03:16.370> just<00:03:16.520> three<00:03:17.180> stages<00:03:18.160> but<00:03:19.160> I<00:03:19.370> think

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
or maybe just three stages but I think

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.260 
or maybe just three stages but I think
it's<00:03:20.000> for<00:03:20.300> don't<00:03:20.900> quote<00:03:21.140> me<00:03:21.380> on<00:03:21.410> that<00:03:22.270> because

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.270 
it's for don't quote me on that because

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:28.900 
it's for don't quote me on that because
I'm<00:03:23.450> not<00:03:23.660> sure<00:03:23.990> and<00:03:25.660> so<00:03:26.770> yeah<00:03:27.770> it's<00:03:28.190> cool<00:03:28.580> and

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
I'm not sure and so yeah it's cool and

can<00:03:39.290> be<00:03:39.470> moved<00:03:39.740> with<00:03:39.950> pistons

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:52.110 

here<00:03:45.260> we<00:03:45.379> go

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.780 

and<00:03:52.450> even<00:03:52.989> if<00:03:53.110> you<00:03:53.230> have<00:03:53.349> a<00:03:53.379> small<00:03:54.069> one<00:03:54.340> they

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
and even if you have a small one they

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.500 
and even if you have a small one they
always<00:03:54.970> drop<00:03:55.330> at<00:03:55.540> least<00:03:55.780> one<00:03:56.110> and<00:03:57.299> the<00:03:58.299> big

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
ones the big cocoa beans those drop more

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.350 
ones the big cocoa beans those drop more
than<00:04:03.250> 10<00:04:03.940> it's<00:04:04.780> basically<00:04:05.400> basically<00:04:06.400> also<00:04:07.330> uh

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
than 10 it's basically basically also uh

but you can't find these things in a in

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:30.110 
but you can't find these things in a in
a<00:04:17.579> jungle<00:04:18.579> bomb<00:04:18.900> so<00:04:20.310> just<00:04:21.310> on<00:04:21.519> trees<00:04:23.130> on

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:37.040 

we'll<00:04:31.120> just<00:04:31.600> work<00:04:32.520> on<00:04:33.520> these<00:04:34.420> types<00:04:34.720> of<00:04:34.870> trees

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
we'll just work on these types of trees

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.480 
we'll just work on these types of trees
on<00:04:38.050> those<00:04:38.320> types<00:04:38.560> of<00:04:38.680> trees<00:04:38.920> you<00:04:39.070> just<00:04:39.310> find

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
on those types of trees you just find

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:48.080 
on those types of trees you just find
them<00:04:39.610> like<00:04:39.790> that<00:04:40.650> at<00:04:41.650> different<00:04:42.610> stages<00:04:45.060> so
