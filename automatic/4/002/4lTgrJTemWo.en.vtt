it's gonna be very competitive
I<00:00:10.530> think<00:00:10.710> Rogers<00:00:11.070> got<00:00:11.190> a<00:00:11.250> little<00:00:11.550> too<00:00:11.700> much

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
I think Rogers got a little too much

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.430 
I think Rogers got a little too much
right<00:00:11.910> now<00:00:12.150> his<00:00:12.450> form<00:00:12.780> is<00:00:12.990> that<00:00:13.019> much<00:00:13.259> better

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
right now his form is that much better

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.900 
right now his form is that much better
Marty<00:00:13.830> who's<00:00:13.950> played<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:14.250> fewest<00:00:14.580> number<00:00:14.700> of

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
Marty who's played the fewest number of

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.910 
Marty who's played the fewest number of
matches<00:00:15.299> of<00:00:15.420> anyone<00:00:15.839> in<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.049> top<00:00:16.289> 20<00:00:16.680> so<00:00:16.890> I

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
matches of anyone in the top 20 so I

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.500 
matches of anyone in the top 20 so I
think<00:00:17.039> Rogers<00:00:17.609> got<00:00:17.760> a<00:00:17.820> little<00:00:18.330> more
