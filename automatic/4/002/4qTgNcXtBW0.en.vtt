I'll take care of and we're gonna see

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.349 
I'll take care of and we're gonna see
how<00:00:36.670> many<00:00:36.730> will<00:00:37.090> fit<00:00:37.270> in<00:00:37.360> the<00:00:37.420> house<00:00:37.600> so<00:00:39.359> we're

00:00:40.349 --> 00:00:40.359 
how many will fit in the house so we're

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:43.500 
how many will fit in the house so we're
using<00:00:40.510> the<00:00:40.780> single<00:00:41.620> chamber<00:00:41.910> DIY<00:00:42.910> kit<00:00:43.210> that<00:00:43.420> I

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
using the single chamber DIY kit that I

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.150 
using the single chamber DIY kit that I
converted<00:00:43.989> into<00:00:44.109> a<00:00:44.230> three<00:00:44.500> chamber<00:00:44.890> but<00:00:45.070> I'm

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
converted into a three chamber but I'm

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.040 
converted into a three chamber but I'm
going<00:00:45.339> to<00:00:45.370> use<00:00:45.460> just<00:00:45.940> the<00:00:46.120> the<00:00:46.480> single<00:00:46.780> chamber

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.050 
going to use just the the single chamber

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:56.099 
going to use just the the single chamber
here<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:50.429> we'll<00:00:51.429> start<00:00:53.309> by<00:00:54.309> putting<00:00:55.149> the<00:00:55.600> bats

00:00:56.099 --> 00:00:56.109 
here and we'll start by putting the bats

00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:58.979 
here and we'll start by putting the bats
and<00:00:56.710> get<00:00:56.949> in<00:00:57.070> there<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:58.329> we'll<00:00:58.510> just<00:00:58.539> count

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989 
and get in there and we'll just count

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:01.849 
and get in there and we'll just count
out<00:00:59.140> and<00:00:59.320> see<00:00:59.440> how<00:00:59.589> many<00:00:59.769> we<00:00:59.920> can<00:01:00.010> get<00:01:00.190> in<00:01:00.309> here

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
out and see how many we can get in here

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:19.420 
out and see how many we can get in here
don't<00:01:02.859> know<00:01:07.409> pesky<00:01:08.409> little<00:01:08.560> critters

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.000 

well<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.910> answer<00:01:21.450> is<00:01:21.660> if<00:01:21.870> you<00:01:22.020> pack<00:01:22.350> them<00:01:22.620> real

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.010 
well the answer is if you pack them real

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.440 
well the answer is if you pack them real
tight<00:01:23.520> about<00:01:24.120> 300<00:01:24.900> I<00:01:26.030> could<00:01:27.030> probably<00:01:27.240> get

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
tight about 300 I could probably get

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:37.790 
tight about 300 I could probably get
about<00:01:27.570> 50<00:01:28.020> more<00:01:28.260> in<00:01:28.350> here<00:01:28.530> though

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:45.240 

they're<00:01:38.800> rubber<00:01:39.040> people<00:01:39.790> calm<00:01:40.240> down<00:01:44.100> we<00:01:45.100> do

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
they're rubber people calm down we do

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.330 
they're rubber people calm down we do
get<00:01:45.430> that<00:01:45.580> question<00:01:45.760> a<00:01:46.030> lot<00:01:46.060> that's<00:01:46.479> a

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
get that question a lot that's a

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.859 
get that question a lot that's a
question<00:01:48.340> that<00:01:50.520> is<00:01:51.520> kind<00:01:52.180> of<00:01:52.300> difficult<00:01:52.810> to

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
question that is kind of difficult to

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:59.070 
question that is kind of difficult to
answer<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:56.880> truth<00:01:57.880> about<00:01:58.090> how<00:01:58.450> many<00:01:58.660> bats

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
answer the truth about how many bats

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.780 
answer the truth about how many bats
will<00:01:59.409> fit<00:01:59.619> in<00:01:59.710> a<00:01:59.740> bat<00:01:59.920> house<00:02:00.100> it<00:02:00.400> depends<00:02:00.729> on

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
will fit in a bat house it depends on

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.550 
will fit in a bat house it depends on
the<00:02:00.940> species<00:02:01.180> of<00:02:01.420> the<00:02:01.659> bat<00:02:01.930> that<00:02:01.960> wants<00:02:02.530> to

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
the species of the bat that wants to

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.950 
the species of the bat that wants to
roost<00:02:03.300> if<00:02:04.300> you're<00:02:04.450> going<00:02:04.570> to<00:02:04.630> have<00:02:04.750> little

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
roost if you're going to have little

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.649 
roost if you're going to have little
brown<00:02:05.200> bats<00:02:05.440> come<00:02:05.710> around<00:02:06.150> this<00:02:07.150> bat<00:02:07.420> house

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
brown bats come around this bat house

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:10.740 
brown bats come around this bat house
for<00:02:07.960> example<00:02:08.850> single-chamber<00:02:09.850> here<00:02:10.239> believe

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
for example single-chamber here believe

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.540 
for example single-chamber here believe
it<00:02:10.869> or<00:02:10.959> not<00:02:11.280> if<00:02:12.280> they<00:02:12.580> wanted<00:02:13.230> 200<00:02:14.230> 125<00:02:15.190> of<00:02:15.459> them

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
it or not if they wanted 200 125 of them

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.259 
it or not if they wanted 200 125 of them
or<00:02:15.760> more<00:02:15.970> could<00:02:16.209> cram<00:02:16.510> in<00:02:16.660> here<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:18.700> reality

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:19.269 
or more could cram in here the reality

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:22.290 
or more could cram in here the reality
of<00:02:19.300> it<00:02:19.540> is<00:02:20.100> you're<00:02:21.100> probably<00:02:21.310> going<00:02:21.700> to<00:02:21.790> get<00:02:21.970> at

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
of it is you're probably going to get at

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.780 
of it is you're probably going to get at
most<00:02:22.660> maybe<00:02:23.110> around<00:02:23.320> 50<00:02:24.010> that<00:02:24.430> would<00:02:24.580> live

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
most maybe around 50 that would live

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.540 
most maybe around 50 that would live
inside<00:02:25.350> of<00:02:26.350> a<00:02:26.440> single<00:02:26.590> chamber<00:02:26.950> house<00:02:27.250> about

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
inside of a single chamber house about

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.430 
inside of a single chamber house about
this<00:02:27.790> size<00:02:28.030> and<00:02:28.630> in<00:02:29.350> fact<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:30.610> limiting<00:02:31.440> part

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
this size and in fact the limiting part

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:33.990 
this size and in fact the limiting part
of<00:02:32.560> this<00:02:32.680> is<00:02:32.950> probably<00:02:33.370> not<00:02:33.519> going<00:02:33.700> to<00:02:33.790> be<00:02:33.880> the

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
of this is probably not going to be the

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.340 
of this is probably not going to be the
house<00:02:34.150> it's<00:02:34.480> probably<00:02:34.900> going<00:02:34.989> to<00:02:35.050> be<00:02:35.140> your

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
house it's probably going to be your

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.550 
house it's probably going to be your
environment<00:02:35.950> how<00:02:36.880> many<00:02:37.030> bugs<00:02:37.269> are<00:02:37.540> around<00:02:37.870> how

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
environment how many bugs are around how

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.240 
environment how many bugs are around how
many<00:02:38.769> insects<00:02:39.190> if<00:02:39.550> you've<00:02:40.030> got<00:02:40.239> a<00:02:40.269> good

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
many insects if you've got a good

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.039 
many insects if you've got a good
habitat<00:02:42.250> for<00:02:42.489> them<00:02:42.610> to<00:02:42.760> live<00:02:42.940> in<00:02:42.970> they'll<00:02:43.870> pack

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
habitat for them to live in they'll pack

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:45.569 
habitat for them to live in they'll pack
this<00:02:44.290> house<00:02:44.470> full<00:02:44.739> and<00:02:44.950> they'll<00:02:45.040> hang<00:02:45.250> off<00:02:45.400> the

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:45.579 
this house full and they'll hang off the

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:46.920 
this house full and they'll hang off the
landing<00:02:45.910> board<00:02:46.150> and<00:02:46.420> they'll<00:02:46.510> be<00:02:46.630> looking<00:02:46.900> for

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
landing board and they'll be looking for

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:47.910 
landing board and they'll be looking for
other<00:02:47.200> roosts

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
other roosts

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.170 
other roosts
so<00:02:48.760> the<00:02:49.030> question<00:02:49.450> is<00:02:49.630> not<00:02:49.780> as<00:02:50.640> relevant<00:02:51.640> as<00:02:52.150> it

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
so the question is not as relevant as it

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.979 
so the question is not as relevant as it
would<00:02:52.450> seem<00:02:52.950> if<00:02:53.950> you<00:02:54.220> do<00:02:54.489> have<00:02:54.850> a<00:02:54.880> large<00:02:55.480> colony

00:02:55.979 --> 00:02:55.989 
would seem if you do have a large colony

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:57.900 
would seem if you do have a large colony
of<00:02:56.170> bats<00:02:56.380> around<00:02:56.829> and<00:02:57.040> you<00:02:57.130> need<00:02:57.640> to<00:02:57.760> get<00:02:57.880> a

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
of bats around and you need to get a

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.479 
of bats around and you need to get a
larger<00:02:58.329> house<00:02:58.510> for<00:02:58.840> them<00:02:58.959> that's<00:02:59.230> fine<00:02:59.530> but<00:03:00.459> I

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489

into the evenings and that's why we

Congress Avenue Bridge where they

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.980 
Congress Avenue Bridge where they
figured<00:03:57.160> out<00:03:57.340> that<00:03:57.730> if<00:03:58.060> you<00:03:58.390> counted<00:03:58.840> the

figured out that if you counted the

figured out that if you counted the

number of Mexican free-tailed bats in a
particular<00:04:01.930> area<00:04:02.170> and<00:04:02.800> then<00:04:03.250> figured<00:04:03.820> out<00:04:03.970> how

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
particular area and then figured out how

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.300 
particular area and then figured out how
many<00:04:04.180> cubic<00:04:04.660> inches<00:04:05.020> were<00:04:05.200> there<00:04:05.440> you<00:04:06.100> could

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
many cubic inches were there you could

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.820 
many cubic inches were there you could
kind<00:04:06.520> of<00:04:06.670> get<00:04:06.790> a<00:04:06.820> roosting<00:04:07.300> density<00:04:07.810> what<00:04:08.710> they

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
kind of get a roosting density what they

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:10.770 
kind of get a roosting density what they
discovered<00:04:09.430> is<00:04:09.610> that<00:04:09.640> the<00:04:10.360> roosting

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
discovered is that the roosting

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.680 
discovered is that the roosting
densities<00:04:11.350> were<00:04:11.560> as<00:04:11.740> high<00:04:11.950> as<00:04:12.480> one<00:04:13.480> and<00:04:13.630> a

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
densities were as high as one and a

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:19.920 
densities were as high as one and a
quarter<00:04:14.020> bats<00:04:14.790> per<00:04:15.790> cubic<00:04:16.510> inch<00:04:16.690> and<00:04:18.660> that<00:04:19.660> may

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
quarter bats per cubic inch and that may

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.290 
quarter bats per cubic inch and that may
be<00:04:19.989> true<00:04:20.410> for<00:04:20.440> that<00:04:21.070> specific<00:04:21.640> area<00:04:22.030> but

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
be true for that specific area but

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.570 
be true for that specific area but
they've<00:04:22.840> got<00:04:23.050> a<00:04:23.080> huge<00:04:23.470> area<00:04:23.950> that<00:04:24.130> they<00:04:24.400> can

spread out they'll gather during the day
they've<00:04:27.370> got<00:04:27.550> a<00:04:27.580> lot<00:04:27.850> of<00:04:27.880> space<00:04:28.270> that's

experience in seeing the bats roost in
the<00:04:35.170> houses<00:04:35.650> is<00:04:35.860> that<00:04:36.130> it's<00:04:36.400> it's<00:04:36.700> just<00:04:36.970> not<00:04:37.150> a

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
the houses is that it's it's just not a

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.620 
the houses is that it's it's just not a
realistic<00:04:37.630> number<00:04:38.400> what<00:04:39.400> I<00:04:39.640> try<00:04:40.060> to<00:04:40.090> do<00:04:40.330> is<00:04:40.480> to

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
realistic number what I try to do is to

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:42.210 
realistic number what I try to do is to
tell<00:04:40.810> you<00:04:40.960> how<00:04:41.140> many<00:04:41.200> cubic<00:04:41.740> inches<00:04:42.040> of

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
tell you how many cubic inches of

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.010 
tell you how many cubic inches of
roosting<00:04:42.730> space<00:04:43.000> is<00:04:43.270> in<00:04:43.450> each<00:04:43.600> one<00:04:43.630> of<00:04:43.930> our

in<00:04:58.540> order<00:04:58.690> to<00:04:58.840> get<00:04:59.200> 300<00:04:59.800> bats<00:04:59.980> in<00:05:00.280> here<00:05:00.520> it's

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:00.730 
in order to get 300 bats in here it's

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:02.880
