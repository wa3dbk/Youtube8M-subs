00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
 Greetings, I 'm Jrl 20 with a new video 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.790
 where I will criticize 4 channels that used to 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.250
 be great but now they are just one 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.210
 shadow of what these channels are 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.120
 nickelodeon 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.580
 disney xd before the great fox kids 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.550
 discovery kids and finally cartoon 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.890
 network will see I'm not a nostalgia fap 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.500
 someone who believes that everything new is 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.170
 trash and treat the old as if it were 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.720
 sacred I know that today there are still things 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.570
 good but despite that there has been a 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.940
 decadence in the mentioned channels 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:38.070
 before when I was a child I remember that they were 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.350
 hours and hours of fun at the time of 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.570
 watch TV but now the few 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.059
 good programs that remain I can 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.190
 count up with your fingers without a 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.520
 introduction let's criticize our 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.920
 first channel nickelodeon before had the 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.010
 motto of being a channel made for children 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.500
 something that really fulfilled the programs 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.960
 they were of quality and at that time 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.449
 competed at that time 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.090
 big channel cartoon network but 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.200
 currently this channel became very 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.570
 commercial 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.140
 with pseudo comedies that disque laugh 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.219
 when in reality these series 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.350
 supposedly comedy alone 

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:20.460
 they promote people who quote 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:23.220
 sing well and I reiterate in quotes in 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.649
 these pseudo comedies all act with 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.649
 mental retardation and for whatever they put 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:31.350
 the pre-recorded laughs to pretend that 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:34.229
 if it makes you laugh these comedies give others grief 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:37.350
 they are not what they were and what about iquitos 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.959
 and as I said before, these pseudo 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.539
 comedies are very commercial the 

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:45.479
 some cartoons are already very 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:48.869
 burned and used example 'spongebob' 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.450
 and the magical godparents currently only 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.579
 the penguins of madagascar and kung fu 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.209
 panda 'is the only thing that calls it the 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:59.970
 attention to jrr 20 and that at night 

00:01:57.209 --> 00:02:03.299
 almost at dawn they give the series that 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.340
 they gave the next channel before 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.459
 I will talk is the channel disney ex team 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.600
 although xp has nothing this channel 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.450
 used to be 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.990
 channel fox kids channel loved by many 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:18.540
 including jlr 20 had a good 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:21.510
 programming of all kinds but one day 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.330
 Disney arrived and bought it by converting it 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:27.000
 in the jetix channel at the beginning of 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.730
 first year of its transmission everything is 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.190
 kept the same as before it was like watching fox 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.650
 kids only with the jetix logo but 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.870
 after the year the channel decayed when 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.240
 disney began to remove several of the 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.330
 fox keys programs that were not your 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.550
 taste and add other low quality that 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.490
 it can be noticed with the saga of power 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:50.730
 rangers after buying disney envelopes 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:53.220
 avant old property fox kits the 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.830
 generations of power rangers produced 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.930
 by disney were low quality both 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.480
 in history effects and even in 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.730
 performances where they were asked to 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.830
 actors who did not delve into their 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.740
 characters and where they fired the 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:10.860
 be in the USA leaving many in the 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.819
 unemployment and hiring a new staff 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.060
 from new zealand 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:17.579
 cheap then years later it became 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.010
 in the disney xd unlike when 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:22.829
 fox kids happened to be jetix that only 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.689
 changed two programs this changed almost 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:27.719
 all the programming to happen to be 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:29.969
 disney extinguishes one would believe that the channel 

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:32.430
 would improve but it went from bad to worse or 

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:34.709
 just as nickelodeon the channel was filled 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:38.609
 of cheap and commercial comedies keith 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:41.129
 phoenix said before now to jrr 20 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:44.310
 that does not like of this channel under terra 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:46.739
 kick buttowski and the avengers doing 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:50.189
 a note apart at the moment that 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:52.379
 this video was uploaded to jrr 20 was 

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:54.810
 annoying because the latest series' the 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:57.810
 Avengers' their favorite series of this 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.000
 disney channel xd records only the 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.909
 weekends at 7 o'clock in the morning 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.379
 who lightning gets up at that time in 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:06.750
 Weekend 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:09.689
 the next channel that I will talk about is the 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.939
 discovery kids first of all I'm not going to 

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:14.669
 put me in the foolishness of criticizing 

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:16.949
 preschool programs since children 

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:17.970
 little ones also have the right to see 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:20.250
 programs for 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:23.280
 them but based on this argument 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.980
 I say and what about us people who do not 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.410
 is preschool we also have the right to 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:31.200
 see our programs thing that before 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.270
 discovery kids left us the programs 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:36.360
 that discovery kids gave were super 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:39.780
 interesting educational entertaining 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:43.380
 popular mechanical example for children how 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:45.990
 and why reboot ghost writer between 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.210
 others but what happened what 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.940
 happened was that the discovery kids was 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:54.090
 originally only given in Latin America 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:56.490
 but one day it was released to usa as 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:59.940
 part of a block called discovery 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:02.310
 kids mbc on Saturday mornings given 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.710
 this one in abc signed a contract with 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.930
 discovery networks so that discovery 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.390
 I saw all the programming as I saw it 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.370
 in the discovery kids mvc block 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:13.710
 ie if the block Discovery Kids 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.900
 in ibc it would have been transmitted in the 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:18.330
 late instead of the morning that was when 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.730
 preschool programming was given 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:23.130
 the discovery kids would actually follow 

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:24.270
 as it was before and it would not be pure 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.910
 preschool 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:29.610
 four hours a day as if a child 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:32.040
 preschooler was awake at one o'clock 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.260
 in the morning there my point is made 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.840
 too unfair that they only put 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:39.420
 preschool programming when they used to 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:41.700
 give such good programs to us 

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:44.310
 We also have the right to see our 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:47.430
 own programming but discovery kits 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:50.190
 he does not see him like that and leaving discovery kids 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:52.710
 aside I'll talk about cartoon network 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:55.530
 this channel used to be the cherry of the 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:57.750
 cake on children's channels the favorite 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:00.600
 of thousands in their golden years but 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:03.060
 currently this channel has been criticized 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:05.700
 much given its decline in the past 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:08.190
 many years have complained about cartoon 

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:10.350
 network given that blocks like tuna me 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:13.470
 they were removed to what I also 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:15.900
 I really wanted to know that in the USA 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:18.420
 programming of cartoon networks de en 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:20.820
 hd and have that among other luxuries that 

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:23.190
 here is not frustrating anymore the fact that 

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:25.320
 there has been a severe decline many 

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:28.200
 of the programs that premiered in 

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:30.840
 the last years were loose and of little 

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:33.389
 quality although recently to different 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:35.340
 of the three previous channels that only 

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:37.949
 they stay in their decline and we 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:40.320
 they bother to leave it in noticed that 

00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:42.990
 cartoon network has been improving a bit 

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:46.080
 and currently it's better than a couple 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:48.690
 of years I've seen good programs like 

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:51.600
 a show more mat dragons of shame 

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:54.479
 justice young the lantern series 

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:57.090
 green among others although clarified the channel 

00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:59.400
 still in poor condition with programs like 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:01.979
 the cecu and the homosexual gumball world 

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:04.530
 and more than just give movies very 

00:07:01.979 --> 00:07:06.810
 repetitive and not varied as before 

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:08.910
 but at least I see that he tries 

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:12.030
 improve in a slow and progressive process 

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:15.360
 best slow pace that lasts instead of 

00:07:12.030 --> 00:07:17.610
 trot that canse I say another good point 

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:19.889
 in their favor is that at dawn they 

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:22.650
 your old programs just like 

00:07:19.889 --> 00:07:25.169
 nickelodeon in conclusion I say what 

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:27.139
 next nickelodeon and disney xd are 

00:07:25.169 --> 00:07:30.060
 for me very commercial channels 

00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:32.820
 discovery kits an injustice occurred 

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:35.850
 terrible and as soon as cartoon network has 

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:37.200
 I have been improving little but despite that this one 

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:40.830
 He lost the magic that 

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:44.210
 I had before good that's all I 'm me jrl 

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:44.210
 20 until next time
