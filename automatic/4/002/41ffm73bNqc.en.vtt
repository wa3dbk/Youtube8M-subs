00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:16.250
 today the video a bit useless but 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:19.550
 who can still be used for someone 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.289
 you so the video that how kring it 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.810
 is as registered in session 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:26.810
 so it's very simple it's two times 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:32.060
 with stuff to buy so really 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:33.800
 roses need the assets and 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:37.160
 passive bio at the bottom of the map 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.270
 here so to access marianne you me 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.250
 disgust more beautiful days what he has 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.890
 did or did you see it work and not 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.650
 very long or work I'm not 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:50.930
 too much it can be a good year so 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:53.990
 we look like before I wanted this cry 1.1 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:56.990
 to diogen so an aliot james fromayan 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.210
 jimmy rela kraft and where we can 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:01.430
 buy directly 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:27.400
 so it's your choice it's not good 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:27.400
 dear ali and his family i do not know 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:48.590
 I like did not recover from her these 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:51.830
 families no but I do not write 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:57.409
 she did not go very long 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:58.070
 with cross we see the climb before the 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:04.220
 public fashion 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:06.170
 so I always wanted to 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.500
 go where the time is going on we would see 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.500
 others 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:27.410
 directly you often that when 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:28.880
 wait and we'll see what it is 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.880
 think I could not go back to dhr 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:35.980
 but we see game to show where there is 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.980
 the she will do the left 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:59.750
 I have no idea I 'm selling it so I 'm 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:03:01.930
 not very clear if we had in your 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.930
 language 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:10.520
 so that's it too when we can 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:14.360
 do buy both so we go 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:17.030
 consider the boat ready to go to me 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.600
 I paid this trio because I find this 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:24.260
 is not for you 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:27.590
 I live in dethrone explains John I like 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.660
 well in power because otherwise I do not 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:36.950
 do everything good for me judge lorne 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:39.290
 michaels which i explain matic to live 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.570
 so work is to be too mounted 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.060
 but who so clever of this effect handed 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:46.100
 things like that these expedients nothing 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.200
 done in a war that kills the game the 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:50.769
 pair whose water it allows to keep it 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.470
