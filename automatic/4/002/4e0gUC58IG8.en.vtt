00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:05.430
 wide enough to knead add 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.890
 the flour 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:14.560
 [Music] 

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:17.750
 we add about 200 250 grams of sugar 

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:21.620
 and we put water when it's very dramatic 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:23.630
 hot we add 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:26.349
 to the flour 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.349
 as you see 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:32.400
 the hot butter produces a certain 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:36.000
 effect in the same pan 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.580
 We are heating the water for sugar 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.640
 [Music] 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.720
 [Applause] 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:47.790
 and here we will add a little salt 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.790
 as i tell you more 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.930
 how are we heating in water 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:00.110
 and meanwhile the water 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:03.170
 walk with the butter we are doing 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.090
 in this good story sometime when 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.280
 I was working in camps 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:09.480
 oil tankers happened once we had 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.020
 that inaugurate a work 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.020
 the gas pipeline 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.760
 at all that led between five others 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.890
 to definitive 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.290
 an opportunity had to come the 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.700
 president part with the present of 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:27.680
 Brazil at the time of construction 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.680
 in the opportunity I had an assistant 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:34.190
 and very irresponsible cooking but also 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.080
 He had many traditions 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.870
 then he was going to take care of the soup 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.270
 wonderfully 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:43.540
 my vocation on that occasion did the 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:48.360
 peanut soup with chicken legs good 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:51.360
 need to be a surprise that the 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.360
 delicious 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.960
 if it is not so hot it is 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.960
 preferable 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:06.079
 [Music] 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.079
 It has sugar and a little salt 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.510
 and here we add the game 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:18.010
 already at this moment the mass can be 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.970
 work also has to be a little 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.970
 rather natural 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.600
 because if I tell you about this mass 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:32.220
 this you can put it once cool from 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:36.030
 far anything is not going to open 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.030
 as long as it does 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:44.830
 The golds clear their proper thickness 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.970
 we have the prepared dough now what happened 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.610
 good now 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:52.769
 when performing the mass stretch 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:56.000
 the stuffing of it 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:59.790
 and here we have the mass 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:03.450
 practically ready to use this is 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.810
 our stuffing that we're going to use and 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.799
 the same 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:10.879
 we are going to add some olives 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:15.560
 later we are going to paint it with 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:19.220
 egg and a little sugar a mold to 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:22.840
 that we previously go to butter 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.840
 we put a little butter 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:31.200
 and so they are not going to hit us sharing the 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.290
 mass for which 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.250
 [Music] 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:38.350
 we cut it 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.350
 in small balls 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:47.889
 [Music] 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.620
 we put two spoons 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:08.020
 [Music] 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:11.950
 and now we proceed 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:15.030
 around our hair wounds 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.030
 but the same 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:19.720
 let's not try to throw too much 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:21.759
 so that we do not burst 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.030
 later because filling by the 

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:24.030
 jelly 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:44.480
 and our mass can break it 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:47.630
 [Music] 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:50.470
 You can also make meat so 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.470
 only chicken 

00:04:52.809 --> 00:04:57.450
 exactly 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.450
 [Music] 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:05.419
 finished the pan is already in term 

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:09.180
 Well, if I have a cat, they told me 

00:05:08.209 --> 00:05:11.009
 really 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.580
 [Music] 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:13.580
 i 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:19.400
 that 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:22.240
 the color 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:25.710
 we put it in the oven that has 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.710
 the temperature of this one 

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:32.459
 and we close the door 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.040
 during 20 minutes 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.490
 and now we proceed to take our salt 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.529
 ie developing rocks 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.529
 [Music] 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.810
 we have the leave 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:11.650
 and a snack
