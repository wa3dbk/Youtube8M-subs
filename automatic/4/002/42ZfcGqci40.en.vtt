00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
let me share a metaphor just as I was

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.570 
let me share a metaphor just as I was
thinking<00:00:15.780> about<00:00:15.930> vitamin<00:00:16.530> D<00:00:16.710> I<00:00:16.980> said<00:00:17.430> well

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
thinking about vitamin D I said well

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.940 
thinking about vitamin D I said well
it's<00:00:17.670> not<00:00:17.730> just<00:00:18.030> vitamin<00:00:18.480> D<00:00:18.630> it's<00:00:18.900> a<00:00:19.140> B<00:00:19.440> and<00:00:19.740> C

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:19.950 
it's not just vitamin D it's a B and C

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.100 
it's not just vitamin D it's a B and C
and<00:00:20.250> E<00:00:20.640> and<00:00:20.850> on<00:00:21.450> the<00:00:21.600> whole<00:00:21.750> alphabet<00:00:21.990> and

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:24.110 
and E and on the whole alphabet and

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.380 
and E and on the whole alphabet and
nutrition<00:00:25.110> is<00:00:25.350> basically<00:00:26.070> our<00:00:26.490> story<00:00:27.180> it's

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
nutrition is basically our story it's

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.290 
nutrition is basically our story it's
very<00:00:27.480> much<00:00:27.869> like<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.680> alphabet<00:00:29.099> and<00:00:29.640> a<00:00:30.000> book

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
very much like the alphabet and a book

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.819 
very much like the alphabet and a book
even<00:00:30.689> and<00:00:31.560> our<00:00:31.800> diet<00:00:32.009> is<00:00:32.400> the<00:00:32.700> book<00:00:33.060> but<00:00:33.270> every

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 
even and our diet is the book but every

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.180 
even and our diet is the book but every
letter<00:00:34.829> is<00:00:35.220> a<00:00:35.550> food<00:00:36.079> so<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.110> could<00:00:37.590> be<00:00:37.620> apples

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
letter is a food so a could be apples

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.990 
letter is a food so a could be apples
artichokes<00:00:38.940> asparagus<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:40.220> each<00:00:41.220> word<00:00:41.610> is

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
artichokes asparagus and each word is

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.700 
artichokes asparagus and each word is
the<00:00:42.210> meal<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.630> different<00:00:42.930> foods<00:00:43.200> we<00:00:43.440> put

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
the meal the different foods we put

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.190 
the meal the different foods we put
together<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.490> then<00:00:45.480> maybe<00:00:45.690> we<00:00:45.960> write<00:00:46.170> a

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
together and then maybe we write a

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.650 
together and then maybe we write a
little<00:00:46.530> one<00:00:47.070> sentence<00:00:47.520> for<00:00:47.790> every<00:00:48.120> day<00:00:48.360> of

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
little one sentence for every day of

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.940 
little one sentence for every day of
what<00:00:48.870> we<00:00:48.990> eat<00:00:49.200> such<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:50.870> we<00:00:51.870> combine<00:00:52.320> several

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:52.950 
what we eat such that we combine several

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.850 
what we eat such that we combine several
words<00:00:53.340> at<00:00:53.700> each<00:00:53.850> meal<00:00:54.150> and<00:00:54.540> all<00:00:54.840> those<00:00:55.140> ten<00:00:55.740> or

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
words at each meal and all those ten or

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.280 
words at each meal and all those ten or
twelve<00:00:56.100> words<00:00:56.340> that<00:00:57.000> we'll<00:00:57.210> eat<00:00:57.450> over<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.080> day

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:58.290 
twelve words that we'll eat over the day

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:03.070 
twelve words that we'll eat over the day
will<00:00:59.300> be<00:01:00.300> our<00:01:00.540> one<00:01:00.750> sentence<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.410> then<00:01:02.100> maybe

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:03.080 
will be our one sentence and then maybe

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.710 
will be our one sentence and then maybe
the<00:01:04.080> week<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:05.189> little<00:01:05.339> paragraph<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.210> the

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
the week is a little paragraph and the

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.620 
the week is a little paragraph and the
month<00:01:06.990> is<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.439> whole<00:01:07.710> page<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.460> then<00:01:09.240> we<00:01:09.390> look

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
month is a whole page and then we look

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.429 
month is a whole page and then we look
at<00:01:10.579> you<00:01:11.579> know<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.970> year<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.600> then<00:01:12.930> that's<00:01:13.170> a

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
at you know the year and then that's a

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.160 
at you know the year and then that's a
chapter<00:01:14.240> and<00:01:15.240> we<00:01:15.360> look<00:01:15.510> at<00:01:15.630> our<00:01:15.720> life<00:01:15.990> and

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
chapter and we look at our life and

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.040 
chapter and we look at our life and
we've<00:01:16.350> written<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.710> whole<00:01:16.890> book<00:01:16.950> about<00:01:17.490> all<00:01:18.300> the

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.050 
we've written a whole book about all the

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.290 
we've written a whole book about all the
choices<00:01:19.440> that<00:01:19.680> we've<00:01:19.980> made<00:01:20.010> which<00:01:20.550> is<00:01:20.730> to<00:01:21.060> me

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.300 
choices that we've made which is to me

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.649 
choices that we've made which is to me
one<00:01:21.840> of<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:21.990> most<00:01:22.110> important<00:01:23.360> concepts<00:01:24.360> about

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
one of the most important concepts about

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.750 
one of the most important concepts about
health<00:01:25.260> because<00:01:25.980> when<00:01:26.159> we<00:01:26.310> make<00:01:26.490> better

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:26.760 
health because when we make better

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.100 
health because when we make better
choices<00:01:26.990> we<00:01:27.990> create<00:01:28.710> better<00:01:28.950> health<00:01:29.420> and<00:01:30.420> so

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
choices we create better health and so

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.750 
choices we create better health and so
if<00:01:31.200> we're<00:01:31.409> making<00:01:31.560> better<00:01:31.920> choices<00:01:32.070> of<00:01:32.670> our

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:32.760 
if we're making better choices of our

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.490 
if we're making better choices of our
letters<00:01:33.270> our<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.830> B<00:01:35.130> for<00:01:35.790> broccoli<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.900> C

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
letters our a and B for broccoli and C

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.789 
letters our a and B for broccoli and C
for<00:01:37.830> carrots<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.460> cauliflower<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:39.690> D<00:01:40.440> for
