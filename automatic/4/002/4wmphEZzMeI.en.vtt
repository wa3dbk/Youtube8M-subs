00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.440
 and good morning to all of you, I hope 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.580
 that you're fine today we get 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.619
 so find for a new tutorial 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.779
 again for how to optimize 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.360
 his games so we are interested today 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.250
 to razer cortex so this is a new 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.349
 software a little bit in the lineage of 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.360
 razer game booster and all I have 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:36.470
 already presented before we were doing 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:38.899
 just point out that if you have razer 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.149
 game booster I advise you to move 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:42.980
 under razer cortex since there are plenty of 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:44.469
 novelties in fact so that's it 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.880
 that's what I'll say at the beginning 

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:48.920
 then I'm very followed by 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.300
 subject so you type razer cortex on 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.640
 google you will arrive on this page 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.710
 you download it simply 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.000
 then install it at the bottom of the page 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.780
 so there you can see all the 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.310
 what's new in this software you're going 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.930
 click on get started so if you 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.150
 want a little bit of a tutorial actually 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.590
 more than I mean it's written 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.659
 so it's sometimes a little bit more 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.040
 simple but here I am going to try to 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:13.430
 you that you are also presenting the 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.899
 software as a whole so razr 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.630
 cortex looks like what it looks like 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:19.220
 to that here are four tabs so the 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.890
 first game tab very similar to 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.440
 razer game booster so here we all 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.110
 our games so from our office our 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.960
 menu start and our judges estimate and 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.120
 origins seems to me yes if you want 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.159
 new ones so you press yourself on 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.210
 the most forgiveness and where you add 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.710
 games you are going to get your 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.710
 point exe simply 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.030
 then we could search for games 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.590
 and refresh the list of games you 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.979
 that's done then so you 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.960
 have a tab off this is a new 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:53.119
 novelty it's a new tab by donation 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.350
 ellis still in beta so in fact it's okay 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.140
 to calm down a little bit all the offers 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.490
 of steam is original I think so 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.780
 you will be able to finally buy 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:01.460
 not tried but basically if you 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.380
 titles the info law the sarre groove a 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.960
 little bit all the offers of the games 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.580
 video it's really winnable hole 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.379
 to actually have it then we come in 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.150
 in the heart of the subject so English 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:15.049
 increased so it's here a little bit 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.879
 we are going to boost our games here is here 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:18.760
 very classic so the button booster 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:21.069
 now if you want to put your 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.110
 your software or your pc in boost mode 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.879
 here are all keyboard shortcuts here 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.599
 again so here we find a 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:32.140
 little razer game booster at the time 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:34.299
 so little custom subtlety 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.980
 pushed for those who know a 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:38.790
 little if not put in recommended I 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.230
 advise you if you do not know too much 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.909
 finally what to do here was putting in 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.980
 recommended it will avoid making 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:46.750
 nonsense so here is the first tab 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.689
 so process so that's what 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.879
 process you want your 

00:02:49.689 --> 00:02:53.290
 computer cut when you go 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:54.489
 click on booster now so here 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.109
 if I click on booster now 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:59.139
 dropbox will close 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:02.049
 if I come back in normal mode three boxes 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:04.180
 to re-open these are simply the 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:05.680
 unnecessary services low and small 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.329
 services like saba as his name 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.799
 the indicated in fact that is useless 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:10.450
 So I check almost all of you 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:12.519
 let's look at the 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.750
 description which is below for 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:17.200
 know when it's good 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.099
 never the service is windows so 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.000
 it's still up to you to see it's 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:21.730
 a little bit all the services that are 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.699
 annex to windows I would say a little bit 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.560
 all customers all customers at jo 

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:27.549
 I would say you want a little bit ago 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.900
 apple the bluetooth 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:31.329
 that's a little bit of everything that's a 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.609
 axis to windows and then in other bah 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:34.900
 that's a little bit as good as you 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:35.590
 seems you can not feel like your 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.620
 RAM memory 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.579
 empty your trash off of a 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.739
 update automatically 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:43.840
 this is me, I'm really close to you 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:46.980
 to see then so we have to English from 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.540
 diagnosis already present dr game booster 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.489
 you can analyze it's pretty useful 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.019
 sometimes when wanted to know if there is 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:54.879
 not a malfunction on your pc 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:56.500
 in the forums especially times he 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:58.349
 asks you to do an analysis or 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:02.319
 what you can do with it 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:04.440
 in settings there is a novelty is 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:08.260
 there so you can see a little bit 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:10.840
 how to say comments from 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.609
 settings that are not directly 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:17.380
 related to your game but no longer to your pc 

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:19.269
 I will take the example of closing more 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.919
 rare no forgiveness close the system more 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.690
 quickly you see that if you tick 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:25.180
 that you can for example maybe 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:28.360
 your camp then you have on windows 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:30.150
 stopped that your pc some more 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.650
 quickly veil us for that c 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.210
 the present value there as you can 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.710
 to see him he could add a new 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:38.040
 value of which you speak if I'm going to put 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:40.320
 2000 I can put 2 min I press on 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.730
 optimally honestly I do not do that 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.320
 I prefer my recommendation because 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.130
 that after I'm scared maybe that saw that 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.300
 that's a little bit more 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.010
 system features 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.260
 I'm afraid maybe it disturbs a 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.630
 little bit my pc so here I prefer 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.910
 leave it afterwards for those 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:56.160
 who want to try to personalize 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.740
 a little bit of all that they can then 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.990
 we arrive in a new novelty on 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:03.270
 being able to defragment these games 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.380
 this is to be noted that we can not 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.640
 defragment as it is written in 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.020
 below the games lying on the 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.880
 this is why league of legend 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.440
 and gray and I can not I can not 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.550
 not say fragmented on the other hand arma2 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.500
 arma ii king 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.330
 I can very well so I click on it 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.560
 I press defragment actually it's okay 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.020
 a little bit tidy up my little ones 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.550
 files for my load to be 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.560
 a little bit faster 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.430
 so that's it if you do not have the game 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.580
 in the list you can always 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:30.630
 add the exe point again 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:34.140
 so the shape if I'm going to pace 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:35.430
 in arma iii i will take my gun to 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:38.130
 three points ex here they add to 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:40.170
 the list that I spent very briefly 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.580
 if you want it to show the fps in 

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:44.960
 top left bottom right this if they 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:48.840
 were already in the old and finally a 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:51.090
 very good novelty I think the bread 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.590
 you can now sync your 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:59.010
 backups in fact so on your 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:06:02.580
 dropbox account or on your account or 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:03.990
 on your google drive account so here is 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.670
 the hunt was in the process of 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:08.280
 synchronize it's okay I'm going 

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:09.660
 you will put all this back so if in fact 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.490
 it's going to dictate the game you have on your 

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:13.290
 pc so as you can see 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:14.310
 the location and did not find as there 

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:16.260
 you can see there there is a small to 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:18.150
 little red triangle must click on it 

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:20.490
 and you are going to put where and where is 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:23.550
 your game on your record there could 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:24.930
 see that I do them on arma iii and that 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.640
 there if I put synchronized now 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:30.090
 that's going to sync so me 

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:31.320
 I put on dropbox so the 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:32.910
 synchronization will be frankly 

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:34.680
 that I think it's really not bad if by 

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:36.480
 example you need to format 

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.800
 your pc or what sometimes we lose a 

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.660
 little bit the steam games files 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.740
 not keep or that's the backups it's 

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.480
 true it's a little tricky sometimes 

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.890
 with that if you go 

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.900
 easily find them easily 

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:47.760
 restore or update them here is 

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:49.050
 so I find it really not bad so 

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.400
 this is a novelty you can 

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:52.290
 to put it automatically or not it's like 

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.580
 you want it and finally share 

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:56.100
 that's all that screenshots 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:59.730
 the video captures ca it's enough 

00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:01.560
 known in this type of software so 

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:02.580
 I hope you enjoyed it 

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.770
 went a little fast on 

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:06.450
 some points do not hesitate to review 

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:08.130
 the video or so go to the site that 

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:10.140
 I was doing everything at their quest started 

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:12.390
 here it is so I hope that you 

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:14.210
 will have pleased more thank you for being more and 

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:16.530
