for measure five to 12 a lot if you

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.500 
for measure five to 12 a lot if you
recall<00:02:51.830> when<00:02:52.010> you<00:02:52.040> heard<00:02:52.310> my<00:02:52.360> performance<00:02:53.360> of

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
recall when you heard my performance of

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.410 
recall when you heard my performance of
it<00:02:53.660> that<00:02:54.320> eight<00:02:54.650> bar<00:02:54.920> phrase<00:02:55.220> is<00:02:55.700> the<00:02:56.120> same

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
it that eight bar phrase is the same

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.280 
it that eight bar phrase is the same
exact<00:02:56.690> thing<00:02:56.720> is<00:02:57.110> measure<00:02:57.320> 13<00:02:57.890> to<00:02:58.160> 21<00:02:58.730> and<00:02:59.570> is

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
exact thing is measure 13 to 21 and is

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.460 
exact thing is measure 13 to 21 and is
the<00:03:00.380> same<00:03:00.560> thing<00:03:00.680> I<00:03:00.740> think<00:03:00.770> is<00:03:01.040> 29<00:03:01.490> to<00:03:01.850> 36<00:03:02.450> so<00:03:03.350> if

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
the same thing I think is 29 to 36 so if

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.350 
the same thing I think is 29 to 36 so if
you<00:03:03.590> learn<00:03:03.710> that<00:03:03.770> eight<00:03:04.100> bars<00:03:04.370> that<00:03:04.820> set<00:03:05.180> you

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
you learn that eight bars that set you

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.240 
you learn that eight bars that set you
for<00:03:05.600> the<00:03:05.690> next<00:03:05.870> eight<00:03:05.990> bars<00:03:06.260> and<00:03:06.710> that<00:03:07.040> eight

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
for the next eight bars and that eight

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.580 
for the next eight bars and that eight
bars<00:03:07.490> later<00:03:07.790> Tim<00:03:08.090> so<00:03:08.600> that's<00:03:08.780> pretty<00:03:09.380> much

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
bars later Tim so that's pretty much

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.350 
bars later Tim so that's pretty much
half<00:03:09.770> the<00:03:09.950> song<00:03:10.190> so<00:03:10.850> don't<00:03:11.090> go<00:03:11.209> crazy

after that watch your fingering and then

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:18.810 
after that watch your fingering and then
you<00:04:17.290> go<00:04:17.500> right<00:04:17.709> back<00:04:17.829> into<00:04:18.130> the<00:04:18.220> same<00:04:18.489> thing

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
you go right back into the same thing

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:22.530 
you go right back into the same thing
it's<00:04:19.180> just<00:04:19.389> up<00:04:19.510> about<00:04:19.720> this<00:04:21.240> just<00:04:22.240> like<00:04:22.389> that

it's just up about this just like that
measure<00:04:22.900> 19<00:04:23.380> okay<00:04:24.190> so<00:04:25.230> then<00:04:26.230> we<00:04:26.320> get<00:04:26.410> into<00:04:26.560> this

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
measure 19 okay so then we get into this

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.500 
measure 19 okay so then we get into this
D<00:04:26.889> section<00:04:27.160> in<00:04:27.400> a<00:04:27.460> B<00:04:27.639> section<00:04:28.060> we<00:04:28.150> have<00:04:28.270> a<00:04:28.330> whole

D section in a B section we have a whole

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:36.170 
D section in a B section we have a whole
different<00:04:28.780> feel

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.870 

not<00:04:36.450> in<00:04:36.750> there<00:04:36.930> but<00:04:37.410> in<00:04:37.620> a<00:04:37.800> minor<00:04:38.040> instead<00:04:38.520> of<00:04:38.700> C

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
not in there but in a minor instead of C

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:47.180 
not in there but in a minor instead of C
major

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.520 

get<00:04:48.190> so<00:04:48.400> really<00:04:49.030> work<00:04:49.660> out<00:04:49.810> that<00:04:50.050> rhythm<00:04:50.260> make

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
get so really work out that rhythm make

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:51.780 
get so really work out that rhythm make
sure<00:04:50.650> it<00:04:50.710> sounds<00:04:50.980> just<00:04:51.040> like<00:04:51.220> that<00:04:51.400> intro

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:51.790 
sure it sounds just like that intro

00:04:51.790 --> 00:05:00.240 
sure it sounds just like that intro
count<00:04:52.240> that<00:04:52.480> one<00:04:52.810> and<00:04:58.560> don't<00:04:59.560> stop<00:04:59.830> until<00:05:00.040> that

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
count that one and don't stop until that

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:01.710 
count that one and don't stop until that
sounds<00:05:00.580> right<00:05:00.760> because<00:05:01.000> if<00:05:01.150> you<00:05:01.240> practice<00:05:01.600> it

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
sounds right because if you practice it

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.050 
sounds right because if you practice it
wrong<00:05:01.930> for<00:05:02.230> four<00:05:02.470> days<00:05:02.680> then<00:05:03.100> you're<00:05:03.520> getting

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
wrong for four days then you're getting

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.930 
wrong for four days then you're getting
convalescence<00:05:04.450> and<00:05:04.870> I'm<00:05:05.050> gonna<00:05:05.200> hate<00:05:05.350> you<00:05:05.940> not

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
mr. 20 million is back to a section we

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:17.550 
mr. 20 million is back to a section we
have<00:05:12.790> a<00:05:12.820> chromatic<00:05:13.600> scale<00:05:16.320> then<00:05:17.320> we<00:05:17.410> have<00:05:17.500> a

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
have a chromatic scale then we have a

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:22.950 
have a chromatic scale then we have a
little<00:05:17.740> code<00:05:20.850> and<00:05:21.850> then<00:05:22.210> we<00:05:22.300> have<00:05:22.420> a<00:05:22.450> big<00:05:22.660> -

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 
little code and then we have a big -

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:28.860 
little code and then we have a big -
Hana<00:05:23.200> chromatic<00:05:23.620> scale<00:05:27.420> this<00:05:28.420> is<00:05:28.600> kind<00:05:28.840> of

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870 
Hana chromatic scale this is kind of

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:30.720 
Hana chromatic scale this is kind of
tricky<00:05:29.080> at<00:05:29.380> measure<00:05:29.590> 13<00:05:29.950> up<00:05:30.070> we<00:05:30.250> want<00:05:30.430> to<00:05:30.490> start
