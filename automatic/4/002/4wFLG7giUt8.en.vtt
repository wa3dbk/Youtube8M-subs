gonna be doing a marine SCV all in
that's<00:02:30.170> probably<00:02:30.470> the<00:02:31.130> closest<00:02:31.549> thing<00:02:31.700> that

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
that's probably the closest thing that

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.360 
that's probably the closest thing that
we're<00:02:31.940> going<00:02:32.030> to<00:02:32.090> get<00:02:32.239> okay<00:02:33.049> and<00:02:33.560> there<00:02:34.160> no

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
we're going to get okay and there no

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:35.890 
we're going to get okay and there no
there<00:02:34.519> is<00:02:34.640> a<00:02:34.670> fine<00:02:34.970> line<00:02:35.000> between<00:02:35.299> what<00:02:35.720> is<00:02:35.750> a

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
there is a fine line between what is a

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.780 
there is a fine line between what is a
cheese<00:02:36.200> and<00:02:36.230> what's<00:02:36.709> an<00:02:36.830> all<00:02:36.950> in<00:02:37.190> but<00:02:37.430> you<00:02:37.670> know

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
cheese and what's an all in but you know

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.090 
cheese and what's an all in but you know
if<00:02:37.880> that's<00:02:38.060> the<00:02:38.150> case<00:02:38.360> a<00:02:38.739> well<00:02:39.739> we'll<00:02:39.920> let<00:02:40.040> it

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
if that's the case a well we'll let it

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.570 
if that's the case a well we'll let it
will<00:02:40.700> let<00:02:40.820> it<00:02:40.910> slide<00:02:41.120> just<00:02:41.590> let<00:02:42.590> go<00:02:42.739> we'll<00:02:43.430> let

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
will let it slide just let go we'll let

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.280 
will let it slide just let go we'll let
it<00:02:43.610> go<00:02:43.820> let<00:02:44.090> us<00:02:44.239> know<00:02:44.360> this<00:02:44.540> this<00:02:44.720> is<00:02:44.930> pretty

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
it go let us know this this is pretty

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.440 
it go let us know this this is pretty
close<00:02:45.530> to<00:02:45.590> cheese<00:02:45.950> I<00:02:46.310> mean<00:02:46.549> really<00:02:46.580> it<00:02:47.299> is

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
close to cheese I mean really it is

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.640 
close to cheese I mean really it is
really<00:02:47.840> it's<00:02:48.110> if<00:02:48.350> it<00:02:49.160> works<00:02:49.370> you're<00:02:49.640> off<00:02:49.820> to<00:02:50.000> a

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
really it's if it works you're off to a

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.100 
really it's if it works you're off to a
an<00:02:51.040> amazing<00:02:52.030> win<00:02:52.209> and<00:02:52.450> if<00:02:52.540> it<00:02:52.659> doesn't<00:02:52.989> then

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
an amazing win and if it doesn't then

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.039 
an amazing win and if it doesn't then
you're<00:02:53.470> basically<00:02:53.590> did<00:02:53.920> yep<00:02:54.760> no<00:02:55.180> that's

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
you're basically did yep no that's

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:59.640 
you're basically did yep no that's
that's<00:02:56.349> it<00:02:56.620> so<00:02:57.400> it<00:02:57.700> looks<00:02:57.730> like<00:02:58.060> matt<00:02:58.780> is<00:02:59.110> going

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
that's it so it looks like matt is going

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.190 
that's it so it looks like matt is going
to<00:02:59.739> beginning<00:03:00.390> possibly<00:03:01.390> an<00:03:01.480> expand<00:03:01.840> he's<00:03:02.019> got

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
to beginning possibly an expand he's got

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.410 
to beginning possibly an expand he's got
an<00:03:02.290> SUV<00:03:02.650> so<00:03:02.860> yeah<00:03:03.040> there<00:03:03.310> it<00:03:03.400> is<00:03:03.489> so<00:03:04.030> he<00:03:04.269> was

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
an SUV so yeah there it is so he was

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.649 
an SUV so yeah there it is so he was
saving<00:03:04.629> up<00:03:04.810> as<00:03:04.959> minerals<00:03:05.319> the<00:03:05.470> expand<00:03:05.860> is<00:03:06.040> down

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:06.659 
saving up as minerals the expand is down

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:10.380 
saving up as minerals the expand is down
or<00:03:07.659> is<00:03:07.959> being<00:03:08.200> built<00:03:08.379> second<00:03:09.250> racks<00:03:09.459> is<00:03:09.849> just

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
or is being built second racks is just

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.509 
or is being built second racks is just
finishing<00:03:10.810> up<00:03:10.900> here<00:03:10.959> format<00:03:11.590> as<00:03:11.769> well<00:03:11.799> that

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
finishing up here format as well that

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:14.759 
finishing up here format as well that
one<00:03:12.849> bunker<00:03:13.359> I<00:03:13.569> don't<00:03:14.290> know<00:03:14.379> if<00:03:14.470> it's<00:03:14.590> going<00:03:14.709> to

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
one bunker I don't know if it's going to

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:17.819 
one bunker I don't know if it's going to
be<00:03:14.920> enough<00:03:15.250> with<00:03:15.879> an<00:03:16.150> all-in<00:03:16.870> of<00:03:17.140> SUVs<00:03:17.799> and

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829 
be enough with an all-in of SUVs and

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:20.880 
be enough with an all-in of SUVs and
Marines<00:03:18.519> unfortunately<00:03:19.450> for<00:03:19.989> evan<00:03:20.140> he<00:03:20.470> got<00:03:20.680> a

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
Marines unfortunately for evan he got a

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.860 
Marines unfortunately for evan he got a
supply<00:03:21.519> block<00:03:21.790> there<00:03:22.030> for<00:03:22.239> a<00:03:22.269> few<00:03:22.480> seconds

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
supply block there for a few seconds

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.869 
supply block there for a few seconds
which<00:03:23.019> is<00:03:23.049> really<00:03:23.409> going<00:03:23.590> to<00:03:23.680> hurt<00:03:23.799> his<00:03:24.310> timing

00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:24.879 
which is really going to hurt his timing

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:26.670 
which is really going to hurt his timing
and<00:03:25.269> obviously<00:03:25.900> the<00:03:26.049> production<00:03:26.470> of<00:03:26.530> the

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
and obviously the production of the

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.649 
and obviously the production of the
marine<00:03:26.920> so<00:03:27.250> that's<00:03:27.760> a<00:03:27.909> little<00:03:28.030> bit<00:03:28.269> of<00:03:28.359> a<00:03:28.420> lucky

00:03:28.649 --> 00:03:28.659 
marine so that's a little bit of a lucky

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:30.780 
marine so that's a little bit of a lucky
break<00:03:28.810> their<00:03:29.079> format<00:03:29.440> and<00:03:29.650> a<00:03:29.950> second<00:03:30.400> bunker

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
break their format and a second bunker

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.530 
break their format and a second bunker
is<00:03:31.569> well<00:03:32.440> on<00:03:32.590> the<00:03:32.620> way<00:03:32.739> now<00:03:33.190> as<00:03:33.549> well<00:03:33.819> format<00:03:34.269> so

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
is well on the way now as well format so

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.960 
is well on the way now as well format so
I'm<00:03:35.439> feeling<00:03:35.709> as<00:03:36.010> though<00:03:36.040> reven<00:03:36.700> is<00:03:36.819> gonna

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
I'm feeling as though reven is gonna

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.390 
I'm feeling as though reven is gonna
shit<00:03:37.120> the<00:03:37.239> bed<00:03:38.189> well<00:03:39.629> he<00:03:40.629> did<00:03:40.780> it<00:03:40.900> once<00:03:41.250> he<00:03:42.250> can

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
shit the bed well he did it once he can

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.179 
shit the bed well he did it once he can
certainly<00:03:42.730> do<00:03:43.180> it<00:03:43.209> again<00:03:43.599> no<00:03:44.530> two<00:03:44.590> ways<00:03:44.920> around

00:03:45.179 --> 00:03:45.189 
certainly do it again no two ways around

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:47.399 
certainly do it again no two ways around
that<00:03:45.430> I<00:03:45.849> I<00:03:46.239> think<00:03:46.689> by<00:03:46.840> the<00:03:46.930> time<00:03:46.959> yeah<00:03:47.379> but

00:03:47.399 --> 00:03:47.409 
that I I think by the time yeah but

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:50.460 
that I I think by the time yeah but
Tommy<00:03:47.769> gets<00:03:47.980> down<00:03:48.129> there<00:03:49.019> Matthias<00:03:50.019> I<00:03:50.290> guess

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
we're gonna go with that yeah with these

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:06.839 
we're gonna go with that yeah with these
but<00:04:05.049> these<00:04:05.139> two<00:04:05.319> bunkers<00:04:05.680> here<00:04:05.919> now<00:04:06.129> yeah

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:06.849 
but these two bunkers here now yeah

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:09.360 
but these two bunkers here now yeah
that's<00:04:07.090> a<00:04:07.209> great<00:04:07.419> number<00:04:07.840> of<00:04:08.019> Marines<00:04:08.799> making

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
that's a great number of Marines making

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.399 
that's a great number of Marines making
her<00:04:09.430> way<00:04:09.519> down<00:04:09.549> with<00:04:09.819> the<00:04:09.909> SCV's<00:04:10.359> I<00:04:10.569> think<00:04:11.349> they

00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:11.409 
her way down with the SCV's I think they

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:13.710 
her way down with the SCV's I think they
could<00:04:11.530> probably<00:04:11.739> get<00:04:11.980> rid<00:04:12.159> of<00:04:12.220> it<00:04:12.400> but<00:04:13.180> he

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
could probably get rid of it but he

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:14.970 
could probably get rid of it but he
might<00:04:13.900> not<00:04:14.049> have<00:04:14.230> enough<00:04:14.379> left<00:04:14.680> over<00:04:14.949> to

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
might not have enough left over to

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.149 
might not have enough left over to
actually<00:04:15.400> accomplish<00:04:15.579> anything<00:04:16.409> yeah<00:04:17.409> um

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:18.159 
actually accomplish anything yeah um

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:20.430 
actually accomplish anything yeah um
well<00:04:18.519> yeah<00:04:18.820> very<00:04:19.120> true<00:04:19.209> I<00:04:19.570> think<00:04:19.900> that<00:04:20.049> that

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
well yeah very true I think that that

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.740 
well yeah very true I think that that
could<00:04:20.470> be<00:04:20.769> the<00:04:20.889> case<00:04:20.919> here<00:04:21.099> if<00:04:21.489> he<00:04:22.180> does<00:04:22.419> the

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
could be the case here if he does the

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.080 
could be the case here if he does the
SUV<00:04:23.289> transfer<00:04:23.889> though<00:04:24.130> always<00:04:24.430> not<00:04:24.729> really<00:04:24.970> is

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
SUV transfer though always not really is

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.450 
SUV transfer though always not really is
that<00:04:25.240> the<00:04:25.449> SUV's<00:04:25.810> to<00:04:25.990> transfer<00:04:26.500> so<00:04:27.010> yeah<00:04:27.400> you

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
that the SUV's to transfer so yeah you

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:28.980 
that the SUV's to transfer so yeah you
know<00:04:27.820> what<00:04:27.909> you<00:04:28.000> might<00:04:28.120> be<00:04:28.180> right<00:04:28.419> he<00:04:28.690> may<00:04:28.930> be

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
know what you might be right he may be

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.110 
know what you might be right he may be
able<00:04:29.229> to<00:04:29.349> break<00:04:29.590> this<00:04:29.770> but<00:04:29.979> I<00:04:30.130> don't<00:04:30.310> know<00:04:30.460> now

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
able to break this but I don't know now

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.740 
able to break this but I don't know now
there's<00:04:31.419> nine<00:04:32.669> Marines<00:04:33.669> in<00:04:33.880> total<00:04:34.270> and<00:04:34.510> there

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
there's nine Marines in total and there

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.779 
there's nine Marines in total and there

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:36.789 
is two SUVs repairing that bunker I

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:38.790 
is two SUVs repairing that bunker I
don't<00:04:37.419> think<00:04:37.720> it's<00:04:37.870> going<00:04:37.990> to<00:04:38.050> be<00:04:38.110> enough<00:04:38.380> nope

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
don't think it's going to be enough nope

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.710 
don't think it's going to be enough nope
now<00:04:39.099> if<00:04:39.430> he<00:04:39.580> had<00:04:39.669> focused<00:04:40.120> the<00:04:40.210> SUV's

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
now if he had focused the SUV's

now if he had focused the SUV's
immediately<00:04:41.380> that<00:04:41.590> probably<00:04:41.979> would<00:04:42.159> have

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
immediately that probably would have

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.300 
immediately that probably would have
been<00:04:42.370> a<00:04:42.400> smart<00:04:42.669> idea<00:04:42.849> but<00:04:43.270> unfortunately<00:04:43.360> no

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
been a smart idea but unfortunately no

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:52.339 
been a smart idea but unfortunately no
no<00:04:45.310> and<00:04:46.150> it<00:04:46.510> is<00:04:46.720> there<00:04:47.440> it<00:04:47.560> is<00:04:47.620> jeez<00:04:48.580> GG<00:04:50.490> revin
