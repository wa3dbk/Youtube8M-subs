of shrimp holes clam holes wormholes you
can<00:02:22.950> see<00:02:23.160> really<00:02:23.400> healthy<00:02:23.819> actuary<00:02:24.450> you<00:02:24.870> got<00:02:25.079> a

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:33.680 
can see really healthy actuary you got a
maybe<00:02:26.340> cockle<00:02:26.850> right<00:02:27.000> here

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.120 

all<00:02:34.690> right<00:02:34.870> so<00:02:34.990> operating<00:02:35.320> a<00:02:35.470> shrimp<00:02:35.770> pump<00:02:35.980> is

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.310 
all right so operating a shrimp pump is
pretty<00:02:36.370> straightforward<00:02:36.700> you<00:02:37.510> just<00:02:37.720> find<00:02:38.230> a

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
pretty straightforward you just find a

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.440 
pretty straightforward you just find a
hole<00:02:38.530> to<00:02:38.560> put<00:02:38.800> it<00:02:38.890> over<00:02:39.040> and<00:02:39.430> pump<00:02:40.300> it<00:02:40.420> back

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
hole to put it over and pump it back

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.540 
hole to put it over and pump it back
you'll<00:02:41.350> hopefully<00:02:41.590> pull<00:02:42.010> out<00:02:42.130> a<00:02:42.190> bunch<00:02:42.430> of

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
you'll hopefully pull out a bunch of

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.550 
you'll hopefully pull out a bunch of
water<00:02:42.760> and<00:02:42.970> sand<00:02:43.780> from<00:02:43.930> the<00:02:44.080> grow<00:02:44.290> with<00:02:44.470> your

there we go shrimps are ready to go
another<00:04:19.079> way<00:04:19.289> the<00:04:19.440> thread<00:04:19.680> shrimp<00:04:20.070> on<00:04:20.310> the

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
another way the thread shrimp on the

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.039 
another way the thread shrimp on the
hook<00:04:20.669> especially<00:04:21.090> if<00:04:21.389> you<00:04:21.449> don't<00:04:21.539> have<00:04:21.690> thread

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
hook especially if you don't have thread

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.570 
hook especially if you don't have thread
is<00:04:22.289> you<00:04:23.099> can<00:04:23.220> go<00:04:23.310> right<00:04:23.729> down<00:04:25.250> there<00:04:26.250> back

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
is you can go right down there back

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.180 
is you can go right down there back
there<00:04:27.030> their<00:04:27.360> body<00:04:27.539> cavity<00:04:28.080> come<00:04:28.949> right<00:04:29.159> out

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
there their body cavity come right out

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.879 
there their body cavity come right out
the<00:04:29.460> back<00:04:29.699> and<00:04:30.060> they<00:04:31.050> hang<00:04:31.260> off<00:04:31.470> the<00:04:31.680> hook

00:04:31.879 --> 00:04:31.889 
the back and they hang off the hook

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:32.990 
the back and they hang off the hook
there<00:04:32.159> and<00:04:32.310> I<00:04:32.340> think<00:04:32.610> that's<00:04:32.760> about<00:04:32.880> the

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
there and I think that's about the

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.700 
there and I think that's about the
strongest<00:04:33.570> point<00:04:33.780> you<00:04:33.870> can<00:04:34.020> put<00:04:34.199> it<00:04:34.260> into<00:04:34.560> him

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
strongest point you can put it into him

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.790 
strongest point you can put it into him
you<00:04:34.830> know<00:04:35.030> is<00:04:36.030> if<00:04:36.960> it's<00:04:37.080> a<00:04:37.169> barbed<00:04:37.409> hook<00:04:37.650> it

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
you know is if it's a barbed hook it

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.439 
you know is if it's a barbed hook it
should<00:04:37.949> be<00:04:38.099> fine<00:04:38.310> if<00:04:38.520> it<00:04:38.610> was<00:04:38.639> a<00:04:38.760> barbless<00:04:39.120> hook

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:39.449 
should be fine if it was a barbless hook

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:40.939 
should be fine if it was a barbless hook
you'd<00:04:39.630> probably<00:04:39.960> slip<00:04:40.169> off<00:04:40.320> with<00:04:40.620> the<00:04:40.710> barbed

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:40.949 
you'd probably slip off with the barbed

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:42.800 
you'd probably slip off with the barbed
that<00:04:41.880> shrimp<00:04:42.090> chin<00:04:42.240> hold<00:04:42.389> on<00:04:42.510> there<00:04:42.690> pretty

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
that shrimp chin hold on there pretty

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.270 
that shrimp chin hold on there pretty
well

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.409 

again<00:04:46.280> with<00:04:46.430> kelp<00:04:46.669> green<00:04:46.879> line<00:04:47.060> in<00:04:47.180> the<00:04:47.240> sand

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419 
again with kelp green line in the sand
