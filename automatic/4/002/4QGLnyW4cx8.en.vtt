00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.240
 wide chili 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.150
 this is the wide chile so it's called 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:26.240
 wide chili 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.240

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:32.470
 we are going to need what is tamarind 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.330
 it's a quarter of tamarind these 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.630
 tamarinds come bare to the 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:40.030
 Peel and rinse thoroughly let 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.549
 need salt 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.460
 oil and water first thing we're going to 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:49.850
 do is going to be put to bake our 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:51.619
 meat with water and salt 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.960
 we are also going to boil the 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:56.270
 tamarind with little water is a quarter of 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.270
 tamarind 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.429
 the tamarinds met and they already 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.380
 turn off now I'm going to let this be 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:05.659
 cool completely when the oil 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.660
 is very hot let's fry the 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:11.750
 chiles but 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:15.980
 when putting the chiles in the oil 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:19.069
 hot the chile tends to inflate 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.799
 and so that it is not going to burst is the 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.840
 When it is used, we give 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:25.890
 Chili a small slot before 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:30.020
 put it 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:32.770
 let's make a slot africa 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:37.750
 so nothing more 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.750
 already with this then the air 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.209
 and we have already done each of the 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:44.209
 chilies 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:51.160
 I already have the golden peppers here and now 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.470
 the garlic and the onion also what with 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.170
 to slow down 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.930
 I'm going to leave here to cool the 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:02.080
 chiles to reveal us and put them to 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:04.600
 soak after having removed the 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.490
 seeds to the chilies rinse them very 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:10.360
 well and they are already soaking themselves with 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:13.600
 enough water now the tamarind as 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.880
 you can either with pressing of 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.310
 the beans or with the hand we are not going to 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.940
 undo very well once you're done 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:24.330
 we will let it go through a 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.330
 strainer 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.219
 two 

00:03:27.219 --> 00:03:30.219
 we go 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:38.050
 good and all this we are going to strain 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:41.710
 after frying the meat and put it on 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:43.750
 It will be spread in a pan with oil that 

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:46.110
 is very hot let's add the 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.060
 meat to prevent 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.400
 once we already have the meat in the 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:54.570
 frying pan we are going to add 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:56.910
 ground pepper little pepper let's go to 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:59.940
 have the silver while the cold 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:02.070
 meat let's grind chiles very well 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.440
 servants softened after 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:07.890
 have them soak in here and I have the 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:10.020
 good tip I'm going to empty it in the 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:13.350
 blender cup together with the 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:15.630
 onion and the two garlic cloves and you 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:18.870
 I'm going to add very little water to 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:21.390
 can grind them so that you can 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.310
 grind I put little water so that it 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.800
 move but still lacks but in 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.410
 Instead of adding water and let 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:31.680
 put a little bit of broth where it was cooked 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.390
 the meat the meat and everything is already the 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.090
 time to turn it off 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:39.240
 the liquefied or milled chili 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:41.670
 of your being with a glass of liquid between 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.490
 broth so the meat was cooked and 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:47.070
 water now let's do now in a 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.860
 we're going to put the court and with 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:53.090
 little bit of the oil where we fry the 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.090
 meats we are going to add 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:05:01.570
 with that post 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:03.400
 my friend Carmen says that also the 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:06.670
 meat can be fried with butter 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.350
 agents of the cbp that is already a decision 

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:11.710
 yours 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:16.070
 I hope the oil is hot and 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:19.300
 let's add what it is 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:19.300
 I say the mills 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:38.270
 and we're going to finish pouring the chile 

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:41.660
 let's add a little more water 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:45.130
 because this 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:45.130
 of the track in the glass of the blender 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:53.800
 then of more or less a glass and a 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:57.090
 quarter of the glass of liquid 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.090
 I do not finish color 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:03.590
 I finished brewing and look here was 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:05.810
 the carrycot this we are going to discard 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:07.820
 with this salt that you add will be 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:10.090
 enough 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:13.090
 and let's wait for it to boil 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:16.560
 to see how we were left with salt 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:18.870
 later add the tamarind 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:21.900
 the chile has already boiled I'm going to 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:24.389
 let four minutes we ignite already pass 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:28.500
 about four minutes of ig letting go 

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:32.780
 seeing the chile already seasoned now let's go 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:32.780
 to add the tamarind pulp 

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:43.820
 and we are going to stir it well 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:47.660
 As soon as I let the boil go, I'll 

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:49.820
 leave another 4 minutes and the 4 

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:52.610
 minutes after I add the pulp 

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:54.840
 of the tamarind and this is already done let's go 

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:58.270
 to add the meat 

00:06:54.840 --> 00:07:01.449
 and you do not like the taste of chiles 

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:03.819
 roasted and you can skip it simply 

00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:07.539
 the edges services good I add the 

00:07:03.819 --> 00:07:11.050
 meat and I leave a minute with the meat 

00:07:07.539 --> 00:07:13.539
 to boil to put it out and the 

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:17.020
 minute and it 's time to turn off and 

00:07:13.539 --> 00:07:20.319
