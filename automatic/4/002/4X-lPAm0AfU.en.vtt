00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:09.830
 today in how it is done we are going to prepare a 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:12.400
 concentrated tomato sauce for pixar 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:17.890
 ok this is the final result 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:20.890
 so we will need a red tomato strained 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:23.990
 we will also need salt oil 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:26.779
 basil I have a little plant then 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.900
 we will take some leaves and oregano a bowl 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.660
 and a colander 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:35.350
 about this bowl and strained we will put in 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:38.620
 first place the tomato and we will proceed to 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.390
 put it inside the colander and with a 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.870
 fork itself a spoon what 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.790
 we have at hand then we can go 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:50.010
 crushing to try to take out all the 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.010
 tomato juice 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.129
 this is the first step because we want 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.890
 that we have a very concentrated sauce 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.440
 when more tasty joint goes 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.600
 to get the final sauce 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.610
 I have crushed I let them go 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.520
 draining 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.970
 meanwhile I'm taking some 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:15.210
 little basil leaves and with a little knife 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.110
 Well, we are cutting these leaves of 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.479
 basil 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.270
 As you can see they are cool they are not 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:25.259
 dry well what will give us a 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:28.190
 very rich aroma to the final sauce and the 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:31.340
 final result for our pizza 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:34.609
 we make these little ones like this 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:37.909
 this does not have much science either 

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:40.990
 I'm going to take one more leaf because I think 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.990
 I do not have a bit left 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:49.460
 very little I'm going to put another little leaf for 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.460
 that has more more aroma to our pizza 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.020
 and we cut 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:03.619
 meanwhile the tomato sauce then 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:07.360
 It is dripping to what is the broth but 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:10.950
 we can continue to help 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.950
 and crushing 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.430
 I repeat when more happy to do more 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.590
 tasty we will stay 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.470
 we are talking about homemade tracks by 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.540
 therefore it does not matter that they remain with 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.320
 much broth to study adding a 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.320
 little bit of oil 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:37.790
 it removes a little bit 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:40.420
 we will also put a little salt a 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.420
 little to taste 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.019
 we will add a bit of oregano 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.840
 and finally we will put the basil 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:57.840
 that we have chopped 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.340
 and we remove 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:16.469
 with a spoon we can always 

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:19.680
 help for the surplus broth the one that goes 

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:23.359
 coming out after you remove and chop it 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.359
 but we will have a little water left 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.360
 what we will do is go little by little 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:31.500
 removing it so that we have a mass 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.500
 pretty concentrated 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.849
 here more or less we have the result 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.849
 final 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:44.730
 can take a portion 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.730
 for my pizza 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:51.530
 and here we see how it has to go 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:54.140
 always fix a little bit and if we 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:57.520
 there is water because we take advantage of the 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.520
 spoon and we remove it 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:04.330
 and here we have a well concentrated mass 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:07.510
 to put it on the base of the pizza and 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:09.550
 we are going to get a very rich pizza very 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:13.950
 Well I hope you like it and that you 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.950
 write to the channel how it is done
