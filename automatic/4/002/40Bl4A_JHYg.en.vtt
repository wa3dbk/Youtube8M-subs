 Celtic states and then the pain 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.790
 Welcome to a video is very fast 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.290

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.120
 take advantage and welcome them to the 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.070
 new section of the channel that obviously 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.200
 will last from here in what comes out 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.119
 0.10 point 0 and as you already realized 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.160
 it is the very similar section 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.840
 obviously the 0.9 point 0 is not 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.660
 will call the first images of 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.189
 minecraft and 0.10 point 0 because good and 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.480
 the creators are working on it 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:30.820
 well it's okay we did not even finish 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.410
 well to enjoy this latest version and 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.480
 they are already working on the next 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.920
 then good carnal in itself the image 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.269
 that they brought us in tomas today 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.739
 here I leave your twitter if you 

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:40.090
 interesting to be following and find out 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:41.360
 of information so as far as 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.610
 out 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.910
 Well simply an image where it says 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:49.010
 that there are already interface improvements and 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.660
 characteristics is like that but that says that 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.400
 they're not very noticeable and that 's where the 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.680
 tweet I'm leaving it and I also 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.180
 left the image then so now yes 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.630
 that like they're improving it now 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.400
 in terms of graphics and stuff not 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.080
 you already your profits and they are 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.000
 exactly the same image I the truth 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.160
 there is not much difference but good if 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.390
 these meats say that it is already 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.190
 changing and others if not better 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.020
 because hopefully if you do not tell them and be 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.450
 At your discretion, it is also said 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.970
 that you can have this better resolution 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.830
 of how much to view but you have to have 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.869
 opinion 3 obviously this is a 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.180
 component is a characteristic of 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:25.580
 devices that not all bring 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.350
 obviously in any way after 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.119
 I bring a video of what's what that is not 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.140
 no reason to not work exactly as 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.780
 it is simply to improve the 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.729
 speakercraft performance speaker so 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.979
 As you know, you have it as a check 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.080
 your device or board 3 we are here 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.399
 below I let them quique but no but 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.110
 well that is a very fast video is 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:43.580
 an image that if someone takes only 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.890
 accept that they do not see much 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.900
 but if there is difference and good 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.520
 now it is the beginning 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.780

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.210
