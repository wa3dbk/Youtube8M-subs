00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.449
 bravo and turnip days so let's go 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:13.550
 let's go nothing special 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:19.130
 practical special meetings no 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.199
 you would have looked, I will make a summary 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.789
 from yesterday's conference of 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:24.380
 microsoft and also from the zitron event in 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.820
 madrid for the presentation I leave you with 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.440
 some images so you can see where 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.560
 where we were was the event 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.560
 today 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.670
 all right 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:27.320
 for a purchase whether it's what you put in 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.490
 yesterday at the xbox conference 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.840
 they were more games more games moving 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.100
 real-time variable potential of the 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.410
 machine that said the forza 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.450
 motorsport 5 this I imagine propose 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.759
 and the ghost 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.490
 it's also set in real time but 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.680
 I did not see a command and move the guy to the 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.439
 time then it did not convince me 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.710
 they say they had 15 titles and 8 of them 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:52.799
 new ips and they showed none and no 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.539
 I know to what extent we are seeing that 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.780
 the project is completely finished 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:59.659
 we know that it will come more or less in 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.159
 November what we do not know is when 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.869
 some of those responsible for microsoft 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.929
 I spoke with the people in charge of Microsoft 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:09.299
 there from here in Spain and well 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:11.280
 they commented that the price does not 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:13.709
 they can say anything but we are going to 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.630
 surprise that yes and of course it's going to 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.459
 be cheaper than playstation 4 or that 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.190
 is what they say they do not know until what 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.920
 point is going to be true this does not but there 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.140
 then I also wanted to comment that 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.819
 the fact that it is spoken of as 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.860
 an entertainment platform more 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.980
 than a game console me 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.739
 does not distrust but to think that 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.019
 maybe they will not also focus on 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:39.540
 other things as it can be what in the 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:41.850
 sponsorship conference of the nfl or 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.310
 the temporary exclusivity at least 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:46.140
 fifa ultimate and that those are great 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.610
 goals and as you know as he has 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.260
 passed on xbox all the content 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.380
 downloadable activision for call 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.620
 of duty comes out first on xbox playstation and 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.300
 this means cachi cachi that are 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.300
 betting on videogames since a 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.980
 thing on the other also there's going to be 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.100
 permanent internet connection what yes 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.680
 it goes better to the best it ends without having the 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.450
 game connected to internet moment to 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.520
 activate it and then your thing is your 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.320
 console is left I do not know how far 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.090
 this is true because they will not talk about 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.800
 topic of course also talk about the 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.050
 power of the machine but with a lot 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.910
 You tell me in numbers I need 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:22.920
 see it in motion because it depends on 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.570
 how then that a very strong machine 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.520
 but we do not have to not have it optimized 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.320
 so I do not care if you have a super 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.480
 computer if you do not know how to use it let's 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:32.490
 optimize what then until not 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.410
 let's see games the movement really does not 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:36.870
 I will be able to make a valuation 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.520
 Of course, as it started to 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.440
 me that about the presentation is how it 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.970
 must present a foam console 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.200
 teaches that console and it's okay and now that 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.480
 there is inside 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.180
 he taught a lot of things and not at the end 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:51.930
 they teach the console not because you stay 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:58.140
 as well as the whole conference and not 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:04:00.569
 you can pay attention you already have the 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:03.630
 teach first point and it's over 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:05.250
 the story well on the other hand what I 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.780
 worry about these conferences is that 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:10.019
 it seems that everything they speak only 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:12.540
 for us type lópez we can see you 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:14.849
 the nba has changed from the legs to the 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.350
 console and all this we saw activation 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:20.280
 real-time very nice very well very 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:22.500
 nice and but it is a spain is not going to 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.240
 can we do not have netflix you 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.610
 they said they are working on it 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.880
 we are working but I to make a 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:32.190
 sponsorship did not say the l the league to 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.870
 bbv to the Spanish league but leave 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:36.180
 see that something adapted to the 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:39.389
 Spanish needs at the nfl level 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:42.030
 that is, the nfl in the USA is the most 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:43.680
 great of the world is the only one not in 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.479
 Spain would be the appropriate links as not 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.920
 they are going to make us extend to the league 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:48.990
 indoor football 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:52.440
 with all due respect now he does not give us the 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.850
 same size then we have to be 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.970
 working with the European league to 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:58.290
 close some sponsorship or some kind of 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.390
 story so that you can see the matches 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:03.210
 in the console which is great for 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:05.070
 to be able to substitute I understand in channel + 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.380
 for example by an xbox which would be 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:11.090
 great guy since you pay the subscription 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:13.890
 gold with your internet connection with 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:15.810
 all download services and other 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:18.090
 and also if you can see matches of 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:20.460
 football or basketball or any other 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.560
 thing I think that is would be a very option 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:25.200
 successful because it would already unify the 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.450
 concepts would mean n no devices 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.950
 have channel + in the play the xbox such 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:31.500
 do you have 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:34.140
 another play or whatever and inside then 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:37.070
 you can watch the movies or you can see 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:37.070
 football 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:43.100
 and other guys design is what 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:46.070
 last that I have left to touch in the 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:48.410
 design is sober risky they have not been 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:50.390
 done more what I say I will look for a 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:52.940
 look like the iplus apparatus very 

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:54.320
 little black so that it happens 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:56.720
 unnoticed in the classroom not so that 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:06:00.190
 call attention red boxing weights but 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:00.190
 well that 's the least 

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:09.830
 the evolution of command is that 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:11.780
 has put the battery inside the remote already 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.730
 so that it stays inside as it happens with 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:16.310
 the play to me gives me many problems 

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:19.010
 xbox batteries the truth was downloaded 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:20.690
 very fast they were not quite right 

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:22.010
 they have never finished convincing 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.050
 I always keep chufa 

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:26.180
 because the battery will run without 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.800
 warn neither pajín and schedule tucked 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.060
 centers but that not used that to 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.920
 improve a little design of the 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:33.710
 joysticks and so with an outside business 

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:36.620
 we are well integrated 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:38.420
 nothing more guys I think that you know 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:41.840
 that all the ghosts that he had 

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:44.150
 second hand it seems that the problem 

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:46.400
 neither to see where rm connection 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:50.350
 permanent to internet and at the moment 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.350
 We know nothing about the price but what is not 

00:06:50.500 --> 00:07:00.050
 it is to what extent this can be true 

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:01.310
 or you can know how much it will cost a thousand 

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:02.750
 four but well I hope that I have 

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:04.870
 liked the video that has served you 

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:09.910
 information and nothing else then if 

00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:09.910
 you can follow the street goodbye videos 

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.270
 two
