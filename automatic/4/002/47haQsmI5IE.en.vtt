the kids thing they go to the cows and

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.590 
the kids thing they go to the cows and
cows<00:04:17.720> of<00:04:18.410> course<00:04:18.769> eat<00:04:18.950> more<00:04:19.160> much<00:04:19.459> more<00:04:19.700> then

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
cows of course eat more much more then

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.020 
cows of course eat more much more then
kids<00:04:20.870> too<00:04:21.079> and<00:04:21.109> if<00:04:21.799> you<00:04:21.979> were<00:04:22.130> a<00:04:22.160> bacon<00:04:22.729> you

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
kids too and if you were a bacon you

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.290 
kids too and if you were a bacon you
could<00:04:23.240> say<00:04:23.450> what<00:04:23.720> a<00:04:23.840> grove<00:04:24.229> of<00:04:24.470> trees<00:04:24.919> and<00:04:25.490> you

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
could say what a grove of trees and you

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.980 
could say what a grove of trees and you
could<00:04:26.510> save<00:04:26.780> water<00:04:27.260> and<00:04:27.889> land<00:04:28.250> and<00:04:28.780> if<00:04:29.780> you<00:04:29.900> are

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
could save water and land and if you are

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.330 
could save water and land and if you are
away<00:04:30.260> and<00:04:30.620> you<00:04:31.280> really<00:04:31.960> conserve<00:04:32.960> resources

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
away and you really conserve resources

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.090 
away and you really conserve resources
and<00:04:34.340> this<00:04:34.880> is<00:04:35.090> therefore<00:04:35.900> it<00:04:35.990> is<00:04:36.139> so<00:04:36.350> huge<00:04:36.710> that

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
and this is therefore it is so huge that

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.860 
and this is therefore it is so huge that
how<00:04:37.639> much<00:04:37.880> you<00:04:38.120> eat<00:04:38.330> affects<00:04:38.510> your

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
how much you eat affects your

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.390 
how much you eat affects your
consciousness<00:04:39.590> and<00:04:39.800> that<00:04:39.889> affects<00:04:40.280> the

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
consciousness and that affects the

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.790 
consciousness and that affects the
healing<00:04:40.789> of<00:04:40.880> the<00:04:40.940> planet<00:04:41.419> so<00:04:42.320> what<00:04:42.500> is<00:04:42.620> good

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
healing of the planet so what is good

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.279 
healing of the planet so what is good
for<00:04:42.950> you<00:04:43.070> is<00:04:43.190> also<00:04:43.490> good<00:04:43.610> for<00:04:43.639> the<00:04:43.910> planet<00:04:44.289> but

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:45.289 
for you is also good for the planet but

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:48.190 
for you is also good for the planet but
