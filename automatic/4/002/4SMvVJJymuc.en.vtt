 [Music] 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.759
 Hello 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:23.929
 today you want to start a cycle of 

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:27.320
 classes dedicated to the use of 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:30.529
 straw basketry methods in the 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:34.100
 basketwork with newspapers with the good 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:36.170
 beginning of richard a famous master of 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.780
 Lithuania that uses in its articles a 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:42.110
 drawing for sale not as an element 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.899
 decorative lately have appeared 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.720
 many jobs like that and in general it's 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:50.570
 justified because the tooth drawing 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:53.570
 It is very beautiful and its use 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:56.330
 certainly decorates an article it 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.850
 today we want to start with the 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:02.390
 drawing tried and then we will use 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.970
 other tissues here are the examples of 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.130
 this is what for now I have had 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.100
 time to do to decorate some 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:15.330
 article you can use tissues like this 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:18.470
 [Music] 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.470
 as a handle 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.790
 for tape 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:31.950
 and as round oval frames 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:35.460
 now we go directly to the drawing 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.760
 tried here is the tempted drawing 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.790
 of a color of your widest here I have 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.840
 tried to do it in two colors besides 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.220
 They are different 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.220
 this speed stripes 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:51.680
 is 4 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:55.450
 well it's the tried drawing we're going 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:59.840
 to stand for one more detail 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:03.080
 tissue of 4 3 and 2 drawing tried here 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:07.180
 this is the most attempted drawing 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.180
 ordinary so-called plastic 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:14.700
 to make it we take two hard 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.540
 [Music] 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.520
 we passed to steam 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.520
 [Music] 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:28.630
 we doubled and now I make two movements 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:31.440
 well from the right one 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:34.420
 we see that two are together in parallel 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:37.510
 and once again from the right 2 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.450
 now we have a figure like that is to say 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:43.270
 the tubes look to the right two 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.910
 little tubes on the left and now promotes 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:49.030
 the far right and I put it below 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:52.930
 and we watch that one lends us to go 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:55.120
 giving together and to the right and in 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.570
 forward they ask us for repeated movements 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:02.500
 I take a little tube left them down to this 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:06.540
 that you're not alone and the end 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:09.490
 left I cross it up parallel 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:12.460
 that line is to say here there is 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:15.070
 select it parallel of two lines and 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:17.520
 now I take two with one hand two with another 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.890
 and as if two would cross 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.360
 and again together our districts 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.670
 they must be together 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:27.420
 the next movement now of the 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:30.380
 right 1 and parallel to this line and 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.880
 I go back to take 2 because I have crossed 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:36.660
 as they taught me once 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:39.210
 this method I'm using one and the 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:43.200
 second 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:46.310
 now we separate two and we put one behind 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:51.020
 of another two together 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:54.610
 2 on the right we have flipped the 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.610
 left 1 2 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:02.010
 we have flipped and put 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.010
 12 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:07.490
 [Music] 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:10.900
 I have turned them apart from the 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:14.210
 left one I put it in parallel 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:18.260
 and this parallel to the line 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:20.660
 horizontal and again two I have flipped and 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:24.530
 we continue knitting like this adding the 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.980
 little tubes we get a drawing in tempted 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.149
 A) Yes 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.149
 [Music] 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:37.430
 if you liked the video press I like it 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.840
 [Music] 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:43.759
