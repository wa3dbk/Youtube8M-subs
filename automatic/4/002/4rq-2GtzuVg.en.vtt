00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:40.830 
we don't suggest that type of

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.430 
we don't suggest that type of
application<00:00:41.699> we<00:00:41.850> suggest<00:00:42.330> that<00:00:42.480> shingles<00:00:43.290> be

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
application we suggest that shingles be

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.049 
application we suggest that shingles be
removed<00:00:43.860> when<00:00:44.190> another<00:00:44.400> shingle<00:00:44.850> roof<00:00:44.970> is

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
removed when another shingle roof is

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.880 
removed when another shingle roof is
going<00:00:45.150> to<00:00:45.239> be<00:00:45.330> put<00:00:45.600> down<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:46.379> can<00:00:46.500> see<00:00:46.710> that

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
going to be put down you can see that

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.219 
going to be put down you can see that
Brown<00:00:47.670> layer<00:00:48.030> down<00:00:48.330> underneath<00:00:48.780> there<00:00:49.080> and

Brown layer down underneath there and

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:51.439 
Brown layer down underneath there and
this<00:00:50.010> other<00:00:50.280> layer<00:00:50.550> here<00:00:50.760> on<00:00:50.909> top<00:00:51.150> so<00:00:51.330> they've

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
this other layer here on top so they've

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.110 
this other layer here on top so they've
got<00:00:51.570> multiple<00:00:51.780> layers<00:00:52.199> on<00:00:52.589> this<00:00:52.769> roof<00:00:53.040> as<00:00:53.820> we

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
got multiple layers on this roof as we

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.939 
got multiple layers on this roof as we
come<00:00:54.690> on<00:00:54.720> that<00:00:55.019> the<00:00:55.110> ladder<00:00:55.350> we<00:00:55.530> can<00:00:55.739> see

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.789 
actually a couple of other issues when
we<00:00:58.379> coop<00:00:58.800> here<00:00:59.040> here's<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.989> bad<00:01:00.989> application

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:01.799 
we coop here here's a bad application

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:04.030 
we coop here here's a bad application

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
the shingles are put on incorrectly a

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.860 
the shingles are put on incorrectly a
lot<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.159> people<00:01:05.430> can<00:01:05.670> recognize<00:01:05.850> this<00:01:06.420> even<00:01:06.780> if

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:06.870 
lot of people can recognize this even if

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.410 
lot of people can recognize this even if
they're<00:01:07.020> not<00:01:07.140> roofers<00:01:07.610> those<00:01:08.610> joints<00:01:09.060> are<00:01:09.180> not

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
they're not roofers those joints are not

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.240 
they're not roofers those joints are not
supposed<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.930> line<00:01:10.110> up<00:01:10.320> that<00:01:10.500> closely<00:01:10.860> they're

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
supposed to line up that closely they're

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.310 
supposed to line up that closely they're
supposed<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.729> be<00:01:11.880> about<00:01:12.150> six<00:01:12.870> inches<00:01:13.140> apart

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
supposed to be about six inches apart

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.690 
supposed to be about six inches apart
and<00:01:13.680> looks<00:01:13.920> like<00:01:14.100> some<00:01:14.310> of<00:01:14.369> them<00:01:14.520> are<00:01:14.610> about

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
and looks like some of them are about

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.510 
and looks like some of them are about
half<00:01:15.119> inch<00:01:15.360> apart<00:01:15.619> so<00:01:16.619> that's<00:01:16.979> not<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.219> good

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
half inch apart so that's not a good

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.639 
half inch apart so that's not a good
application<00:01:18.000> this<00:01:18.719> so<00:01:18.960> he'll<00:01:19.200> have<00:01:19.229> to<00:01:19.619> change

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:19.649 
application this so he'll have to change

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:23.149 
application this so he'll have to change
and<00:01:20.509> looks<00:01:21.509> like<00:01:21.659> some<00:01:21.840> flashing<00:01:22.439> was<00:01:22.710> not<00:01:22.920> put

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
and looks like some flashing was not put

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.760 
and looks like some flashing was not put
in<00:01:23.280> on<00:01:23.430> this<00:01:23.579> wall<00:01:23.840> as<00:01:24.840> we<00:01:24.990> walk<00:01:25.200> over<00:01:25.380> closer

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
in on this wall as we walk over closer

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.389 
in on this wall as we walk over closer
to<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:27.140> you<00:01:28.140> can<00:01:28.320> see<00:01:28.350> there's<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.740> solid<00:01:29.250> piece

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:29.399 
to it you can see there's a solid piece

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:31.069 
to it you can see there's a solid piece
of<00:01:29.640> flashing<00:01:29.850> run<00:01:30.299> on<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.479> cross<00:01:30.750> there

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
of flashing run on the cross there

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.859 
of flashing run on the cross there
that's<00:01:31.680> not<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.280> way<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.490> do<00:01:33.000> a<00:01:33.030> step<00:01:33.420> up<00:01:33.630> like

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
that's not the way to do a step up like

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.529 
that's not the way to do a step up like
that<00:01:34.310> you<00:01:35.310> run<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.490> piece<00:01:35.759> of<00:01:35.969> step<00:01:36.240> flashing

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:36.539 
that you run a piece of step flashing

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:39.440 
that you run a piece of step flashing
with<00:01:37.020> every<00:01:37.409> shingle<00:01:37.680> along<00:01:38.130> that<00:01:38.460> rake<00:01:39.149> right

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
with every shingle along that rake right

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.810 
with every shingle along that rake right
there<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:39.979> then<00:01:40.979> you<00:01:41.100> put<00:01:41.280> run<00:01:41.429> a<00:01:41.460> piece<00:01:41.670> of

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
there and then you put run a piece of

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.700 
there and then you put run a piece of
counter<00:01:42.090> flashing<00:01:42.299> or<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:42.840> drip<00:01:43.259> edge<00:01:43.469> that

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
counter flashing or a drip edge that

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.120 
counter flashing or a drip edge that
covers<00:01:44.009> up<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.189> top<00:01:44.490> edge<00:01:45.229> so<00:01:46.229> walk<00:01:46.409> over<00:01:46.710> here

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
covers up the top edge so walk over here

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.419 
covers up the top edge so walk over here

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:52.179 
have two old skylights these all bubble
skylights<00:01:50.969> we<00:01:51.240> don't<00:01:51.420> use<00:01:51.659> these<00:01:51.929> anymore

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
skylights we don't use these anymore

stop<00:01:53.189> using<00:01:53.460> those<00:01:53.820> over<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.869> decade<00:01:55.350> ago<00:01:55.499> but

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
stop using those over a decade ago but

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.520 
stop using those over a decade ago but
this<00:01:56.670> is<00:01:56.789> a<00:01:56.820> holdover<00:01:57.270> looks<00:01:58.049> like<00:01:58.170> they<00:01:58.289> tried

roof is re-roofed I don't have to be
changed<00:02:48.280> and<00:02:48.880> this<00:02:49.000> over<00:02:49.240> here<00:02:49.330> is<00:02:49.480> very

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840

here too you have some rotted plywood
under<00:02:54.190> here<00:02:54.430> they'll<00:02:55.300> have<00:02:55.480> to<00:02:55.600> be<00:02:55.720> changed

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
under here they'll have to be changed

general<00:02:57.970> condition<00:02:58.480> of<00:02:58.540> the<00:02:58.660> shingles<00:02:59.110> here

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
general condition of the shingles here

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:02.370 
general condition of the shingles here
is<00:02:59.530> is<00:03:00.000> it's<00:03:01.000> on<00:03:01.210> the<00:03:01.330> low<00:03:01.540> side<00:03:01.840> I'm<00:03:02.050> gonna<00:03:02.230> say

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
is is it's on the low side I'm gonna say

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.680 
is is it's on the low side I'm gonna say
it's<00:03:02.560> probably<00:03:02.800> poor<00:03:03.510> it's<00:03:04.510> not

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
it's probably poor it's not

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.870 
it's probably poor it's not
devastatingly<00:03:05.500> poor<00:03:05.980> but<00:03:06.220> it's<00:03:06.370> just<00:03:06.610> poor

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
devastatingly poor but it's just poor

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.790 
devastatingly poor but it's just poor
because<00:03:07.210> you<00:03:07.300> can<00:03:07.480> maybe<00:03:08.170> you<00:03:08.320> can<00:03:08.530> see

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
because you can maybe you can see

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.330 
because you can maybe you can see
granules<00:03:09.430> missing<00:03:10.500> in<00:03:11.500> some<00:03:11.770> little<00:03:11.980> small

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
granules missing in some little small

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.750 
granules missing in some little small
areas<00:03:12.880> there<00:03:13.180> this<00:03:13.840> stained<00:03:14.710> uh<00:03:14.860> staining<00:03:15.670> of

areas there this stained uh staining of
a<00:03:15.910> roof<00:03:16.150> doesn't<00:03:16.600> necessarily<00:03:18.180> cause<00:03:19.180> the

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
a roof doesn't necessarily cause the

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:21.270 
a roof doesn't necessarily cause the
death<00:03:19.720> of<00:03:19.930> a<00:03:20.050> roof<00:03:20.290> that<00:03:20.320> indicates<00:03:21.070> that

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
death of a roof that indicates that

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.090 
death of a roof that indicates that
there's<00:03:21.990> mildew<00:03:22.990> buildup<00:03:23.200> up<00:03:23.680> here<00:03:23.920> which

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
there's mildew buildup up here which

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.480 
there's mildew buildup up here which
doesn't<00:03:24.610> terminate<00:03:25.270> the<00:03:25.630> roof<00:03:25.870> this<00:03:26.740> makes<00:03:27.280> it

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:27.490 
doesn't terminate the roof this makes it

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:29.970 
doesn't terminate the roof this makes it
aesthetically<00:03:28.060> unpleasing<00:03:28.870> over<00:03:29.560> here<00:03:29.800> looks

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
aesthetically unpleasing over here looks

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.610 
aesthetically unpleasing over here looks
like<00:03:30.070> there<00:03:30.310> was<00:03:30.430> a<00:03:30.460> repair<00:03:30.940> done<00:03:31.260> you<00:03:32.260> can<00:03:32.410> see

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
like there was a repair done you can see

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:33.930 
like there was a repair done you can see
the<00:03:32.740> new<00:03:32.890> shingles<00:03:33.340> that<00:03:33.460> were<00:03:33.550> put<00:03:33.790> in

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
the new shingles that were put in

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.390 
the new shingles that were put in
there's<00:03:34.180> a<00:03:34.240> ribbon<00:03:34.570> right<00:03:34.750> there<00:03:34.960> the<00:03:35.110> edge

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
there's a ribbon right there the edge

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.440 
there's a ribbon right there the edge
looks<00:03:36.400> like<00:03:36.580> where<00:03:36.790> they<00:03:36.880> stopped<00:03:37.240> their

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
looks like where they stopped their

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.930 
looks like where they stopped their
repair<00:03:37.900> there<00:03:38.740> was<00:03:38.920> more<00:03:39.190> problem<00:03:39.700> there

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
repair there was more problem there

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.690 
repair there was more problem there
maybe<00:03:40.720> they<00:03:40.960> just<00:03:41.140> didn't<00:03:41.500> make<00:03:41.620> a<00:03:41.680> good<00:03:42.430> time

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
maybe they just didn't make a good time

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.460 
maybe they just didn't make a good time
or<00:03:43.060> maybe<00:03:43.240> it<00:03:43.390> was<00:03:43.480> hard<00:03:43.690> to<00:03:43.840> make<00:03:43.960> that<00:03:44.140> time

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
or maybe it was hard to make that time

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.130 
or maybe it was hard to make that time
it<00:03:45.340> looks<00:03:45.520> like<00:03:45.670> there's<00:03:45.850> some<00:03:46.000> more<00:03:46.180> soft

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
it looks like there's some more soft

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.670 
it looks like there's some more soft
plywood<00:03:47.770> yeah<00:03:48.750> soft<00:03:49.750> plywood<00:03:50.230> there<00:03:50.440> so

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
plywood yeah soft plywood there so
