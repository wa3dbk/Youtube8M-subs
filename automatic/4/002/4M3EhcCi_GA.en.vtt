00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 hello girls i come back today 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:04.830
 in a new video this time 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.280
 I decided to do a review on the 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.290
 pallet the basic team had to claim 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.880
 a team basics even forgiveness of urban 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.740
 decay so in fact it's all 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.260
 last pallet that is part of the 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:20.189
 range lake is to say the sgam nude 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.080
 of indicated hub so I got this 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.060
 small palette already there is already 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.920
 two weeks but I completely 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.400
 forgot to do a review on this 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.630
 planet 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.689
 while frankly she is really 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.820
 awesome I think now she's 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.940
 available in your sephora me I have 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.320
 brought from canada i had a friend who 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.430
 leave for canada as long as he could 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:48.690
 firm brought it down so absolute and I 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:50.789
 paid 22 25 25 or 26 euros so I 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.719
 believe it's the price it costs in 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.910
 France I believe it is in the 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.649
 same in the same prices so that's it 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.270
 so this girl very small palette 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.289
 who hold on here you see attracts 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.199
 really in the hand she is all 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.390
 small she is pretty hard plastic 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.070
 it's plastic m2 I think you 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.799
 plastic to a good quality because 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.689
 he's really nice he's not that 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.860
 not seem to be winning what like 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:16.200
 we say what can I tell you 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.689
 on it so it's a ride that is 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.090
 available in all efforts to whom 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.049
 sell the mark urban decay so I 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.280
 will show you how these loans 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.380
 world inside so inside 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.369
 you have a big mirror that's just 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.409
 here that is really not bad we see 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.790
 really not bad so he's fine 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.530
 what is good is that in fact you 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.600
 can really one crime and when you 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.729
 want the flat break pallet 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.560
 finally be laid flat on a 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.509
 surface can really a criminal mirror 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.579
 so that the palette hold 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.290
 good and it's still pretty stable 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.600
 when you ask it so she is 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.250
 composed of six lighthouse so I do not know 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.590
 if the brightness will allow us to see it 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.130
 very well it is composed of six fars 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.259
 you have 5 lighthouse matt completely 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.270
 match in this palette is a lighthouse 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.270
 who's just this one here who's a 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.480
 lighthouse satin it is not totally iridescent 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.009
 and rather satin 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.970
 here I am makeup today 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.300
 with this palette 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.160
 I used a tattoo collector 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.600
 maybelline in base so it's a good lot 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.580
 to all of bronze color and after I 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.660
 used only this palette and you 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.700
 see that we can make makeup 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.750
 really super nice we can stay in 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.220
 something neutral 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.870
 we can also pass on some 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.510
 more loaded thing so rather a 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.950
 smoky with these two colors there and a 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.390
 other after using the others 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.850
 colors there for example I used the 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.260
 black as a liner that I have not bad 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.390
 faded to do something rather 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.850
 diffuse and you see that's not too much 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.739
 load no more so here I am 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.780
 completely conquered by this palette 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:46.140
 because I think it's really 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.520
 basics you need to have in 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.020
 the more she is tiny is of very 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:53.280
 well and when you leave 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:54.420
 weekend it will be super convenient and that's it 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.540
 so I am completely conquered 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:00.000
 in addition for the price frankly 25 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.320
 I think I think it's 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.450
 is still largely because the 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.570
 lighthouses urban decay they have nothing left to 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.400
 prove these are excellent lighthouses 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:10.260
 slightly powdery for some but 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.360
 still it's very good 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.900
 fars the diet is completely 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.660
 crazy 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.580
 and even if they are lighthouses matt you 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.230
 can still good but work 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.730
 and to some farmad who are very 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.040
 hard to work that fades 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.780
 not and if you put a little 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.209
 little too much it's going to be a hassle to 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.950
 fade to work while that 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.180
 you can not go back too much 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.170
 given these are colors that 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.560
 are neutral 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:37.080
 so they are not necessarily overloaded 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.630
 we will say or too visible but you 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.010
 can not go wrong I think at the 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.200
 dosage level even if you invite 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.900
 many they are six aces to I arrive 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.299
 more to speak it stops it fades very 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.920
 well and here is you really getting 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.370
 do something nice with this 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.370
 palette 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.560
 so I think I 'll introduce you 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.000
 the lighthouses a parent even though my camera 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.150
 does not focus so it may be 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.980
 a little difficult let's start I'm going 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.730
 zoom and a little bit what does the 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.290
 palette so 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.670
 more closely you see that there is already 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.379
 lighthouses that are a little bit dug 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.000
 because I have not misused 

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:10.530
 so I will make you whatever 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.239
 on the fingers for that is a lot 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.980
 more accurate for you 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:16.169
 I start with the very first who 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.239
 is called come and go in fact it's 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.900
 the far the only lighthouse kg and satin of 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.019
 this palette 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:24.120
 it's an iridescent white so with 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.889
 rather beige reflections that can very well 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.720
 be worn as an highlights or then 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:29.010
 it may well cover the entire 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.280
 small eyelid island to illuminate 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:36.210
 your your look then there is foxy 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:38.490
 and foxy it's a strong match 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.530
 I'm sorry I'm not very flexible 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.660
 at the level of the decorations it is a lighthouse nat 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.310
 who hold a little bit on the young 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.260
 in fact you have two flagship matt so 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.610
 the two who are here are one who pulls 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.100
 more about the young so that's the one that 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:53.310
 I have on my finger and at price you have w 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.840
 so it's walk of shame 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.030
 rather pink and I do not know if you 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.470
 will see well the difference to the camera there 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.240
 there is one who is rather young and locke 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.440
 is rather pink and it stays all 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.360
 two of the pharmacies that are really 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.479
 very very pretty then you go the 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:09.150
 make team 2 which is a beacon 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:11.370
 on my little finger and in fact it's a 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:14.370
 lighthouse flesh-colored but it's a 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:16.229
 pretty clear sheikh that lets you 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:18.270
 define more precisely a hollow of 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:19.800
 eyelids or so just wanted 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.820
 apply on a mobile eyelid for 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.250
 to unify your eyelid 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:25.020
 he is really super pretty this one and 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:28.200
 here I really like a lot 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:31.139
 so then you did one you are 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.910
 fights and brown means so who shoots 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:34.320
 a little bit about gray are some 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.030
 corridors that shoot wines are 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.400
 cold tones are not warm tones 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.570
 and this one is really sublime wolfe 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.370
 This is one of my favorites 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.690
 I can very well apply alone on 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.669
 the eyelid because I find that on 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:45.900
 the brown eyes it is beautiful I 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:47.940
 think about green eyes he has to 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:50.520
 to be terrible too and here is a 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:53.789
 back very nice and then you with 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:56.490
 rain is so betrayed it's a black so 

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:59.160
 a matte black always so I find that 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.570
 pigmentation side it's not bad but he 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.080
 is not as pigmented as the lighthouse 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:04.569
 blackout that we could find 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:06.400
 but what number 2 I find it is 

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:08.439
 a lot more windy it's a nice black 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.800
 but has also pigmented that of the 

00:06:08.439 --> 00:06:10.030
 carrot 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.280
 so I have the impression that they are 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:13.479
 a little bit of a hole in their 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.129
 beautiful voices there for the presentation of 

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:16.659
 farges you the effects a little bit more 

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:19.419
 I think I'll make you 

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:20.710
 also swatch on my arm and I 

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:21.789
 you will take pictures that I would put 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:23.710
 not what I will surely create a 

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:24.969
 article also on my blog for that 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:26.289
 it's more accurate because I have 

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:27.849
 the impression that on the camera I'm not 

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:29.500
 sure we can see I have only 

00:06:27.849 --> 00:06:31.270
 the cameras back which I'm not sure 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:33.580
 that it did well the focus and it's 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:36.069
 so this palette is everything 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.900
 simply divine more than I love 

00:06:36.069 --> 00:06:39.190
 it's actually we can do really 

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.719
 all you want with this palette 

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:42.580
 not this cape since you have a 

00:06:40.719 --> 00:06:45.009
 black blush you can intensify all 

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:47.110
 the colors of this palette you 

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:48.729
 can I repeat it I think you 

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:50.560
 can do something very 

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:52.180
 neutral so with very clear headlights 

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.529
 so something bright and 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:57.039
 'neutral' and what you can do 

00:06:53.529 --> 00:06:58.719
 really something darker than a 

00:06:57.039 --> 00:07:00.669
 kind of that moment that things like 

00:06:58.719 --> 00:07:03.400
 that can be really very very 

00:07:00.669 --> 00:07:04.629
 very pretty here so I think this 

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.940
