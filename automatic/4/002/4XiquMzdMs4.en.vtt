00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
to be struggled no pool for any crap in

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.870 
to be struggled no pool for any crap in
EBS<00:02:41.420> that<00:02:42.320> they<00:02:42.530> possibly<00:02:42.890> can<00:02:43.100> and<00:02:43.340> invent

so

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.740 

takes<00:02:55.430> too<00:02:55.550> much<00:02:55.700> time<00:02:55.760> for<00:02:56.090> that<00:02:56.240> I<00:02:56.450> mean<00:02:56.720> I

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
takes too much time for that I mean I

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.890 
takes too much time for that I mean I
you<00:02:57.050> know<00:02:57.140> it's<00:02:57.530> tough<00:02:57.710> to<00:02:58.300> gauge<00:02:59.300> when<00:02:59.810> the

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
you know it's tough to gauge when the

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.350 
you know it's tough to gauge when the
season<00:03:00.170> is<00:03:00.230> going<00:03:00.350> to<00:03:00.440> start<00:03:00.620> and<00:03:01.180> be<00:03:02.180> able<00:03:02.270> to

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
season is going to start and be able to

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.360 
season is going to start and be able to
kind<00:03:02.570> of<00:03:02.630> gamble<00:03:03.530> with<00:03:03.800> that<00:03:03.950> and<00:03:04.160> doing<00:03:04.280> that

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
kind of gamble with that and doing that

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:17.220 
kind of gamble with that and doing that
procedure<00:03:04.730> and<00:03:04.970> take<00:03:05.510> a<00:03:05.540> little<00:03:05.690> too<00:03:05.840> much

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:19.840 

what

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
what

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.130 
what
now<00:03:20.850> we<00:03:20.910> knew<00:03:21.150> each<00:03:21.180> other<00:03:21.560> we<00:03:22.560> knew<00:03:22.680> we<00:03:22.710> stunk

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140 
now we knew each other we knew we stunk

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.390 
now we knew each other we knew we stunk
knew<00:03:25.140> that<00:03:25.470> we<00:03:25.800> knew<00:03:25.950> that<00:03:27.680> no<00:03:28.680> I<00:03:28.710> don't<00:03:29.340> think

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
knew that we knew that no I don't think

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.920 
knew that we knew that no I don't think
it's<00:03:29.730> it's<00:03:31.550> you<00:03:32.550> know<00:03:32.640> Powell<00:03:32.940> is<00:03:33.390> a<00:03:33.540> very

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
it's it's you know Powell is a very

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.980 
it's it's you know Powell is a very
emotional<00:03:34.170> guy<00:03:34.530> you<00:03:35.370> know<00:03:35.490> and<00:03:35.760> I<00:03:36.740> think<00:03:37.740> he's

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:38.990 
emotional guy you know and I think he's

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:42.260 
emotional guy you know and I think he's
when<00:03:39.990> things<00:03:40.260> go<00:03:40.500> bad<00:03:40.530> from<00:03:40.950> the<00:03:41.270> things

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.270 
when things go bad from the things

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.590 
when things go bad from the things
really<00:03:42.480> go<00:03:42.690> back<00:03:42.900> from<00:03:43.140> his<00:03:43.650> eyes<00:03:44.240> so<00:03:45.240> I<00:03:45.270> think

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
really go back from his eyes so I think

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.350 
really go back from his eyes so I think
that<00:03:45.780> common<00:03:46.260> is<00:03:46.410> it's<00:03:46.860> not<00:03:47.030> like<00:03:48.030> we<00:03:48.150> didn't

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
that common is it's not like we didn't

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.760 
that common is it's not like we didn't
know<00:03:48.480> each<00:03:48.510> other<00:03:48.750> we<00:03:49.110> weren't<00:03:49.350> playing<00:03:49.470> well
