00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
performance of a general laptop kind of

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.160 
performance of a general laptop kind of
like<00:00:38.700> an<00:00:38.760> older<00:00:39.090> laptop<00:00:39.239> that's<00:00:39.809> still<00:00:39.989> pretty

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
like an older laptop that's still pretty

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.869 
like an older laptop that's still pretty
decent<00:00:40.710> for<00:00:40.770> surfing<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.309> web<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.670> looking

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
decent for surfing the web and looking

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.270 
decent for surfing the web and looking
at<00:00:41.969> videos<00:00:42.300> it's<00:00:42.989> not<00:00:43.200> quite<00:00:43.469> as<00:00:43.620> slow<00:00:43.980> as<00:00:44.010> an

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
at videos it's not quite as slow as an

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.279 
at videos it's not quite as slow as an
atom<00:00:44.579> which<00:00:44.730> is<00:00:44.879> like<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.239> really<00:00:45.690> old<00:00:45.840> laptop

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
atom which is like a really old laptop

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.660 
atom which is like a really old laptop
that<00:00:46.469> you<00:00:46.649> can't<00:00:46.920> really<00:00:47.160> do<00:00:47.280> everything<00:00:47.579> you

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
that you can't really do everything you

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.430 
that you can't really do everything you
want<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.940> do<00:00:48.030> on<00:00:48.149> it<00:00:48.180> but<00:00:48.899> it<00:00:49.079> gives<00:00:49.170> you<00:00:49.320> the

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
want to do on it but it gives you the

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.770 
want to do on it but it gives you the
size<00:00:49.710> of<00:00:50.039> almost<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:50.940> netbook<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.449> it's<00:00:51.660> just

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
size of almost a netbook and it's just

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.200 
size of almost a netbook and it's just
slightly<00:00:52.170> bit<00:00:52.410> bigger<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:52.860> that's<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.579> big<00:00:53.940> big

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
slightly bit bigger and that's a big big

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.400 
slightly bit bigger and that's a big big
plus<00:00:54.510> now<00:00:54.719> here's<00:00:54.960> what<00:00:55.079> makes<00:00:55.199> this<00:00:55.289> thing

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
plus now here's what makes this thing

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.920 
plus now here's what makes this thing
really<00:00:55.590> cool<00:00:55.890> number<00:00:56.460> one<00:00:56.670> is<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.910> CPU<00:00:57.690> it's<00:00:57.870> a

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
really cool number one is the CPU it's a

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.599 
really cool number one is the CPU it's a
little<00:00:58.230> bit<00:00:58.320> faster<00:00:58.469> number<00:00:58.949> two<00:00:59.129> is<00:00:59.370> the

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
little bit faster number two is the

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.549 
little bit faster number two is the
graphics<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.329> resolution<00:01:01.260> which<00:01:01.350> means

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
graphics and the resolution which means

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.380 
graphics and the resolution which means
you<00:01:01.649> can<00:01:01.770> do<00:01:01.829> HD<00:01:02.219> video<00:01:02.460> on<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.789> screen<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.270> it

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
you can do HD video on the screen and it

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.570 
you can do HD video on the screen and it
has<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.660> horsepower<00:01:04.140> inside<00:01:04.589> graphically<00:01:05.159> to

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
has the horsepower inside graphically to

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.730 
has the horsepower inside graphically to
actually<00:01:05.939> produce<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.510> render<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.930> 1080p<00:01:07.409> file

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
actually produce and render a 1080p file

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.000 
actually produce and render a 1080p file
out<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.100> TV<00:01:08.280> or<00:01:08.640> 720p<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:10.020> this<00:01:10.170> display<00:01:10.530> and

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
out to a TV or 720p to this display and

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.980 
out to a TV or 720p to this display and
then<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.580> final<00:01:11.729> really<00:01:12.510> really<00:01:12.720> impressive

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
then the final really really impressive

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.170 
then the final really really impressive
thing<00:01:13.200> about<00:01:13.229> this<00:01:13.470> laptop<00:01:13.680> is<00:01:13.979> its<00:01:14.520> battery

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
thing about this laptop is its battery

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.390 
thing about this laptop is its battery
life<00:01:15.330> as<00:01:15.479> an<00:01:15.600> incredibly<00:01:16.140> big<00:01:16.350> battery<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:17.280> it

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
life as an incredibly big battery and it

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.719 
life as an incredibly big battery and it
will<00:01:17.640> go<00:01:17.820> for<00:01:18.000> hours<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.659> hours<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.049> hours

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
will go for hours and hours and hours

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.219 
will go for hours and hours and hours
just<00:01:20.729> on<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:20.970> single<00:01:21.479> charge<00:01:21.689> so<00:01:21.900> it's<00:01:22.020> almost

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
just on a single charge so it's almost

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.219 
just on a single charge so it's almost
all<00:01:22.770> day<00:01:22.950> computing<00:01:23.460> now<00:01:24.270> I've<00:01:24.479> used<00:01:24.869> in<00:01:25.170> the

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
all day computing now I've used in the

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.870 
all day computing now I've used in the
past<00:01:25.290> and<00:01:25.830> I've<00:01:26.130> done<00:01:26.400> different

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
past and I've done different

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.580 
past and I've done different
configurations<00:01:27.479> of<00:01:27.570> this<00:01:27.780> same<00:01:27.990> 1410

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
configurations of this same 1410

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.289 
configurations of this same 1410
timeline<00:01:29.009> done<00:01:29.130> reviews<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.670> when<00:01:30.000> I<00:01:30.060> played

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
timeline done reviews and when I played

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.420 
timeline done reviews and when I played
with<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.630> day<00:01:30.720> before<00:01:30.770> it<00:01:31.770> just<00:01:32.040> literally

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
with it the day before it just literally

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.280 
with it the day before it just literally
would<00:01:32.700> go<00:01:32.880> all<00:01:33.150> day<00:01:33.420> maybe<00:01:33.600> like<00:01:33.780> six<00:01:34.140> hours

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
would go all day maybe like six hours

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.530 
would go all day maybe like six hours
seven<00:01:34.890> hours<00:01:35.189> on<00:01:35.369> one<00:01:35.850> battery<00:01:36.210> charge<00:01:36.420> if

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
seven hours on one battery charge if

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.130 
finally in the back here your 10 100

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.519 
finally in the back here your 10 100
1000<00:05:43.759> Ethernet<00:05:44.599> port<00:05:44.870> it's<00:05:44.990> also<00:05:45.169> important

00:05:45.519 --> 00:05:45.529 
1000 Ethernet port it's also important

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:46.870 
1000 Ethernet port it's also important
to<00:05:45.590> note<00:05:45.740> that<00:05:45.770> as<00:05:46.069> far<00:05:46.190> as<00:05:46.250> an<00:05:46.370> activity<00:05:46.580> goes

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:46.880 
to note that as far as an activity goes

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.839 
to note that as far as an activity goes
this<00:05:47.060> also<00:05:47.330> does<00:05:47.840> support<00:05:48.259> n<00:05:49.069> draft<00:05:49.430> wireless

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:49.849 
this also does support n draft wireless

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:53.499 
this also does support n draft wireless
so<00:05:49.940> you<00:05:50.000> do<00:05:50.120> have<00:05:50.270> the<00:05:50.479> highest<00:05:51.460> highest<00:05:52.509> spec

00:05:53.499 --> 00:05:53.509 
so you do have the highest highest spec

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:55.089 
so you do have the highest highest spec
for<00:05:53.810> wireless<00:05:54.199> a<00:05:54.259> three<00:05:54.560> hundred<00:05:54.620> megabyte

00:05:55.089 --> 00:05:55.099 
for wireless a three hundred megabyte

00:05:55.099 --> 00:05:57.369 
for wireless a three hundred megabyte
per<00:05:55.279> second<00:05:55.669> multiple<00:05:56.539> multiple<00:05:56.690> also<00:05:57.169> very

00:05:57.369 --> 00:05:57.379 
per second multiple multiple also very

00:05:57.379 --> 00:05:58.629 
per second multiple multiple also very
fast<00:05:57.620> if<00:05:57.770> you've<00:05:57.860> an<00:05:57.949> end<00:05:58.069> draft<00:05:58.250> router<00:05:58.430> home

00:05:58.629 --> 00:05:58.639 
fast if you've an end draft router home

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:01.059 
fast if you've an end draft router home
that<00:05:58.789> means<00:05:58.940> you<00:05:59.000> can<00:05:59.270> stream<00:05:59.840> HD<00:06:00.319> stuff<00:06:00.889> to

00:06:01.059 --> 00:06:01.069 
that means you can stream HD stuff to

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:02.589 
that means you can stream HD stuff to
this<00:06:01.190> thing<00:06:01.400> and<00:06:01.490> it<00:06:01.580> will<00:06:01.699> play<00:06:01.940> the<00:06:02.150> HD<00:06:02.449> stuff

00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:02.599 
this thing and it will play the HD stuff
