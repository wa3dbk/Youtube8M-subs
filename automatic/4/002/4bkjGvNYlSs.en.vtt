00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.980 
looking forward to Resident Evil 6 too
much<00:01:22.649> considering<00:01:23.069> what<00:01:23.429> the<00:01:23.580> game<00:01:23.990> game

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
much considering what the game game

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.109 
much considering what the game game
plays<00:01:25.259> like<00:01:25.289> and<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.039> story<00:01:26.340> looks<00:01:26.670> alright

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
plays like and the story looks alright

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.320 
plays like and the story looks alright
but<00:01:27.179> I'm<00:01:27.630> not<00:01:27.750> that<00:01:27.959> excited<00:01:28.259> for<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:29.330> although

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
but I'm not that excited for it although

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.499 
but I'm not that excited for it although
we<00:01:30.450> do<00:01:30.660> get<00:01:30.869> a<00:01:31.050> ADA<00:01:31.459> scenario<00:01:32.459> after<00:01:32.789> we<00:01:33.330> beat

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
we do get a ADA scenario after we beat

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.150 
we do get a ADA scenario after we beat
the<00:01:33.660> game<00:01:33.690> so<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:34.200> is<00:01:34.590> definitely<00:01:34.979> something

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.160 
the game so that is definitely something

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.370 
the game so that is definitely something
that<00:01:35.340> I'm<00:01:35.550> looking<00:01:35.700> forward<00:01:36.119> to<00:01:36.239> and<00:01:36.509> the

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:39.539 
replay value and the mercenaries mode

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:41.680 
replay value and the mercenaries mode

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:54.250 
like in an era - deletion and even for

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:57.840 
like in an era - deletion and even for
NECA<00:06:54.460> that's<00:06:55.710> that's<00:06:56.710> it's<00:06:57.070> kind<00:06:57.280> of<00:06:57.370> bad<00:06:57.640> at

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:57.850 
NECA that's that's it's kind of bad at

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:59.040 
NECA that's that's it's kind of bad at
the<00:06:57.940> same<00:06:57.970> time<00:06:58.270> can't<00:06:58.450> really<00:06:58.600> judge<00:06:58.840> too

00:06:59.040 --> 00:06:59.050 
the same time can't really judge too

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:00.720 
the same time can't really judge too
much<00:06:59.200> because<00:06:59.440> this<00:06:59.560> is<00:06:59.740> one<00:07:00.040> of<00:07:00.070> the<00:07:00.340> earlier

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:00.730 
much because this is one of the earlier

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:03.210 
much because this is one of the earlier
figures<00:07:01.120> that<00:07:01.270> they<00:07:01.360> came<00:07:01.540> out<00:07:01.690> with<00:07:01.900> I<00:07:02.220> think

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:03.220 
figures that they came out with I think

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:04.350 
figures that they came out with I think
this<00:07:03.460> is<00:07:03.580> before<00:07:03.730> the<00:07:04.000> tenth<00:07:04.210> anniversary

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:04.360 
this is before the tenth anniversary

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.180 
this is before the tenth anniversary
risen<00:07:05.080> the<00:07:05.170> old<00:07:05.320> figures<00:07:05.620> if<00:07:05.800> I<00:07:05.890> remember
