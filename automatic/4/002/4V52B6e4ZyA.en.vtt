00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.980
 about 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.679
 about 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:21.020
 I greet all viewers of this video in 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:24.080
 This video is about tables 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:26.200
 satellite frequencies where you can watch 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:31.010
 new data 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:33.350
 new transport their parameters in 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:39.230
 In particular, there is such a service links at 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:47.350
 type links at go to the link to 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:53.180
 site links at and here in the first table 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:55.910
 is data transporters if 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:59.540
 interested in 36 degrees click on europe 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:03.260
 if 75 satellite ps2 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:05.229
 Clicking on Asia, let's take the example of ps2 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:10.149
 consider in more detail 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:14.119
 what data is present in the tables 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:14.960
 Initially , the C data comes first 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:18.670
 range 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:22.310
 transponders further goes ku-range 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.500
 his example in more detail 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:29.240
 dwell on the tables in the first 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:33.979
 column posted purity 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.599
 transporter and polarization second 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:37.670
 column 

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:42.800
 channel name 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:45.289
 provider if you click the name 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.860
 channel go to the page which 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:52.250
 there is data on what other satellite 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:55.610
 broadcast this channel by clicking on 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:02:00.260
 logo we fall 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:02.750
 I apologize for the official clicking under 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:06.730
 logo on the link we get to 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.730
 the official website of the channel 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:11.170
 go back 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:20.810
 Next comes the standard in this column. 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.910
 broadcast conveyor standard 2 for 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:27.590
 TV satellite users 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:30.700
 yerbyab 2 does not require if you have a receiver 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:33.550
 supports standard only 9 s 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:38.150
 respectively gps two standard 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:40.610
 transporter and channels like go with this 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:41.890
 transporter will not be available to us 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.890
 view 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:49.040
 and still there is a situation may be 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:53.330
 some users noticed when 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:56.900
 channel turn to black picture 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:59.360
 no image but only the sound goes it 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:03.730
 due to the fact that your receiver 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.730
 supports standards vibe is a 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:13.900
 video decoded mp4 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.900
 You see Russia is written 1 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:21.830
 video format goes to mp4 if you have 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:26.010
 was dvb s2 receiver supported standard 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:28.370
 this channel would be available and so it is for 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:33.270
 unfortunately you are not available 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:35.850
 if in front of the channel we see the letter f it 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.110
 means that the channel is free 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:41.880
 Access ft 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:45.660
 not coded opposite channels which 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:48.620
 come in high definition written 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:53.390
 hd sport 1 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:56.790
 he goes away as 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:58.820
 still there is a situation like this can 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:02.970
 get caught 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:04.650
 the information in this column is next 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:11.690
 character let's move on to another 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:11.690
 satellite find and small 402 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:26.260
 here transporte 12 674 channels go to 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:30.340
 free access the first channel 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:32.800
 Well, that is, all channels go ft but we have them 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:36.190
 we can not see why because 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:39.639
 what's under broadcast standards and vibe c2 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:41.970
 written t 2 m oh this means that 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:45.180
 satellite signal 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:49.060
 broadcast for distribution 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:55.200
 digital terrestrial television ie 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:55.200
 for us it is unavailable come back 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:10.750
 click on the main asia got out 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:14.419
 and conveyor range 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:17.360
 then forgot nothing well let's do it again 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:21.320
 repeat for the settings that is in order 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:24.020
 to set up the receiver and score fresh 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:26.350
 new topical today 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:30.370
 Prospect order and open the table 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:32.990
 we are interested in the satellite 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:38.449
 conveyor cleanliness indicate 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:39.310
 polarized and the next bars here are y 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:42.680
 we are coming 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:47.830
 symbol rate is indicated by this 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:47.830
 conveyor fact 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:52.850
 usually on car receivers if you have 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:55.729
 there is no such function then deliver this 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:59.270
 which is listed for this transformer 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:06:03.770
 and modulation if required by your 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:06.280
 receiver when setting go back to 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.280
 main page 

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:15.200
 Consider this old table with its 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:18.500
 help we can view the list of ft 

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:23.260
 channels that interest us let's say 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:26.590
 Russian channels click on Europe and 

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:31.880
 Countries looking for our country in Russia 

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:36.349
 click on it appears before us 

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:40.610
 table let's say channel 24 dock 

00:06:36.349 --> 00:06:44.330
 one against satellites on which he 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:46.570
 broadcast 140 85 

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:48.210
 the same can be done with 

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:51.100
 radio channels 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:54.070
 that's all if there are any questions 

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:56.700
 ask in the comments on youtube or
