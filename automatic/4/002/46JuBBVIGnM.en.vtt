00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 educate tina the education site number 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.020
 one of latin america welcome 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.929
 again to the history videos of 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.179
 ducati on this occasion we will continue 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.240
 speaking as we did in the previous 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.949
 video about the process of hominization 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.289
 we had defined at tertiary age 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.420
 that we said that corresponded inside 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.630
 of the Cenozoic era and we had started 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:28.050
 to define their periods the Paleocene 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:30.570
 the Eocene and the Aeolian if we still have 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.790
 two his periods to be defined we said 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.450
 then that the tertiary age begins 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:39.200
 approximately 70 million years ago 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:44.160
 so we stopped millions of years before 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:46.440
 of the present then we got into 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.200
 full in the Oligocene to continue with 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.000
 the other two your periods we're going here 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.120
 on the timeline and we said 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.780
 so that within this age 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:59.510
 tertiary we are going to have 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:03.469
 for the Palestinians the Eocene that already 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:05.960
 we saw and the oligocene then how to put 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:10.450
 here oils in the coat does not start 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:14.409
 approximately 35 million years ago 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:18.340
 and it will extend to 25 million 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:21.640
 of years before the oligocene present 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.990
 basically it was characterized by the 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.479
 emergence of hominids 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.030
 let's choose another color and we will 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:32.750
 put hominoids here that 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:35.840
 hominoids were going to be about all 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.100
 things the great places that the 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.619
 domains is that we have them here in 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.710
 screen then we talk about the 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:44.450
 Hominoids like the great apes 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.659
 later in the period that 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.810
 it continues to be called Miocene that 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:53.750
 begins around 25 million years 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.509
 before the present we are going to have the 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.429
 diversification of hominoids that 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:00.510
 the ponies are going to be divided into two groups 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:02.100
 2 and friends 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.080
 with what we are interested in 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.900
 we are the domains since 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.060
 we belong to that family is 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.250
 our kind of family tree of 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.890
 the evolution therefore we will notice 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.410
 here the appearance of the domains and 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.470
 let's use a new color let's 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.750
 put here or mini 2 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.820
 so let's take a dropdown arrow 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.160
 the image that helps us graph what 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.590
 that is very small so we have the 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.860
 oligocene where the domains appear 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:35.370
 then in the Miocene appear the 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:39.290
 hominids and finally to end with 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:42.570
 this tertiary age or this was tertiary 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:46.470
 we talk about the Pliocene so we're going to 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:48.080
 note here rivers that in the last stage 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:52.290
 Tertiary starting ago 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:55.040
 about 5 million years ago 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.960
 of the present then let's put here 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.300
 5 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.100
 millions of years before the present 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.190
 we are going to erase because we were 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:07.700
 pretty feito here on 5 so we're going 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:11.900
 to put again then we said do 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:14.060
 5 million years before the present the 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.160
 first sine is characteristic 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:21.050
 basically characterized by the appearance 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:22.790
 of the australopithecus and austria 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:27.379
 do not 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:29.599
 end of course they are going to be the first 

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:31.310
 antecedent of the evolution chain of 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:33.409
 name of this process of hominization 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:36.379
 what matters is that our object of 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:38.569
 study here in the video and then the 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:40.849
 quaternary will derive in the 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:43.069
 appearance of man has a 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:44.750
 primitive characteristic of how the 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:47.209
 placed we do not know each other today 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.730
 therefore we invite you to the later 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:51.769
 video where we will analyze the Quaternary 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.109
 and it will allow us to finish understanding 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:56.329
 these geological ages if they were a 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:58.579
 context that allowed the 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:00.230
 hominization process thanks for 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:03.200
 accompany us in this video and the 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:05.510
 we wait in the next 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:09.110
 educational I recommend the following 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:27.490
 videos so you can keep learning 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:27.490
