00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
fitting if the notch is just right and

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.120 
fitting if the notch is just right and
it's<00:03:34.930> covered<00:03:35.260> with<00:03:35.290> another<00:03:35.590> piece<00:03:35.769> of<00:03:35.950> trim

which is great for winter heat loss or

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.410 
which is great for winter heat loss or
preventing<00:04:52.140> we<00:04:52.260> people<00:04:52.470> enter<00:04:52.740> heat<00:04:52.920> loss<00:04:53.420> but

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:54.420 
preventing we people enter heat loss but

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:55.940 
preventing we people enter heat loss but
there's<00:04:54.570> really<00:04:54.720> nothing<00:04:55.140> to<00:04:55.500> protect

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 
there's really nothing to protect

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
against the sun's solar energy so the

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.300 
against the sun's solar energy so the
argon<00:04:58.320> gas<00:04:58.350> is<00:04:58.770> going<00:04:58.920> to<00:04:59.010> help<00:04:59.130> in<00:04:59.250> the

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
argon gas is going to help in the

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:00.860 
argon gas is going to help in the
summertime<00:04:59.610> but<00:04:59.880> that<00:05:00.030> you<00:05:00.180> said<00:05:00.360> it<00:05:00.510> it<00:05:00.630> does

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
summertime but that you said it it does

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.750 
summertime but that you said it it does
have<00:05:01.020> a<00:05:01.050> coating<00:05:01.440> on<00:05:01.530> it<00:05:01.590> yes<00:05:01.890> this<00:05:02.340> one<00:05:02.550> so

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
have a coating on it yes this one so

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.430 
have a coating on it yes this one so
LeBron<00:05:03.030> so<00:05:03.450> it<00:05:03.510> has<00:05:03.570> a<00:05:03.660> bronze<00:05:03.930> coating<00:05:04.320> on<00:05:04.410> it

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
LeBron so it has a bronze coating on it

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.990 
LeBron so it has a bronze coating on it
it<00:05:04.680> does<00:05:04.830> reflect<00:05:04.950> away<00:05:05.370> some<00:05:05.610> of<00:05:05.640> the<00:05:05.760> heat

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 
it does reflect away some of the heat

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.460 
it does reflect away some of the heat
how<00:05:06.270> better<00:05:06.510> than<00:05:06.750> just<00:05:07.050> a<00:05:07.140> plain<00:05:07.350> an

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
how better than just a plain an

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.020 
how better than just a plain an
insulated<00:05:07.980> glass<00:05:08.100> pane<00:05:08.400> so<00:05:08.670> it'll<00:05:08.850> help<00:05:08.940> a

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
insulated glass pane so it'll help a

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:10.760 
insulated glass pane so it'll help a
little<00:05:09.180> bit<00:05:09.330> so<00:05:09.630> it'll<00:05:10.050> definitely<00:05:10.290> help<00:05:10.530> them

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
little bit so it'll definitely help them

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.010 
little bit so it'll definitely help them
okay<00:05:11.220> this<00:05:11.490> other<00:05:11.730> one<00:05:11.880> is<00:05:12.000> low<00:05:12.210> e<00:05:12.240> glass<00:05:12.390> which

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
okay this other one is low e glass which

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.240 
okay this other one is low e glass which
most<00:05:13.230> people<00:05:13.380> have<00:05:13.620> heard<00:05:13.650> of<00:05:13.890> it's<00:05:14.070> very

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
most people have heard of it's very

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:15.800 
most people have heard of it's very
common<00:05:14.640> now<00:05:14.760> and<00:05:14.970> you<00:05:15.150> get<00:05:15.360> for<00:05:15.510> windows

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
common now and you get for windows

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.080 
common now and you get for windows
windows<00:05:16.020> and<00:05:16.320> doors<00:05:16.500> again<00:05:17.100> it's<00:05:17.490> enough<00:05:17.880> it's

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
windows and doors again it's enough it's

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.330 
windows and doors again it's enough it's
an<00:05:18.240> insulated<00:05:18.630> glass<00:05:18.780> and<00:05:19.110> it<00:05:19.230> has<00:05:19.380> a<00:05:19.770> blow

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
an insulated glass and it has a blow

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.040 
an insulated glass and it has a blow
emissivities<00:05:20.700> on<00:05:21.330> the<00:05:21.420> number<00:05:21.660> two<00:05:21.810> glasses

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
emissivities on the number two glasses

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.690 
emissivities on the number two glasses
yeah<00:05:22.970> the<00:05:23.970> third<00:05:24.180> one<00:05:24.390> is<00:05:24.630> four<00:05:24.990> seasons<00:05:25.380> class

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:25.700 
yeah the third one is four seasons class

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.980 
yeah the third one is four seasons class
if<00:05:26.700> you<00:05:26.850> look<00:05:26.970> at<00:05:27.090> around<00:05:27.210> the<00:05:27.420> radiometers

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
if you look at around the radiometers

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:29.690 
if you look at around the radiometers
you<00:05:28.110> can<00:05:28.260> see<00:05:28.470> that<00:05:28.800> both<00:05:29.070> of<00:05:29.130> these<00:05:29.370> two<00:05:29.580> are

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:29.700 
you can see that both of these two are

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.190 
you can see that both of these two are
spinning<00:05:30.030> quite<00:05:30.210> a<00:05:30.240> bit<00:05:30.480> yeah<00:05:30.750> and<00:05:31.020> if<00:05:31.110> you

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:31.200 
spinning quite a bit yeah and if you

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.870 
spinning quite a bit yeah and if you
imagine<00:05:31.410> that<00:05:31.650> that<00:05:31.860> was<00:05:32.040> your<00:05:32.190> electric

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:32.880 
imagine that that was your electric

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.360 
imagine that that was your electric
meter<00:05:33.690> spinning<00:05:34.230> trying<00:05:34.800> to<00:05:34.860> keep<00:05:35.010> this<00:05:35.160> room

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
meter spinning trying to keep this room

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.580 
meter spinning trying to keep this room
cool<00:05:35.640> okay<00:05:36.180> that's<00:05:36.720> tied<00:05:36.930> in<00:05:37.050> a<00:05:37.110> lot<00:05:37.260> something

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:37.590 
cool okay that's tied in a lot something

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:40.340 
cool okay that's tied in a lot something
that<00:05:37.890> you<00:05:38.010> want<00:05:38.220> okay<00:05:38.760> this<00:05:39.630> one<00:05:39.810> third<00:05:40.050> one<00:05:40.230> is

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:40.350 
that you want okay this one third one is

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:42.290 
that you want okay this one third one is
four<00:05:40.530> seasons<00:05:40.920> less<00:05:41.100> and<00:05:41.670> it<00:05:41.820> was<00:05:42.150> designed

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 
four seasons less and it was designed

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.420 
four seasons less and it was designed
specifically<00:05:43.080> for<00:05:43.200> rooms<00:05:43.800> made<00:05:44.070> a<00:05:44.100> blast

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430 
specifically for rooms made a blast

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.850 
specifically for rooms made a blast
let's<00:05:45.360> gather<00:05:45.510> heavier<00:05:45.870> coating<00:05:46.200> that

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
let's gather heavier coating that

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.290 
let's gather heavier coating that
reflects<00:05:47.280> a<00:05:47.400> lot<00:05:47.550> more<00:05:47.730> of<00:05:47.790> the<00:05:47.940> sun's<00:05:48.090> energy

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
reflects a lot more of the sun's energy

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.810 
reflects a lot more of the sun's energy
away<00:05:48.780> so<00:05:49.260> from<00:05:49.500> windows<00:05:49.830> and<00:05:50.040> doors<00:05:50.250> the<00:05:50.640> LOI

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:50.820 
away so from windows and doors the LOI

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.150 
away so from windows and doors the LOI
would<00:05:51.150> be<00:05:51.240> fine<00:05:51.510> that<00:05:51.840> when<00:05:51.990> you<00:05:52.110> build<00:05:52.320> all<00:05:52.860> of

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:53.160 
would be fine that when you build all of

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.159 
would be fine that when you build all of
your<00:05:53.280> walls<00:05:53.520> ceiling<00:05:54.270> the<00:05:54.360> root<00:05:54.510> glass<00:05:54.810> then

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:55.169 
your walls ceiling the root glass then

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:57.050 
your walls ceiling the root glass then
it<00:05:55.800> really<00:05:56.040> don't<00:05:56.340> have<00:05:56.460> a<00:05:56.520> special<00:05:56.880> glass

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.060 
it really don't have a special glass

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.450 
it really don't have a special glass
made<00:05:57.300> just<00:05:57.630> for<00:05:57.930> that<00:05:57.960> purpose<00:05:58.140> okay<00:05:58.950> when<00:05:59.340> you

00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 
made just for that purpose okay when you

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.040 
made just for that purpose okay when you
can<00:05:59.580> if<00:05:59.700> you<00:05:59.970> put<00:06:00.150> your<00:06:00.270> hand<00:06:00.450> in<00:06:00.600> between<00:06:00.690> any

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.050 
can if you put your hand in between any

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:02.360 
can if you put your hand in between any
of<00:06:01.110> these<00:06:01.230> you<00:06:01.470> can<00:06:01.620> actually<00:06:01.740> feel<00:06:01.919> the<00:06:02.100> heat

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:02.370 
of these you can actually feel the heat

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:05.090 
of these you can actually feel the heat
through<00:06:02.610> it<00:06:02.730> oh<00:06:02.910> very<00:06:03.840> good<00:06:04.350> thanks<00:06:04.740> that's

Maine to Arizona and Alaska to the
Middle<00:06:11.580> East<00:06:11.760> ok<00:06:12.210> and<00:06:12.360> the<00:06:12.419> coating<00:06:12.750> will<00:06:12.870> cut

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.050 
Middle East ok and the coating will cut

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:14.840 
Middle East ok and the coating will cut
down<00:06:13.080> on<00:06:13.410> the<00:06:13.500> summertime<00:06:14.010> heat<00:06:14.310> gain<00:06:14.550> and

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:14.850 
down on the summertime heat gain and

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:16.940 
down on the summertime heat gain and
then<00:06:15.419> the<00:06:15.750> argon<00:06:16.080> gas<00:06:16.110> and<00:06:16.590> everything<00:06:16.830> will

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:16.950 
then the argon gas and everything will

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:19.100 
then the argon gas and everything will
help<00:06:17.160> yeah<00:06:17.640> yeah<00:06:17.880> that<00:06:18.270> Cody<00:06:18.450> actually<00:06:18.870> helps

help yeah yeah that Cody actually helps
in<00:06:19.200> the<00:06:19.260> winter<00:06:19.530> as<00:06:19.650> well<00:06:19.680> because<00:06:20.070> it's

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:20.190 
in the winter as well because it's

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:23.150 
in the winter as well because it's
reflecting<00:06:20.700> the<00:06:21.680> energy<00:06:22.680> that<00:06:22.710> you<00:06:22.860> put<00:06:22.890> into
