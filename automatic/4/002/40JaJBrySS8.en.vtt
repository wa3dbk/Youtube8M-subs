00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:48.939 

so<00:00:46.969> here's<00:00:47.360> the<00:00:47.960> whole<00:00:48.079> deal<00:00:48.350> with<00:00:48.530> the<00:00:48.620> 4matic

00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:48.949 
so here's the whole deal with the 4matic

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:50.590 
so here's the whole deal with the 4matic
all-wheel<00:00:49.160> drive<00:00:49.579> system<00:00:49.940> why<00:00:50.030> it's<00:00:50.180> perfect

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
all-wheel drive system why it's perfect

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.470 
all-wheel drive system why it's perfect
for<00:00:50.629> this<00:00:50.840> type<00:00:51.050> of<00:00:51.079> landscape<00:00:51.829> as<00:00:52.239> often<00:00:53.239> as

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
for this type of landscape as often as

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.079 
for this type of landscape as often as
necessary<00:00:54.260> as<00:00:54.530> seldom<00:00:54.890> as<00:00:55.250> possible<00:00:55.940> you

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:56.089 
necessary as seldom as possible you

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:58.540 
necessary as seldom as possible you
remember<00:00:56.540> that<00:00:56.690> motto<00:00:56.960> because<00:00:57.829> that<00:00:58.339> is

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
remember that motto because that is

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.509 
remember that motto because that is
referring<00:00:58.969> to<00:00:59.149> variable<00:01:00.110> torque

00:01:00.509 --> 00:01:00.519 
referring to variable torque

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:03.430 
referring to variable torque
distribution<00:01:01.659> how<00:01:02.659> does<00:01:02.839> that<00:01:02.960> work<00:01:03.199> the

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
distribution how does that work the

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.109 
distribution how does that work the
torque<00:01:03.680> distribution<00:01:04.280> is<00:01:04.369> normally<00:01:04.790> in<00:01:04.940> the

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
torque distribution is normally in the

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:06.820 
torque distribution is normally in the
front<00:01:05.449> so<00:01:05.690> basic<00:01:06.110> driving<00:01:06.470> is<00:01:06.560> going<00:01:06.680> to<00:01:06.740> be

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
front so basic driving is going to be

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.770 
front so basic driving is going to be
front-wheel<00:01:07.220> drive<00:01:07.280> in<00:01:07.640> the<00:01:07.700> front<00:01:07.940> axle<00:01:08.270> will

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
front-wheel drive in the front axle will

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.660 
front-wheel drive in the front axle will
be<00:01:08.960> in<00:01:09.170> main<00:01:09.500> control<00:01:10.040> but<00:01:10.190> as<00:01:10.280> soon<00:01:10.490> as

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
be in main control but as soon as

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.940 
be in main control but as soon as
necessary<00:01:11.300> up<00:01:11.750> to<00:01:12.080> 50<00:01:12.440> percent<00:01:12.830> of<00:01:12.890> that

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
necessary up to 50 percent of that

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.310 
necessary up to 50 percent of that
torque<00:01:13.280> can<00:01:13.490> swoop<00:01:14.060> to<00:01:14.090> the<00:01:14.420> rear<00:01:14.630> axle<00:01:14.840> and

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
torque can swoop to the rear axle and

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.139 
torque can swoop to the rear axle and
that's<00:01:15.770> exactly<00:01:16.340> what's<00:01:16.520> helping<00:01:16.880> stabilize

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:17.149 
that's exactly what's helping stabilize

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:20.889 
that's exactly what's helping stabilize
the<00:01:17.960> driving<00:01:18.470> right<00:01:18.950> now<00:01:19.160> right<00:01:19.820> here<00:01:20.119> whoa

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:20.899 
the driving right now right here whoa

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:24.969 
the driving right now right here whoa
yeah<00:01:21.860> so<00:01:22.610> the<00:01:22.729> so-called<00:01:23.080> torque<00:01:24.080> on<00:01:24.320> demand

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
yeah so the so-called torque on demand

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.100 
yeah so the so-called torque on demand
will<00:01:25.729> allow<00:01:25.940> distribution<00:01:26.630> to<00:01:26.720> switch<00:01:26.929> from

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
will allow distribution to switch from

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.770 
will allow distribution to switch from
front<00:01:27.470> to<00:01:27.710> back<00:01:27.860> as<00:01:28.280> needed<00:01:29.060> and<00:01:29.330> that's

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
front to back as needed and that's

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.020 
front to back as needed and that's
exactly<00:01:30.140> why<00:01:30.440> you'll<00:01:30.649> feel<00:01:30.920> stable<00:01:31.880> that's

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
exactly why you'll feel stable that's

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.010 
exactly why you'll feel stable that's
exactly<00:01:32.390> what's<00:01:32.539> going<00:01:32.659> to<00:01:32.720> give<00:01:32.840> you<00:01:32.929> an

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
exactly what's going to give you an

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.680 
exactly what's going to give you an
outstanding<00:01:33.770> grip<00:01:34.009> on<00:01:34.220> any<00:01:34.550> and<00:01:34.909> every<00:01:35.450> type

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
outstanding grip on any and every type

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.870 
outstanding grip on any and every type
of<00:01:35.720> street<00:01:36.170> that's<00:01:36.619> why<00:01:36.860> I<00:01:36.890> can<00:01:37.340> actually<00:01:37.490> do

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
of street that's why I can actually do

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.520 
of street that's why I can actually do
this<00:01:38.060> without<00:01:38.330> being<00:01:38.479> too<00:01:39.110> scared<00:01:39.440> whoa<00:01:41.530> most

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
this without being too scared whoa most

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.310 
this without being too scared whoa most
of<00:01:42.679> the<00:01:42.770> time

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.800
