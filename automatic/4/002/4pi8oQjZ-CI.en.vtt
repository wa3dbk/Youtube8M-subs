00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.670
 we are going to need 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:27.990

 What are we going to do? 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.059
 we have color capacity that 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.100
 we need when we find it that 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.839
 is there normally of many we are going to 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.309
 do a training with Chinese paper and 

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:00.170
 and what we have, we're going to 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:02.629
 fill also with china paper to 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.610
 that is not too much what we go 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:06.920
 to put here very loaded or equal 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.110
 moving everything you want we are going 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:14.030
 to use what is 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:16.250
 chocolate and peanuts 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.690
 let's go do the combination of 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.690
 chocolates and peanuts 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.100
 most beautiful 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:34.820
 and this is not going to cover 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.820
 how are we left because 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.929
 i 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.550
 let's close it 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.890
 This is one special that already 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.170
 they sell like this in stores 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:00.210
 easy crafts you find as 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:02.950
 I always like what's left over and good 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.080
 because this combination is good because 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.820
 normally he gets what we have 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.190
 been working sweet we can you 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.420
 put gum but there are times that you're 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.110
 at the party and you feel like something 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.970
 different 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.060
 chocolatito with something salt the blackboard not 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:19.239
 be saladito and then it remains rich already 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.160
 we have this like this and we're going to do 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.460
 need what are fabrics in this case 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.340
 I beat you 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:30.020
 We are going to put some silicon in the 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.020
 back of our castle 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.870
 and we are going to start making the decoration 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.379
 here we are going to suck 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.680
 we put silicon also so that 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:58.400
 move 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.950
 and it's not going down because as a trail to 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.150
 the base on our line may be 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:08.310
 is going down 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.310
 let's put a star 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:15.700
 we are also going to tie it 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.700
 and right here 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:27.250
 and from here we're going to start doing something 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:30.810
 simple but that looks cute with the 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.810
 same fabric we are going to 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:41.420
 make a mooring 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.420
 nothing else thicker 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:49.540
 so that more is seen what is on the cloth 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.540
 as if it were a ribbon he cited 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.690

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.730
