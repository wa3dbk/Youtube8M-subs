00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:06.970
 with francisco el gallo estrada bueno 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:09.340
 Well, here in the state of Mexico 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.260
 closing your preparation 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.880
 with the dream of being the best pound for 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.490
 pound of Mexican boxing in these 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:20.490
 moments and his confrontation with giovanni 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.490
 sure of being able to power or how you look 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.620
 we are preparing for this fight 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.620
 it's going to be hard I do not know 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:32.840
 from the 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.840
 but nothing 

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:38.820
 I enjoyed it 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.820
 Preparing for victory 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.360
 giovanni sure a warrior as 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:48.340
 you say to fire 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.340
 how do you look with respect 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.320
 Busquets and inspires 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:01:01.080
 and more than anything because a great fighter 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:04.320
 fighter that we do not know what a value is 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:07.280
 that there is his story we are 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.280
 preparing to win 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.899
 He already has many doubts since 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.230
 we are preparing to win you 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.230
 I say 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:24.970
 it is an important pearl if we win 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.460
 we go up 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.750
 contest all systems up 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.780
 beating Giovanni for sure he would come 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:37.120
 to criticize another title look for a 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.120
 third world title climb division 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.130
 with viloria was nobody in the 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.439
 championship the new belts and then 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.509
 I think I made a fourth notification 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:51.549
 and people recognized me now per 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:55.800
 giving you safe with lamb if we win 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:58.140
 this fight we will be more seen 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.420
 they challenged another champion for 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.220
 unify titles or equal to 0 other 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.710
 defense since this is going to be the third 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.740
 and if it does not work out I'll be I think 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.880
 one or two more years in weight fly 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.460
 generation of equal strawberries and sale 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.990
 have conflict to tone up would be 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.000
 well fight against another option 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.160
 the title of the world boxing council 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.050
 it does not catch your attention 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.970
 Well, any title, I do not think 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.370
 mean by a champion as by the 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.230
 coffee I think it's a good one more than anything 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.900
 a good preparation to get to 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:34.260
 do someone with history and do 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:36.440
 that's the best either with Japanese 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.200
 for the championship 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:42.970
 by francisco mentioned that people 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:46.300
 he does not fully recognize you yet but 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.300
 I think so 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.810
 well maybe to recognize maybe from 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.210
 know the name of the rooster estrada but 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.070
 not to recognize what is or not I think that 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.530
 they will win the victory against 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.870
 champion that was scola tito gonzÃ¡lez 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.890
 line for getting rid of zorita burst 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:07.020
 with the 1st 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.020
 classified as was the invention 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:18.070
 or at least people who do not know boxing 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:21.160
 says I 'm missing maybe but 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.960
 we are in that we are leaving little by little not 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.000
 I can eat the cake of a single 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.830
 snack we 're not learning 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.240
 as it says all the champion but I'm going 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.240
 learning and little by little 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.880
 She was waiting for your record in these 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:38.560
 moments 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:44.319
 I have two pieces days 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:46.840
 they did not win 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:52.359
 the former super flyweight world champion with 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:54.760
 Carlos Sanchez and a lot of people 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:56.499
 if it is me because it is to fight, it has not 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.040
 lost with great fighters like 

00:03:56.499 --> 00:04:00.730
 they 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.730
 perhaps 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:06.939
 a very close fight we fight our 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:30.780
 but the fact that it represents 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:33.540
 to older 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:39.430
 one 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:43.390
 that helps us make us acclimated 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:47.130
 to fight the df for problems my 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:47.130
 first time here is very nice 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.750
 thank you very much for your words
