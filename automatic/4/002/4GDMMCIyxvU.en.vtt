00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.390
 hello to all so this week no 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.350
 ol matches but we still have to 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.000
 hot news 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.369
 so let's talk about our friends from the south of 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.810
 france anthony lopes we will come back on 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.820
 the whistles of the velodrome stadium 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.230
 and to finish my prognosis even if he 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.230
 is not always good then it's gone 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:29.580
 so this week we come back twenty years 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.470
 backward 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.329
 after the busyness om go on to the sphere of 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.070
 Olympic Nimes in club corruption 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.300
 for which I played from 2008 to 2010 this 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.790
 which is a bit in turmoil 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.620
 there that frédéric thiriez what for me 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.270
 hides behind his mustache to 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.400
 not know that it exists in the 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.840
 football it exists and it will exist again 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.250
 for me there are two distinct things in 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.750
 football via active corruption 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.220
 it is she or there is a compensation 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.270
 financial or material for 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.250
 the arrangement of a match and a 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.470
 result and small arrangements 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.090
 with friends who exist at the end of the season 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.040
 because nothing else has nobody 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.390
 has nothing to play and that the 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.870
 results arranges the two teams the 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.970
 two clubs 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.559
 for my part in my career I was 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.080
 confronted that at the second the small 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.369
 arrangements between friends animate in the end 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.990
 of year 2009 we stay at the 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.150
 last day and this is the first 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.249
 times an attacker who loses to 1.0 me 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.659
 request to clear gently to take 

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:17.680
 my time and time getting back 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.390
 what is it and 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.130
 it surprises at the beginning of course but 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.810
 when we know that there are friends from 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.810
 and else in each team 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.360
 we understand after everyone is 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.830
 happy the little thing that comes back to me 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.970
 also it's the year of the second 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.760
 title of the ol where we will play at 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.100
 montpellier did 0-0 and 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.340
 a point gives us champions and a 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.799
 point 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.479
 maintain montpellier here we did 0 0 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:42.679
 only little scare in the match the 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.179
 40 - minute strike from juninho who 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:44.479
 was getting impatient a bit bouncing off 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:46.009
 bar 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.619
 it woke everyone up a bit 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:51.020
 supporters the leaders the staffs 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.219
 that's it but what is really 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.590
 inadmissible in football that's 

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:56.650
 when there is real corruption the 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.720
 real active corruption 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.490
 because the little arrangements between 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.680
 friends are a little disinterested then 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.120
 there corruption after corruption that 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.720
 where the financial compensation and 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.310
 hardware 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.600
 it's inadmissible it's illegal 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:13.810
 not the right to do that and that could 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:15.400
 really football I wanted to talk 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.510
 the good attitude of anthony lopes on 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.060
 the goal we take against guingamp 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.740
 because for me if anthony lopes is 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.080
 a less good goalkeeper is never cashed 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.490
 this goal because mom my guardian 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.930
 would have stayed on his line would have suffered 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:27.550
 the action the ball bounces on the bar 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.320
 and we would never have cashed the goal there 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.030
 anthony lopez has a real attitude of 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.470
 winner it is a competitor he undergoes 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.700
 not the action he wants to try to go 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.380
 look for this balloon he hates 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.730
 take goals and it feels so he 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.380
 try a ball in spite of everything 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.240
 to go for it is not necessarily 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.440
 obvious and but the german he has the 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.880
 bad luck that ball bounces him on 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.290
 the shoulder and get into the cage so 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.760
 finally I'm not at all compared 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.510
 to his morale I do not at all by 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.390
 relation to his future 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.310
 because a guardian with an attitude so 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:57.910
 positive and to the state of mind as good 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:59.230
 can go that very high when he told me 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.490
 disturbed this week is the whistles 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.989
 from the velodrome stadium to some 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.860
 players of the France team 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:05.290
 lyonnais the parisians 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.730
 I find this attitude a bit without 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.430
 to be indignant of course but I find 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.450
 this attitude a little irresponsible 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.860
 because we come to support the team of 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.450
 France must be able to show 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.800
 discernment support the team of 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.030
 france the motherland the nation 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.920
 it's very good that it could have happened 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.090
 in gerland with super with 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.560
 Saint Etienne players 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.580
 well we were lucky because he did not 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.630
 not many people stéphane team 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.070
 of France lately so that's it 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.870
 could not happen but it's true 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.760
 that we often complain that the team of 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.709
 France will not play in the provinces 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.910
 it's often happening in Paris 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.230
 Parisian supporters elsewhere do not make 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.370
 no proof of more intelligence because 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.019
 that they also whistle the fans 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.090
 Marseilles players Marseille pardon 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.650
 but I think that's the team of 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.810
 France and the knowledge of all is the nation 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.580
 it's the homeland here without doing too much 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.410
 patriotic I think that when we come 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.890
 support his national team it takes 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:49.050
 know reason keep as they say 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.970
 often and that's showing a little 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.140
 more intelligence and keep them 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:58.830
 parochial quarrels for the matches of 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:04:00.870
 championship this week direction 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:04.020
 the island of beauty for ol face to bastia 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.130
 in Corsica a very complicated match we know 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.180
 that it's always hard to play 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.830
 furiani the bastiais do not have 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.780
 the bitch coach and one day the ol to 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.860
 several wound returns we know 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.390
 not in which composition will play 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.860
 hubert to provide my little nabil darling 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.570
 fekir is absent for suspension 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.400
 so I see an overwhelming victory of 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.940
 Olympic Lyonnais 1-0 not know what 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.440
 you say 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.359
 I await your feedback your comments 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.109
 and I tell you next week on 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:24.109
 prick them and not as
