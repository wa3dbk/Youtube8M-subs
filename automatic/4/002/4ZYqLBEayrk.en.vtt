about the wiki and so one of the places
you<00:00:58.500> can<00:00:58.649> enable<00:00:58.950> webdav<00:00:59.550> access<00:01:00.030> is<00:01:00.239> here<00:01:00.630> on

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
you can enable webdav access is here on

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.720 
you can enable webdav access is here on
your<00:01:00.870> wiki<00:01:01.110> so<00:01:01.770> that<00:01:01.980> anything<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:02.700> put

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730

on<00:01:03.000> your<00:01:03.300> wiki<00:01:03.540> site<00:01:03.989> will<00:01:04.860> be<00:01:04.949> available<00:01:05.250> to

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
on your wiki site will be available to

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.149 
on your wiki site will be available to
your<00:01:05.610> iOS<00:01:05.939> device<00:01:06.479> through<00:01:07.380> I<00:01:07.409> work<00:01:07.890> files

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
your iOS device through I work files

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.099 
your iOS device through I work files
okay<00:01:08.700> so<00:01:08.759> those<00:01:08.999> are<00:01:09.119> things<00:01:09.240> like<00:01:09.389> pages<00:01:09.719> and

00:01:10.099 --> 00:01:10.109 
okay so those are things like pages and

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:11.719 
okay so those are things like pages and
numbers<00:01:10.259> and<00:01:10.710> those<00:01:10.829> kinds<00:01:11.189> of<00:01:11.249> things<00:01:11.399> okay

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
numbers and those kinds of things okay

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.629 
numbers and those kinds of things okay
so<00:01:11.789> this<00:01:11.999> is<00:01:12.149> one<00:01:12.299> place<00:01:12.479> you<00:01:12.600> can<00:01:12.780> do<00:01:13.020> that<00:01:13.639> the

00:01:14.629 --> 00:01:14.639 
so this is one place you can do that the

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:16.940 
so this is one place you can do that the
other<00:01:14.670> place<00:01:15.090> is<00:01:15.270> in<00:01:15.389> file<00:01:15.630> sharing<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.229> so<00:01:16.859> if

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
other place is in file sharing and so if

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.379 
other place is in file sharing and so if
you<00:01:17.039> come<00:01:17.189> into<00:01:17.340> file<00:01:17.609> sharing<00:01:17.969> you've<00:01:18.210> got

00:01:18.379 --> 00:01:18.389 
you come into file sharing you've got

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:20.899 
you come into file sharing you've got
your<00:01:18.569> various<00:01:18.929> share<00:01:19.200> points<00:01:19.649> here<00:01:19.889> and<00:01:20.069> what

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
your various share points here and what

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.699 
your various share points here and what
you<00:01:21.030> can<00:01:21.209> do<00:01:21.359> is<00:01:21.569> make<00:01:21.810> any<00:01:22.020> of<00:01:22.289> your<00:01:22.439> share

00:01:22.699 --> 00:01:22.709 
you can do is make any of your share

00:01:22.709 --> 00:01:25.819 
you can do is make any of your share
points<00:01:23.219> available<00:01:23.420> for<00:01:24.420> webdav<00:01:25.020> access<00:01:25.590> which

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:25.829 
points available for webdav access which

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:28.459 
points available for webdav access which
then<00:01:26.069> makes<00:01:26.280> them<00:01:26.549> available<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:27.450> your<00:01:28.109> iOS

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:28.469 
then makes them available to your iOS

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:31.309 
then makes them available to your iOS
devices<00:01:28.950> so<00:01:29.700> for<00:01:30.030> instance<00:01:30.119> I've<00:01:30.780> got<00:01:30.990> kids

00:01:31.309 --> 00:01:31.319

these two here are the only one that are

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:40.380 
these two here are the only one that are
really<00:05:38.740> accessible<00:05:39.220> because<00:05:39.400> these<00:05:39.910> are

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:40.390 
really accessible because these are

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:43.260 
really accessible because these are
basically<00:05:41.260> blog<00:05:41.650> entries<00:05:42.160> that<00:05:42.370> I've<00:05:42.850> put<00:05:43.090> in

want them to show up and you would

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.010 
want them to show up and you would
simply<00:06:12.400> click<00:06:12.700> them<00:06:12.910> here<00:06:13.330> these<00:06:13.810> aren't

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:16.240 
going to really move so I don't think

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.360 
going to really move so I don't think
I'm<00:06:16.330> going<00:06:16.480> to<00:06:16.540> be<00:06:16.690> able<00:06:16.750> to<00:06:16.960> do<00:06:17.170> that<00:06:17.380> yeah<00:06:18.340> I

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:18.370 
I'm going to be able to do that yeah I

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:20.310 
I'm going to be able to do that yeah I
guess<00:06:18.520> I<00:06:18.640> could<00:06:18.850> I<00:06:19.030> could<00:06:19.240> say<00:06:19.570> move<00:06:19.870> to<00:06:20.080> wiki

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:20.320 
guess I could I could say move to wiki

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:22.500 
guess I could I could say move to wiki
okay<00:06:21.010> so<00:06:21.070> I<00:06:21.190> can<00:06:21.400> move<00:06:21.550> that<00:06:21.760> particular<00:06:22.240> post

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:22.510 
okay so I can move that particular post

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:24.840 
okay so I can move that particular post
over<00:06:23.230> to<00:06:23.410> the<00:06:23.560> wiki<00:06:23.740> and<00:06:24.040> when<00:06:24.160> I<00:06:24.190> do<00:06:24.310> that<00:06:24.640> then

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:24.850
