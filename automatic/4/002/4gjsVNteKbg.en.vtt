mean yeah it's the more practice the

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.520 
mean yeah it's the more practice the
better<00:00:46.850> here<00:00:47.239> the<00:00:47.899> track<00:00:48.140> is<00:00:48.170> very

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
better here the track is very

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.420 
better here the track is very
challenging<00:00:49.750> it's<00:00:50.750> very<00:00:50.930> deceiving<00:00:51.379> it<00:00:51.860> it

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
challenging it's very deceiving it it

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.430 
challenging it's very deceiving it it
looks<00:00:52.640> as<00:00:52.789> though<00:00:52.820> just<00:00:53.420> as<00:00:53.600> an<00:00:53.840> outsider<00:00:54.170> you

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
looks as though just as an outsider you

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.779 
looks as though just as an outsider you
look<00:00:54.559> at<00:00:54.680> the<00:00:54.739> track<00:00:55.010> and<00:00:55.190> in<00:00:55.250> psycho<00:00:55.489> it's<00:00:55.670> not

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789 
look at the track and in psycho it's not

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:57.670 
look at the track and in psycho it's not
that<00:00:55.940> difficult<00:00:56.120> but<00:00:56.539> you're<00:00:57.110> always<00:00:57.320> on<00:00:57.649> your

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
that difficult but you're always on your

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.500 
that difficult but you're always on your
toes<00:00:57.980> there's<00:00:58.280> so<00:00:58.520> many<00:00:58.640> things<00:00:58.760> happening

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
toes there's so many things happening

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.250 
toes there's so many things happening
it's<00:01:00.129> it's<00:01:01.129> a<00:01:01.250> fun<00:01:01.430> track<00:01:01.699> oh<00:01:01.989> these<00:01:02.989> Hall

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
packed dirt it's a three-dimensional

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.400 
packed dirt it's a three-dimensional
track<00:01:05.059> you<00:01:05.149> see<00:01:05.239> that<00:01:05.390> favors<00:01:05.869> the<00:01:05.990> American

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:06.410

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:10.009 
drivers um I mean the European drivers

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:13.330 
drivers um I mean the European drivers
now<00:01:10.190> run<00:01:10.820> on<00:01:10.850> on<00:01:11.420> us<00:01:12.170> l<00:01:12.410> traction<00:01:12.890> quite<00:01:13.039> a<00:01:13.070> bit

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
now run on on us l traction quite a bit

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.450 
now run on on us l traction quite a bit
I<00:01:14.210> mean<00:01:14.750> this<00:01:14.899> isn't<00:01:15.140> your<00:01:15.410> typical<00:01:15.590> us<00:01:16.160> track

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
I mean this isn't your typical us track

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.920 
I mean this isn't your typical us track
either<00:01:16.670> I<00:01:16.789> mean<00:01:17.000> there<00:01:17.149> is<00:01:17.240> a<00:01:17.270> lot<00:01:17.479> of<00:01:17.509> jumps

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
either I mean there is a lot of jumps

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.410 
either I mean there is a lot of jumps
and<00:01:18.110> bumps<00:01:18.140> but<00:01:18.619> this<00:01:19.160> is<00:01:19.429> definitely<00:01:20.030> not<00:01:20.270> a

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
and bumps but this is definitely not a

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.440 
and bumps but this is definitely not a
typical<00:01:20.660> us<00:01:21.200> how<00:01:22.160> much<00:01:22.340> work<00:01:23.119> could<00:01:23.360> be<00:01:23.420> done

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
typical us how much work could be done

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.059 
typical us how much work could be done
the<00:01:23.690> lowsee<00:01:24.020> car<00:01:24.229> mean<00:01:24.410> obviously<00:01:24.619> we<00:01:24.679> were

00:01:25.059 --> 00:01:25.069 
the lowsee car mean obviously we were

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:26.710 
the lowsee car mean obviously we were
talking<00:01:25.369> to<00:01:25.429> you<00:01:25.490> back<00:01:25.640> in<00:01:25.789> April<00:01:26.149> I<00:01:26.360> mean<00:01:26.660> is

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
it the same car you did a lot

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.339 
it the same car you did a lot
development<00:01:28.340> in<00:01:28.580> these<00:01:28.970> last<00:01:29.179> 17<00:01:29.539> months<00:01:29.690> yeah

00:01:30.339 --> 00:01:30.349 
development in these last 17 months yeah

00:01:30.349 --> 00:01:31.570 
development in these last 17 months yeah
I<00:01:30.380> mean<00:01:30.590> we've<00:01:30.709> spent<00:01:30.950> a<00:01:31.039> lot<00:01:31.069> of<00:01:31.190> time<00:01:31.310> with

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
I mean we've spent a lot of time with

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.010 
I mean we've spent a lot of time with
the<00:01:31.670> development<00:01:32.149> but<00:01:32.390> we're<00:01:32.840> running

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
the development but we're running

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.839 
the development but we're running
essentially<00:01:33.740> the<00:01:33.860> same<00:01:34.039> car<00:01:34.369> we<00:01:34.550> do<00:01:34.670> have<00:01:34.819> a

00:01:34.839 --> 00:01:34.849 
essentially the same car we do have a

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:36.880 
essentially the same car we do have a
few<00:01:35.119> new<00:01:35.300> parts<00:01:35.990> here<00:01:36.229> and<00:01:36.259> there<00:01:36.380> but<00:01:36.500> for<00:01:36.830> the

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
few new parts here and there but for the

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.710 
few new parts here and there but for the
most<00:01:37.069> part<00:01:37.190> it's<00:01:37.759> the<00:01:37.849> same<00:01:38.060> car<00:01:38.300> just<00:01:38.539> with<00:01:38.690> a

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
most part it's the same car just with a

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.529 
most part it's the same car just with a
few<00:01:38.959> refinements<00:01:40.179> when<00:01:41.179> you're<00:01:41.300> looking<00:01:41.479> to

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:41.539 
few refinements when you're looking to

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:43.990 
few refinements when you're looking to
set<00:01:41.750> the<00:01:41.840> car<00:01:42.050> up<00:01:42.289> I<00:01:42.500> mean<00:01:42.740> I<00:01:42.890> are<00:01:43.429> you<00:01:43.670> looking

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
for ultimate speed or do you have to

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.040 
for ultimate speed or do you have to
throttle<00:01:46.130> back<00:01:46.310> for<00:01:46.580> safety<00:01:46.940> as<00:01:47.030> such<00:01:47.239> for<00:01:47.899> me

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050
