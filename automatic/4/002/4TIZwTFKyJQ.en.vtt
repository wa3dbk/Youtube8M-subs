my<00:00:03.200> name<00:00:03.380> is<00:00:03.500> Jason<00:00:03.890> Middlebrook<00:00:04.310> and<00:00:04.609> I'm<00:00:05.419> an

00:00:05.559 --> 00:00:05.569 
my name is Jason Middlebrook and I'm an

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:07.719 
my name is Jason Middlebrook and I'm an
artist<00:00:05.899> so<00:00:06.620> when<00:00:06.740> I<00:00:06.769> first<00:00:07.039> came<00:00:07.220> up<00:00:07.279> here<00:00:07.459> at

00:00:07.719 --> 00:00:07.729 
artist so when I first came up here at

00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:10.450 
artist so when I first came up here at
first<00:00:07.939> I<00:00:08.090> was<00:00:08.240> just<00:00:08.450> drawn<00:00:08.750> by<00:00:09.200> the<00:00:09.260> space<00:00:09.650> the

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:10.460 
first I was just drawn by the space the

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.250 
first I was just drawn by the space the
verticality<00:00:10.940> of<00:00:11.210> the<00:00:11.330> space<00:00:11.570> the<00:00:11.870> verticality

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:12.260 
verticality of the space the verticality

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.610 
verticality of the space the verticality
of<00:00:12.530> the<00:00:12.680> school<00:00:13.010> the<00:00:13.340> columns<00:00:13.820> and<00:00:14.510> so<00:00:15.500> my

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:15.620 
of the school the columns and so my

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.500 
of the school the columns and so my
initial<00:00:15.830> idea<00:00:16.279> was<00:00:16.340> to<00:00:16.580> do<00:00:16.700> something<00:00:17.060> of<00:00:17.330> some

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:17.510 
initial idea was to do something of some

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.740 
initial idea was to do something of some
kind<00:00:17.690> of<00:00:17.720> tower<00:00:18.020> or<00:00:18.380> something<00:00:18.740> vertical<00:00:19.720> so<00:00:20.720> I

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:20.750 
kind of tower or something vertical so I

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.779 
kind of tower or something vertical so I
got<00:00:21.140> this<00:00:21.289> idea<00:00:21.500> to<00:00:21.770> use<00:00:22.460> cardboard<00:00:24.789> the

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:25.789 
got this idea to use cardboard the

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.380 
got this idea to use cardboard the
primary<00:00:26.300> piece<00:00:26.990> was<00:00:27.529> a<00:00:27.890> 35<00:00:28.640> foot<00:00:28.910> stack<00:00:29.210> of

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
primary piece was a 35 foot stack of

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.750 
primary piece was a 35 foot stack of
cardboard<00:00:29.869> which<00:00:30.080> is<00:00:30.310> mimics<00:00:31.310> kind<00:00:31.580> of<00:00:31.670> the

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:31.760 
cardboard which is mimics kind of the

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.760 
cardboard which is mimics kind of the
columns<00:00:32.210> the<00:00:32.480> four<00:00:32.689> column<00:00:33.050> central<00:00:33.410> columns

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:33.770 
columns the four column central columns

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.450 
columns the four column central columns
that<00:00:33.980> hold<00:00:34.760> up<00:00:34.940> the<00:00:34.970> actual<00:00:35.420> museum<00:00:36.070> we<00:00:37.070> had<00:00:37.250> to

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
that hold up the actual museum we had to

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.389 
that hold up the actual museum we had to
make<00:00:37.700> basically<00:00:38.660> a<00:00:38.980> structure<00:00:39.980> for<00:00:40.309> the

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:40.399 
make basically a structure for the

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:46.660 
make basically a structure for the
cardboard<00:00:40.940> to<00:00:41.059> fit<00:00:41.270> on<00:00:41.390> to<00:00:44.800> my<00:00:45.800> intention<00:00:46.430> was

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
cardboard to fit on to my intention was

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.430 
cardboard to fit on to my intention was
it<00:00:46.910> for<00:00:47.270> it<00:00:47.329> to<00:00:47.390> look<00:00:47.660> like<00:00:47.690> it<00:00:48.020> was<00:00:48.050> literally

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
it for it to look like it was literally

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.410 
it for it to look like it was literally
stacked<00:00:48.890> in<00:00:49.430> Florida<00:00:49.820> ceiling

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
stacked in Florida ceiling

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.380 
stacked in Florida ceiling
that<00:00:50.930> was<00:00:51.110> a<00:00:51.140> tricky<00:00:51.590> kind<00:00:51.770> of<00:00:51.920> engineering

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
that was a tricky kind of engineering

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.459 
that was a tricky kind of engineering
project<00:00:53.390> that<00:00:53.510> Jeffrey<00:00:53.930> has<00:00:54.050> been<00:00:54.200> really

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:54.469 
project that Jeffrey has been really

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:57.100 
project that Jeffrey has been really
wonderful<00:00:55.219> about<00:00:55.280> he<00:00:55.550> kind<00:00:55.790> of<00:00:55.989> more<00:00:56.989> or<00:00:57.079> less

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
wonderful about he kind of more or less

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.389 
wonderful about he kind of more or less
built<00:00:57.530> the<00:00:57.680> thing<00:00:57.800> himself

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
built the thing himself

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:00.970 
built the thing himself
once<00:00:58.969> Jeff<00:00:59.809> we<00:00:59.989> figure<00:01:00.260> out<00:01:00.320> how<00:01:00.530> to<00:01:00.590> design

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
once Jeff we figure out how to design

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.100 
once Jeff we figure out how to design
that<00:01:01.039> we<00:01:01.340> talked<00:01:01.610> about<00:01:01.730> it<00:01:02.059> if<00:01:02.300> it<00:01:02.690> went

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
that we talked about it if it went

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:11.710 
that we talked about it if it went
together<00:01:03.260> pretty<00:01:03.620> smoothly<00:01:10.330> and<00:01:11.330> then<00:01:11.600> the

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
together pretty smoothly and then the

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.830 
together pretty smoothly and then the
other<00:01:11.930> elements<00:01:13.119> there's<00:01:14.119> other<00:01:14.330> cardboard

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
other elements there's other cardboard

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.899 
other elements there's other cardboard
paintings<00:01:15.320> that<00:01:16.040> are<00:01:16.100> these<00:01:16.610> kind<00:01:16.820> of

looking onto a cityscape and then in the

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.660 
looking onto a cityscape and then in the
West<00:01:27.200> gallery<00:01:27.680> there's<00:01:28.130> going<00:01:28.280> to<00:01:28.340> be<00:01:28.430> this

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
West gallery there's going to be this

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.160 
West gallery there's going to be this
installation<00:01:29.090> of<00:01:29.509> this<00:01:29.630> kind<00:01:29.900> of<00:01:30.400> mound<00:01:31.400> of

installation of this kind of mound of

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.450 
installation of this kind of mound of
buildings<00:01:33.170> basically<00:01:33.740> a<00:01:33.770> building<00:01:34.220> blocks

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
buildings basically a building blocks

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.609 
buildings basically a building blocks
made<00:01:34.850> up<00:01:35.000> of<00:01:35.119> cardboard<00:01:35.540> boxes<00:01:37.360> downstairs

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
made up of cardboard boxes downstairs

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:40.870 
made up of cardboard boxes downstairs
the<00:01:39.619> majority<00:01:40.070> of<00:01:40.100> the<00:01:40.250> drawings<00:01:40.700> are<00:01:40.850> from

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
the majority of the drawings are from

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.020 
the majority of the drawings are from
2008<00:01:41.750> but<00:01:42.470> I<00:01:42.500> draw<00:01:42.860> a<00:01:42.890> lot<00:01:43.220> that's<00:01:43.490> a<00:01:43.640> big<00:01:43.820> part

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
2008 but I draw a lot that's a big part

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.569 
2008 but I draw a lot that's a big part
of<00:01:44.150> my<00:01:44.270> practice<00:01:44.509> and<00:01:45.079> some<00:01:45.950> of<00:01:46.040> them<00:01:46.130> go<00:01:46.340> far

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:46.579 
of my practice and some of them go far

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:49.920 
of my practice and some of them go far
back<00:01:46.820> as<00:01:47.000> 2002<00:01:47.869> so<00:01:48.560> there's

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
back as 2002 so there's

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.550 
back as 2002 so there's
there's<00:01:50.530> about<00:01:50.920> 11<00:01:51.100> drawings<00:01:51.910> that<00:01:52.210> span<00:01:52.630> six

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
there's about 11 drawings that span six

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.560 
there's about 11 drawings that span six
or<00:01:53.680> seven<00:01:53.950> years<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:55.420> front<00:01:55.840> lobby<00:01:56.110> is<00:01:57.570> made

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
or seven years the front lobby is made

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.590 
or seven years the front lobby is made
up<00:01:58.780> of<00:01:58.960> these<00:01:59.620> kind<00:01:59.890> of<00:01:59.950> signs<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:01.420> they're

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
up of these kind of signs and they're

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.870 
up of these kind of signs and they're
like<00:02:01.810> notes<00:02:02.440> to<00:02:02.650> myself<00:02:02.800> things<00:02:03.580> I've<00:02:03.730> heard

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
like notes to myself things I've heard

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.620 
like notes to myself things I've heard
on<00:02:04.000> the<00:02:04.120> radio<00:02:04.240> things<00:02:04.750> I've<00:02:04.930> read<00:02:06.330> pieces<00:02:07.330> of

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
on the radio things I've read pieces of

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.090 
on the radio things I've read pieces of
art<00:02:07.810> that<00:02:08.020> I've<00:02:08.110> imagined<00:02:08.649> that<00:02:08.710> I<00:02:08.830> want<00:02:09.040> to

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
art that I've imagined that I want to

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.190 
art that I've imagined that I want to
make<00:02:09.310> that<00:02:09.610> I<00:02:09.729> can't<00:02:10.000> make<00:02:10.210> that<00:02:10.660> would<00:02:11.080> be

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
make that I can't make that would be

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.130 
make that I can't make that would be
ridiculous<00:02:11.770> to<00:02:11.920> try<00:02:12.040> to<00:02:12.160> make<00:02:12.430> I<00:02:13.110> did<00:02:14.110> a

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
ridiculous to try to make I did a

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.400 
ridiculous to try to make I did a
drawing<00:02:14.380> called<00:02:15.220> little<00:02:15.580> glass<00:02:15.790> so<00:02:16.570> the<00:02:17.140> title

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
drawing called little glass so the title

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.690

gonna see a sculpture but I think that

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.610

itself<00:03:06.040> there's<00:03:06.610> a<00:03:06.730> lot<00:03:06.910> of<00:03:07.320> value

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
itself there's a lot of value

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.270 
itself there's a lot of value
it'll<00:03:10.970> be<00:03:11.120> recycled<00:03:11.780> as<00:03:11.959> if<00:03:12.170> it<00:03:12.830> was<00:03:12.980> on<00:03:13.130> its

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
it'll be recycled as if it was on its

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.300 
it'll be recycled as if it was on its
way<00:03:13.340> to<00:03:13.490> being<00:03:13.730> recycled<00:03:14.120> so<00:03:14.770> we<00:03:15.770> just<00:03:15.950> kind<00:03:16.250> of

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
way to being recycled so we just kind of

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.360 
way to being recycled so we just kind of
it<00:03:16.819> took<00:03:17.000> a<00:03:17.150> little<00:03:17.270> detour<00:03:17.920> which<00:03:18.920> i<00:03:19.040> think<00:03:19.100> is

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370 
it took a little detour which i think is

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.699 
it took a little detour which i think is
an<00:03:19.490> important<00:03:20.000> educational<00:03:20.150> detour<00:03:21.080> you<00:03:21.590> know

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709

it<00:03:21.890> it<00:03:22.580> turned<00:03:22.970> on<00:03:23.600> its<00:03:23.870> waves<00:03:24.110> the<00:03:24.319> recycling

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
it it turned on its waves the recycling

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.809 
it it turned on its waves the recycling
bin<00:03:25.580> and<00:03:25.880> we<00:03:26.690> got<00:03:26.870> to<00:03:27.050> do<00:03:27.200> something<00:03:27.590> with<00:03:27.739> it

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:27.819 
bin and we got to do something with it
