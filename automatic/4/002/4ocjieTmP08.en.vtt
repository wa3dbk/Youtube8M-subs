thing on the backhand backhand is a

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.359 
thing on the backhand backhand is a
little<00:01:39.899> bit<00:01:40.020> harder<00:01:40.409> because<00:01:40.950> we're<00:01:41.249> gonna

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
little bit harder because we're gonna

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.260 
little bit harder because we're gonna
have<00:01:41.459> to<00:01:41.520> get<00:01:41.669> rid<00:01:41.819> of<00:01:41.849> it<00:01:42.029> a<00:01:42.060> little<00:01:42.179> bit

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
have to get rid of it a little bit

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.269 
have to get rid of it a little bit
quicker<00:01:42.479> it's<00:01:43.169> a<00:01:43.319> little<00:01:43.529> bit<00:01:43.619> longer<00:01:43.919> of<00:01:44.099> a

00:01:44.269 --> 00:01:44.279 
quicker it's a little bit longer of a

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:46.699 
quicker it's a little bit longer of a
throw<00:01:44.520> because<00:01:44.729> it's<00:01:44.880> in<00:01:44.999> the<00:01:45.090> hole<00:01:45.270> but<00:01:46.259> same

00:01:46.699 --> 00:01:46.709 
throw because it's in the hole but same

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:49.039

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.089 
the ball whether it's in front of us it
should<00:02:03.329> be<00:02:03.569> one<00:02:03.840> step<00:02:04.079> after<00:02:04.319> we<00:02:04.590> catch<00:02:04.829> it<00:02:04.979> we

00:02:05.089 --> 00:02:05.099 
should be one step after we catch it we

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:07.190 
should be one step after we catch it we
deliver<00:02:05.429> the<00:02:05.579> ball<00:02:05.729> alright<00:02:06.359> we<00:02:06.899> want<00:02:07.049> to

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
catch the ball

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.500 
catch the ball
our<00:02:09.830> front<00:02:10.190> our<00:02:10.550> left<00:02:10.819> front<00:02:11.120> foot<00:02:11.330> is<00:02:11.480> going

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
our front our left front foot is going

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.059 
our front our left front foot is going
to<00:02:11.720> be<00:02:11.810> a<00:02:11.840> little<00:02:12.080> bit<00:02:12.260> in<00:02:12.409> front<00:02:12.650> of<00:02:12.739> our<00:02:12.890> back

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
to be a little bit in front of our back

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.020 
to be a little bit in front of our back
foot<00:02:13.340> so<00:02:14.030> when<00:02:14.989> we<00:02:15.140> receive<00:02:15.650> the<00:02:15.830> ball<00:02:16.030> it

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
foot so when we receive the ball it

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.490 
foot so when we receive the ball it
should<00:02:17.090> look<00:02:17.629> like<00:02:17.959> that<00:02:19.239> rather<00:02:20.239> than<00:02:20.599> that

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
should look like that rather than that

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.149 
should look like that rather than that
right<00:02:21.739> there

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:22.159 
right there

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:23.830 
right there
okay<00:02:22.640> so<00:02:22.700> it's<00:02:22.940> going<00:02:23.030> to<00:02:23.090> open<00:02:23.390> this<00:02:23.450> up<00:02:23.659> and

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
okay so it's going to open this up and

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.300 
okay so it's going to open this up and
it's<00:02:24.349> a<00:02:24.409> little<00:02:24.500> bit<00:02:24.650> easier<00:02:24.950> to<00:02:25.010> throw<00:02:25.190> the

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
it's a little bit easier to throw the

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:26.440 
it's a little bit easier to throw the
ball<00:02:25.430> when<00:02:25.610> we<00:02:25.670> start<00:02:25.910> it<00:02:25.970> that<00:02:26.030> way

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
ball when we start it that way

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.729 
ball when we start it that way
all<00:02:27.080> right<00:02:27.700> so<00:02:28.700> we're<00:02:28.879> gonna<00:02:29.379> catch<00:02:30.379> the<00:02:30.560> ball

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
all right so we're gonna catch the ball

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:35.619 
all right so we're gonna catch the ball
here<00:02:31.720> it's<00:02:32.720> gonna<00:02:32.840> be<00:02:33.019> one<00:02:33.230> step<00:02:33.590> boom<00:02:34.430> and<00:02:34.849> a

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:35.629 
here it's gonna be one step boom and a

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:40.210 
here it's gonna be one step boom and a
throw<00:02:35.900> okay<00:02:38.290> the<00:02:39.290> worst<00:02:39.440> thing<00:02:39.680> a<00:02:39.769> young<00:02:39.950> kid

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
throw okay the worst thing a young kid

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.589 
throw okay the worst thing a young kid
could<00:02:40.400> do<00:02:40.549> is<00:02:40.700> get<00:02:40.879> into<00:02:41.060> the<00:02:41.180> habit<00:02:41.360> of<00:02:41.540> taking

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 
could do is get into the habit of taking

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:43.270 
could do is get into the habit of taking
a<00:02:41.900> lot<00:02:42.049> of<00:02:42.079> steps<00:02:42.230> in<00:02:42.560> between<00:02:42.590> his<00:02:43.010> throws

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
a lot of steps in between his throws

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.759 
a lot of steps in between his throws
alright<00:02:43.819> most<00:02:44.780> little<00:02:44.959> leaguers<00:02:45.349> look<00:02:45.590> like

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
alright most little leaguers look like

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:48.250 
alright most little leaguers look like
this<00:02:45.980> they<00:02:46.250> catch<00:02:46.459> the<00:02:46.670> ball<00:02:46.810> usually<00:02:47.810> back

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
this they catch the ball usually back

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.819 
this they catch the ball usually back
here<00:02:48.680> and<00:02:49.239> then<00:02:50.239> they<00:02:50.510> come<00:02:50.900> up<00:02:50.930> you<00:02:51.560> take<00:02:51.769> a

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:51.829 
here and then they come up you take a

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:54.039 
here and then they come up you take a
couple<00:02:52.129> steps<00:02:52.310> and<00:02:53.299> then<00:02:53.540> they<00:02:53.690> throw<00:02:53.870> the

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
couple steps and then they throw the

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:56.110 
couple steps and then they throw the
ball<00:02:54.230> which<00:02:54.680> is<00:02:54.829> entirely<00:02:55.370> way<00:02:55.760> too<00:02:55.819> many

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
ball which is entirely way too many

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.229 
ball which is entirely way too many
steps<00:02:56.680> okay<00:02:57.680> so<00:02:58.310> we<00:02:58.430> want<00:02:58.579> to<00:02:58.640> be<00:02:58.730> one<00:02:58.940> the<00:02:59.060> two

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
steps okay so we want to be one the two

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:00.789 
steps okay so we want to be one the two
steps<00:02:59.540> once<00:02:59.840> we<00:02:59.959> catch<00:03:00.170> the<00:03:00.319> ball<00:03:00.470> to<00:03:00.650> the

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
steps once we catch the ball to the

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:01.479 
steps once we catch the ball to the
release<00:03:01.069> point

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
release point

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:06.460 
release point
so<00:03:02.150> catch<00:03:02.739> step<00:03:03.790> throw<00:03:04.790> as<00:03:05.060> we<00:03:05.750> take<00:03:05.989> that<00:03:06.200> step

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
so catch step throw as we take that step

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:08.470 
so catch step throw as we take that step
that<00:03:06.799> ball<00:03:07.370> is<00:03:07.519> coming<00:03:07.640> up<00:03:07.940> and<00:03:08.090> out<00:03:08.209> of<00:03:08.359> our
