 extract and he 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:04.469
 then remove the front bottom 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.469
 exhaust manifold catalyst 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.990
 front catalysts will be replaced by

 universal 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:21.510
 back to flame arrestor to save 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:27.540
 geometry construction boil sugar 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:27.540
 then the catalyst is cut off from the body 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.939
 old tote extract 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:44.080
 it has fallen into disrepair and will be replaced 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.080
 on a new universal catalyst 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.050
 establish a new catalyst and 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:59.150
 secured by welding in the housing then places 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:02.470
 universal catalyst compounds with 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:07.060
 body thoroughly boil 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.060
 cut unnecessary retainers 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:20.040
 welding spots paint heat resistant 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:22.760
 paint similarly come with the second 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.760
 catalyst 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:33.239
 we are revayet retainer now take 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:36.620

00:03:51.990 --> 00:04:02.540
 the joints of the corrugations by the tube also 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:02.540
 boil cuts the retainer 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:07.409
 and remove it 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:16.240
 front lower catalyst 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.240
 set on a regular place 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:25.520
 fix the flange connection 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:40.810
 then install the front upper 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:44.830
 catalyst are also set or 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:49.629
 no pipe tightens flange 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:52.539
 connection into place 3 

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:56.759
 rear catalyst will be installed 

00:04:52.539 --> 00:05:01.210
 flame arrester sprint flame arrester 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:05:04.979
 with outer layer made of stainless 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:06.849
 steel to install it 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:11.169
 makes a small repair 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:14.050
 the offspring is fixed by welding in place 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:14.740
 catalysts and stations days and carefully 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:20.469
 boil 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:23.620
 and so installed two catalysts new 

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:25.810
 corrugation and flame arrestor repair is over and 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.610
 warranty on all work performed and 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:29.849
 installed one and a half 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.849
