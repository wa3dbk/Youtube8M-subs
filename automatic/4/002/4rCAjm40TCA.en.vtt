the this Luke and greater detail because

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.490 
the this Luke and greater detail because
it's<00:01:55.290> really<00:01:55.380> pretty<00:01:55.590> cool<00:01:57.259> first<00:01:58.259> off<00:01:58.409> you

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
it's really pretty cool first off you

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.469 
it's really pretty cool first off you
can<00:01:58.619> see<00:01:58.799> how<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.100> lightsabers<00:01:59.850> let's<00:02:00.119> start

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
can see how the lightsabers let's start

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.950 
can see how the lightsabers let's start
there<00:02:01.009> see<00:02:02.009> how<00:02:02.159> they<00:02:02.310> were<00:02:02.369> much<00:02:02.700> more<00:02:02.969> the

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
there see how they were much more the

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.190 
there see how they were much more the
shape<00:02:04.259> of<00:02:04.439> them<00:02:04.530> was<00:02:04.680> far<00:02:04.920> different<00:02:06.200> they've

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
shape of them was far different they've

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.089 
shape of them was far different they've
got<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.469> kind<00:02:07.619> of<00:02:07.770> bulb<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.759> they<00:02:09.860> aren't<00:02:10.860> a

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
got the kind of bulb and they aren't a

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.800 
got the kind of bulb and they aren't a
solid<00:02:11.520> blade<00:02:11.700> they've<00:02:12.120> almost<00:02:12.390> got<00:02:12.660> this

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
solid blade they've almost got this

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.910 
solid blade they've almost got this
tapered<00:02:13.349> look<00:02:13.530> too

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
tapered look too

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.949 
tapered look too
I<00:02:14.000> don't<00:02:15.000> know<00:02:15.060> how<00:02:15.209> to<00:02:15.270> describe<00:02:15.390> it<00:02:15.750> but<00:02:15.870> a

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
I don't know how to describe it but a

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.089 
I don't know how to describe it but a
friend<00:02:16.080> of<00:02:16.170> mine<00:02:16.319> looked<00:02:16.500> at<00:02:16.620> and<00:02:16.740> she<00:02:16.890> thought

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
friend of mine looked at and she thought

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:20.330 
friend of mine looked at and she thought
that<00:02:17.250> they<00:02:17.400> look<00:02:17.790> more<00:02:17.970> elegant<00:02:18.000> and<00:02:18.690> I<00:02:19.340> guess

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
that they look more elegant and I guess

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.740 
that they look more elegant and I guess
for<00:02:20.550> lack<00:02:20.580> of<00:02:20.700> a<00:02:20.910> better<00:02:20.940> word<00:02:21.150> I<00:02:21.420> have<00:02:21.599> to

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
for lack of a better word I have to

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:22.970 
for lack of a better word I have to
agree<00:02:21.840> with<00:02:22.050> her<00:02:22.349> I<00:02:22.380> think<00:02:22.530> they<00:02:22.800> look<00:02:22.920> pretty

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
agree with her I think they look pretty

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.850 
agree with her I think they look pretty
cool<00:02:23.370> that's<00:02:24.090> also<00:02:24.470> present<00:02:25.470> on<00:02:25.500> the<00:02:25.650> Vator

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
cool that's also present on the Vator

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.800 
cool that's also present on the Vator
one<00:02:26.130> so<00:02:26.280> take<00:02:26.430> a<00:02:26.489> look<00:02:26.610> at<00:02:26.730> that<00:02:26.819> so<00:02:27.569> let's<00:02:27.720> take

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
one so take a look at that so let's take

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.350 
one so take a look at that so let's take
a<00:02:27.870> look<00:02:28.110> over<00:02:28.290> here<00:02:28.319> at<00:02:28.500> the<00:02:28.560> leg<00:02:28.770> I<00:02:29.209> like<00:02:30.209> the

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
a look over here at the leg I like the

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.390 
a look over here at the leg I like the
striations<00:02:30.989> on<00:02:31.140> this<00:02:31.319> suits<00:02:31.560> obviously<00:02:32.370> a

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
striations on this suits obviously a

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.290 
striations on this suits obviously a
much<00:02:32.610> more<00:02:32.819> colorful<00:02:33.180> figure<00:02:33.840> and<00:02:34.100> you<00:02:35.300> can

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
much more colorful figure and you can

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.510 
much more colorful figure and you can
see<00:02:36.510> that<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:37.110> way<00:02:37.410> that<00:02:37.770> the<00:02:37.890> modeling<00:02:38.340> and

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
see that the way that the modeling and

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.090 
see that the way that the modeling and
costume<00:02:39.060> choice<00:02:39.420> has<00:02:39.720> envisioned<00:02:40.200> here<00:02:40.650> plays

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
costume choice has envisioned here plays

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.190 
costume choice has envisioned here plays
out<00:02:41.310> I<00:02:41.340> mean<00:02:41.580> particularly<00:02:42.269> when<00:02:43.050> you're

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
out I mean particularly when you're

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.320 
out I mean particularly when you're
looking<00:02:43.590> at<00:02:43.739> the<00:02:43.890> mask<00:02:44.130> and<00:02:44.580> the<00:02:44.670> goggles<00:02:45.150> is

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
looking at the mask and the goggles is

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.390 
looking at the mask and the goggles is
but<00:02:45.660> even<00:02:46.110> more<00:02:46.319> than<00:02:46.530> just<00:02:47.010> you<00:02:47.190> know<00:02:47.250> he's

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
but even more than just you know he's

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.210 
but even more than just you know he's
got<00:02:47.550> this<00:02:47.700> purple<00:02:48.150> vest<00:02:48.420> and<00:02:48.780> orange<00:02:49.769> pants<00:02:50.100> I

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
got this purple vest and orange pants I

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.090 
got this purple vest and orange pants I
mean<00:02:50.489> it's<00:02:50.940> a<00:02:51.120> much<00:02:51.720> different<00:02:51.750> feel<00:02:52.739> in<00:02:53.040> terms

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
mean it's a much different feel in terms

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.670 
mean it's a much different feel in terms
of<00:02:53.549> costumer<00:02:54.180> choice<00:02:54.450> and<00:02:55.170> I<00:02:55.260> think<00:02:55.319> if<00:02:55.530> they

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
of costumer choice and I think if they

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.870 
of costumer choice and I think if they
would<00:02:55.830> have<00:02:55.860> gone<00:02:56.069> along<00:02:56.310> that<00:02:56.519> line<00:02:56.730> the

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
would have gone along that line the

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.820 
would have gone along that line the
movies<00:02:57.180> might<00:02:57.630> not<00:02:57.750> have<00:02:57.989> the<00:02:58.019> same<00:02:58.319> iconic

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
movies might not have the same iconic

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.890 
movies might not have the same iconic
look<00:02:59.010> as<00:02:59.220> it<00:02:59.580> is<00:02:59.730> now<00:02:59.910> the<00:02:59.970> costumes<00:03:00.540> tend<00:03:00.810> to

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
look as it is now the costumes tend to

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.190 
look as it is now the costumes tend to
be<00:03:01.220> working<00:03:02.220> class<00:03:02.459> clothes<00:03:02.850> for<00:03:03.510> people<00:03:04.019> in<00:03:04.110> a

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
be working class clothes for people in a

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.860 
be working class clothes for people in a
space<00:03:04.440> opera<00:03:04.830> for<00:03:05.160> what<00:03:05.340> it's<00:03:05.489> worth<00:03:05.549> this<00:03:06.269> has

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
space opera for what it's worth this has

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.259 
space opera for what it's worth this has
more<00:03:07.170> of<00:03:07.230> the<00:03:07.380> flamboyance<00:03:08.130> that<00:03:08.370> you<00:03:08.489> saw<00:03:08.880> in

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
more of the flamboyance that you saw in

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:12.050 
more of the flamboyance that you saw in
episodes<00:03:09.690> one<00:03:09.900> through<00:03:09.930> three<00:03:10.940> moving<00:03:11.940> on

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
episodes one through three moving on

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.620 
episodes one through three moving on
from<00:03:12.239> Luke<00:03:12.620> who<00:03:13.620> I<00:03:14.430> don't<00:03:15.239> know<00:03:15.330> what<00:03:15.480> to<00:03:15.600> say

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
from Luke who I don't know what to say

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.930 
from Luke who I don't know what to say
then<00:03:15.959> that's<00:03:16.260> really<00:03:16.500> cool<00:03:16.769> I'm<00:03:17.100> very<00:03:17.430> happy

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
then that's really cool I'm very happy

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.490 
then that's really cool I'm very happy
that<00:03:17.970> it<00:03:18.209> turned<00:03:18.390> out<00:03:18.540> the<00:03:18.690> way<00:03:18.780> it<00:03:18.810> was<00:03:18.930> I<00:03:19.290> like

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
that it turned out the way it was I like

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.990 
that it turned out the way it was I like
these<00:03:19.650> pieces<00:03:19.920> I<00:03:20.070> think<00:03:20.400> they're<00:03:20.549> great<00:03:20.790> I

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
these pieces I think they're great I

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.449 
these pieces I think they're great I
think<00:03:21.180> they<00:03:21.269> make<00:03:21.420> fantastic<00:03:21.750> statues<00:03:22.590> but<00:03:23.400> i

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
think they make fantastic statues but i

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:24.770 
think they make fantastic statues but i
don't<00:03:23.730> know<00:03:23.820> if<00:03:23.910> i<00:03:24.120> would<00:03:24.180> have<00:03:24.299> resonated

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
don't know if i would have resonated

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.390 
don't know if i would have resonated
with<00:03:25.049> a<00:03:25.079> guy<00:03:25.260> and<00:03:25.380> I'm<00:03:25.500> asking<00:03:25.859> goggles<00:03:26.280> as

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
with a guy and I'm asking goggles as

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.280 
with a guy and I'm asking goggles as
much<00:03:26.579> as<00:03:26.790> I<00:03:26.850> did<00:03:27.150> the<00:03:27.390> simple<00:03:27.750> farm<00:03:28.019> boy<00:03:28.230> from

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
much as I did the simple farm boy from

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.530 
much as I did the simple farm boy from
Tatooine<00:03:28.829> right<00:03:29.160> and<00:03:29.400> I<00:03:29.760> think<00:03:29.790> perhaps<00:03:30.150> maybe

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
Tatooine right and I think perhaps maybe

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.319 
Tatooine right and I think perhaps maybe
that<00:03:30.660> influenced<00:03:31.230> some<00:03:31.350> of<00:03:31.470> the<00:03:31.530> choice<00:03:32.329> darth

be<00:03:43.590> shown<00:03:43.829> together<00:03:43.980> they<00:03:44.459> obviously

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
be shown together they obviously

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.180 
be shown together they obviously
constitute<00:03:46.019> a<00:03:46.049> battle<00:03:46.350> but<00:03:46.799> they<00:03:46.950> aren't

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:50.100 
then we'll wrap up this round of cgt one

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.250 
then we'll wrap up this round of cgt one
thing<00:05:50.400> the<00:05:50.580> Darth<00:05:50.850> Vader<00:05:51.090> has<00:05:51.360> here<00:05:51.720> which<00:05:52.110> I

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:52.260 
thing the Darth Vader has here which I

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:55.610 
thing the Darth Vader has here which I
do<00:05:52.800> not<00:05:52.980> believe<00:05:53.220> i<00:05:53.670> have<00:05:53.820> ever<00:05:54.060> seen<00:05:54.510> and<00:05:54.870> this

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620 
do not believe i have ever seen and this

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:00.170 
do not believe i have ever seen and this
is<00:05:55.890> prior<00:05:56.640> to<00:05:56.880> he's<00:05:57.450> got<00:05:57.600> a<00:05:57.630> gun<00:05:57.960> i<00:05:58.880> let<00:05:59.880> me<00:05:59.970> see

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 
is prior to he's got a gun i let me see

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:04.340 
is prior to he's got a gun i let me see
if<00:06:00.360> you<00:06:00.450> can<00:06:00.600> see<00:06:00.780> it<00:06:00.840> he's<00:06:01.560> packing<00:06:01.980> heat<00:06:03.350> it's

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:04.350 
if you can see it he's packing heat it's

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:08.590 
if you can see it he's packing heat it's
holstered<00:06:04.920> and<00:06:05.220> this<00:06:05.340> particular<00:06:05.520> gun<00:06:06.920> is

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:08.600 
holstered and this particular gun is

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.870 
holstered and this particular gun is
sculpted<00:06:09.600> so<00:06:09.810> it<00:06:09.870> doesn't<00:06:10.110> actually<00:06:10.230> come<00:06:10.560> out

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:10.880 
sculpted so it doesn't actually come out

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.190 
sculpted so it doesn't actually come out
but<00:06:11.880> just<00:06:12.240> the<00:06:12.360> fact<00:06:12.390> that<00:06:12.660> he's<00:06:12.870> carrying

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:13.200 
but just the fact that he's carrying

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.590 
but just the fact that he's carrying
heat<00:06:13.440> I<00:06:13.650> think<00:06:14.070> shows<00:06:14.400> the<00:06:14.430> concept<00:06:15.210> level<00:06:15.510> of

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:15.600 
heat I think shows the concept level of

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.990 
heat I think shows the concept level of
this<00:06:15.780> its<00:06:16.050> prior<00:06:16.470> to<00:06:16.770> them<00:06:16.920> really<00:06:17.280> having<00:06:17.730> I

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:18.000 
this its prior to them really having I

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.120 
this its prior to them really having I
believe<00:06:18.690> flushed<00:06:19.140> out<00:06:19.290> the<00:06:19.440> entire<00:06:19.680> idea<00:06:19.920> of

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.130 
believe flushed out the entire idea of

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:22.190 
believe flushed out the entire idea of
the<00:06:20.280> force<00:06:20.550> and<00:06:20.790> the<00:06:21.510> connections<00:06:21.990> that<00:06:22.140> they

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:22.200 
the force and the connections that they

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.760 
the force and the connections that they
were<00:06:22.320> to<00:06:22.470> make<00:06:22.620> between<00:06:23.930> the<00:06:24.930> Jedi<00:06:25.290> even<00:06:25.680> the

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:25.770 
were to make between the Jedi even the

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:27.530 
were to make between the Jedi even the
Fallen<00:06:26.160> Jedi<00:06:26.190> who

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:27.540 
Fallen Jedi who

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:30.040 
Fallen Jedi who
of<00:06:27.630> course<00:06:27.870> of<00:06:28.020> the<00:06:28.080> Sith<00:06:28.320> such<00:06:28.590> as<00:06:28.740> Vader<00:06:28.890> and

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:30.050 
of course of the Sith such as Vader and

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:34.160 
of course of the Sith such as Vader and
the<00:06:31.050> principles<00:06:32.010> of<00:06:32.310> honor<00:06:33.210> in<00:06:33.570> some<00:06:33.780> case<00:06:33.960> but

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:34.170 
the principles of honor in some case but

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:36.680 
the principles of honor in some case but
also<00:06:34.290> just<00:06:34.440> the<00:06:34.650> idea<00:06:34.860> the<00:06:35.400> gun<00:06:36.060> is<00:06:36.240> a<00:06:36.270> lesser

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:36.690 
also just the idea the gun is a lesser

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:38.330 
also just the idea the gun is a lesser
weapon<00:06:37.020> and<00:06:37.260> although<00:06:37.740> you<00:06:37.800> know<00:06:38.010> you<00:06:38.070> see

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:38.340 
weapon and although you know you see

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:39.770 
weapon and although you know you see
Luke<00:06:38.760> using<00:06:39.090> and<00:06:39.210> he's<00:06:39.330> still<00:06:39.510> in<00:06:39.570> training

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:39.780 
Luke using and he's still in training

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:42.320 
Luke using and he's still in training
but<00:06:40.110> you<00:06:40.650> don't<00:06:40.890> ever<00:06:41.070> see<00:06:41.190> Vader<00:06:41.910> packing

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:42.330 
but you don't ever see Vader packing

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:43.820 
but you don't ever see Vader packing
heat<00:06:42.510> I<00:06:42.720> think<00:06:42.900> that's<00:06:43.050> kind<00:06:43.260> of<00:06:43.350> cool<00:06:43.530> that

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:43.830 
heat I think that's kind of cool that

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:46.400 
heat I think that's kind of cool that
you<00:06:44.010> can<00:06:44.130> see<00:06:44.340> here<00:06:44.790> he<00:06:45.060> still<00:06:45.270> was<00:06:45.510> yeah<00:06:46.140> so<00:06:46.320> as

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:46.410 
you can see here he still was yeah so as

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:48.890 
you can see here he still was yeah so as
an<00:06:46.560> additional<00:06:47.220> side<00:06:47.550> cow<00:06:47.880> he<00:06:48.540> doesn't<00:06:48.810> just

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:48.900 
an additional side cow he doesn't just

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:50.360 
an additional side cow he doesn't just
have<00:06:49.050> his<00:06:49.230> cape<00:06:49.590> which<00:06:49.800> is<00:06:49.920> well<00:06:50.100> known<00:06:50.250> for

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:50.370 
have his cape which is well known for

have his cape which is well known for
there's<00:06:50.580> this<00:06:50.670> lower<00:06:50.970> rope<00:06:51.330> which<00:06:52.230> was<00:06:52.770> also

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:52.950 
there's this lower rope which was also

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:56.470 
there's this lower rope which was also
struck<00:06:53.400> from<00:06:53.580> the<00:06:53.640> final<00:06:54.000> design<00:06:54.530> in<00:06:55.530> short

both<00:06:57.480> of<00:06:57.660> these<00:06:57.720> put<00:06:58.050> together<00:06:58.200> a<00:06:58.650> really<00:06:59.580> cool

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:00.410 
both of these put together a really cool

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:04.700 
both of these put together a really cool
