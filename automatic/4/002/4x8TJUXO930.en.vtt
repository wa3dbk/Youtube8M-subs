on a single single GPU card so it

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.310

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.630 
surround without 3d vision as well but
you'll<00:00:48.899> need<00:00:49.079> two<00:00:49.289> cards<00:00:49.620> for<00:00:49.829> that<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.190> this

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
you'll need two cards for that and this

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.340 
you'll need two cards for that and this
is<00:00:50.789> actually<00:00:51.270> one<00:00:51.570> of<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.780> few<00:00:52.020> situations

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
is actually one of the few situations

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.549 
is actually one of the few situations
where<00:00:52.980> I<00:00:53.010> would<00:00:53.250> really<00:00:53.579> recommend<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:55.050> card

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
where I would really recommend a card

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.680 
where I would really recommend a card
like<00:00:55.649> this<00:00:56.100> with<00:00:56.399> three<00:00:56.789> gigs<00:00:57.090> of<00:00:57.329> memory<00:00:57.360> and

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
like this with three gigs of memory and

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.090 
like this with three gigs of memory and
I'll<00:00:57.780> get<00:00:57.930> into<00:00:58.050> that<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.320> little<00:00:58.440> bit<00:00:58.649> more<00:00:58.829> why

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
I'll get into that a little bit more why

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.170 
I'll get into that a little bit more why
later

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
later

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.060

stuff that I mentioned before it's

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.000 
stuff that I mentioned before it's
compatible<00:01:03.780> with<00:01:04.019> Windows<00:01:04.290> 7<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:04.710> bloody<00:01:04.920> well

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
compatible with Windows 7 it bloody well

output<00:04:09.150> set<00:04:10.150> up<00:04:10.239> that<00:04:10.389> I<00:04:10.449> talked<00:04:10.690> about<00:04:10.930> so

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:11.079 
output set up that I talked about so

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:13.559 
output set up that I talked about so
we've<00:04:11.199> got<00:04:11.409> dual<00:04:11.769> DVI<00:04:12.069> full-sized<00:04:12.849> HDMI<00:04:13.060> and

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:13.569 
we've got dual DVI full-sized HDMI and

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:15.809 
we've got dual DVI full-sized HDMI and
DisplayPort<00:04:13.859> so<00:04:14.859> we'll<00:04:15.040> contrast<00:04:15.489> that<00:04:15.669> with

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:15.819 
DisplayPort so we'll contrast that with

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:18.870 
DisplayPort so we'll contrast that with
a<00:04:15.879> standard<00:04:16.359> GTX<00:04:16.840> 580<00:04:17.139> where<00:04:18.070> we<00:04:18.220> find<00:04:18.519> dual

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
a standard GTX 580 where we find dual

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.520 
a standard GTX 580 where we find dual
DVI<00:04:19.269> and<00:04:19.889> mini<00:04:20.889> HDMI<00:04:22.020> so<00:04:23.020> that's<00:04:23.169> a<00:04:23.260> little<00:04:23.409> bit

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
DVI and mini HDMI so that's a little bit

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:24.440 
DVI and mini HDMI so that's a little bit
different

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
different

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:28.980 
different
we<00:04:25.450> also<00:04:25.630> do<00:04:25.900> not<00:04:26.110> have<00:04:26.350> a<00:04:26.590> full<00:04:27.450> pci<00:04:28.450> bracket

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
we also do not have a full pci bracket

we also do not have a full pci bracket
width<00:04:29.380> for<00:04:29.830> exhaust<00:04:30.190> and<00:04:30.460> the<00:04:30.550> reason<00:04:30.790> for

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
width for exhaust and the reason for

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.970 
width for exhaust and the reason for
that<00:04:30.970> is<00:04:31.180> we<00:04:31.300> are<00:04:31.330> using<00:04:31.510> a<00:04:32.140> non-reference

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
that is we are using a non-reference

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.400 
that is we are using a non-reference
cooler<00:04:33.120> so<00:04:34.120> right<00:04:34.300> here<00:04:34.510> we're<00:04:34.720> using<00:04:34.750> kind<00:04:35.320> of

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
cooler so right here we're using kind of

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.900 
cooler so right here we're using kind of
a<00:04:35.560> dual<00:04:36.340> fan<00:04:36.670> these<00:04:36.910> look<00:04:37.240> like<00:04:37.480> oh<00:04:38.700> it's<00:04:39.700> hard

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
a dual fan these look like oh it's hard

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:41.940 
a dual fan these look like oh it's hard
to<00:04:40.060> say<00:04:40.270> I<00:04:40.300> think<00:04:40.720> they're<00:04:40.900> probably<00:04:41.200> 80<00:04:41.620> mils

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 
to say I think they're probably 80 mils

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.130 
to say I think they're probably 80 mils
but<00:04:42.220> they<00:04:42.340> might<00:04:42.520> be<00:04:42.550> seven<00:04:43.060> emails<00:04:43.300> I<00:04:43.630> can't

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:44.140 
but they might be seven emails I can't

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.140 
but they might be seven emails I can't
quite<00:04:44.320> tell<00:04:44.530> they're<00:04:44.980> low<00:04:45.190> profile<00:04:45.610> fans<00:04:45.940> this

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
quite tell they're low profile fans this

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.300 
quite tell they're low profile fans this
is<00:04:46.330> still<00:04:46.570> a<00:04:46.720> dual<00:04:46.960> slot<00:04:47.350> card<00:04:47.650> so<00:04:48.160> you<00:04:48.220> don't

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
is still a dual slot card so you don't

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.490 
is still a dual slot card so you don't
need<00:04:48.730> three<00:04:49.180> slots<00:04:49.660> for<00:04:49.900> the<00:04:49.960> card<00:04:50.200> itself

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
need three slots for the card itself

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:51.870 
need three slots for the card itself
though<00:04:50.710> I<00:04:50.830> would<00:04:51.040> still<00:04:51.280> recommend<00:04:51.460> leaving

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
though I would still recommend leaving

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.120 
though I would still recommend leaving
the<00:04:52.150> next<00:04:52.480> slot<00:04:52.660> over<00:04:52.870> vacant<00:04:53.380> so<00:04:53.860> that<00:04:54.010> these

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
the next slot over vacant so that these

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:55.590 
the next slot over vacant so that these
fans<00:04:54.400> do<00:04:54.670> have<00:04:54.850> some<00:04:55.030> room<00:04:55.210> to<00:04:55.240> breathe

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 
fans do have some room to breathe

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.720 
fans do have some room to breathe
most<00:04:56.200> of<00:04:56.350> the<00:04:56.440> exhaust<00:04:56.800> it<00:04:57.040> looks<00:04:57.190> like<00:04:57.400> due<00:04:57.580> to

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:57.730 
most of the exhaust it looks like due to

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:59.520 
most of the exhaust it looks like due to
the<00:04:57.850> shape<00:04:58.030> of<00:04:58.120> the<00:04:58.180> cooler<00:04:58.510> is<00:04:58.780> being<00:04:59.380> done

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
the shape of the cooler is being done

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:00.990 
the shape of the cooler is being done
out<00:04:59.680> the<00:04:59.830> back<00:04:59.980> of<00:05:00.010> the<00:05:00.190> card<00:05:00.430> here<00:05:00.670> where<00:05:00.940> you

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
out the back of the card here where you

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.390 
out the back of the card here where you
can<00:05:01.150> see<00:05:01.330> it's<00:05:01.450> just<00:05:01.690> full<00:05:01.870> of<00:05:01.900> dense<00:05:02.770> dense

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
can see it's just full of dense dense

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.670 
can see it's just full of dense dense
fins<00:05:03.910> that's<00:05:04.270> a<00:05:04.420> very<00:05:04.630> dense<00:05:04.960> aluminum<00:05:05.500> thin

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
fins that's a very dense aluminum thin

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.680 
fins that's a very dense aluminum thin
cooler<00:05:06.100> there's<00:05:06.640> your<00:05:06.820> two<00:05:06.970> fans<00:05:07.240> plugged<00:05:07.540> in

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
cooler there's your two fans plugged in

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.470 
cooler there's your two fans plugged in
so<00:05:07.840> this<00:05:07.960> is<00:05:08.110> a<00:05:08.140> fully<00:05:08.560> custom<00:05:09.070> PCB<00:05:09.490> not<00:05:10.240> just

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:10.480 
so this is a fully custom PCB not just

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.480 
so this is a fully custom PCB not just
the<00:05:10.600> colour<00:05:10.810> but<00:05:11.350> the<00:05:11.470> entire<00:05:11.710> PCB<00:05:12.220> design

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
the colour but the entire PCB design

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.030 
the colour but the entire PCB design
because<00:05:12.730> it<00:05:12.820> has<00:05:12.970> actual<00:05:13.960> fan<00:05:14.380> inputs<00:05:14.830> for

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:15.040 
because it has actual fan inputs for

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.840 
because it has actual fan inputs for
both<00:05:15.190> of<00:05:15.340> these<00:05:15.430> fans<00:05:15.760> rather<00:05:16.060> than<00:05:16.330> just<00:05:16.570> one

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:17.850 
both of these fans rather than just one

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:21.540 
both of these fans rather than just one
and<00:05:18.850> then<00:05:20.100> obviously<00:05:21.100> here<00:05:21.250> on<00:05:21.340> the<00:05:21.430> other

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
and then obviously here on the other

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.970 
and then obviously here on the other
side<00:05:21.790> so<00:05:21.970> you<00:05:22.000> can<00:05:22.210> see<00:05:22.270> the<00:05:22.600> the<00:05:23.410> fins<00:05:23.650> through

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:23.980 
side so you can see the the fins through

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:25.260 
side so you can see the the fins through
there<00:05:24.160> but<00:05:24.370> that<00:05:24.610> one's<00:05:24.790> not<00:05:24.940> gonna<00:05:25.090> be<00:05:25.210> able

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
there but that one's not gonna be able

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.360 
there but that one's not gonna be able
to<00:05:25.360> exhaust<00:05:25.690> as<00:05:25.870> much<00:05:26.110> should<00:05:26.740> be<00:05:26.770> okay<00:05:27.130> it's

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
to exhaust as much should be okay it's

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.130 
to exhaust as much should be okay it's
only<00:05:27.490> a<00:05:27.580> single<00:05:27.850> GPU<00:05:28.300> card<00:05:28.570> so<00:05:28.750> it's<00:05:28.870> not<00:05:28.930> like

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:29.140 
only a single GPU card so it's not like

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.320 
only a single GPU card so it's not like
we<00:05:29.290> have<00:05:29.440> to<00:05:29.560> worry<00:05:29.740> about<00:05:29.890> two<00:05:30.520> GPUs<00:05:30.880> getting

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 
we have to worry about two GPUs getting

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.270 
we have to worry about two GPUs getting
equal<00:05:31.480> cooling<00:05:31.960> or<00:05:32.080> anything<00:05:32.230> like<00:05:32.500> that<00:05:32.560> so<00:05:32.770> I

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 
equal cooling or anything like that so I

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:35.490 
equal cooling or anything like that so I
would<00:05:33.790> expect<00:05:33.910> it<00:05:34.270> to<00:05:34.300> perform<00:05:34.720> at<00:05:35.020> least<00:05:35.200> as

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
would expect it to perform at least as

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:36.930 
would expect it to perform at least as
well<00:05:35.530> as<00:05:35.710> the<00:05:35.980> stock<00:05:36.190> cooler<00:05:36.370> if<00:05:36.610> not<00:05:36.760> it

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:36.940 
well as the stock cooler if not it

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.250 
well as the stock cooler if not it
should<00:05:37.090> actually<00:05:37.300> be<00:05:37.510> better<00:05:37.810> and<00:05:38.050> you<00:05:38.080> look

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:38.260 
should actually be better and you look

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.650 
should actually be better and you look
at<00:05:38.350> this<00:05:38.440> to<00:05:38.590> God<00:05:38.740> how<00:05:39.610> many<00:05:39.790> fat<00:05:40.120> heat<00:05:40.450> pipes

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:40.660 
at this to God how many fat heat pipes

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.120 
at this to God how many fat heat pipes
is<00:05:40.870> that<00:05:41.020> on<00:05:41.200> there<00:05:41.380> it<00:05:41.650> looks<00:05:41.800> like<00:05:41.890> you<00:05:42.040> got

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.130 
is that on there it looks like you got

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:43.820 
is that on there it looks like you got
about<00:05:42.340> four<00:05:42.760> heat<00:05:43.000> pipes<00:05:43.210> in<00:05:43.420> there<00:05:43.600> I

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:43.830 
about four heat pipes in there I

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.990 
about four heat pipes in there I
carrying<00:05:44.830> heat<00:05:45.070> over<00:05:45.310> here<00:05:45.640> to<00:05:45.790> the<00:05:45.910> other

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 
carrying heat over here to the other

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.750 
carrying heat over here to the other
side<00:05:46.150> as<00:05:46.690> well<00:05:46.870> as<00:05:47.050> over<00:05:48.040> to<00:05:48.220> the<00:05:48.310> front<00:05:48.550> of<00:05:48.670> the

card<00:05:49.230> up<00:05:50.230> here<00:05:50.440> on<00:05:50.590> the<00:05:50.680> top<00:05:50.860> looks<00:05:51.370> fairly

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:51.640 
card up here on the top looks fairly

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.480 
card up here on the top looks fairly
standard<00:05:52.320> so<00:05:53.320> like<00:05:53.530> I<00:05:53.620> said<00:05:53.680> you<00:05:53.830> got<00:05:54.040> your<00:05:54.160> SLI

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:54.490 
standard so like I said you got your SLI

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:56.460 
standard so like I said you got your SLI
fingers<00:05:54.850> you've<00:05:55.060> also<00:05:55.180> got<00:05:55.510> a<00:05:55.540> four<00:05:55.960> pin<00:05:56.170> and<00:05:56.380> a

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:56.470 
fingers you've also got a four pin and a

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.050 
fingers you've also got a four pin and a
three<00:05:56.620> pin<00:05:56.800> connector<00:05:57.190> so<00:05:57.430> just<00:05:57.700> because<00:05:57.820> it

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:58.060 
three pin connector so just because it

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.120 
three pin connector so just because it
has<00:05:58.180> more<00:05:58.210> memory<00:05:58.620> doesn't<00:05:59.620> mean<00:05:59.770> that<00:05:59.980> it

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:00.130 
has more memory doesn't mean that it

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:01.860 
has more memory doesn't mean that it
needs<00:06:00.310> more<00:06:00.520> power<00:06:00.790> it<00:06:01.120> uses<00:06:01.480> the<00:06:01.570> same<00:06:01.720> amount

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:01.870 
needs more power it uses the same amount

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:04.680 
needs more power it uses the same amount
of<00:06:02.080> power<00:06:02.230> as<00:06:02.530> a<00:06:02.560> standard<00:06:03.040> GTX<00:06:03.490> 580<00:06:03.760> so<00:06:04.540> that's

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:04.690 
of power as a standard GTX 580 so that's

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:05.760 
of power as a standard GTX 580 so that's
pretty<00:06:04.870> much<00:06:04.960> everything<00:06:05.110> I<00:06:05.350> wanted<00:06:05.560> to<00:06:05.620> say

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:05.770 
pretty much everything I wanted to say

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:07.920 
pretty much everything I wanted to say
about<00:06:05.920> this<00:06:06.040> card<00:06:06.280> except<00:06:06.670> why<00:06:07.330> you<00:06:07.390> would<00:06:07.720> buy

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:07.930

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:11.620

talking about with a setup like that I

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:53.660 
talking about with a setup like that I
think<00:06:52.890> it<00:06:52.980> worked<00:06:53.100> let<00:06:53.220> is<00:06:53.340> it<00:06:53.430> something<00:06:53.640> like

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:53.670 
think it worked let is it something like

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:57.890 
think it worked let is it something like
12<00:06:54.000> megapixels<00:06:54.690> so<00:06:55.880> when<00:06:56.880> you're<00:06:57.060> in<00:06:57.150> SLI<00:06:57.600> you

00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:57.900 
12 megapixels so when you're in SLI you

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:59.450 
12 megapixels so when you're in SLI you
don't<00:06:58.110> actually<00:06:58.350> get<00:06:58.710> to<00:06:58.860> double<00:06:59.130> your<00:06:59.220> frame

00:06:59.450 --> 00:06:59.460 
don't actually get to double your frame

don't actually get to double your frame
buffer<00:06:59.820> when<00:06:59.970> you<00:07:00.060> put<00:07:00.210> two<00:07:00.330> cards<00:07:00.480> together

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:00.840

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.570
