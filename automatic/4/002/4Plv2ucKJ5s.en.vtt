hey<00:00:01.949> it's<00:00:02.190> Bruce<00:00:02.460> with<00:00:02.760> the<00:00:02.939> weeders<00:00:03.210> digest

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
hey it's Bruce with the weeders digest

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.749 
hey it's Bruce with the weeders digest
and<00:00:03.990> today<00:00:04.290> we're<00:00:04.770> looking<00:00:04.980> at<00:00:05.250> de-icing

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
and today we're looking at de-icing

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.600 
and today we're looking at de-icing
equipment<00:00:06.210> and<00:00:06.810> if<00:00:07.500> you've<00:00:07.649> got<00:00:08.010> a<00:00:08.040> doc<00:00:08.309> like

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
equipment and if you've got a doc like

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.360 
equipment and if you've got a doc like
I've<00:00:08.820> got<00:00:09.059> here<00:00:09.620> it<00:00:10.620> certainly<00:00:11.010> is<00:00:11.130> not<00:00:11.309> a

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
I've got here it certainly is not a

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.039 
I've got here it certainly is not a
doctor<00:00:11.759> would<00:00:11.849> be<00:00:12.000> able<00:00:12.059> to<00:00:12.240> stand<00:00:12.420> up<00:00:12.660> to<00:00:12.690> ice

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
doctor would be able to stand up to ice

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.530 
doctor would be able to stand up to ice
movement<00:00:13.440> and<00:00:13.799> ice<00:00:13.950> pressure<00:00:14.400> and<00:00:14.759> so<00:00:15.299> the

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
movement and ice pressure and so the

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.269 
movement and ice pressure and so the
great<00:00:15.900> opportunity<00:00:16.199> is<00:00:16.650> to<00:00:16.770> be<00:00:16.890> able<00:00:16.980> to<00:00:17.130> just

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
great opportunity is to be able to just

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:18.980 
great opportunity is to be able to just
take<00:00:17.520> something<00:00:17.880> like<00:00:18.150> this<00:00:18.270> which<00:00:18.539> is<00:00:18.690> a<00:00:18.720> half

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
take something like this which is a half

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.609 
take something like this which is a half
horsepower<00:00:19.410> it<00:00:20.189> has<00:00:20.400> a<00:00:20.430> prop<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.150> so<00:00:21.840> it's

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
horsepower it has a prop and so it's

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.730 
horsepower it has a prop and so it's
able<00:00:23.430> to<00:00:23.699> move<00:00:23.880> water<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:24.840> clear<00:00:25.500> an<00:00:25.619> area

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
able to move water and clear an area

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.450 
able to move water and clear an area
around<00:00:26.490> Oh<00:00:26.849> up<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.330> 50<00:00:27.660> feet<00:00:28.130> across<00:00:29.130> and

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
around Oh up to 50 feet across and

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.250 
around Oh up to 50 feet across and
that's<00:00:29.640> very<00:00:30.029> dependent<00:00:30.599> upon<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.810> lot<00:00:31.109> of

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
that's very dependent upon a lot of

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.860 
that's very dependent upon a lot of
different<00:00:31.850> factors<00:00:32.850> as<00:00:33.360> you<00:00:33.510> might<00:00:33.750> imagine

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
different factors as you might imagine

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.290 
different factors as you might imagine
it<00:00:34.380> depends<00:00:34.710> upon<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:35.070> flow<00:00:35.340> depends<00:00:36.210> upon

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
it depends upon the flow depends upon

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.790 
it depends upon the flow depends upon
the<00:00:36.630> rate<00:00:37.530> of<00:00:37.790> the<00:00:38.790> water<00:00:39.030> temperature

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
the rate of the water temperature

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.990 
the rate of the water temperature
surface<00:00:40.800> temperature<00:00:41.399> all<00:00:41.610> those<00:00:41.760> type<00:00:41.969> of

surface temperature all those type of

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000 
surface temperature all those type of
things<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.450> ultimately<00:00:42.960> we<00:00:43.590> can<00:00:43.770> give<00:00:43.920> you

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
things and ultimately we can give you

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.069 
things and ultimately we can give you
the<00:00:44.160> advice<00:00:44.430> you<00:00:44.489> need<00:00:44.700> but<00:00:45.149> it's<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.539> the

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
the advice you need but it's the the

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.500 
the advice you need but it's the the
depth<00:00:46.350> of<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.590> surrounding<00:00:47.039> water

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
depth of the surrounding water

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.819 
depth of the surrounding water
obstructions<00:00:48.510> in<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.750> water<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.289> the

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
obstructions in the water and the

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.220 
obstructions in the water and the
geographic<00:00:50.489> location<00:00:51.090> those<00:00:51.719> are<00:00:51.930> all<00:00:51.960> the

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
geographic location those are all the

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.660 
geographic location those are all the
things<00:00:52.260> that<00:00:52.590> we<00:00:52.680> need<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.860> discuss<00:00:53.190> now<00:00:53.520> it's

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
things that we need to discuss now it's

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.270 
things that we need to discuss now it's
very<00:00:53.969> easy<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.420> put<00:00:54.719> on<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:55.649> install<00:00:56.039> one<00:00:56.250> of

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
very easy to put on to install one of

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.900 
very easy to put on to install one of
these<00:00:56.460> in<00:00:57.420> this<00:00:57.930> case<00:00:58.109> I'm<00:00:58.469> simply<00:00:58.980> putting<00:00:59.579> a

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
these in this case I'm simply putting a

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.529 
these in this case I'm simply putting a
rope<00:01:00.570> on<00:01:00.809> each<00:01:01.230> end<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.280> area<00:01:03.149> that<00:01:03.300> I<00:01:03.359> want

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
rope on each end of the area that I want

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.630 
rope on each end of the area that I want
to<00:01:03.629> keep<00:01:03.780> open<00:01:04.140> on<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.350> dock<00:01:04.559> post<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.070> then

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
to keep open on the dock post and then

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.700 
to keep open on the dock post and then
simply<00:01:06.330> dropping<00:01:06.720> it<00:01:06.960> into<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.260> water<00:01:07.439> and

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
simply dropping it into the water and

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.760 
simply dropping it into the water and
you<00:01:07.890> can<00:01:08.040> see<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:08.960> this<00:01:09.960> is<00:01:10.229> just<00:01:10.619> a

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
you can see that that this is just a

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.649 
you can see that that this is just a
half<00:01:10.979> horsepower<00:01:11.310> we<00:01:11.580> sell<00:01:11.790> them<00:01:11.909> half<00:01:12.180> up<00:01:12.479> to

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
half horsepower we sell them half up to

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.260 
half horsepower we sell them half up to
you<00:01:13.590> know<00:01:13.710> one<00:01:13.950> horsepower<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.729> or<00:01:14.909> spar<00:01:15.119> we

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
you know one horsepower to or spar we

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.820 
you know one horsepower to or spar we
have<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.420> lot<00:01:15.689> of<00:01:15.720> options<00:01:16.229> when<00:01:16.380> it<00:01:16.409> comes<00:01:16.500> to

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
have a lot of options when it comes to

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.770 
have a lot of options when it comes to
our<00:01:16.890> de-icers<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:18.150> number<00:01:18.270> of<00:01:18.479> different

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
our de-icers and a number of different

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.960 
our de-icers and a number of different
brands<00:01:19.020> but<00:01:19.350> this<00:01:19.560> is<00:01:19.740> not<00:01:19.920> where<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:20.820> would

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
brands but this is not where you would

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.609 
brands but this is not where you would
ever<00:01:21.060> want<00:01:21.180> to<00:01:21.450> have<00:01:21.570> that<00:01:21.720> kind<00:01:21.990> of<00:01:22.049> flow<00:01:22.320> and

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
ever want to have that kind of flow and

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.950 
ever want to have that kind of flow and
the<00:01:22.979> reason<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.580> is<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:24.090> although<00:01:24.600> of<00:01:24.750> that

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
the reason is is that although of that

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.260 
the reason is is that although of that
kind<00:01:25.229> of<00:01:25.409> flow<00:01:26.280> activity<00:01:26.820> would<00:01:26.970> certainly

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
kind of flow activity would certainly

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.600 
kind of flow activity would certainly
keep<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:28.320> water<00:01:28.590> open<00:01:29.189> in<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.430> area

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
keep the water open in that area

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.819 
keep the water open in that area
ultimately<00:01:30.329> wanted<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.720> do<00:01:30.840> is<00:01:31.020> be<00:01:31.170> as<00:01:31.290> low<00:01:31.680> in

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
ultimately wanted to do is be as low in

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.219 
ultimately wanted to do is be as low in
the<00:01:31.890> water<00:01:31.979> as<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.520> can<00:01:32.640> so<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:33.960> can

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
the water as you can so that you can

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.679 
the water as you can so that you can
close<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.220> bottom<00:01:35.549> where<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:36.180> earth<00:01:36.390> is

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
close to the bottom where the earth is

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.660 
close to the bottom where the earth is
warming<00:01:36.780> up<00:01:37.409> that<00:01:37.439> water<00:01:37.860> down<00:01:38.250> there<00:01:38.490> and

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
warming up that water down there and

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.230 
warming up that water down there and
you're<00:01:39.180> driving<00:01:39.570> that<00:01:39.990> water<00:01:40.290> upward<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:42.090> be

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
you're driving that water upward to be

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.080 
you're driving that water upward to be
able<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.740> you<00:01:43.740> know<00:01:43.860> keep<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.460> eat<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.939> ice

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
able to you know keep and eat the ice

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.880 
able to you know keep and eat the ice
and<00:01:45.360> it<00:01:45.420> will<00:01:45.840> it<00:01:46.020> will<00:01:46.049> literally<00:01:46.470> eat<00:01:46.619> the

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
and it will it will literally eat the

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.280 
and it will it will literally eat the
ice<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.579> get<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:48.060> other<00:01:48.659> options<00:01:49.110> to

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
ice and you get the other options to

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.889 
ice and you get the other options to
have<00:01:49.439> it<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.619> horizontal<00:01:50.220> flow<00:01:50.600> and<00:01:51.600> we'll<00:01:51.780> look

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
have it a horizontal flow and we'll look

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.170 
have it a horizontal flow and we'll look
at<00:01:52.020> some<00:01:52.079> options<00:01:52.380> there<00:01:53.009> now<00:01:53.520> another<00:01:53.790> great

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
at some options there now another great

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.789 
at some options there now another great
option<00:01:54.420> is<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.899> be<00:01:54.990> able<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.259> just<00:01:55.320> literally

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
option is to be able to just literally

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.340 
option is to be able to just literally
take<00:01:56.159> it<00:01:56.450> put<00:01:57.450> it<00:01:57.540> down<00:01:57.689> on<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.840> bottom<00:01:57.990> like

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
take it put it down on the bottom like

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.139 
take it put it down on the bottom like
you<00:01:58.469> see<00:01:58.680> here<00:01:58.710> this<00:01:59.040> would<00:01:59.219> be<00:01:59.369> more<00:01:59.610> typical

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
you see here this would be more typical

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.940 
you see here this would be more typical
what<00:02:00.270> you'd<00:02:00.450> see<00:02:00.689> on<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.960> surface<00:02:01.110> not<00:02:01.740> that

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
what you'd see on the surface not that

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.580 
what you'd see on the surface not that
big<00:02:02.310> flow<00:02:02.610> and<00:02:02.909> so<00:02:03.479> it<00:02:03.600> comes<00:02:03.810> up<00:02:04.079> bringing<00:02:04.469> the

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
big flow and so it comes up bringing the

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.219 
big flow and so it comes up bringing the
warm<00:02:04.890> air<00:02:05.130> upwards<00:02:05.840> there<00:02:06.840> are<00:02:06.960> three

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
warm air upwards there are three

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.469 
warm air upwards there are three
different<00:02:07.439> methods<00:02:07.710> that<00:02:08.220> we<00:02:08.640> carry<00:02:09.239> in<00:02:09.360> that

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
different methods that we carry in that

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.990 
different methods that we carry in that
we<00:02:10.020> recommend<00:02:10.500> most<00:02:10.860> often<00:02:11.310> is<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.610> sling

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
we recommend most often is the sling

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.730 
we recommend most often is the sling
method<00:02:12.420> is<00:02:12.540> what

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
method is what

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.920 
method is what
I call<00:02:13.040> and<00:02:13.280> that's<00:02:13.790> what<00:02:14.030> you<00:02:14.180> saw<00:02:14.420> me<00:02:14.570> do<00:02:14.720> on

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
I call and that's what you saw me do on

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.470 
I call and that's what you saw me do on
the<00:02:15.050> dock<00:02:15.260> there<00:02:15.530> where<00:02:16.100> you've<00:02:16.220> got<00:02:16.430> this<00:02:17.180> far

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
the dock there where you've got this far

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.860 
the dock there where you've got this far
left<00:02:17.780> picture<00:02:18.170> where<00:02:18.440> you<00:02:18.560> get<00:02:18.800> two<00:02:19.100> ropes<00:02:19.870> you

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
left picture where you get two ropes you

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.080 
left picture where you get two ropes you
know<00:02:20.900> being<00:02:21.170> supported<00:02:21.740> across<00:02:21.980> from<00:02:22.550> two

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
know being supported across from two

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.210 
know being supported across from two
piers<00:02:23.450> or<00:02:23.690> two<00:02:23.900> docks<00:02:24.140> or<00:02:24.440> slip<00:02:24.890> or<00:02:25.010> whatever

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
piers or two docks or slip or whatever

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.520 
piers or two docks or slip or whatever
the<00:02:25.340> case<00:02:25.490> might<00:02:25.730> be<00:02:25.790> and<00:02:26.180> then<00:02:26.870> the<00:02:27.080> second

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
the case might be and then the second

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.440 
the case might be and then the second
option<00:02:27.740> is<00:02:28.070> to<00:02:28.130> be<00:02:28.310> able<00:02:28.460> to<00:02:28.730> do<00:02:28.820> a<00:02:28.850> doc<00:02:29.180> mount

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
option is to be able to do a doc mount

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.300 
option is to be able to do a doc mount
now<00:02:29.600> the<00:02:29.660> document<00:02:30.140> can<00:02:30.290> be<00:02:30.320> going<00:02:30.710> down<00:02:30.950> much

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
now the document can be going down much

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.550 
now the document can be going down much
lower<00:02:31.610> and<00:02:31.970> then<00:02:32.120> pointed<00:02:32.480> upwards<00:02:32.810> in<00:02:33.050> this

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
lower and then pointed upwards in this

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.530 
lower and then pointed upwards in this
case<00:02:33.770> I'm<00:02:34.310> just<00:02:34.490> showing<00:02:34.670> it<00:02:34.880> to<00:02:35.060> flow<00:02:35.360> across

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
case I'm just showing it to flow across

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.100 
case I'm just showing it to flow across
and<00:02:36.140> then<00:02:37.070> the<00:02:37.550> third<00:02:37.760> option<00:02:38.060> would<00:02:38.870> be<00:02:38.930> a

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
and then the third option would be a

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.860 
and then the third option would be a
float<00:02:39.560> method<00:02:40.010> and<00:02:40.220> with<00:02:41.090> the<00:02:41.240> float<00:02:41.480> method

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
float method and with the float method

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.050 
float method and with the float method
you<00:02:42.050> don't<00:02:42.350> aren't<00:02:42.890> down<00:02:43.190> deep<00:02:43.520> enough<00:02:43.850> to

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
you don't aren't down deep enough to

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.180 
you don't aren't down deep enough to
bring<00:02:44.270> up<00:02:44.450> warm<00:02:44.810> water<00:02:45.140> but<00:02:45.800> you<00:02:45.830> certainly

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
bring up warm water but you certainly

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.790 
bring up warm water but you certainly
can<00:02:46.640> create<00:02:47.000> water<00:02:47.420> flow<00:02:47.900> so<00:02:48.290> this<00:02:48.560> would<00:02:48.770> be

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
can create water flow so this would be

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.460 
can create water flow so this would be
just<00:02:49.160> you<00:02:49.970> know<00:02:50.090> really<00:02:50.330> in<00:02:50.720> my<00:02:50.990> opinion<00:02:51.020> the

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
just you know really in my opinion the

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.220 
just you know really in my opinion the
third<00:02:52.010> best<00:02:52.370> option<00:02:52.970> would<00:02:53.510> be<00:02:53.570> to<00:02:53.750> set<00:02:54.050> it<00:02:54.170> up

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
third best option would be to set it up

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.380 
third best option would be to set it up
on<00:02:54.350> a<00:02:54.410> float<00:02:54.710> now<00:02:55.460> another<00:02:55.670> thing<00:02:55.790> that<00:02:56.120> people

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
on a float now another thing that people

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.090 
on a float now another thing that people
do<00:02:56.600> is<00:02:56.780> they<00:02:56.930> will<00:02:57.050> actually<00:02:57.440> mount<00:02:57.680> this<00:02:57.830> down

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
do is they will actually mount this down

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.130 
do is they will actually mount this down
at<00:02:58.430> the<00:02:58.670> bottom<00:02:58.880> where<00:02:59.420> it's<00:02:59.570> that<00:02:59.810> Lake<00:03:00.110> is

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
at the bottom where it's that Lake is

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.020 
at the bottom where it's that Lake is
not<00:03:00.470> going<00:03:00.590> to<00:03:00.650> freeze<00:03:00.950> and<00:03:01.250> they'll<00:03:01.730> simply

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
not going to freeze and they'll simply

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.440 
not going to freeze and they'll simply
turn<00:03:02.450> it<00:03:02.600> on<00:03:02.750> only<00:03:03.740> in<00:03:04.010> the<00:03:04.460> spring<00:03:04.850> at<00:03:05.150> when

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
turn it on only in the spring at when

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.810 
turn it on only in the spring at when
the<00:03:05.540> ice<00:03:05.690> might<00:03:06.050> start<00:03:06.410> to<00:03:06.560> move<00:03:06.770> and<00:03:07.100> they<00:03:07.430> let

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
the ice might start to move and they let

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.460 
the ice might start to move and they let
it<00:03:07.940> freeze<00:03:08.330> in<00:03:08.540> the<00:03:08.720> winter<00:03:08.750> time<00:03:09.080> and<00:03:09.140> then

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
it freeze in the winter time and then

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.950 
it freeze in the winter time and then
just<00:03:09.710> turn<00:03:09.860> it<00:03:10.040> on<00:03:10.160> just<00:03:10.430> only<00:03:11.000> at<00:03:11.390> that<00:03:11.660> point

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:11.960 
just turn it on just only at that point

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.170 
just turn it on just only at that point
that's<00:03:12.770> a<00:03:12.920> great<00:03:13.130> option<00:03:13.310> because<00:03:13.550> you<00:03:14.030> don't

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
that's a great option because you don't

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.940 
that's a great option because you don't
have<00:03:14.240> to<00:03:14.360> run<00:03:14.600> the<00:03:14.630> power<00:03:14.960> throughout<00:03:15.860> the

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
have to run the power throughout the

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.730 
have to run the power throughout the
coldest<00:03:16.730> months<00:03:17.060> of<00:03:17.180> the<00:03:17.240> winter<00:03:17.540> now<00:03:18.260> one<00:03:18.710> of

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:18.740 
coldest months of the winter now one of

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.560 
coldest months of the winter now one of
the<00:03:18.860> other<00:03:18.920> options<00:03:19.520> is<00:03:19.700> in<00:03:19.850> a<00:03:19.940> case<00:03:20.150> like<00:03:20.270> this

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:20.570 
the other options is in a case like this

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.330 
the other options is in a case like this
you<00:03:20.810> don't<00:03:21.290> want<00:03:21.560> to<00:03:21.650> have<00:03:21.770> to<00:03:21.890> use<00:03:22.040> power

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
you don't want to have to use power

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.030 
you don't want to have to use power
throughout<00:03:22.820> this<00:03:23.030> whole<00:03:23.330> season<00:03:23.840> so<00:03:24.590> we<00:03:24.740> carry

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
throughout this whole season so we carry

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.830 
throughout this whole season so we carry
a<00:03:25.130> thermostat<00:03:25.820> that<00:03:25.850> will<00:03:26.180> actually<00:03:26.360> turn<00:03:26.690> it

on at a certain point of temperature so
you<00:03:29.600> might<00:03:29.780> set<00:03:30.020> it<00:03:30.170> at<00:03:30.290> 28<00:03:30.830> degrees<00:03:30.860> so<00:03:31.430> every

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
you might set it at 28 degrees so every

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.820 
you might set it at 28 degrees so every
time<00:03:31.790> it<00:03:31.910> reaches<00:03:32.240> 28<00:03:32.630> degrees<00:03:32.960> it<00:03:33.230> will<00:03:33.530> turn

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
time it reaches 28 degrees it will turn

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.310 
time it reaches 28 degrees it will turn
on<00:03:33.980> it's<00:03:34.220> a<00:03:34.340> very<00:03:34.580> inexpensive<00:03:35.390> way<00:03:35.900> to<00:03:35.930> do<00:03:36.170> it
