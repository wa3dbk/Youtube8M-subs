00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:37.609
Hello! Welcome to Guitarspot.gr. I'm Irene
Ketikidi and today I'll be showing you how

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:44.140
to play a small section from my song Yelling
Gestures of my new record Martial Arts and Magic Tricks.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:51.140
We are in E dorian on the 4th position.

00:00:53.469 --> 00:01:00.169
We'll also be using some notes from the 3rd position. First we slide to the 9th fret on the G string. We also use some vibrato.

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:12.539
Then we have a half note bend on the 6th fret of the same string.

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:23.759
Then we go to the 3rd position and we use a chromatic run on the 5th, 6th and 7th frets of the A string with palm muting.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:33.560
Then we go to the 5th and 7th frets of the D string.

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:51.039
Then we have another bend together with a steady note on the B and high E strings.

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:03.390
After that we go to the 8th fret of the B string and then exit on the 9th fret of the G string. One more time slowly.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:21.069
This is the first part of the solo. Let's play it on more time from the top.

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:25.169

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:32.370
Nice! We continue almost the same way. We
first have a bend on the 9th fret of the G string.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:41.010
To be exact it's two bends both on
the 9th and 7th frets.

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:49.910
Next we are going touse sweep picking, tapping and legato. So
let's take it step by step.

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:59.910
We are still on the 4th position for the left hand where we
have a three note sweep.

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:10.899
We'll use the 7th fret of the G string, the 8th fret of the B string, the 7th fret of the high E string and then we'll hammer on the 10th fret of the same string.

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:22.740
We then have to quickly tap on the 15th fret of the high E string.

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:32.420
Next we have a descending line using legato and tapping technique.

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:43.450
We are going to use three notes per string.

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:50.850
So the pattern using also notes from the 3rd position goes like this.

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:04.940
We will be playing this pattern but descending and with some repeating notes.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:17.040
The notes we'll be hitting using the middle finger of the right hand are on the 15th fret of the high E string, same fret of the B string and finally on the14th fret of the G string.

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:25.460
Let's play the first three strings.

00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:31.860
The rest is using only
legato technique.

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:45.160
We finish the lick using a harmonic tap. This means that we are going to tap 12 frets higher than the note we are already playing on the 4th fret of the A string.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.960
Tap on the 16th fret of the A string slowly. It's important to tap exactly above the iron fret and not in between. Let's play the whole lick

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:08.580
One more time.

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:27.310
Let's try playing the whole thing again first slowly and then up to speed.

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:08.170
