 wall only in social networks 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.660
 in the tops of the video where you dance with Dmitry 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.350
 and people 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.350
 as 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.140
 services

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.950

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.230

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.980

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:27.370

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:29.350
 simplified as far as i remember originated on 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.970
 This is apparently some kind of montage. 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.920
 someone kidding from guys did 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.890

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.880

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.670
 what video do you say to him often 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.630
 on some holidays where many, many 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.840
 dignitaries , including 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:05.729
 the president and I don't know which fragment you are 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.729

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:13.800
 I danced with different presidents of different 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.750
 countries and what president do you have 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:20.640
 Dmitry Anatolyevich Medvedev Well, I 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.640
 imagine what could be a fragment 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:27.280
 it if you burn and about american boy 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.320

 Law Faculty of Leningrad 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.269
 State University 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.820
 but it was a long time ago it was not in it 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:39.030
 year this is a very old shooting visibility and 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.920
 I don't know why she just appeared 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.920
 there is not only I dance there a lot 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:48.330
 people dancing was performed and Alena 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:52.420
 apina and if i 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.010
 I'm not mistaken yet glyzin spoke Alexei 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.099
 glyzin 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:59.470
 yes, well, it was a long time ago I did not understand 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:03.040
 because of what the hype but apparently only 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:05.910
 now it appeared these all just well and 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.050
 what would you rate 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.830
 choreographic abilities bear and in 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:13.350
 which ear 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:15.990
 listen i honestly don't understand about 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:21.770
 what are you talking about see what's behind 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:21.770
 fragment of the well does not appreciate how I have 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.220
 I just once took us by surprise 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:31.860
 That plan I do not understand what is at stake 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.350
 specific well that is where you are Anton 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:41.430
 what is the judge there but probably 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:43.850
 good dance no, unfortunately very 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.850
 seldom
