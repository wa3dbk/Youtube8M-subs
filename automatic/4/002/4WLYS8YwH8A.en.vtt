00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
about this hair when I received the hair

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.059 
about this hair when I received the hair
you<00:02:35.599> know<00:02:35.719> I<00:02:35.750> told<00:02:36.079> you<00:02:36.230> guys<00:02:36.349> that<00:02:36.409> it<00:02:36.739> was<00:02:36.829> all

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
you know I told you guys that it was all

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:39.789 
you know I told you guys that it was all
16<00:02:37.549> inches<00:02:38.030> but<00:02:38.689> like<00:02:39.019> when<00:02:39.200> I<00:02:39.230> watched<00:02:39.620> the

00:02:39.789 --> 00:02:39.799 
16 inches but like when I watched the

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:42.819 
16 inches but like when I watched the
closure<00:02:40.329> it<00:02:41.329> like<00:02:41.569> stretched<00:02:41.989> more<00:02:42.409> I<00:02:42.439> guess

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:42.829 
closure it like stretched more I guess

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:44.619 
closure it like stretched more I guess
like<00:02:43.099> I<00:02:43.250> don't<00:02:43.430> know<00:02:43.579> but<00:02:44.120> when<00:02:44.329> I<00:02:44.359> had

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:44.629 
like I don't know but when I had

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:46.690 
like I don't know but when I had
installed<00:02:45.379> it<00:02:45.680> I<00:02:45.829> had<00:02:46.010> to<00:02:46.129> cut<00:02:46.340> the<00:02:46.459> clothes

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
installed it I had to cut the clothes

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.459 
installed it I had to cut the clothes
you're<00:02:46.969> a<00:02:47.000> lot<00:02:47.269> like<00:02:47.719> to<00:02:48.709> a<00:02:49.450> machine<00:02:50.450> like<00:02:51.079> this

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:51.469 
you're a lot like to a machine like this

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:55.240 
you're a lot like to a machine like this
like<00:02:52.010> I<00:02:52.340> had<00:02:52.700> to<00:02:52.819> cut<00:02:53.000> the<00:02:53.030> closure<00:02:53.450> to<00:02:54.409> match

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
like I had to cut the closure to match

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.569 
like I had to cut the closure to match
the<00:02:55.730> hair<00:02:56.030> so<00:02:56.569> I<00:02:56.870> really<00:02:57.620> cut<00:02:57.920> nothing<00:02:58.370> else

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:58.579 
the hair so I really cut nothing else

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:00.459 
the hair so I really cut nothing else
like<00:02:58.969> you<00:02:59.239> see<00:02:59.420> I<00:02:59.450> still<00:02:59.750> have<00:02:59.810> like<00:03:00.170> long

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:00.469 
like you see I still have like long

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:03.069 
like you see I still have like long
pieces<00:03:00.829> at<00:03:01.099> the<00:03:01.219> bottom<00:03:01.250> or<00:03:01.730> whatever<00:03:02.120> but<00:03:02.810> I

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:03.079 
pieces at the bottom or whatever but I

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:05.020 
pieces at the bottom or whatever but I
did<00:03:03.349> have<00:03:03.530> to<00:03:03.560> cut<00:03:03.889> the<00:03:04.010> closure<00:03:04.340> because<00:03:04.669> the

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
did have to cut the closure because the

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.449 
did have to cut the closure because the
closure<00:03:05.299> since<00:03:06.200> 16<00:03:06.650> inches<00:03:06.919> but<00:03:07.099> it's<00:03:07.280> like

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
closure since 16 inches but it's like

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.429 
closure since 16 inches but it's like
longer<00:03:07.939> than<00:03:08.060> 16<00:03:08.450> inches<00:03:08.750> so<00:03:08.930> I<00:03:09.109> guess<00:03:09.290> you

00:03:09.429 --> 00:03:09.439 
longer than 16 inches so I guess you

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:11.589 
longer than 16 inches so I guess you
like<00:03:09.620> stretched<00:03:10.129> out<00:03:10.340> a<00:03:10.370> little<00:03:10.549> bit<00:03:10.790> I<00:03:11.060> don't

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:11.599 
like stretched out a little bit I don't

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:14.979 
like stretched out a little bit I don't
know<00:03:12.099> but<00:03:13.099> yeah<00:03:13.730> the<00:03:13.939> closure<00:03:14.180> was<00:03:14.480> a<00:03:14.750> little

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
know but yeah the closure was a little

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:18.670 
know but yeah the closure was a little
longer<00:03:15.200> and<00:03:15.620> the<00:03:16.310> closure<00:03:17.180> wave<00:03:17.689> pattern<00:03:18.319> is

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
longer and the closure wave pattern is

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.390 
longer and the closure wave pattern is
just<00:03:19.129> a<00:03:19.370> little<00:03:20.359> different<00:03:20.989> than<00:03:21.200> the<00:03:22.040> rest<00:03:22.219> of

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
just a little different than the rest of

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.890 
just a little different than the rest of
the<00:03:22.489> bundles<00:03:22.909> like<00:03:23.030> you<00:03:23.269> really<00:03:23.569> can't<00:03:23.810> even

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
the bundles like you really can't even

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.580 
the bundles like you really can't even
notice<00:03:24.469> it<00:03:24.709> but<00:03:25.209> like<00:03:26.209> I<00:03:26.629> can<00:03:26.900> try<00:03:27.169> to<00:03:27.200> show<00:03:27.530> you

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.699 
notice it but like I can try to show you
guys<00:03:27.889> but<00:03:28.849> it's<00:03:29.540> just<00:03:29.870> a<00:03:29.959> little<00:03:30.139> different<00:03:30.379> I

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
guys but it's just a little different I

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:31.959 
guys but it's just a little different I
don't<00:03:30.950> know<00:03:31.069> it's<00:03:31.219> because<00:03:31.310> it<00:03:31.639> was<00:03:31.760> like<00:03:31.909> a

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:31.969 
don't know it's because it was like a

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:34.179 
don't know it's because it was like a
