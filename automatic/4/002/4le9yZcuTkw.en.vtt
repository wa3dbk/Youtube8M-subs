00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.090
 the gentlemen have just returned from wedge 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.920
 therefore I say from some or from Milan how 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.860
 announced I made my trip 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.750
 annual to the games week to see a little 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:21.869
 how it turns the site or change for the 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:24.990
 local some time in all 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.779
 even diagonal directions with gracefulness 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.099
 with affection but in the end the 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:34.620
 prediction or that feeling one is 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:36.600
 verified with intensity and true that 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.200
 certain experiences go to invalidate the 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.750
 your perception of things but to me of 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.399
 that is, a fair like this does not tell me 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.789
 absolutely nothing 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:51.840
 that is, I do n't care about trying 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:53.760
 with leo duty destiny to try 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.210
 assassin's creed ii united that there is between a 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:01.609
 month no therefore practically points a 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:04.650
 disadvantage are total including pasta 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:06.689
 del del ciao as cabbage is called that 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.590
 you really can't sell at 7 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.360
 euro and 50 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.060
 the peace that then made it to rule 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.330
 art with all the trappings and typical 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.759
 the pasta with pesto beans the 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.430
 ok, but cabbage 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.740
 we must also facilitate youth 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.830
 eventual that comes there and then gets caught 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.590
 of the figures there is a panic point a 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:33.720
 please instead we can list them 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:38.159
 right on one hand the first 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.340
 surely the Japanese come very well 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.509
 very well 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.509
 well 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:44.509
 anything 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.550
 such as 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.000
 this 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.100
 but seeing Japanese was and was 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:03.610
 a borebeary thing they came here to 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.870
 show their presence to sign a 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.410
 bit of stuff 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:10.390
 another plus point is definitely the 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:14.170
 serena air ob 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:17.620
 so we perceived they know how to play 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:20.440
 on the web they are attracting and accumulating 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.260
 in the data then tweaking of this 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.250
 intrinsic and therefore excellent 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.250
 interaction of that type 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.740
 well 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.740
 video 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.580
 Hello 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.580
 just got it 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.170
 ok 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.170
 hello parts 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:59.000
 oliviero made republic 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.650
 favor point obviously the gnocca not 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.810
 may be missing even if the 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.810
 gnocca in a single copy 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:20.820
 great celebrities have been missing for 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:24.060
 way of saying but a specimen 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:26.210
 enough for everyone else 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.790
 gentlemen obviously the games in that 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:33.570
 those were the only thing from the point 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:36.390
 from a locative view we call it thus 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:38.970
 much more serenity in the spaces a 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:43.170
 a little bit more isolated less casino games 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:45.390
 that maybe on ios on ipad strusi here 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.820
 but the games that are worth 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:51.770
 try vojodina takes very well 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.770
 well very well 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:01.530
 and then I also had a great thing about 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.450
 collapse to send to hurt a little bit 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:07.020
 people and that too is definitely a 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:11.160
 point to nothing else is enough from 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:14.210
 say or panic headache and fear in 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.770
 practically an hour in and out 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:19.230
 thank goodness I live near that 

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:22.950
 little train does not take so much because if not 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:28.230
 this had collapsed somewhere 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:31.350
 see you for the next excursions 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:33.780
 ah yes tomorrow we go to see a little bit 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:37.980
 of wait tomorrow we go to see a 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:41.940
 little bit of Paralympic ascent of the 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:47.240
 things a little bit out of the ordinary no e 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:47.240
 therefore deserves a testimony greetings 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.780
 Yup 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.750
 in conclusion
