00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
anything from j.crew this many reason is

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.480 
anything from j.crew this many reason is
because<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.930> nap<00:00:25.109> outlets<00:00:25.529> obviously<00:00:26.010> is<00:00:26.189> an

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
because the nap outlets obviously is an

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.800 
because the nap outlets obviously is an
outlet<00:00:26.880> price<00:00:27.180> so<00:00:27.359> it's<00:00:27.480> a<00:00:27.570> little<00:00:27.689> bit

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
outlet price so it's a little bit

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.470 
outlet price so it's a little bit
cheaper<00:00:28.289> than<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.160> regular<00:00:29.340> store<00:00:29.820> of<00:00:30.060> j.crew

regular<00:04:18.390> pants<00:04:18.979> but<00:04:19.979> because<00:04:20.190> I'm<00:04:20.340> 56<00:04:20.789> they're

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
regular pants but because I'm 56 they're

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.590 
regular pants but because I'm 56 they're
little

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
little

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.330 
little
it<00:04:21.690> kind<00:04:22.080> of<00:04:22.140> short<00:04:22.410> to<00:04:22.560> like<00:04:22.710> really<00:04:22.950> short
