concept you know like do a playthrough
of<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.309> map<00:00:44.899> maybe<00:00:45.899> still<00:00:46.230> do<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.440> live<00:00:46.590> comms

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
of a map maybe still do the live comms

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.470 
of a map maybe still do the live comms
or<00:00:47.070> maybe<00:00:47.190> do<00:00:47.370> away<00:00:47.579> with<00:00:47.610> live<00:00:47.910> commentary<00:00:48.149> is

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
reviews of the maps talk about some of

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:56.720 
reviews of the maps talk about some of
the<00:00:55.320> features<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.710> it<00:00:55.980> has<00:00:56.010> some<00:00:56.399> of<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.520> new

how fun it is you know if it's a

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.030 
how fun it is you know if it's a

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
difficult map all that good stuff and I

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.899 
difficult map all that good stuff and I

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
thought that it'd be something that

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.270 
thought that it'd be something that
would<00:01:06.060> be<00:01:06.180> kind<00:01:06.450> of<00:01:06.560> fun<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.590> watch<00:01:07.830> it's
