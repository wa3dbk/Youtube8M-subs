00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
my thought might as well open it while I

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.930 
my thought might as well open it while I
wait<00:00:45.820> for<00:00:45.850> things<00:00:46.239> to<00:00:46.390> arrive<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:48.070> you<00:00:48.640> know

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
for things that you for things to

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.569 
for things that you for things to
actually<00:00:50.440> open<00:00:51.239> I<00:00:53.160> don't<00:00:54.160> think<00:00:54.219> that<00:00:54.430> made

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:54.579 
actually open I don't think that made

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:57.150

waiting for things to arrive so i

00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:59.939
