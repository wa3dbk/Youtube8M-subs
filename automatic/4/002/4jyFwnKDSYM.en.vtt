all<00:00:01.500> right<00:00:01.800> back<00:00:02.190> again<00:00:02.370> today<00:00:02.850> we<00:00:02.970> get<00:00:03.060> out

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
all right back again today we get out

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:04.849 
all right back again today we get out
the<00:00:03.300> old<00:00:03.419> Famicom<00:00:03.990> and<00:00:04.230> I<00:00:04.500> figured<00:00:04.770> we<00:00:04.830> could

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
the old Famicom and I figured we could

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.270 
the old Famicom and I figured we could
put<00:00:05.100> in<00:00:05.190> this<00:00:05.339> game<00:00:05.580> here<00:00:06.109> Double<00:00:07.109> Dragon<00:00:07.200> 3<00:00:07.620> so

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
put in this game here Double Dragon 3 so

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:16.540 
put in this game here Double Dragon 3 so
pop<00:00:08.639> that<00:00:08.670> in<00:00:08.970> and<00:00:09.000> play<00:00:09.210> some<00:00:09.389> of<00:00:09.480> that<00:00:09.570> I

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:16.550 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.640 

already<00:00:17.550> put<00:00:17.820> up<00:00:17.850> this<00:00:18.090> this<00:00:19.050> version<00:00:19.260> here

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
already put up this this version here

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.550 
already put up this this version here
from<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:19.980> arcade<00:00:20.369> a<00:00:21.270> little<00:00:21.840> bit<00:00:21.990> but<00:00:22.529> I

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
from the arcade a little bit but I

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.040 
from the arcade a little bit but I
figure<00:00:22.800> than<00:00:22.920> we<00:00:23.010> put<00:00:23.189> in<00:00:23.600> the<00:00:24.600> Rosetta<00:00:24.960> Stone

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
figure than we put in the Rosetta Stone

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.000 
figure than we put in the Rosetta Stone
here<00:00:25.529> for<00:00:25.880> the<00:00:26.880> Famicom<00:00:27.599> but<00:00:28.410> you<00:00:28.560> see<00:00:28.769> some<00:00:28.980> of

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
here for the Famicom but you see some of

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.530 
here for the Famicom but you see some of
the<00:00:29.130> differences<00:00:29.429> between<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:30.060> two<00:00:32.300> this<00:00:33.300> one

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
the differences between the two this one

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.830 
the differences between the two this one
is<00:00:33.719> so<00:00:34.200> much<00:00:34.469> closely<00:00:35.160> like<00:00:36.120> more<00:00:36.450> closely

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
is so much closely like more closely

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.229 
is so much closely like more closely
related<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.829> first<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.700> second<00:00:39.030> one<00:00:39.090> as

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
related to the first and second one as

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:46.200 
related to the first and second one as
far<00:00:39.420> as<00:00:39.540> graphics<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.520> gameplay<00:00:41.520> wise

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.930 

different<00:00:46.990> patterns<00:00:47.980> since<00:00:48.250> we<00:00:48.430> only<00:00:48.610> got<00:00:48.790> one

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
different patterns since we only got one

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.420 
different patterns since we only got one
player<00:00:49.180> will<00:00:49.390> do<00:00:49.480> one<00:00:49.690> player<00:00:49.960> it's<00:00:50.890> a<00:00:51.100> bit

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:51.430 
player will do one player it's a bit

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.160 
player will do one player it's a bit
more<00:00:51.550> challenging<00:00:51.610> for<00:00:52.180> this<00:00:52.450> game<00:00:52.660> for<00:00:52.960> sure

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
more challenging for this game for sure

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.430 
more challenging for this game for sure
because<00:00:53.470> you<00:00:54.010> know<00:00:54.180> basically<00:00:55.180> maybe<00:00:56.170> get

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
because you know basically maybe get

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.130 
because you know basically maybe get
smoked<00:00:56.830> in<00:00:57.130> the<00:00:57.250> first<00:00:57.489> part<00:00:57.790> you<00:00:58.120> know<00:00:58.360> that's

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
smoked in the first part you know that's

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.860 
smoked in the first part you know that's
it<00:00:59.350> it's<00:00:59.620> game<00:00:59.800> over<00:01:00.239> so<00:01:01.239> you<00:01:01.360> really<00:01:01.630> got<00:01:01.780> to

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
it it's game over so you really got to

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.770 
it it's game over so you really got to
play<00:01:02.080> and<00:01:02.739> wisely

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
play and wisely

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.140 
play and wisely
start<00:01:04.780> off<00:01:04.930> with<00:01:05.229> just<00:01:06.190> your<00:01:06.280> basic<00:01:06.550> bare

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.150 
start off with just your basic bare

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:14.940 
start off with just your basic bare
hands<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:12.729> your<00:01:13.450> power<00:01:13.840> meters<00:01:14.200> over<00:01:14.650> in<00:01:14.770> the

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
hands and your power meters over in the

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.300 
hands and your power meters over in the
left<00:01:15.670> corner<00:01:15.910> a<00:01:16.410> little<00:01:17.410> bit<00:01:17.560> different<00:01:18.070> you

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
left corner a little bit different you

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.820 
left corner a little bit different you
know<00:01:18.490> as<00:01:18.729> far<00:01:18.880> as<00:01:18.940> luck<00:01:19.240> goes<00:01:19.509> compared<00:01:20.380> to<00:01:20.530> the

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
know as far as luck goes compared to the

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.170 
know as far as luck goes compared to the
first<00:01:21.070> two<00:01:21.280> but<00:01:21.960> with<00:01:22.960> the<00:01:23.670> power<00:01:24.670> meter<00:01:24.940> and

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
first two but with the power meter and

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.980 
first two but with the power meter and
things<00:01:25.390> like<00:01:25.509> that<00:01:25.780> but<00:01:27.180> yeah<00:01:28.180> there's<00:01:28.540> a<00:01:28.600> huge

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
things like that but yeah there's a huge

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.350 
things like that but yeah there's a huge
difference<00:01:29.290> with<00:01:29.770> the<00:01:29.920> way<00:01:30.040> it<00:01:30.160> looks<00:01:30.460> between

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
difference with the way it looks between

00:01:31.360 --> 00:02:00.220 
difference with the way it looks between
the

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:00.230 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:05.120 

the<00:02:01.230> music's<00:02:01.620> really<00:02:01.770> cool<00:02:03.020> it's<00:02:04.020> like<00:02:04.200> when

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
the music's really cool it's like when

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.470 
the music's really cool it's like when
you<00:02:05.220> take<00:02:05.400> a<00:02:05.460> look<00:02:05.610> at<00:02:05.730> this<00:02:05.850> one<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.090> take<00:02:06.450> a

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:06.480 
you take a look at this one you take a

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.900 
you take a look at this one you take a
look<00:02:06.660> at<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.810> arcade<00:02:07.170> you're<00:02:08.070> just<00:02:08.250> like<00:02:08.429> what

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
look at the arcade you're just like what

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:43.870 
look at the arcade you're just like what
went<00:02:09.690> wrong

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.100 

as<00:02:44.880> you<00:02:45.060> can<00:02:45.180> see<00:02:45.360> I'm<00:02:45.480> getting<00:02:45.660> hurt<00:02:45.930> pretty

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
as you can see I'm getting hurt pretty

00:02:46.110 --> 00:03:06.210 
as you can see I'm getting hurt pretty
bad<00:02:46.380> here

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.450 

this<00:03:06.700> one<00:03:06.880> is<00:03:07.000> quite<00:03:07.240> challenging<00:03:08.310> seeing<00:03:09.310> the

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:09.460 
this one is quite challenging seeing the

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.560 
this one is quite challenging seeing the
fact<00:03:09.700> that<00:03:09.970> if<00:03:10.240> you<00:03:10.510> do<00:03:10.800> you<00:03:11.800> know<00:03:12.480> wind<00:03:13.480> up

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
fact that if you do you know wind up

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.870 
fact that if you do you know wind up
losing<00:03:13.810> all<00:03:14.290> of<00:03:14.320> your<00:03:14.590> life<00:03:14.770> it's<00:03:15.400> game<00:03:15.670> over

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
losing all of your life it's game over

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.640 
losing all of your life it's game over
you<00:03:16.360> know<00:03:16.480> there's<00:03:16.780> nothing<00:03:16.990> else<00:03:17.260> that<00:03:17.440> you

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
you know there's nothing else that you

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.680 
you know there's nothing else that you
know<00:03:17.770> start<00:03:18.730> off<00:03:18.850> with<00:03:19.060> your<00:03:19.180> second<00:03:19.540> guide

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
know start off with your second guide

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.260 
know start off with your second guide
here<00:03:20.110> where<00:03:20.320> you<00:03:20.410> left<00:03:20.440> off<00:03:20.860> you<00:03:21.220> just<00:03:21.400> dead

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.270 
here where you left off you just dead

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:44.039 
here where you left off you just dead
that's<00:03:23.050> it

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:46.899 

as<00:03:45.049> you're<00:03:45.290> probably<00:03:45.500> going<00:03:46.250> to<00:03:46.400> see<00:03:46.610> her<00:03:46.730> in

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:46.909 
as you're probably going to see her in

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:59.530 
as you're probably going to see her in
here<00:03:47.860> sure<00:03:48.860> this<00:03:49.069> is<00:03:49.220> gonna<00:03:49.370> be

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:05.420 

see<00:04:00.540> me<00:04:00.660> lasting<00:04:01.020> much<00:04:01.200> longer<00:04:03.920> and<00:04:04.920> that'd<00:04:05.280> be

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
see me lasting much longer and that'd be

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.840 
see me lasting much longer and that'd be
the<00:04:05.550> end<00:04:05.580> of<00:04:05.820> it

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
the end of it

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:13.580 
the end of it
check<00:04:08.850> that<00:04:09.030> out<00:04:09.500> so<00:04:11.450> as<00:04:12.450> you<00:04:13.410> can<00:04:13.530> see

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
check that out so as you can see

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.980 
check that out so as you can see
starting<00:04:14.160> back<00:04:14.340> at<00:04:14.370> the<00:04:14.610> beginning<00:04:14.730> so<00:04:15.240> you

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:15.990 
starting back at the beginning so you

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.620 
starting back at the beginning so you
know<00:04:16.140> it's<00:04:16.860> a<00:04:16.980> lot<00:04:17.190> more<00:04:17.459> difficult<00:04:17.820> because

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
know it's a lot more difficult because

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.039 
know it's a lot more difficult because
there<00:04:19.140> is<00:04:19.260> no<00:04:19.440> continues<00:04:19.980> in<00:04:20.190> it

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
there is no continues in it

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.420 
there is no continues in it
if<00:04:22.049> you<00:04:22.200> get<00:04:22.350> smoked<00:04:22.650> like<00:04:22.830> that<00:04:23.040> it's

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
if you get smoked like that it's

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.580 
if you get smoked like that it's
basically<00:04:24.420> game<00:04:24.660> over<00:04:24.990> you<00:04:25.140> know<00:04:25.230> I<00:04:25.290> have<00:04:25.440> to

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
basically game over you know I have to

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.220 
basically game over you know I have to
start<00:04:25.800> from<00:04:25.860> the<00:04:26.010> beginning<00:04:26.750> obviously<00:04:27.750> if

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
start from the beginning obviously if

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:29.390 
start from the beginning obviously if
you're<00:04:28.380> playing<00:04:28.560> with<00:04:28.710> two<00:04:28.830> players<00:04:29.100> to<00:04:29.250> be<00:04:29.370> a

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
you're playing with two players to be a

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.450 
you're playing with two players to be a
little<00:04:29.640> bit<00:04:29.730> easier<00:04:30.060> but<00:04:30.440> yeah<00:04:31.440> it's<00:04:32.160> pretty

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
little bit easier but yeah it's pretty

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.240 
little bit easier but yeah it's pretty

bit of what some dragon three the

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:39.200 
bit of what some dragon three the
Rosetta<00:04:37.530> Stone<00:04:37.620> look<00:04:37.980> like<00:04:38.160> for<00:04:38.460> the<00:04:38.610> Famicom

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
Rosetta Stone look like for the Famicom

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:40.970 
Rosetta Stone look like for the Famicom
and<00:04:39.240> like<00:04:39.810> always<00:04:40.140> open<00:04:40.500> up<00:04:40.530> another<00:04:40.770> video
