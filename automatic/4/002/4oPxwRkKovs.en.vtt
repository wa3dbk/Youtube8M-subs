00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.430
 in the field the nativity professionals how many people in senés the technique 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:06.300
 alexander in our country 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:12.119
 in this one you are few teachers because there would be schools until very recently 

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:13.359
 they close 

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:16.359
 at the moment we are 60 registered in the association 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.739
 he paid more than he arrives but as we do not know percent 

00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:22.800
 does not use says it is there 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.939
 since almost 60 years ago so much Spain in all Spain 60% is up to 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:32.579
 nothing you have to study the systems on the terrace after years of 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.650
 the match is expected 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.410
 beyond the period of three years 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.440
 Spain up to cd 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.590
 up to five years ago in doñana 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.440
 a little bit more there and a school in Barcelona and others have just been opened to 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.130
 Madrid 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.170
 I know that people who care about Alexander can 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.210
 train as a teacher in Spain 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.000
 if you think we're going to see an example of one of your classes we have our 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.540
 companion paula that that afternoon to the student model ceremony of 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.900
 alexander nativity scene technique 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.840
 can not explain to us that the hospital of Mary one of the movements that stir 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.790
 class or some of the facilities provided by this technique very well 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.960
 good pabla that must do the first 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.490
 let's do an example of how to take a weight 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.799
 of at &amp; t you take it 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:19.159
 without thinking about anything 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:21.490
 i will see 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:22.490
 after 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.990
 how can it be improved 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.900
 yuste has been for the weight per hundred 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.930
 from quite far 3 now I am going to recommend that you approach the weight 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.179
 ok for 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:38.880
 to go to catch a but what we have to do is to get closer to the sport 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.300
 the closer the less heavy 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.720
 and the second thing we have to do is 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.049
 from jarque the folds of the body accompany you 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:50.670
 to that place I would have to say that I'm going to ask 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.670
 Leave the neck free so that the head goes forward 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:00.270
 that is to lengthen the back and the knee point forward away from 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.690
 The perfection 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.030
 I went well I will continue to remove the cloths the text this 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.350
 was made of the arts or 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.390
 and now the weight should be answered the words representing 22% 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:17.409
 and much more feasible is not easy we punish - the body plus take the pc 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:21.999
 or to the spectator to citizens this act because there is the ps3 and pc a long time ago 

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:22.830
 you need 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.830
 that every body takes the weight not only the deadlines 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.569
 especially above all talk down the lumbar what makes most of the 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:32.169
 people 

00:02:32.169 --> 00:02:34.949
 when you do not use the knees you are using 

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:38.129
 normal to double and here there is no speculation 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:41.230
 haye we have to take advantage of the possibilities that the body gives us but 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.140
 I think you have 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.349
 another example within what is the technique 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:48.610
 c5n in your report 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.610
 if in this case it's really fun to suddenly it's based 

00:02:53.279 --> 00:02:56.169
 if these people 

00:02:56.169 --> 00:02:57.150
 why you 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.150
 symmetrical 

00:03:01.029 --> 00:03:02.539
 in what you do in nothing 

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:05.539
 feel comfortable 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:08.959
 find your balance 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.949
 they dropped their arms kg 

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:13.399
 iveth up 

00:03:13.399 --> 00:03:16.399
 nothing of this so much the legs 

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:22.180
 well paola right now singh 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.879
 propose it is using the alexander technique 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:28.540
 is leaving free neck to the head going forward upwards 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.690
 the shovels lengthened sauce 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.069
 and the knees this leader that the mind forward 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:37.529
 let's see what happens when we lose one of these directions 

00:03:37.529 --> 00:03:40.529
 pablo ania the head back of transcendent balafia 

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:44.459
 I'm here because I'm going to catch her lame because I know she would fall 

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:48.899
 3 now so this end you lose your balance between them in the head 

00:03:48.899 --> 00:03:49.979
 backward 

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:51.809
 instead of the teaching area 

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:53.669
 with the swords press 

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:55.879
 dy will go to another side 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:57.999
 and the last thing that also 

00:03:57.999 --> 00:04:02.279
 it is very visual the knee will direct me coffee forward as now 

00:04:02.279 --> 00:04:05.279
 basso lock them back 

00:04:06.999 --> 00:04:08.729
 if we lose the balance 

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:11.619
 comes wants that what he paid the afternoon not only to the extent is what 

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:15.449
 we should normally do on the floor that will all exercise in balance 

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.890
 do not 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.230
 they are all well balanced the act and many times without realizing 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.800
 because we do not fall because we are not left to allocate three citations 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.050
 we wanted 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.460
 the Castilian in the back has in the head back leaving the knee 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.499
 it is not clear from this one that he was already losing one of the addresses 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:38.439
 the body co fell 3 when we are in it what we do to not fall is 

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:39.319
 make up for 

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:40.950
 making more strength 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:45.320
 in other parts so you do not fall down you understand what happens is that we do not see it 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.680
 we get used to that strength 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.340
 and somehow the technique of knowing what it gives you is a warm one 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.960
 dynamic that adapts to any situation without compromising 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.389
 your structure 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:02.360
 tutu column the rest of the body scrum very interesting and is what he asks the 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.110
 people who are in the area that I have tried that they really do is very very 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.270
 highly recommended is the translation to class 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.389
 thank you Nativity where we can find you for the people that in the other 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:15.530
 If I do not want to learn the technique, how can they do it? 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:16.340
 in then 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:17.189
 once in a web 

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:19.879
 I think it's the easiest way to find a partner 

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:24.539
 information and the uep is technique alexander point to leave 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:27.689
 with two and a half hours alexander technique so much about this 

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:30.680
 Well, we have a friend here for web address 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:35.659
 we are going to thank you nativity here a very visual master class has explained 

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:40.229
 and very nice thanks to televisa after the bad results and less children 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:44.409
 this channel is worth a good let's see it quickly come let's see the 

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:47.870
 photographs of the children and they had forgotten pink and then recover 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.770
 these images here we have them cd 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.960
 is that I would like you to see why it is not a technique 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.960
 that he used to invent is a technique with which we are born 

00:05:57.749 --> 00:06:01.080
 we lose the backs of the children know a day properly 

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:05.069
 a problem is insinuated without any effort 

00:06:05.069 --> 00:06:09.979
 without thinking how much clarified embrace the children how they embrace using all 

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:12.129
 back without compromising the 

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:13.789
 using the knee 

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:17.379
 It is important that they know it because it is more like a new technique and 

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:20.949
 technical school so that we are not all with which we are born and added already 

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:24.139
 came in well thanks thanks to you now if we pause and go back 

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:24.659
 right away
