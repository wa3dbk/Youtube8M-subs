 show you something different 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.690
 What am I doing in this recipe to give 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.600
 modified so that you do not always 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.640
 the same bank of milk powder 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.960
 I always have four 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:50.440
 light snow 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:53.289
 I will now add the two gems and 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:56.010
 let's beating low impotence just for 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:56.010
 mix the ingredients 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:07.640
 here I have separated 12 women milk 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.410
 skim powder I'll add 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.550
 was also adding a little to 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.600
 little beating 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.600
 along with this mixture 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:25.490
 now let's add three tablespoons of 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.490
 maize 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:45.579
 I'll put two tablespoons of 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:45.579
 coffee of liquid sweetener 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.250
 and I will also add four spoons 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.250
 of wheat flour 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.270
 ae 

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:26.760
 the last ingredient is baking powder 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:33.329
 and if yeast is royal chemical ferment 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:36.799
 White or red tin 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:36.799
 add a woman only 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.989
 and let's mix 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:56.800
 now I'll do more and put half 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.800
 of this mass in the form of silicone 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.670
 I'll let her rest for 15 minutes. 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.670
 and then I'll take it to the oven 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.950
 preheated to 180 degrees for about ten 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.930
 or 15 minutes or so this 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.870
 process you already know 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:19.210
 now that the differential with this 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:24.510
 I have mass left and I will price two 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:24.510
 spoons of cocoa powder other than sugar 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:36.610
 two and a half spoons 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:46.430
 I'll add a little more of 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:53.769
 sweetener because cocoa and so 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:53.769
 sugar top bitter half spoon 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.790
 and another spoonful of wheat bran 

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:21.660
 now with this mass because we're going 

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:23.930
 do the following with the help of a 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.930
 Spoon 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.460
 on such a coconut shell 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:35.470
 silicone 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.470
 I'll put some on the bottom 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:51.990
 and I'll do it now it'll be put 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:53.490
 this cacao cream from the field over 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.410
 this little monkey I put in the 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:58.020
 Bottom I know that in Brazil you do not have to 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:00.090
 sell this cacao cream from the field but 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.280
 you can use that coverage of the 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.690
 chocolate cake I left on the channel 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.460
 the revenue will also leave here in 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:08.190
 low for you to see how it does 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:11.310
 that chocolate coating is giving 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:14.070
 It looks good in the same way and I go 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:16.910
 then put a small daughter of those 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.910
 in the middle 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:30.400
 and now we 're going to run with the 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.400
 remaining mass 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:53.160
 and now we're going to take to roasting in 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:55.320
 oven preheated by 180 degrees during 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.490
 10 or 15 minutes or ten 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:59.310
 minutes, I think it 'll be ready 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.960
 because the molds are small then 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:03.030
 have to keep an eye on it not to burn 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:06.330
 when I started to loosen my lips fj 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:10.320
 ready whenever not so if the boards 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:13.440
 I cleaned with my finger because otherwise 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:15.990
 burns and smells burned and still 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:18.480
 the cupcakes are not ready and now 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:20.220
 let's get going then this is personal 

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:22.320
 the final result of our 

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:24.150
 today mine has become thinner than the 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.890
 normal because I 'm used half of the 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:29.040
 dough for making bread 

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:30.810
 this line that remained of chocolate for 

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:35.130
 on top of him that he had left a little bit 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:37.250
 in the pot of chocolate cookies and here 

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:40.530
 Are mine with cheese and chocolate? 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:43.110
 It's a delight I do not put them 

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:45.690
 draw with the inside because 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:48.360
 always pour some chocolate 

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:51.570
 melted go in then I wait 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:53.400
 after I shot him from the oven 

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:56.430
 I put it in the dishes so I can stay 

00:06:53.400 --> 00:07:00.140
 cute little gets super creamy inside 

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:02.790
 I had shown the side for you to see. 

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:05.400
 it's a delight 

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:08.790
 I hope you try this 

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:12.120
 recipe looks good the same way with 

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:14.400
 the one with that chocolate coating 

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:16.380
 I taught you in the other video. 

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:18.240
 I have explained that I will leave the 

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:22.080
 link below for you 

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:25.100
 and then that's how the dough gets really cute 

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:27.470
 well spongy because of the cold 

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:28.520
 and for what we add to it 

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:30.500
 was made 

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:32.960
