00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:17.060 

you

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.010 

well<00:00:17.610> you<00:00:18.029> know<00:00:18.119> again<00:00:18.360> I<00:00:18.420> think<00:00:18.570> it's<00:00:18.840> going

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
well you know again I think it's going

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.840 
well you know again I think it's going
to<00:00:19.080> be<00:00:19.140> a<00:00:19.260> just<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:19.949> big<00:00:20.310> boost<00:00:20.550> for<00:00:20.730> our

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
to be a just a big boost for our

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.880 
to be a just a big boost for our
football<00:00:21.060> program

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
football program

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.040 
football program
really<00:00:23.609> really<00:00:23.939> help<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:24.570> I<00:00:24.750> think<00:00:24.960> the

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
really really help and I think the

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.409 
really really help and I think the
timing<00:00:25.590> is<00:00:25.769> is<00:00:26.070> really<00:00:26.490> good<00:00:26.670> as<00:00:26.789> well<00:00:26.820> just

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:27.419 
timing is is really good as well just

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:29.810 
timing is is really good as well just
with<00:00:28.259> a<00:00:28.289> success<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:29.009> football<00:00:29.369> team<00:00:29.580> had

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
with a success the football team had

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.999 
with a success the football team had
last<00:00:30.119> year<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.779> fact<00:00:31.050> that<00:00:31.169> we<00:00:31.710> have<00:00:31.980> a

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
last year and the fact that we have a

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.280 
last year and the fact that we have a
young<00:00:32.309> team<00:00:32.520> so<00:00:33.059> I<00:00:33.329> think<00:00:33.660> that<00:00:33.809> will<00:00:34.079> come

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
young team so I think that will come

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.090 
young team so I think that will come
together<00:00:34.470> very<00:00:34.920> very<00:00:34.949> nicely<00:00:35.340> for<00:00:35.760> us

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.190 

break<00:00:38.699> the<00:00:38.940> facility

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
break the facility

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.850 
break the facility
we<00:00:40.770> really<00:00:41.070> focused<00:00:41.610> on<00:00:41.730> fan<00:00:42.060> experience<00:00:42.860> make

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
we really focused on fan experience make

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:52.980 
we really focused on fan experience make
sure<00:00:44.040> it's<00:00:44.460> not<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:44.640> bad<00:00:44.910> seat

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:52.990 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.120 

that<00:00:53.110> you<00:00:53.230> can<00:00:53.380> see<00:00:53.590> the<00:00:53.740> player

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:55.130 
that you can see the player

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.790 
that you can see the player
the<00:00:55.280> field<00:00:55.760> of<00:00:55.910> play<00:00:56.120> so<00:00:56.810> that's<00:00:57.440> certainly

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
the field of play so that's certainly

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.440 
the field of play so that's certainly
something<00:00:57.890> unique<00:00:58.520> we<00:00:58.850> were<00:00:58.970> able<00:00:59.060> to<00:00:59.240> bring

00:00:59.440 --> 00:00:59.450 
something unique we were able to bring

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.720 
something unique we were able to bring
down<00:00:59.840> the<00:01:00.340> the

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
down the the

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:10.880 
down the the
on<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.000> sweet<00:01:03.360> looking<00:01:03.930> club

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.399 

passing<00:01:11.820> in<00:01:11.940> the<00:01:11.970> state<00:01:12.300> as<00:01:12.570> 40

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
passing in the state as 40

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.249 
passing in the state as 40
can<00:01:14.409> change<00:01:14.740> and<00:01:15.630> approximately<00:01:16.630> half<00:01:17.079> of

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
can change and approximately half of

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:19.260 
can change and approximately half of
those<00:01:17.409> seats<00:01:17.710> are<00:01:17.860> below<00:01:18.130> great<00:01:18.490> so<00:01:18.880> the<00:01:19.000> field

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
those seats are below great so the field

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.249 
those seats are below great so the field
sits<00:01:19.659> about<00:01:20.259> 25<00:01:20.860> feet<00:01:20.890> below<00:01:21.340> the<00:01:21.610> concourse

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
sits about 25 feet below the concourse

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.389 
sits about 25 feet below the concourse
so<00:01:23.259> again<00:01:23.530> I<00:01:23.560> think<00:01:23.950> just<00:01:24.159> some<00:01:24.759> tremendous

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:26.399 
so again I think just some tremendous

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:29.910 
so again I think just some tremendous
views<00:01:27.399> and<00:01:27.960> certainly<00:01:28.960> given<00:01:29.289> Creek<00:01:29.530> great

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
views and certainly given Creek great

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.609 
views and certainly given Creek great
feel<00:01:30.420> we<00:01:31.420> did<00:01:31.600> some<00:01:31.810> other<00:01:31.930> things<00:01:32.049> in<00:01:32.439> terms

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 
feel we did some other things in terms

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:37.469 
feel we did some other things in terms
of<00:01:32.830> just<00:01:33.630> party<00:01:34.630> Dex<00:01:35.640> some<00:01:36.640> additional<00:01:37.119> sweet

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
of just party Dex some additional sweet

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.520 
of just party Dex some additional sweet
decks<00:01:37.810> so<00:01:38.229> just<00:01:39.100> some<00:01:39.250> unique<00:01:39.929> type<00:01:40.929> varieties

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
decks so just some unique type varieties

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.990 
decks so just some unique type varieties
of<00:01:41.770> seating<00:01:42.220> loge<00:01:42.610> boxes<00:01:43.679> so<00:01:44.679> the<00:01:45.340> staff<00:01:45.640> and

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
of seating loge boxes so the staff and

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.550 
of seating loge boxes so the staff and
the<00:01:46.060> architects<00:01:46.600> everybody<00:01:46.990> did<00:01:47.140> it<00:01:47.259> really<00:01:47.440> a

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
the architects everybody did it really a

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.130 
the architects everybody did it really a
terrific<00:01:48.009> job<00:01:48.600> that<00:01:49.600> the<00:01:49.690> footprint

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
terrific job that the footprint

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.680 
terrific job that the footprint
originally<00:01:50.679> was<00:01:50.860> 26<00:01:51.729> sweets<00:01:52.030> but<00:01:52.299> to<00:01:52.509> those

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
originally was 26 sweets but to those

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.960 
originally was 26 sweets but to those
are<00:01:52.899> doubled<00:01:53.289> so<00:01:53.530> the<00:01:53.709> actual<00:01:53.890> number<00:01:54.369> is<00:01:54.399> 24

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
are doubled so the actual number is 24

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.440 
are doubled so the actual number is 24
sweets<00:01:55.619> all<00:01:56.619> those<00:01:57.009> sold<00:01:57.369> except<00:01:57.759> for<00:01:57.940> two<00:01:58.119> and

sweets all those sold except for two and

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.770 
sweets all those sold except for two and

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.529 
we think we have the other two sold for
hopefully<00:02:01.959> we<00:02:02.170> have<00:02:02.319> the<00:02:02.440> other<00:02:02.560> two<00:02:02.679> soul<00:02:03.539> the
