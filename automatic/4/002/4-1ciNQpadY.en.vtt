00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:05.890
 the guys from youtube here I bring you the 

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:07.990
 second video as promised in the 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:12.190
 another video was going to bring them a video of 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:14.679
 about how to have military videos and their 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.240
 knots in your mind a little bit of editing what 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:18.940
 first we have to have and follow 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:23.980
 Play store and free apps are 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:26.920
 called pocket pocket inventor or something 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:30.270
 or even pronounce a new time 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:33.510
 but I did not kidnap something because 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:36.270
 and if not normal that they have differences 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.640
 but well once this is done, we 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.720
 let's go to our moment 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.790
 Some 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:47.930
 very important if not not going to 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:49.790
 work is that they have in the inventory 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.420
 they have to have something if not you can not 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:55.600
 by itself what I have a sword and that already 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.600
 is 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:04.600
 Then in another video I will teach you 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:09.630
 to do different things to say here 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:12.850
 this part we leave it is a policeman that 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.100
 it did not occur to me to do the good 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.409
 after that we already left is what 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.690
 only that we have to have the encouragement 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:21.149
 it is important that you do this follow what 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.390
 what am I doing 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:24.390
 thereafter 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:33.079
 but here they already select second as I 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:36.110
 I know of youtube visit and need to 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:40.880
 inventory and as good here I already have 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:42.939
 everything else is there is looking for it 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.009
 create the other one again 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:46.460
 information here we had never 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:49.070
 survival 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.060
 all this is timely is very good this 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.640
 application 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.000
 after that we are going to feed myself 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:02.830
 I said if that stone who is not as if 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:08.940
 they look for something but if they leave 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:08.940
 He said in the search for saying they want 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.330
 and torches 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:17.150
 and you have selected the damage that is nothing 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.770
 and much of that is what you will 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:29.370
 want to put the sector 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:32.310
 I stand back and do not see 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:35.730
 and something important I wanted to continue with 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:39.120
 the fourth finished and they already have it 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:44.879
 if she does not want to, she can look for it and 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:47.400
 they want modern 64 back and if you have a 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:51.180
 Once that's done, we 're going to touch 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.550
 of vision and how you see here 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:57.660
 I charged 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:03:00.650
 good already conquered torches that see 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:03.600
 that are served as normal cases 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.230
 time that is that is the amount that 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.230
 you want 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:17.250
 and after that, it works for them and 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:20.120
 everything else with something else is also that 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:24.000
 infinite life is very important that 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:26.940
 is you want the other is saved 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.630
 thing to why week opened the 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.620
 application 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:38.470
 and here they are put back in 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:40.120
 edith useful and not in information 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:44.310
 here I can change the time of the 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:47.459
 morning to night or next to move 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:50.459
 the fluctuation in the player here as 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:53.069
 come is the infinite life in the sea you 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:55.230
 they put and already it is the infinite life to all 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:58.349
 these right here you will be put 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:01.940
 the mercy they want possible are 50 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:01.940
 hearts and ready 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.530
 infinite and they have left everything how they see 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:10.020
 things a test it is important that 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:13.280

 and as good now I will try to 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:27.090
 make a lava 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:31.080

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:34.290

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.660
