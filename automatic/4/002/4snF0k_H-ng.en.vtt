00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.620
 hello to all today I you 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.320
 proposes to make a fresh entry 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.070
 and easy to make a goat terrine 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.880
 zucchini 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:22.390
 for that we need zucchini 150 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.220
 g of cheese spread like his death and 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:28.220
 150 g spreadable goat cheese 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.830
 type chavroux 100 g of white cheese a 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:34.429
 nice handle of fresh mint greeting 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.179
 tabasco garlic and a little salt and 

00:00:34.429 --> 00:00:36.739
 pepper 

00:00:35.179 --> 00:00:38.870
 to start we will mix our 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:41.949
 cheese spreads together at the 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.949
 fork roughly 

00:00:47.499 --> 00:00:56.179
 then we add the fromage blanc and 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:58.760
 mix well the idea there is to have 

00:00:56.179 --> 00:01:08.890
 something homogeneous we add 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:18.310
 our two peoples has 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:20.770
 and we mix the mint so 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.780
 fresh mint we got the 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.119
 leaves and we washed them of course where 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:28.300
 we make small packets and we cut 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:30.490
 scissors directly into the cheese 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.040
 so there for the quantity demand is 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.659
 a bit like you like 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.030
 if you not want to bother any 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:39.400
 this part there you can do it 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.590
 directly blender we are all in mx1 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:45.580
 blow and now we will now add 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:48.340
 the garlic we go there 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:51.940
 fluff the device the quantity die 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.960
 it's like you like a bridge of 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.720
 germs if needed 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.479
 a little tour in the meadow that's there 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.729
 directly in the dish if you want 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.070
 also have a taste of a little more 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.500
 light if you have this at home we 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:11.230
 replaced by garlic confit on 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:15.450
 add a little bit of tabasco hop on 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.450
 mix a good deal we go a little pepper 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.300
 you can also add a little bit of 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:28.190
 nutmeg ben it's optional 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:30.710
 but I like it is going very well 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.680
 with zucchini and finally a 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:37.700
 little pinch of salt we mix a 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.260
 little last time and now we're going 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.880
 take care of our zucchini 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.530
 course is in the vein zucchini 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.890
 before will now be cut into 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.470
 slices 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.060
 a little bit thick 3.4 mm pretty much 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.920
 to go faster I will use 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.510
 a mandolin like that it will be 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.930
 pretty well regular slices in my 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.700
 terrine 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:03:00.200
 but of course you can cut them at 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:03:02.240
 knife and now we will be able to 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.270
 prepare our terrine so we take a 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.250
 vector cake mold on it one can 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.440
 even if he is followed quad I 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.110
 prefer anyway had we will pay to 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:16.400
 about a third of the preparation hop 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:20.720
 in the background a little layer in the 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:22.000
 bottom that we divide we will put 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.590
 zucchini 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.320
 we align them well it will be more beautiful 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.959
 when we discover in the terrine we put in 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:32.390
 about half of the zucchini on 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:37.790
 add a little bit of our 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:41.060
 cheese a second third turn of 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.860
 make a little interlayer and 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.220
 we put back the rest of the bodies is 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.220
 now 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:57.330
 we bake in our oven preheated to 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:59.680
 180 Â° for forty minutes 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.360
 the hot and now creed 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.830
 we're going to leave her out 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.450
 cool down and once she's at 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.340
 room temperature we will put it at 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.930
 refrigerator must be roughly counted 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.460
 a night for it to take well 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.060
 it is easy to slice 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:12.040
 then 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.230
 and that's after enemies in the fridge 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.510
 game of mulema terrines and now 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.370
 she is ready to be tasted we see 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.769
 the pretty little layer of zucchini to 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.860
 inside this terrine is tightening 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.880
 would make a perfect meal 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.830
