international cable blade this one did

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.910 
international cable blade this one did
operate<00:00:46.890> I<00:00:47.280> was<00:00:47.969> backed<00:00:48.960> into<00:00:49.289> where<00:00:49.710> it's

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
operate I was backed into where it's

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.410 
operate I was backed into where it's
sitting<00:00:50.100> now<00:00:51.710> big<00:00:52.710> diesel<00:00:53.129> so<00:00:53.910> you<00:00:54.239> know<00:00:54.360> how

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
while since she operated again I'd go

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.580 
while since she operated again I'd go
and<00:01:09.119> crawl<00:01:09.360> all<00:01:09.570> over<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.140> get<00:01:10.260> model

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 
here again this years has shown me how

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.960 
here again this years has shown me how
fragile<00:01:59.860> some<00:02:00.860> of<00:02:00.980> these<00:02:01.040> big<00:02:01.280> monsters<00:02:01.760> are

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
fragile some of these big monsters are

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.200 
fragile some of these big monsters are
and<00:02:02.270> how<00:02:02.390> quickly<00:02:02.870> they<00:02:03.170> can<00:02:03.200> vanish<00:02:04.060> you<00:02:05.060> know

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
and how quickly they can vanish you know

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.639 
and how quickly they can vanish you know
a<00:02:05.420> machine<00:02:05.780> like<00:02:06.200> this<00:02:06.670> might<00:02:07.670> take<00:02:08.500> if<00:02:09.500> we're

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
a machine like this might take if we're

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.520 
a machine like this might take if we're
honest<00:02:10.060> five<00:02:11.060> six<00:02:11.360> seven<00:02:11.690> grand<00:02:11.960> to<00:02:12.200> get<00:02:12.320> it<00:02:12.410> up

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
honest five six seven grand to get it up

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.150 
honest five six seven grand to get it up
into<00:02:12.800> good<00:02:13.310> workable<00:02:14.150> condition<00:02:14.690> and<00:02:15.260> the

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
into good workable condition and the

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.670 
into good workable condition and the
thing<00:02:16.370> as<00:02:16.550> it<00:02:16.580> sits<00:02:16.910> is<00:02:17.180> is<00:02:17.900> worth<00:02:18.260> four<00:02:18.620> or

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
thing as it sits is is worth four or

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.510 
thing as it sits is is worth four or
five<00:02:18.860> grand<00:02:19.220> for<00:02:19.400> scrap<00:02:19.700> and<00:02:20.920> you<00:02:21.920> know<00:02:22.040> so

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
five grand for scrap and you know so

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.390 
five grand for scrap and you know so
much<00:02:22.870> so<00:02:23.870> much<00:02:23.990> vanishes<00:02:24.560> so<00:02:24.590> quickly<00:02:27.310> and<00:02:28.310> I

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
much so much vanishes so quickly and I

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.710 
much so much vanishes so quickly and I
don't<00:02:28.580> know<00:02:28.670> if<00:02:28.790> it's<00:02:28.910> worth<00:02:29.090> Savin<00:02:29.480> or<00:02:29.570> not

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
don't know if it's worth Savin or not

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.570 
don't know if it's worth Savin or not
but<00:02:30.020> I<00:02:31.090> do<00:02:32.090> like<00:02:32.390> them
