hi I'm Albert with hillside tire I'm

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.759 
hi I'm Albert with hillside tire I'm
here<00:00:07.950> today<00:00:08.069> talking<00:00:08.429> about<00:00:08.730> lift<00:00:09.360> and

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:09.769 
here today talking about lift and

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
modification with custom wheels and

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.620 
modification with custom wheels and
tires<00:00:19.289> make<00:00:19.710> it<00:00:19.859> look<00:00:20.039> good<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:20.310> perform<00:00:21.029> if

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
tires make it look good and perform if

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.240 
tires make it look good and perform if
you<00:00:21.840> want<00:00:22.020> to<00:00:22.080> go<00:00:22.170> off-road<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:22.650> or<00:00:22.980> if<00:00:23.100> you

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
you want to go off-road and or if you

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.290 
you want to go off-road and or if you
just<00:00:23.369> want<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:23.850> show<00:00:24.150> truck<00:00:25.490> basically<00:00:26.490> when<00:00:27.090> we

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
just want a show truck basically when we

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.230 
just want a show truck basically when we
do<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.900> lift<00:00:28.230> kit<00:00:28.470> it<00:00:29.160> does<00:00:29.400> remove<00:00:29.730> some<00:00:30.060> of<00:00:30.179> the

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
do a lift kit it does remove some of the

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.680 
do a lift kit it does remove some of the
components<00:00:30.900> so<00:00:31.850> you're<00:00:32.850> dropping<00:00:33.149> down<00:00:33.480> your

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
components so you're dropping down your

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.200 
components so you're dropping down your
whole<00:00:33.870> suspension<00:00:34.380> underneath<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.250> car<00:00:35.489> you

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
whole suspension underneath the car you

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.959 
whole suspension underneath the car you
know<00:00:36.270> either<00:00:36.480> that<00:00:36.630> 4<00:00:37.050> or<00:00:37.350> 6<00:00:37.620> inches<00:00:38.100> different

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
know either that 4 or 6 inches different

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.000 
know either that 4 or 6 inches different
vehicles<00:00:39.480> allow<00:00:39.930> for<00:00:40.230> different<00:00:40.559> types<00:00:40.829> of

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
vehicles allow for different types of

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.450 
vehicles allow for different types of
lifts<00:00:41.340> as<00:00:41.460> well<00:00:42.680> basically<00:00:43.680> it<00:00:43.829> changes<00:00:44.280> all

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
lifts as well basically it changes all

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.790 
lifts as well basically it changes all
your<00:00:44.670> stuff<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.180> then<00:00:45.719> it<00:00:46.020> drops<00:00:46.320> everything

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
your stuff and then it drops everything

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.920 
your stuff and then it drops everything
down<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:47.219> realigns<00:00:47.700> it<00:00:48.000> so<00:00:48.300> you<00:00:48.360> still<00:00:48.510> get<00:00:48.870> a

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
down and realigns it so you still get a

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.750 
down and realigns it so you still get a
good<00:00:49.170> smooth<00:00:49.530> comfortable<00:00:50.010> ride<00:00:50.160> with<00:00:50.610> your

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
good smooth comfortable ride with your

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.420 
good smooth comfortable ride with your
vehicle<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.530> without<00:00:52.530> being<00:00:52.980> just<00:00:53.250> that

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
vehicle and without being just that

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.260 
vehicle and without being just that
rough<00:00:53.879> right<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.329> hay<00:00:54.480> wagon<00:00:55.699> all<00:00:56.699> right<00:00:56.910> then

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
rough right and hay wagon all right then

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.939 
rough right and hay wagon all right then
lift<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.690> vehicle<00:00:58.289> there's<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.530> couple<00:00:58.770> of

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
lift and vehicle there's a couple of

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.599 
lift and vehicle there's a couple of
different<00:00:59.280> components<00:00:59.539> that<00:01:01.219> you<00:01:02.219> need<00:01:02.250> to

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
different components that you need to

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.000 
different components that you need to
make<00:01:03.000> sure<00:01:03.180> are<00:01:03.570> done<00:01:03.809> with<00:01:04.350> good<00:01:04.530> quality

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
make sure are done with good quality

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.730 
make sure are done with good quality
parts<00:01:05.519> one<00:01:06.150> would<00:01:06.450> be<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.780> shock<00:01:07.049> absorber

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
parts one would be the shock absorber

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.340 
parts one would be the shock absorber
right<00:01:08.130> in<00:01:08.310> here<00:01:08.610> that's<00:01:09.450> basically<00:01:10.020> what

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
right in here that's basically what

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.320 
right in here that's basically what
controls<00:01:10.890> your<00:01:11.010> ride<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.640> keeps<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.119> tire

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
controls your ride that keeps the tire

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.890 
controls your ride that keeps the tire
flat<00:01:13.229> on<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.590> ground<00:01:13.860> in<00:01:14.189> all<00:01:14.850> situations<00:01:15.720> as

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
flat on the ground in all situations as

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.830 
flat on the ground in all situations as
far<00:01:15.930> as<00:01:16.170> accelerating<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.250> braking<00:01:17.479> so<00:01:18.479> it

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
far as accelerating and braking so it

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.890 
far as accelerating and braking so it
gives<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.350> control<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.460> stability<00:01:21.060> when<00:01:21.869> you

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
gives you control and stability when you

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.170 
gives you control and stability when you
need<00:01:22.229> it<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.470> most<00:01:22.700> there's<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.759> couple<00:01:24.060> other

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
need it the most there's a couple other

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.090 
need it the most there's a couple other
things<00:01:24.270> as<00:01:24.750> far<00:01:24.960> as<00:01:24.990> like<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.290> control<00:01:25.799> herbs

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
things as far as like the control herbs

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.859 
things as far as like the control herbs
and<00:01:26.460> each<00:01:26.759> vehicle<00:01:27.060> is<00:01:27.360> going<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.570> be<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.659> little

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
and each vehicle is going to be a little

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.420 
and each vehicle is going to be a little
different<00:01:28.110> some<00:01:28.439> of<00:01:28.560> them<00:01:28.650> have<00:01:28.799> independent

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
different some of them have independent

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.460 
different some of them have independent
suspension<00:01:29.970> like<00:01:30.119> this<00:01:30.360> one<00:01:30.600> some<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.350> them

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
suspension like this one some of them

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.030 
suspension like this one some of them
will<00:01:31.560> have<00:01:31.590> solid<00:01:32.159> axles<00:01:32.930> the<00:01:33.930> drive<00:01:34.229> axle<00:01:34.799> is

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
will have solid axles the drive axle is

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.249 
will have solid axles the drive axle is
one<00:01:35.729> as<00:01:35.939> well<00:01:36.210> because<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:36.869> want<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.140> make

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
one as well because you want to make

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.260 
one as well because you want to make
sure<00:01:37.290> your<00:01:37.650> angle<00:01:38.009> on<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.220> drive<00:01:38.460> axle<00:01:39.000> is

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
sure your angle on the drive axle is

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.300 
sure your angle on the drive axle is
adequate<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.259> way<00:01:40.439> you're<00:01:40.619> not<00:01:40.650> getting<00:01:41.009> any

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
adequate that way you're not getting any

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.969 
adequate that way you're not getting any
vibration<00:01:42.030> out<00:01:42.180> of<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:43.320> do<00:01:43.470> have<00:01:43.649> a<00:01:43.710> couple

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
vibration out of it you do have a couple

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.130 
vibration out of it you do have a couple
other<00:01:44.250> things<00:01:44.310> like<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.880> sway<00:01:45.450> bar<00:01:45.689> end<00:01:45.720> links

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
other things like the sway bar end links
