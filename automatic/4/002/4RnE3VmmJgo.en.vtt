finger<00:00:53.699> detangling<00:00:54.590> regimen<00:00:55.590> but<00:00:55.890> I<00:00:56.160> like<00:00:56.969> to

finger detangling regimen but I like to

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.660

use<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.390> key<00:00:57.570> word<00:00:57.600> do<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:58.170> get<00:00:58.949> any<00:00:59.160> kinks<00:00:59.550> out

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.260 
those three sections so I'm gonna end up
with<00:04:06.170> a<00:04:06.230> total<00:04:06.440> of<00:04:06.620> 18<00:04:06.740> chunky<00:04:07.730> twists<00:04:08.120> and

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:08.270 
with a total of 18 chunky twists and

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.990 
with a total of 18 chunky twists and
this<00:04:08.420> is<00:04:08.600> my<00:04:09.200> foundation<00:04:09.440> for<00:04:10.280> whatever<00:04:10.520> hair

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
this is my foundation for whatever hair

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.240 
this is my foundation for whatever hair
so<00:04:11.209> I'm<00:04:11.360> gonna<00:04:11.480> do<00:04:11.750> so<00:04:12.050> these<00:04:12.350> twists<00:04:12.830> might<00:04:13.070> be

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
so I'm gonna do so these twists might be

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.310 
so I'm gonna do so these twists might be
coming<00:04:13.610> up<00:04:13.820> to<00:04:14.060> the<00:04:14.300> next<00:04:14.480> day<00:04:14.690> I<00:04:14.720> might<00:04:15.110> wear

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:15.320 
coming up to the next day I might wear

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.949 
coming up to the next day I might wear
it<00:04:15.350> twist<00:04:15.709> out<00:04:15.920> it<00:04:16.280> might<00:04:17.000> become<00:04:17.420> a<00:04:17.450> braid<00:04:17.930> out

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
it twist out it might become a braid out

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.630 
it twist out it might become a braid out
it<00:04:18.260> might<00:04:18.410> become<00:04:18.650> a<00:04:18.709> bantu<00:04:19.100> knot<00:04:19.250> out<00:04:19.280> but

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:19.640 
it might become a bantu knot out but

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.510 
it might become a bantu knot out but
this<00:04:19.850> is<00:04:20.030> just<00:04:20.299> how<00:04:20.720> I<00:04:21.140> always<00:04:21.530> start<00:04:22.280> every

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
this is just how I always start every

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.670 
this is just how I always start every
hairstyle<00:04:22.910> it's<00:04:23.330> really<00:04:23.660> easy<00:04:23.870> for<00:04:24.230> me<00:04:24.320> to<00:04:24.350> do

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
hairstyle it's really easy for me to do

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.500 
hairstyle it's really easy for me to do
and<00:04:24.920> it's<00:04:25.400> a<00:04:25.490> great<00:04:25.640> way<00:04:25.850> to<00:04:25.880> keep<00:04:26.150> my<00:04:26.300> hair

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
and it's a great way to keep my hair

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.720 
and it's a great way to keep my hair
stretched<00:04:26.900> and<00:04:27.200> to<00:04:28.010> maintain<00:04:28.190> the<00:04:28.550> moisture

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:28.730 
stretched and to maintain the moisture

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.390 
stretched and to maintain the moisture
that<00:04:29.150> I<00:04:29.300> just<00:04:29.510> worked<00:04:29.750> so<00:04:29.900> hard<00:04:30.170> for<00:04:30.770> several

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
that I just worked so hard for several

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.330 
that I just worked so hard for several
hours<00:04:31.550> maybe<00:04:32.510> like<00:04:32.780> a<00:04:32.810> total<00:04:33.200> of<00:04:33.380> three<00:04:34.310> hours

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
hours maybe like a total of three hours

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:46.959 
hours maybe like a total of three hours
the<00:04:34.970> whole<00:04:35.090> process<00:04:35.360> takes<00:04:35.720> me

00:04:46.959 --> 00:04:46.969 

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:49.729 

so<00:04:47.969> now<00:04:48.149> before<00:04:48.299> I<00:04:48.509> go<00:04:48.659> to<00:04:48.719> bed<00:04:48.929> I<00:04:48.959> tend<00:04:49.439> to<00:04:49.529> put

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:49.739 
so now before I go to bed I tend to put

00:04:49.739 --> 00:04:52.429 
so now before I go to bed I tend to put
my<00:04:49.859> twist<00:04:49.919> into<00:04:50.489> a<00:04:50.669> loose<00:04:51.059> ponytail<00:04:51.329> this<00:04:52.229> just

00:04:52.429 --> 00:04:52.439 
my twist into a loose ponytail this just

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:54.019 
my twist into a loose ponytail this just
helps<00:04:52.589> to<00:04:52.799> keep<00:04:52.949> them<00:04:53.159> stretched<00:04:53.489> overnight

00:04:54.019 --> 00:04:54.029 
helps to keep them stretched overnight

00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:56.449 
helps to keep them stretched overnight
so<00:04:54.329> that<00:04:54.539> they<00:04:54.839> don't<00:04:54.959> shrink<00:04:55.349> up<00:04:55.619> and<00:04:55.919> create

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:56.459 
so that they don't shrink up and create

00:04:56.459 --> 00:04:58.489 
so that they don't shrink up and create
dickless<00:04:56.879> them<00:04:57.089> out<00:04:57.239> by<00:04:57.779> the<00:04:57.839> time<00:04:58.109> I<00:04:58.139> wake<00:04:58.319> up

00:04:58.489 --> 00:04:58.499 
dickless them out by the time I wake up

00:04:58.499 --> 00:05:00.559 
dickless them out by the time I wake up
in<00:04:58.649> the<00:04:58.679> morning<00:04:59.099> so<00:04:59.579> that's<00:04:59.759> my<00:04:59.999> regimen<00:05:00.539> I
