00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 Hi there before you 2 part of my 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.509
 video about hair care him i 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.220
 I will tell you about how I managed 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.889
 achieve such softness and smoothness and 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.179
 shine and elasticity of hair in the first 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.830
 I note that my hair is from 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.630
 natures are very subtle so they are easy 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.330
 tangled and torn and the ship in the wind 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.910
 that is why I try them without much 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.519
 between not let loose in the wind in the cold 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.960
 in the strong sun while playing sports i 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.730
 I try to keep them in a pigtail 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.980
 However, this does not mean that I 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.900
 constantly wear only capable of any 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.880
 let loose a little 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.980
 gum spat unlike many i 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.840
 live on our climate I think that he 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.760
 much better to fix the hair than 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.030
 dissolve the assignment to triumph then 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.340
 they 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:45.000
 messed up and torn when combing 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:48.120
 and on so i'm using here such here 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.800
 little gum fell lady collection 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.899
 they are well fixed to the guest book 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.149
 tail of us high tail to just not 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.829
 fix for quite some time instead 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.320
 balm in hair conditioner 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.180
 i use cosmetic masks they me 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.949
 constantly are different, I love you too 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.019
 try new unlike shield not 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.880
 from what I tried for the last 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:10.549
 a couple of years I can distinguish Moscow pink 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.229
 she's very nice thick good 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:14.630
 condition hair does not contain 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:17.450
 silicone and it is very important to someone 2 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.009
 Masochka is such a pink Thai 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.630
 planeta organica mask 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:23.630
 in fact they Aqaba pink 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.159
 coincidence me appeared principle all 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.350
 Moscow on this organic here that I have 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:28.789
 Now there is a tone in stock and perhaps this 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.619
 one of the best of them 

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:32.929
 the only drawback is not very 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:35.270
 pleasant aroma but basically after 

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:37.399
 the museum she almost does not remain if 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.409
 someone interested in it contains silicone 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:42.530
 couple of words about silicones because such 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:45.380
 questions often worth I can't answer 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.780
 for all I can not say exactly how your 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.729
 hair will be shocked and silicone mike 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.670
 they are treated very well 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.200
 positively important remember that silicone 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.729
 and does not treat and does not set our 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.740
 hair as it likes to talk 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.110
 different commercials they are only 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.030
 help us care for him with others 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.590
 words thanks to hair silicones better 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.049
 combing becomes smoother 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.030
 and air conditioned less 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:08.860
 electrifying is also important especially in 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.959
 winter period 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.370
 that is why everyone loves so indelibly 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.049
 funds that can be applied to 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.840
 tips and because of this the end is not 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:20.630
 confused well raschuvstvuetsya 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:23.120
 at the same time here is my personal hair 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.980
 after silicone does not dry and does not deteriorate 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.959
 I had periods of weeks 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.940
 used fully exit code beads 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.859
 I didn't use cosmetics 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.850
 generally came completely natural 

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:33.950
 detergent 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.380
 while the hair is not spoiled they are not 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.019
 dried did not become tougher except that 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.840
 the very tips that have not been 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:43.430
 were cut one centimeter from 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.310
 ends the only fundamental 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.050
 the difference is that without 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.610
 hair becomes lighter 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.380
 fluffy such air as in 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.420
 childhood and with more electrified 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.459
 some believe that there is no point 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.260
 apply oil mask on hair if 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.270
 before that they were affected 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.250
 Silicone products in my opinion again 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.080
 there is no problem in this oil 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.720
 just good clean hair from 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.160
 silicones and perfectly penetrates 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.160
 oil masks I use the last 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.989
 six to seven years and at the same time 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.760
 I use silicone containing cosmetics 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.930
 but the hair does not fundamentally change 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.300
 become much softer 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.190
 more elastic and elastic and at the same time 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.450
 I can reflect and much longer 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.450
 before something failed 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.160
 that's why I'm sure that butter 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.930
 no masks work even though 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.390
 that I continue to use silicone and 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.130
 the main thing in this matter is just aware 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.630
 that oil masks they are just personally 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.760
 set our hair and 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.950
 long term they do not act 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.569
 immediately and silicone containing agents 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.849
 need excluded to maintain 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:41.620
 constructive effects so that hair does not 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:43.510
 fluffed and not electrified bad 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.310
 on feel precisely for this for 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.440
 creating a functioning effects 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.920
 hair and i use indelible 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.859
 facilities 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:53.680
 Well, a few words about my spirit and again the wardrobe 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:55.989
 here it is the favorite means of clothing and in 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.329
 rumor cream foam with parallel 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:59.859
 using them is enough for about 22 seconds 

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:02.440
 half year therefore despite 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:04.780
 high price together they cost about 2000 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.410
 I think it is quite justified because 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:10.870
 The products are very efficient and cost effective. 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.310
 clothes it is generally mast hev which 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.709
 I have a few years 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.900
 she is fine because it does not weigh down 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:19.000
 hair at the same time smooths them well and 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.489
 does not allow them to electrify 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.560
 while it can be used as 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:24.010
 steel in the head means and as protection against 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.020
 the sun 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.090
 the climate I also love him very tender 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.190
 create such a light volume on the hair but 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.530
 not radical but in length 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:33.960
 such a soft pleasant weight too 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.340
 makes combing great 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.190
 smoothing torture the hair softness and 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:42.250
 two more new ones that we tried 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:45.580
 this will jump off and moisturizing the chents i 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:48.070
 Spray spent very light fine 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.560
 struggling with electrifying hair while he 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:52.479
 they do not weigh down at all many 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.610
 means scolded say that we 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:56.530
 completely ineffective and on the hair 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:58.120
 nikol effect does not create not worth 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.729
 probably all to expect from cosmetic 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.350
 means of some kind of wow effect they 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:04.810
 principle does not restore if the hair 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.610
 Well, it's very dry hard then no 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.500
 wash off and now no mask and 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.760
 What shampoo they will not save such hair 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.130
 need to move the United States 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.750
 another thing is that if you do not wait 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.160
 you just need good 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.020
 conditioning means which 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.840
 cope with vectorization 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.639
 Spray her suitable for him pretty 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.860
 economical while not worth it 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:25.750
 Exactly this spray for me 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.240
 perfect addition to the oil mask 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:30.190
 it happens that after washing off the oil 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.169
 hair smooth and cosmetic mask 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.360
 like and need not only is she 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:35.979
 excessive weight but even so 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.229
 hair needs protection from 

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:40.539
 static electricity and this spray 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:43.240
 what you need hair remains light but 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:45.669
 do not electrify and finally the Athenian 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:48.099
 the reason I really liked it 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:50.710
 that it can be used and as a mask as 

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:52.960
 bottom mom for this reason is very convenient 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:55.030
 take money with you on trips 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:58.330
 beautiful smells easily washed off well 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:06:00.580
 condition the hair does not weigh down when 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:02.680
 this is very economical quality 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.780
 indelible means but as a mask here 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:07.210
 a bit watery so you want 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:09.940
 apply more compare very 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:12.280
 I liked all the listed not smiles 

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:14.020
 the product contains silicone and I think that 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:16.539
 it is due to this that does not create a good 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:18.159
 antistatic effect in the summer without such 

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:20.139
 funds can be dispensed with but only if you 

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:21.789
 don't stay put in the sun but here 

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:23.949
 in the winter I think they are very useful 

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:25.750
 because electrification leads to 

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:28.090
 hair tangles for what they are also 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:30.159
 may well be torn in general 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:31.659
 wanted to say in this part next 

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:33.580
 video will share with you my favorite 

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:35.210
 home recipes tell you what I do 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.130
 I use most often what 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:39.440
 most of all, that is, it will be already 

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:41.569
 the story is not about cosmetics but domestic mass 

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:44.889
 what for all of you thanks for your attention
