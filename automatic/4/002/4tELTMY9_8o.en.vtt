00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.009
 so let's go with the video and to do 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.109
 this tutorial we're going to need what 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:12.080
 main one so much they sell it in 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:14.180
 any store and they are half of the 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:18.190
 videos 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:20.500
 normal and a little water 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:23.650
 for our first kind of small 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.900
 use special ham or ham 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.520
 special and cheese 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.460
 The only thing I have to do is that in 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:34.150
 my sheet of huanta I do not have it 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:36.700
 put like this accommodate the good by taking my 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:39.370
 filling in this case without ham if it is 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.840
 very big I can cut it with a 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.090
 knife 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.649
 and just putting half depends on each 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:49.070
 one depends on how we fit 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:49.070
 accommodated in the small 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:56.560
 put our cheese on top we can 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.690
 fold also 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.120
 how to give the colon as well as 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:04.350
 more mind 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.350
 and close our little 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.120
 to do it we just have to go 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.350
 rolling like angol 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.560
 [Music] 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:17.320
 and from here in this part of here with the 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.860
 basic water I said wet it our 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.800
 ye half of our fingers 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.600
 and put it all over the edge 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:30.159
 and close them 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.450
 this is going to hit our enduring now 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:33.790
 all we have to do is deny 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.190
 the extremes 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.960
 well here we have the first small and 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.850
 is sealed with the top 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:44.030
 we did not know we pressed it a little bit 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:46.909
 with water and we do with others 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.880
 for our next little single 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.850
 let's grab little bacon and a 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.490
 little bit of cheese 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.380
 [Music] 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.070
 and putting it in the same way that 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.470
 make up 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.460
 and roll up 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:05.130
 [Music] 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.140
 putting the tips together you know that 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.380
 pouring a little water with the 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:13.760
 fingertips 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:16.790
 in order to seal what we raise 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.730
 and closed 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.950
 it has to be tightly closed so that it does not 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:26.140
 you know 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.140
 and also from the extremes 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.920
 and that 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:34.239
 here are our little ones the smart ones 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:37.030
 to ask and smile 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:40.580
 very advanced and that they keep it for 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.440
 well because the merits for our 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:47.470
 guacamole we're just going to need a 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.470
 avocado and we will remove the pepa 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.790
 little pepper little salt and a 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.190
 little piece of lemon to give it a little 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.630
 about two or three drops of good lemon 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:01.060
 with the avocado, the only thing you have to do 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.060
 is crushing it with a fork 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.860
 even appreciated as a pasta 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.800
 once there is already a lot in how he lives 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.250
 this what we are going to do is 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.150
 throw our pepper 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.150
 our salt 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.180
 with three drops of lemon 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.520
 many and move them 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.270
 [Music] 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:45.129
 and ready our guacamole and nothing but 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:45.129
 wait for our little ones 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.760
 [Music] 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:53.150
 I just put my little ones and they're 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.820
 almost ready only while moving 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.490
 peephole these expenses are burning 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:01.750
 these makes super quickie 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:03.730
 and I have a good and with luck 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.430
 we see that they end up browning like another 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:09.130
 part and in the Chinese garlic as in a 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:11.819
 little dish with a little affection there for 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.439
 that the oil drips 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:16.100
 and here we are going to be our 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:19.070
 delicious small 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:22.750
 fried and ready to eat so far 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.750
 we have all these recipes thanks 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:32.959
 [Music] 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.470
