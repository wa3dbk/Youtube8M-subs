 Google g1 connects to another Google device 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:13.849
 I have to go HTC Touch HD 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.939
 the Google g1 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:22.470

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:38.510
 activate Blue do 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.510
 Porta a Porta is activated 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.600
 already via Bluetooth SIG Inc 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.690
 and kloeckner and Discover New Web Pages AMI

 Arp here are the keyboards 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.260

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.060

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.690
 against the clock setting 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.030
 we are looking for devices here 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.200
 then there must be 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.950
 in a few seconds that 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.950
 the 1 appear 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.120
 they would do that 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.170
 click Next 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.840
 against here a password 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.390

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.130
 OK 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.190
