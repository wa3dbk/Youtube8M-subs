00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.300 
assembled and put my spool line on here
now<00:02:24.450> one<00:02:24.660> thing<00:02:24.870> that<00:02:24.930> I<00:02:25.140> will<00:02:25.410> say<00:02:25.440> that<00:02:26.280> I

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
now one thing that I will say that I

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.670 
now one thing that I will say that I
have<00:02:26.640> found<00:02:26.940> so<00:02:27.540> far<00:02:27.569> about<00:02:28.140> this<00:02:28.380> product

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
have found so far about this product

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.880 
have found so far about this product
that<00:02:29.160> I<00:02:29.190> do<00:02:29.340> not<00:02:29.700> like<00:02:30.319> is<00:02:33.349> that<00:02:34.349> I<00:02:34.470> typically

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
that I do not like is that I typically

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.580 
that I do not like is that I typically
by<00:02:35.160> very<00:02:35.610> large<00:02:35.910> spools<00:02:36.420> of<00:02:36.750> fishing<00:02:37.110> line<00:02:37.260> and

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
by very large spools of fishing line and

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.589 
by very large spools of fishing line and
it<00:02:40.590> would<00:02:41.069> not<00:02:41.250> accommodate<00:02:42.000> these<00:02:42.239> large

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
it would not accommodate these large

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:46.339 
it would not accommodate these large
spools<00:02:42.989> of<00:02:43.260> line<00:02:44.030> so<00:02:45.030> I<00:02:45.390> had<00:02:45.750> to<00:02:45.870> go<00:02:46.019> to<00:02:46.080> a

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
spools of line so I had to go to a

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:48.920 
spools of line so I had to go to a
quarter<00:02:46.739> pound<00:02:46.980> spool<00:02:47.340> of<00:02:47.640> fishing<00:02:48.180> line<00:02:48.329> for

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
quarter pound spool of fishing line for

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.990 
quarter pound spool of fishing line for
that<00:02:49.079> purpose

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.360 

so<00:02:54.000> what<00:02:54.180> I'm<00:02:54.299> doing<00:02:54.329> here<00:02:55.049> is<00:02:55.200> just

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.440 

tightening<00:02:59.370> this<00:02:59.549> up<00:02:59.610> I<00:03:00.000> should<00:03:00.060> have<00:03:00.269> left

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
tightening this up I should have left

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.330 
tightening this up I should have left
that<00:03:00.660> line<00:03:00.900> taped<00:03:01.349> down<00:03:02.360> is<00:03:04.160> tightening<00:03:05.160> these

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
that line taped down is tightening these

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.270 
that line taped down is tightening these
little<00:03:05.870> deals<00:03:06.870> up<00:03:07.170> here<00:03:07.440> so<00:03:07.680> there's<00:03:07.980> plenty

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
little deals up here so there's plenty

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.780 
little deals up here so there's plenty
of<00:03:08.370> tension<00:03:08.640> on<00:03:09.060> that<00:03:09.349> spool<00:03:10.349> of<00:03:10.530> fishing<00:03:10.950> line

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.580 

and<00:03:14.790> I'm<00:03:14.910> going<00:03:15.090> to<00:03:15.120> line<00:03:15.389> this<00:03:15.750> back<00:03:16.079> up<00:03:16.380> here

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
and I'm going to line this back up here

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.120 
and I'm going to line this back up here
make<00:03:19.590> this<00:03:19.829> a<00:03:19.889> little<00:03:20.160> bit<00:03:20.400> easier<00:03:21.799> so<00:03:22.799> I<00:03:22.829> don't

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
make this a little bit easier so I don't

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.920 
make this a little bit easier so I don't
have<00:03:23.280> all<00:03:23.340> this<00:03:23.670> excess<00:03:24.239> line<00:03:24.540> that<00:03:24.810> I'm

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930

that<00:07:18.229> I<00:07:18.260> have<00:07:18.620> about<00:07:18.919> it<00:07:18.979> is<00:07:20.320> that<00:07:21.320> it<00:07:22.220> would

00:07:22.779 --> 00:07:22.789 
that I have about it is that it would

00:07:22.789 --> 00:07:26.580 
that I have about it is that it would
not<00:07:23.060> accommodate<00:07:23.600> the<00:07:24.350> larger<00:07:25.160> spools<00:07:26.150> of

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:28.780 
fishing line that I typically use

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:31.690 
fishing line that I typically use
because<00:07:29.780> the<00:07:30.139> hole<00:07:30.380> here<00:07:30.950> and<00:07:31.160> the<00:07:31.250> center<00:07:31.610> of

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:31.700 
because the hole here and the center of

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:36.279 
because the hole here and the center of
the<00:07:31.789> line<00:07:31.970> was<00:07:33.250> too<00:07:34.250> big<00:07:34.490> so<00:07:35.389> I'm<00:07:35.840> not<00:07:36.139> actually

00:07:36.279 --> 00:07:36.289 
the line was too big so I'm not actually

00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:38.110 
the line was too big so I'm not actually
going<00:07:36.530> to<00:07:36.590> take<00:07:36.740> a<00:07:36.770> wooden<00:07:37.190> dowel<00:07:37.430> and<00:07:37.789> see<00:07:38.030> if

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:39.500 
I find a wooden dowel that will fit down

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:41.230 
I find a wooden dowel that will fit down
