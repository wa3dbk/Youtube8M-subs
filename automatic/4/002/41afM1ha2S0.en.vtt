00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:07.500
 today's video will be about cooking 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:10.950
 dried hard cheese for seasoning 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.920
 well, or people who go hiking 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.920
 it will be very nutritious so that 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.160
 cheesy nutritional powder or the same as 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.270
 seasoning to spaghetti and the like 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.750
 things who love how 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.130
 means and where I looked this recipe we 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.220
 in Irkutsk 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.869
 often became all friends and here in 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.460
 the last time they treated us like that 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.870
 seasoning means got a jar of 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.690
 the refrigerators say well let's it him 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.450
 you to the noodles cinema sypham and poured 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:43.320
 dried hard cheese I will say so 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.270
 impression cool in this opinion 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.309
 The message of this seasoning was perfect 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.120
 I liked different children 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:54.090
 Well, someone somehow say not that 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.710
 coldly reacted neutrally to this 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.449
 that someone didnâ€™t like her husband 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.149
 liked too says how dry 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.859
 I liked the powder 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.870
 people like it so if you are lovers 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.960
 such things this recipe will be for you 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.439
 so firstly I will show how to dry 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.290
 Secondly, this cheese will show you how little 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:19.619
 what then to powder and thirdly want 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:21.960
 read out means fresh cheese 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.110
 how much will our dry here 200 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:29.280
 gram what are we gonna do this my 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:33.119
 we will rub on a large grater further we take 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:37.770
 dryer decompose cheese 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:39.750
 I will say at once that why not 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.970
 I wanted to cut the pieces can of course 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.079
 chop cheese and dry plastic 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.670
 such plates 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.850
 but because then we will 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.979
 I will grind much easier 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.340
 to do it here with such slices because 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.140
 that a coffee grinder may not take large 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.270
 pieces 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.590
 so I also want to add the weight of the cheese 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.020
 will be different 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.000
 I jellyfish 200 grams will go different 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.979
 amount of cheese depending on 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.990
 humidity scheme that they bought but 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.179
 approximately we can see that 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.250
 there is a plus or minus it is already we took 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.319
 such a tight cheese that is very easy 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.590
 rubs 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:19.329
 eat cheese and eat less cheese 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:22.370
 such here are just good elastic not soft 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:23.420
 let's see how much of this cheese 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:29.150
 we will succeed 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:31.489
 dry all leave to dry on 65 want 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.250
 note that you can also dry 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:37.219
 cottage cheese 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:40.069
 those who do not eat this to the store 

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:41.419
 and you can also make a spice from it 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:44.379
 when drying cheese 

00:02:41.419 --> 00:02:49.480
 sire lets you keep that fat 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:53.599
 floor cheese that's what we did cheese 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:56.329
 it dried completely the only thing that we 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:57.319
 set it all to dry at night we don't 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:59.329
 checked 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.219
 exactly how much exactly is the number he 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:01.939
 dried but from the moment we 

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:04.489
 put 

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:06.919
 and turned off the dryer saw core here 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:09.049
 state passed means eleven s 

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:10.370
 half a hour I think he used to 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:13.299
 vyser just need this moment 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:16.790
 control but look what happened 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:17.629
 gathered gathered oil gathered 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.900
 separately 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:24.259
 so he needs when she starts 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:27.979
 from here you want to speak clean up 

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:31.489
 merge somewhere and that means I merged part 

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:34.489
 fat but part of it soaked up in the ussr 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:36.919
 what do we do now we have this chain perry 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:39.370
 put on a clean sheet of paper under which 

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:42.379
 bed already 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:45.530
 so that the cheese comes into contact with a clean sheet 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:48.440
 first and we put it and put 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.990
 let us absorb the paper to 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:56.630
 speed up the process I'm still on top 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:59.720
 put the paper back the same use 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:04.400
 I will cover and load anything unnecessary 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:07.130
 and let absorbed well here while I 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.840
 engaged saw both about an hour or two I 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:11.870
 no controller that time just put and 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:16.310
 gone gray born less dry 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:18.850
 now we will proceed next and so 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:23.150
 Now we will see how much we got 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:26.090
 100 grams of cheese will be considered 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:28.850
 decreases only twice we had 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.200
 200 grams came out 100 dry now we 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:35.110
 take a coffee grinder 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:35.110
 and try it all now grind 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:51.040
 As a result, we got this 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:54.120
 great baby well what do we sprinkle all 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:56.710
 the seasoning of hard cheese 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.170
 opened a magic jar with such 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.720
 points you can see here like this 

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:04.090
 you can pour it through such holes 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.790
 This jar of salt sold under here
