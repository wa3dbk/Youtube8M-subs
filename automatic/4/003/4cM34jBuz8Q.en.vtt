00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330 
often do you get a chance to to

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.290 
often do you get a chance to to
transform<00:00:30.170> a<00:00:30.260> museum<00:00:31.029> doesn't<00:00:32.029> happen<00:00:32.120> very

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:39.780 
transform a museum doesn't happen very
often<00:00:32.660> so<00:00:33.110> that<00:00:33.500> was<00:00:33.650> a<00:00:33.680> very<00:00:33.920> tempting<00:00:34.400> offer

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:39.790 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.689 

University<00:00:40.790> is<00:00:41.000> in<00:00:41.210> a<00:00:41.300> way<00:00:41.449> special<00:00:42.190> in<00:00:43.190> that

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:43.699 
University is in a way special in that

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:46.390 
University is in a way special in that
respect<00:00:44.210> that<00:00:44.420> is<00:00:44.600> it<00:00:44.900> is<00:00:45.080> all<00:00:45.350> about<00:00:45.400> thinking

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:46.400 
respect that is it is all about thinking

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:54.040 
respect that is it is all about thinking
I<00:00:49.690> see<00:00:50.690> myself<00:00:50.870> as<00:00:51.430> as<00:00:52.430> a<00:00:53.120> builder<00:00:53.659> of<00:00:53.690> things

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
I see myself as as a builder of things

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.950 
I see myself as as a builder of things
so<00:00:55.040> it<00:00:55.489> it<00:00:55.760> was<00:00:55.940> maybe<00:00:56.269> particularly<00:00:56.659> at<00:00:56.870> the

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
so it it was maybe particularly at the

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.229 
so it it was maybe particularly at the
beginning<00:00:57.350> here<00:00:57.739> a<00:00:58.070> bit<00:00:58.370> frustrating<00:00:58.970> to<00:00:59.089> see

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
beginning here a bit frustrating to see

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:00.719 
beginning here a bit frustrating to see
how<00:00:59.360> long<00:00:59.510> it<00:00:59.690> takes<00:00:59.900> to<00:01:00.019> get<00:01:00.260> things<00:01:00.500> moving

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:00.729 
how long it takes to get things moving

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:04.240 
how long it takes to get things moving
because<00:01:01.989> everybody<00:01:02.989> has<00:01:03.260> to<00:01:03.379> be<00:01:03.500> in<00:01:03.620> but<00:01:04.040> then

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
because everybody has to be in but then

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.110 
because everybody has to be in but then
once<00:01:04.549> everybody<00:01:05.479> is<00:01:05.659> him<00:01:06.610> nobody<00:01:07.610> can<00:01:07.700> stop

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:08.120 
once everybody is him nobody can stop

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.960 
once everybody is him nobody can stop
that<00:01:08.330> train

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
to have been a bit of a search for

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.100 
to have been a bit of a search for
finding<00:01:20.920> that<00:01:21.430> space<00:01:21.910> where<00:01:22.330> I<00:01:22.360> could<00:01:22.900> feel

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
finding that space where I could feel

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.520 
finding that space where I could feel
comfortable<00:01:23.950> doing<00:01:24.130> what<00:01:24.610> I<00:01:24.870> want<00:01:25.870> to<00:01:26.080> do<00:01:26.230> all
