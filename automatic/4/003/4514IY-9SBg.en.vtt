passes<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.399> Harkins<00:01:56.759> so<00:01:56.849> I<00:01:56.909> figured<00:01:57.179> was<00:01:57.270> just

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:57.419 
passes to Harkins so I figured was just

00:01:57.419 --> 00:01:58.699 
passes to Harkins so I figured was just
a<00:01:57.450> good<00:01:57.569> opportunity<00:01:57.749> to<00:01:57.989> use<00:01:58.169> them<00:01:58.319> since<00:01:58.619> we

00:01:58.699 --> 00:01:58.709 
a good opportunity to use them since we

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:01.159 
a good opportunity to use them since we
don't<00:01:58.770> ever<00:01:58.919> come<00:01:59.099> to<00:01:59.189> Harkins<00:01:59.520> very<00:01:59.729> often<00:02:00.169> so

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:01.169 
don't ever come to Harkins very often so

00:02:01.169 --> 00:02:02.539 
don't ever come to Harkins very often so
