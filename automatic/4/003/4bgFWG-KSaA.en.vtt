point<00:04:47.010> on<00:04:47.240> last<00:04:48.240> point<00:04:48.480> I<00:04:48.510> guess<00:04:48.720> would<00:04:48.930> be<00:04:48.960> a

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
point on last point I guess would be a

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.990 
point on last point I guess would be a
choice<00:04:49.260> vex<00:04:49.560> Latios<00:04:49.980> Draco<00:04:50.310> meteor<00:04:50.460> versus

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
choice vex Latios Draco meteor versus

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.300 
choice vex Latios Draco meteor versus
the<00:04:51.210> Blastoise<00:04:51.630> spread<00:04:51.900> would<00:04:52.590> be<00:04:52.770> a<00:04:53.010> fifty

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
the Blastoise spread would be a fifty

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.010 
the Blastoise spread would be a fifty
three<00:04:53.460> point<00:04:53.610> one<00:04:53.820> chance<00:04:54.030> of<00:04:54.180> to<00:04:54.270> it<00:04:54.390> kills<00:04:54.660> so

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
three point one chance of to it kills so

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.450 
three point one chance of to it kills so
you<00:04:55.080> definitely<00:04:55.410> have<00:04:55.650> you<00:04:55.890> have<00:04:55.980> a<00:04:56.040> chance<00:04:56.280> to

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
you definitely have you have a chance to

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.410 
you definitely have you have a chance to
get<00:04:56.580> three<00:04:56.910> ik<00:04:57.000> it<00:04:57.240> as<00:04:57.480> so<00:04:58.230> yeah<00:04:59.120> so<00:05:00.120> like<00:05:00.270> I

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:00.420 
get three ik it as so yeah so like I

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:01.670 
get three ik it as so yeah so like I
said<00:05:00.480> this<00:05:00.780> gets<00:05:00.960> paired<00:05:01.170> up<00:05:01.290> very<00:05:01.470> nicely

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
said this gets paired up very nicely

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.320 
said this gets paired up very nicely
from<00:05:01.950> your<00:05:02.100> code<00:05:02.250> because<00:05:02.520> being<00:05:02.820> able<00:05:02.940> then

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
from your code because being able then

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.210 
from your code because being able then
take<00:05:03.540> these<00:05:03.720> hits<00:05:03.900> a<00:05:04.080> little<00:05:04.440> bit<00:05:04.560> not<00:05:04.800> so<00:05:04.830> well

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
take these hits a little bit not so well

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.040 
take these hits a little bit not so well
is<00:05:05.460> good<00:05:05.730> because<00:05:05.970> you<00:05:06.360> can<00:05:06.540> come<00:05:06.660> in<00:05:06.780> on<00:05:06.840> this

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
is good because you can come in on this

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.410 
is good because you can come in on this
they<00:05:07.350> don't<00:05:07.440> expect<00:05:07.830> you<00:05:08.040> to<00:05:08.190> take<00:05:08.310> bid<00:05:08.520> any

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:09.420 
they don't expect you to take bid any

make sure to go check out the paceman
for<00:05:13.470> some<00:05:13.590> other<00:05:13.740> coughs<00:05:14.040> I<00:05:14.400> left<00:05:15.150> some<00:05:15.330> other

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:15.480 
for some other coughs I left some other

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.870 
for some other coughs I left some other
decent<00:05:15.720> ones<00:05:16.050> in<00:05:16.200> there<00:05:16.350> too<00:05:16.620> so<00:05:17.190> yeah<00:05:17.850> I

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
decent ones in there too so yeah I

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:18.800 
decent ones in there too so yeah I
definitely<00:05:17.970> make<00:05:18.300> sure<00:05:18.330> to<00:05:18.480> check<00:05:18.600> that<00:05:18.660> out

definitely make sure to check that out

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.750 
definitely make sure to check that out
if<00:05:18.930> you're<00:05:19.080> into<00:05:19.320> a<00:05:19.350> whole<00:05:19.470> calcs<00:05:20.010> and<00:05:20.280> stuff

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:20.760 
if you're into a whole calcs and stuff

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.390 
if you're into a whole calcs and stuff
so<00:05:21.270> yeah<00:05:22.200> some<00:05:22.500> good<00:05:22.650> teammates<00:05:23.040> I<00:05:23.190> guess

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
so yeah some good teammates I guess

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.720 
so yeah some good teammates I guess
would<00:05:23.700> be<00:05:23.760> stuff<00:05:24.330> like<00:05:24.630> stuff<00:05:25.610> hazards<00:05:26.610> are

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:26.730 
would be stuff like stuff hazards are

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:28.160 
would be stuff like stuff hazards are
another<00:05:26.970> good<00:05:27.150> thing<00:05:27.180> because<00:05:27.660> your<00:05:27.780> ice<00:05:27.930> beam

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:28.170 
another good thing because your ice beam

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:30.530 
another good thing because your ice beam
does<00:05:28.380> not<00:05:28.530> always<00:05:28.890> okö<00:05:29.220> because<00:05:29.580> you<00:05:29.970> have<00:05:30.240> no

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:30.540 
does not always okö because you have no

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.930 
does not always okö because you have no
special<00:05:30.780> attack<00:05:31.110> investment<00:05:31.710> so<00:05:32.520> rocks

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
special attack investment so rocks

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.070 
special attack investment so rocks
spikes<00:05:33.480> the<00:05:33.960> works<00:05:34.640> it<00:05:35.640> may<00:05:36.030> be<00:05:36.090> an<00:05:36.240> extra

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
spikes the works it may be an extra

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.360 
spikes the works it may be an extra
spinner<00:05:37.380> in<00:05:37.590> case<00:05:37.770> you<00:05:37.920> need<00:05:38.070> to<00:05:38.100> use<00:05:38.190> more

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370 
spinner in case you need to use more

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.190 
spinner in case you need to use more
than<00:05:38.670> mere<00:05:38.940> coat<00:05:39.180> than<00:05:39.360> the<00:05:39.420> rapid<00:05:39.750> spin<00:05:39.960> I'd

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:40.200 
than mere coat than the rapid spin I'd

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.720 
than mere coat than the rapid spin I'd
say<00:05:40.380> like<00:05:40.500> fortress<00:05:41.010> if<00:05:41.190> you<00:05:41.310> want<00:05:41.490> for<00:05:41.610> you

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:41.730 
say like fortress if you want for you

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:43.610 
say like fortress if you want for you
you<00:05:41.900> fortress<00:05:42.900> should<00:05:43.050> definitely<00:05:43.380> be<00:05:43.440> nice

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 
you fortress should definitely be nice

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:44.900 
you fortress should definitely be nice
as<00:05:43.800> you<00:05:43.920> can<00:05:43.950> switch<00:05:44.250> in<00:05:44.370> on<00:05:44.490> the<00:05:44.580> fire<00:05:44.730> type

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:44.910 
as you can switch in on the fire type

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:48.350 
as you can switch in on the fire type
attacks<00:05:45.270> it<00:05:45.450> does<00:05:45.600> not<00:05:45.810> want<00:05:46.050> to<00:05:46.140> take<00:05:46.550> so<00:05:47.550> yeah

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 
attacks it does not want to take so yeah

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.760 
attacks it does not want to take so yeah
I'm<00:05:48.570> definitely<00:05:48.690> trying<00:05:49.140> to<00:05:49.200> think<00:05:49.470> just

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.770 
I'm definitely trying to think just

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.230 
I'm definitely trying to think just
stuff<00:05:50.040> that<00:05:50.070> definitely<00:05:50.700> carry<00:05:50.910> some<00:05:51.060> good

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 
stuff that definitely carry some good

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.880 
stuff that definitely carry some good
synergy<00:05:51.690> with<00:05:51.840> it<00:05:51.960> stuff<00:05:52.200> you<00:05:52.290> can<00:05:52.440> switch<00:05:52.710> in

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:52.890 
synergy with it stuff you can switch in

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:54.590 
synergy with it stuff you can switch in
and<00:05:53.040> out<00:05:53.130> of<00:05:53.370> well<00:05:54.030> I<00:05:54.060> know<00:05:54.240> that's<00:05:54.480> basically

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:54.600 
and out of well I know that's basically

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.750 
and out of well I know that's basically
the<00:05:54.990> same<00:05:55.169> thing<00:05:55.230> for<00:05:55.590> any<00:05:55.680> team<00:05:55.980> but<00:05:56.220> yeah

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:56.760 
the same thing for any team but yeah

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.210 
the same thing for any team but yeah
that<00:05:56.940> sums<00:05:57.150> up<00:05:57.330> about<00:05:57.750> right<00:05:57.810> so<00:05:58.620> yeah<00:05:59.040> I<00:05:59.070> make

00:05:59.210 --> 00:05:59.220 
that sums up about right so yeah I make

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:00.350 
that sums up about right so yeah I make
sure<00:05:59.340> we<00:05:59.430> be<00:05:59.520> like<00:05:59.640> if<00:05:59.790> you<00:05:59.880> enjoyed<00:06:00.150> this
