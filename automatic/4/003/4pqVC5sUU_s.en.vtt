00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.910
 hello everyone we are on the 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.680
 01net techno chain to take a shot 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:11.389
 with xavier regord on a 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.389
 wireless speaker worth a visit 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.970
 know you had lots then this 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.020
 pregnant philips model fidelio all 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.859
 first in a few words his 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.050
 specificities 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.489
 well, it's the little sister of a 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.689
 model that we had tested a few 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:33.329
 weeks the a5 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.489
 this time it's the a3 it's 100 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.140
 euros less and its specificities 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.949
 to run wirelessly that's it 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.879
 convenient 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:39.930
 in what way because we know he 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.839
 are several wireless systems 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.940
 today, that's the end of the day 

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:46.589
 particularity of being neither bluetooth nor 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.659
 called but to function only at 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:50.369
 somewhat proprietary system that gets 

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:52.379
 connects to wifi a bit as the called 

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:53.190
 a network that already exists is what these 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.989
 direct wi fi 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.430
 no it's not direct wifi it's 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.699
 a normal girl is wifi philips 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.290
 wifi philips okay ok and that 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.000
 works with what types of sources 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.019
 for rest since it's done for 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.820
 listen to music obviously 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.979
 well it works as well as 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.600
 pc software that we download or with 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.220
 an android application or ios 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.570
 so if we do not have which smartphone or 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.520
 tablet then xavier the highlights 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.290
 of this wireless speaker is the 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.869
 main strength is the quality the 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.829
 audio quality which is pretty terrible this 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.179
 which is pretty good for a speaker 

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:27.479
 very good very good other good ones 

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:30.299
 basics of good acute impeccable by 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.829
 compared to other models on it is 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.439
 What the norm rather above 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.789
 rather below rather rather rather 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.119
 on top we do not go down too low in 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:38.369
 serious 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.200
 saw what it takes good and seen a good 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.829
 balance very well a good report 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.109
 price quality 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.109
 not bad also echoes target 100 euros 

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:48.210
 less than his big sister 250 euros 

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:50.789
 so it's not bad maybe a little 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.069
 expensive yet also reasonable ok a 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:54.899
 another strong point another point 

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:56.429
 interesting is the five buttons that 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.929
 are there that can be configured in 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:00.749
 the application and that gives direct access 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:03.359
 to some webradio so change a little 

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:07.189
 radio music directly on the speaker 

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:07.189
 no need to iron through the application 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.030
 weak points on this speaker 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.530
 fidelio and well a main point 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.750
 low so this is the application offered 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.520
 in question as does not go through 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.260
 airplay protocol does not go through 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.710
 itunes we go through an application 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.470
 philippe house 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:25.240
 and she's pretty uncomfortable is a 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.440
 little unstable plants from time to time 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.770
 there are slowdowns do not know too much 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.810
 Why 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.680
 that's the main weak point and 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:31.210
 it's a shame because we are 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.440
 obliged to go through the pure application 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.970
 playing music is a little embarrassing 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.440
 is there access to all 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.630
 known music sources services 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.830
 online music etc 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.450
 the application of the excess whose 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.940
 music library is stored on the 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:46.600
 tablet to the internet and we have access 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:48.430
 also to deezer and spotify but that's it 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.290
 it's limited to that so the day we want 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.540
 use a game watch the videos on 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.140
 youtube or use another service from 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.870
 music online 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.230
 it can not be very bad thank you 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.940
 xavier 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.500
 this is for this look at this 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.880
 small wireless speaker fidelio 2 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.230
 philippe if we will find you the 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.120
 know all week long with 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.120
 tests from scratch to nabeul hi to all
