you<00:02:09.819> know<00:02:10.149> I'm<00:02:10.270> strong<00:02:10.630> and<00:02:11.050> I<00:02:11.110> wouldn't<00:02:11.319> I

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
you know I'm strong and I wouldn't I

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:23.000 
you know I'm strong and I wouldn't I
wouldn't<00:02:11.620> have<00:02:11.770> anything<00:02:11.950> that<00:02:12.730> would<00:02:12.819> be

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.500 

how<00:02:24.010> did<00:02:24.220> music<00:02:24.610> influence<00:02:25.330> your<00:02:25.480> writing

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
how did music influence your writing

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.140 
how did music influence your writing
it's<00:02:26.470> definitely<00:02:26.860> and<00:02:27.040> how<00:02:27.220> would<00:02:27.460> the<00:02:27.940> books

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
it's definitely and how would the books

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.380 
it's definitely and how would the books
be<00:02:28.300> different<00:02:28.630> without<00:02:28.720> it<00:02:29.430> well<00:02:30.430> you<00:02:31.270> know

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
be different without it well you know

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.420 
be different without it well you know
the<00:02:31.480> music<00:02:31.660> is<00:02:31.840> always<00:02:32.170> really<00:02:32.980> important<00:02:33.400> I

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
the music is always really important I

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.380 
the music is always really important I
think<00:02:33.490> maybe<00:02:33.700> the<00:02:33.850> books<00:02:34.000> would<00:02:34.060> be<00:02:34.120> different

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
think maybe the books would be different

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:35.970 
think maybe the books would be different
in<00:02:34.450> that<00:02:34.540> they<00:02:34.630> wouldn't<00:02:34.840> be<00:02:34.900> written<00:02:35.200> if<00:02:35.710> I

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
in that they wouldn't be written if I

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.530 
in that they wouldn't be written if I
didn't<00:02:36.310> have<00:02:36.430> music<00:02:36.520> to<00:02:36.940> keep<00:02:37.090> me<00:02:37.240> going

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
didn't have music to keep me going

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.570 
didn't have music to keep me going
I<00:02:37.660> can't<00:02:37.840> concentrate<00:02:38.050> unless<00:02:38.740> I've<00:02:39.520> got

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
I can't concentrate unless I've got

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.670 
I can't concentrate unless I've got
something<00:02:40.210> really<00:02:40.750> loud<00:02:41.050> in<00:02:41.200> the<00:02:41.290> background

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
something really loud in the background

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.610 
something really loud in the background
and<00:02:41.980> I<00:02:42.310> do<00:02:42.370> think<00:02:42.730> that<00:02:42.790> some<00:02:43.450> of<00:02:43.480> the<00:02:43.810> emotions

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
and I do think that some of the emotions

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:45.720 
and I do think that some of the emotions
in<00:02:44.740> the<00:02:44.800> book<00:02:44.950> would<00:02:45.070> be<00:02:45.100> different<00:02:45.520> if<00:02:45.640> I

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
in the book would be different if I

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.790 
in the book would be different if I
wasn't<00:02:45.910> feeling<00:02:46.690> them<00:02:47.050> because<00:02:47.470> I'm

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
wasn't feeling them because I'm

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.050 
wasn't feeling them because I'm
listening<00:02:48.100> to<00:02:48.190> Marjorie<00:02:48.520> fair<00:02:48.700> and<00:02:48.820> I<00:02:48.850> want<00:02:49.000> to

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
listening to Marjorie fair and I want to

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.250 
listening to Marjorie fair and I want to
shoot<00:02:49.210> myself<00:02:49.270> and<00:02:49.870> some<00:02:49.990> people<00:02:50.170> would

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
shoot myself and some people would

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.990 
shoot myself and some people would
translate<00:02:50.650> that<00:02:50.920> into<00:02:51.130> somebody<00:02:51.520> else's<00:02:51.760> pain

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
translate that into somebody else's pain

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.960 
translate that into somebody else's pain
and<00:02:52.440> you<00:02:53.440> know<00:02:53.560> or<00:02:53.710> Linkin<00:02:54.220> Park<00:02:54.460> and<00:02:54.610> I<00:02:54.700> can

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
and you know or Linkin Park and I can

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.730 
and you know or Linkin Park and I can
get<00:02:55.090> the<00:02:55.420> feeling<00:02:55.900> right<00:02:56.020> for<00:02:56.200> the<00:02:56.290> action<00:02:56.680> and

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740 
get the feeling right for the action and

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.290 
get the feeling right for the action and
get<00:02:56.890> the<00:02:56.980> painting<00:02:57.340> right<00:02:57.460> so<00:02:57.700> there<00:02:58.120> wouldn't

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
get the painting right so there wouldn't

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.090 
get the painting right so there wouldn't
be<00:02:58.330> books<00:02:58.570> without<00:02:58.720> music<00:02:59.110> that's<00:02:59.860> how<00:03:00.010> they'd

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
be books without music that's how they'd

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.800 
be books without music that's how they'd
be<00:03:00.130> different

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810
