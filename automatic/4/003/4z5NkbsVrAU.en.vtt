00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
silver metallic ink is because it

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:52.890 
silver metallic ink is because it

sometimes you just get a faint little
sparkly<00:02:55.480> impression<00:02:56.440> but<00:02:56.650> this<00:02:57.100> time<00:02:57.400> and

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
sparkly impression but this time and

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:00.030 
sparkly impression but this time and
then<00:02:58.600> get<00:02:58.810> enough<00:02:59.109> coming<00:02:59.500> through<00:02:59.680> so<00:02:59.859> what

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
then get enough coming through so what

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.490 
then get enough coming through so what
you<00:03:00.160> can<00:03:00.370> do<00:03:00.549> is<00:03:00.880> since<00:03:01.630> this<00:03:01.900> is<00:03:02.109> sucked<00:03:02.380> out

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
you can do is since this is sucked out

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.339 
you can do is since this is sucked out
of<00:03:02.560> a<00:03:02.709> sticky<00:03:03.040> you<00:03:03.130> can<00:03:03.280> screen<00:03:03.609> twice<00:03:04.000> and<00:03:04.690> get

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:21.549 
to do is take it and lay it out until

00:05:21.549 --> 00:05:23.879 
to do is take it and lay it out until
all<00:05:21.610> of<00:05:21.819> that<00:05:22.299> you<00:05:22.539> do<00:05:22.719> ink<00:05:22.989> is<00:05:23.199> dry<00:05:23.499> and<00:05:23.739> even

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:23.889

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:26.229 
though it's probably dry already it's a

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:29.069 
though it's probably dry already it's a
good<00:05:26.379> idea<00:05:26.709> just<00:05:27.099> to<00:05:27.329> set<00:05:28.329> this<00:05:28.479> out<00:05:28.689> flat<00:05:29.049> and

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:29.079 
good idea just to set this out flat and

00:05:29.079 --> 00:05:31.949 
good idea just to set this out flat and
take<00:05:29.469> a<00:05:29.499> good<00:05:29.709> look<00:05:29.919> at<00:05:30.129> it<00:05:30.159> as<00:05:30.399> well<00:05:30.699> and<00:05:31.029> seed

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:31.959 
take a good look at it as well and seed

00:05:31.959 --> 00:05:33.419 
take a good look at it as well and seed
are<00:05:32.199> there<00:05:32.319> enough<00:05:32.439> snowflakes<00:05:33.069> are<00:05:33.309> you
