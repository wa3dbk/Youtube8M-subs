00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:53.900 
foundation brush so I'm working with the

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.050 
foundation brush so I'm working with the
liquid<00:00:54.260> foundation<00:00:54.490> and<00:00:55.490> we're<00:00:55.640> working<00:00:55.790> from

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:56.060 
liquid foundation and we're working from

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:02.590 
liquid foundation and we're working from
the<00:00:56.210> center<00:00:56.540> of<00:00:56.600> the<00:00:56.750> face<00:00:56.930> outwards<00:01:01.450> this<00:01:02.450> is

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
the center of the face outwards this is

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.669 
the center of the face outwards this is
a<00:01:02.630> very<00:01:02.990> light<00:01:03.230> foundation<00:01:03.970> because<00:01:05.439> my<00:01:06.439> skin

00:01:06.669 --> 00:01:06.679 
a very light foundation because my skin

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:08.020 
a very light foundation because my skin
is<00:01:06.740> pretty<00:01:06.770> good<00:01:07.070> at<00:01:07.189> the<00:01:07.250> moment<00:01:07.280> and<00:01:07.729> I<00:01:07.789> don't

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
is pretty good at the moment and I don't

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.090 
is pretty good at the moment and I don't
need<00:01:08.270> a<00:01:08.299> lot<00:01:08.509> of<00:01:08.570> coverage<00:01:08.899> and<00:01:09.170> I<00:01:09.679> think<00:01:09.710> that

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
need a lot of coverage and I think that

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.370 
need a lot of coverage and I think that
if<00:01:10.189> you<00:01:10.280> don't<00:01:10.490> need<00:01:10.820> a<00:01:10.850> lot<00:01:11.119> of<00:01:11.149> coverage<00:01:11.380> they

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
if you don't need a lot of coverage they

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.300 
if you don't need a lot of coverage they
might<00:01:12.619> put<00:01:12.799> it<00:01:12.890> on<00:01:14.679> so<00:01:15.679> it's<00:01:15.799> a<00:01:15.859> great<00:01:16.159> little

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
might put it on so it's a great little

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.739 
might put it on so it's a great little
brush<00:01:16.609> which<00:01:16.789> is<00:01:16.880> getting<00:01:17.179> around<00:01:17.450> the<00:01:17.570> nose

00:01:17.739 --> 00:01:17.749 
brush which is getting around the nose

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:27.510 
brush which is getting around the nose
and<00:01:18.109> under<00:01:18.799> the<00:01:18.920> eyes

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.310 

so<00:01:28.060> we're<00:01:28.150> working<00:01:28.299> outwards<00:01:28.840> towards<00:01:29.020> the

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
so we're working outwards towards the

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.929 
so we're working outwards towards the
jaw

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:37.559 

and<00:01:35.539> the<00:01:35.659> quicker<00:01:35.899> you<00:01:36.109> work<00:01:36.320> the<00:01:36.560> better

00:01:37.559 --> 00:01:37.569 
and the quicker you work the better

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:39.910 
and the quicker you work the better
because<00:01:38.569> depending<00:01:38.869> on<00:01:39.109> the<00:01:39.229> foundation<00:01:39.799> you

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
because depending on the foundation you

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.139 
because depending on the foundation you
use<00:01:40.130> some<00:01:40.399> of<00:01:40.429> them<00:01:40.670> set<00:01:41.030> so<00:01:42.969> you'll<00:01:43.969> get<00:01:44.119> a

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
use some of them set so you'll get a

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:49.120 
use some of them set so you'll get a
better<00:01:44.390> finish<00:01:44.840> if<00:01:45.109> you<00:01:45.530> work<00:01:45.740> quickly<00:01:48.130> moving

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
better finish if you work quickly moving

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.770 
better finish if you work quickly moving
