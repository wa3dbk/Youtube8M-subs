00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:08.880
 hello everyone welcome on kitchen 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.260
 quick 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.040
 today we are going to make some 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.990
 Originally chocolate chips for our 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.490
 chips we will need white chocolate 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.490
 and dark chocolate 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.410
 so we'll need a bain-marie 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.930
 so does his two pans with 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.689
 the hot water in which I am going 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.390
 put another container 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:34.559
 we will start with white chocolate 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.840
 then the idea is to get it back 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:41.129
 gently so as not to burn it 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.329
 so I'm going to mix with the spatula of 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.460
 from time to time it will go very quickly 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.879
 it is once he will be reappointed I 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.820
 will remove it so my white chocolate 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.890
 has melted you must not heat it too much 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.949
 otherwise he'll go to cook and it'll go 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.949
 in small grains so in parallel 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:02.160
 so I prepared a plate that I 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.409
 slightly humidified and smoking so I 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.670
 will now be able to put my 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.900
 white chocolate had to go over 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.689
 and I would put it hip not say 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.049
 to form so but chips of 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.049
 White chocolate 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.119
 the idea is to spread it over 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.119
 the surface 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.090
 that's it, but it's actually 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.579
 preparation wants to keep it at 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.750
 freezer in the fridge and will use it 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:35.079
 really when we need it 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:38.110
 it's super practical a real with the 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:41.409
 white horse if you want to have fun 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:44.079
 to have small reliefs what you 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:45.850
 can do is put a little bit 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:49.530
 of dye or during the phrase round 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:54.670
 you left it's everywhere 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:57.219
 once you've done it 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:03.429
 just give two three little shots 

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:04.229
 here and then we will film this 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:08.729
 preparation 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.729
 so here is put directly in the fridge 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:21.160
 we will go dark chocolate so here I 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:25.389
 put a container on my water bath and 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.680
 I poured all in chocolate and I 

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:28.889
 will get it to melt too 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.420
 quietly 

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:33.810
 that's it until it's completely 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.810
 liquid 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.800
 my chocolate has melted well I will 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:44.110
 able to put it on the plate that I have 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.110
 also humidified heavy may 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:51.470
 do not hesitate to put grains of 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:54.720
 pistachios roasted almonds 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.690
 Broken speculoos really do not hesitate 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.080
 not to have fun with with his chips 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.030
 of chocolate 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.030
 so we'll install it pretty thinly 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:11.760
 we do not get good shine the 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.810
 Then I will reserve the same 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.820
 fate that white chocolate 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:19.910
 I will get up and put it to the 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:23.989
 freezer 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:30.209
 my chocolate plate has cooled well 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:31.800
 so I take off the film and here it is 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:35.280
 we can break pieces and 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:37.920
 breaks and so on verrines or so 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.480
 on cakes in decoration it can 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.320
 to be nice 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.489
 So here are chocolate shavings 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.489
 easy to make 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:48.720
 now I show you chocolate 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:51.870
 black did not play half so at 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.610
 freezer in ten minutes it lasts so 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:55.560
 so you break small pieces 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.260
 like that and wanted to crash so 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:01.080
 directly into a verrine of a 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:04.620
 cake or I think you do not have 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.230
 lacked imagination to use your 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.820
 Chocolate chips 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.160
 I was delighted to have introduced you to my 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.970
 chocolate coconut recipe 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.769
 I hope you will be able to 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:17.060
 reproduce at home I tell you to 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:17.060
