00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.980
 there is a herb that is daisies 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.050
 remembered and since the Greek 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.170
 ancient used in many diseases 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.170
 becomes 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.150
 This plant is called tanaka for party never 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.340
 um or mother herb it will 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:37.510
 traditionally against migraine headaches 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.980
 but also used again there 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.050
 several clinical studies on it 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.210
 not just hint that mother herb 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.030
 but also in their migraine 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.160
 early stages help one uses the 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.170
 leaves of the plant possibly 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.820
 they are eaten as bread and it is 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:58.780
 suffice two or three leaves per 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:01:01.449
 day have a really bitter 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.940
 they are a taste for many people 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:06.100
 therefore difficult to swallow 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.810
 especially for sweetmouths like me that 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:12.060
 taste is a zwischending gin 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.060
 tonic and cat litter 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.800
 mother herb does not taste good 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.800
 but migraine in front 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.820
 mother herb contains patino song that 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.979
 anti-inflammatory effect 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.190
 Migraine dilates the blood vessels thereby 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:34.659
 the strong headaches arise 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:38.040
 martinoli tbyte this extension 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.040
 and thus also the migraine 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.900
 the active ingredients of the mother's cross are 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.850
 pretty strong and can be too light 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:50.979
 stomach upset or at 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:53.510
 abrupt heels to hurt 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:56.320
 I will leaf from the mother herb 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:58.820
 establish a herb butter 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.410
 You have to have the leaves every day 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.270
 take with them the 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:05.990
 full anti-inflammatory properties 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:09.490
 to come into effect and as part of one 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:12.080
 Herb butter works fine 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.120
 I make enough butter for a week 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:18.650
 So seven cans that is about 20 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:20.570
 leaves i hide the bitter 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:25.580
 taste of the mother cross with tarragon 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:27.680
 and parsley g2 finely chopped 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.160
 teaspoonful and a big one 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.840
 teaspoon of lemon peel 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:36.830
 I also take ground ginger 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:39.310
 that already in WÃ¶rth traditionally against 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.420

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.170

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:56.480
 herb does not notice this sweet 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.100
 fragrant herbal mixture obscures the 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.100
 bitter aftertaste the mother cross 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:09.740
 it smells wonderful 40 and after herbs 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.920
 work 100 grams of soft butter 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:15.170
 Herb butter is really 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.840
 versatile you can do it too 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:21.220
 to steak potatoes to them 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:25.840
 One is two to three leaves per day 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.840
 You will discover many possibilities 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.510
 Use mother herb only if you 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.970
 over 18 and not pregnant or 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.440
 Breastfeeding if you need other medicines 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.750
 Take a word with her before 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.640
 doctor 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:45.440
 You have to eat the herb every day with it 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:47.090
 plant the effect fully unfolded 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.160
 Remedies can be just as strong 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.590
 the conventional medicine and should 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.570
 Be treated with respect when you 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.860

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:58.940
 You should mother herb however 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:06.350
 Avoid and come to an end 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:08.390
 butter in parchment paper is sure 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.580
 a more elegant way to add the butter 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.110
 serve 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:17.239
 I'm afraid my is not very 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:19.460
 cultivated the butter does not like it 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:25.250
 stars look suspicious but you 

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:27.110

 whether that tastes delicious that mother herb 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:47.240
 gets completely from the lemon and ginger 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:50.800
 covers and at the same time helps 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.800
 butter against migraine class
