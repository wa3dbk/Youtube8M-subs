00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.550
 and I'll call you the book droz 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.769
 has marked 

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:11.730
 that the book has marked me good to see 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:11.730
 There are many 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.350
 I think the books that have marked me 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.820
 they're my favorites 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:25.200
 because I loved history 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:28.320
 I loved them as a novel 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.750
 the talisman of stephen king peter straub 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.710
 write down 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:35.590
 has one of the best villains that I 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.470
 I have read in my life 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:41.080
 Look, it's a fantasy book , but it's 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.630
 much more realistic is called morgan 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:46.030
 At least I read it more than 10 years ago 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:48.660
 13 years ago I read the book and I still 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.800
 agreement of the name of the villain 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:56.579
 with reading three pages of how is the guy 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:58.050
 Voldemort looks like a childish villain of 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.960
 fact 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.390
 Under the talisman of Stephen King Peter 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.729
 straus 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.040
 what else so I have marked that is 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.550
 good do a book that instilled a lot 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.520
 the taste for horror is precisely 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:17.729
 worth the redundancy here live the horror 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:21.900
 of yay ansón here lives the horror is a 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:24.210
 book about amibil here lives the horror 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.210
 it's a book that makes you look as if 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.180
 what happened in aviles is true or not but 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.140
 is to shit the book scares you 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.140
 book scares you 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:39.380
 I really liked the books of 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.650
 hercules poirot de agatha christie a la 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.240
 author to agatha christie grande del 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.580
 best literature detective 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.310
 hercules poirot 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:52.160
 from stephen king going back to quote him 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.200
 love do it that the clown 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.510
 pennywise a million times better than the 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.000
 movie of the miniseries sorry the 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:03.020
 miniseries I do not explain a fuck 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.440
 the book is great the glow also 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.280
 the king 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.280
 or the other 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:18.790
 there are several and there are many 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.790
 they fascinated me, they fascinated me 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.290
 and the lord of the rings' I liked it but 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.460
 my favorite work of talking is the 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.730
 silmarillion 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.190
 the silmarillion the other lazy books 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.220
 plus 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.520
 they forged me in the humorist that I am the 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.560
 clown that I am today 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.120

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.390

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.739
 program in this 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.330

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.780

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.910
 who still believes in those blowjobs but 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.130
 in fact there is almost no talk about it 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.230
 because it is known that they are stupidities like 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.250
 the immense are many stupidities 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.750
 most other theories 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.280
 conspiratorial that some people 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.590
 they want to have because they are extremely 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.700
 boring 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.700

 football is not for nothing 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:38.600
 he never gets the taste and the truth is 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:41.380

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.820
