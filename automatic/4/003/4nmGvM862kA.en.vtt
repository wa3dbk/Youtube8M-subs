00:00:00.629 --> 00:00:05.340
 this is the halo valkenswaard smart quarter that is specially made for the 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.680
 children and he has had many different functions 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:11.839
 of course all look forward to 

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:15.720
 First of all, looking is to give what the others get as standard 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.670
 two shooting incident available in different variants I have you one 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:20.289
 black and a pink variant 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.789
 You can see which variants are available on our website 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.390
 in addition, of course, one that course week already included to get it on 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.110
 load or I am having fun with the computer 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.270
 that you can transfer files first 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.870
 and you also get a headset included with a micro usb 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:35.980
 connection 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.379
 but that headset year 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:40.010
 as the name suggests they are just listening to music 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.150
 also has a call 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.830
 Finally, m will of course also receive names once again 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.159
 operate the device yourself 

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:49.659
 Also have a stylist included that it is easier to 

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:53.149
 control that small screen food and make that choice easily on your phone 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:55.730
 click the middle of the still millimeter board 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.089
 or you just keep one loose 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:00:59.639
 and then you can just use it as loose 

00:00:59.639 --> 00:01:02.199
 and later take a look at the device itself 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:05.670
 and we see that the devices are made entirely of rubber with a hard one 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.140
 plastic yes housing actually and this feels very much 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.850
 the solid at the workplace meant for children they can also just order 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.329
 hold the arm when a dog is busy in the playground 

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:18.160
 and what he can in itself withstand them 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.930
 but for the rest there is also a rubber band around one 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.960
 and yes, that color, of course, that debt 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.030
 on the basis of which version the strap is too small to be for me 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.020
 wrist to participate 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.740
 but to give a picture of how big the device is as a consultant 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.609
 wrist keeps you see that in my adult wrist is still a reasonable 

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:35.789
 large unit 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:38.719
 it is not and a small device that also just on there 

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:42.349
 and with children it will of course be just a little something big 

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:44.770
 For years it has been a very pastor in itself 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:45.640
 after 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.140
 look at the back here the battery is removed 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.310
 and here you see the inside of the device 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.280
 the inside and actually two things young becomes standard and the two 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.560
 of the bite memory card manufacturer 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.720
 but also preview all photos and save videos or music she wants too 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:59.850
 look at his toes 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.289
 m the holes just a non-smokers map 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:06.959
 and with a part of the microsim card they can also call the problems 

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:08.920
 Well let's take a look at this one 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.989
 other version is the black version and it is in tibet 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:13.449
 the language in the thick 

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:16.919
 on the other hand, only the batteries that are placed in it now also find them 

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:19.450
 acts as a single battery flap 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.540
 please note that the slide eyelove or decision 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.060
 that it is not the watertight 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.020
 so he can absolutely not under water or he is also something 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.749
 waterproof 

00:02:28.749 --> 00:02:30.950
 so training needs to take place there 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.070
 at the top of devices and find the speaker and microphone 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.720
 we also immediately find the small camera that is built-in 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.860
 and on the right side actually find all the ways in which one 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:41.640
 can operate 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.459
 and that you namely still the on and off button 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.069
 and find the back button 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.959
 m in between find the knee is back when port members can charge device or 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.999
 synchronization sooner than him than just turned on by the knock you on 

00:02:52.999 --> 00:02:54.259
 the side 

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:58.359
 then the bluebird first seemed to pay attention to the stock market standard screen 

00:02:58.359 --> 00:02:59.470
 the date with time 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.310
 how this screen looks like they can adjust, you just do it 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.220
 to click in the middle of the screen 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:05.629
 and see you then 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:08.739
 yes when you see the debt parties you can set up 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.299
 yeah so i can walk there a little earlier and or your own 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.059
 son or daughter can do that ourselves 

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:17.959
 thousands of angry customers then you go to the main menu and the main menu 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.109
 diving a few things first of all see above how high the battery is 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:22.349
 charged 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:26.830
 and what can be achieved and at the bottom, and immediately two options have a call button 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:31.600
 Jamie Bell between the preacher is also right on the contact list 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.499
 and if you want to call something type that number one and press call 

00:03:35.499 --> 00:03:36.990
 won't do right now 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.670
 on the other hand you have a contact person right here 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:41.579
 list 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:45.049
 but you can also set and add it yourself and the middle 

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:47.190
 four buttons with the full now 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.380
 well now what a phonebook has occupied an rc lens head and those srs buy in there 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:55.270
 you can define three numbers that should be called as 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.320
 how much should your son or daughter press that button 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.939
 you can do as number one you can do yourself as number two yes the border 

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:02.969
 and if we have three grandparents, for example 

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:06.580
 and he keeps on calling until one of the three numbers answers 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.629
 so that says in an emergency 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:12.080
 He does not have a GPS signal that you cannot see in your yard where you are 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:13.120
 child is standing 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.299
 but the afternoon lierse sk on your child can also call right away and personally 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:17.549
 have contact with you 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.049
 no i also find another player tooske everything udema is built in actually 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:22.240
 an inexpensive telephone 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.240
 he can simply play music lived by peter drucker 6 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.150
 it is also right that the speaker does quite well with that opportunity 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:34.080
 6 jesse yes that is fine again if you are calling then you can be you 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.309
 there is so understandable smoke for your child 

00:04:36.309 --> 00:04:38.240
 and there is a history on it 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.870
 well still care they still watch sms clock settings you can be a special one 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.080
 use pain more for different times and also give a name 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.740
 For example, imagine your child taking certain medications a few times a day 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.530
 you can enter it completely in those times and then you immediately get one 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:54.960
 automatic notification of hake 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.600
 now take medication 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.420
 yes i am quite a multimedia options as i said the seat camera on 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:04.830
 the camera is not really nice in terms of angle what for 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.419
 he takes pictures 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:10.379
 there is a strong field for that, it is fine and it is yes 

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:11.440
 children find this 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.510
 very nice a cool that is just completely built-in 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:18.200
 nature a bit managers bound appearance and with the button on the 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.830
 top on the right side 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.960
 you always go one the back 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.290
 now look further into the now 

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:27.820
 you can also just upload files yes it is on and on 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:29.830
 computer and popular circle found video 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.139
 photo or ring music files 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:33.240
 yes put a drop 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.059
 and see that if you have a video card 

00:05:35.059 --> 00:05:37.289
 latch has the sound turned up or down 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:40.639
 you can start playing and according to claim you can also put on fox 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:43.419
 and then he will just play that video which of course is quite a challenge 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:44.960
 is four 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.240
 well finally 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:49.789
 if we go a little further, when will there still be general settings 

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:52.930
 so you have yourself which internet services should it be possible 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.970
 travel completely simlock free using the icons with a subscription or 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:57.750
 sim card with an umbrella 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:00.169
 you can choose that yourself 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:03.580
 but yes we see that you are actually quite complete personally I think so 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.530
 I still use a lot of functions 

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:07.919
 that maybe even a little simpler for children 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:11.909
 but in itself yes you have all possibilities to use everything 

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:15.869
 and that of course makes it very useful and also very much count 

00:06:15.869 --> 00:06:17.990
 Well, Oostwijk is ideal, however 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.229
 for if you are not constantly yes with nerves at home or to know 

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:22.199
 where your child is 

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:23.860
 or to know if everything is going well 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.740
 You can always call your child. The child can always call you 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:30.759
 what is going on and so you can always safely assume that it is 

00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:32.180
 that all is well 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.580
 inside more information about this hovo wear out or rather equal one 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.610
 order for yourself or for your daughter 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:41.849
 then go to p diageo point nl or the ecb or get attention and from 

00:06:41.849 --> 00:06:42.470
 Our stores
