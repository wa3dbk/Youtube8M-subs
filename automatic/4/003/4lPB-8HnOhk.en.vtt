00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.970
 hi friends with godfathers, we got out 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.400
 a little bit you need Donets so briefly 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.450
 and taking this opportunity I want to tell you 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.710
 about one little thing 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.590
 which has long wanted to tell but 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.380
 Tony was a time not forget something else 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.699
 know anything but the hole when she told me 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.510
 look what I like things on trips 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:28.560
 multifunction so that they can be one 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.769
 and the same thing could be used 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.710
 quite differently I told that 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.780
 nylon pieces there still about something now 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.960
 I want to talk about his new soldiers 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.960
 the belt 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.340
 such a belt is practically a soldier's 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.430
 belt 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.960
 canvas seems but use it 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.290
 can be completely different how you 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:59.199
 You know they are worth some 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.050
 mere pennies but i use them 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:03.250
 Naturally a few pieces bought 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.979
 using as a belt respectively 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:09.580
 because well knives sit here on 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:11.320
 this is not very wide narrow well 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.409

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:19.420

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:21.729
 This is the most your girl is sleeping here 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.840
 two squeezing and if on a backpack 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:27.130
 there is a moth, it's generally cool 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.570

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.920
 belts between length my for 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.080
 we fasten moles in general 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.229
