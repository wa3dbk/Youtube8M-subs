 95- year-old joyon find themselves for a 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.010
 any new video with the 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:31.410
 beautiful of the great of will i am gorgeous am 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:33.500
 coc swag so today we find ourselves 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.880
 for what kind of video a video 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.450
 idea information we saw like that 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.710
 because as you know them 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.930
 does not explain in quotation marks were made 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.550
 spoiled and so we decided to 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.620
 design and all the novelties that there 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.690
 was going to have 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.820
 so we'll start right away 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.469
 I think there's the most 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.559
 important of this update which 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:58.260
 should be soon before so who 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.559
 come out the first stick pic no on 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.750
 thought we would offer you 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.030
 ideas for this already this new 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.909
 troupe the dragon 5 that I'm going all of 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.500
 Following you introduce after Basel in all 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.790
 right away I have this more than I wanted 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.040
 say 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.630
 so they 'll have to 5 why I 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.560
 do not do it's me who did I too 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.960
 want to clarify it 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.270
 so we already live a lot of time in 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.350
 prepare all these pictures because that 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.200
 still asks for some work 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.070
 edit images because there is 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.180
 quite shocking even on every detail 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.409
 so it does not answer 5 maybe it's 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.329
 because I managed the best 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.090
 but frankly I find it is 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.159
 still not bad so this dragon bag 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.670
 why blue like this is in 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:44.220
 reference of course at the bronze level 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:47.549
 so it's a little bit to handle 11 as well 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.549
 going out but so all the defenses 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:54.720
 we made are on this theme of the blue 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:56.250
 like that so here it is to remember 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.049
 that's exactly it and also for 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.780
 show to change appearance a little 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:03.719
 he was grafted armor on the chest 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.520
 to strengthen his back smashes Guinea 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:08.819
 higher concentrated he is stronger 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.979
 and all that, so here he has an armor 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.880
 because we imagine it like that on 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.820
 we'll go to the mortar I think 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.400
 yeah so the mortar frankly 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.520
 a beautiful mortar mortar level 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.890
 9 still a nude dress 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.390
 this is a new mortar quickly 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.460
 improved by 8 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.200
 we go to nine and so with all these 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.960
 little stuff that was yellow at the base 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.550
 orange yellow like that so I 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.990
 found transformed with whom three 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.850
 colors here I say a little how 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.540
 I did so it's a little bit the effects 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:43.030
 which for it to appear a little more 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.520
 down more realistic and so that's it's a 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.250
 little mortar that has not really changed 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.020
 apart from the colors but that's what has a 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.630
 look really a little more stylish and so 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:55.360
 this defense so the heater when who 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:57.460
 should really bother I think the 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.070
 wine on the move and above all you go before 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:02.620
 maybe a little bit I know in relation to 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:03.850
 giants to the barbarians 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.560
 it's okay maybe they touch them as much 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.260
 stuff needs but I think it's 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.210
 very early actually mortars 8 I 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.730
 I'm not sure at last I'm not sure 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:13.990
 anyway that's it it's not changed that 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.540
 physically he also changed to 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.350
 defense and in attack ie it 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.900
 do more damage 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.660
 anyway every time there is a 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.580
 boom the flights normally it does 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.400
 something extra in the game that 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.050
 announces less costs and will put a 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.320
 troupe some hole a thing like 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.840
 it 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.850
 it's still a pretty good thing so 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.760
 it's always good to improve 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:39.000
 mortars even though at this level there 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:43.270
 still find that it serves a lot 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:48.130
 Here now I'll cut speech 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:50.680
 but here I launch the 3rd 2nd defense 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:53.890
 sorry but already the third novelty 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:57.040
 so that's the level 13 gun so that's it 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:59.920
 always in this type 2 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.319
 of the idea here in the blue always a 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.209
 blue friendly enough frankly so 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:06.370
 so here is the cannon quite well done 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:09.579
 frankly you find what I do 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.959
 is just sublime goal on this here the past 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:13.000
 not much to say because it 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.859
 stays in the same theme it and increases 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.049
 in defense and in attack too 

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:18.130
 but he has it he really has a lot of 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:19.600
 bags I find that it will go much better 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.919
 with the ramparts dany bronze because 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.810
 otherwise it was a bit of a contrast or 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:24.810
 the blues it was weird 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.590
 in any case if it's like that it's not 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.840
 sure we do not know because it is 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.280
 ideas we call it back so yeah 

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.990
 it could go really well on 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.240
 travels of the world's first who have 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:40.150
 really in this race allows chain 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.500
 to make his walls 11 that frankly if 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.599
 we do not have to pay in the game it's 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.410
 almost impossible to have them here 

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:49.599
 so we also have the demo version of 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:52.060
 laboratory so there the vase presents it 

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:54.430
 it then I have to find my 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.830
 slim for the eyes maersk so here 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.810
 in a group via the laboratory interface 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.580
 said she was going to change in the 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.560
 pauliste not at all sure but hey 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.419
 it's almost safe so basically 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.970
 I imagined it coming there is it 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:09.310
 all on one side there is a panel like in 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.110
 number the barracks la save indicated 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:12.789
 that normal troops made from wax 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.110
 you click on the right arrow that 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:15.760
 tells you the troops based 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.960
 of elections will have improved but 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.400
 once that tells you the sisters and 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.130
 you can turn like that like on 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.780
 the barracks now up to standards to 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.970
 mauvezin ensure that the improvement 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.320
 you were doing the duration and the number of 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:29.139
 I like it cost and then you'll have 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.940
 in addition what it improves on the troop 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:32.260
 especially not to say ah yeah 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.240
 I forgot how much her best of the 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:36.880
 to gobble ok so that would tell you 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.020
 directly you will avoid two too many 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.659
 galley even though I think you 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:45.699
 not too much gal do that yeah so 

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:47.699
 that's it not at all on everything already 

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:50.289
 it feels like you 'll see these disassemblies 

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:52.240
 it's not a real defense if not 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:53.590
 are saying that the astonished signifies 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.930
 will come out of clash we would see when 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:57.759
 same as that stuff i think will know 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:58.900
 much more stylish than ours 

00:05:57.759 --> 00:06:00.070
 world tried to do something on 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:02.020
 will try to present you some 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.190
 ideas like that you can do yourself 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.410
 a little idea 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:07.930
 it may not be sure that it will be 

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:09.610
 in this style but here we wanted 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:12.280
 really do you will offer this 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:15.070
 video that seemed frankly fart 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:16.510
 not bad interesting here and there 

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:20.980
 arrives at the end of the video 

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:23.470
 novel there hello video do not hesitate 

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:24.670
 to unleash a like on both videos on 

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:26.770
 the two chains because the link of 

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:28.720
 each video of each channel will be in 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:30.190
