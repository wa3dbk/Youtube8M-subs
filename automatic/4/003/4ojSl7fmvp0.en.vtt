what do you think about playing against
other<00:04:13.989> top-tier<00:04:14.989> mid<00:04:15.260> laners<00:04:15.590> like<00:04:15.830> a

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 
other top-tier mid laners like a

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.400 
other top-tier mid laners like a
barracks<00:04:16.280> in<00:04:16.519> high<00:04:18.040> who<00:04:19.040> do<00:04:19.100> you<00:04:19.220> consider

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
barracks in high who do you consider

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.600 
barracks in high who do you consider
very<00:04:21.410> strong<00:04:21.739> and<00:04:22.040> maybe<00:04:23.030> you<00:04:23.930> take<00:04:24.230> after

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
very strong and maybe you take after

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.159 
very strong and maybe you take after
think<00:04:25.610> the<00:04:25.820> mid<00:04:26.030> lane<00:04:26.210> now<00:04:26.570> it's<00:04:26.810> like<00:04:26.930> all

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:27.169 
think the mid lane now it's like all

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:29.380 
think the mid lane now it's like all
about<00:04:27.500> the<00:04:27.710> one<00:04:27.919> game<00:04:28.160> from<00:04:28.669> the<00:04:28.729> tumbler

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:29.390 
about the one game from the tumbler

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:30.770 
about the one game from the tumbler
support<00:04:29.810> so

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
support so

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.950 
support so
I<00:04:31.580> think<00:04:32.580> like<00:04:32.700> every<00:04:33.120> millions<00:04:33.840> like

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
I think like every millions like

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.580 
I think like every millions like
mechanic<00:04:34.470> select<00:04:34.880> like<00:04:35.880> same<00:04:36.180> or<00:04:36.389> similar

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590
