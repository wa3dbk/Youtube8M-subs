00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.680
The press release for this new Lexus SUV says, and i quote:

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.740
'The new Lexus NX, was developed as a premium SUV

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.160
able to deliver a high performance standard, etc, etc, etc...'

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:39.820
Well, with prices ranging between €47.000 and €65.500 (in Portugal),

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:50.420
a top speed of 180kph and a o-100kph time of 9.3s.... i mean..... !

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.060
These are numbers hard to digest in this premium segment

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.340
and even when we look further down,

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.700
we find better performances

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.540
and better fuel consumption than the 8.5ltrs/100km that i'm seing on the onboard computer,

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.714
One thing i can say though:

00:01:24.714 --> 00:01:27.214
 'Germans, suffer with envy!'

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:34.000
Because on the aesthetic side, this NX, rapidly compensates for any performance letdown! 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.380
The NX 300h has a hybrid powertrain

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.720
that combines a 4 cylinder 2.5 petrol engine with 155hp

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.160
to a 143hp electric motor,  

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.520
representing a combined output of 197hp... 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.400
which, to pull a dry weight of over 1.900kg... becomes a little 'short'...

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:19.180
Thanks God for the ecological conscience of driving a premium SUV with only 117g/km of CO2 emissions!

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.980
If in a common 'drag race' it would be easily beaten by small hatchbacks with half of the power,

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:34.020
when we look at its interior, the Lexus proves its valor and leaves us speechless!

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.860
Very well chosen materials,

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.440
a 'space shuttle' design

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.260
and a very robust build quality,

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.900
reminding a certain brand started by 'Mer' and ending in 'Cedes'!

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.680
It catches the eye not only in terms of quality but also in the terms oh interior space,

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.420
that allows me, being 180cm tall, to seat very comfortably in the rear seats...

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.660
Behind me is a boot with a 555 ltrs capacity,

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.900
wide enough to carry two golf bags

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.060
or.... 555 litres of...

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:15.480
...stuff!

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.280
Behind the wheel, there are some 'not so goods',

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.440
for i still couldn't get round the 'truck driver' style driving position

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.700
and although it provides excellent visibility, i'm not seating as good as i'd like.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:50.100
The whole lightness is a main feature and the general smoothness of the ride is really very good!

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.520
The engine is completely vibration free

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.580
and even when we're driving in pure electric mode,

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:02.480
you have to pay close attention to the rev counter, just to feel when the engine is working or not...

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.760
Unless you become a bit more aggressive with the gas pedal and then...

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.700
no more 'peace&amp;quiet'!

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.980
Despite an excellent noise insulation in lower revs,

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.620
as soon as we summon the 197hp,

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.360
the 2.5 rockets straight to the red line, 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.240
followed by a rough noise that's not in any way nice...

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:37.780
much worse than the noise produced by the IS300h we drove a couple of months ago.

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:39.280
To reconsider..

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.980
In terms of handling, pretty good i must say!

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.900
With a comfortable ride and very controlled body roll, 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.440
it's far better than most of its peers,

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.880
together with a certain Maxda CX-5 that we already had the chance to review in the past.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.700
Braking power is good, but hard to modulate

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.900
due to a long pedal travel,

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.340
a needed requirement to accommodate two braking stages;

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.060
the first in which only the inversion of the electric motor operates

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.400
and the second when the hydraulic system kicks in.

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.640
Nothing that most people won't get used to...

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:39.600
This FWD version with an 'Executive+' line of equipment,

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.460
can be yours for less than €53.000 (in Portugal)

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:48.780
and if you opt for the AWD one, price will go up to €55.000.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:54.020
Shockingly beautiful inside out...

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:57.520
but somewhat 'limp' for more demanding sprints,

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.060
it's not going to have an easy life...
