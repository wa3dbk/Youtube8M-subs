00:00:08.829 --> 00:00:14.669
 from the permafrost around the Arctic Circle to the cloud, Namibia's fire is one and one 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:18.529
 Now the GLK has to be voted out 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:27.780
 therefore 24 degrees below zero 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.670
 ideal conditions for the Mercedes Benz engineers their latest 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:36.060
 Developments that were still heavily disguised put ElCom through its paces 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.930
 Percent just Dechen winter 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.120
 can affect road conditions within fractions of a second 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.260
 Snow everywhere reads up to the yard he allows to lead the road and that is 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.260
 of course very demanding for us so vital 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.640
 and before the workday begins 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.650
 First the viability of the ice is checked for most of the tests 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.140
 are driven on a frozen lake 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.670
 since the same test conditions can always prevail here 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.390
 Results are achieved 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.110
 With the help of a psychologist there will be safety on the entire route 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.400
 checked 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.440
 besides, that stood 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.680
 Tests belongs to the slalom in which the various control systems under 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.680
 Have to prove 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.230
 another test whirls up dust 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:36.430
 the simulated snowstorm must not restrict the air supply to the engine 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.560
 because if the engine can suck less air, it brings less power 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.290
 Exam successfully passed 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.520
 At the end of a tough day of testing in the White Hell, all vehicles will be in 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.490
 A workshop closely examined and then again for new tests 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:01.800
 To be available 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.700
 the claim August 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:04.729
 as reliable 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:07.729
 even under the conditions of the practical winter 

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:22.950
 of the 1, Sweden's hot weather in Namibia would have to be here too 

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:26.059
 the GLK face the guy of the team 

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:31.639
 in particular the 4matic all-wheel drive and the Act 4 and GTS 4 GTS 

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:35.909
 have to prove their skills here Namibia offers the 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:38.180
 Test drivers a variety of terrain 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.390
 from the desert landscape to the rocky ground 

00:02:45.249 --> 00:02:48.249
 the Krefelder route progression he is director 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.439
 Action Plans System 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:54.439
 Colleagues from the other communities will be 

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:57.149
 with the unexpected 

00:02:57.149 --> 00:02:59.799
 some of them 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:02.799
 Dresden's film very good 

00:03:05.899 --> 00:03:07.399
 the technique a torture 

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:11.299
 That is why vehicles are regularly inspected in Africa too 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:14.929
 prepared for use in the toughest terrain 

00:03:14.929 --> 00:03:19.219
 these second few inhabitants of Namibia are drifting from the rain 

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:24.309
 Engineers completely unimpressed they do not know all-wheel drive also the GLK 

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:25.479
 however, already 

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:30.069
 his biggest challenges are Kita St and the extreme 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:32.749
 Temperatures dapd 

00:03:32.749 --> 00:03:35.749
 also will 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:41.019
 before the tests can be started here according to a standardized procedure 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:44.019
 Nature of the ground 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:49.239
 through the dessert 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:50.459
 who will be here 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.459
 and leaves is prepared for any situation 

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:59.339
 is a character type 

00:03:59.339 --> 00:04:00.449
