midsize SUV that we've shown last year
but<00:01:32.320> brought<00:01:32.740> that<00:01:33.039> further<00:01:33.399> into<00:01:33.910> a<00:01:33.940> more

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
but brought that further into a more

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.249 
but brought that further into a more
dynamic<00:01:35.320> who<00:01:36.190> pitch<00:01:36.430> design<00:01:36.910> this<00:01:37.780> one<00:01:38.050> behind

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:38.259 
dynamic who pitch design this one behind

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:40.920 
dynamic who pitch design this one behind
me<00:01:38.649> the<00:01:38.800> cross<00:01:39.009> coupe<00:01:39.310> GTE<00:01:39.670> is<00:01:39.910> a<00:01:40.119> five-seater

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
me the cross coupe GTE is a five-seater

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.620 
me the cross coupe GTE is a five-seater
so<00:01:41.410> that<00:01:41.560> would<00:01:41.710> be<00:01:41.830> a<00:01:41.860> potential<00:01:42.340> five<00:01:43.270> seater

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
so that would be a potential five seater

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.980 
so that would be a potential five seater
derivative<00:01:44.530> with<00:01:45.070> similarities<00:01:45.850> to<00:01:46.180> the<00:01:46.300> 7

besides<00:01:50.080> the<00:01:50.319> design<00:01:50.679> language<00:01:51.539> some<00:01:52.539> other

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.800 
besides the design language some other

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.290 
besides the design language some other
really<00:01:53.800> news<00:01:54.160> in<00:01:54.429> this<00:01:54.610> one<00:01:55.410> first<00:01:56.410> it's<00:01:56.830> the

00:02:03.059 --> 00:02:03.069 
it's a GTE so it combines v6 engine with

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:06.719 
it's a GTE so it combines v6 engine with
two<00:02:03.340> electrical<00:02:04.119> editions<00:02:04.929> so<00:02:05.110> a<00:02:05.740> hybrid<00:02:06.220> and
