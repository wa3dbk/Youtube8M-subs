00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
this thing Drive while here on the

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.640 
this thing Drive while here on the
Spring<00:02:16.850> Mountain<00:02:17.180> Raceway<00:02:17.540> let's<00:02:17.990> open<00:02:18.200> it<00:02:18.530> up

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
Spring Mountain Raceway let's open it up

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.030 
Spring Mountain Raceway let's open it up
and<00:02:18.890> see<00:02:19.400> what<00:02:19.910> it<00:02:20.060> does

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.770 

I<00:02:24.099> should<00:02:24.640> start<00:02:24.939> by<00:02:25.000> saying<00:02:25.120> of<00:02:25.480> course<00:02:25.510> this

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
I should start by saying of course this

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.559 
I should start by saying of course this
is<00:02:25.930> a<00:02:25.959> manual<00:02:26.469> gearbox

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
is a manual gearbox

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.099

front brakes but nothing too different
this<00:02:39.819> thing<00:02:40.060> is<00:02:40.209> fast<00:02:40.540> it<00:02:40.930> is<00:02:41.170> really<00:02:41.829> fast

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
this thing is fast it is really fast

fourth gear here I don't want to look at

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:47.729 
fourth gear here I don't want to look at
the<00:02:45.220> start<00:02:45.489> we're<00:02:45.640> doing<00:02:45.790> 120<00:02:46.319> hard<00:02:47.319> on<00:02:47.620> the

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
traction control you see there by the

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.089 
traction control you see there by the
rear<00:02:57.730> coming<00:02:58.060> out<00:02:58.530> what<00:02:59.530> you<00:02:59.680> do<00:02:59.829> notice

rear coming out what you do notice
though<00:03:00.489> is<00:03:00.939> there's<00:03:01.299> a<00:03:01.359> lot<00:03:01.659> of<00:03:01.810> understeer<00:03:02.379> in

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
though is there's a lot of understeer in

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.110 
though is there's a lot of understeer in
this<00:03:02.739> car<00:03:03.040> on<00:03:03.549> the<00:03:03.760> mid<00:03:03.970> to<00:03:04.180> low<00:03:04.359> speed<00:03:06.120> really

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
this car on the mid to low speed really

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.250 
this car on the mid to low speed really
what<00:03:07.359> are<00:03:07.419> you<00:03:07.480> going<00:03:07.599> to<00:03:07.659> do<00:03:07.810> about<00:03:08.049> that

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
what are you going to do about that

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.149 
what are you going to do about that
because<00:03:08.879> the<00:03:09.879> general<00:03:10.359> Mustang<00:03:10.750> g/t<00:03:11.169> in<00:03:11.290> 2015

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:12.159 
because the general Mustang g/t in 2015

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:13.500 
because the general Mustang g/t in 2015
is<00:03:12.400> quite<00:03:12.730> front-heavy

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
is quite front-heavy

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.569 
is quite front-heavy
now<00:03:14.500> we've<00:03:14.680> just<00:03:14.709> added<00:03:15.129> a<00:03:15.189> massive

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
now we've just added a massive

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:18.750 
now we've just added a massive
supercharger<00:03:16.239> to<00:03:16.359> this<00:03:16.530> so<00:03:17.530> naturally<00:03:18.489> it's

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
supercharger to this so naturally it's

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.240 
supercharger to this so naturally it's
even<00:03:19.269> heavier<00:03:19.720> you're<00:03:20.470> always<00:03:20.709> going<00:03:21.099> to<00:03:21.159> be

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
even heavier you're always going to be

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.940 
even heavier you're always going to be
fighting<00:03:21.489> understeer<00:03:22.180> I<00:03:22.450> would<00:03:23.349> like<00:03:23.590> to<00:03:23.620> up

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
fighting understeer I would like to up

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.080 
fighting understeer I would like to up
the<00:03:24.040> spring<00:03:24.280> rate<00:03:24.489> by<00:03:24.639> a<00:03:24.669> couple<00:03:24.849> of<00:03:25.000> hundred

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
the spring rate by a couple of hundred

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.619 
the spring rate by a couple of hundred
pounds<00:03:26.609> probably<00:03:27.609> some<00:03:27.909> sniffing<00:03:28.239> rear<00:03:28.419> roll

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:28.629 
pounds probably some sniffing rear roll
