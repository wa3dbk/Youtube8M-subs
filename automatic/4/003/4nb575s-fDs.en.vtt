140 with about 40 was despair and the

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.379 
140 with about 40 was despair and the
last<00:00:06.600> for<00:00:07.560> over<00:00:07.799> the<00:00:07.919> last<00:00:08.040> target<00:00:08.550> 12<00:00:08.880> 14<00:00:09.360> and

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
last for over the last target 12 14 and

well<00:01:10.960> the<00:01:11.259> one<00:01:11.470> thing<00:01:11.500> about<00:01:11.830> the<00:01:12.100> strategy

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
well the one thing about the strategy

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.050 
well the one thing about the strategy
though<00:01:12.790> that<00:01:13.409> gérant<00:01:14.409> AGI<00:01:14.740> is<00:01:14.799> employing<00:01:15.280> is

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
though that gérant AGI is employing is

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.280 
though that gérant AGI is employing is
that<00:01:16.210> if<00:01:16.299> you<00:01:16.390> look<00:01:16.420> at<00:01:16.630> the<00:01:16.659> leg<00:01:16.900> side<00:01:17.080> there's

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
that if you look at the leg side there's

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.800 
that if you look at the leg side there's
only<00:01:17.440> a<00:01:17.560> fine<00:01:17.860> leg<00:01:18.130> on<00:01:18.340> out<00:01:18.909> out<00:01:18.970> out<00:01:19.360> on<00:01:19.720> the

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
only a fine leg on out out out on the

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.320 
only a fine leg on out out out on the
circle<00:01:20.200> and<00:01:20.890> he's<00:01:21.130> got<00:01:21.310> and<00:01:21.640> he's<00:01:21.850> coming<00:01:22.119> in

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
circle and he's got and he's coming in

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.889 
circle and he's got and he's coming in
now<00:01:22.509> so<00:01:22.750> I<00:01:22.810> mean<00:01:23.700> basically<00:01:24.700> if<00:01:25.270> a<00:01:25.479> batsman

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:25.899 
now so I mean basically if a batsman

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:27.930 
now so I mean basically if a batsman
tries<00:01:26.080> to<00:01:26.259> pull<00:01:26.440> he<00:01:26.530> gets<00:01:26.710> a<00:01:26.830> top<00:01:27.039> edge<00:01:27.250> or

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
tries to pull he gets a top edge or

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.109 
tries to pull he gets a top edge or
doesn't<00:01:28.450> time<00:01:28.630> with<00:01:28.780> tool<00:01:29.729> that's<00:01:30.729> runs<00:01:30.970> in

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
doesn't time with tool that's runs in

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:33.870 
doesn't time with tool that's runs in
the<00:01:31.210> bank<00:01:31.890> so<00:01:32.890> I<00:01:32.920> don't<00:01:33.190> she<00:01:33.399> will<00:01:33.550> see<00:01:33.700> another

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
the bank so I don't she will see another

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.910 
the bank so I don't she will see another
shot<00:01:34.179> fish<00:01:34.360> delivery<00:01:34.509> year<00:01:34.960> now<00:01:37.770> but<00:01:38.770> then

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
shot fish delivery year now but then

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:45.809 
shot fish delivery year now but then
again<00:01:41.220> maybe<00:01:42.220> we'll<00:01:43.920> well<00:01:44.920> I<00:01:44.950> think<00:01:45.190> he<00:01:45.369> knows

00:01:45.809 --> 00:01:45.819 
again maybe we'll well I think he knows

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:48.480 
again maybe we'll well I think he knows
that<00:01:46.090> a<00:01:46.330> lot<00:01:46.600> of<00:01:46.690> batsmen<00:01:47.110> at<00:01:47.350> one<00:01:48.250> in<00:01:48.340> this

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
that a lot of batsmen at one in this

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.460 
that a lot of batsmen at one in this
form<00:01:48.700> the<00:01:48.789> game<00:01:48.970> and<00:01:49.270> the<00:01:49.929> celebrity<00:01:50.289> cricket

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
form the game and the celebrity cricket

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.160 
form the game and the celebrity cricket
league<00:01:50.590> don't<00:01:51.429> really<00:01:51.640> pull<00:01:52.149> or<00:01:52.569> hook<00:01:52.960> with

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
any measure of certainty especially not

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.419 
any measure of certainty especially not
when<00:01:55.780> you<00:01:55.899> target<00:01:56.170> it<00:01:56.440> so<00:01:56.649> well<00:01:56.860> because<00:01:57.069> his

00:01:57.419 --> 00:01:57.429 
when you target it so well because his

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:00.210 
when you target it so well because his
