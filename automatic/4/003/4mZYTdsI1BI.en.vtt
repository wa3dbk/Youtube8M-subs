00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
okay let's freeze it here okay the

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.510 
okay let's freeze it here okay the
player<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:21.990> marked<00:01:22.320> here<00:01:22.560> should<00:01:23.009> be<00:01:23.130> marking

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
player of marked here should be marking

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.280 
player of marked here should be marking
the<00:01:23.640> person<00:01:24.060> here<00:01:24.360> because<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:24.840> is<00:01:24.869> quite

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
the person here because it is quite

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.929 
the person here because it is quite
evident<00:01:25.470> that<00:01:25.890> this<00:01:26.100> player<00:01:26.340> wants<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.729> run

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
evident that this player wants to run

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.789 
evident that this player wants to run
here<00:01:27.330> so<00:01:27.659> clearly<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.140> would<00:01:28.200> make<00:01:28.409> sense<00:01:28.650> for

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
here so clearly it would make sense for

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.859 
here so clearly it would make sense for
my<00:01:29.040> player<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.549> what<00:01:29.759> she's<00:01:30.000> run<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.450> stay

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
my player to what she's run and stay

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.140 
my player to what she's run and stay
tight<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.409> him<00:01:31.590> this<00:01:31.799> would<00:01:31.979> save<00:01:32.250> my<00:01:32.729> defender

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
tight to him this would save my defender

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.660 
tight to him this would save my defender
from<00:01:33.570> having<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:34.020> change<00:01:34.290> position<00:01:34.920> I<00:01:35.040> marked

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
from having to change position I marked

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.359 
from having to change position I marked
the<00:01:35.759> guy<00:01:35.970> Martin<00:01:36.810> red<00:01:37.049> instead<00:01:37.590> my<00:01:38.009> defender

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
the guy Martin red instead my defender

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.609 
the guy Martin red instead my defender
can<00:01:38.909> now<00:01:39.060> mark<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.540> guy<00:01:39.689> behind<00:01:40.049> him<00:01:40.229> and

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
can now mark the guy behind him and

it<00:01:46.470> oh<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:47.040> now<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.640> previous<00:01:48.030> player<00:01:48.360> I<00:01:48.540> had

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
it oh and now the previous player I had

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.020 
it oh and now the previous player I had
marked<00:01:49.079> before<00:01:49.259> has<00:01:49.860> now<00:01:50.100> decided<00:01:50.490> he<00:01:50.790> wants

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
marked before has now decided he wants

to<00:01:51.119> go<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.540> sidelines<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.439> is<00:01:52.649> now

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
to go to the sidelines and is now

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:54.740 
to go to the sidelines and is now
oblivious<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.640> fact<00:01:53.670> that<00:01:53.970> this<00:01:54.270> attacker

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
oblivious to the fact that this attacker

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.440

now<00:01:55.320> has<00:01:55.590> free<00:01:55.920> space<00:01:56.280> so<00:01:56.640> now<00:01:56.790> my<00:01:57.090> defender

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
now has free space so now my defender

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.330 
now has free space so now my defender
has<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.750> change<00:01:58.020> position<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:58.740> stop<00:01:59.189> the

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
incoming attacker and guess what this

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.520 
incoming attacker and guess what this
leaves<00:02:02.009> space<00:02:02.310> for<00:02:02.369> Lavezzi<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.570> run<00:02:03.750> into<00:02:04.140> now

he's made a fatal error and that it's

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.860 
he's made a fatal error and that it's
running<00:02:11.489> to<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.730> sidelines<00:02:12.180> was<00:02:12.569> probably

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
running to the sidelines was probably

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.550 
running to the sidelines was probably
not<00:02:13.080> the<00:02:13.140> best

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
not the best

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.490 
not the best
idea<00:02:13.980> nonetheless<00:02:14.459> this<00:02:15.300> now<00:02:15.540> means<00:02:15.840> that<00:02:16.319> any

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
idea nonetheless this now means that any

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.290 
idea nonetheless this now means that any
pole<00:02:16.830> worked<00:02:17.040> in<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.370> books<00:02:17.610> is<00:02:17.850> now<00:02:18.150> an

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
pole worked in the books is now an

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.300 
pole worked in the books is now an
instant<00:02:18.780> go<00:02:19.020> the<00:02:19.590> reason<00:02:19.680> for<00:02:19.920> this<00:02:20.069> is

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
instant go the reason for this is

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.280 
instant go the reason for this is
because<00:02:20.550> all<00:02:20.910> my<00:02:21.090> defenders<00:02:21.630> are<00:02:21.780> now<00:02:22.080> in

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
because all my defenders are now in

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.590 
because all my defenders are now in
terrible<00:02:22.770> positions<00:02:23.340> to<00:02:23.790> defend<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.300> cross

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
terrible positions to defend the cross

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.949 
terrible positions to defend the cross
and<00:02:24.959> is<00:02:25.140> thus<00:02:25.380> why<00:02:25.890> I<00:02:26.220> conceded<00:02:27.030> this<00:02:27.420> crappy

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
and is thus why I conceded this crappy

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.520 
and is thus why I conceded this crappy
