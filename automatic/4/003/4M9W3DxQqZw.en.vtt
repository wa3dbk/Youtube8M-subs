in<00:00:01.580> the<00:00:01.819> first<00:00:02.000> of<00:00:02.150> the<00:00:02.240> it<00:00:02.330> energies<00:00:02.659> is<00:00:02.929> the

00:00:03.519 --> 00:00:03.529 
in the first of the it energies is the

00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:05.650 
in the first of the it energies is the
ward<00:00:03.770> off<00:00:03.949> energy<00:00:04.160> does<00:00:04.910> anyone<00:00:05.180> remember<00:00:05.299> the

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:05.660 
ward off energy does anyone remember the

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:07.599 
ward off energy does anyone remember the
other<00:00:06.200> than<00:00:06.500> black<00:00:06.620> sashes<00:00:06.919> does<00:00:07.279> anyone

00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:07.609 
other than black sashes does anyone

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:12.820 
other than black sashes does anyone
remember<00:00:07.729> the<00:00:08.590> element<00:00:09.590> okay<00:00:10.490> the<00:00:10.639> image<00:00:11.830> that

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:12.830 
remember the element okay the image that

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:15.520 
remember the element okay the image that
is<00:00:12.860> for<00:00:13.219> ward<00:00:13.519> off<00:00:13.639> energy

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:15.530 
is for ward off energy

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.670 
is for ward off energy
sky<00:00:16.190> is<00:00:16.250> actually<00:00:16.850> right<00:00:17.000> there's<00:00:17.420> a<00:00:17.539> Scott<00:00:17.840> of

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:18.680 
sky is actually right there's a Scott of

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.460 
sky is actually right there's a Scott of
sky<00:00:19.670> and<00:00:20.180> you<00:00:20.240> can<00:00:20.360> think<00:00:20.480> about<00:00:20.599> that<00:00:20.779> sky<00:00:21.140> and

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470 
sky and you can think about that sky and

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.029 
sky and you can think about that sky and
ward<00:00:21.800> off<00:00:21.950> they<00:00:22.460> go<00:00:22.490> together<00:00:23.110> okay

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.039 
ward off they go together okay

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.630 
ward off they go together okay
um<00:00:25.689> and<00:00:26.689> you<00:00:27.619> want<00:00:27.949> to<00:00:28.039> think<00:00:28.220> of<00:00:28.279> it<00:00:28.400> that's

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
um and you want to think of it that's

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.630 
um and you want to think of it that's
the<00:00:28.849> three<00:00:29.150> Yong<00:00:29.419> Yong<00:00:29.660> correct<00:00:30.279> it's<00:00:31.279> a<00:00:31.369> song

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
the three Yong Yong correct it's a song

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.299 
the three Yong Yong correct it's a song
Yong<00:00:31.939> Yong<00:00:32.239> so<00:00:32.570> with<00:00:32.899> it<00:00:33.079> the<00:00:33.620> eighth<00:00:33.800> diagram

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
Yong Yong so with it the eighth diagram

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:36.759 
Yong Yong so with it the eighth diagram
right<00:00:35.180> made<00:00:35.600> up<00:00:35.690> again<00:00:35.960> and<00:00:36.050> young<00:00:36.199> broken

00:00:36.759 --> 00:00:36.769 
right made up again and young broken

00:00:36.769 --> 00:00:40.090 
right made up again and young broken
line<00:00:36.980> is<00:00:37.250> in<00:00:37.760> solid<00:00:38.329> line<00:00:38.510> as<00:00:38.690> young<00:00:38.899> so<00:00:39.800> young

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
line is in solid line as young so young

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.660 
line is in solid line as young so young
young<00:00:40.610> young<00:00:40.809> okay<00:00:41.809> now<00:00:42.680> a<00:00:42.980> lot<00:00:43.220> of<00:00:43.309> times<00:00:43.519> when

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
young young okay now a lot of times when

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.780 
young young okay now a lot of times when
you<00:00:43.790> implement<00:00:44.440> the<00:00:45.440> ward<00:00:45.649> off<00:00:45.829> you<00:00:46.399> will<00:00:46.610> use

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:46.790 
you implement the ward off you will use

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.880 
you implement the ward off you will use
in<00:00:47.390> so<00:00:47.659> you're<00:00:47.780> not<00:00:47.870> really<00:00:47.930> the<00:00:48.409> board<00:00:48.739> office

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
in so you're not really the board office

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.340 
in so you're not really the board office
beginning<00:00:49.579> your<00:00:50.329> pull<00:00:50.659> back<00:00:50.870> or<00:00:51.229> its

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
beginning your pull back or its

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:52.840 
beginning your pull back or its
beginning<00:00:51.769> and<00:00:52.070> going<00:00:52.250> into<00:00:52.370> something<00:00:52.729> else

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
beginning and going into something else

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.030 
beginning and going into something else
but<00:00:53.089> we<00:00:53.180> want<00:00:53.360> to<00:00:53.420> isolate<00:00:53.570> it<00:00:53.989> and<00:00:54.140> look<00:00:54.379> just

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:55.040 
but we want to isolate it and look just

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.520 
but we want to isolate it and look just
at<00:00:55.280> the<00:00:55.760> ward<00:00:55.969> off<00:00:56.120> so<00:00:56.510> three<00:00:56.750> Yong<00:00:56.989> Yong<00:00:57.199> three

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
at the ward off so three Yong Yong three

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.789 
at the ward off so three Yong Yong three
solid<00:00:57.769> line<00:00:58.070> means<00:00:58.909> young<00:00:59.299> young<00:00:59.659> young<00:00:59.900> so

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:00.799 
solid line means young young young so

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:04.660 
solid line means young young young so
ward<00:01:01.580> off<00:01:01.699> implies<00:01:02.390> blocking<00:01:02.989> okay<00:01:03.769> so<00:01:04.460> it

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
ward off implies blocking okay so it

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.120 
ward off implies blocking okay so it
doesn't<00:01:05.000> get<00:01:05.119> to<00:01:05.269> be<00:01:05.420> as<00:01:05.540> soft<00:01:05.869> as<00:01:06.650> everything

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
doesn't get to be as soft as everything

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.219 
doesn't get to be as soft as everything
else<00:01:07.250> until<00:01:07.670> we<00:01:07.729> combine<00:01:08.420> it<00:01:08.630> with<00:01:08.659> everything

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
else until we combine it with everything

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.069 
else until we combine it with everything
else<00:01:09.380> so<00:01:10.189> you<00:01:10.220> know<00:01:10.490> that<00:01:10.759> energy<00:01:11.270> at<00:01:12.049> the

00:01:12.069 --> 00:01:12.079 
else so you know that energy at the

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:15.310 
else so you know that energy at the
image<00:01:12.409> of<00:01:12.530> sky<00:01:13.329> you<00:01:14.329> see<00:01:14.360> this<00:01:14.810> ward<00:01:15.170> off

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
image of sky you see this ward off

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.680 
image of sky you see this ward off
repeat<00:01:16.100> it<00:01:16.220> over<00:01:16.310> and<00:01:16.460> over<00:01:16.610> again<00:01:18.549> cloudy

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:21.690 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:23.590 

sense<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.140> cloud<00:01:22.350> hands<00:01:22.620> and<00:01:22.860> sky

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
sense the cloud hands and sky

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.929 
sense the cloud hands and sky
and<00:01:24.020> so<00:01:24.170> you<00:01:24.229> have<00:01:24.500> this<00:01:24.860> for<00:01:25.490> now<00:01:25.670> it

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
and so you have this for now it

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:28.060 
and so you have this for now it
sometimes<00:01:26.210> would<00:01:26.270> go<00:01:26.420> very<00:01:26.630> very<00:01:26.780> soft<00:01:27.259> but

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
sometimes would go very very soft but

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.090 
sometimes would go very very soft but
that's<00:01:28.280> really<00:01:28.490> us<00:01:28.729> using<00:01:29.240> a<00:01:30.100> different

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
that's really us using a different

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.590 
that's really us using a different
energy<00:01:31.189> total<00:01:31.700> weight<00:01:32.030> to<00:01:32.150> later<00:01:32.299> to<00:01:32.390> talk

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
energy total weight to later to talk

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.260 
energy total weight to later to talk
about<00:01:32.780> it<00:01:33.650> so<00:01:33.830> that<00:01:33.979> we<00:01:34.070> stay<00:01:34.130> focused<00:01:34.400> on<00:01:34.790> on

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
about it so that we stay focused on on

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.300 
about it so that we stay focused on on
our<00:01:35.420> ward<00:01:35.630> off<00:01:35.750> but<00:01:36.290> we<00:01:36.380> might<00:01:36.530> be<00:01:36.680> really<00:01:37.009> soft

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
our ward off but we might be really soft

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.720 
our ward off but we might be really soft
here<00:01:37.990> okay

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:39.730 
here okay

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.020 
here okay
you<00:01:40.270> can<00:01:40.570> think<00:01:41.290> of<00:01:41.620> the<00:01:41.860> young<00:01:42.070> yao<00:01:42.490> energy

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
you can think of the young yao energy

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.230 
you can think of the young yao energy
the<00:01:43.300> ward<00:01:43.660> off<00:01:43.810> energy<00:01:44.280> like<00:01:45.280> trying<00:01:45.910> to<00:01:45.970> sit

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
the ward off energy like trying to sit

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.440 
the ward off energy like trying to sit
on<00:01:46.330> a<00:01:46.360> beach<00:01:46.690> ball<00:01:47.050> when<00:01:47.980> you're<00:01:48.100> a<00:01:48.160> kid<00:01:48.450> right

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
on a beach ball when you're a kid right

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.100 
on a beach ball when you're a kid right
and<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.970> couple<00:01:51.970> images<00:01:52.360> come<00:01:52.600> to<00:01:52.630> mind<00:01:52.720> me<00:01:52.990> that

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
and a couple images come to mind me that

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.390 
and a couple images come to mind me that
but<00:01:53.230> that<00:01:53.350> really<00:01:53.620> that<00:01:53.710> one<00:01:53.890> where<00:01:54.040> you<00:01:54.130> sit

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.400 
but that really that one where you sit

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.970 
but that really that one where you sit
and<00:01:54.610> fall<00:01:54.910> off<00:01:55.120> right<00:01:55.390> away<00:01:55.650> know<00:01:56.650> where<00:01:56.860> you

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:56.980 
and fall off right away know where you

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.350 
and fall off right away know where you
thought<00:01:57.220> you<00:01:57.400> were<00:01:57.490> going<00:01:57.640> to<00:01:57.700> sit<00:01:57.910> on<00:01:57.940> it<00:01:58.180> and

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
thought you were going to sit on it and

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.600 
thought you were going to sit on it and
you<00:01:58.840> fell<00:01:59.110> off<00:01:59.140> it<00:01:59.440> wasn't<00:01:59.680> a<00:01:59.740> slow<00:02:00.070> roll<00:02:00.370> off

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
you fell off it wasn't a slow roll off

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.700 
you fell off it wasn't a slow roll off
it<00:02:01.390> was<00:02:01.540> like<00:02:01.690> you<00:02:01.810> sat<00:02:02.110> on<00:02:02.140> it<00:02:02.410> and<00:02:02.560> it<00:02:02.620> would

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
it was like you sat on it and it would

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.470 
it was like you sat on it and it would
prove<00:02:02.950> it<00:02:03.460> came<00:02:03.730> out<00:02:03.940> from<00:02:04.120> underneath<00:02:04.300> you

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:04.480 
prove it came out from underneath you

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.200 
prove it came out from underneath you
that's<00:02:05.290> how<00:02:05.590> it's<00:02:05.830> used<00:02:06.130> and<00:02:06.520> we<00:02:06.760> did<00:02:06.940> that<00:02:07.060> in

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
that's how it's used and we did that in

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.210 
that's how it's used and we did that in
some<00:02:07.330> of<00:02:07.420> our<00:02:07.510> applications<00:02:07.900> today<00:02:08.470> when<00:02:09.070> we

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
some of our applications today when we

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.760 
some of our applications today when we
brought<00:02:09.880> our<00:02:10.030> arm<00:02:10.270> up<00:02:10.480> and<00:02:10.660> intercept<00:02:11.140> but<00:02:11.680> we

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
brought our arm up and intercept but we

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.160 
brought our arm up and intercept but we
immediately<00:02:12.130> made<00:02:12.370> it<00:02:12.490> into<00:02:12.760> yin<00:02:13.000> energy<00:02:13.170> okay

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
immediately made it into yin energy okay

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.410 
immediately made it into yin energy okay
but<00:02:14.650> almost<00:02:15.130> all<00:02:15.400> of<00:02:15.700> your<00:02:15.760> techniques<00:02:16.210> and

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
but almost all of your techniques and

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.990 
but almost all of your techniques and
Tai<00:02:16.570> Chi<00:02:16.810> begin<00:02:17.260> with<00:02:17.530> the<00:02:17.740> board<00:02:18.640> off<00:02:18.790> energy

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
Tai Chi begin with the board off energy

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.550 
Tai Chi begin with the board off energy
because<00:02:19.660> the<00:02:19.780> ward<00:02:19.990> off<00:02:20.080> energies<00:02:20.440> the

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
because the ward off energies the

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.310 
because the ward off energies the
furthest<00:02:21.040> away<00:02:21.220> protecting<00:02:22.210> the<00:02:22.240> most<00:02:22.540> and<00:02:22.750> it

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
furthest away protecting the most and it

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.830 
furthest away protecting the most and it
has<00:02:23.530> send<00:02:23.860> you<00:02:24.100> can<00:02:24.280> use<00:02:24.460> your<00:02:25.150> feeling<00:02:25.780> you

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
has send you can use your feeling you

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.100 
has send you can use your feeling you
can<00:02:26.020> sense<00:02:26.320> on<00:02:26.590> the<00:02:26.800> surface<00:02:27.100> of<00:02:27.190> your<00:02:27.340> skin

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
can sense on the surface of your skin

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.930 
can sense on the surface of your skin
what's<00:02:29.770> going<00:02:30.010> on<00:02:30.160> and<00:02:30.340> then<00:02:30.430> you<00:02:30.520> can<00:02:30.670> change

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
what's going on and then you can change

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.490 
what's going on and then you can change
it<00:02:31.120> you<00:02:31.180> can<00:02:31.300> release<00:02:31.600> it<00:02:31.630> or<00:02:31.930> keep<00:02:32.080> it<00:02:32.230> firm

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
it you can release it or keep it firm

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.820 
it you can release it or keep it firm
depending<00:02:33.190> on<00:02:33.190> what<00:02:33.460> you<00:02:33.670> what<00:02:34.240> you<00:02:34.270> get<00:02:34.540> from

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
depending on what you what you get from

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.670 
depending on what you what you get from
okay<00:02:35.830> so<00:02:36.310> before<00:02:36.880> we<00:02:37.300> apply<00:02:37.540> this<00:02:37.840> in<00:02:38.260> push<00:02:38.650> in

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
okay so before we apply this in push in

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.070 
okay so before we apply this in push in
because<00:02:39.190> this<00:02:39.280> is<00:02:39.490> you<00:02:40.300> know<00:02:40.390> in<00:02:40.510> Taiji<00:02:40.840> that's

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
because this is you know in Taiji that's

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.370 
because this is you know in Taiji that's
where<00:02:41.290> we<00:02:41.410> can<00:02:42.630> discover<00:02:43.630> the<00:02:43.840> eight<00:02:43.960> energies

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
where we can discover the eight energies

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.740 
where we can discover the eight energies
how<00:02:44.860> to<00:02:44.920> use<00:02:45.160> them<00:02:45.280> to<00:02:45.430> pushing<00:02:45.640> it<00:02:45.850> and<00:02:46.060> then

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
how to use them to pushing it and then

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.080 
how to use them to pushing it and then
they<00:02:46.980> get<00:02:47.980> an<00:02:48.250> infinite<00:02:48.670> number<00:02:48.820> of

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
they get an infinite number of

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.410 
they get an infinite number of
permutations<00:02:50.070> okay<00:02:51.070> we<00:02:51.700> can<00:02:51.850> look<00:02:52.000> at<00:02:52.120> it<00:02:52.180> in<00:02:52.330> a

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
permutations okay we can look at it in a

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.600 
permutations okay we can look at it in a
simple<00:02:52.780> posture<00:02:53.200> like<00:02:53.380> our<00:02:53.650> ward<00:02:54.040> off<00:02:54.130> posture

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
simple posture like our ward off posture

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.030 
simple posture like our ward off posture
or<00:02:54.760> we<00:02:54.850> can<00:02:54.940> look<00:02:55.060> at<00:02:55.209> it<00:02:55.270> and<00:02:55.690> a<00:02:56.260> slightly

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
or we can look at it and a slightly

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.100 
or we can look at it and a slightly
harder<00:02:57.459> posture<00:02:57.790> get<00:02:58.000> it<00:02:58.120> in<00:02:58.270> is<00:02:58.480> embracing

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
harder posture get it in is embracing

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.250 
harder posture get it in is embracing
horse<00:02:59.530> okay<00:03:00.190> so
