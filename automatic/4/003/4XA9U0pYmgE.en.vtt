jungle planks jungle stairs and jungle
slabs<00:00:32.340> I<00:00:32.579> assume<00:00:32.880> I'll<00:00:33.120> see<00:00:33.329> why<00:00:33.480> they

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
slabs I assume I'll see why they

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.600 
slabs I assume I'll see why they
wouldn't<00:00:33.930> but<00:00:34.350> I<00:00:34.380> didn't<00:00:35.100> see<00:00:35.250> them<00:00:35.309> in<00:00:35.489> the

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
wouldn't but I didn't see them in the

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.920 
wouldn't but I didn't see them in the
picture<00:00:35.940> but<00:00:36.120> if<00:00:36.450> they're<00:00:36.690> going<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:36.870> do

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
picture but if they're going to do

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.479 
picture but if they're going to do
stairs<00:00:37.230> they<00:00:37.410> might<00:00:37.559> as<00:00:37.649> well<00:00:37.770> do<00:00:37.860> slab<00:00:38.129> so<00:00:38.399> I'm

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
stairs they might as well do slab so I'm

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.250 
stairs they might as well do slab so I'm
pretty<00:00:38.820> sure<00:00:39.120> they're<00:00:39.600> going<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:39.780> do<00:00:39.930> that<00:00:40.110> out

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
pretty sure they're going to do that out

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.110 
pretty sure they're going to do that out
see<00:00:40.469> why<00:00:40.590> they<00:00:40.739> would<00:00:40.860> not<00:00:41.059> upside<00:00:42.059> down

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
see why they would not upside down

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.840 
see why they would not upside down
stairs<00:00:42.629> I've<00:00:43.079> now<00:00:43.320> upside<00:00:43.890> down<00:00:44.070> half<00:00:44.489> slabs

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
stairs I've now upside down half slabs

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.150 
stairs I've now upside down half slabs
such<00:00:45.239> pretty<00:00:45.510> awesome<00:00:45.899> redstone<00:00:46.739> lamps

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
such pretty awesome redstone lamps

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.000 
such pretty awesome redstone lamps
ocelots<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.210> iron<00:00:48.750> golems<00:00:49.350> as<00:00:49.500> you<00:00:49.649> can<00:00:49.800> see

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
ocelots and iron golems as you can see

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.889 
ocelots and iron golems as you can see
in<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.460> picture<00:00:50.670> so<00:00:51.329> that<00:00:51.360> that<00:00:51.750> is<00:00:51.870> really

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
in the picture so that that is really

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.080 
in the picture so that that is really
cool<00:00:52.170> I<00:00:52.410> think<00:00:52.590> there'd<00:00:52.890> be<00:00:52.980> some<00:00:53.550> interesting

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
cool I think there'd be some interesting

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.220 
cool I think there'd be some interesting

it<00:03:46.709> was<00:03:46.770> that<00:03:46.830> important<00:03:47.370> but<00:03:47.400> now<00:03:47.610> that<00:03:47.820> 3d

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
it was that important but now that 3d

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.210 
it was that important but now that 3d
effect<00:03:48.690> is<00:03:48.840> coming<00:03:49.140> into<00:03:49.260> the<00:03:49.410> game<00:03:49.560> I've<00:03:50.010> been

feeling<00:03:50.400> this<00:03:50.670> might<00:03:50.940> interfere<00:03:51.270> with<00:03:51.510> it<00:03:52.200> I'm

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
texture glitch in the game and they can

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.710 
texture glitch in the game and they can
add<00:04:16.650> a<00:04:16.680> fixed<00:04:17.190> so<00:04:17.310> the<00:04:17.430> 3d<00:04:17.760> effect<00:04:17.790> doesn't
