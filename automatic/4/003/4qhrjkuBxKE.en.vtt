00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.649
 lately there has been a very video 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.349

 Juan is a video recorded in June in 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.160
 June of this year and I would like 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.800
 let's put the images at the beginning the 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.410
 send a greeting and then your video has 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:27.390
 audio if we can put it please say 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:32.629
 tijuana 1 my name is manuel huerta los 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:34.739
 40 years here we will continue investigating more 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:36.269
 participating with our partners in 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.690
 the tables 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:38.690
 Thank you 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.450
 although there is no vision gain 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.600
 girls as it was done seen as the 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:54.600
 saucer 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:01.250
 and someone has to be recording 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:09.620
 if it stabilizes or not 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.390
 the same altitude the same height 7 and 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.930
 this is a place we can record the 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.490
 lights 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.490
 in fact here in fact the commas 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.330
 good this video that has our 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.330
 points of reference 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:33.510
 if you pressuring the truth of 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.410
 Tijuana airport to the airport 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:41.030
 San Diego there is very little distance and there 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.030
 a military base in san diego de tijuana 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:48.090
 and which side of tijuana was he on 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.500
 recording from the center of tijuana to me 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.180
 what strikes me as I know 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.370
 I said yesterday yesterday he had a conversation with 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.830
 manuel orchard that I send many 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.900
 greetings equaled his friend camacho a 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.940
 marko camacho is not is not of these 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:03.420
 zeppelin who are taking care of the border 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:06.780
 not because it does not have a basket 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.850
 size and because it remains fixed many 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.979
 minutes sector this is an edition of the 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.840
 video the full video 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.670
 in what ends what happens with the object 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.890
 now they will see the next image is 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.930
 the way he stops seeing it is 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.480
 begins to lose behind a roof of 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.730
 a construction and manuel tells me that 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.920
 seem headed towards the sea towards 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.470
 rosarito this is the way in which 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.690
 let 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:32.770
 it's very interesting also it turns out that 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.390
 your neighbor records it with another camera and is 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.750
 other evidence that we obviously have 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.940
 of the same object the same manuel comments 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.010
 that could make a device 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.960
 military issues some kind of 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.750
 patrolling for example is what I think 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.970
 to stop but for the border there is 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.010
 I'm going to do what's good for me 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.550
 as it remains fixed look at me a way 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.800
 strange 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.230
 he would not call me so much attention if 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.150
 it is not accompanied by a rare evolution 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.610
 to delete an object is 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.490
 completely said so many minutes both 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.980
 time if we put video number two 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:09.459
 please let's see this video that 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:12.000
 She recorded her neighbor where has the time 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:14.090
 here it is 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.250
 dallas 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.250
 in fact we know him we did the 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:21.090
 comparative but we do not seem to be the 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.310
 zeppelin 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.739
 and above all that you want quietecito 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.200
 that I mention to you that I also mention what 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:31.260
 Measures 3 meters good he calculates 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:34.200
 which are approximately 3 meters and as 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.849
 he himself commented it because it is a UFO in 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.610
 the strict sense because we have not yet 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:41.190
 identified what it's about Ã¡lex you what 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.080
 you think of this type of artifacts that 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.420
 look at the border or too near 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:49.049
 military bases good what happens is that 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:52.379
 there are extraterrestrial races called 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:54.900
 dark ones that are somehow very 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:59.220
 near the military bases why 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.810
 reason we assume or know that they have a 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.730
 open contact with our 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.410
 rulers to me I do not know I do not know 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.049
 I have seen this because I have 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:11.310
 communicated and when they pass like that the UFOs 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:14.489
 so slow is because they perceive 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:16.859
 the people who are in the radius of 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:18.389
 double I do not know if I explain 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:20.329
 the UFO has a certain reach 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:23.130
 energetic like our radar 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:25.110
 exactly and perceive what surrounds them 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.120
 what is it that they are 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.600
 perceiving if there are people who can 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.610
 perceive 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.590
 that you can see that you can hear them or 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.270
 that you can feel that is very normal 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.160
 but notice that it is a doubt that I have 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.380
 for a long time when we know of 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.840
 UFOs near military bases the common 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.430
 is to think good is a military apparatus of 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.710
 espionage or that has not been disclosed 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:46.350
 but I think it's not in all cases 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.880
 some may be UFOs but they have already 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:51.690
 seen the answer because they approach 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:53.280
 the military bases if by that treaty or 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:55.830
 way they have to operate with our 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.320
 rulers including the military by 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.210
 that look close to it usually 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.160
 you can now mention what 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.840
 have said on other occasions for me is 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.790
 omni to this day until all 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.530
 we continue investigating the ways that 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:09.570
 an object has appeared there does not want 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:11.730
 say come from another planet or that 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:15.150
 be simple look at another planet no longer 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:17.700
 they are and the identified assailant useful is 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.770
 something is something very very very strange and that 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:22.260
 the mine keeps coming up that maybe 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.670
 There are already ways to take care of the border without 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.530
 have the chance of what there is 

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:27.180
 several ways of caring for the border without 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.370
 However, these people have many 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.480
 years living on the border they would know 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.920
 What is it about 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.919
 It was one of the questions I asked him 

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:36.180
 what to download 

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:38.250
 well that's why I'm telling you that we're still 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.800
 investigating both the one called 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:43.050
 Manuel Huerta as his friend who is Marco 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.360
 camacho they are also forming 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:47.130
 a research group in tijuana 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.410
 If you want to join them, enter 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:51.389
 youtube channel that was 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:53.700
 labeled in the videos or write and I 

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:56.430
 I gladly give you data from Manuel 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:58.530
 What else can you tell us is now from 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:01.139
 UFOs and seen in the borders has 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:03.540
 some some meaning especially if 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:05.460
 It is very well known among the people who live 

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:07.860
 this experience with extraterrestrials 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:09.780
 as we call them here 

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:13.949
 that on the northern border of our country 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:15.210
 there is a lot of influence of dark races and 

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:18.090
 why I do not know it but 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:20.699
 obviously I say myself personally 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:23.460
 I can say that if we who 

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:25.500
 we are simple citizen people we notice 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:27.750
 these phenomena that will not know the 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:29.370
 military for example not then says 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:31.379
 that the entire northern border of our 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:35.509
 country is influenced by races 

00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:39.360
 dark ones that somehow take 

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:42.029
 natural waste and minerals 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:44.490
 planet so that for your personal use 

00:06:42.029 --> 00:06:47.250
 because on this planet earth has a 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:49.710
 feature there are many minerals like 

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:51.930
 that come from many sides us 

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:53.340
 we see it as very common but they in their 

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:55.560
 star of origin on your planet of 

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:58.529
 origin is not not true the abundance that 

00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:01.169
 has this planet in products that 

00:06:58.529 --> 00:07:04.469
 they end up in minerals 

00:07:01.169 --> 00:07:07.949
 It is very vast and once in all 

00:07:04.469 --> 00:07:11.009
 planets in the twelfth planet is charged 

00:07:07.949 --> 00:07:14.370
 without that, they suggest that 

00:07:11.009 --> 00:07:17.129
 establish in Mesopotamia and travel towards 

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:19.430
 Africa for the first mines to 

00:07:17.129 --> 00:07:21.479
 dig and have gold because your planet 

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:23.849
 supposedly needed was created 

00:07:21.479 --> 00:07:25.499
 an atmosphere and the real gold covered in the 

00:07:23.849 --> 00:07:28.800
 protected and apart the gold has a 

00:07:25.499 --> 00:07:30.599
 particularity in fact here is monopolized 

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:33.569
 the gold not for its value but because the 

00:07:30.599 --> 00:07:35.580
 gold is a mineral of which it is a transmitter 

00:07:33.569 --> 00:07:38.820
 that's why the Indians the Indians lived 

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:41.430
 with gold next to their cities 

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:43.290
 your conference on Saturday five of the 

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:44.700
 late Roman colony 

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:47.130
