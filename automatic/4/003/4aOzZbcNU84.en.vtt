00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:16.480 
to but basically all you got to do like
I<00:06:14.960> was<00:06:15.170> saying<00:06:15.320> before<00:06:15.380> is<00:06:15.740> go<00:06:15.950> in<00:06:16.130> and<00:06:16.160> just

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:16.490 
I was saying before is go in and just

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.230 
I was saying before is go in and just
use<00:06:17.000> the<00:06:17.150> same<00:06:17.390> file<00:06:17.780> which<00:06:18.560> is<00:06:18.590> going<00:06:18.830> to<00:06:18.890> be

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:19.240 
use the same file which is going to be

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.270 
use the same file which is going to be
under<00:06:20.240> each<00:06:20.420> one<00:06:20.660> of<00:06:20.690> these<00:06:20.840> mods<00:06:21.140> and<00:06:21.530> you<00:06:22.100> can

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:22.280 
under each one of these mods and you can

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.370 
under each one of these mods and you can
change<00:06:22.610> the<00:06:22.970> price<00:06:23.210> on<00:06:23.540> there<00:06:23.900> as<00:06:23.960> well<00:06:23.990> but

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:24.380 
change the price on there as well but

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.670 
change the price on there as well but
anyway<00:06:24.740> the<00:06:24.950> not<00:06:25.520> all<00:06:25.760> these<00:06:26.030> work<00:06:26.360> i<00:06:27.260> would

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:27.680 
anyway the not all these work i would

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:32.990 
anyway the not all these work i would
say<00:06:28.090> fifty<00:06:29.090> percent<00:06:29.620> work<00:06:30.620> the<00:06:31.490> first<00:06:31.790> time

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:33.000 
say fifty percent work the first time

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.890 
say fifty percent work the first time
if<00:06:34.000> they<00:06:34.180> don't<00:06:34.360> work<00:06:34.450> the<00:06:34.600> first<00:06:34.810> time

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:34.900 
if they don't work the first time

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.600 
if they don't work the first time
chances<00:06:35.410> are<00:06:35.500> they<00:06:35.620> will<00:06:35.710> not<00:06:35.890> work<00:06:36.130> on<00:06:36.310> with

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:36.610 
chances are they will not work on with
