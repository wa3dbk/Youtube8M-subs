probes<00:03:35.189> getting<00:03:35.519> stuck<00:03:35.699> in<00:03:35.819> there<00:03:35.939> without<00:03:36.060> to

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
probes getting stuck in there without to

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.319 
probes getting stuck in there without to
probe<00:03:36.840> 22<00:03:37.169> or<00:03:38.040> two<00:03:38.159> probes<00:03:38.370> at<00:03:38.549> two<00:03:38.669> protection

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
probe 22 or two probes at two protection

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:42.740 
probe 22 or two probes at two protection
actually<00:03:40.169> good<00:03:40.530> damage<00:03:40.889> down<00:03:41.069> there<00:03:41.750> very

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
actually good damage down there very

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:44.929 
actually good damage down there very
nice<00:03:42.900> a<00:03:42.930> little<00:03:43.169> bit<00:03:43.259> of<00:03:43.349> Mannering<00:03:43.859> by<00:03:44.220> snow

00:03:44.929 --> 00:03:44.939 
nice a little bit of Mannering by snow

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:45.890 
nice a little bit of Mannering by snow
there's<00:03:45.180> gonna<00:03:45.299> be<00:03:45.419> four<00:03:45.509> to<00:03:45.599> take<00:03:45.720> that<00:03:45.840> out

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
there's gonna be four to take that out

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.199 
there's gonna be four to take that out
yes<00:03:46.169> a<00:03:46.349> kalalau<00:03:47.040> has<00:03:47.280> two<00:03:47.579> solids<00:03:47.879> ready<00:03:48.120> at

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
yes a kalalau has two solids ready at

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:49.520 
yes a kalalau has two solids ready at
the<00:03:48.269> ready<00:03:48.449> and<00:03:48.599> you<00:03:48.659> just<00:03:48.810> focus<00:03:49.019> far<00:03:49.349> as<00:03:49.409> that

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
the ready and you just focus far as that

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.229 
the ready and you just focus far as that
down<00:03:49.650> pretty<00:03:49.799> quickly<00:03:50.069> so<00:03:50.370> the<00:03:50.879> damage

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
down pretty quickly so the damage

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:52.969 
down pretty quickly so the damage
doesn't<00:03:52.079> stay<00:03:52.290> for<00:03:52.470> too<00:03:52.590> long<00:03:52.709> I'm<00:03:52.859> actually

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:52.979 
doesn't stay for too long I'm actually

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:54.979 
doesn't stay for too long I'm actually
wondering<00:03:53.189> whether<00:03:53.579> you<00:03:53.759> know<00:03:53.879> 100<00:03:54.689> minerals

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
wondering whether you know 100 minerals

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:56.509 
wondering whether you know 100 minerals
is<00:03:55.049> not<00:03:55.199> going<00:03:55.349> to<00:03:55.409> get<00:03:55.530> back<00:03:55.709> but<00:03:55.919> that<00:03:56.069> matter

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
is not going to get back but that matter

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.159 
is not going to get back but that matter
phone<00:03:56.669> was<00:03:56.790> taken<00:03:56.849> up<00:03:57.030> very<00:03:57.180> quickly<00:03:57.299> range

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:58.169 
phone was taken up very quickly range

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:00.289 
phone was taken up very quickly range
being<00:03:58.409> operated<00:03:58.650> for<00:03:58.799> Cal<00:03:59.069> at<00:03:59.220> this<00:03:59.370> point<00:03:59.639> so

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
being operated for Cal at this point so

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.059 
being operated for Cal at this point so
probably<00:04:01.109> gonna<00:04:01.229> be<00:04:01.319> seeing<00:04:01.590> the<00:04:01.680> second

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
probably gonna be seeing the second

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:04.009 
probably gonna be seeing the second
gateway<00:04:02.280> variation<00:04:02.669> unless<00:04:03.569> you<00:04:03.720> decide<00:04:03.989> to

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
gateway variation unless you decide to

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:05.809 
gateway variation unless you decide to
go<00:04:04.169> quick<00:04:04.379> tech<00:04:04.590> but<00:04:04.829> I'm<00:04:04.919> thinking<00:04:05.609> that<00:04:05.699> with

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:05.819 
go quick tech but I'm thinking that with

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:08.300 
go quick tech but I'm thinking that with
that<00:04:05.909> initial<00:04:06.419> very<00:04:06.780> quick<00:04:07.199> upgrade<00:04:07.470> to<00:04:08.040> range

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
that initial very quick upgrade to range

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.490 
that initial very quick upgrade to range
polly<00:04:08.609> knocking<00:04:08.819> about<00:04:09.060> the<00:04:09.150> case<00:04:09.379> yeah<00:04:10.379> he

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
polly knocking about the case yeah he

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.170 
polly knocking about the case yeah he
might<00:04:10.620> actually<00:04:10.680> cancel<00:04:11.489> it<00:04:11.579> after<00:04:11.699> some<00:04:12.000> time

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
might actually cancel it after some time

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.309 
might actually cancel it after some time
you<00:04:12.239> know<00:04:12.359> after<00:04:12.629> she<00:04:12.900> takes<00:04:13.049> down<00:04:13.290> the

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
you know after she takes down the

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:15.589 
you know after she takes down the
scouting<00:04:13.799> book<00:04:13.979> we<00:04:14.790> can<00:04:14.819> we<00:04:15.180> have<00:04:15.389> seen

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:15.599 
scouting book we can we have seen

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:17.210 
scouting book we can we have seen
players<00:04:15.900> to<00:04:16.169> that<00:04:16.349> before<00:04:16.620> you<00:04:16.739> know<00:04:16.829> to<00:04:16.889> just

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
players to that before you know to just

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.879 
players to that before you know to just
throw<00:04:17.820> the<00:04:18.060> no<00:04:18.750> throw<00:04:19.139> the<00:04:19.289> other<00:04:19.409> player<00:04:19.769> of

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
throw the no throw the other player of

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:21.800 
throw the no throw the other player of
card<00:04:20.159> he's<00:04:20.340> like<00:04:20.519> thinking<00:04:20.849> oh<00:04:21.090> he's<00:04:21.570> going

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
card he's like thinking oh he's going

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.480 
card he's like thinking oh he's going
for<00:04:21.989> the<00:04:22.049> gun<00:04:22.349> range<00:04:22.560> so<00:04:22.800> I'm<00:04:23.010> just<00:04:23.219> going<00:04:23.400> to

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
for the gun range so I'm just going to

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.430 
for the gun range so I'm just going to
go<00:04:23.669> for<00:04:23.969> an<00:04:24.330> expansion<00:04:24.810> or<00:04:25.050> something<00:04:25.349> like

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
go for an expansion or something like

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.440 
go for an expansion or something like
that<00:04:25.500> I<00:04:25.650> don't<00:04:25.889> know

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 
that I don't know

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
and we just see quick tech from the

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.170 
and we just see quick tech from the
other<00:04:29.000> player<00:04:29.270> and<00:04:29.480> and<00:04:30.730> actually<00:04:31.730> Cal<00:04:31.910> going

other player and and actually Cal going
for<00:04:32.390> a<00:04:32.420> robo<00:04:33.970> I'm<00:04:34.970> gonna<00:04:35.150> go<00:04:35.270> for<00:04:35.450> a<00:04:35.480> robotics

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
for a robo I'm gonna go for a robotics

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.540 
for a robo I'm gonna go for a robotics
facility<00:04:36.020> so<00:04:36.530> he's<00:04:36.710> gonna<00:04:36.860> go<00:04:37.040> quick<00:04:37.250> griever

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
just very good old standard TVP I saw a

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.010 
just very good old standard TVP I saw a
bit<00:04:40.370> of<00:04:40.460> a<00:04:40.520> change<00:04:40.910> in<00:04:41.270> the<00:04:41.420> game<00:04:41.600> a<00:04:41.720> few<00:04:41.900> months

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
bit of a change in the game a few months

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.750 
bit of a change in the game a few months
ago<00:04:42.170> that<00:04:42.410> didn't<00:04:42.620> last<00:04:42.770> very<00:04:43.100> long<00:04:43.340> players

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
ago that didn't last very long players

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.090 
ago that didn't last very long players
could<00:04:43.970> kind<00:04:44.150> of<00:04:44.210> tended<00:04:44.510> to<00:04:44.600> go<00:04:44.750> more<00:04:45.590> zealot

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
could kind of tended to go more zealot

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.090 
could kind of tended to go more zealot

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
more gateway heavy think I saw him put

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.120 
more gateway heavy think I saw him put

moving out a little bit thinking of

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.580 
moving out a little bit thinking of
possibly<00:05:08.390> putting<00:05:08.750> up<00:05:08.870> an<00:05:08.960> expansion<00:05:09.440> both

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
possibly putting up an expansion both

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.350 
possibly putting up an expansion both
person<00:05:09.860> playing<00:05:10.370> very<00:05:10.610> much<00:05:10.790> alike<00:05:11.060> at<00:05:11.240> this

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 
person playing very much alike at this

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.820 
person playing very much alike at this
point<00:05:11.660> though<00:05:11.780> going<00:05:12.020> for<00:05:12.230> range<00:05:12.410> so<00:05:12.620> this<00:05:12.770> is

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
point though going for range so this is

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.560 
point though going for range so this is
going<00:05:12.950> to<00:05:13.010> be<00:05:13.100> just<00:05:13.190> a<00:05:13.310> good<00:05:13.460> old<00:05:13.550> standard<00:05:14.030> pvp

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
going to be just a good old standard pvp

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.470 
going to be just a good old standard pvp
just<00:05:15.050> gonna<00:05:15.140> come<00:05:15.380> down<00:05:15.530> to<00:05:15.590> not<00:05:16.580> losing<00:05:17.390> your

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:17.480 
just gonna come down to not losing your

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.370 
just gonna come down to not losing your
river<00:05:17.840> by<00:05:18.110> being<00:05:18.320> silly<00:05:19.090> yeah<00:05:20.090> or<00:05:20.630> not<00:05:21.050> losing

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.380 
river by being silly yeah or not losing

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.350 
river by being silly yeah or not losing
your<00:05:21.470> shuttle<00:05:22.040> with<00:05:22.310> the<00:05:22.430> river<00:05:22.730> which<00:05:23.180> is

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
your shuttle with the river which is

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.140 
your shuttle with the river which is
still<00:05:23.660> worse<00:05:24.160> but<00:05:25.160> yeah<00:05:25.340> it's<00:05:25.790> pretty<00:05:26.000> much

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
still worse but yeah it's pretty much

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:27.640 
still worse but yeah it's pretty much
going<00:05:26.390> to<00:05:26.480> come<00:05:26.690> down<00:05:26.870> to<00:05:26.930> micro<00:05:27.350> management

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
going to come down to micro management

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:29.890 
going to come down to micro management
and<00:05:27.980> and<00:05:28.220> this<00:05:28.550> kind<00:05:28.760> of<00:05:28.940> you<00:05:29.180> know<00:05:29.300> situation

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:29.900 
and and this kind of you know situation

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.840 
and and this kind of you know situation
I<00:05:29.960> think<00:05:29.990> that<00:05:30.290> Cal<00:05:30.500> is<00:05:30.530> no<00:05:31.370> he<00:05:31.520> has<00:05:31.670> more

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:31.850 
I think that Cal is no he has more

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:33.460 
I think that Cal is no he has more
experience<00:05:32.180> he<00:05:32.420> has<00:05:32.900> been<00:05:33.110> under<00:05:33.410> stress

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:33.470 
experience he has been under stress

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:37.480 
experience he has been under stress
before<00:05:34.010> and<00:05:34.780> just<00:05:35.780> something<00:05:36.620> that<00:05:36.800> he<00:05:37.370> would

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 
before and just something that he would

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:40.150 
before and just something that he would
naturally<00:05:38.090> have<00:05:38.210> an<00:05:38.360> advantage<00:05:38.660> at<00:05:39.020> but<00:05:40.010> you

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:40.160 
naturally have an advantage at but you

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.740 
naturally have an advantage at but you
know<00:05:40.250> then<00:05:40.430> again<00:05:40.670> it<00:05:40.790> so<00:05:41.060> it<00:05:41.360> all<00:05:41.540> will<00:05:41.720> come

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750 
know then again it so it all will come

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.540 
know then again it so it all will come
down<00:05:42.110> to<00:05:42.140> micro<00:05:42.620> and<00:05:42.770> some<00:05:42.950> player<00:05:43.190> might<00:05:43.370> get

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:43.550 
down to micro and some player might get

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:46.150 
down to micro and some player might get
lucky<00:05:43.790> which<00:05:44.150> is<00:05:44.300> a<00:05:44.720> reverse<00:05:45.500> other<00:05:45.830> player

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:46.160 
lucky which is a reverse other player

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.250 
lucky which is a reverse other player
other<00:05:46.490> player<00:05:46.910> might<00:05:47.150> get<00:05:47.480> lucky<00:05:47.630> was<00:05:47.870> taking

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:48.260 
other player might get lucky was taking

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.770 
other player might get lucky was taking
down<00:05:48.440> an<00:05:48.650> enemy<00:05:48.770> reverse<00:05:49.300> so<00:05:50.300> going<00:05:50.510> to<00:05:50.630> come

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:50.780 
down an enemy reverse so going to come

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.220 
down an enemy reverse so going to come
down<00:05:50.930> to<00:05:51.110> that<00:05:51.140> and<00:05:51.500> we<00:05:52.570> yeah<00:05:53.570> both<00:05:54.020> players

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:54.230 
down to that and we yeah both players

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:56.380 
down to that and we yeah both players
going<00:05:54.530> for<00:05:54.830> the<00:05:54.980> robotic<00:05:55.880> support<00:05:56.270> before

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:56.390 
going for the robotic support before

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:58.300 
going for the robotic support before
observers<00:05:56.930> so<00:05:57.170> it's<00:05:57.500> going<00:05:57.680> to<00:05:57.950> be<00:05:58.100> pretty

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:58.310 
observers so it's going to be pretty

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.720 
observers so it's going to be pretty
much<00:05:58.550> old<00:05:58.730> school<00:05:59.000> pvp<00:05:59.540> one<00:06:00.440> base<00:06:00.730> wheelers

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:01.730 
much old school pvp one base wheelers

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:03.520 
much old school pvp one base wheelers
yeah<00:06:02.480> I<00:06:02.510> mentioned<00:06:02.930> this<00:06:02.990> before<00:06:03.140> but<00:06:03.320> just

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:03.530 
yeah I mentioned this before but just

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:04.750 
yeah I mentioned this before but just
found<00:06:03.800> out<00:06:03.920> the<00:06:04.010> other<00:06:04.040> day<00:06:04.220> that<00:06:04.430> it<00:06:04.550> actually

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:04.760 
found out the other day that it actually

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.530 
found out the other day that it actually
is<00:06:05.120> called<00:06:05.480> a<00:06:05.630> robotics<00:06:06.200> support<00:06:07.070> babe<00:06:07.700> just

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:08.540 
is called a robotics support babe just

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:10.570 
is called a robotics support babe just
the<00:06:08.810> word<00:06:09.050> Bay<00:06:09.380> can't<00:06:09.860> actually<00:06:10.070> fit<00:06:10.460> in<00:06:10.520> the

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:10.580 
the word Bay can't actually fit in the

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:11.650 
the word Bay can't actually fit in the
description<00:06:10.970> but<00:06:11.060> now<00:06:11.270> there's<00:06:11.450> going<00:06:11.480> to<00:06:11.630> be

forces up the left and i'm not quite

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:25.930 
forces up the left and i'm not quite
sure<00:06:24.650> where<00:06:25.310> they<00:06:25.430> has<00:06:25.520> enough<00:06:25.730> forces

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:25.940

there<00:06:28.460> might<00:06:28.700> even<00:06:28.850> lose<00:06:29.060> that<00:06:29.300> one<00:06:29.480> that<00:06:29.660> is

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:29.690 
there might even lose that one that is

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:31.270 
there might even lose that one that is
running<00:06:29.990> towards<00:06:30.230> the<00:06:30.380> north<00:06:30.650> so<00:06:31.130> a<00:06:31.160> little

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:31.280 
running towards the north so a little

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.380 
running towards the north so a little
bit<00:06:31.400> of<00:06:31.460> pressure<00:06:31.610> that<00:06:31.730> by<00:06:31.940> snow<00:06:32.150> but<00:06:32.180> the

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:32.390 
bit of pressure that by snow but the

bit of pressure that by snow but the
thing<00:06:32.600> is<00:06:32.630> that<00:06:32.750> Cal<00:06:33.050> has<00:06:33.080> a<00:06:33.230> much<00:06:33.530> sugar

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:33.860 
thing is that Cal has a much sugar

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.410 
thing is that Cal has a much sugar

resupply route at this point is quite
that<00:06:35.540> taking<00:06:35.840> some<00:06:35.960> early<00:06:36.200> damage<00:06:36.380> should<00:06:36.950> be

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:37.100

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.470 
that taking some early damage should be
able<00:06:37.160> to<00:06:37.340> hold<00:06:37.490> this<00:06:37.640> back<00:06:37.850> at<00:06:38.030> least<00:06:38.210> for<00:06:38.390> now

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:39.480 
able to hold this back at least for now

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.580 
able to hold this back at least for now
and<00:06:40.480> actually<00:06:40.660> could<00:06:40.870> move<00:06:40.990> his<00:06:41.080> room<00:06:41.350> back

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:41.590 
and actually could move his room back

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:43.500 
and actually could move his room back
down<00:06:42.070> into<00:06:42.340> a<00:06:42.490> safe<00:06:42.730> position<00:06:42.850> just<00:06:43.270> because

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:43.510 
down into a safe position just because

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:45.990 
down into a safe position just because
of<00:06:43.660> how<00:06:44.250> total<00:06:45.400> position<00:06:45.760> kind<00:06:45.910> of

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:46.000 
of how total position kind of

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.910 
of how total position kind of
looped<00:06:46.180> you<00:06:46.300> have<00:06:46.480> a<00:06:46.510> way<00:06:46.750> two<00:06:47.170> ways<00:06:47.440> so<00:06:47.680> he<00:06:47.770> can

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:47.920 
looped you have a way two ways so he can

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.470 
looped you have a way two ways so he can
actually<00:06:48.160> get<00:06:48.370> it<00:06:48.490> to<00:06:48.580> safely<00:06:48.850> both<00:06:49.030> purse<00:06:49.240> and

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:49.480 
actually get it to safely both purse and

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.760 
actually get it to safely both purse and
now<00:06:49.540> have<00:06:49.690> the<00:06:49.780> river<00:06:49.960> out<00:06:50.110> and<00:06:50.290> yeah<00:06:50.500> as<00:06:50.650> I<00:06:50.740> was

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:50.770 
now have the river out and yeah as I was

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:52.380 
now have the river out and yeah as I was
saying<00:06:51.070> observatories<00:06:51.580> you<00:06:52.090> go<00:06:52.240> down

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:52.390 
saying observatories you go down

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:54.090 
saying observatories you go down
alongside<00:06:52.630> I<00:06:52.840> was<00:06:53.080> always<00:06:53.260> saying<00:06:53.470> it<00:06:53.650> is

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:54.100 
alongside I was always saying it is

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:55.860 
alongside I was always saying it is
actually<00:06:54.580> called<00:06:54.910> a<00:06:55.060> robotics<00:06:55.390> to<00:06:55.450> support

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:55.870 
actually called a robotics to support

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:58.650 
actually called a robotics to support
eBay<00:06:56.490> according<00:06:57.490> to<00:06:57.520> basically<00:06:57.970> all<00:06:58.180> info

you<00:07:05.470> know<00:07:05.590> shorter<00:07:06.040> more<00:07:06.220> comfortable<00:07:06.700> to<00:07:06.820> say

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:07.000 
you know shorter more comfortable to say

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.240 
you know shorter more comfortable to say

robotic support robotics support weight

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:11.850 
robotic support robotics support weight
just<00:07:09.580> takes<00:07:09.790> one<00:07:10.030> more<00:07:10.240> second<00:07:10.600> to<00:07:10.690> say<00:07:10.860> less

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:11.860 
just takes one more second to say less

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:14.160 
just takes one more second to say less
comfortable<00:07:12.400> but<00:07:13.000> now<00:07:13.150> actually<00:07:13.780> calc<00:07:13.990> has<00:07:14.140> a

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:14.170 
comfortable but now actually calc has a

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:17.070 
comfortable but now actually calc has a
Reaver<00:07:14.440> up<00:07:14.680> front<00:07:14.950> and<00:07:15.100> so<00:07:15.340> does<00:07:15.520> so<00:07:16.180> so<00:07:16.870> does

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:17.080 
Reaver up front and so does so so does

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.410 
Reaver up front and so does so so does
snow<00:07:17.410> demands<00:07:18.100> his<00:07:18.220> river<00:07:18.520> and<00:07:18.760> hidden<00:07:19.300> with

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:19.420 
snow demands his river and hidden with

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:22.470 
snow demands his river and hidden with
some<00:07:19.780> nice<00:07:19.990> scare<00:07:20.320> but<00:07:20.500> he<00:07:20.680> loses<00:07:21.400> us<00:07:21.550> both<00:07:22.240> his

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:22.480 
some nice scare but he loses us both his

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.600 
some nice scare but he loses us both his
river<00:07:22.750> and<00:07:22.990> the<00:07:23.050> shuttle<00:07:23.260> so<00:07:24.070> he's<00:07:24.310> going<00:07:24.520> to

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:24.610 
river and the shuttle so he's going to

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:26.820 
river and the shuttle so he's going to
be<00:07:24.760> forced<00:07:25.000> to<00:07:25.090> move<00:07:25.270> back<00:07:25.330> at<00:07:25.930> the<00:07:26.440> very<00:07:26.650> least
