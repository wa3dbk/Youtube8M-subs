00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
fairly quickly and he's got a couple

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.619 
fairly quickly and he's got a couple
bunkers<00:00:02.460> in<00:00:02.490> the<00:00:02.669> front<00:00:02.939> so<00:00:03.149> he's<00:00:03.389> doing

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
bunkers in the front so he's doing

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:05.329 
bunkers in the front so he's doing
pretty<00:00:03.659> well<00:00:03.899> economically<00:00:04.589> and<00:00:04.859> if<00:00:05.220> we

what what just happened there was TLO
also<00:00:21.810> did<00:00:21.990> an<00:00:22.140> exact<00:00:22.500> same<00:00:22.710> drop<00:00:23.070> with<00:00:23.340> for

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
also did an exact same drop with for

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.970 
also did an exact same drop with for
Marauders<00:00:23.880> and<00:00:24.390> he<00:00:24.779> actually<00:00:24.960> tried<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.560> stem

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
Marauders and he actually tried to stem

Marauders and he actually tried to stem
and<00:00:26.010> focus<00:00:26.580> down<00:00:26.699> that<00:00:26.939> spire<00:00:27.210> as<00:00:27.420> it<00:00:27.539> was

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
and focus down that spire as it was

and focus down that spire as it was
making<00:00:27.990> it<00:00:28.230> was<00:00:28.439> down<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:28.740> about<00:00:28.980> 60<00:00:29.760> HP

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
making it was down to about 60 HP

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.749 
making it was down to about 60 HP
considering<00:00:30.810> they<00:00:30.900> have<00:00:31.019> 600<00:00:31.769> hp<00:00:32.160> it<00:00:32.610> was

considering they have 600 hp it was

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.190 
considering they have 600 hp it was
really<00:00:33.120> close<00:00:33.360> but<00:00:33.540> that's<00:00:33.690> not<00:00:33.809> gonna<00:00:33.960> slow

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
really close but that's not gonna slow

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.910 
here but Mutis against to Terran can be
really<00:00:38.640> hard<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:38.879> pull<00:00:39.090> off<00:00:39.239> I<00:00:39.680> think<00:00:40.680> so

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
really hard to pull off I think so

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.950 
really hard to pull off I think so
because<00:00:41.129> if<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:41.610> go<00:00:41.640> with<00:00:42.090> Matt's<00:00:42.360> medalists

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
because if you go with Matt's medalists

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.690 
because if you go with Matt's medalists

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
speedlings good night Marauders I think

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.679 
speedlings good night Marauders I think
he<00:01:17.340> was<00:01:17.400> trying<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.729> snipe<00:01:17.939> that<00:01:18.000> Queen<00:01:18.450> there

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.090 
he was trying to snipe that Queen there
it<00:01:18.780> was<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:18.960> couple<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.320> shots<00:01:19.500> away<00:01:19.650> from<00:01:19.890> death

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
it was a couple of shots away from death

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.469 
it was a couple of shots away from death
and<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.759> Marauders<00:01:21.090> actually<00:01:21.360> could<00:01:21.450> have

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
and the Marauders actually could have

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.090 
and the Marauders actually could have
killed<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:21.869> there<00:01:22.020> but<00:01:22.170> they<00:01:22.290> got<00:01:22.320> stuck<00:01:22.770> up<00:01:22.950> on

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
killed it there but they got stuck up on

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.260 
killed it there but they got stuck up on
those<00:01:23.250> servings<00:01:23.759> apparently<00:01:24.060> they<00:01:24.119> were<00:01:24.180> just

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
those servings apparently they were just

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.450 
those servings apparently they were just
kind<00:01:24.479> of<00:01:24.600> not<00:01:25.110> deciding<00:01:25.500> not<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.650> attack<00:01:25.979> so

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
kind of not deciding not to attack so

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.740 
kind of not deciding not to attack so
he's<00:01:26.610> tried<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:26.850> do<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:26.970> queen<00:01:27.270> snipe<00:01:27.570> there

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
he's tried to do a queen snipe there

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.330 
he's tried to do a queen snipe there
obviously<00:01:27.960> that<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:28.439> didn't<00:01:28.890> end<00:01:28.979> up<00:01:29.159> working

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
obviously that it didn't end up working

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.859 
obviously that it didn't end up working
out<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:29.610> mean<00:01:29.790> he<00:01:29.880> basically<00:01:30.030> just<00:01:30.329> gave<00:01:30.600> for

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
out I mean he basically just gave for

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.810 
out I mean he basically just gave for
Marauders<00:01:31.020> trying<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.650> kill<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:31.829> queen<00:01:32.130> not

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
Marauders trying to kill a queen not

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.969 
Marauders trying to kill a queen not
really<00:01:33.150> worth<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.570> but<00:01:33.840> again<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.590> muta<00:01:34.740> lists

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
really worth it but again the muta lists

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.469 
really worth it but again the muta lists
not<00:01:35.100> that<00:01:35.310> good<00:01:35.520> against<00:01:35.820> this<00:01:35.880> army<00:01:36.270> so<00:01:36.450> I

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
not that good against this army so I

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.120 
not that good against this army so I
still<00:01:36.750> think<00:01:36.960> they're<00:01:37.110> in<00:01:37.229> pretty<00:01:37.590> okay<00:01:37.890> shape

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
still think they're in pretty okay shape

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.880 
still think they're in pretty okay shape
yeah<00:01:38.939> the<00:01:39.090> medalist<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.659> zergling<00:01:40.290> baneling

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
yeah the medalist and zergling baneling

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.100 
yeah the medalist and zergling baneling
build<00:01:41.070> from<00:01:41.310> artosis<00:01:41.670> i<00:01:42.030> just<00:01:42.390> can't<00:01:42.750> quite

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
build from artosis i just can't quite

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.139 
build from artosis i just can't quite
agree<00:01:43.530> with<00:01:43.710> this<00:01:43.860> I<00:01:44.070> really<00:01:44.640> think<00:01:44.759> artosis

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
agree with this I really think artosis

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.060 
agree with this I really think artosis
needs<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.780> tack<00:01:46.020> up<00:01:46.049> he<00:01:46.530> needs<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.860> get<00:01:47.040> some

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
needs to tack up he needs to get some

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.310 
needs to tack up he needs to get some
investors<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.060> possibly<00:01:48.540> some<00:01:48.750> brood<00:01:49.049> lords

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
investors and possibly some brood lords

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.139 
investors and possibly some brood lords
I<00:01:49.380> think<00:01:49.560> brood<00:01:49.799> lords<00:01:50.100> would<00:01:50.520> be<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.700> huge

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
I think brood lords would be a huge

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.480 
I think brood lords would be a huge
benefit<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.380> Zurich<00:01:52.649> army<00:01:52.979> especially

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
benefit to the Zurich army especially

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.249 
benefit to the Zurich army especially
considering<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.060> Protoss<00:01:54.479> composition<00:01:55.140> of

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
considering the Protoss composition of

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.020 
considering the Protoss composition of
all<00:01:55.500> of<00:01:55.619> these<00:01:55.740> ground<00:01:56.189> army<00:01:56.490> units<00:01:56.759> right<00:01:56.909> now

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
all of these ground army units right now

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.760 
all of these ground army units right now
and<00:01:57.210> look<00:01:57.630> at<00:01:57.780> this<00:01:57.930> we<00:01:58.140> have<00:01:58.290> some<00:01:58.500> three

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
and look at this we have some three

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.530 
and look at this we have some three
Ravens<00:01:59.250> from<00:01:59.460> general<00:01:59.909> moving<00:02:00.210> in<00:02:00.299> from<00:02:00.479> the

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
Ravens from general moving in from the

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.420 
Ravens from general moving in from the
north<00:02:00.659> I<00:02:01.140> don't<00:02:01.680> know<00:02:01.799> how<00:02:01.920> much<00:02:02.070> damage<00:02:02.250> this

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
north I don't know how much damage this

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.530 
north I don't know how much damage this
is<00:02:02.549> going<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.729> be<00:02:02.790> able<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:02.969> do<00:02:03.090> but<00:02:03.240> they<00:02:03.360> are

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
is going to be able to do but they are

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.359 
is going to be able to do but they are
going<00:02:03.719> to<00:02:03.810> unload<00:02:04.170> some<00:02:04.439> auto<00:02:04.740> turrets<00:02:05.189> on

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
going to unload some auto turrets on

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.639 
going to unload some auto turrets on
these<00:02:05.610> probes<00:02:06.000> now<00:02:06.990> this<00:02:07.140> is<00:02:07.200> actually<00:02:07.619> a

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
these probes now this is actually a

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:08.820 
these probes now this is actually a
pretty<00:02:07.860> good<00:02:07.950> strategy

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
pretty good strategy

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.350 
pretty good strategy
do<00:02:08.979> if<00:02:09.160> you<00:02:09.310> are<00:02:09.460> someone<00:02:09.729> who<00:02:09.790> likes<00:02:10.090> to<00:02:10.240> use

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
do if you are someone who likes to use

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.610 
do if you are someone who likes to use
Ravens<00:02:10.570> they<00:02:10.810> look<00:02:10.930> carefully<00:02:11.200> I<00:02:11.320> don't<00:02:11.500> want

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
Ravens they look carefully I don't want

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.110 
Ravens they look carefully I don't want
the<00:02:11.680> Ravens<00:02:11.950> to<00:02:12.010> get<00:02:12.100> shot<00:02:12.310> down<00:02:12.340> by<00:02:12.850> the

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
the Ravens to get shot down by the

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.030 
the Ravens to get shot down by the
stalkers<00:02:13.780> now<00:02:14.110> the<00:02:14.170> problem<00:02:14.410> with<00:02:14.620> doing<00:02:14.830> it

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
stalkers now the problem with doing it

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.620 
stalkers now the problem with doing it
right<00:02:15.190> now<00:02:15.340> is<00:02:15.370> that<00:02:15.640> qxe<00:02:16.090> has<00:02:16.300> a<00:02:16.330> bunch<00:02:16.570> of

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
right now is that qxe has a bunch of

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.960 
right now is that qxe has a bunch of
stalkers<00:02:17.080> with<00:02:17.320> link<00:02:17.680> and<00:02:17.920> so<00:02:18.430> these<00:02:18.640> these

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
stalkers with link and so these these

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.640 
stalkers with link and so these these
auto<00:02:19.240> turrets<00:02:19.630> aren't<00:02:19.870> actually<00:02:20.140> doing<00:02:20.470> that

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
auto turrets aren't actually doing that

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.800 
auto turrets aren't actually doing that
much<00:02:20.860> damage<00:02:21.070> usually<00:02:21.850> this<00:02:21.970> does<00:02:22.210> work<00:02:22.240> but

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
much damage usually this does work but

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:24.600 
much damage usually this does work but
good<00:02:23.080> control<00:02:23.440> here<00:02:23.560> from<00:02:23.680> qxe<00:02:24.070> able<00:02:24.370> to<00:02:24.430> push

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
good control here from qxe able to push

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.520 
good control here from qxe able to push
that<00:02:24.760> out<00:02:24.820> and<00:02:25.120> the<00:02:25.600> middle<00:02:25.930> is<00:02:26.020> from<00:02:26.230> artosis

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
that out and the middle is from artosis

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.620 
that out and the middle is from artosis
coming<00:02:27.010> in<00:02:27.070> here<00:02:27.220> to<00:02:27.340> clean<00:02:27.580> up<00:02:27.850> those<00:02:28.030> very

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
coming in here to clean up those very

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.300 
coming in here to clean up those very
expensive<00:02:29.290> ravens<00:02:29.650> that<00:02:29.830> was<00:02:29.920> actually<00:02:30.100> a

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
expensive ravens that was actually a

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.940 
expensive ravens that was actually a
very<00:02:30.640> huge<00:02:31.060> hit<00:02:31.330> I<00:02:31.540> can't<00:02:32.170> quite<00:02:32.320> agree<00:02:32.770> with

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
very huge hit I can't quite agree with

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.070 
very huge hit I can't quite agree with
general<00:02:33.370> moving<00:02:33.760> out<00:02:33.910> three<00:02:34.390> extremely

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
general moving out three extremely

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.040 
general moving out three extremely
expensive<00:02:35.620> high-tech<00:02:36.310> Ravens<00:02:37.240> all<00:02:37.660> the<00:02:37.990> way

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
expensive high-tech Ravens all the way

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.600 
expensive high-tech Ravens all the way
out<00:02:38.080> by<00:02:38.350> themselves<00:02:38.500> without<00:02:38.830> any<00:02:39.190> defense

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
out by themselves without any defense

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.460 
out by themselves without any defense
and<00:02:39.880> then<00:02:39.970> basically<00:02:40.210> just<00:02:40.660> losing<00:02:41.080> them<00:02:41.200> for

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
and then basically just losing them for

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.760 
and then basically just losing them for
no<00:02:41.710> economic<00:02:41.980> gain<00:02:42.550> or<00:02:42.790> damage<00:02:43.780> whatsoever<00:02:44.050> so

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
no economic gain or damage whatsoever so

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.440 
no economic gain or damage whatsoever so
general<00:02:45.430> they're<00:02:45.550> kind<00:02:45.820> of<00:02:45.850> tossing<00:02:46.300> away<00:02:46.390> a

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
general they're kind of tossing away a

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.420 
general they're kind of tossing away a
couple<00:02:46.630> of<00:02:46.840> those<00:02:46.959> valuable<00:02:47.230> Ravens<00:02:47.950> that

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
couple of those valuable Ravens that

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:49.770 
couple of those valuable Ravens that
really<00:02:48.760> could<00:02:48.910> have<00:02:49.030> come<00:02:49.150> into<00:02:49.360> play<00:02:49.570> later

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
really could have come into play later

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.930 
really could have come into play later
on<00:02:50.080> meanwhile<00:02:50.830> some<00:02:51.100> mutilates<00:02:51.520> moving<00:02:51.820> out

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
on the other side of the map gonna try

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.070 
on the other side of the map gonna try
to<00:02:53.830> poke<00:02:54.100> in<00:02:54.310> and<00:02:54.490> do<00:02:54.580> some<00:02:54.790> damage<00:02:55.090> gonna<00:02:55.870> kill

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
to poke in and do some damage gonna kill

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.990 
to poke in and do some damage gonna kill
off<00:02:56.200> this<00:02:56.320> Marauder<00:02:56.709> actually<00:02:57.190> as<00:02:57.340> the<00:02:57.820> to

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
off this Marauder actually as the to

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.850 
off this Marauder actually as the to
terrence<00:02:58.390> looking<00:02:58.720> to<00:02:58.810> claim<00:02:59.350> that<00:02:59.620> gold

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
terrence looking to claim that gold

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.520 
terrence looking to claim that gold
expansion<00:03:00.370> yeah<00:03:01.300> now<00:03:01.540> they're<00:03:01.720> moving<00:03:02.050> out<00:03:02.290> to

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
expansion yeah now they're moving out to

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.560 
expansion yeah now they're moving out to
that<00:03:02.709> gold<00:03:02.890> expansion<00:03:03.430> and<00:03:03.700> those<00:03:03.940> ravens<00:03:04.390> i

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
that gold expansion and those ravens i

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.230 
that gold expansion and those ravens i
was<00:03:04.660> about<00:03:04.780> 600<00:03:05.470> 600<00:03:05.890> gasps<00:03:06.280> worth<00:03:06.610> of<00:03:06.820> raven

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.240 
was about 600 600 gasps worth of raven

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:08.730 
was about 600 600 gasps worth of raven
so<00:03:07.720> they're<00:03:07.870> really<00:03:08.170> gonna<00:03:08.290> have<00:03:08.410> to<00:03:08.470> move<00:03:08.620> out

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
so they're really gonna have to move out

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.410 
so they're really gonna have to move out
the<00:03:08.890> shrine<00:03:09.160> recoup<00:03:09.550> for<00:03:09.760> their<00:03:09.880> losses<00:03:10.090> in

the shrine recoup for their losses in

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.330 
the shrine recoup for their losses in
that<00:03:10.630> regard<00:03:10.959> now<00:03:11.350> general<00:03:11.890> I<00:03:11.950> think<00:03:11.980> should

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
that regard now general I think should

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.949 
that regard now general I think should
continue<00:03:12.850> to<00:03:12.940> produce<00:03:13.090> Ravens<00:03:13.570> I<00:03:13.660> think<00:03:13.870> those

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
continue to produce Ravens I think those

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.080 
continue to produce Ravens I think those
hunter<00:03:14.260> seeker<00:03:14.560> missiles<00:03:14.920> can<00:03:15.100> be<00:03:15.220> so<00:03:15.610> strong

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
hunter seeker missiles can be so strong

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.240 
hunter seeker missiles can be so strong
in<00:03:16.330> to<00:03:16.540> be<00:03:16.660> too<00:03:16.870> and<00:03:17.140> I<00:03:17.500> do<00:03:17.560> like<00:03:17.860> the<00:03:17.980> fact<00:03:18.010> that

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
in to be too and I do like the fact that

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.949 
in to be too and I do like the fact that
they<00:03:18.400> have<00:03:18.700> a<00:03:18.730> bunch<00:03:19.150> of<00:03:19.239> Tours<00:03:19.510> out<00:03:19.720> on<00:03:19.870> the

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
they have a bunch of Tours out on the

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:21.150 
they have a bunch of Tours out on the
field<00:03:20.110> the<00:03:20.290> doors<00:03:20.500> are<00:03:20.650> basically<00:03:20.980> good

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
field the doors are basically good

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.310 
field the doors are basically good
against<00:03:21.459> everything<00:03:21.880> when<00:03:22.600> you<00:03:22.720> have<00:03:22.930> a<00:03:22.959> big

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
against everything when you have a big

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.380 
against everything when you have a big
ball<00:03:23.590> like<00:03:23.769> this<00:03:23.950> so<00:03:24.190> the<00:03:24.610> map<00:03:24.820> is<00:03:25.000> about<00:03:25.209> to<00:03:25.300> be

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
ball like this so the map is about to be

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:26.940 
ball like this so the map is about to be
cut<00:03:25.630> in<00:03:25.750> half<00:03:25.780> here<00:03:26.170> as<00:03:26.320> there's<00:03:26.560> a<00:03:26.620> drink

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
cut in half here as there's a drink

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.490 
cut in half here as there's a drink
that's<00:03:27.070> high<00:03:27.430> you<00:03:27.720> jinro<00:03:28.720> actually<00:03:29.170> has<00:03:29.320> some

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
that's high you jinro actually has some

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:30.900 
that's high you jinro actually has some

corner our ptosis head is mutis out he

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.220 
corner our ptosis head is mutis out he
actually<00:04:06.330> misclicked<00:04:07.330> them<00:04:07.570> a<00:04:07.600> little<00:04:07.840> bit<00:04:08.080> he

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
actually misclicked them a little bit he

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:09.180 
actually misclicked them a little bit he
had<00:04:08.320> them<00:04:08.440> out<00:04:08.560> in<00:04:08.620> the<00:04:08.680> center<00:04:08.920> of<00:04:08.950> the<00:04:09.010> field

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
had them out in the center of the field

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:10.949 
had them out in the center of the field
and<00:04:09.430> actually<00:04:09.549> lost<00:04:09.940> all<00:04:10.239> of<00:04:10.269> his<00:04:10.420> mute<00:04:10.660> lists

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
and actually lost all of his mute lists

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.140 
and actually lost all of his mute lists
so<00:04:11.170> his<00:04:11.590> army<00:04:11.980> size<00:04:12.160> definitely<00:04:12.489> not<00:04:12.850> looking

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
so his army size definitely not looking

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.789 
so his army size definitely not looking
very<00:04:13.180> good<00:04:13.390> here<00:04:13.630> because<00:04:14.470> like<00:04:14.620> you're

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
very good here because like you're

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:16.830 
very good here because like you're

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
saying the the mute lists just aren't

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.599 
saying the the mute lists just aren't

that good against those you know Thor's

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:20.099 
that good against those you know Thor's
and<00:04:18.880> Marines<00:04:19.120> they<00:04:19.330> just<00:04:19.510> melt<00:04:19.660> away<00:04:19.810> and

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
and Marines they just melt away and

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:21.660 
and Marines they just melt away and
we've<00:04:20.530> been<00:04:20.650> mentioning<00:04:21.010> the<00:04:21.130> siege<00:04:21.400> tank

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:05.250 
Templars actually getting taken out but
that's<00:06:02.800> okay<00:06:03.190> because<00:06:03.220> they<00:06:03.670> did<00:06:03.850> so<00:06:04.390> much<00:06:04.630> so

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:05.260 
that's okay because they did so much so

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.710 
that's okay because they did so much so

are doing pretty well but I'm not quite

to tell him all he needs to know that

to tell him all he needs to know that
there's<00:06:24.100> going<00:06:24.250> to<00:06:24.340> be<00:06:24.370> a<00:06:24.430> dupe<00:06:24.699> drop<00:06:24.970> on<00:06:25.180> the

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360 
there's going to be a dupe drop on the

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.150 
there's going to be a dupe drop on the
way<00:06:25.510> and<00:06:25.780> these<00:06:26.350> overlords<00:06:26.770> are<00:06:26.860> though<00:06:27.010> are

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:27.160 
way and these overlords are though are

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.740 
way and these overlords are though are
just<00:06:27.460> filled<00:06:27.729> with<00:06:27.850> certain<00:06:28.330> Ling's<00:06:28.479> and

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:28.750 
just filled with certain Ling's and

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:30.480 
just filled with certain Ling's and
banelings<00:06:29.290> so<00:06:29.410> even<00:06:29.650> if<00:06:29.740> he<00:06:29.800> gets<00:06:29.979> inside<00:06:30.130> the

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:30.490 
banelings so even if he gets inside the

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:31.620 
banelings so even if he gets inside the
base<00:06:30.669> I<00:06:30.880> don't<00:06:31.060> know<00:06:31.150> if<00:06:31.210> it's<00:06:31.300> going<00:06:31.419> to<00:06:31.510> do

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:31.630 
base I don't know if it's going to do

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:33.210 
base I don't know if it's going to do
the<00:06:31.720> amount<00:06:31.930> of<00:06:31.960> damage<00:06:32.290> he<00:06:32.320> needs<00:06:32.710> because

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:33.220 
the amount of damage he needs because

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:35.280 
the amount of damage he needs because
they<00:06:33.639> don't<00:06:33.820> kill<00:06:34.090> buildings<00:06:34.660> nearly<00:06:34.990> as<00:06:35.080> fast

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:35.290 
they don't kill buildings nearly as fast

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:37.110 
they don't kill buildings nearly as fast
they<00:06:35.500> do<00:06:35.680> in<00:06:35.830> starcraft<00:06:36.280> one<00:06:36.550> especially

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.120 
they do in starcraft one especially

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.700 
they do in starcraft one especially
since<00:06:37.449> the<00:06:37.540> buildings<00:06:37.810> can<00:06:37.930> clump<00:06:38.169> up<00:06:38.350> so<00:06:38.530> well

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:38.710 
since the buildings can clump up so well

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:40.320 
since the buildings can clump up so well
down<00:06:38.919> so<00:06:39.340> our<00:06:39.430> ptosis<00:06:39.790> is<00:06:39.910> really<00:06:40.180> going<00:06:40.270> to

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:40.330 
down so our ptosis is really going to

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:41.520 
down so our ptosis is really going to
have<00:06:40.449> to<00:06:40.540> get<00:06:40.600> them<00:06:40.750> out<00:06:40.900> of<00:06:40.930> position<00:06:41.080> to<00:06:41.410> make

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:41.530 
have to get them out of position to make

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:43.140 
have to get them out of position to make
a<00:06:41.560> drop<00:06:41.800> like<00:06:42.010> this<00:06:42.160> work<00:06:42.400> and<00:06:42.669> also<00:06:42.850> there's<00:06:43.090> a

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:43.150 
a drop like this work and also there's a

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:44.700 
a drop like this work and also there's a
drop<00:06:43.330> in<00:06:43.479> the<00:06:43.570> main<00:06:43.750> of<00:06:43.990> artosis<00:06:44.290> right<00:06:44.590> now

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:44.710 
drop in the main of artosis right now

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:47.430 
drop in the main of artosis right now
yeah<00:06:45.460> Jenna<00:06:46.120> artosis<00:06:46.600> actually<00:06:47.050> pulled<00:06:47.260> back

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:47.440 
yeah Jenna artosis actually pulled back

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.260 
yeah Jenna artosis actually pulled back
to<00:06:47.620> deal<00:06:47.800> with<00:06:47.949> that<00:06:48.039> inch<00:06:48.250> and<00:06:48.490> liquid<00:06:48.880> jinro

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:49.270 
to deal with that inch and liquid jinro

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:51.090 
to deal with that inch and liquid jinro
pull<00:06:49.840> it<00:06:49.930> out<00:06:50.020> of<00:06:50.139> there<00:06:50.229> pretty<00:06:50.500> convincingly

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:51.100 
pull it out of there pretty convincingly

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:52.980 
pull it out of there pretty convincingly
didn't<00:06:51.430> lose<00:06:51.580> any<00:06:51.789> of<00:06:51.850> his<00:06:52.000> forces<00:06:52.419> but<00:06:52.870> the

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:52.990 
didn't lose any of his forces but the

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:54.810 
didn't lose any of his forces but the
thing<00:06:53.020> is<00:06:53.229> our<00:06:53.500> ptosis<00:06:53.889> I'm<00:06:54.039> not<00:06:54.220> sure<00:06:54.580> if<00:06:54.760> he's

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:54.820 
thing is our ptosis I'm not sure if he's

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:56.279 
thing is our ptosis I'm not sure if he's
going<00:06:55.030> to<00:06:55.120> be<00:06:55.240> able<00:06:55.360> to<00:06:55.539> drop<00:06:55.780> look<00:06:56.080> at<00:06:56.169> that

00:06:56.279 --> 00:06:56.289 
going to be able to drop look at that

00:06:56.289 --> 00:06:58.110 
going to be able to drop look at that
he's<00:06:56.470> actually<00:06:56.620> unloading<00:06:57.460> his<00:06:57.580> units

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:58.120 
he's actually unloading his units

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.629 
he's actually unloading his units
because<00:06:58.870> he<00:06:59.050> revealed<00:06:59.500> his<00:06:59.740> drop<00:07:00.039> technology

00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:00.639 
because he revealed his drop technology

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:02.460 
because he revealed his drop technology
to<00:07:01.090> his<00:07:01.210> opponent<00:07:01.600> so<00:07:01.720> he's<00:07:01.840> not<00:07:02.050> gonna<00:07:02.199> do

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:02.470 
to his opponent so he's not gonna do

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:04.140 
to his opponent so he's not gonna do
that<00:07:02.500> right<00:07:02.770> now<00:07:02.830> he's<00:07:03.100> gonna<00:07:03.220> unload<00:07:03.610> all<00:07:03.910> the

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:04.150 
that right now he's gonna unload all the

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:06.390 
that right now he's gonna unload all the
zerglings<00:07:04.449> and<00:07:04.810> banelings<00:07:05.229> and<00:07:05.410> one<00:07:06.010> thing<00:07:06.250> I

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:06.400 
zerglings and banelings and one thing I

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.550 
zerglings and banelings and one thing I
just<00:07:06.699> can't<00:07:07.030> agree<00:07:07.360> with<00:07:07.510> our<00:07:07.539> ptosis<00:07:08.050> is<00:07:08.169> I

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:08.560 
just can't agree with our ptosis is I

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.710 
just can't agree with our ptosis is I
really<00:07:09.010> think<00:07:09.370> he<00:07:09.910> should<00:07:10.120> be<00:07:10.240> getting<00:07:10.419> Roach

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:10.720 
really think he should be getting Roach

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.750 
really think he should be getting Roach
hydra<00:07:11.169> right<00:07:11.320> now<00:07:11.440> or<00:07:11.590> something<00:07:11.860> stronger

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:12.760 
hydra right now or something stronger

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.460 
hydra right now or something stronger
than<00:07:12.789> zergling<00:07:13.270> baneling<00:07:13.690> because<00:07:14.289> these

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:14.470 
than zergling baneling because these

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:16.409 
than zergling baneling because these
banelings<00:07:15.130> and<00:07:15.370> zerglings<00:07:15.820> are<00:07:15.970> just<00:07:16.240> going

00:07:16.409 --> 00:07:16.419 
banelings and zerglings are just going

00:07:16.419 --> 00:07:18.450 
banelings and zerglings are just going
to<00:07:16.449> get<00:07:16.570> evaporated<00:07:17.110> by<00:07:17.710> the<00:07:17.770> siege<00:07:18.070> tanks

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:18.460 
to get evaporated by the siege tanks

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:20.129 
to get evaporated by the siege tanks
currently<00:07:18.910> holding<00:07:19.210> the<00:07:19.419> center<00:07:19.780> of<00:07:19.810> the<00:07:19.960> map

00:07:20.129 --> 00:07:20.139 
currently holding the center of the map

00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:23.279 
currently holding the center of the map
I<00:07:20.700> think<00:07:21.700> it<00:07:21.970> if<00:07:22.479> I<00:07:22.599> was<00:07:22.720> a<00:07:22.750> zerg<00:07:22.960> player<00:07:22.990> right

00:07:23.279 --> 00:07:23.289 
I think it if I was a zerg player right

00:07:23.289 --> 00:07:24.629 
I think it if I was a zerg player right
now<00:07:23.410> I'd<00:07:23.560> be<00:07:23.680> pretty<00:07:23.830> sad<00:07:24.099> going<00:07:24.340> against

00:07:24.629 --> 00:07:24.639 
now I'd be pretty sad going against

00:07:24.639 --> 00:07:25.920 
now I'd be pretty sad going against
double<00:07:24.940> Terran<00:07:25.180> because<00:07:25.389> if<00:07:25.510> you<00:07:25.599> go<00:07:25.750> the

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:25.930 
double Terran because if you go the

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:27.270 
double Terran because if you go the
roach<00:07:26.080> hydra<00:07:26.560> they're<00:07:26.800> going<00:07:26.950> to<00:07:27.010> get<00:07:27.070> owned

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:27.280 
roach hydra they're going to get owned

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:29.190 
roach hydra they're going to get owned
by<00:07:27.460> siege<00:07:27.700> tanks<00:07:28.000> and<00:07:28.120> Thor's<00:07:28.330> if<00:07:28.510> you<00:07:28.870> go<00:07:29.020> the

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:29.200 
by siege tanks and Thor's if you go the

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.510 
by siege tanks and Thor's if you go the
master<00:07:29.530> things<00:07:29.800> are<00:07:29.889> going<00:07:30.010> to<00:07:30.070> get<00:07:30.160> owned<00:07:30.340> by

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:30.520 
master things are going to get owned by

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.040 
master things are going to get owned by
the<00:07:30.580> Hellions<00:07:31.030> and<00:07:31.240> siege<00:07:31.389> tanks<00:07:31.750> and<00:07:31.900> just

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:32.050 
the Hellions and siege tanks and just

00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:34.290 
the Hellions and siege tanks and just
about<00:07:32.200> everything<00:07:32.530> and<00:07:32.860> so<00:07:33.310> I<00:07:33.370> think<00:07:33.669> his<00:07:33.880> only

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:34.300 
about everything and so I think his only

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.060 
about everything and so I think his only
viable<00:07:34.570> option<00:07:34.780> right<00:07:35.229> now<00:07:35.289> is<00:07:35.620> to<00:07:35.650> get<00:07:35.889> that

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:36.070 
viable option right now is to get that

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:37.710 
viable option right now is to get that
greater<00:07:36.340> Spyre<00:07:36.669> which<00:07:36.940> is<00:07:37.090> what<00:07:37.270> he's<00:07:37.389> doing

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:37.720 
greater Spyre which is what he's doing

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.540 
greater Spyre which is what he's doing
to<00:07:38.080> try<00:07:38.349> and<00:07:38.680> get<00:07:38.800> the<00:07:38.919> brood<00:07:39.130> lords<00:07:39.370> out

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:39.550 
to try and get the brood lords out

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:40.890 
to try and get the brood lords out
because<00:07:39.970> then<00:07:40.180> you<00:07:40.240> can<00:07:40.389> use<00:07:40.510> the<00:07:40.660> splash

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:40.900 
because then you can use the splash

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.169 
because then you can use the splash
damage
