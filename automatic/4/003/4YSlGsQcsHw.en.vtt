 the world must know the old 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.840
 for every second sun break through the base that was a bit of a 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:50.989
 competition situation 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:54.300

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.590
 and the SGP so can drag in now there must be considering the Spaniard 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.330

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.530
 just passing by the old church is in front of me 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.090
 coene 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.670
 reliable left hand side to be trusted, wait a moment 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.049
 are now running therefore his work is all that young 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:20.180
 the draw still an ennemi next to us the job to drive for this purpose 

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:22.929
 I do not like that at all and I can also not say that they are all killer goodies 

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:23.630
 learned again 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.190
 I sat at the old age that and is tasty that you know why try 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:30.800
 with 50 0 to win than with all villages boys core gamer in the chains 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.840
 and considering the market but sitting where her husband tried to share with as many as 50 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.190
 mille the sweat sko so valuable market because i had stop and all people 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.960
 up the smoke 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.630
 all but just I look it is a nice even for 8 11 5 0 accord 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.490
 sent 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.400
 nice then there is option again 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.180
 with his vision are left on 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.830
 hopefully we can 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.450
 that hard point to reach a six-second alert natural awareness point 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.700
 6 scan the Slovakian 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.280
 all there at the tank this is a window is actually want that in that 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.729
 city 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.310
 she who knows pussy thank you 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.290
 could have been blocking point to dragging in yes 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.909
 all new singer the roof so the damage is not so bad guys 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:08.359
 we were still there that way 

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:11.489
 then you will try to drag in children of course if the region makes it too 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.419
 look a little together so that will not work out who will see it 

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:15.990
 state and is about thirty 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.290
 I am coming to broadcast suggested its now leading the rider and being 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.369
 the same ones who help are part of his helpers and share are open again 

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:24.609
 they counted on stronger help 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:26.969
 if you are on it i'm also in Brugge 

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:30.349
 I still sit on both of them there are still very beautiful so you can 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:34.379
 but they were dragged in points that red hoolies jet luckily won't 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:37.019
 will of course not be able to reach prosperous countries, but how 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.590
 will be a nickname by a revolver of sweat scored that leader 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.879
 After all, has a clear day that runs well due to one 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:47.549
 radio poland poland who came here this way then it remains on boys it appears 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:50.669
 seems to go on well so we go back to order 

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:54.169
 they also know that I am going to try the tram 5 0 valÃ¨re I try reasonably 

00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:56.899
 often to do but still really hard to pick up you just have to 

00:02:56.899 --> 00:03:00.479
 every chord you have to drag in all ps3 can drag in you just have to 

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:02.179
 everything drags in and misses 

00:03:02.179 --> 00:03:05.719
 just four pacers so you still regret you will not be able to make it 

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:09.469
 so they also have to stay a billion pounds, they just have to keep walking around for one 

00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:12.469
 in the hope that they will not die in the hope that Iraq can make points 

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:13.340
 keep on keeping 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.870
 and what we are doing now with the three other sizes 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.720
 we are just training the carport so the and is not around 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.090
 can agree 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.769
 of course axes and is not close to agree they can also 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:24.139
 that desperately needed 

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:27.129
 trying to grab that is of course not nothing either she dragged in 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:30.469
 a very nice tactic to use if you go for about 250 wants 

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:30.969
 boys 

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:33.889
 extraordinary meijer and it remains home and is surrounded by killian 

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:36.659
 look this to be who do agree with full stuff we are going to succeed 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:37.260
 what I can 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.700
 in advance the throat is a nice one 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.359
 tactics that you just have to stay 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:44.449
 perseverance and they are now on a full battery is just as bad we still have on the 

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:48.209
 old dirty hands of the checkout boy therefore the lines must go through quickly 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.909
 the and again the next thing we should of course just be in your area 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:51.699
 stay 

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:55.069
 it always keeps a hell storm its all do 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:57.400
 wild woman building is there in the middle 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.810
 if that through building 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.470
 I have the feeling that they are unjustly strained from going, but came over 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.610
 Heracles are still depositing behind these packages and it still says just that 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:07.770
 fat hard for them can now go here so what we want of course also one 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.820
 bit and that is porto but I am standing here this comet around this country 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:14.660
 I mean that he is the new top I am going to co-run the runners if we are already up 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.120
 states should be able to make no difference if I have a team full of other people 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.290
 they all just about right on states, the roles are nicely divided 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.810
 Pascal Minne but then Shiites I have to join now 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.590
 from the lost all come more naturally it must be safety seconds 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:27.990
 be able to watch full evenings 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.430
 seven seconds 17 seconds commission from now on the thirteen seconds 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.900
 in terms of format package I am dead to death but just back from the estate 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.069
 ceded 

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:37.229
 goes well 6 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:40.229
 five does not accrue and inspires 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.890
 j as a youth coach head coach ever if you like it if you make it a super super cup too 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:48.060
 nice for hours than these these pace playbacken boys 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.160
 because of the much easier and therefore they all go there to appeal 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:51.650
 to sit 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.570
 we can make man almost eleven in this market for the warm climate of today 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.070
 we can leg it ourselves to ommense comma zero comma zero comma we 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:59.779
 continue the story 

00:04:59.779 --> 00:05:03.279
 point points points.the stories to go out afterwards a bottle was lost 

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:04.800
 but it seems every bottle is 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.990
 if names can do most, then you are further down the line among investors 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.280
 we speak the fight of throwing though I thought when people buy 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.670
 swan all here so or after the trusses my function doesn't matter if you are there 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:18.100
 affects a child is always welcome twice that you are even better than welcome 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.550

 still on booths come on people outside of the on Brennan Petrels 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:30.630
 voltage is then in our hands 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.830
 if you are there there were some but this code must go away and if grabbed 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:35.620
 psv inside 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.659
