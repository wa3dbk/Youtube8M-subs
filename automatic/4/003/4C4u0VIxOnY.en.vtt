00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.290

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.760

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:32.640
 the helmet on the nose next 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.960

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.229

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.229
 boss 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:02:04.689
 if I ask is not valid with na 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:08.410

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:17.290
 We have been asking to go home 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:18.640

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.200

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.950

 I'm fine, there's got to be before 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.680

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.680

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.660

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.130
 absolutely none 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.260

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.209
 The fight did not turn out to be silly 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.530
 as fought today and tomorrow 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.489
