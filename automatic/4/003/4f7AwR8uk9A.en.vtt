00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.070 
then lost them for whoever length of

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.310 
then lost them for whoever length of
time<00:03:46.220> would<00:03:46.489> be<00:03:46.690> shown<00:03:47.690> even<00:03:47.840> make<00:03:48.050> a<00:03:48.080> big

Monday<00:05:53.159> we<00:05:53.400> just<00:05:54.120> felt<00:05:54.330> you<00:05:54.569> know<00:05:54.659> 23<00:05:55.289> it<00:05:55.409> was

00:05:55.519 --> 00:05:55.529 
Monday we just felt you know 23 it was

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:57.619 
Monday we just felt you know 23 it was
time<00:05:55.770> from<00:05:55.979> he<00:05:56.639> probably<00:05:57.000> would<00:05:57.270> get<00:05:57.389> as<00:05:57.539> much

00:05:57.619 --> 00:05:57.629 
time from he probably would get as much

00:05:57.629 --> 00:06:00.019 
time from he probably would get as much
game<00:05:57.900> time<00:05:57.930> here<00:05:58.889> that<00:05:59.189> he<00:05:59.250> would<00:05:59.400> deals<00:05:59.729> were

00:06:00.019 --> 00:06:00.029 
game time here that he would deals were

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:03.019 
game time here that he would deals were
so<00:06:00.229> it's<00:06:01.229> best<00:06:01.529> fuel<00:06:01.860> to<00:06:02.069> go<00:06:02.699> get<00:06:02.879> some

00:06:03.019 --> 00:06:03.029 
so it's best fuel to go get some

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:05.480 
so it's best fuel to go get some
experience<00:06:03.300> elsewhere<00:06:03.689> okay<00:06:04.680> and<00:06:04.919> you
