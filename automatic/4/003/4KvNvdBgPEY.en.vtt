you ask me if it's my money what am i

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.199 
you ask me if it's my money what am i
buying<00:02:27.469> the<00:02:28.370> answer<00:02:28.579> is<00:02:28.670> that<00:02:28.790> this<00:02:28.909> car<00:02:29.120> was

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
buying the answer is that this car was

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:30.670 
buying the answer is that this car was
certainly<00:02:29.480> making<00:02:29.659> it<00:02:29.810> to<00:02:29.900> my<00:02:30.019> top<00:02:30.260> three<00:02:30.530> or

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
certainly making it to my top three or

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.099 
certainly making it to my top three or
top<00:02:30.890> four<00:02:31.280> but<00:02:31.939> it<00:02:32.030> probably<00:02:32.389> won't<00:02:32.659> be<00:02:32.900> at<00:02:33.019> the

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:33.109 
top four but it probably won't be at the

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:34.899 
top four but it probably won't be at the
top<00:02:33.349> the<00:02:33.530> list<00:02:33.709> and<00:02:33.950> i'll<00:02:34.040> tell<00:02:34.459> you<00:02:34.489> why<00:02:34.639> i

00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:34.909 
top the list and i'll tell you why i

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:36.970 
top the list and i'll tell you why i
think<00:02:35.150> the<00:02:35.959> styling<00:02:36.379> is<00:02:36.409> a<00:02:36.500> little<00:02:36.680> bit<00:02:36.769> dated

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
think the styling is a little bit dated

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.379 
think the styling is a little bit dated
it's<00:02:37.340> been<00:02:37.489> out<00:02:37.639> now<00:02:37.819> since<00:02:38.090> about<00:02:38.239> two

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:38.389 
it's been out now since about two

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:42.490 
it's been out now since about two
thousand<00:02:38.810> seven<00:02:38.989> a<00:02:39.920> very<00:02:40.730> little<00:02:41.439> room<00:02:42.439> for

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
thousand seven a very little room for

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.709 
thousand seven a very little room for
four<00:02:43.099> cups<00:02:43.519> and<00:02:43.849> keys<00:02:44.090> and<00:02:44.359> things<00:02:44.510> like<00:02:44.659> that

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:44.719 
four cups and keys and things like that

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:47.440 
four cups and keys and things like that
I<00:02:45.469> think<00:02:45.980> confetti<00:02:46.280> needs<00:02:46.519> to<00:02:46.700> improve<00:02:47.180> that

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
I think confetti needs to improve that

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.259 
I think confetti needs to improve that
and<00:02:47.739> overall<00:02:48.739> the<00:02:48.919> drive<00:02:49.129> is<00:02:49.280> nice<00:02:49.519> but<00:02:50.209> I

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
and overall the drive is nice but I

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:53.050 
and overall the drive is nice but I
think<00:02:50.599> with<00:02:50.900> the<00:02:50.989> new<00:02:51.109> BMW<00:02:51.319> out<00:02:51.799> new<00:02:52.609> Mercedes

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
think with the new BMW out new Mercedes

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.759 
think with the new BMW out new Mercedes
out<00:02:53.239> an<00:02:53.419> Audi<00:02:53.629> for<00:02:53.959> example<00:02:54.349> I<00:02:54.470> just<00:02:54.620> don't

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
out an Audi for example I just don't

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:56.679 
out an Audi for example I just don't
think<00:02:54.980> it<00:02:55.069> quite<00:02:55.189> measures<00:02:55.609> up<00:02:55.790> to<00:02:55.819> them<00:02:56.090> but

00:02:56.679 --> 00:02:56.689 
think it quite measures up to them but

00:02:56.689 --> 00:02:59.020 
think it quite measures up to them but
it<00:02:56.930> does<00:02:57.079> offer<00:02:57.230> a<00:02:57.409> nice<00:02:57.650> luxurious<00:02:58.030> riding

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
it does offer a nice luxurious riding

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.179 
it does offer a nice luxurious riding
feel<00:02:59.329> we<00:02:59.900> have<00:03:00.019> to<00:03:00.169> say<00:03:00.349> that<00:03:00.560> infiniti<00:03:01.159> has

00:03:01.179 --> 00:03:01.189 
feel we have to say that infiniti has

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:02.770 
feel we have to say that infiniti has
done<00:03:01.370> a<00:03:01.400> great<00:03:01.579> job<00:03:01.669> of<00:03:01.879> the<00:03:02.090> seats<00:03:02.359> they're

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
done a great job of the seats they're

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.559 
done a great job of the seats they're
firm<00:03:03.530> enough<00:03:03.829> but<00:03:04.219> not<00:03:04.400> now<00:03:04.939> to<00:03:05.000> farmers

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
firm enough but not now to farmers

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.589 
firm enough but not now to farmers
they're<00:03:05.659> going<00:03:05.810> to<00:03:05.870> kind<00:03:06.049> of<00:03:06.219> beat<00:03:07.219> you<00:03:07.250> up<00:03:07.599> the

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:08.599 
they're going to kind of beat you up the

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:10.059 
they're going to kind of beat you up the
steering<00:03:08.930> wheel<00:03:08.959> is<00:03:09.079> nice<00:03:09.409> but<00:03:09.620> overall<00:03:09.950> I

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
steering wheel is nice but overall I

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:12.429 
steering wheel is nice but overall I
think<00:03:10.250> the<00:03:10.819> design<00:03:11.060> is<00:03:11.269> very<00:03:11.540> simple<00:03:12.079> and

00:03:12.429 --> 00:03:12.439 
think the design is very simple and

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:14.890 
think the design is very simple and
that's<00:03:12.919> okay<00:03:13.189> but<00:03:13.419> you<00:03:14.419> look<00:03:14.540> at<00:03:14.629> some<00:03:14.750> of<00:03:14.780> the

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
that's okay but you look at some of the

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.020 
that's okay but you look at some of the
other<00:03:14.930> cars<00:03:15.260> like<00:03:15.469> audi<00:03:15.739> and<00:03:16.189> mercedes<00:03:16.849> a

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
other cars like audi and mercedes a

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
little more sophisticated this is what i

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.770 
little more sophisticated this is what i
was<00:03:19.159> referring<00:03:19.189> to<00:03:19.609> as<00:03:19.699> far<00:03:19.940> as<00:03:20.090> a<00:03:20.120> space

was referring to as far as a space
there's<00:03:21.470> a<00:03:21.709> couple<00:03:22.069> little<00:03:22.280> squares<00:03:22.790> here<00:03:23.060> for

there's a couple little squares here for

there's a couple little squares here for
cup<00:03:23.690> holders<00:03:24.139> and<00:03:24.909> coffee<00:03:25.909> mug<00:03:26.209> or<00:03:26.479> large<00:03:27.169> cup

of<00:03:27.500> coffee<00:03:27.620> is<00:03:27.769> not<00:03:27.859> going<00:03:28.040> to<00:03:28.129> fit<00:03:28.310> in<00:03:28.430> here

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:28.729 
of coffee is not going to fit in here

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:32.439 
of coffee is not going to fit in here
the<00:03:29.709> center<00:03:30.709> console<00:03:31.040> box<00:03:31.220> here<00:03:31.609> you<00:03:32.329> know

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:32.449 
the center console box here you know

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:34.390 
the center console box here you know
under<00:03:32.750> the<00:03:32.780> armrest<00:03:33.169> there's<00:03:33.979> barely<00:03:34.250> enough

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
under the armrest there's barely enough

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.729 
under the armrest there's barely enough
room<00:03:34.639> to<00:03:34.909> put<00:03:34.939> a<00:03:35.120> wallet<00:03:35.870> and<00:03:36.139> a<00:03:36.199> set<00:03:36.409> of<00:03:36.439> keys

room to put a wallet and a set of keys

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:38.500 
room to put a wallet and a set of keys
so<00:03:37.010> really<00:03:37.699> they<00:03:37.849> could<00:03:38.030> have<00:03:38.150> maybe

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
so really they could have maybe

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.479 
so really they could have maybe
maximized<00:03:39.169> some<00:03:39.349> space<00:03:39.620> i<00:03:39.769> know<00:03:39.829> volvo<00:03:40.310> for

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
maximized some space i know volvo for

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.759 
maximized some space i know volvo for
example<00:03:40.909> they<00:03:41.389> use<00:03:41.599> the<00:03:41.780> space<00:03:42.019> behind<00:03:42.229> here

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
example they use the space behind here

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:45.129 
example they use the space behind here
for<00:03:43.129> storage<00:03:43.669> which<00:03:43.970> i<00:03:44.090> think<00:03:44.150> is<00:03:44.479> something

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:45.139 
for storage which i think is something

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:47.589 
for storage which i think is something
that<00:03:45.259> infinity<00:03:45.769> would<00:03:45.919> benefit<00:03:46.280> from<00:03:46.419> so<00:03:47.419> we

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:47.599 
that infinity would benefit from so we

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:48.909 
that infinity would benefit from so we
mentioned<00:03:47.900> that<00:03:48.019> if<00:03:48.169> you<00:03:48.259> want<00:03:48.470> a<00:03:48.530> manual<00:03:48.859> you

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:48.919 
mentioned that if you want a manual you

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:51.249 
mentioned that if you want a manual you
have<00:03:49.009> to<00:03:49.099> go<00:03:49.250> with<00:03:49.489> the<00:03:49.609> sport<00:03:50.079> love<00:03:51.079> the

have to go with the sport love the
six-speed<00:03:51.709> manual<00:03:51.790> if<00:03:52.790> you<00:03:52.970> don't<00:03:53.150> get<00:03:53.269> this

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:53.419 
six-speed manual if you don't get this

00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:54.550 
six-speed manual if you don't get this
car<00:03:53.689> you're<00:03:53.930> going<00:03:54.019> to<00:03:54.109> end<00:03:54.259> up<00:03:54.349> with<00:03:54.530> a

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
car you're going to end up with a

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.039 
car you're going to end up with a
7-speed<00:03:55.159> automatic<00:03:55.189> which<00:03:55.909> is<00:03:56.239> great<00:03:57.019> for

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049 
7-speed automatic which is great for

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:59.439 
7-speed automatic which is great for
fuel<00:03:57.470> economy<00:03:57.979> it's<00:03:58.699> great<00:03:58.879> for<00:03:59.030> overall

00:03:59.439 --> 00:03:59.449 
fuel economy it's great for overall

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:02.170 
fuel economy it's great for overall
performance<00:03:59.930> not<00:04:00.620> great<00:04:00.949> for<00:04:01.129> that<00:04:01.189> 30<00:04:01.549> to<00:04:01.790> 50

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
performance not great for that 30 to 50

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.449 
performance not great for that 30 to 50
or<00:04:02.299> 50<00:04:02.569> to<00:04:02.659> 70<00:04:03.019> acceleration<00:04:03.680> because<00:04:04.009> you

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
or 50 to 70 acceleration because you

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:05.890 
or 50 to 70 acceleration because you
know<00:04:04.549> if<00:04:04.639> you're<00:04:04.759> in<00:04:04.849> like<00:04:05.000> 7th<00:04:05.389> gear<00:04:05.569> or<00:04:05.659> 6th

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
know if you're in like 7th gear or 6th

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.949 
know if you're in like 7th gear or 6th
gear<00:04:06.079> it<00:04:06.500> kind<00:04:06.769> of<00:04:06.799> it<00:04:06.979> has<00:04:07.189> a<00:04:07.220> little<00:04:07.489> delay

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
gear it kind of it has a little delay

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:11.259 
gear it kind of it has a little delay
when<00:04:08.959> you<00:04:09.079> punch<00:04:09.379> it<00:04:09.560> and<00:04:09.739> a<00:04:10.430> lot<00:04:10.879> of<00:04:10.939> the<00:04:11.060> cars

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
when you punch it and a lot of the cars

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:13.509 
when you punch it and a lot of the cars
suffer<00:04:11.750> from<00:04:11.870> it<00:04:12.049> I<00:04:12.139> think<00:04:12.349> infinity<00:04:12.889> suffers

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
suffer from it I think infinity suffers

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:21.099 
suffer from it I think infinity suffers
a<00:04:13.549> little<00:04:13.790> more<00:04:13.939> than<00:04:14.120> the<00:04:14.239> rest

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.779 

oh<00:04:22.479> yeah<00:04:23.479> this<00:04:23.840> is<00:04:23.960> the<00:04:24.050> sport<00:04:24.289> model<00:04:24.789> infinity

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:25.789 
oh yeah this is the sport model infinity

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:27.399 
oh yeah this is the sport model infinity
has<00:04:25.849> always<00:04:26.180> been<00:04:26.300> very<00:04:26.539> innovative<00:04:26.900> with<00:04:27.289> our

00:04:27.399 --> 00:04:27.409 
has always been very innovative with our

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:29.369 
has always been very innovative with our
technology<00:04:27.620> and<00:04:28.069> the<00:04:28.280> g<00:04:28.430> 37<00:04:28.849> is<00:04:29.090> no<00:04:29.240> exception

00:04:29.369 --> 00:04:29.379 
technology and the g 37 is no exception

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:31.779 
technology and the g 37 is no exception
one<00:04:30.379> of<00:04:30.469> things<00:04:30.500> I<00:04:30.680> love<00:04:30.919> is<00:04:31.099> that<00:04:31.129> on<00:04:31.639> this

00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:31.789 
one of things I love is that on this

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:33.909 
one of things I love is that on this
navigation<00:04:32.300> screen<00:04:32.689> for<00:04:32.930> example<00:04:33.379> you

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 
navigation screen for example you

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:35.860 
navigation screen for example you
actually<00:04:34.280> have<00:04:34.430> three<00:04:34.759> different<00:04:35.330> ways<00:04:35.509> that

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
actually have three different ways that

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.899 
actually have three different ways that
you<00:04:35.900> can<00:04:36.139> control<00:04:36.469> the<00:04:36.650> stream<00:04:36.919> I<00:04:37.129> can<00:04:37.610> use<00:04:37.759> the

00:04:37.899 --> 00:04:37.909 
you can control the stream I can use the

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:40.119 
you can control the stream I can use the
steering<00:04:38.270> controls<00:04:38.689> to<00:04:39.259> toggle<00:04:39.469> up<00:04:39.770> and<00:04:39.919> down

00:04:40.119 --> 00:04:40.129 
steering controls to toggle up and down

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:43.510 
steering controls to toggle up and down
hit<00:04:40.789> enter<00:04:41.210> there<00:04:41.990> you<00:04:42.139> go<00:04:42.289> I<00:04:42.560> can<00:04:43.099> use<00:04:43.310> this

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 
hit enter there you go I can use this

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.820 
hit enter there you go I can use this
thing<00:04:43.849> that<00:04:44.030> they<00:04:44.120> call<00:04:44.360> the<00:04:44.509> flower<00:04:44.840> which<00:04:45.650> is

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830 
thing that they call the flower which is

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.360 
thing that they call the flower which is
essentially<00:04:46.430> a<00:04:46.689> multi-directional<00:04:48.280> you<00:04:49.280> know

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
essentially a multi-directional you know

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.279 
essentially a multi-directional you know
button<00:04:49.759> where<00:04:50.539> the<00:04:50.599> enter<00:04:50.870> in<00:04:50.960> the<00:04:50.990> middle

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:51.289 
button where the enter in the middle

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:55.899 
button where the enter in the middle
also<00:04:51.710> has<00:04:51.830> a<00:04:51.860> dial<00:04:52.219> or<00:04:52.610> I<00:04:53.300> can<00:04:53.689> actually<00:04:54.909> hit

00:04:55.899 --> 00:04:55.909 
also has a dial or I can actually hit

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:58.480 
also has a dial or I can actually hit
the<00:04:55.939> touch<00:04:56.270> screen<00:04:56.449> and<00:04:56.870> use<00:04:57.860> that<00:04:57.889> so<00:04:58.250> three

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
the touch screen and use that so three

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.610 
the touch screen and use that so three
different<00:04:58.789> ways<00:04:58.969> to<00:04:59.000> enter<00:04:59.659> information<00:04:59.960> into

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
different ways to enter information into

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.480 
different ways to enter information into
the<00:05:00.919> screen<00:05:01.310> I<00:05:01.580> love<00:05:02.150> it<00:05:02.270> the<00:05:02.990> g37<00:05:03.620> is<00:05:03.889> a<00:05:03.919> proper

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
the screen I love it the g37 is a proper

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:05.980 
the screen I love it the g37 is a proper
sports<00:05:04.759> sedan<00:05:05.180> meaning<00:05:05.569> its<00:05:05.750> rear<00:05:05.960> wheel

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
sports sedan meaning its rear wheel

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.890 
sports sedan meaning its rear wheel
drive<00:05:06.199> so<00:05:06.830> it's<00:05:07.129> very<00:05:07.310> well<00:05:07.610> balanced<00:05:08.120> we<00:05:08.750> have

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
drive so it's very well balanced we have

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.570 
drive so it's very well balanced we have
had<00:05:09.139> this<00:05:09.289> particular<00:05:09.770> vehicle<00:05:09.949> on<00:05:10.219> the<00:05:10.250> track

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
had this particular vehicle on the track

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.140 
had this particular vehicle on the track
it<00:05:11.029> did<00:05:11.240> wonderfully<00:05:12.340> certainly<00:05:13.340> went<00:05:13.550> to<00:05:13.849> you

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:14.150 
it did wonderfully certainly went to you

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:16.480 
it did wonderfully certainly went to you
know<00:05:14.270> head-to-head<00:05:14.930> with<00:05:15.169> BMW<00:05:15.770> Mercedes<00:05:16.279> Audi

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
know head-to-head with BMW Mercedes Audi

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.939 
know head-to-head with BMW Mercedes Audi
etc<00:05:17.090> so<00:05:17.330> there's<00:05:17.960> really<00:05:18.139> you<00:05:18.650> know<00:05:18.740> it's<00:05:18.889> a

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:18.949 
etc so there's really you know it's a

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:21.100 
etc so there's really you know it's a
good<00:05:19.099> to<00:05:19.370> good<00:05:19.490> performing<00:05:20.029> vehicle<00:05:20.539> I<00:05:20.719> think

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
good to good performing vehicle I think

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:22.719 
good to good performing vehicle I think
there's<00:05:21.229> some<00:05:21.349> areas<00:05:21.620> of<00:05:21.680> improvement<00:05:21.949> and<00:05:22.460> I

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:22.729 
there's some areas of improvement and I

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:24.339 
there's some areas of improvement and I
think<00:05:22.819> infinity<00:05:23.389> will<00:05:23.509> address<00:05:23.810> that<00:05:23.840> when

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:24.349 
think infinity will address that when

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:25.809 
think infinity will address that when
they<00:05:24.500> do<00:05:24.560> their<00:05:24.800> next<00:05:25.069> update<00:05:25.460> which<00:05:25.669> is

00:05:25.809 --> 00:05:25.819 
they do their next update which is

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:30.759 
they do their next update which is
probably<00:05:26.089> going<00:05:26.449> to<00:05:26.509> happen<00:05:26.810> in<00:05:26.900> 2013<00:05:27.770> of<00:05:27.919> 2014
