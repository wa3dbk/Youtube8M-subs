the squad girl the name it's mixed most

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.630 
the squad girl the name it's mixed most
of<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.330> side<00:00:15.780> is<00:00:16.139> Brazilian<00:00:17.010> but<00:00:17.369> there<00:00:17.550> is

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
of the side is Brazilian but there is

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.450 
of the side is Brazilian but there is
also<00:00:17.820> a<00:00:18.029> bit<00:00:18.240> of<00:00:18.359> Russian<00:00:18.840> league

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460 
also a bit of Russian league

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.040 
also a bit of Russian league
incorporated<00:00:20.460> it<00:00:20.550> into<00:00:20.880> it<00:00:21.240> as<00:00:21.390> well<00:00:21.630> with

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
incorporated it into it as well with

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.859 
incorporated it into it as well with
including<00:00:22.830> an<00:00:22.949> end<00:00:23.100> farm<00:00:23.369> so<00:00:24.210> you'll<00:00:24.449> see<00:00:24.660> that

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
including an end farm so you'll see that

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.210 
including an end farm so you'll see that
in<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.109> second<00:00:25.560> we'll<00:00:25.710> just<00:00:25.859> social<00:00:26.160> the

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
in a second we'll just social the

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.269 
in a second we'll just social the
goalkeeper<00:00:26.760> first<00:00:27.000> which<00:00:27.300> is<00:00:27.330> Diego<00:00:27.930> Alvarez

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279 
goalkeeper first which is Diego Alvarez

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:30.950 
goalkeeper first which is Diego Alvarez
the<00:00:29.330> formation<00:00:30.330> that<00:00:30.420> were<00:00:30.539> playing<00:00:30.810> the

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
the formation that were playing the

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.440 
the formation that were playing the
squad<00:00:31.260> in<00:00:31.410> as<00:00:31.650> we<00:00:31.920> see<00:00:32.070> changing<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:32.910> four<00:00:33.300> one

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
squad in as we see changing is four one

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.840 
squad in as we see changing is four one
two<00:00:33.540> one<00:00:33.840> two<00:00:33.920> so<00:00:34.920> it's<00:00:35.160> probably<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.520> best

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
two one two so it's probably the best

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.850 
two one two so it's probably the best
most<00:00:36.210> expensive<00:00:36.840> formation<00:00:37.350> on<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.469> game

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
most expensive formation on the game

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.220 
most expensive formation on the game
then<00:00:38.700> probably<00:00:39.210> one<00:00:39.719> of<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.870> reasons<00:00:39.899> why<00:00:40.200> I

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
then probably one of the reasons why I

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.440 
then probably one of the reasons why I
chose<00:00:40.320> it<00:00:40.559> so<00:00:40.950> Diego<00:00:41.280> al<00:00:41.520> there's<00:00:41.760> nine

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
chose it so Diego al there's nine

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.270 
chose it so Diego al there's nine
thousand<00:00:42.899> six<00:00:43.110> hundred<00:00:43.170> coins<00:00:43.559> spent<00:00:44.010> on<00:00:44.160> him

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
thousand six hundred coins spent on him

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.420 
thousand six hundred coins spent on him
91<00:00:45.239> dive<00:00:45.480> in<00:00:45.750> ninety<00:00:46.230> reflexes<00:00:46.860> 75
