 chapter 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:10.550
 objectives of fundamentalist analysis 

00:00:11.609 --> 00:00:13.449
 introduction 

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:18.320
 welcome to our fundamentalist analysis course pricing 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.800
 fair value of shares 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.900
 in it you will get the knowledge necessary to understand the technique 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.909
 analysis and evaluation of actions 

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:31.110
 these analyzes have as basic premise 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.770
 the creation of value for the shareholder 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.500
 this value is measured by the company's ability to generate 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.770
 cash to your investor 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.850
 in the form of distributed dividends 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.260
 we will also demonstrate the different analyzes that should be considered 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.260
 to create the growth trends of a company 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.120
 the main objective of fundamentalist analysis 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.280
 is to evaluate the best investment alternatives in the 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.350
 and long term 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.250
 micro and microeconomic situations should be 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.060
 and the panorama of the company in order to verify all the external aspects 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.910
 and internal factors that may influence the future ability to generate profits 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.010
 from the company 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.010
 be analyzed and restructured. 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.830
 the financial statements and balance sheets 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.130
 in order to verify the historical evolution of the company 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.400
 and create future growth projections 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.870
 It is also up to the fundamentalist analysis to establish the fair 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:36.590
 action 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.170
 supporting the decisions to buy or sell a certain asset 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.610
 the basic premise of fundamentalist analysis 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.760
 is that the fair value for a company is given by the definition of its capacity 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.990
 to generate profits in the future 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.450
 but why should we value future prospects for 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.370
 value of a company 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:03.200
 this is simply due to the fact that we obtain higher returns in the values 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.690
 received in the form of dividends that are paid to shareholders 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.090
 Besides that 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.390
 studies show that encouraging value creation in future returns 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.190
 of firms, the investor contributes to companies increasing their returns 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.419
 generated for a country's overall savings 

00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:26.290
 an economy that values ​​the creation of value in its business presents 

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:29.219
 higher growth of your GDP 

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:34.499
 fundamentalist analysts need to create business growth models 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:39.629
 for the creation of these models they must assume premises regarding the 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:44.730
 sales growth potential of expected return growth over the 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.639
 capital invested in the company 

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:50.809
 of the expected behavior of the weighted average cost of the company's capital 

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:53.809
 among other growth vectors 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:58.029
 to create the business premises of growth of a company 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.040
 analysts use 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.149
 much more than your intuition 

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:07.009
 they use tools such as historical analysis of statements 

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:08.929
 financial 

00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:12.019
 elaboration of economic scenarios 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:16.400
 analysis of the perspectives of the sector of the company and possible 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.649
 mutations in the company's core business 

00:03:19.649 --> 00:03:22.529
 the analysis of market indicators 

00:03:22.529 --> 00:03:25.770
 projections of future results of the company 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.699
 among others 

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:32.329
 fundamentalist analysis series d as a method of economic analysis for 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:33.059
 companies 

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:35.879
 and feasibility of projects 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:40.169
 it is usually focused on aspects that can be measured 

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:44.939
 sources of resources the prices charged by suppliers 

00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:46.860
 The captain 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.529
 of the organization 

00:03:48.529 --> 00:03:51.529
 technological knowledge et cetera 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:57.859
 it is imperative to consider subjective aspects as alternatives to 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:03:58.830
 investment 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.380
 value ethical 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.380
 performance projections among others 

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:08.639
 fundamentalist analysis can be used to analyze 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:12.870
 are in the stage of implementation or fully operational 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.690
 since it is used in situations in which it is desired to evaluate 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.559
 companies and projects 

00:04:19.559 --> 00:04:23.799
 we can say that it is the most important method for analyzing 

00:04:23.799 --> 00:04:26.669
 investments in the capital market 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:29.560
 this is not a devaluation technical analysis 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.760
 I note a finding mainly due to the differences between the 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.469
 two schools of analysis 

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:42.249
 The technical analysis is based on statistical models of behavior and 

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:45.469
 relationship between price and what evolves from a 

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:49.759
 this makes it useful mainly in short-term investments 

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:52.610
 already in the fundamentalist li zhi 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.050
 has as goal the creation of models of maintenance and growth of the business 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.009
 and the results of the company 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:01.040
 thus 

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:05.980
 it is advised for investments as medium- and long-term objectives 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.069
 in this way it is mainly used for pricing 

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:13.020
 future of stock 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.830
 determining the fair prices of the assets traded on the markets 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.860
 primary or secondary stock exchange 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:26.020
 This analysis is also used to determine the trading 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.020
 buying and selling in mergers and acquisitions 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:32.840
 determining the economic viability of the projects
