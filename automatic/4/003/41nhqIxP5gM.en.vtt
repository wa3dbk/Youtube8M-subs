00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
on this matchup we had to keep pressure

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.860 
on this matchup we had to keep pressure
on<00:00:08.460> the<00:00:08.670> death<00:00:08.849> knight<00:00:09.090> as<00:00:09.389> long<00:00:09.570> as<00:00:09.599> we<00:00:09.719> kept

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
on the death knight as long as we kept

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.540 
on the death knight as long as we kept
pressure<00:00:10.110> on<00:00:10.230> him<00:00:10.410> we<00:00:10.920> should<00:00:11.130> be<00:00:11.280> able<00:00:11.370> to

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
pressure on him we should be able to

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.280 
pressure on him we should be able to
whittle<00:00:11.759> them<00:00:11.849> down<00:00:11.940> to<00:00:12.630> low<00:00:12.780> health<00:00:13.049> and

a<00:00:20.310> lot<00:00:20.400> of<00:00:20.460> coverage<00:00:20.760> of<00:00:20.939> that<00:00:21.150> but<00:00:21.420> war<00:00:21.779> is

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
a lot of coverage of that but war is

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.900 
a lot of coverage of that but war is

one for me and my arenas at least is
shockwave<00:00:26.640> caused<00:00:27.300> shockwaves<00:00:27.480> what<00:00:28.019> wins<00:00:28.260> a

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
shockwave caused shockwaves what wins a

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.109 
shockwave caused shockwaves what wins a
lot<00:00:28.500> of<00:00:28.650> my<00:00:28.769> battles<00:00:29.189> having<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.609> shockwave

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
lot of my battles having the shockwave

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.749 
lot of my battles having the shockwave
and<00:00:30.330> what<00:00:31.260> he<00:00:31.320> calls<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.650> storm<00:00:31.679> bolt<00:00:32.279> a

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759

double combo son or whatever you want to
call<00:00:35.130> it<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.520> since<00:00:35.880> they're<00:00:36.090> increasing

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
call it and since they're increasing

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.479 
call it and since they're increasing
shockwaves<00:00:36.930> cool<00:00:37.200> down<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.590> 40<00:00:38.040> seconds

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
shockwaves cool down to 40 seconds

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.610 
shockwaves cool down to 40 seconds
instead<00:00:38.640> of<00:00:38.790> 20<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.300> won't<00:00:39.750> be<00:00:39.840> able<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:40.079> stun<00:00:40.350> as

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
instead of 20 I won't be able to stun as

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.729 
instead of 20 I won't be able to stun as
often<00:00:41.100> which<00:00:41.309> really<00:00:41.809> hurts<00:00:42.809> all<00:00:43.140> warriors

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
often which really hurts all warriors

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.229 
often which really hurts all warriors
you<00:00:44.010> know<00:00:44.129> trying<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.550> get<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.730> other<00:00:44.850> people

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
you know trying to get to other people

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.490 
you know trying to get to other people
because<00:00:45.300> Wars<00:00:45.600> already<00:00:45.930> have<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.079> hard<00:00:46.320> time

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
because Wars already have a hard time

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.529 
because Wars already have a hard time
trying<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.280> catch<00:00:47.489> up<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.820> people<00:00:48.000> as<00:00:48.239> it<00:00:48.390> is

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
trying to catch up the people as it is

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.569 
trying to catch up the people as it is
especially<00:00:49.440> when<00:00:49.680> it<00:00:49.770> comes<00:00:49.829> up<00:00:50.010> frost<00:00:50.280> mages

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
especially when it comes up frost mages

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.790 
especially when it comes up frost mages
and<00:00:50.730> stupid<00:00:51.180> stuff<00:00:51.390> like<00:00:51.510> that<00:00:51.629> so<00:00:52.440> hopefully

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
and stupid stuff like that so hopefully

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.979 
and stupid stuff like that so hopefully
that<00:00:53.190> there<00:00:53.399> won't<00:00:53.579> be<00:00:53.760> too<00:00:54.000> bad<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.420> also

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
that there won't be too bad is also

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.900 
that there won't be too bad is also
another<00:00:55.199> nerfs<00:00:55.559> are<00:00:55.770> another<00:00:56.039> major<00:00:56.489> ability

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
another nerfs are another major ability

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.270 
another nerfs are another major ability
we<00:00:57.030> have<00:00:57.210> which<00:00:57.390> is<00:00:57.420> second<00:00:58.020> wind<00:00:58.260> so<00:00:58.859> second

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
we have which is second wind so second

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.709 
we have which is second wind so second
wind<00:00:59.460> is<00:00:59.609> what<00:00:59.730> gives<00:00:59.910> us<00:01:00.090> that<00:01:00.210> he'll<00:01:00.539> at

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
wind is what gives us that he'll at

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.720 
wind is what gives us that he'll at
thirty-five<00:01:01.379> percent<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.890> lower<00:01:02.039> health<00:01:02.309> and

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
thirty-five percent of lower health and

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.700 
thirty-five percent of lower health and
that<00:01:02.850> gives<00:01:03.210> us<00:01:03.390> so<00:01:03.570> it's<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.960> nerf<00:01:04.170> by<00:01:04.379> one

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
that gives us so it's the nerf by one

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.109 
that gives us so it's the nerf by one
percent<00:01:05.129> but<00:01:05.339> that<00:01:05.460> one<00:01:05.640> percent<00:01:06.000> could

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
percent but that one percent could

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.210 
percent but that one percent could
probably<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.570> huge<00:01:06.840> difference<00:01:07.080> as<00:01:07.380> I<00:01:07.920> know<00:01:07.979> the

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
probably a huge difference as I know the

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.219 
probably a huge difference as I know the
second<00:01:08.520> one<00:01:08.640> doesn't<00:01:08.880> kill<00:01:09.180> that<00:01:09.479> much<00:01:09.750> but

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
second one doesn't kill that much but

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.020 
second one doesn't kill that much but
it's<00:01:10.380> like<00:01:10.530> just<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:10.950> just<00:01:11.159> barely<00:01:11.490> lets<00:01:11.880> you

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
it's like just it just barely lets you

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.630 
it's like just it just barely lets you
survive<00:01:12.390> so<00:01:13.140> any<00:01:13.470> nerf<00:01:13.680> that<00:01:13.979> is<00:01:14.159> absolutely

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
survive so any nerf that is absolutely

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.030 
survive so any nerf that is absolutely
horrible<00:01:14.970> well<00:01:15.900> back<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.350> video<00:01:16.530> here<00:01:16.950> is

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
horrible well back to the video here is

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.280
