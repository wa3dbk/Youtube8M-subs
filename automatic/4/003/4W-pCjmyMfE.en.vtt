00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.739
 hello girls spray is very well 

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:05.540
 today we are going to make some decorations for 

00:00:03.739 --> 00:00:07.129
 our room the truth these 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.780
 decorations are very beautiful and very 

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:10.670
 easy to do since we need 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.040
 materials that are very easy to 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.660
 get and the procedure is very 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.550
 easy that you should have a lot 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.680
 creativity because there will be a moment 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.810
 in which we are going to have to take 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.029
 our creativity to be able to do 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.060
 those things good as you've already seen in the 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:27.410
 title because they are decorative pictures 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.240
 then you have to draw some 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.460
 things that the truth here integrates of me 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.760
 I'm just giving you the idea but you 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.410
 you can change it to your way or your tastes 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.390
 materials that we are going to use are the 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.770
 pictures of wood color paints 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.900
 that integrates you preferably that it be 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.720
 dark two super hard cartons one 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.910
 brush some scissors and some things 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.280
 pointy and also resisted a 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.620
 enamel and white paint or some 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.630
 clear paint what we are going to do is 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.090
 rubbing the paint this has to be 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:58.940
 dark preference and let's paint everything 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:02.630
 the picture evenly does not have to 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:06.290
 there is no free space 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:08.630
 if it is necessary to give double layer depends 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:13.240
 Paint must be must be 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.240
 two paintings as they had already mentioned 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.720
 now what we will do with the squares 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.380
 that is to say how to do the form that 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.380
 we want 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:36.000
 you can put them in different ways already 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.630
 be a few pictures three pictures of the other 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.810
 side plus pictures from the other side 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:45.190
 and all the box full of squares in 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.800
 yes all the ways you want 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.320
 it's just the idea it's like that you 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.450
 already play with that depends on likes and 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:57.160
 we do not all have the same tastes 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:59.810
 I'm going to leave it like that 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:03.110
 as ladder type more or less 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.540
 so I'll leave it after every 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.450
 little picture we are going to paint the color 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:11.030
 dark I'm going to paint it in color 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.739
 black so that it looks different from 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.500
 summary of mind and all the pictures 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:18.230
 they have to be very well covered in 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.650
 the painting should not have any gap 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:24.459
 of the original color or anything that so 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.459
 It looks good obviously 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.170
 let's cover well paint well and so 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.659
 well let's do with others 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.450
 squares and we are going to put a sheet 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:37.680
 to not stain there we're going to leave them 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.680
 to dry well 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:48.050
 and then we're going to put them back in 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:50.990
 the paper that hard is like cardboard and what 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:54.040
 we are going to stick with resistol very well that 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:55.900
 resistol is very powerful the truth 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.599
 then let's start doing what 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.609
 they are the figurines or the drawings 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:03.700
 that's where you should take the 

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:05.409
 creativity yes because I also tell them or 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.439
 it is only the idea already depends on 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:10.090
 likes I started with a pin and what 

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:13.930
 I opened and I'm doing like that 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:17.430
 points in the entire first picture 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.430
 points and points and points 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:38.859
 then in the second box I made a 

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:41.049
 zebra style and I used what is a 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:43.480
 sure and I opened it for that reason I told you 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:47.409
 what pointy things to make strokes 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:49.989
 as well as delgaditos and that helped me a lot 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:52.780
 because that would be nice it looked thick and 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:55.469
 after I was little , I did the style of 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.469
 zebra 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.120
 in the third frame I forgot so 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.940
 as I record good as I am 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.760
 recording but did not record anything and style 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:11.360
 what I did is this I did with the pin 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:14.660
 open and already but during of bonito 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:17.130
 in the fourth and six horizontal stripes 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.430
 they do not have to be very perfect 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.430
 true 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:24.240
 that the cookies look like this 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:35.730
 with an ethical 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:37.860
 with a transparent gloss glaze what 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:40.220
 what we are going to do is put it in the 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:43.220
 small squares in all 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:45.950
 this way they will look very shiny 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:48.700
 and the finish looks very father apart from 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.700
 that is not going to mistreat 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:54.770
 we are going to put it in the whole picture 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.660
 and if you see the difference in the others, 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.940
 I put it in the first one I hope and it looks 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.620
 much the difference and then we put 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.870
 plaid environments 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.600
 in the squares of the second picture I made 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:08.270
 these figurines with this capital I'm going to 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:10.460
 make like a hairline without third 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.770
 picture I put some paint on the 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:15.139
 piece of paper and then the part that 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:18.050
 it has been proven that I passed over 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:19.850
 the painting then in the third 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.970
 little picture we are going to do as well as 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:24.260
 little circles with that little thing like that is going to be 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:26.720
 a little easier 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:30.380
 you can play like I did him 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:32.060
 I put several over and over if you 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:34.760
 you get to be a little more paint 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.860
 on the one hand with the pointed thing 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:41.860
 you can do as well as stripes so that 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:41.860
 do not only see the painting like that 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:46.599
 In the fourth picture what I did was 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:49.839
 use a brush and no blog 

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:51.580
 I used and I put paint on the barrier 

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:53.110
 little bit of paint and then I had it 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:55.449
 on top of the box say as a 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:58.949
 little touches then you see a lot 

00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:58.949
 finished and it is very 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:05.139
 thus 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:07.900
 the truth we can do things 

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:10.450
 that maybe they look so difficult but 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:12.220
 we can make it simple and the truth 

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:14.830
 It is very nice the squares to me 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:16.960
 they loved that and it depends on tastes 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:19.690
 likes you can do different ways 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:21.370
 this milk there are also its little circles 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:24.040
 You can find these squares in 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:26.710
 Haberdashery only where the wood but 

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:30.030
 he is very father 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:32.810
 that would be your opinion 

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:32.810
 it is not the idea 

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:38.880
