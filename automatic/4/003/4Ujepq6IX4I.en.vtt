integrated iron sights and you can see

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.370 
integrated iron sights and you can see
the<00:02:36.100> that's<00:02:37.100> the<00:02:37.370> type<00:02:37.520> of<00:02:37.600> optics<00:02:38.600> it<00:02:38.690> is<00:02:38.810> it's

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
the that's the type of optics it is it's

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.190 
the that's the type of optics it is it's
very<00:02:39.470> accurate<00:02:40.810> the<00:02:41.810> thing<00:02:41.959> I<00:02:42.050> like<00:02:42.080> about

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
very accurate the thing I like about

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.120 
very accurate the thing I like about
this<00:02:42.319> is<00:02:42.760> you<00:02:43.760> line<00:02:44.090> up<00:02:44.120> your<00:02:44.450> crosshairs<00:02:45.130> with

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
this is you line up your crosshairs with

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.880 
this is you line up your crosshairs with
the<00:02:46.730> gun<00:02:47.090> and<00:02:47.360> then<00:02:47.450> use<00:02:47.660> the<00:02:47.900> tool<00:02:48.290> and<00:02:48.620> they

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
the gun and then use the tool and they

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.000 
the gun and then use the tool and they
comes<00:02:49.070> in<00:02:49.160> the<00:02:49.220> box<00:02:49.400> to<00:02:49.940> adjust<00:02:50.330> the<00:02:50.830> the<00:02:51.830> left

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
comes in the box to adjust the the left

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.030 
comes in the box to adjust the the left
right<00:02:52.280> with<00:02:52.519> the<00:02:52.580> windage<00:02:52.930> to<00:02:53.930> your<00:02:54.350> prop<00:02:54.620> to

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
right with the windage to your prop to

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.060 
right with the windage to your prop to
the<00:02:55.190> EMA<00:02:55.840> to<00:02:56.840> wear<00:02:57.140> it<00:02:57.320> it's<00:02:57.830> completely

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
the EMA to wear it it's completely

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.550 
the EMA to wear it it's completely
accurate<00:02:58.600> so<00:02:59.600> your<00:02:59.720> babies<00:02:59.959> are<00:03:00.170> going<00:03:00.470> to

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
accurate so your babies are going to

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.990 
accurate so your babies are going to
write<00:03:00.709> down<00:03:00.739> the<00:03:00.950> barrel<00:03:01.190> and<00:03:01.310> the<00:03:01.370> Scopes

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
write down the barrel and the Scopes

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.630 
write down the barrel and the Scopes
lined<00:03:02.269> up<00:03:02.390> like<00:03:02.510> that<00:03:02.690> and<00:03:03.280> then<00:03:04.280> just<00:03:04.310> to

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
lined up like that and then just to

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.400 
lined up like that and then just to
change<00:03:04.880> just<00:03:05.150> the<00:03:05.180> elevation<00:03:05.660> is<00:03:05.810> to<00:03:06.290> them

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
change just the elevation is to them

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.400 
change just the elevation is to them
back<00:03:06.590> so<00:03:06.860> it's<00:03:07.010> very<00:03:07.430> easy<00:03:07.640> to<00:03:08.120> adapt<00:03:09.110> for

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
back so it's very easy to adapt for

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.610 
back so it's very easy to adapt for
close<00:03:09.800> range<00:03:09.920> and<00:03:10.370> clip<00:03:10.970> to<00:03:11.120> longer<00:03:11.420> ranges

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.590
