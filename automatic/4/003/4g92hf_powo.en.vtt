00:00:08.619 --> 00:00:12.949
 very good and that tells me that I'm a 

00:00:10.699 --> 00:00:14.839
 new video today I bring you the fourth 

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:18.380
 free edition program 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:20.920
 photography this time plays inkscape and 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.920
 lets go see it 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.760
 well this program is also very easy 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.779
 of using the tools are very 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.000
 visible 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:35.940
 you have to go looking for anything so this 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.629
 It is also very good for people who do not 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.760
 want to use very programs 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:42.940
 professionals but that gives good 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.489
 results and good for what 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.530
 is being drawn and all this is 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:50.230
 program is also highly recommended since 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.510
 that has many tools and how 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:55.269
 you are seeing the spiral and all that and 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.370
 the brushes to draw without having 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:59.770
 no photography and nothing 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.290
 and then what stands out most this 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.629
 program is that it has so many 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.560
 filters as you are seeing there has 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:11.200
 all kinds of artistic effects and for 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.899
 raise the brightness and all that blur 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.330
 etcetera so you can edit yours 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:19.119
 photograph perfectly as you are 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.280
 seeing with good results and with the 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:22.869
 layers as you can see also was the 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.350
 modify as with the clean and others 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.180
 programs 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.160
 you can move them and all that 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.660
 good after like many others 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.090
 programs you can also scale the 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:34.480
 images you are seeing there you can put 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.010
 the dimensions or do it manually 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.320
 that is also very good afterwards 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:42.440
 other tools like absorb colors 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:46.070
 and as about colors and and others 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:49.250
 selection tools and good this 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.140
 program does not accept the psd format but 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:55.600
 I accept many others such as the 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.600
 of pdf the bmp png 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.920
 so this program also tells us 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.840
 I recommend quite after tools 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.610
 of clipping and all that because they are the 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.100
 I'm not going to tell you anything else 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.200
 because everything is very visible as you 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.030
 I say and you are going to tell it right away for 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.400
 what you want for sure this promos 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.480
 It serves and best of all, it's what 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.130
 It's free 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.250
 nothing follows this program also to a 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:21.330
 segment that you try it and nothing we see 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.330
 both two days with a new video
