00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
without question which i think is really

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:57.770 
without question which i think is really
important<00:01:56.700> because<00:01:56.759> it's<00:01:57.270> gonna<00:01:57.450> be<00:01:57.600> like<00:01:57.750> a

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
important because it's gonna be like a

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:58.969 
important because it's gonna be like a
little<00:01:57.990> bit<00:01:58.079> like<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.200> shotgun<00:01:58.500> where<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:58.860> run

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
little bit like a shotgun where you run

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.590 
little bit like a shotgun where you run
around<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.219> corner<00:01:59.520> you're<00:02:00.000> about<00:02:00.210> three

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
around the corner you're about three

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.120 
around the corner you're about three
feet<00:02:00.780> from<00:02:00.960> them<00:02:01.200> if<00:02:01.320> you<00:02:01.409> fire<00:02:01.619> it<00:02:01.649> you<00:02:01.950> hit

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
feet from them if you fire it you hit

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.069 
feet from them if you fire it you hit
them<00:02:02.280> you're<00:02:02.460> going<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.670> get<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.880> kill

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920

you are attempting to try and get some
long-range<00:02:27.300> shots<00:02:27.810> then<00:02:28.050> you're<00:02:28.170> only<00:02:28.320> going

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
long-range shots then you're only going

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
actual person that you hit so it's not a

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:33.950 
actual person that you hit so it's not a
huge<00:02:32.790> amount<00:02:33.030> of<00:02:33.270> damage<00:02:33.480> which<00:02:33.630> means<00:02:33.840> you're

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
huge amount of damage which means you're

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.480 
huge amount of damage which means you're
going<00:02:34.080> to<00:02:34.140> have<00:02:34.200> to<00:02:34.410> hit<00:02:34.560> at<00:02:34.740> least<00:02:34.890> two<00:02:35.160> bolts

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
going to have to hit at least two bolts

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.370 
going to have to hit at least two bolts
into<00:02:35.670> them<00:02:35.880> before<00:02:36.150> you<00:02:36.180> kill<00:02:36.510> them<00:02:36.660> which<00:02:37.170> if

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
into them before you kill them which if

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.380 
into them before you kill them which if
you're<00:02:37.530> a<00:02:37.560> good<00:02:37.770> player<00:02:37.980> is<00:02:38.280> fairly<00:02:38.700> easy<00:02:38.820> but

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
you're a good player is fairly easy but

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.110 
you're a good player is fairly easy but
if<00:02:39.600> they're<00:02:40.440> like<00:02:40.770> ridiculously<00:02:41.430> far<00:02:41.820> away

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
if they're like ridiculously far away

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.940 
if they're like ridiculously far away
like<00:02:42.360> 120<00:02:43.080> meters<00:02:43.410> then<00:02:43.590> you're<00:02:43.740> going<00:02:43.860> to

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
like 120 meters then you're going to

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.380 
like 120 meters then you're going to
find<00:02:44.100> you're<00:02:44.310> going<00:02:44.430> to<00:02:44.490> struggle<00:02:44.700> to<00:02:45.000> get<00:02:45.150> a

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
find you're going to struggle to get a

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.610 
find you're going to struggle to get a
kill<00:02:45.810> with<00:02:46.050> and<00:02:46.650> with<00:02:47.400> this<00:02:47.550> cross<00:02:47.790> back<00:02:48.620> okay

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
kill with and with this cross back okay

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.130 
kill with and with this cross back okay
so<00:02:49.680> obviously<00:02:50.100> the<00:02:50.880> explosive<00:02:51.600> bolt<00:02:51.810> is<00:02:51.930> meant

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
so obviously the explosive bolt is meant

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:18.960 
is going to instantly disable the

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.410 
is going to instantly disable the
vehicle<00:03:19.350> which<00:03:19.890> means<00:03:20.160> you're<00:03:21.090> going<00:03:21.240> to<00:03:21.300> hit

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
vehicle which means you're going to hit

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.140 
vehicle which means you're going to hit
it<00:03:21.600> with<00:03:21.810> the<00:03:21.840> sea<00:03:22.110> floor<00:03:22.320> crossbow<00:03:23.310> and<00:03:23.580> then

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.580 
it with the sea floor crossbow and then
it<00:03:24.420> should<00:03:24.690> crash<00:03:24.990> to<00:03:25.140> the<00:03:25.170> ground<00:03:25.260> and

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
it should crash to the ground and

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:26.480 
it should crash to the ground and
hopefully<00:03:25.860> you'll<00:03:25.950> get<00:03:26.040> you<00:03:26.160> a<00:03:26.190> couple<00:03:26.460> of

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:26.490 
hopefully you'll get you a couple of

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.630 
hopefully you'll get you a couple of
kills<00:03:26.730> when<00:03:26.970> the<00:03:27.360> people<00:03:27.510> don't<00:03:27.720> jump<00:03:27.990> out

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
kills when the people don't jump out

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.430 
kills when the people don't jump out
moving<00:03:29.640> on<00:03:29.760> to<00:03:29.940> the<00:03:29.970> main<00:03:30.450> battle<00:03:30.900> tank<00:03:31.110> there

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
moving on to the main battle tank there

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.660 
moving on to the main battle tank there
are<00:03:31.560> different<00:03:31.680> points<00:03:32.190> of<00:03:32.280> which<00:03:32.430> you<00:03:32.550> can

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
are different points of which you can

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.640 
are different points of which you can
hit<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:32.940> tank<00:03:33.120> obviously<00:03:33.570> like<00:03:33.720> an<00:03:33.870> RPG<00:03:34.380> so

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
hit the tank obviously like an RPG so

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.710 
hit the tank obviously like an RPG so
let's<00:03:34.860> talk<00:03:35.010> about<00:03:35.130> those<00:03:35.400> so<00:03:36.090> from<00:03:36.330> the<00:03:36.420> front

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
let's talk about those so from the front

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.180 
let's talk about those so from the front
you're<00:03:37.050> going<00:03:37.200> to<00:03:37.260> get<00:03:37.350> a<00:03:37.410> ten<00:03:37.680> percent<00:03:37.800> damage

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
you're going to get a ten percent damage

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.190 
you're going to get a ten percent damage
hit<00:03:38.580> but<00:03:39.150> then<00:03:39.270> if<00:03:39.360> it's<00:03:39.480> angled<00:03:39.930> then<00:03:40.110> you're

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
hit but then if it's angled then you're

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.440 
hit but then if it's angled then you're
going<00:03:40.290> to<00:03:40.380> get<00:03:40.440> eight<00:03:40.820> from<00:03:41.820> the<00:03:41.940> side<00:03:42.150> you'll

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
going to get eight from the side you'll

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.840 
going to get eight from the side you'll
get<00:03:42.570> 18<00:03:43.050> but<00:03:43.080> angled<00:03:43.920> again<00:03:44.160> is<00:03:44.340> only<00:03:44.490> eight

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
get 18 but angled again is only eight

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.610 
get 18 but angled again is only eight
percent<00:03:45.060> and<00:03:45.480> if<00:03:45.870> you<00:03:45.960> hit<00:03:46.080> it<00:03:46.170> from<00:03:46.260> the<00:03:46.350> rear

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
percent and if you hit it from the rear

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.250 
percent and if you hit it from the rear
like<00:03:46.890> any<00:03:47.130> normal<00:03:47.520> tank<00:03:48.000> or<00:03:48.270> RPG<00:03:48.810> you're<00:03:49.140> going

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
like any normal tank or RPG you're going

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.380 
like any normal tank or RPG you're going
to<00:03:49.320> get<00:03:49.470> a<00:03:49.650> hell<00:03:50.430> of<00:03:50.460> a<00:03:50.610> lot<00:03:50.730> more<00:03:50.760> damage<00:03:51.120> of

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
to get a hell of a lot more damage of

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:52.460 
to get a hell of a lot more damage of
the<00:03:51.420> rear<00:03:51.690> you're<00:03:51.840> going<00:03:51.960> to<00:03:52.020> get<00:03:52.080> a<00:03:52.140> twenty

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
the rear you're going to get a twenty

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.410 
the rear you're going to get a twenty
eight<00:03:52.620> percent<00:03:52.650> damage<00:03:53.100> hit<00:03:53.520> or<00:03:54.000> if<00:03:54.270> it's

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
eight percent damage hit or if it's

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.120 
eight percent damage hit or if it's
angles<00:03:54.840> you<00:03:54.930> only<00:03:55.140> get<00:03:55.290> 12<00:03:55.590> but<00:03:55.770> that's<00:03:55.920> still

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
angles you only get 12 but that's still

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.310 
angles you only get 12 but that's still
more<00:03:56.370> than<00:03:56.430> what<00:03:56.760> you<00:03:56.790> would<00:03:57.690> normally<00:03:57.900> get

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
more than what you would normally get

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.780 
more than what you would normally get
with<00:03:58.440> any<00:03:58.590> other<00:03:58.770> angle<00:03:59.190> shot<00:03:59.400> on<00:03:59.490> the<00:03:59.580> front

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
with any other angle shot on the front

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.630 
with any other angle shot on the front
or<00:03:59.940> side<00:04:00.440> just<00:04:01.440> a<00:04:01.560> quick<00:04:01.770> note<00:04:01.950> apparently<00:04:02.310> you

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
or side just a quick note apparently you

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.640 
or side just a quick note apparently you
hear<00:04:02.880> a<00:04:02.910> unique<00:04:03.330> explosion<00:04:04.050> when<00:04:04.230> you<00:04:04.350> kill<00:04:04.620> a

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
hear a unique explosion when you kill a

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.220 
hear a unique explosion when you kill a
tank<00:04:05.010> with<00:04:05.280> a<00:04:05.520> c4<00:04:06.120> crossbow<00:04:06.570> so<00:04:06.810> that's<00:04:07.020> pretty

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
tank with a c4 crossbow so that's pretty

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.430 
tank with a c4 crossbow so that's pretty
interesting<00:04:08.090> when<00:04:09.090> you're<00:04:09.210> aiming<00:04:09.510> at<00:04:09.660> a<00:04:09.690> jeep

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
interesting when you're aiming at a jeep

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.110 
interesting when you're aiming at a jeep
for<00:04:10.680> example<00:04:11.100> you<00:04:11.130> will<00:04:11.370> get<00:04:11.490> forty-one

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
for example you will get forty-one

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.090 
for example you will get forty-one
percent<00:04:12.300> damage<00:04:12.690> plus<00:04:13.230> a<00:04:13.440> twenty-five

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
percent damage plus a twenty-five

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.460 
percent damage plus a twenty-five
percent<00:04:14.280> damage<00:04:14.610> to<00:04:14.880> anybody<00:04:15.270> who<00:04:15.630> is<00:04:15.750> riding

percent damage to anybody who is riding

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.830 
percent damage to anybody who is riding
in<00:04:16.890> the<00:04:17.070> Jeep<00:04:17.250> at<00:04:17.430> the<00:04:17.460> time<00:04:17.820> so<00:04:18.330> any<00:04:18.570> of<00:04:18.750> the

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
in the Jeep at the time so any of the

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.630 
in the Jeep at the time so any of the
new<00:04:18.960> vehicles<00:04:19.440> are<00:04:19.590> on<00:04:19.770> the<00:04:19.920> aftermath<00:04:20.370> maps

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
new vehicles are on the aftermath maps

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.340 
new vehicles are on the aftermath maps
