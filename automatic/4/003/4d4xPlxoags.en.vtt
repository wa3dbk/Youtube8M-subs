tools<00:01:11.909> at<00:01:12.180> our<00:01:12.240> disposal<00:01:12.299> such<00:01:13.229> as<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.409> brush

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
tools at our disposal such as a brush

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.760 
tools at our disposal such as a brush
and<00:01:14.549> we<00:01:14.670> can<00:01:14.820> increase<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.450> brush<00:01:15.780> size<00:01:15.840> and

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
and we can increase the brush size and

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.640 
and we can increase the brush size and
the<00:01:17.189> brush<00:01:17.490> size<00:01:17.759> is<00:01:18.090> basically<00:01:18.630> your<00:01:18.960> swipe

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
the brush size is basically your swipe

and what happens is the two photos are

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.830 
and what happens is the two photos are
mashed<00:01:22.860> up<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:24.119> you're<00:01:24.270> not<00:01:24.390> getting<00:01:24.600> them

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840
