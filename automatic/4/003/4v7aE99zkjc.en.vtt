walk through what cables you need to use

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.660 
walk through what cables you need to use
it<00:00:24.119> what<00:00:24.660> each<00:00:24.840> of<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.109> dials<00:00:25.470> on<00:00:25.650> it<00:00:25.680> do<00:00:26.010> what

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
it what each of the dials on it do what

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.480 
it what each of the dials on it do what
to<00:00:26.789> set<00:00:27.060> them<00:00:27.240> all<00:00:27.359> to<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.869> any<00:00:28.800> pros<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.310> cons

I've<00:00:29.820> seen<00:00:30.240> while<00:00:30.510> using<00:00:30.720> this<00:00:31.019> let's<00:00:31.859> start

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
I've seen while using this let's start

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.370 
I've seen while using this let's start
on<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.279> back<00:00:32.430> first<00:00:33.120> you<00:00:33.480> have<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.719> AC<00:00:33.899> power

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
on the back first you have the AC power

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.040 
on the back first you have the AC power
plug<00:00:34.680> but<00:00:35.010> no<00:00:35.250> on/off<00:00:35.820> switch<00:00:36.090> so<00:00:36.719> if<00:00:36.780> you<00:00:36.840> plug

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
plug but no on/off switch so if you plug

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.750 
plug but no on/off switch so if you plug
this<00:00:37.200> in<00:00:37.469> it's<00:00:38.070> always<00:00:38.370> on

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
this in it's always on

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.330 
this in it's always on
then<00:00:39.329> there<00:00:39.690> are<00:00:39.719> three<00:00:40.170> input<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.710> output

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
then there are three input and output

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.750 
then there are three input and output
options<00:00:41.520> I<00:00:42.050> use<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.320> regular<00:00:43.500> XLR<00:00:44.129> cable<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.640> go

but<00:01:11.850> remember<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.659> only<00:01:12.720> have<00:01:12.840> one<00:01:13.170> output<00:01:13.560> on

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
but remember you only have one output on

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.219 
but remember you only have one output on
this<00:01:14.369> device<00:01:14.700> on<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.600> front<00:01:15.810> you'll<00:01:16.049> want<00:01:16.170> to

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
move from left to right as you set this

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.670 
move from left to right as you set this
up<00:01:17.909> so<00:01:18.240> let's<00:01:18.270> start<00:01:18.659> with<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.900> mic<00:01:19.110> preamp

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
the negative 10 level you don't really

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.620 
the negative 10 level you don't really
want<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.460> hit<00:01:32.610> zero<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:33.090> you<00:01:33.150> definitely

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
want to hit zero and you definitely

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.630 
want to hit zero and you definitely
don't<00:01:33.840> want<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.110> hit<00:01:34.350> clip<00:01:34.680> for<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.460> shure

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
don't want to hit clip for the shure

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.149 
don't want to hit clip for the shure
sm7b<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:36.689> have<00:01:36.900> my<00:01:37.049> gain<00:01:37.259> set<00:01:37.590> up<00:01:37.710> pretty<00:01:38.009> much

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
sm7b I have my gain set up pretty much

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.850 
sm7b I have my gain set up pretty much
all<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.430> way<00:01:38.720> for<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.810> 48<00:01:40.140> volt<00:01:40.320> power<00:01:40.500> button

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
all the way for the 48 volt power button

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.620 
all the way for the 48 volt power button
if<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.490> don't<00:01:41.640> see<00:01:41.759> any<00:01:41.939> levels<00:01:42.390> it's

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
if you don't see any levels it's

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.149 
if you don't see any levels it's
probably<00:01:43.290> because<00:01:43.619> you're<00:01:43.799> using<00:01:43.979> a

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
probably because you're using a

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.999 
probably because you're using a
condenser<00:01:44.460> mic<00:01:44.850> that<00:01:45.149> needs<00:01:45.360> phantom<00:01:45.780> power

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
condenser mic that needs phantom power

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:48.740 
condenser mic that needs phantom power
so<00:01:47.009> be<00:01:47.130> sure<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.280> turn<00:01:47.670> this<00:01:47.820> on<00:01:48.000> for<00:01:48.210> my

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
so be sure to turn this on for my

you're using the exact same equipment in
a<00:05:32.730> similar<00:05:33.090> environment<00:05:33.660> as<00:05:34.080> me<00:05:34.200> your

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
a similar environment as me your

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:35.810 
a similar environment as me your
settings<00:05:35.040> are<00:05:35.130> going<00:05:35.220> to<00:05:35.340> need<00:05:35.520> to<00:05:35.670> be<00:05:35.790> a

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:35.820 
settings are going to need to be a

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.310 
settings are going to need to be a
little<00:05:36.180> different<00:05:36.450> so<00:05:36.660> I<00:05:36.780> want<00:05:36.990> to<00:05:37.050> teach<00:05:37.260> you

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320 
little different so I want to teach you

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.090 
little different so I want to teach you
what<00:05:37.770> each<00:05:38.220> of<00:05:38.400> these<00:05:38.520> knobs<00:05:38.790> and<00:05:39.120> buttons<00:05:39.180> do

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:40.100 
what each of these knobs and buttons do

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:42.380 
what each of these knobs and buttons do
now<00:05:41.100> you<00:05:41.160> can<00:05:41.460> tweak<00:05:41.730> the<00:05:41.760> device<00:05:42.120> a<00:05:42.150> little

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:42.390 
now you can tweak the device a little

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.750 
now you can tweak the device a little
bit<00:05:42.600> to<00:05:42.870> your<00:05:43.110> own<00:05:43.230> needs<00:05:43.440> to<00:05:44.310> wrap<00:05:44.460> up<00:05:44.610> I'm

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:44.760 
bit to your own needs to wrap up I'm

bit to your own needs to wrap up I'm
happy<00:05:45.090> with<00:05:45.270> the<00:05:45.360> results<00:05:45.750> on<00:05:45.840> getting<00:05:46.170> from

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:46.200 
happy with the results on getting from

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.350 
happy with the results on getting from
this<00:05:46.500> to<00:05:46.770> boost<00:05:47.460> the<00:05:47.610> gain<00:05:47.730> on<00:05:47.880> microphone

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 
this to boost the gain on microphone

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.600 
this to boost the gain on microphone
plus<00:05:48.750> add<00:05:48.990> a<00:05:49.050> simple<00:05:49.530> compressor<00:05:49.920> or<00:05:50.160> gate<00:05:50.400> and

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:50.610 
plus add a simple compressor or gate and

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:52.970 
plus add a simple compressor or gate and

de-esser it would be great if you could

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:55.010 
de-esser it would be great if you could
run<00:05:53.130> multiple<00:05:53.340> mics<00:05:53.790> in<00:05:54.030> and<00:05:54.330> out<00:05:54.420> using<00:05:54.750> the
