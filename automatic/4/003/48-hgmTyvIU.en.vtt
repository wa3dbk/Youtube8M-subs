mine in as soon as you can just in case

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.900 
mine in as soon as you can just in case
it<00:00:52.079> is<00:00:52.170> first<00:00:52.469> in<00:00:52.649> spur<00:00:52.860> so<00:00:53.129> now<00:00:53.489> they<00:00:53.610> say<00:00:53.760> the

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
it is first in spur so now they say the

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.549 
it is first in spur so now they say the
beta<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.270> available<00:00:54.300> worldwide<00:00:54.930> but<00:00:55.440> the

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
beta is available worldwide but the

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.560 
beta is available worldwide but the
gameplay<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.219> visuals<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:56.850> audio<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.480> all

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
gameplay and visuals and audio and all

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.590 
gameplay and visuals and audio and all
that<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:58.050> all<00:00:58.670> english-speaking<00:00:59.670> so<00:01:00.420> if

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
that is all english-speaking so if

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.910 
that is all english-speaking so if
you're<00:01:00.809> in<00:01:00.870> a<00:01:00.930> different<00:01:01.230> country<00:01:01.379> don't

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
you're in a different country don't

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.160 
you're in a different country don't
speak<00:01:02.100> English<00:01:02.550> then<00:01:02.850> I<00:01:03.210> guess<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:03.840> can<00:01:03.960> still

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
speak English then I guess you can still

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.420 
speak English then I guess you can still
play<00:01:04.320> it<00:01:04.470> but<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:04.920> probably<00:01:05.159> won't

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
play it but you probably won't

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.740 
play it but you probably won't
understand<00:01:05.880> what's<00:01:06.000> going<00:01:06.060> on<00:01:06.299> unless<00:01:06.600> you

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
understand what's going on unless you

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.719 
understand what's going on unless you
can<00:01:06.840> speak<00:01:07.110> two<00:01:07.260> languages<00:01:07.590> then<00:01:07.979> you're<00:01:08.610> all

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
can speak two languages then you're all

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.450 
can speak two languages then you're all
