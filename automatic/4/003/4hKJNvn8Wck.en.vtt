00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:07.720
 7 a special initiative rounded five boats ajax an attempt at least years more 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.049
 then successful chance of attempting to call for help guinness book of records 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:14.519
 pick up with a special newspaper jan the servants say more about it 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.079
 well then we can tell the following about we have had one of the summer 

00:00:18.079 --> 00:00:23.480
 and fellow board member of us who sat on a terrace in Paris and I, however 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.989
 our eyes open 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:29.469
 and soft in the size of the sports newspaper and improve the wild pats 

00:00:29.469 --> 00:00:32.120
 with the five dead and that's how the idea was born 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.290
 two weeks ago we started two weeks ago 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.580
 in a spurt audio 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:38.900
 k 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.510
 Unfortunately 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.510
 petter 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.480
 first of all i think we ran a while ago 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.600
 a 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.480
 apparently well so the idea has come to vary it from a sequel to 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.130
 give to our first edition 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.170
 with the opening of the stadium we as the facts also become the newspaper 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.980
 released 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.530
 in the case was a nice continuation 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.930
 how large is that newspaper exactly 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.500
 monique to the busy questions 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.700
 8 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.700
 it is 58 centimeters wide and 4 to 8 centimeters high 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.800
 and then the logo of once hit briefly on the anticipation then you must 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.430
 for paying included that is a substantial amount and had reda c there 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.430
 we no longer have enough money from advertising revenues 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.840
 and then one has 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.200
 yes the supporter am very warm heart 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.810
 but also one you must keep 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.960
 at feyenoord there is a considerable amount available for this 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:38.850
 asked 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.820
 we have been rewarded by this work in the dome church once and insult 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.490
 they are names 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.790
 to sponsor and that is more a session 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.610
 very important then you make an effort to get into that book when you know 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.590
 not whether you will also be included in the books this record attempt 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.770
 we only know that after about 2 months 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.400
 We do have a promise that we will be far short of admiration 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.870
 this has also been the consultation between field knowledge book of records 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.860
 and the publishing and auctioning itself 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.200
 and there is a plan of approach and children will be correct by the now 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.490
 by submitting eighteen pages and the liempdse report and that 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:18.479
 awarded 

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:20.169
 the attempt 

00:02:20.169 --> 00:02:22.149
 what story is in the newspaper 

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:26.059
 several times they are all a fact that ajax does not leave the ajax feyenoord 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.360
 and of course we also have our pride and a special place 

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:31.769
 give within this 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.229
 great newspaper 

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:37.279
 how are you going to print with 1000 10,000 copies go hand it out for free fouga it 

00:02:37.279 --> 00:02:37.699
 ad 

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:41.120
 it the costs are one euro each 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.639
 but that 

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:45.859
 for the attempt with the one 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:47.300
 the purchase value 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.900
 well that 30 it would mean that we have 10,000 copies 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:57.430
 a print run of 40,000 euros means that it will be donated and 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.919
 so we can distribute it for free to the supporters 

00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:05.829
 you keep it tce but also to the management of feyenoord and others to the 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:08.839
 eu to the sponsorship of the business club that will happen around the 

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:12.209
 training the last training for ajax and around the competitions yes there are two 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.389
 From goal moments the first moment is of course to be the facts 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:19.569
 that our members receive a third child with the first I declare 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:22.619
 the very first copy is going to be a very nice thing 

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:25.829
 in this case it can also reveal that it is the archivist 

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:30.179
 someone who will give you more of the pavements in the week of the pavement with soul and salvation 

00:03:30.179 --> 00:03:33.569
 those with soul and bliss he disrupted the door of the club 

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:38.689
 guarded in a dusty room as it always becomes nice word and there 

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:43.079
 We are very proud of giving them it as the Feyenoorden and the first copy it 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:44.359
 give 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:45.719
 then we have another surprise 

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:49.480
 but he keeps it under the cap for a while, but what a nice thing about it is that 

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:53.400
 after all, being involved is a nice thing to have such an anniversary newspaper too 

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:56.189
 make it to a match that your club wins there Sunday 

00:03:56.189 --> 00:04:00.059
 that is not the most important thing in this case because our passion is 

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:02.129
 van eerd 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:03.639
 the legion 

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:07.089
 and if we have to cast a tom to victory 

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:10.319
 then it is impossible because we always have inside outside pole 

00:04:11.029 --> 00:04:14.289
 and in the feithing of feyenoord ajax then you never know how that rolls
