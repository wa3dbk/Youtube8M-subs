00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:23.450
 what is very good others 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:26.240
 this was the last test we had 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.100
 to start the tournament and so we're going to 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.950
 drink 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.050
 I think the team is pretty good 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.000
 and perhaps 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.790
 a little bit in some movements that do 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.530
 they will wake up on the offensive but the team 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.540
 I already see it very well compared tomÃ¡s 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.990
 I speak quite well quite grown up and 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.630
 that 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:49.470
 gives us confidence to face the 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.840
 party of course we expect a good 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.490
 operate a good operation that is 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.670
 what interests you the most at this moment 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.259
 beyond that the results always 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.869
 they give you much greater confidence to follow 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.929
 working and is what this team has 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.369
 fact we have the last game left and with 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:07.500
 the same seriousness with the same 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.039
 intensity that we have been training so 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.039
 let's take
