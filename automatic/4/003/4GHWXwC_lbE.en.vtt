Johnson<00:00:01.450> seahorse<00:00:02.169> 10<00:00:02.500> horsepower<00:00:03.070> that<00:00:03.460> I've

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:03.580 
Johnson seahorse 10 horsepower that I've

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:09.600 
Johnson seahorse 10 horsepower that I've
acquired<00:00:03.850> lately<00:00:07.170> there's<00:00:08.170> the<00:00:08.410> engine<00:00:08.769> it

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:09.610 
acquired lately there's the engine it

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.279 
acquired lately there's the engine it
had<00:00:09.759> really<00:00:10.059> really<00:00:10.360> weak<00:00:10.509> spark<00:00:10.959> so<00:00:11.200> I<00:00:11.230> took

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:11.289 
had really really weak spark so I took

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:14.310 
had really really weak spark so I took
the<00:00:11.559> flywheel<00:00:12.070> off<00:00:12.249> and<00:00:12.839> I'll<00:00:13.839> show<00:00:14.049> you<00:00:14.110> the

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:14.320 
the flywheel off and I'll show you the

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.090 
the flywheel off and I'll show you the
coils<00:00:14.650> here<00:00:14.829> how<00:00:14.980> badly<00:00:15.249> they<00:00:15.610> are<00:00:16.920> this<00:00:17.920> is

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:18.100 
coils here how badly they are this is

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.130 
coils here how badly they are this is
pretty<00:00:18.280> common<00:00:18.520> in<00:00:18.850> johnson<00:00:19.360> outboard<00:00:19.480> motors

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.140 
pretty common in johnson outboard motors

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.650 
pretty common in johnson outboard motors
especially<00:00:20.680> the<00:00:20.830> vintage<00:00:21.160> ones<00:00:21.400> as<00:00:22.360> you<00:00:22.450> can

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:22.660 
especially the vintage ones as you can

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.130 
especially the vintage ones as you can
see<00:00:22.870> the<00:00:22.990> coils

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
see the coils

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.400 
see the coils
i've<00:00:26.140> seen<00:00:26.470> this<00:00:26.650> so<00:00:26.890> many<00:00:26.950> times<00:00:27.220> before<00:00:27.760> so

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
i've seen this so many times before so

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.369 
i've seen this so many times before so
i'll<00:00:29.410> replace<00:00:29.800> the<00:00:29.980> coils<00:00:30.869> reset<00:00:31.869> the<00:00:31.990> points

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:32.379 
i'll replace the coils reset the points

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:36.149 
i'll replace the coils reset the points
at<00:00:32.529> 20<00:00:33.010> and<00:00:34.260> i'll<00:00:35.260> make<00:00:35.409> another<00:00:35.469> video<00:00:35.920> to

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:36.159 
at 20 and i'll make another video to

00:00:36.159 --> 00:00:37.250 
at 20 and i'll make another video to
show<00:00:36.370> you<00:00:36.399> how<00:00:36.550> it<00:00:36.699> runs

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
show you how it runs

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:44.700 
show you how it runs
still<00:00:38.260> gotta<00:00:38.440> clean<00:00:38.769> the<00:00:38.920> carburetor<00:00:39.159> on<00:00:39.489> it

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:52.770 

I<00:00:50.430> don't<00:00:51.430> think<00:00:51.640> the<00:00:51.699> cards<00:00:52.030> been<00:00:52.210> cleaned<00:00:52.600> for

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
I don't think the cards been cleaned for

00:00:52.780 --> 00:01:06.240 
I don't think the cards been cleaned for
many<00:00:53.019> many<00:00:53.260> years

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.150 

I<00:01:06.340> put<00:01:07.090> some<00:01:07.270> new<00:01:07.390> coils<00:01:07.780> on<00:01:07.960> the<00:01:07.990> motor<00:01:08.290> there

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:09.160 
I put some new coils on the motor there

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.490 
I put some new coils on the motor there
believe<00:01:10.000> they're<00:01:10.240> made<00:01:10.390> from<00:01:10.600> ceará<00:01:11.170> they're

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
believe they're made from ceará they're

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.710 
believe they're made from ceará they're
actually<00:01:11.830> made<00:01:12.040> in<00:01:12.190> Germany<00:01:15.240> I've<00:01:16.240> said<00:01:16.570> the

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
actually made in Germany I've said the

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.770 
actually made in Germany I've said the
points<00:01:17.050> that<00:01:17.140> when<00:01:17.380> you<00:01:17.470> foul

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
points that when you foul

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.719 
points that when you foul
so<00:01:19.780> they're<00:01:19.990> pretty<00:01:20.170> good<00:01:20.550> everything<00:01:21.550> looks

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
so they're pretty good everything looks

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:23.460 
so they're pretty good everything looks
good<00:01:21.940> so<00:01:22.240> we'll<00:01:22.420> put<00:01:22.630> the<00:01:22.720> flywheel<00:01:23.110> on<00:01:23.229> and

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
good so we'll put the flywheel on and

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:29.940 
good so we'll put the flywheel on and
see<00:01:23.650> what<00:01:23.770> happens<00:01:28.560> anyways<00:01:29.560> I'm<00:01:29.740> going<00:01:29.830> to

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
see what happens anyways I'm going to

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.530 
see what happens anyways I'm going to
put<00:01:30.130> back<00:01:30.280> the<00:01:30.490> flywheel<00:01:30.970> on<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:34.180> make<00:01:34.360> sure

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 
put back the flywheel on and make sure

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.310 
put back the flywheel on and make sure
the<00:01:34.720> keyway<00:01:35.140> there<00:01:35.320> lines<00:01:35.590> up

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:45.520 

Oh<00:01:42.909> already<00:01:43.909> here<00:01:44.330> the<00:01:44.479> spark<00:01:44.930> on<00:01:45.110> the<00:01:45.229> spark

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
Oh already here the spark on the spark

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:53.230 
Oh already here the spark on the spark
plugs<00:01:46.690> just<00:01:47.690> by<00:01:47.870> spinning<00:01:48.140> it

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:00.740 

so<00:01:53.720> that's<00:01:53.990> a<00:01:54.729> 3/4<00:01:55.729> inch<00:01:55.909> socket<00:01:58.150> there

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
so that's a 3/4 inch socket there

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.450 
so that's a 3/4 inch socket there
so<00:02:01.350> I'm<00:02:01.410> just<00:02:01.530> going<00:02:01.650> to<00:02:01.740> tighten<00:02:01.980> it<00:02:02.220> by<00:02:02.430> hand

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
so I'm just going to tighten it by hand

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:21.120 
so I'm just going to tighten it by hand
like<00:02:02.940> this<00:02:03.860> as<00:02:04.860> much<00:02:05.190> as<00:02:05.340> I<00:02:05.460> can<00:02:05.520> not<00:02:05.940> too<00:02:06.210> much

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.810 

their<00:02:21.760> house<00:02:22.000> should<00:02:22.240> do<00:02:23.460> now<00:02:24.460> we'll<00:02:24.610> check

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
their house should do now we'll check

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:30.340 
their house should do now we'll check
for<00:02:25.060> this<00:02:25.150> part

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.200 

I'll<00:02:31.350> just<00:02:31.590> spin<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:31.980> flywheel<00:02:32.490> by<00:02:32.700> hand<00:02:32.970> and

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
I'll just spin the flywheel by hand and

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.200 
I'll just spin the flywheel by hand and
see<00:02:33.480> what<00:02:33.630> happens<00:02:34.050> here

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
see what happens here

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:40.250 
see what happens here
there's<00:02:36.210> spark<00:02:36.810> on<00:02:37.020> this<00:02:37.230> one<00:02:37.500> and<00:02:39.260> there's

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
there's spark on this one and there's

00:02:40.260 --> 00:03:13.630 
there's spark on this one and there's
the<00:02:40.410> other<00:02:40.590> plug

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:43.129 

are<00:03:14.640> with<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:16.049> pull<00:03:16.260> cord<00:03:16.560> on<00:03:41.750> I'm<00:03:42.750> just<00:03:42.930> going

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:46.369 
are with the pull cord on I'm just going
to<00:03:43.230> spray<00:03:43.560> a<00:03:43.590> bit<00:03:43.829> of<00:03:44.480> quicker<00:03:45.480> state1<00:03:46.109> lube

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:46.379 
to spray a bit of quicker state1 lube

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:49.629 
to spray a bit of quicker state1 lube
it's<00:03:46.650> penetrating<00:03:47.310> oil<00:03:47.430> it's<00:03:48.239> very<00:03:48.450> flammable

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:49.639
