00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
important thing I kept thinking it was

time<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.850> phenomenon<00:01:18.450> football<00:01:19.340> mostly

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
time the phenomenon football mostly

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.010 
time the phenomenon football mostly
soccer<00:01:20.760> but<00:01:21.600> perhaps<00:01:22.140> football<00:01:22.740> in<00:01:22.890> general<00:01:23.100> I

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
soccer but perhaps football in general I

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.990 
soccer but perhaps football in general I
was<00:01:25.020> dealt<00:01:25.200> with<00:01:25.440> on<00:01:25.560> this<00:01:25.740> world<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.790> then<00:01:26.910> I

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
was dealt with on this world and then I

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.660 
was dealt with on this world and then I
realized<00:01:27.390> you<00:01:27.690> can't<00:01:28.050> just<00:01:28.650> do<00:01:29.040> it<00:01:29.190> like<00:01:29.430> that

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
realized you can't just do it like that

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.730 
realized you can't just do it like that
that's<00:01:30.180> like<00:01:30.390> saying<00:01:30.660> I'm<00:01:31.140> going<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.560> light

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740

one about pilots that is fairly

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.580 
one about pilots that is fairly
meaningless<00:01:35.670> you<00:01:36.660> have<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.990> find<00:01:37.200> something

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
meaningless you have to find something

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.640 
meaningless you have to find something
to<00:01:37.950> light<00:01:38.190> about<00:01:38.460> pirates<00:01:39.270> which<00:01:40.020> isn't<00:01:40.410> a

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
to light about pirates which isn't a

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.510 
to light about pirates which isn't a
melange<00:01:41.430> of<00:01:41.700> all<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.330> other<00:01:42.450> pilots<00:01:43.520> programs

movies<00:01:44.970> that<00:01:45.090> have<00:01:45.210> been<00:01:45.360> done<00:01:45.570> but<00:01:46.200> says

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
movies that have been done but says

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.820 
movies that have been done but says
something<00:01:46.800> new<00:01:46.980> about<00:01:47.240> pilots<00:01:48.240> if<00:01:48.510> that<00:01:49.260> is<00:01:49.530> at

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830

something new about pilots if that is at
this<00:01:49.980> point<00:01:50.250> actually<00:01:50.640> possible<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:52.260> then<00:01:52.620> I

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
this point actually possible and then I

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.060 
this point actually possible and then I
realized<00:01:53.540> there<00:01:54.540> was<00:01:54.690> a<00:01:54.720> very<00:01:55.110> good<00:01:55.380> way<00:01:55.620> of

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
realized there was a very good way of

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.790 
realized there was a very good way of

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
great idea you know two tribes alike no

great idea you know two tribes alike no
two<00:02:22.370> supporters<00:02:23.180> clubs<00:02:23.480> are<00:02:23.720> liking<00:02:24.140> villainy

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
two supporters clubs are liking villainy

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.920 
two supporters clubs are liking villainy
because<00:02:25.730> English<00:02:26.150> soccer<00:02:26.390> fans<00:02:26.510> were

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
because English soccer fans were

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.930 
because English soccer fans were
traditionally<00:02:27.620> renowned<00:02:28.040> phul<00:02:28.400> for<00:02:28.640> her<00:02:28.790> you

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
traditionally renowned phul for her you

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.240 
traditionally renowned phul for her you
know<00:02:29.000> they're<00:02:29.540> far<00:02:29.810> more<00:02:29.920> interesting<00:02:30.920> fights

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
know they're far more interesting fights

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.070 
know they're far more interesting fights

that<00:02:35.570> is<00:02:35.810> really<00:02:36.260> too<00:02:36.440> simple<00:02:36.920> because<00:02:37.160> that

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 
that is really too simple because that

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.400 
that is really too simple because that
really<00:02:37.730> is<00:02:37.880> low-hanging<00:02:38.210> fruit<00:02:38.930> that<00:02:39.170> that's

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
really is low-hanging fruit that that's

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:40.960 
really is low-hanging fruit that that's
a<00:02:39.530> bit<00:02:39.680> of<00:02:39.770> intelligent<00:02:40.340> cutting<00:02:40.670> and<00:02:40.820> pasting

a bit of intelligent cutting and pasting

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.150 
a bit of intelligent cutting and pasting
of<00:02:41.360> ideas<00:02:43.630> adding<00:02:44.630> a<00:02:44.810> bit<00:02:44.960> of<00:02:45.020> realism<00:02:45.710> because

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
small hand mirror that kind of stuff you

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.100 
small hand mirror that kind of stuff you
know<00:03:00.520> Romeo<00:03:01.520> and<00:03:01.700> Juliet<00:03:02.000> so<00:03:02.150> it<00:03:02.690> could<00:03:02.930> it

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
know Romeo and Juliet so it could it

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.110 
know Romeo and Juliet so it could it
could<00:03:03.140> have<00:03:03.380> been<00:03:03.470> a<00:03:03.530> comedy<00:03:03.980> if<00:03:04.160> only<00:03:04.790> someone

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
could have been a comedy if only someone

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.270 
could have been a comedy if only someone
to<00:03:05.330> do<00:03:05.510> a<00:03:05.720> bit<00:03:05.989> of<00:03:06.020> elementary<00:03:06.680> first<00:03:06.980> aid<00:03:07.250> I

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
to do a bit of elementary first aid I

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.320 
to do a bit of elementary first aid I
mean<00:03:07.550> what<00:03:07.700> was<00:03:07.820> going<00:03:08.150> on<00:03:09.250> it's<00:03:10.250> she<00:03:11.060> pleased

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
mean what was going on it's she pleased

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.540

to be dead ah and kill myself I mean
really<00:03:14.080> now<00:03:15.080> all<00:03:15.440> this<00:03:15.709> sounds<00:03:15.920> like<00:03:16.130> total

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
really now all this sounds like total

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:21.340 
really now all this sounds like total
nonsense<00:03:17.030> but<00:03:19.420> it<00:03:20.420> means<00:03:20.630> i<00:03:20.900> can<00:03:21.110> write<00:03:21.320> a

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
nonsense but it means i can write a

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.610 
nonsense but it means i can write a
novel<00:03:21.770> of<00:03:22.040> sufficient<00:03:23.140> complexity<00:03:24.140> and<00:03:24.470> with

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
novel of sufficient complexity and with

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.120 
novel of sufficient complexity and with
a<00:03:24.650> depth<00:03:25.220> of<00:03:25.489> character<00:03:25.760> so<00:03:26.530> that<00:03:27.530> it<00:03:27.830> isn't

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
a depth of character so that it isn't

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:34.620 
a depth of character so that it isn't
just<00:03:28.370> a<00:03:28.580> hey<00:03:29.120> i'm<00:03:29.810> having<00:03:30.380> a<00:03:30.470> big<00:03:30.739> joke<00:03:31.510> with

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.739
