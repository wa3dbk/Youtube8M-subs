the<00:00:35.670> hand<00:00:35.760> all<00:00:36.180> while<00:00:36.420> not<00:00:36.660> adding<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.290> ton<00:00:37.559> of

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
the hand all while not adding a ton of

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.590 
the hand all while not adding a ton of
bulk<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:38.010> your<00:00:38.160> phone<00:00:38.280> I<00:00:38.730> really<00:00:39.149> like<00:00:39.360> the

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
bulk to your phone I really like the

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.720 
bulk to your phone I really like the
minimalistic<00:00:40.320> approach<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:41.129> Ferriss<00:00:41.579> has

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
minimalistic approach that Ferriss has

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.610 
minimalistic approach that Ferriss has
taken<00:00:42.090> with<00:00:42.210> this<00:00:42.329> case<00:00:42.629> for<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.050> galaxy<00:00:43.469> s6

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
taken with this case for the galaxy s6

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.740 
taken with this case for the galaxy s6
taking<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.670> look<00:00:44.820> around<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.149> case<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:45.570> see

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
taking a look around the case you see

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.080 
taking a look around the case you see
the<00:00:45.960> power<00:00:46.140> button<00:00:46.559> which<00:00:46.680> almost<00:00:47.219> lies<00:00:47.550> flush

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
the power button which almost lies flush

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.819 
the power button which almost lies flush
and<00:00:48.450> has<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.660> mushy<00:00:49.020> feel<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.559> it<00:00:49.680> that's

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
and has a mushy feel to it that's

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.229 
and has a mushy feel to it that's
probably<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.399> only<00:00:50.610> thing<00:00:50.760> that<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:51.120> don't

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
probably the only thing that I don't

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.630 
probably the only thing that I don't
like<00:00:51.660> about<00:00:51.840> this<00:00:52.079> case<00:00:52.320> is<00:00:52.590> that<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.160> power

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
like about this case is that the power

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.970 
like about this case is that the power
button<00:00:54.030> does<00:00:54.149> not<00:00:54.360> have<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.690> really<00:00:55.289> responsive

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
button does not have a really responsive

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.920 
button does not have a really responsive
feedback<00:00:56.340> moving<00:00:56.850> along<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.449> top<00:00:57.660> you

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
feedback moving along to the top you

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.240 
feedback moving along to the top you
still<00:00:58.260> have<00:00:58.410> your<00:00:58.559> cutouts<00:00:58.859> for<00:00:59.100> your

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
still have your cutouts for your

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.279 
still have your cutouts for your
microphone<00:00:59.670> and<00:00:59.730> your<00:01:00.059> IR<00:01:00.449> blaster<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:00.989> they

microphone and your IR blaster and they
line<00:01:01.530> up<00:01:01.710> perfectly<00:01:01.739> on<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.730> opposite<00:01:03.210> end

line up perfectly on the opposite end

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.270 
line up perfectly on the opposite end
you<00:01:03.510> have<00:01:03.629> your<00:01:03.750> volume<00:01:03.930> up<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.500> down<00:01:04.530> very

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
you have your volume up and down very

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.820 
you have your volume up and down very
tactile<00:01:05.970> feel<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.900> response<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.500> them<00:01:07.650> and

tactile feel and response to them and

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.399 
tactile feel and response to them and
probably<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.460> most<00:01:08.640> important<00:01:09.420> edge<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.990> your

issues<00:01:53.340> that<00:01:53.369> I<00:01:53.549> have<00:01:53.790> with<00:01:53.939> this<00:01:54.030> case<00:01:54.090> and

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
issues that I have with this case and

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.209 
issues that I have with this case and
one<00:01:54.689> of<00:01:54.810> them<00:01:54.930> is<00:01:55.049> with<00:01:55.200> every<00:01:55.590> case<00:01:55.829> that<00:01:56.100> I've

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
one of them is with every case that I've

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.520 
one of them is with every case that I've
ever<00:01:56.369> tried<00:01:56.640> is<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.390> 3.5<00:01:58.049> millimeter

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
ever tried is the 3.5 millimeter

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.249 
ever tried is the 3.5 millimeter
headphone<00:01:58.710> jack<00:01:58.890> doesn't<00:01:59.490> allow<00:01:59.850> for<00:02:00.259> larger

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
sized inputs without having to remove

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.280 
sized inputs without having to remove
the<00:02:04.469> case<00:02:04.680> but<00:02:05.159> that<00:02:05.189> goes<00:02:05.520> for<00:02:05.549> probably<00:02:06.420> 99%

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
the case but that goes for probably 99%

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.529 
the case but that goes for probably 99%
of<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.469> cases<00:02:07.619> that<00:02:07.920> I've<00:02:08.459> used<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:09.179> second

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
of the cases that I've used the second

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.969 
of the cases that I've used the second
part<00:02:09.690> that<00:02:09.720> I<00:02:09.869> don't<00:02:09.959> like<00:02:10.259> about<00:02:10.440> this<00:02:10.709> case

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
part that I don't like about this case

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.180 
part that I don't like about this case
is<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.760> mushy<00:02:11.970> feel<00:02:12.330> of<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:12.690> power

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
is the mushy feel of the power

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.420 
is the mushy feel of the power
it<00:02:13.520> feels<00:02:13.970> like<00:02:14.240> it<00:02:14.600> needs<00:02:15.050> more<00:02:15.440> click<00:02:16.160> eNOS

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
it feels like it needs more click eNOS

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.030 
it feels like it needs more click eNOS
to<00:02:16.670> it<00:02:16.850> and<00:02:17.000> I<00:02:17.540> need<00:02:17.900> that<00:02:18.110> tactile<00:02:18.560> response

to it and I need that tactile response

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.530 
to it and I need that tactile response
