hello<00:00:02.220> everyone<00:00:02.909> welcome<00:00:03.300> to<00:00:03.600> another<00:00:03.899> one<00:00:04.140> of

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
hello everyone welcome to another one of

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.340 
hello everyone welcome to another one of
my<00:00:04.319> minecraft<00:00:04.799> videos<00:00:05.180> today<00:00:06.180> I<00:00:06.210> have<00:00:06.690> yet

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
my minecraft videos today I have yet

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.009 
my minecraft videos today I have yet
another<00:00:07.790> contraption<00:00:08.790> I<00:00:09.059> made<00:00:09.300> using<00:00:09.690> this

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
another contraption I made using this

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.919 
another contraption I made using this
time<00:00:10.349> of<00:00:10.620> iron<00:00:10.980> doors<00:00:11.900> whetstone<00:00:12.900> piston<00:00:13.830> and

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:14.929 
time of iron doors whetstone piston and

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:21.759 
time of iron doors whetstone piston and
repeaters<00:00:15.949> so<00:00:16.949> let's<00:00:17.250> enter<00:00:18.029> this<00:00:18.210> bonus<00:00:18.720> room

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:21.769 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:24.380 

alright<00:00:22.769> so<00:00:23.279> here<00:00:23.670> you're<00:00:23.789> liking<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.269> low

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
alright so here you're liking the low

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.519 
alright so here you're liking the low
hall<00:00:26.240> so<00:00:27.240> first<00:00:27.510> we<00:00:27.660> read<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.869> instruction

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
hall so first we read the instruction

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.189 
hall so first we read the instruction
when<00:00:29.490> press<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.119> button<00:00:30.390> once<00:00:30.689> then<00:00:31.019> go

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
when press the button once then go

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.380 
when press the button once then go
inside<00:00:31.349> I'm<00:00:31.890> guessing<00:00:32.489> it's<00:00:32.610> this<00:00:32.820> button<00:00:33.180> and

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
inside I'm guessing it's this button and

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.229 
inside I'm guessing it's this button and
to<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.500> levers<00:00:34.860> behind<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.340> doors<00:00:35.579> are<00:00:35.969> like

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
to the levers behind the doors are like

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.540 
to the levers behind the doors are like
checkpoints<00:00:36.930> ok<00:00:37.350> so<00:00:37.969> so<00:00:38.969> once<00:00:39.210> you<00:00:40.070> went<00:00:41.070> past

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
checkpoints ok so so once you went past

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.729 
checkpoints ok so so once you went past
this<00:00:42.239> door<00:00:42.540> they<00:00:42.719> can<00:00:42.899> just<00:00:43.110> open<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.530> lever

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
this door they can just open the lever

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.580 
this door they can just open the lever
so<00:00:43.920> you<00:00:43.980> don't<00:00:44.190> have<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.579> redo<00:00:45.210> this<00:00:45.360> door<00:00:45.660> so

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
so you don't have to redo this door so

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.049 
so you don't have to redo this door so
basically<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.280> point<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:47.550> this<00:00:47.730> it's<00:00:48.000> like

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
basically the point of this it's like

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.270 
basically the point of this it's like
some<00:00:48.360> kind<00:00:48.480> of<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.690> Speed<00:00:49.020> Challenge<00:00:49.350> I'm<00:00:50.070> going

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
some kind of a Speed Challenge I'm going

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.520 
some kind of a Speed Challenge I'm going
to<00:00:50.340> press<00:00:50.610> this<00:00:50.820> button<00:00:51.059> then<00:00:51.870> this<00:00:52.230> door<00:00:52.410> is

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
to press this button then this door is

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.130 
to press this button then this door is
going<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.770> open<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.809> there's<00:00:54.809> going<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.020> be<00:00:55.050> a

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
going to open and there's going to be a

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.689 
going to open and there's going to be a
delay<00:00:55.469> then<00:00:55.710> another<00:00:55.980> door<00:00:56.219> is<00:00:56.340> going<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.579> open

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
delay then another door is going to open

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.689 
delay then another door is going to open
out<00:00:57.149> I'll<00:00:57.329> have<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.660> react<00:00:58.020> fast<00:00:58.469> enough<00:00:58.699> so

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
out I'll have to react fast enough so

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:18.940 
out I'll have to react fast enough so
let's<00:01:00.090> give<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.809> try<00:01:08.630> I<00:01:11.659> didn't<00:01:12.659> manage<00:01:17.390> this

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
let's give it a try I didn't manage this

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.620 
let's give it a try I didn't manage this
this<00:01:20.720> open<00:01:21.720> this<00:01:22.100> alright<00:01:23.360> let's<00:01:24.360> do<00:01:24.479> this

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
this open this alright let's do this

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:35.690 
this open this alright let's do this
again<00:01:24.930> ah<00:01:31.759> presta<00:01:33.860> must<00:01:34.860> not<00:01:35.159> have<00:01:35.340> pressed

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
again ah presta must not have pressed

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:45.630 
again ah presta must not have pressed
button<00:01:36.200> properly<00:01:39.320> once<00:01:40.320> again<00:01:40.650> Oh

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:02:25.610 

ah<00:01:47.250> once<00:01:48.250> again<00:01:49.290> I<00:01:50.290> hate<00:01:50.710> those<00:01:50.890> iron<00:01:51.130> doors

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.470 

okay<00:02:26.620> so<00:02:26.680> let<00:02:27.489> me<00:02:27.519> explain<00:02:28.090> to<00:02:28.300> you<00:02:28.330> the

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
okay so let me explain to you the

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.570 
okay so let me explain to you the
principle<00:02:29.170> of<00:02:29.200> this<00:02:29.380> creation<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:32.500> point<00:02:32.769> all

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
principle of this creation the point all

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.940 
principle of this creation the point all
this<00:02:33.760> distance<00:02:34.440> is<00:02:35.440> actually<00:02:36.010> two<00:02:36.190> pictures

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
this distance is actually two pictures

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.370 
this distance is actually two pictures
it's<00:02:38.950> actually<00:02:39.400> two<00:02:39.959> to<00:02:40.959> measure<00:02:41.140> how

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
it's actually two to measure how

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.520 
it's actually two to measure how
efficient<00:02:41.890> over<00:02:42.220> in<00:02:42.459> the<00:02:42.610> door<00:02:42.820> challenge

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
efficient over in the door challenge

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.550 
efficient over in the door challenge
basically<00:02:44.530> when<00:02:44.830> you<00:02:44.860> press<00:02:45.160> the<00:02:45.340> button<00:02:45.370> I'm

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
basically when you press the button I'm

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.819 
basically when you press the button I'm
the<00:02:47.560> redstone<00:02:48.130> circuit<00:02:48.340> is<00:02:48.700> that<00:02:49.030> is<00:02:49.209> right

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
the redstone circuit is that is right

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:52.800 
the redstone circuit is that is right
here<00:02:50.829> let<00:02:51.250> me<00:02:51.459> show<00:02:51.489> you<00:02:51.700> the<00:02:52.420> redstone

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
here let me show you the redstone

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.240 
here let me show you the redstone
circuit<00:02:53.019> that<00:02:53.380> is<00:02:53.440> right<00:02:54.130> here<00:02:54.630> we'll<00:02:55.630> start

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
circuit that is right here we'll start

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.539 
circuit that is right here we'll start
looping<00:02:57.250> as<00:02:57.790> you<00:02:57.910> can<00:02:58.030> see<00:02:58.269> and<00:02:59.280> the<00:03:00.280> more<00:03:00.519> you

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
looping as you can see and the more you

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.280 
looping as you can see and the more you
press<00:03:00.910> the<00:03:01.090> button<00:03:01.120> those<00:03:01.600> so<00:03:01.840> we're<00:03:01.989> going<00:03:02.170> to

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
press the button those so we're going to

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.130 
press the button those so we're going to
fail<00:03:02.590> the<00:03:03.370> more<00:03:03.579> impulse<00:03:04.000> will<00:03:04.329> be<00:03:04.510> a<00:03:04.540> little

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
fail the more impulse will be a little

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.569 
fail the more impulse will be a little
circuit<00:03:05.880> that<00:03:06.880> means<00:03:07.180> that<00:03:07.989> the<00:03:08.530> more<00:03:09.340> times

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
circuit that means that the more times

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:11.030 
circuit that means that the more times
you<00:03:09.670> press<00:03:09.970> the<00:03:10.120> binding

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
you press the binding

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.929 
you press the binding
the<00:03:11.489> more<00:03:11.700> times<00:03:11.969> the<00:03:12.860> circuit<00:03:13.860> will<00:03:14.129> be<00:03:14.310> will

00:03:14.929 --> 00:03:14.939 
the more times the circuit will be will

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:18.319 
the more times the circuit will be will
be<00:03:14.969> active<00:03:15.510> and<00:03:15.950> so<00:03:16.950> the<00:03:17.579> the<00:03:17.909> part<00:03:18.150> with<00:03:18.299> the

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
be active and so the the part with the

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.809 
be active and so the the part with the
pistons<00:03:18.810> will<00:03:18.989> be<00:03:19.219> will<00:03:20.219> get<00:03:20.370> harder<00:03:20.549> and

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
pistons will be will get harder and

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:26.809 
pistons will be will get harder and
harder<00:03:22.010> and<00:03:24.170> eventually<00:03:25.170> if<00:03:25.349> the<00:03:25.920> impulse<00:03:26.519> is

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 
harder and eventually if the impulse is

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:28.819 
harder and eventually if the impulse is
constant<00:03:27.420> then<00:03:28.079> it<00:03:28.319> will<00:03:28.439> be<00:03:28.560> impossible

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
constant then it will be impossible

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:31.039 
constant then it will be impossible
because<00:03:29.459> the<00:03:29.849> business<00:03:30.030> will<00:03:30.420> be<00:03:30.569> blocking

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
because the business will be blocking

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:35.119 
because the business will be blocking
the<00:03:31.260> way<00:03:32.209> so<00:03:33.260> that's<00:03:34.260> it<00:03:34.500> for<00:03:34.560> this<00:03:34.859> little

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:35.129 
the way so that's it for this little

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:38.660 
the way so that's it for this little
challenge<00:03:35.939> I<00:03:36.150> hope<00:03:37.079> you<00:03:37.319> enjoyed<00:03:37.680> it<00:03:37.859> I'm

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
challenge I hope you enjoyed it I'm
