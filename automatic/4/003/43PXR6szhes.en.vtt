00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:09.730 
I work out like I'm not getting the

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:12.000 
I work out like I'm not getting the
results<00:05:09.880> I<00:05:10.270> want<00:05:10.540> I'd<00:05:10.870> rather<00:05:11.110> lose<00:05:11.710> inches

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.010 
results I want I'd rather lose inches

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:16.650 
results I want I'd rather lose inches
then<00:05:12.520> wait<00:05:13.110> like<00:05:14.110> pounds<00:05:14.800> pounds<00:05:15.430> maybe<00:05:15.880> you

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:16.660 
then wait like pounds pounds maybe you

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.980 
then wait like pounds pounds maybe you
know<00:05:16.780> I<00:05:16.990> know<00:05:17.230> that<00:05:17.620> weighs<00:05:17.860> more<00:05:18.630> no<00:05:19.630> muscle

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990 
know I know that weighs more no muscle

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.650 
know I know that weighs more no muscle
weighs<00:05:20.110> more<00:05:20.140> than<00:05:20.350> fat<00:05:20.500> so<00:05:21.130> if<00:05:21.280> I'm<00:05:21.660> 180

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.660 
weighs more than fat so if I'm 180

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:26.400 
weighs more than fat so if I'm 180
pounds<00:05:23.260> thick<00:05:24.040> muscle<00:05:24.820> it<00:05:25.600> would<00:05:26.140> look<00:05:26.230> a<00:05:26.380> lot

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:26.410 
pounds thick muscle it would look a lot

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.220 
pounds thick muscle it would look a lot
better<00:05:26.680> than<00:05:26.950> 180<00:05:27.610> pounds<00:05:27.970> of<00:05:28.090> fat<00:05:28.330> so<00:05:28.660> I'd

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:29.230 
better than 180 pounds of fat so I'd

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:32.460 
better than 180 pounds of fat so I'd
rather<00:05:29.410> be<00:05:29.710> more<00:05:29.980> muscle<00:05:30.460> but<00:05:31.210> I<00:05:31.510> mean<00:05:31.990> it's

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.470 
rather be more muscle but I mean it's

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:33.690 
rather be more muscle but I mean it's
like<00:05:32.620> whatever<00:05:32.800> I'm<00:05:33.040> doing<00:05:33.100> its<00:05:33.520> not<00:05:33.640> working
