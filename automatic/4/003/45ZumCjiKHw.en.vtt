00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.100
 Naval Academy 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.560
 Hello, Captains! 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:29.260
 And there is the second chapter of our video of World of Warships. 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.960
 Last time we showed you how to drive your ship and how to perform maneuvers properly. 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.640
 Now we'll learn some shooting tricks. 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.260
 Every ship carries an arsenal of weapons 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.560
 from heavy guns to anti-aircraft guns. 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:46.640
 For example, battleship VI. Fuso has 106 works. 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.440
 How to handle such a number? 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.280
 Usually, each ship carries three sets of weapons: 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.520
 primary armament for heavy armored ships 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.920
 such as battleships and cruisers; 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.480
 secondary equipment 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.200
 which is good against fast, non-armored targets such as destroyers; 

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.740
 and anti-aircraft guns 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.100
 which are good at shooting enemy aircraft. 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.920
 Most of the time you'll use the main armament. 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.520
 Press SHIFT or use the mouse wheel to switch to telescope view. 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.080
 Check the indicators first. 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.800
 Their numbers correspond to the number of guns or towers. 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.160
 Use a sight to target the target. 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.040
 The green color of the pointer means the guns are ready to fire. 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.600
 The light orange color means the guns are aiming at the target. 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.320
 Dark orange means that the guns cannot be aimed at the target. 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.800
 Red means that the gun is out of service. 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.780
 The same color scheme is used for the ship status panel. 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.780
 The line below the sight is the overcharging indicator. 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.220
 Use the mouse to fire. 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.980
 Press the left arrow button 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.880
 beginning with the first cannon that was overcharged and focused on the target. 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.880
 Press the left button again to shoot another cannon. 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.540
 For gradual shooting from all available guns 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.600
 press and hold the left mouse button. 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.740
 When you press the middle button or mouse wheel, 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.740
 the gun fires and the camera follows the fired grenade. 

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:14.100
 Double-click the left mouse button to fire the entire side salvo - all available cannons fire at once. 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.300
 Game includes auto targeting 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.940
 which simplifies targeting. 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.000
 The enemy will be marked with a white circle 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.560
 and the camera (not the sight!) will watch it. 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.000
 Learn how to make the most of your ship's firepower. 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.560
 Before you can fire the cannons, adjust the position of the ship as needed. 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.160
 Example: 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.880
 cruiser III. levels, St. Luis, carrying 14 works of major works. 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.280
 If St. Luis facing the enemy, 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.360
 only one of them can shoot at the enemy. 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.240
 They can shoot four cannons while lightly adjusting the course. 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.540
 If you change your course slightly more 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.760
 You can shoot a full side volley of eight cannons at the target. 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.920
 Remember to watch the ship status panel from time to time 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.220
 who will show you which guns are capable of shooting, 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.640
 and will help you to change course to make more guns capable of shooting. 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.600
 To use maximum firepower 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.980
 make the ship perpendicular to the enemy. 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.340
 Consider this 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.860
 That maneuver makes you an easy target. 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.320
 Once you've set your range and elevation, 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.240
 you can lock it with CTRL + X. 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.760
 This allows you to look around and maneuver 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.320
 or watch an approaching enemy, 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.580
 without the cannons turning around and following your turning point. 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.420
 Press X to cancel the lock. 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.500
 Your cannons remain focused in one direction 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.720
 however, you need to make a more accurate focus manually. 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.420
 You're ready to fire now. 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.500
 This feature is especially useful for fully rotating towers 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.080
 that can shoot from starboard and port side. 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.400
 Try not to be carried away 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.300
 if you shoot in the view through the telescope, you may lose track of your surroundings. 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.020
 Any time another enemy can sneak up. 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:47.760
 Sometimes, right-click 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.720
 which allows you to keep your turrets as needed, 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.860
 while you can look around. 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.720
 This will help you avoid colliding with an island or ally 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.760
 and in time to avoid approaching torpedoes. 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.460
 Naval artillery combat can be conducted over long distances. 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:04.500
 The main artillery battery battleship Yamato 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.980
 they have 14.3 miles (26.5 kilometers) in range. 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.980
 Garnet will fly this distance in 20 seconds. 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.960
 The target can easily travel from the point of impact. 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.520
 To have a chance to hit, 

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.240
 you have to move in front of the target and shoot at the place 

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.040
 where the ship will be at the moment of impact of the grenades. 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.860
 The hanging estimate is not easy. 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.140
 Try firing a so-called "aiming shot" and see where it will go. 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.240
 Adjust aiming and shoot full volley. 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.040
 The game contains two types of ammunition: 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.000
 Breakdown (AP) and Explosive (HE) Grenades. 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.360
 If your goal is well-armored cruisers or battleships, 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:43.100
 Shoot AP grenades at his hull. 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.260
 They have a high chance to break through the armor plate; 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.440
 if they do, they will explode inside the ship 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.020
 and cause serious damage. 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.820
 However, AP grenades will fly through the hull of an unarmoured destroyer, 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.300
 or by extending any ship and causing almost no damage. 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.320
 This is the case when HE grenades come in handy. 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.000
 They are capable of causing extensive damage to lightly armored ships. 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.580
 If the enemy armor is too strong for your AP grenades, 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.600
 HE grenades can ignite the enemy, 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.600
 which greatly reduces its life. 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.680
 Modules that affect a ship's combat capability are divided into two groups: 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.300
 external - placed on board - and internal. 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.820
 Outdoor modules include: main gun gear, 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:23.660
 secondary armament, anti-aircraft guns (AA cannons) and torpedo launchers. 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.900
 If you damage an enemy or destroy weapons 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.680
 he won't be able to fight. 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.900
 Internal modules include: motor and control elements. 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.760
 Destroy them and the enemy ship will lose its ability to maneuver. 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.080
 It will become an easy target. 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.700
 And finally, the easiest way to sink an enemy ship 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.700
 is to cause an explosion of its ammunition depots. 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.320
 Secondary equipment shoots automatically. 

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.380
 He's heading for the nearest ship that is heading toward you 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:53.980
 and has at least holding points. 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.480
 Or, you can set the priority target by pressing CTRL 

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.520
 and left mouse button on the enemy. 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.180
 An icon depicting priority targeting for your secondary battery appears 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:07.000
 above the marked boat. 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.960
 If the ship leaves 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.000
 Effective range of your secondary batteries 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.760
 they are instantly converted to the nearest opponent. 

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.560
 Most of your secondary batteries are important. 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:21.160
 Cannons with caliber over 6 inches (150 mm) use AP grenades, 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.980
 while smaller calibers use HE grenades. 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.540
 This becomes important to your ship's capabilities 

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:27.720
 to find optimal destinations 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.880
 and the most effective combat with them. 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.160
 AA guns also work automatically 

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.160
 concentrates fire on attacking squadrons, 

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.160
 such as torpedo planes and dive bombers. 

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.440
 The aircraft, which is the first to reach effective range, will become a priority target. 

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:47.800
 You can also manually specify a priority target for AA cannons 

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.720
 by pressing CTRL and left mouse button on it, 

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.720
 which seems most dangerous to you at the moment. 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.720
 It's no coincidence 

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:59.220
 that aircraft and ships carrying torpedoes are for AA guns 

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:00.720
 and secondary batteries are priority targets. 

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:02.880
 To see why this is the case, see the upcoming episode. 

00:07:05.086 --> 00:07:09.052
 World of Warships On the battlefield!
