00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.810
 hello very good the two of youtube 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.139
 welcome to this week's video blog 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.849
 This is my turn to put on the face I come 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.980
 to talk about one of the things that most 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.890
 is giving you something to talk about on youtube 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.480
 these last days and since it's good 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.939
 because it is neither nothing more nor nothing less than 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.100
 of big auto 5 online we already made a 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.920
 video about everything we have to 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.840
 knowing the artifact online is worth the day 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.330
 before the launch and you will say good and 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.590
 why are you coming to this? 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.390
 let's go by steps first leads now to 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.129
 active since the October number is worth 1 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.890
 October he lives in quotes and in 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.540
 capitals because it's giving so many 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.570
 many problems 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.329
 grand theft auto 5 is going to be known already 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.920
 in the story for the game I would 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.110
 millions of copies in less than one 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.590
 week 800 million the first three 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.000
 days where he was a fool and the last 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.430
 they covered the cost of production in so 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.699
 only the day of release have won 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.430
 a lot of money but they had for me 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.260
 I do not know if it has been fault problems 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.750
 I waited or if they waited because 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.120
 there were the numbers in the number of 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.460
 players who could I was going to enter the 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.050
 online on October 1 and it was that 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.240
 arrive on October 1 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.400
 where is the online spoke of 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.229
 playstationnetwork is worth the equipment 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.120
 yes it is true that they have had less 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.690
 but problems still remain 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.600
 problems 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.470
 you will say but good comes day 1 of 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.000
 October 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:36.090
 rockstar has what I know 300 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.560
 millions of copies sold and they are not going to 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.930
 enter nothing more than I look 2000 at the online 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.399
 Well, if you see there was a flood of people 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.990
 who were trying to enter online thing 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:46.770
 normal logic since they have sold so many 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:49.380
 copies that the servers were missing I 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.450
 I tried until October 23 I could not 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.520
 enter the online and if I could enter it was 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.460
 with problems the truth that has had 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.229
 many rockstar problems one thing is 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.880
 that you take online the same day as the 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.890
 game and do not expect that you owe so much 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.020
 people for anything else that since 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.480
 read in two weeks later and still not 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:10.840
 have problems everywhere fault 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.790
 the servers go and go very badly and it's a 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.030
 today that a week has passed 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.100
 long when you're still entering 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.560
 and there are still problems then for 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.360
 another part talking about playstation 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.490
 network xbox I do not know if it will happen are the 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:29.350
 load times when it's a time 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:31.240
 of load to say loading of mea if 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.340
 you want me to make verbal charge of a glass 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.560
 of milk that will give you time because 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.900
 you can easily throw away easily me 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.300
 I say up to 56 minutes 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.270
 loading or joining online match 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.770
 llosa game multiplayer games 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.990
 crew that was going to be the most 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.550
 revolutionize this of the light the screen 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.950
 it's a group of friends so to speak 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.830
 street band still we can not yet 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:56.170
 join us in a game our own I think 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.550
 that we have formed four friends not 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.740
 we can notice the slogans we have to 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.570
 join in servers that there are people the 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.810
 people play good punch are normal 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.239
 logical, you have fun 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.310
 will have played like in the whole moon because 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:11.520
 I could not in about 34 hours and the 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.800
 true that the multiplayer is a pass 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.530
 the online is super good if you do not say is 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.940
 for the problems he is having 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.280
 they are problems that for a company of 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.769
 rockstar should not be happening in 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.230
 GTA 5 was the game that everyone 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:29.420
 He spoke the wonders lend online 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:31.319
 he has despised him he has discredited 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.980
 discredited brother I have to look 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:36.510
 this has discredited a bit since already 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.580
 not all are bad words they are already 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.769
 words that servers fall 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.380
 the cloud will be missing even until 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:44.970
 a few days the characters have been deleted 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.799
 people who had invested many hours 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.720
 without many hours waiting and many 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:51.989
 problems that your character had level 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:55.230
 20 commented that according to million dollars 5 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.849
 200 thousand dollars erased from characters 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.019
 now you have to be waiting 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:03.090
 waiting for a solution to come out 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:05.910
 waiting for the rockstar people 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:07.980
 speak no more playstation network 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.110
 we remember two updates for 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.760
 the line since it came out 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.980
 the third is on the way because it continues 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.799
 having failed from the first day that 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:20.420
 I kept witch and was lost and I tell you 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:23.300
 It has been a for me 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:25.220
 a big mistake a big shit goes like this 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.710
 I did not expect this, I hope 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.420
 here is going to be an authentic past but 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.850
 you are put to play online that is 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.560
 being expected that if I'm starting 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.030
 and friends join then nothing that 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.340
 according to one gives you file we have to 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.620
 leaving us to go back into another but the 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.880
 true that with all these problems that 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.910
 It has been broken either cloud 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.620
 with servers with everything but online 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:48.050
 and the game is still an authentic 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.340
 past the law has almost seven hundred 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.640
 missions has a totally history 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:54.560
 different game I think two pass 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.350
 months before what happens in the game 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.960
 true is an authentic past is like 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:02.300
 a new game but with your friends 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.250
 new new missions appear after the 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.220
 difficulty have gone up a lot people are 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.780
 complained that the departure of the 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:11.750
 game was very easy in online the 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.550
 difficulty is higher there are careers that 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.990
 they talk about team ships is 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.360
 true that it is an authentic as well 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.980
 I said there is everything of everything still in this 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.450
 video was to see what I thought and I think 

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:23.180
 of all the other failures that it has had 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:25.640
 roster with the online they protect you 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.080
 have seemed to have been accepted a lot if you 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.300
 you have found the solution 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.590
 of characters put it in the comments 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.050
 for people who have not yet 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:37.250
 found nothing I say goodbye with this 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:39.199
 videoblog asking for your opinion for 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:41.330

 I'm playing , you know, many did 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:47.169
 others that you can and nothing I asked if 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.169
 nike and see you next video
