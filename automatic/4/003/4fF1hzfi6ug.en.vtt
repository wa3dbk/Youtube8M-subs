00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:17.330 

and<00:00:13.799> now<00:00:14.160> we<00:00:14.219> come<00:00:14.549> to<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:15.059> adversaries<00:00:16.340> these

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
and now we come to the adversaries these

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.439 
and now we come to the adversaries these
were<00:00:17.520> indeed<00:00:17.820> packaged<00:00:18.449> as<00:00:18.720> one<00:00:19.350> hit<00:00:19.949> before

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:20.449 
were indeed packaged as one hit before

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:23.300 
were indeed packaged as one hit before
yeah<00:00:21.449> one<00:00:21.840> thirty<00:00:22.109> two<00:00:22.199> hundred<00:00:22.380> one<00:00:22.980> thirty

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
yeah one thirty two hundred one thirty

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.269 
yeah one thirty two hundred one thirty
seven<00:00:23.609> hundred<00:00:23.760> and<00:00:24.300> one<00:00:25.260> twenty<00:00:25.680> two<00:00:25.710> hundred

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
seven hundred and one twenty two hundred

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.500 
seven hundred and one twenty two hundred
I<00:00:26.369> think<00:00:26.640> they're<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:26.939> different<00:00:27.269> scales

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
I think they're the different scales

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.900 
I think they're the different scales
they're<00:00:27.930> all<00:00:28.199> over<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.619> place<00:00:28.670> so<00:00:29.670> I'm<00:00:29.789> not

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
they're all over the place so I'm not

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.150 
they're all over the place so I'm not
surprised<00:00:30.390> that<00:00:30.630> round<00:00:31.080> two<00:00:31.320> decided<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.949> pull

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
surprised that round two decided to pull

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.160 
surprised that round two decided to pull
these<00:00:32.369> apart<00:00:32.430> because<00:00:33.180> this<00:00:33.420> is<00:00:33.540> much<00:00:33.899> bigger

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
these apart because this is much bigger

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.940 
these apart because this is much bigger
than<00:00:34.500> these<00:00:34.770> other<00:00:35.010> two<00:00:36.410> how<00:00:37.410> do<00:00:37.469> I<00:00:37.620> need<00:00:37.770> that

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
than these other two how do I need that

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.720 
than these other two how do I need that
let's<00:00:38.399> take<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.640> look<00:00:38.910> at<00:00:39.030> them<00:00:40.550> this<00:00:41.550> is

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
let's take a look at them this is

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.520 
let's take a look at them this is
definitely<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.210> handful<00:00:42.690> of<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:43.020> kit<00:00:43.230> this

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
definitely a handful of a kit this

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.290 
definitely a handful of a kit this
pieces<00:00:43.860> here<00:00:44.250> alone<00:00:44.489> are<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.789> really<00:00:45.149> good

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
pieces here alone are a really good

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.520 
pieces here alone are a really good
service<00:00:46.820> and<00:00:47.820> it's<00:00:48.090> devastatingly<00:00:48.899> simple<00:00:49.410> on

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
service and it's devastatingly simple on

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.790 
service and it's devastatingly simple on
the<00:00:49.680> part<00:00:49.920> count<00:00:50.190> that's<00:00:50.489> for<00:00:50.730> sure

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
the part count that's for sure

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.860 
the part count that's for sure
which<00:00:52.800> two<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.190> these<00:00:53.340> hat<00:00:53.730> haul<00:00:54.120> has<00:00:54.360> happen

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
which two of these hat haul has happen

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.200 
which two of these hat haul has happen
to<00:00:54.960> go<00:00:55.079> together<00:00:55.260> I<00:00:55.500> don't<00:00:55.920> know<00:00:56.129> offhand<00:00:56.340> but

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
to go together I don't know offhand but

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.360 
to go together I don't know offhand but
the<00:00:57.449> directions<00:00:57.989> make<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:58.559> more<00:00:58.770> than<00:00:59.010> simple

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
the directions make it more than simple

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.180 
the directions make it more than simple
and<00:00:59.520> plain<00:00:59.760> enough<00:01:00.230> they're<00:01:01.230> really<00:01:01.620> easy<00:01:01.920> to

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
and plain enough they're really easy to

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.920 
and plain enough they're really easy to
read<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.670> they<00:01:02.820> go<00:01:03.000> really<00:01:03.210> fast

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
read and they go really fast

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.880 
read and they go really fast
in<00:01:04.229> fact<00:01:05.869> there's<00:01:06.869> all<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.260> construction

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
in fact there's all the construction

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.920 
in fact there's all the construction
right<00:01:08.070> there<00:01:08.340> three<00:01:08.729> steps<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.570> engine

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
right there three steps and the engine

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.370 
right there three steps and the engine
is<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.200> most<00:01:10.229> complicated<00:01:10.799> part<00:01:12.380> and

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
is the most complicated part and

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.170 
is the most complicated part and
speaking<00:01:13.920> of<00:01:14.010> which<00:01:14.189> that<00:01:14.490> comes<00:01:14.700> with<00:01:14.939> clear

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
speaking of which that comes with clear

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.710 
speaking of which that comes with clear
drills<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:15.930> glow-in-the-dark<00:01:16.619> drills<00:01:17.630> so<00:01:18.630> if

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
drills and glow-in-the-dark drills so if

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.050 
drills and glow-in-the-dark drills so if
you've<00:01:18.900> got<00:01:19.080> some<00:01:19.439> green<00:01:19.890> LED<00:01:20.430> tape<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:20.909> can

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
you've got some green LED tape you can

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.170 
you've got some green LED tape you can
put<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.390> straight<00:01:21.600> behind<00:01:21.869> there<00:01:22.320> is<00:01:22.500> my<00:01:22.680> bet

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
put it straight behind there is my bet

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.440 
put it straight behind there is my bet
it<00:01:24.180> certainly<00:01:24.540> looks<00:01:24.930> wide<00:01:25.170> enough<00:01:25.530> sit<00:01:26.009> or<00:01:26.970> go

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
it certainly looks wide enough sit or go

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.149 
it certainly looks wide enough sit or go
with<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:27.810> being<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.350> can<00:01:28.500> have<00:01:28.650> it<00:01:28.799> glow<00:01:28.950> in

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
with you being you can have it glow in

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.190 
with you being you can have it glow in
the<00:01:29.250> dark<00:01:29.490> really<00:01:29.909> brightly<00:01:30.180> or<00:01:30.570> glow<00:01:30.960> in<00:01:31.110> the

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
the dark really brightly or glow in the

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.560 
the dark really brightly or glow in the
day<00:01:31.350> too

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
day too

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.630 
day too
the<00:01:33.570> decals<00:01:33.990> themselves<00:01:34.740> there's<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.130> lot<00:01:35.490> of

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
the decals themselves there's a lot of

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.550 
the decals themselves there's a lot of
them<00:01:35.759> there<00:01:35.970> but<00:01:36.450> they're<00:01:36.689> all<00:01:36.720> little<00:01:37.380> white

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
them there but they're all little white

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.300 
them there but they're all little white
windows<00:01:38.750> so<00:01:39.750> all<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.380> detailing<00:01:40.979> that<00:01:41.130> you're

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
windows so all the detailing that you're

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.249 
windows so all the detailing that you're
going<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.520> do<00:01:41.670> on<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.000> ship<00:01:42.060> definitely<00:01:42.960> comes

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
going to do on the ship definitely comes

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.560 
going to do on the ship definitely comes
down<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:44.100> airbrush<00:01:44.729> overall<00:01:47.420> so<00:01:48.420> all

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
down to the airbrush overall so all

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.490 
down to the airbrush overall so all
these<00:01:48.720> panel<00:01:49.200> lines<00:01:49.409> are<00:01:49.920> raised

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
these panel lines are raised

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.590 
these panel lines are raised
that's<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.460> little<00:01:53.640> too<00:01:53.850> bad<00:01:54.060> that<00:01:54.360> look

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
that's a little too bad that look

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.260 
that's a little too bad that look
gorgeous<00:01:54.990> that<00:01:55.500> was<00:01:55.650> in<00:01:55.830> set<00:01:56.130> is<00:01:56.340> my<00:01:56.520> bet<00:01:56.790> but

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
gorgeous that was in set is my bet but

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.270 
gorgeous that was in set is my bet but
if<00:01:57.360> this<00:01:57.450> get<00:01:57.690> well<00:01:58.050> maybe<00:01:58.350> twice<00:01:58.620> the<00:01:59.040> size

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
if this get well maybe twice the size

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.270 
if this get well maybe twice the size
would<00:01:59.610> be<00:01:59.670> a<00:01:59.790> little<00:02:00.150> too<00:02:00.330> large<00:02:00.570> so<00:02:01.230> at<00:02:01.380> 1600

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
would be a little too large so at 1600

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.240 
would be a little too large so at 1600
1000<00:02:03.240> will<00:02:03.390> definitely<00:02:03.810> be<00:02:03.960> massive<00:02:04.440> but<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.070> 1

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
1000 will definitely be massive but a 1

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.910 
1000 will definitely be massive but a 1
2500<00:02:06.210> scale<00:02:06.480> of<00:02:06.720> this<00:02:06.840> kit<00:02:07.080> might<00:02:07.320> not<00:02:07.350> be<00:02:07.560> too

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
2500 scale of this kit might not be too

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.850 
2500 scale of this kit might not be too
bad<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:08.160> thing<00:02:09.080> let's<00:02:10.080> take<00:02:10.290> a<00:02:10.320> look<00:02:10.590> at<00:02:10.740> the

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
bad a thing let's take a look at the

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.930 
bad a thing let's take a look at the
other<00:02:11.010> two<00:02:11.220> adversaries<00:02:13.190> and<00:02:14.190> a<00:02:14.280> very<00:02:14.580> small

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
other two adversaries and a very small

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.150 
other two adversaries and a very small
amount<00:02:15.000> of<00:02:15.420> plastic<00:02:15.630> hair<00:02:16.140> I'm<00:02:16.560> not<00:02:16.920> too

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
amount of plastic hair I'm not too

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.800 
amount of plastic hair I'm not too
surprised<00:02:17.610> they<00:02:17.850> pulled<00:02:18.150> this<00:02:18.390> apart<00:02:18.750> from

to the 1701 D Y let's Claude a PPS was

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.020 
to the 1701 D Y let's Claude a PPS was
just<00:05:36.330> to<00:05:36.480> see<00:05:37.460> opening<00:05:38.460> the<00:05:38.550> box<00:05:38.760> and

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.030 
just to see opening the box and

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:40.910 
just to see opening the box and
realizing<00:05:39.690> that<00:05:39.720> the<00:05:39.990> D<00:05:40.170> is<00:05:40.350> in<00:05:40.500> pretty<00:05:40.800> much

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:40.920 
realizing that the D is in pretty much

realizing that the D is in pretty much

invisible it's not going to be much of a

invisible it's not going to be much of a
scale<00:05:43.410> comparison<00:05:44.240> and<00:05:45.240> I<00:05:45.480> don't<00:05:45.540> really<00:05:45.870> want

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:46.200 
scale comparison and I don't really want

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.140 
scale comparison and I don't really want
to<00:05:46.260> break<00:05:46.440> these<00:05:46.650> pieces<00:05:46.980> out<00:05:47.310> too<00:05:47.970> much

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
to break these pieces out too much

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.530 
to break these pieces out too much
either<00:05:49.190> but<00:05:50.190> it's<00:05:50.520> definitely<00:05:50.790> a<00:05:51.090> pretty<00:05:51.330> good

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:51.540 
either but it's definitely a pretty good

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:54.380 
either but it's definitely a pretty good
size<00:05:52.160> I'm<00:05:53.160> torn<00:05:53.490> between<00:05:53.640> the<00:05:54.030> one<00:05:54.180> one

size I'm torn between the one one

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:57.140 
size I'm torn between the one one
thousand<00:05:54.960> and<00:05:55.050> one<00:05:55.340> 1400<00:05:56.340> seems<00:05:56.670> like<00:05:56.880> round

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.150 
thousand and one 1400 seems like round

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:58.820 
thousand and one 1400 seems like round
two<00:05:57.390> is<00:05:57.540> pretty<00:05:57.720> much<00:05:57.960> committed<00:05:58.350> to<00:05:58.470> the<00:05:58.680> one

00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:58.830 
two is pretty much committed to the one

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:02.390 
two is pretty much committed to the one
1000<00:05:59.580> scale<00:05:59.990> but<00:06:00.990> the<00:06:01.110> one<00:06:01.230> 1400<00:06:02.070> would<00:06:02.250> be

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 
1000 scale but the one 1400 would be

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.060 
1000 scale but the one 1400 would be
nice<00:06:02.610> too<00:06:02.970> I<00:06:03.170> think<00:06:04.170> I'd<00:06:04.320> rather<00:06:04.470> have<00:06:04.620> a<00:06:04.800> one

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:05.070 
nice too I think I'd rather have a one

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:08.330 
nice too I think I'd rather have a one
1000<00:06:05.730> scale<00:06:06.030> of<00:06:06.270> the<00:06:06.420> D<00:06:06.600> though<00:06:06.840> I'd<00:06:07.620> be<00:06:07.950> just<00:06:08.220> a

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:08.340 
1000 scale of the D though I'd be just a

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.660 
1000 scale of the D though I'd be just a
little<00:06:08.670> bit<00:06:09.060> huger
