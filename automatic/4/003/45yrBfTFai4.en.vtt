00:00:01.869 --> 00:00:03.370
 in your opinion 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:06.790
 the intelligent infantry system demonstrates who is 

00:00:09.489 --> 00:00:12.489
 an advance of the courts the teachings 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:19.949
 It costs a lot to have a good relationship 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.279
 actually 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:22.630
 A relationship 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:23.759
 It is not bad or good 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:26.710
 it was exactly the same 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.499
 and there are two reasons why he assured 

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:34.100
 the first is that if you and your partner invest a lot in a relationship but the 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.250
 joy they get from it is extraordinary then the cost is 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.770
 totally irrelevant 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.270
 whereas if you invest very little 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.230
 I do not know prepo in tano solved their problems they do not recognize they are not open 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.960
 emotionally etc. 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.250
 then definitely the coso within your relationship will be very little 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.910
 so any investment in this pair will seem extremely expensive 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:57.890
 but nevertheless 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.140
 both values ​​are totally relative 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.070
 and while on one occasion it seemed very inexpensive while the other 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.880
 appeared high cost actually 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.460
 the cost is exactly the same 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.860
 lourido change was the joy you received as a result of that relationship 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:16.690
 on the other hand 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.250
 some people think it's easier 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.860
 and definitely less expensive 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.650
 maintaining a mediocre relationship 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.950
 where neither party commits to each other 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.350
 and therefore 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.680
 they consider that there is no investment 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.970
 that way they believe that there is no risk of losing and that anything 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.960
 that can draw from that relationship is already gain 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:38.960
 but nevertheless 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.490
 those people unfortunately 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.180
 does not have a very broad perspective of their lives and they only get to see very 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.760
 short term so they believe that what does not cost them from the beginning is a 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.280
 good investment 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.390
 thus 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.340
 those couples who only stay together 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.570
 While they find someone better they create a dynamic in their lives 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.370
 shortage 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:06.590
 which always in the medium and long term will charge them ap only also that 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.949
 everything they did not invest from the beginning 

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:12.989
 and they will be charged with interest because even when each of them changed 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.989
 of a couple and I came to believe that it starts again from scratch 

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:17.459
 actually 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.929
 everything that person did not invest in their past relationships 

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:24.169
 will accumulate here will continue to charge interest in the following relationship 

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:28.579
 to this some people call it divine justice 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:31.109
 and some hours maybe they call it karma 

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:32.309
 but nevertheless 

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:35.499
 this is nothing more than simple hand conditioning 

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:40.189
 well if you remember we act 95% unconsciously 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.980
 and it is there in this mind and conscious where our form is registered 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:45.919
 Act 

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:49.469
 and in that way a behavior model for the future is created 

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:51.559
 which is very difficult to get rid of 

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:56.469
 especially if you continue to operate from the unconscious and keep yourself in a 

00:02:56.469 --> 00:02:58.369
 state of denial 

00:02:58.369 --> 00:03:02.639
 On the contrary, if you choose to invest in yourself and your next relationship of 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:07.099
 couple from this moment you will be giving the value that the priority that 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:08.310
 they have your life 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.459
 from today you are going to be programming to turn it off ideal summit is forbidden and 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.890
 you know that you deserve this ideal man 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:18.900
 because you always invest in the best and this type of investment with balance 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.990
 positive will also follow you to any relationship you go 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.190
 it will be recorded between unconscious 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.769
 It will be taxed in how you value hours who is with you 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.770
 in how you value yourself 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.410
 and above all in how you expect to experience this new relationship 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:39.809
 so he is a loader when lying day after in his chapter number 4 

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:43.879
 you will be able to obtain the tools that allow to eradicate any balance 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:46.099
 negative that I could carry inside 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:47.309
 and that maybe 

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:50.309
 today is what I am telling you to have a proper relationship said 

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:53.449
 so that the pp reinvents itself 

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:54.609
 seven days 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:57.739
 discover you have to go back 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:00.739
 sometimes this material full gemelli feet 

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:02.729
 enter or not
