00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:06.270
 yes 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.700
 in that sense the analyst of that locality 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:11.420
 First of all read 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.200
 the blows four crimes 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.809
 the centers to be able 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:16.070
 using them 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.070
 first of all we have the Monaco where the psc 

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:22.130
 the own touches ap the program 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.810
 pokémon platinum 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.970
 and sports fatigue saved 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.550
 first of all we will do the processing 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.659
 we will use in 

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:32.460
 the cameras button 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.460
 we will prevent the file from the website 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.530
 As you can see we can modify anything in the saved game 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.790
 in front of the rival 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:47.730
 player the boxes 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.230
 accessories 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.110
 more neatly we will teach how to modify a little bit of annoyance which is what 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.480
 that normally people 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.320
 first of all he 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.010
 You can see that I have 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.010
 what we will do is save the diary file 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.450
 we will keep it 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.149
 then we will not load victory in one of the houses of the tc 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.450
 to load the own mockus 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.450
 as noted after opening 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.460
 in the travel file 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.470
 now already tense 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:24.609
 guided in the 

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:26.640
 in the first game of the first box 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.450
 but we do not want them to be declared 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.450
 this is what we can 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.960
 from here we will find 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.960
 practically paralyzed all the data of the we can 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.610
 first 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.590
 we have a little 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.590
 let's take for example picasso 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.320
 and we will put him 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.110
 the pulse of east boston 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.740
 will be your first team 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.740
 but you can also modify it 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.859
 the level of the picacho 

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:13.879
 the experience points automatically assumes 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:16.879
 friendship 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.269
 for the possible revolution 

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:26.339
 pressing the button create with tomato reels 

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:31.279
 those of nature 

00:02:31.279 --> 00:02:34.329
 guille be male 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:37.589
 finished partners 

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:40.469
 we put the 

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:42.829
 everything to 31 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:45.829
 and 352 points are forced by attacks 

00:02:46.929 --> 00:02:49.139
 and in speed 

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:52.139
 from here we can put the marks 

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:56.729
 from here the profile of why not 

00:02:58.199 --> 00:03:01.289
 with everything 

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:04.289
 now from here we can choose the attacks 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:29.109
 from here we could avoid the fish 

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:35.809
 names how it works although seville 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:38.019
 in the skill 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:41.209
 we can put any skill 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:42.709
 to see 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:45.709
 where for example 

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:51.469
 and captured with 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:54.859
 from here we can put 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:56.529
 the 

00:03:56.529 --> 00:03:59.529
 according to sex in the stretch 

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:11.129
 one 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:12.319
 this engine 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:15.319
 we can the original name of the short touch in this case perhaps 

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:18.870
 from here 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.359
 we put now 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.449
 the country from which the picacho comes 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:24.199
 in this case Spain 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:27.199
 and now I see that we can avoid it here 

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:33.389
 he was only against them 

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:35.639
 the route 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:38.889
 301 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:41.889
 found a day 

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:46.379
 telmex 7 2 

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:49.379
 the team of the vital west 

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:53.469
 let's say I have all 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:58.229
 from here to him 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.499
 actively involves stressed 

00:05:03.499 --> 00:05:06.499
 this I recommend that they do not modify the law 

00:05:10.499 --> 00:05:13.650
 and this is stopped to change forms to the pokémon 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:14.580
 In this case, yes 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.249
 union we can only change it 

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:19.249
 it does not work for oxygen 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:23.639
 Once the vertical is finished, because the affected person 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.120
 return the accept 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:29.240
 and that was the pokémon 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.270
 then press the button 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.039
 more than once 

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:36.150
 saved 7 8 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.150
 is for safety and so that 

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:50.159
 then you can embody 

00:05:54.059 --> 00:05:55.419
 if they have masks com 

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:58.419
 wen expressed r4 

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:20.849
 police for each 

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:23.849
 now we will open 6 

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:28.199
 after doing express 

00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:31.379
 in any kind of 

00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:33.169
 of the cascajal 

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:36.119
 ccoo is going out of his own game 

00:06:36.119 --> 00:06:39.119
 but I do it for what 

00:06:39.999 --> 00:06:42.999
 as certainly center 

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:55.580
 amaury 

00:07:11.469 --> 00:07:12.719
 slowly 

00:07:12.719 --> 00:07:15.719
 do not 

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:19.330
 now 

00:07:23.719 --> 00:07:26.559
 tohá 

00:07:26.559 --> 00:07:29.559
 kaos 

00:07:36.189 --> 00:07:39.189
 advance 

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:43.050
 as you can see that they solve their problems but 

00:07:45.789 --> 00:07:48.409
 as a full member 

00:07:48.409 --> 00:07:50.119
 in front of the others 

00:07:50.119 --> 00:07:53.119
 the modest forest 

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:09.199
 well then 

00:08:09.199 --> 00:08:11.449
 practically everything is already said 

00:08:11.449 --> 00:08:13.129
 Continuous stops 

00:08:13.129 --> 00:08:16.240
 I learned the most he uses curacao 

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.230
 if we got caught next
