00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.450
 we have butane in our home how much 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:09.719
 warm water makes us enjoy 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:13.730
 bouncing butane that slut comfort no 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.730
 it's saving whore is not welfare 

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:26.760

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:31.290
 I became friends with 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:35.590
 castaway castaway four drunks 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:39.940
 in the month of April of suicides that 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:41.610
 they ran in the opposite direction bordering 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.740
 the wounds 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.740
 when night fell 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:54.670
 no other lair than the wine of a kiss 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:58.899
 and a mess of poems tattooed on the 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:03.490
 body with no more future plans than a 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:09.670
 drawing and sweet dirty panties 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:11.810
 sunset shot we advance like wolves 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.869
 they bit 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:18.759
 everything the sun raised to our 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:20.010
 sight with success and without fortune 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:21.220
 we stumble 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:25.380
 [Music] 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:28.570
 with pitfalls that we were looking for in a jump 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:32.830
 we saw the shame that water goes 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:34.150
 parties the madness that slept in the 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:39.520
 sidewalks 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:44.740
 we had not had a shower for two months 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.740
 dragging all the flavor of summer 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.890
 [Music] 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.910
 ah 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:58.890
 [Music] 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:02:03.009
 climbing telephone booths 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:07.719
 awaiting the call of the boom bum of a 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:09.990
 beat crew of the boat so drunk 

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:16.920
 of rhythm 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:16.920
