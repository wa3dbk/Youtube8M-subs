00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.730
 mills we ask your friend so he 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.370

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.700
 windmill as we see in person 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.310
 we got up 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.110
 so to say windmill 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.150
 a little up when you throw it away 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.060
 your friend she rises and after 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.840
 several such so tell you any 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.880
 sticky velcro 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.270
 you try at the machine push push 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.990
 and after these derby with this wind 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.000
 the mill 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.190
 you still get to move it with 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.840
 places after long attempts to me all the same 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.270
 it turned out to drop this wind 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.370
 the mill as you now see what it is 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.410
 after that the inclination began to fall and 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.200
 it's very cool after that on 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:50.030
 may begin to somehow fall with the gods and 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.340
 after that you try on her 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.350
 jump so that from them even the current was 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.940
 so that not just the mill dropped 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.460
 namely tried to make from it 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.860
 some kind of catapult call the machines 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.740
 your high customize it so 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.560
 say pillar and try to get on 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.800
 this table to make it somehow 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.170
 catapult with this windmill 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.470
 after which we jump on this pillar 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.330
 and try to run to the center of this windmill 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.760
