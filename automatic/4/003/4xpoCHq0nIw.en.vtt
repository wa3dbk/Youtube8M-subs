00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
intake on a 96 97 Honda Civic this is a

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.060 
intake on a 96 97 Honda Civic this is a
cheap<00:00:20.460> ebay<00:00:20.939> intake<00:00:21.599> and<00:00:21.900> I'm<00:00:22.560> fairly<00:00:22.770> happy

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
cheap ebay intake and I'm fairly happy

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.880 
cheap ebay intake and I'm fairly happy
with<00:00:23.189> it<00:00:23.400> works<00:00:23.579> out<00:00:23.849> really<00:00:24.029> well<00:00:27.649> you<00:00:28.649> can<00:00:28.680> do

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
with it works out really well you can do

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.249 
with it works out really well you can do
this<00:00:29.099> one<00:00:29.369> of<00:00:29.399> two<00:00:29.520> ways<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.719> first<00:00:30.899> way<00:00:31.079> is<00:00:31.169> a

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:31.259 
this one of two ways the first way is a

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:33.819 
this one of two ways the first way is a
little<00:00:31.439> bit<00:00:31.559> easier<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.160> it<00:00:32.820> only<00:00:32.940> removes

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 
little bit easier and it only removes

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:39.200 
little bit easier and it only removes
the<00:00:34.829> filter<00:00:35.190> housing<00:00:36.590> the<00:00:37.590> second<00:00:38.040> way<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.309> you

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
the filter housing the second way is you

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.770 
the filter housing the second way is you
can<00:00:39.300> remove<00:00:39.600> this<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.969> the<00:00:41.969> muffler<00:00:42.300> box<00:00:42.539> and

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
can remove this and the muffler box and

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.230 
can remove this and the muffler box and
the<00:00:42.840> u-shape<00:00:43.230> elbow<00:00:43.710> if<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:44.670> leave<00:00:44.820> this<00:00:44.970> in

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:45.240 
the u-shape elbow if you leave this in

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.080 
the u-shape elbow if you leave this in
it's<00:00:45.600> really<00:00:45.780> not<00:00:46.230> in<00:00:46.560> the<00:00:46.980> way<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.670> a<00:00:47.760> short

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
it's really not in the way of a short

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.540 
it's really not in the way of a short
Ram<00:00:48.329> intake<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.990> cold<00:00:49.770> air<00:00:49.920> intake<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.340> would<00:00:50.489> be

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
Ram intake a cold air intake it would be

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.300 
Ram intake a cold air intake it would be
in<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.670> way<00:00:50.790> remove<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.390> air<00:00:51.540> filter<00:00:51.900> housing

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:52.310 
in the way remove the air filter housing

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:57.700 
in the way remove the air filter housing
is<00:00:53.310> very<00:00:53.579> simple<00:00:54.920> first<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:56.880> want<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.090> locate

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
is very simple first you want to locate

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.870 
is very simple first you want to locate
your<00:00:58.710> sensor<00:00:59.220> right<00:01:00.000> here<00:01:01.430> then<00:01:02.430> pull<00:01:02.730> your

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:02.880 
your sensor right here then pull your

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.800 
your sensor right here then pull your
pipe<00:01:03.120> out<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.500> your<00:01:04.619> housing<00:01:05.479> then<00:01:06.479> all<00:01:06.720> you

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
pipe out of your housing then all you

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.459 
pipe out of your housing then all you
have<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.079> do<00:01:07.229> is<00:01:07.649> loosen<00:01:08.399> these<00:01:08.729> two<00:01:08.970> screws

00:01:09.459 --> 00:01:09.469 
have to do is loosen these two screws

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:14.890 
have to do is loosen these two screws
right<00:01:10.469> here<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:11.689> the<00:01:12.689> clamp<00:01:12.990> right<00:01:13.950> here<00:01:14.280> and

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
right here and the clamp right here and

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:20.149 
right here and the clamp right here and
it<00:01:15.900> pulls<00:01:16.200> right<00:01:16.560> out<00:01:18.770> now<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:19.830> can<00:01:20.040> actually

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
it pulls right out now you can actually

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.090 
it pulls right out now you can actually
go<00:01:20.400> ahead<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:20.760> install<00:01:20.940> this<00:01:21.330> or<00:01:21.799> go<00:01:22.799> ahead

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
go ahead and install this or go ahead

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.310 
go ahead and install this or go ahead
and<00:01:23.340> take<00:01:23.520> out<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.909> u-shaped<00:01:24.330> tubing<00:01:24.780> which

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
and take out the u-shaped tubing which

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.740 
and take out the u-shaped tubing which
will<00:01:25.500> be<00:01:25.590> right<00:01:25.770> here<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.190> right<00:01:26.940> here<00:01:26.970> this

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
will be right here and right here this

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.030 
will be right here and right here this
is<00:01:27.930> more<00:01:28.080> difficult<00:01:28.229> because<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:28.770> have<00:01:28.950> to

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
is more difficult because you have to

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.020 
is more difficult because you have to
get<00:01:29.159> under<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.670> car<00:01:31.340> turn<00:01:32.340> your<00:01:32.549> tire<00:01:32.760> and

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
get under the car turn your tire and

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.460 
get under the car turn your tire and
pull<00:01:34.190> out<00:01:35.190> some<00:01:35.570> pins<00:01:36.570> right<00:01:36.780> here<00:01:37.020> so<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.320> can

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
pull out some pins right here so you can

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.359 
pull out some pins right here so you can
pull<00:01:37.740> this<00:01:37.860> undercarriage<00:01:38.520> off<00:01:39.560> then<00:01:40.560> by

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
pull this undercarriage off then by

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.190 
pull this undercarriage off then by
loosening<00:01:41.729> one<00:01:42.000> bolt<00:01:42.240> inside<00:01:43.200> of<00:01:43.409> here<00:01:45.200> it'll

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
loosening one bolt inside of here it'll

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.179 
loosening one bolt inside of here it'll
fall<00:01:46.470> right<00:01:46.740> out<00:01:48.530> this<00:01:49.530> is<00:01:49.710> actually<00:01:49.979> how<00:01:50.040> it's

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
fall right out this is actually how it's

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.350 
fall right out this is actually how it's
positioned<00:01:50.640> in<00:01:50.729> your<00:01:50.880> car

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
positioned in your car

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.210 
put it that's what it was with this

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.110 
put it that's what it was with this
piece<00:03:01.480> so<00:03:01.770> what<00:03:02.770> I<00:03:02.800> just<00:03:03.010> did<00:03:03.190> is<00:03:03.580> a<00:03:03.670> flat<00:03:03.940> piece

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
piece so what I just did is a flat piece

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.480 
piece so what I just did is a flat piece
of<00:03:04.180> metal<00:03:04.470> and<00:03:05.470> I<00:03:05.680> knew<00:03:05.830> it<00:03:05.950> had<00:03:06.130> to<00:03:06.160> attach

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.490

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.230 
of metal and I knew it had to attach
here<00:03:07.410> so<00:03:08.410> I<00:03:08.440> just<00:03:08.530> bent<00:03:08.950> it<00:03:09.130> to<00:03:09.280> fit<00:03:09.520> and<00:03:09.760> zip

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:10.240 
here so I just bent it to fit and zip

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.020 
here so I just bent it to fit and zip
tied<00:03:10.450> it<00:03:10.570> tight<00:03:10.950> then<00:03:11.950> take<00:03:12.160> now<00:03:12.370> cannot<00:03:12.850> go

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
tied it tight then take now cannot go

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.750 
tied it tight then take now cannot go
anywhere<00:03:13.270> and<00:03:13.620> now<00:03:14.620> since<00:03:15.100> a<00:03:15.250> short<00:03:15.580> Ram

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
intake doesn't do me much good because I

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:18.780 
intake doesn't do me much good because I
don't<00:03:17.530> have<00:03:17.740> a<00:03:17.770> hood<00:03:18.070> scoop<00:03:18.190> or<00:03:18.460> any<00:03:18.610> way<00:03:18.730> to

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
ram the air into the intake and I didn't

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.730 
ram the air into the intake and I didn't
want<00:03:21.970> to<00:03:22.000> do<00:03:22.120> a<00:03:22.150> cold<00:03:22.540> air<00:03:22.750> intake<00:03:22.780> because<00:03:23.650> it

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:23.740 
want to do a cold air intake because it

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
want to do a cold air intake because it
would<00:03:23.860> place<00:03:24.300> the<00:03:25.300> end<00:03:26.290> of<00:03:26.590> the<00:03:26.770> filter<00:03:27.340> inside

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
would place the end of the filter inside

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.510 
would place the end of the filter inside
my<00:03:28.440> bumper<00:03:29.440> and<00:03:29.470> my<00:03:29.830> car<00:03:30.040> is<00:03:30.160> low<00:03:30.310> to<00:03:30.370> the

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
it is fairly wet mostly here so it

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:35.940 
it is fairly wet mostly here so it
wasn't<00:03:34.870> really<00:03:34.900> a<00:03:35.140> good<00:03:35.350> idea<00:03:35.380> and<00:03:35.680> I<00:03:35.740> didn't

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
wasn't really a good idea and I didn't

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
want a chance that's my engine so since

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.640 
want a chance that's my engine so since

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:44.110 
and sand that just got shot into the
inside<00:04:41.750> of<00:04:41.810> this<00:04:41.960> intake<00:04:42.349> before<00:04:42.789> I've<00:04:43.789> also

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
inside of this intake before I've also

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.809 
inside of this intake before I've also
added<00:04:44.389> a<00:04:44.630> heat<00:04:44.870> shield<00:04:45.430> keep<00:04:46.430> the<00:04:46.639> two

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:46.819 
added a heat shield keep the two

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:49.210 
added a heat shield keep the two
compartments<00:04:47.300> separated<00:04:47.660> so<00:04:48.620> the<00:04:48.770> cold<00:04:49.009> air

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
compartments separated so the cold air

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:52.330 
compartments separated so the cold air
stays<00:04:49.789> in<00:04:50.000> here<00:04:50.300> and<00:04:50.509> the<00:04:51.110> warmer<00:04:51.380> air<00:04:51.590> is<00:04:51.830> off

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
stays in here and the warmer air is off

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.909 
stays in here and the warmer air is off
on<00:04:52.610> this<00:04:52.849> side<00:04:53.060> this<00:04:53.569> works<00:04:53.840> really<00:04:54.199> well<00:04:54.470> by

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:54.919 
on this side this works really well by

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:57.550 
on this side this works really well by
the<00:04:54.979> test<00:04:55.520> shows<00:04:56.030> that<00:04:56.060> it<00:04:56.419> creates<00:04:56.750> or<00:04:56.990> a<00:04:57.139> 20

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
the test shows that it creates or a 20

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.560 
the test shows that it creates or a 20
degree<00:04:57.710> temperature<00:04:58.460> difference<00:04:58.580> without

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
degree temperature difference without

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.219 
degree temperature difference without
this<00:05:01.030> the<00:05:02.030> intake<00:05:02.300> would<00:05:02.479> just<00:05:02.630> suck<00:05:02.810> in<00:05:03.020> all

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:03.229 
this the intake would just suck in all

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:05.290 
this the intake would just suck in all
of<00:05:03.470> the<00:05:03.590> hot<00:05:03.800> engine<00:05:04.070> air<00:05:04.400> radiating<00:05:04.940> off<00:05:05.060> the

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
of the hot engine air radiating off the

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.990 
of the hot engine air radiating off the
engine<00:05:05.570> and<00:05:05.630> transmission
