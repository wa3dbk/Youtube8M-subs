that's<00:02:56.409> a<00:02:56.500> good<00:02:56.650> judge<00:02:56.950> but<00:02:57.459> fair<00:02:58.000> enough<00:02:58.030> if

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
that's a good judge but fair enough if

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:59.819 
that's a good judge but fair enough if
you<00:02:58.480> got<00:02:58.599> a<00:02:58.629> million<00:02:58.840> pound<00:02:59.200> house<00:02:59.409> you<00:02:59.650> done
