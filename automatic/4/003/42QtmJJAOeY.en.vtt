thought goes into everything and how
there<00:01:58.050> is<00:01:58.170> actually<00:01:58.440> thought<00:01:58.620> going<00:01:58.800> into

00:01:58.970 --> 00:01:58.980 
there is actually thought going into

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.260 
there is actually thought going into
making<00:01:59.400> me<00:01:59.490> a<00:01:59.520> better<00:01:59.700> and<00:02:00.060> more<00:02:00.090> responsible

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
making me a better and more responsible

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.690 
making me a better and more responsible
and<00:02:01.110> I've<00:02:01.560> been<00:02:01.710> quite<00:02:01.800> surprised<00:02:02.190> by<00:02:02.550> that

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
and I've been quite surprised by that

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.840 
and I've been quite surprised by that
have<00:02:03.630> your<00:02:03.870> perceptions<00:02:04.500> changed<00:02:05.010> anyway<00:02:05.400> I

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
have your perceptions changed anyway I

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.430 
have your perceptions changed anyway I
think<00:02:06.270> my<00:02:06.390> perceptions<00:02:06.840> change<00:02:07.050> because

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
think my perceptions change because

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.170 
think my perceptions change because
you're<00:02:07.620> being<00:02:07.740> so<00:02:07.830> transparent<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.670> so<00:02:08.820> open

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:09.180 
you're being so transparent and so open

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:10.520 
you're being so transparent and so open
and<00:02:09.420> you're<00:02:09.510> not<00:02:09.630> afraid<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:09.960> answer<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.410> hard

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
and you're not afraid to answer the hard

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.080 
and you're not afraid to answer the hard
questions<00:02:10.619> we've<00:02:11.610> been<00:02:11.730> completely

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
questions we've been completely

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.090 
questions we've been completely
approached<00:02:12.540> honest<00:02:12.990> from<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:13.890> high

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
approached honest from the high

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.530 
approached honest from the high
standards<00:02:14.580> I<00:02:14.700> think<00:02:14.730> that<00:02:14.970> there<00:02:15.120> are<00:02:15.150> behind

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
standards I think that there are behind

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.890 
standards I think that there are behind
the<00:02:15.630> scenes<00:02:15.660> it's<00:02:16.170> very<00:02:16.530> impressive
