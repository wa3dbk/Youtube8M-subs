00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.079 

so<00:00:03.480> these<00:00:03.810> now<00:00:04.049> in<00:00:04.620> video<00:00:04.890> mode<00:00:04.920> you<00:00:05.730> know<00:00:05.850> that

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
so these now in video mode you know that

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:07.880 
so these now in video mode you know that
demonstrates<00:00:06.690> the<00:00:06.960> benefits<00:00:07.440> of<00:00:07.649> having

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
demonstrates the benefits of having

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.759 
demonstrates the benefits of having
optical<00:00:08.639> image<00:00:08.970> stabilization<00:00:09.590> so<00:00:10.590> now<00:00:10.710> you

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
optical image stabilization so now you

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.580 
optical image stabilization so now you
can<00:00:11.010> see<00:00:11.190> it's<00:00:11.820> not<00:00:11.969> recording<00:00:12.540> so<00:00:13.469> the

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
can see it's not recording so the

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.310 
can see it's not recording so the
stabilisation<00:00:14.280> is<00:00:14.610> for<00:00:14.849> you<00:00:15.630> can<00:00:15.809> see<00:00:15.990> what

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
stabilisation is for you can see what

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.290 
stabilisation is for you can see what
happens<00:00:16.710> when<00:00:16.920> we<00:00:17.070> hit<00:00:17.250> record<00:00:17.670> and<00:00:17.880> over<00:00:18.180> is

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
happens when we hit record and over is

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.679 
happens when we hit record and over is
15<00:00:19.430> so<00:00:20.430> now<00:00:20.550> it's<00:00:20.699> recording<00:00:20.820> I'm<00:00:21.300> still<00:00:21.570> doing

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
15 so now it's recording I'm still doing

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.070 
15 so now it's recording I'm still doing
the<00:00:21.869> exactly<00:00:22.199> same<00:00:22.289> shape<00:00:22.710> you<00:00:23.310> can<00:00:23.460> see<00:00:23.640> that

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.080 
the exactly same shape you can see that

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.850 
the exactly same shape you can see that
it's<00:00:25.080> practically<00:00:26.039> stable

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:27.860 
it's practically stable

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.310 
it's practically stable
and<00:00:28.400> it's<00:00:28.790> not<00:00:28.940> even<00:00:29.000> a<00:00:29.390> standard<00:00:29.840> handshake

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
and it's not even a standard handshake

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.080 
and it's not even a standard handshake
it's<00:00:30.530> a<00:00:30.620> proper<00:00:30.860> if<00:00:31.100> you<00:00:31.220> have<00:00:31.400> this<00:00:31.580> handshake

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
it's a proper if you have this handshake

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.360 
it's a proper if you have this handshake
please<00:00:32.330> go<00:00:32.510> to<00:00:32.570> the<00:00:32.720> doctor<00:00:32.960> type<00:00:33.350> of<00:00:33.500> movement

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
please go to the doctor type of movement

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.670 
please go to the doctor type of movement
that<00:00:34.640> we<00:00:34.820> are<00:00:34.910> in<00:00:35.150> here

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
that we are in here

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.890 
that we are in here
so<00:00:37.190> that's<00:00:37.370> the<00:00:37.550> benefit<00:00:37.910> of<00:00:38.000> our<00:00:38.180> wires<00:00:38.600> in

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:38.900 
so that's the benefit of our wires in

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.410 
so that's the benefit of our wires in
medium<00:00:39.230> let<00:00:40.010> me<00:00:40.070> do<00:00:40.220> another<00:00:40.430> video<00:00:40.880> the

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
medium let me do another video the

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.990 
medium let me do another video the
handheld<00:00:41.930> video<00:00:42.080> from<00:00:42.500> Wisconsin

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:01:02.860 

a<00:00:47.060> 10<00:00:48.050> second<00:00:48.380> video

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.109 

and<00:01:03.350> now<00:01:03.530> when<00:01:03.739> you<00:01:03.829> play<00:01:04.010> back<00:01:04.220> the<00:01:04.369> video<00:01:04.549> you

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
and now when you play back the video you

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:06.670 
and now when you play back the video you
can<00:01:05.239> see<00:01:05.449> how<00:01:05.659> it<00:01:05.720> looks<00:01:05.869> like<00:01:06.170> there<00:01:06.380> is<00:01:06.409> being

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
can see how it looks like there is being

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.250 
can see how it looks like there is being
practically<00:01:07.190> shot<00:01:07.450> with<00:01:08.450> the<00:01:08.540> tripod<00:01:08.990> or

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
practically shot with the tripod or

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.710 
practically shot with the tripod or
Steadicam<00:01:10.100> or<00:01:10.400> some<00:01:10.760> other<00:01:10.909> professional

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
Steadicam or some other professional

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:25.760 
Steadicam or some other professional
teacher<00:01:11.930> that's<00:01:12.530> how<00:01:12.710> table

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.560 

okay<00:01:26.369> now<00:01:26.579> we<00:01:26.640> have<00:01:26.759> some<00:01:26.909> side-by-side

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
okay now we have some side-by-side

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.510 
okay now we have some side-by-side
comparison<00:01:28.170> videos<00:01:28.469> okay<00:01:29.100> so<00:01:29.159> on<00:01:29.429> the

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
comparison videos okay so on the

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.370 
comparison videos okay so on the
right-hand<00:01:29.700> side<00:01:29.939> we<00:01:30.119> have<00:01:30.359> the<00:01:30.539> Lumia<00:01:30.869> 920

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
right-hand side we have the Lumia 920

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.529 
right-hand side we have the Lumia 920
few<00:01:31.590> of<00:01:31.679> you<00:01:31.799> on<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.579> left-hand<00:01:33.060> side<00:01:33.149> we<00:01:33.329> have

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:33.539 
few of you on the left-hand side we have

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:35.990 
few of you on the left-hand side we have
one<00:01:33.899> of<00:01:33.929> our<00:01:34.110> from<00:01:34.409> competing<00:01:35.000> smartphones

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
one of our from competing smartphones

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.120 
one of our from competing smartphones
and<00:01:36.479> pay<00:01:37.020> attention<00:01:37.049> that<00:01:37.649> the<00:01:37.740> left<00:01:37.950> hand

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
and pay attention that the left hand

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.539 
and pay attention that the left hand
side<00:01:38.219> device<00:01:39.149> actually<00:01:39.479> has<00:01:39.929> digital

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
side device actually has digital

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:43.490 
side device actually has digital
stabilization<00:01:41.549> enabled<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.600> can<00:01:42.630> see<00:01:42.929> how<00:01:43.170> oh

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
stabilization enabled you can see how oh

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.789 
stabilization enabled you can see how oh
it's<00:01:44.250> not<00:01:44.460> doesn't<00:01:44.909> manage<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.799> compensate

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
it's not doesn't manage to compensate

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.830 
it's not doesn't manage to compensate
for<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.069> handshake<00:01:47.520> in<00:01:47.939> standard<00:01:48.450> indoor

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
for the handshake in standard indoor

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.800 
for the handshake in standard indoor
situations<00:01:49.819> and<00:01:50.819> in<00:01:51.000> this<00:01:51.119> video<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.569> two

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.569 
situations and in this video the two
devices<00:01:51.990> may<00:01:52.439> actually<00:01:52.590> attach<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.219> cables

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
devices may actually attach the cables

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.669 
devices may actually attach the cables
for<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.819> amount<00:01:54.119> of<00:01:54.270> handshake<00:01:54.750> involve<00:01:55.530> of
