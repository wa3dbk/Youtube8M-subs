00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
challenging and one thing that there's a

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.640 
challenging and one thing that there's a
very<00:03:53.580> big<00:03:53.760> problem<00:03:53.940> I'm<00:03:54.660> not<00:03:54.900> like<00:03:55.140> you<00:03:55.380> know

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
very big problem I'm not like you know

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.470 
very big problem I'm not like you know
bashing<00:03:56.160> on<00:03:56.250> anything<00:03:56.490> is<00:03:56.790> that<00:03:57.000> if<00:03:57.150> you<00:03:57.270> saw

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
bashing on anything is that if you saw

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.360 
bashing on anything is that if you saw
there<00:03:57.720> those<00:03:58.050> mongooses<00:03:58.620> are<00:03:58.770> spawning<00:03:59.040> right

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
there those mongooses are spawning right

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.550 
there those mongooses are spawning right
where<00:03:59.550> that<00:03:59.580> thing<00:03:59.850> right<00:04:00.270> where<00:04:00.480> the<00:04:00.600> the

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
where that thing right where the the

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.250 
where that thing right where the the
turn<00:04:01.800> starts<00:04:02.250> and<00:04:02.400> we<00:04:03.270> the<00:04:03.660> first<00:04:03.900> game<00:04:04.230> that

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
turn starts and we the first game that

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.530 
turn starts and we the first game that
we<00:04:04.470> played<00:04:04.680> with<00:04:04.800> this<00:04:04.950> was<00:04:05.220> insane<00:04:05.940> because<00:04:06.210> I

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
we played with this was insane because I

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.620 
we played with this was insane because I
think<00:04:06.690> we<00:04:07.200> fell<00:04:07.680> off<00:04:07.709> that<00:04:08.220> for<00:04:08.790> we<00:04:09.060> tried<00:04:09.300> like

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
think we fell off that for we tried like

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.090 
think we fell off that for we tried like
we<00:04:09.900> played<00:04:10.050> for<00:04:10.260> 10<00:04:10.410> minutes<00:04:10.620> then<00:04:10.740> just<00:04:10.980> kept

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
we played for 10 minutes then just kept

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.390 
we played for 10 minutes then just kept
falling<00:04:11.400> off<00:04:11.459> it<00:04:11.940> was<00:04:12.060> awful<00:04:12.450> um<00:04:12.630> so<00:04:13.400> that's

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
falling off it was awful um so that's

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.710 
falling off it was awful um so that's
just<00:04:14.490> one<00:04:14.640> thing<00:04:14.790> he<00:04:15.060> can<00:04:15.180> you<00:04:15.450> know<00:04:15.510> you<00:04:15.630> can

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
just one thing he can you know you can

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.900 
just one thing he can you know you can
improve<00:04:16.049> on<00:04:16.230> it's<00:04:16.470> just<00:04:16.560> to<00:04:17.459> get<00:04:17.609> doughnuts<00:04:17.850> if

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
improve on it's just to get doughnuts if

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.340 
improve on it's just to get doughnuts if
you're<00:04:18.030> watching<00:04:18.150> them<00:04:18.450> the<00:04:18.720> video<00:04:18.989> is<00:04:19.320> just

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
you're watching them the video is just

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.070 
you're watching them the video is just
to<00:04:19.980> move<00:04:20.400> that<00:04:20.730> spawn<00:04:21.090> point<00:04:21.450> back<00:04:21.660> just<00:04:21.989> a

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.080 
to move that spawn point back just a

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.580 
to move that spawn point back just a
little<00:04:22.109> bit<00:04:23.210> because<00:04:24.210> you<00:04:24.600> know<00:04:24.750> you<00:04:25.320> know<00:04:25.410> if

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
little bit because you know you know if

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:26.810 
little bit because you know you know if
you<00:04:25.740> review<00:04:26.130> race<00:04:26.310> some<00:04:26.430> of<00:04:26.490> the<00:04:26.550> time<00:04:26.669> people

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
you review race some of the time people

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.010 
you review race some of the time people
you<00:04:27.060> know<00:04:27.150> you<00:04:27.240> have<00:04:27.360> like<00:04:27.540> five<00:04:27.750> people

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
you know you have like five people

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.240 
you know you have like five people
spawning<00:04:28.290> that<00:04:28.500> spot<00:04:28.710> you<00:04:28.860> just<00:04:29.010> don't<00:04:29.160> have

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
spawning that spot you just don't have

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:30.920 
spawning that spot you just don't have
enough<00:04:29.340> speed<00:04:29.610> to<00:04:29.669> make<00:04:29.970> the<00:04:30.150> turn<00:04:30.360> you'll

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
enough speed to make the turn you'll

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.690 
enough speed to make the turn you'll
never<00:04:31.140> it's<00:04:31.680> really<00:04:31.980> hard<00:04:32.160> to<00:04:32.280> make<00:04:32.400> that<00:04:32.430> turn

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
never it's really hard to make that turn

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.430 
never it's really hard to make that turn
unless<00:04:32.910> like<00:04:33.210> nobody<00:04:33.570> else<00:04:33.690> ponds<00:04:33.930> around<00:04:34.110> you

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
unless like nobody else ponds around you

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.590 
unless like nobody else ponds around you
so<00:04:35.430> that's<00:04:35.669> just<00:04:35.730> what<00:04:36.030> that's<00:04:36.210> like<00:04:36.390> the<00:04:36.570> only

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
so that's just what that's like the only

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.330 
so that's just what that's like the only
problem<00:04:37.320> I<00:04:37.350> really<00:04:37.380> saw<00:04:37.770> in<00:04:37.890> this<00:04:37.980> map<00:04:38.160> other

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
problem I really saw in this map other

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.850 
problem I really saw in this map other
than<00:04:38.460> that<00:04:38.550> the<00:04:38.820> jumps<00:04:39.180> all<00:04:39.330> work<00:04:39.690> I've<00:04:40.590> raced

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
than that the jumps all work I've raced

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.710 
than that the jumps all work I've raced
it<00:04:41.070> you<00:04:41.160> know<00:04:41.280> 10<00:04:41.610> 10<00:04:41.850> times<00:04:42.120> and<00:04:42.419> every<00:04:42.570> single

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
it you know 10 10 times and every single

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.270 
it you know 10 10 times and every single
lap<00:04:42.960> all<00:04:43.200> the<00:04:43.320> jumps<00:04:43.620> have<00:04:43.740> worked<00:04:43.950> and<00:04:44.190> I've

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
lap all the jumps have worked and I've

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.830 
lap all the jumps have worked and I've
you<00:04:44.490> know<00:04:44.520> landed<00:04:44.940> smoothly<00:04:45.210> I've<00:04:45.419> never<00:04:45.570> rent

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
you know landed smoothly I've never rent

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.260 
you know landed smoothly I've never rent
landed<00:04:46.260> raw<00:04:46.440> for<00:04:46.710> flipped<00:04:46.950> or<00:04:47.070> anything<00:04:47.340> so

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
landed raw for flipped or anything so

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.000 
landed raw for flipped or anything so
you<00:04:48.330> know<00:04:48.780> the<00:04:48.990> rest<00:04:49.230> of<00:04:49.440> the<00:04:49.500> map<00:04:49.650> is<00:04:49.770> a<00:04:49.830> great

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
you know the rest of the map is a great

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:51.680 
you know the rest of the map is a great
map<00:04:50.190> and<00:04:50.430> it's<00:04:50.850> you<00:04:51.000> know<00:04:51.060> it's<00:04:51.120> pretty<00:04:51.390> fun<00:04:51.570> to

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
map and it's you know it's pretty fun to

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:52.730 
map and it's you know it's pretty fun to
race<00:04:51.810> with<00:04:51.900> your<00:04:52.020> friends<00:04:52.320> the<00:04:52.530> only<00:04:52.620> problem

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
race with your friends the only problem

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.610 
race with your friends the only problem
again<00:04:53.220> was<00:04:53.370> just<00:04:53.400> that<00:04:53.700> first<00:04:53.910> turn<00:04:54.240> and<00:04:55.140> it

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
again was just that first turn and it

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.440 
again was just that first turn and it
really<00:04:55.800> wasn't<00:04:55.950> that<00:04:56.490> the<00:04:56.940> term<00:04:57.150> was<00:04:57.330> too

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.450 
really wasn't that the term was too

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:58.640 
really wasn't that the term was too
challenging<00:04:57.690> because<00:04:58.200> there's<00:04:58.440> nothing

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
challenging because there's nothing

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.320 
challenging because there's nothing
wrong<00:04:58.770> with<00:04:58.830> that<00:04:59.010> it<00:04:59.190> was<00:04:59.280> just<00:04:59.430> the<00:04:59.640> if<00:05:00.210> you

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
wrong with that it was just the if you

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.570 
wrong with that it was just the if you
fell<00:05:00.630> off<00:05:00.810> if<00:05:01.110> you<00:05:01.200> fell<00:05:01.410> off<00:05:01.440> the<00:05:01.710> turn<00:05:01.919> that

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
fell off if you fell off the turn that

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.940 
fell off if you fell off the turn that
the<00:05:03.030> spawning<00:05:03.360> where<00:05:04.080> you<00:05:04.200> spawn<00:05:04.440> dad<00:05:04.770> was

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:04.950 
the spawning where you spawn dad was

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:07.460 
the spawning where you spawn dad was
just<00:05:05.190> a<00:05:05.280> little<00:05:05.520> bit<00:05:06.080> you<00:05:07.080> know<00:05:07.110> should<00:05:07.410> have

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
just a little bit you know should have

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.860 
just a little bit you know should have
been<00:05:07.680> we<00:05:08.220> spawn<00:05:08.520> but<00:05:08.850> that's<00:05:09.090> see<00:05:09.480> you<00:05:09.600> can<00:05:09.720> see

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
been we spawn but that's see you can see

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.420 
been we spawn but that's see you can see
right<00:05:09.900> there<00:05:10.110> the<00:05:10.140> checkpoint<00:05:10.620> is<00:05:10.740> but<00:05:11.010> again

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
right there the checkpoint is but again

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:12.750 
right there the checkpoint is but again
it's<00:05:11.610> okay<00:05:11.850> it's<00:05:12.000> not<00:05:12.120> a<00:05:12.180> big<00:05:12.330> deal

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:12.760 
it's okay it's not a big deal

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.640 
it's okay it's not a big deal
you<00:05:13.600> know<00:05:13.720> you<00:05:13.810> can<00:05:13.930> fix<00:05:14.020> it<00:05:14.200> your<00:05:14.320> next<00:05:14.500> map
