00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
Chris with high power cycles and this is

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.410 
Chris with high power cycles and this is
our<00:00:02.939> 67<00:00:03.750> volt<00:00:04.100> electric<00:00:05.100> lithium<00:00:05.730> full

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
our 67 volt electric lithium full

our 67 volt electric lithium full
suspension<00:00:06.600> mountain<00:00:06.990> bike<00:00:07.259> and<00:00:07.680> as<00:00:08.460> you<00:00:08.550> can

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
suspension mountain bike and as you can

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.450 
suspension mountain bike and as you can
see<00:00:08.730> this<00:00:09.090> is<00:00:09.269> really<00:00:09.540> lightweight<00:00:10.460> total

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
see this is really lightweight total

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.509 
see this is really lightweight total
weight<00:00:11.580> is<00:00:11.880> right<00:00:12.269> around<00:00:12.360> 50<00:00:12.630> pounds<00:00:13.170> or<00:00:13.320> so

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:13.519 
weight is right around 50 pounds or so

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:16.310 
weight is right around 50 pounds or so
the<00:00:14.519> battery<00:00:14.820> system<00:00:15.240> is<00:00:15.389> 57<00:00:15.960> volts<00:00:16.230> or

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
the battery system is 57 volts or

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.230 
the battery system is 57 volts or
lithium<00:00:16.500> polymer<00:00:16.800> 8am<00:00:17.460> powers<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:17.970> get<00:00:18.090> you

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
lithium polymer 8am powers to get you

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.720 
lithium polymer 8am powers to get you
about<00:00:18.390> 25<00:00:18.869> to<00:00:19.020> 30<00:00:19.170> miles<00:00:19.439> of<00:00:19.619> range<00:00:19.830> when<00:00:20.100> it's

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
about 25 to 30 miles of range when it's

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.599 
about 25 to 30 miles of range when it's
motor<00:00:21.740> the<00:00:22.740> battery<00:00:23.039> is<00:00:23.100> only<00:00:23.310> weighs<00:00:23.580> 7

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
motor the battery is only weighs 7

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.970 
motor the battery is only weighs 7
pounds<00:00:24.000> total<00:00:24.510> so<00:00:25.019> it's<00:00:25.289> really<00:00:25.560> really

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
pounds total so it's really really

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.060 
pounds total so it's really really

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
are going to be brushed this with no

are going to be brushed this with no
gears<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.250> it's<00:00:56.370> going<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.550> bigger<00:00:56.760> both

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
gears and it's going to bigger both

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.099 
gears and it's going to bigger both
going<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.210> have<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.329> lot<00:00:57.510> of<00:00:57.539> torque<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:57.989> lot

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
going to have a lot of torque and a lot

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.680 
going to have a lot of torque and a lot
of<00:00:58.170> power<00:00:58.350> I<00:00:58.820> should<00:00:59.820> be<00:00:59.940> having<00:01:00.239> some<00:01:00.420> videos

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
of power I should be having some videos

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.160 
of power I should be having some videos
of<00:01:00.840> those<00:01:01.109> in<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.649> next<00:01:01.920> couple<00:01:02.039> weeks<00:01:02.539> but<00:01:03.539> I

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
of those in the next couple weeks but I

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.170 
of those in the next couple weeks but I
just<00:01:04.799> think<00:01:04.949> this<00:01:05.339> is<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.640> top<00:01:05.790> speed<00:01:06.030> on<00:01:06.119> this

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
just think this is the top speed on this

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.960 
just think this is the top speed on this
is<00:01:06.979> 36<00:01:07.979> miles<00:01:08.189> per<00:01:08.369> hour<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.700> we<00:01:08.760> verified

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
is 36 miles per hour and we verified

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.530 
is 36 miles per hour and we verified
that<00:01:09.180> yesterday<00:01:09.689> on<00:01:09.840> GPS<00:01:11.240> there's<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.299> lot<00:01:12.390> of

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
that yesterday on GPS there's a lot of

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.660 
that yesterday on GPS there's a lot of
torque<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:13.020> lot<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.229> power<00:01:13.439> three<00:01:14.430> wheels

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
torque a lot of power three wheels

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.789 
torque a lot of power three wheels
completely<00:01:14.850> so<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:16.170> don't<00:01:16.409> feel<00:01:16.560> like<00:01:16.710> the

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
completely so you don't feel like the

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.289 
completely so you don't feel like the
motors<00:01:17.040> there<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:17.369> can<00:01:17.490> settle<00:01:17.850> without<00:01:18.000> it

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
motors there you can settle without it

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.030 
motors there you can settle without it
we<00:01:18.630> have<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.810> quick-release<00:01:19.170> battery<00:01:19.650> system

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
we have a quick-release battery system

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.380 
we have a quick-release battery system
that<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:20.280> just<00:01:20.430> press<00:01:20.640> this<00:01:20.790> button<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.180> the

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
that you just press this button and the

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.800 
that you just press this button and the
battery<00:01:21.689> slide<00:01:21.900> right<00:01:22.110> off<00:01:23.240> today<00:01:24.240> item<00:01:24.570> to

battery slide right off today item to
give<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.080> little<00:01:25.140> demonstration<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:25.979> the

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
give you a little demonstration of the

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.670 
give you a little demonstration of the
torque<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.549> has<00:01:26.700> right<00:01:27.570> here<00:01:28.009> from<00:01:29.009> this

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
torque it has right here from this

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.289 
torque it has right here from this
we<00:01:31.680> start<00:01:32.100> an<00:01:32.189> elevation<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:33.829> 1348<00:01:34.829> feet<00:01:35.299> and

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
we start an elevation of 1348 feet and

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.029 
we start an elevation of 1348 feet and
we're<00:01:36.990> going<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.140> be<00:01:37.229> going<00:01:37.380> up<00:01:37.619> that<00:01:37.770> hill

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:38.039 
we're going to be going up that hill

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:40.429 
we're going to be going up that hill
right<00:01:38.969> over<00:01:39.179> there<00:01:39.329> which<00:01:39.719> has<00:01:40.049> an<00:01:40.229> ending

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
right over there which has an ending

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.950 
right over there which has an ending
elevation<00:01:40.950> of<00:01:41.070> fourteen<00:01:42.060> hundred<00:01:42.179> and<00:01:42.600> forty

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
elevation of fourteen hundred and forty

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.020 
elevation of fourteen hundred and forty
eight<00:01:43.049> feet<00:01:43.259> so<00:01:43.560> there<00:01:44.009> is<00:01:44.100> an<00:01:44.219> elevation<00:01:44.759> rise

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
eight feet so there is an elevation rise

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.139 
eight feet so there is an elevation rise
of<00:01:45.390> 100<00:01:46.110> feet<00:01:46.319> and<00:01:46.530> the<00:01:47.490> distance<00:01:47.850> from<00:01:47.970> here

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
of 100 feet and the distance from here

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.969 
of 100 feet and the distance from here
the<00:01:48.299> top<00:01:48.450> of<00:01:48.569> the<00:01:48.630> hill<00:01:48.750> is<00:01:48.899> 930<00:01:49.470> feet<00:01:49.710> so

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
the top of the hill is 930 feet so

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.419 
the top of the hill is 930 feet so
there's<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.340> rise<00:01:50.569> 108<00:01:51.569> feet<00:01:51.840> in<00:01:52.189> 930<00:01:53.189> feet

00:01:53.419 --> 00:01:53.429 
there's a rise 108 feet in 930 feet
