00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:03.200
 the park to win 

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.279
 many suburbs 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:06.300
 lunching 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.719
 the south of the river 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:10.810
 Only today he talked to who about himself. 

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:12.809
 The decree reduces activity 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:13.940
 we are coming back 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:15.679
 I came to watch 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:18.679
 the people 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.960
 the central question 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.079
 another thing I know how to do 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:27.630
 the leaves on Thursday and Friday 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.439
 it's been 23 years 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:31.589
 the crossing 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:34.240
 already have experience 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.240
 a delicate issue that you like the failure that one eats cold 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.090
 What can be done more 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.990
 jaden smith was the basket 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.990
 this episode is important 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.060
 It's college staff we already have. 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.900
 few days before the beginning of the work done 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.900
 so we need him 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.760
 excellent happy father to have another opportunity executive power mayor 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.030
 amaranth gonÃ§alo 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.490
 be a match 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.090
 I can now bluish 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.830
 a complete right judgment 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.830
 This is unacceptable 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.600
 so take the test 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.600
 he has an order is singular to do 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.900
 as well as having a clear definition of the compounds 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.010
 I think this ends up being relevant 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.090
 starting with the writing 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.090
 then you pass 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.170
 do not forget about it 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.110
 it is necessary 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.110
 sr on April 2 anders area 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.100
 submitted where it was not ready 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.500
 I think it's a change 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.500
 What's missing at school? 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:10.719
 discursive 

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:13.719
 I finished doing 

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:18.959
 it's a shame that evil 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.489
 the sachets with football 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.479
 and is greatly appreciated 

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:25.450
 the big bet 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.210
 its worst level in which it was more in front of the crisis 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:34.099
 sources close to the issue of human 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:34.989
 but four 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.199
 on April 2 both on the morning shift 

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:39.779
 other attacks 

00:02:39.779 --> 00:02:42.719
 so put on a podium here we're aggressive 

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:45.499
 have to have options accessible to new employees
