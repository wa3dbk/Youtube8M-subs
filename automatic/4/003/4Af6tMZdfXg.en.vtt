working with stands vertically on the
jig<00:00:29.580> and<00:00:29.820> I'll<00:00:30.240> start<00:00:30.510> by<00:00:30.689> positioning<00:00:30.869> that

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
jig and I'll start by positioning that

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.160 
jig and I'll start by positioning that
sideways<00:00:31.920> just<00:00:32.820> by<00:00:32.969> eye<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.210> get<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.750> layout

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
sideways just by eye to get the layout

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.979 
sideways just by eye to get the layout
that<00:00:34.410> I<00:00:34.469> want<00:00:34.800> so<00:00:35.730> it's<00:00:35.880> about<00:00:36.030> evenly<00:00:36.540> spaced

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
that I want so it's about evenly spaced

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.780 
that I want so it's about evenly spaced
across<00:00:37.739> some<00:00:37.980> of<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.190> fingers<00:00:38.550> on<00:00:38.700> the

across some of the fingers on the

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.150 
across some of the fingers on the
template<00:00:39.239> once<00:00:40.230> I've<00:00:40.379> decided<00:00:40.710> on<00:00:40.950> that

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
template once I've decided on that

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.400 
template once I've decided on that
position<00:00:41.460> these<00:00:42.329> sliding<00:00:42.629> stops<00:00:43.079> are<00:00:43.290> up

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
position these sliding stops are up

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.250 
position these sliding stops are up
against<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.860> edge<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.399> locked<00:00:44.640> in<00:00:44.850> place

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.200 

and<00:00:48.950> I<00:00:49.010> started<00:00:49.340> by<00:00:49.460> clamping<00:00:49.730> the<00:00:50.030> work

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
and I started by clamping the work

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:56.900 
and I started by clamping the work
securely<00:00:51.079> to<00:00:51.320> the<00:00:51.350> G

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.180 

first<00:00:57.570> off<00:00:57.810> I'm<00:00:57.989> fitting<00:00:58.290> a<00:00:58.410> dovetail<00:00:58.680> cutter

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
first off I'm fitting a dovetail cutter

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.950 
first off I'm fitting a dovetail cutter
to<00:00:59.400> the<00:00:59.489> router<00:00:59.730> and<00:01:00.090> there's<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.450> bearing<00:01:00.870> on

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.840 
to the router and there's a bearing on
the<00:01:01.110> shank<00:01:01.290> of<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.560> bit<00:01:01.770> that<00:01:02.370> bearing<00:01:02.820> is

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
the shank of the bit that bearing is

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.910 
the shank of the bit that bearing is
going<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.239> run<00:01:03.390> against<00:01:03.720> that<00:01:03.960> template<00:01:04.440> on

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
going to run against that template on

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.680 
going to run against that template on
the<00:01:05.100> bottom<00:01:05.370> of<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.580> jig<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:06.270> that's<00:01:06.479> going

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 
the bottom of the jig and that's going

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:15.230 
the bottom of the jig and that's going
to<00:01:06.780> guide<00:01:07.080> where<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.770> cutter<00:01:07.979> can<00:01:08.190> go<00:01:14.240> setting

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
to guide where the cutter can go setting

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.210 
to guide where the cutter can go setting
the<00:01:15.330> height<00:01:15.540> of<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.900> cutter<00:01:16.140> one<00:01:16.830> of<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.070> nice

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
the height of the cutter one of the nice

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.859 
the height of the cutter one of the nice
things<00:01:17.250> with<00:01:17.729> this<00:01:17.880> jig<00:01:18.150> is<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.479> don't<00:01:18.720> have

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
things with this jig is you don't have

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.600 
things with this jig is you don't have
to<00:01:19.020> set<00:01:19.200> that<00:01:19.350> height<00:01:19.590> accurately<00:01:20.250> unlike<00:01:20.580> a

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
to set that height accurately unlike a

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.760 
to set that height accurately unlike a
lot<00:01:20.820> of<00:01:20.850> other<00:01:21.000> dovetail<00:01:21.479> jigs<00:01:21.840> so<00:01:22.500> what<00:01:22.650> I'm

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
lot of other dovetail jigs so what I'm

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.310 
lot of other dovetail jigs so what I'm
going<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.070> do<00:01:23.280> is<00:01:23.729> raise<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.090> cutter<00:01:24.509> up<00:01:24.780> till

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
going to do is raise the cutter up till

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.020 
going to do is raise the cutter up till
it's<00:01:25.470> about<00:01:25.710> level<00:01:26.190> with<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.460> thickness<00:01:26.910> of

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
it's about level with the thickness of

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.570 
it's about level with the thickness of
the<00:01:27.180> timber<00:01:27.600> above<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.080> template<00:01:28.560> it<00:01:29.250> doesn't

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
the timber above the template it doesn't

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.790 
the timber above the template it doesn't
hurt<00:01:29.759> it's<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.119> little<00:01:30.360> bit<00:01:30.479> higher<00:01:30.720> just<00:01:31.110> means

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:31.800 
hurt it's a little bit higher just means

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.440 
hurt it's a little bit higher just means
the<00:01:31.979> joint<00:01:32.160> sits<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.580> little<00:01:32.700> bit<00:01:32.850> proud<00:01:33.180> on<00:01:33.360> the

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
the joint sits a little bit proud on the

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.420 
the joint sits a little bit proud on the
corner<00:01:33.899> you<00:01:34.320> get<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.500> good<00:01:34.649> fitting<00:01:35.009> joint

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
corner you get a good fitting joint

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:44.820 
corner you get a good fitting joint
either<00:01:35.610> way<00:01:36.800> so<00:01:37.800> raising<00:01:38.250> that<00:01:38.369> cutter<00:01:38.700> up

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.230 

so<00:01:45.340> I<00:01:45.370> can<00:01:45.610> just<00:01:45.790> fill<00:01:46.000> the<00:01:46.210> top<00:01:48.090> locking<00:01:49.090> that

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
so I can just fill the top locking that

00:01:49.240 --> 00:02:11.520 
so I can just fill the top locking that
in<00:01:49.450> place

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:28.930 

you

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.280 

that's<00:02:29.940> the<00:02:30.090> first<00:02:30.300> half<00:02:30.630> of<00:02:30.810> one<00:02:31.020> joint

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
that's the first half of one joint

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.920 
that's the first half of one joint
finished<00:02:31.740> if<00:02:32.730> we<00:02:32.910> were<00:02:33.000> doing<00:02:33.300> a<00:02:33.390> box<00:02:33.630> we'd

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
finished if we were doing a box we'd

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.930 
finished if we were doing a box we'd
simply<00:02:34.320> turn<00:02:34.560> that<00:02:34.710> in<00:02:34.890> four<00:02:35.100> ends<00:02:35.490> to<00:02:35.670> do<00:02:35.790> the

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
simply turn that in four ends to do the

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.240 
simply turn that in four ends to do the
dovetail<00:02:36.660> slots<00:02:36.990> there<00:02:37.260> and<00:02:37.860> we<00:02:37.950> do<00:02:38.100> exactly

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
dovetail slots there and we do exactly

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.150 
dovetail slots there and we do exactly
the<00:02:38.700> same<00:02:38.880> on<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.180> opposite<00:02:39.600> side<00:02:40.010> once<00:02:41.010> we've

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
the same on the opposite side once we've

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.830 
the same on the opposite side once we've
got<00:02:41.340> all<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.640> dovetail<00:02:42.030> slots<00:02:42.330> finished<00:02:42.690> for

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
got all the dovetail slots finished for

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.810 
got all the dovetail slots finished for
the<00:02:42.900> project<00:02:43.410> then<00:02:44.130> we<00:02:44.220> come<00:02:44.430> around<00:02:44.520> to<00:02:44.670> the

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
the project then we come around to the

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.790 
the project then we come around to the
other<00:02:44.850> side<00:02:45.060> of<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:45.660> jig<00:02:45.960> which<00:02:46.620> has

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
other side of the jig which has

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.360 
other side of the jig which has
different<00:02:47.190> shaped<00:02:47.400> fingers<00:02:47.790> on<00:02:47.940> the<00:02:48.030> template

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
different shaped fingers on the template

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.480 
different shaped fingers on the template
between<00:02:50.370> those<00:02:50.580> two<00:02:50.850> stops<00:02:52.010> and<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.100> function

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
between those two stops and the function

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.340 
between those two stops and the function
of<00:02:53.580> those<00:02:53.700> stops<00:02:54.060> is<00:02:54.270> to<00:02:54.420> align<00:02:54.630> the<00:02:54.870> edges<00:02:55.050> of

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
of those stops is to align the edges of

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.410 
of those stops is to align the edges of
the<00:02:55.440> boards<00:02:55.830> so<00:02:56.340> there's<00:02:56.490> no<00:02:56.610> marking<00:02:57.060> out<00:02:57.240> or

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
the boards so there's no marking out or

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.730 
the boards so there's no marking out or
measuring<00:02:57.870> required<00:02:59.720> in<00:03:00.720> clamping<00:03:01.320> securely

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
measuring required in clamping securely

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.700 
measuring required in clamping securely
in<00:03:01.920> place<00:03:03.560> now<00:03:04.560> I'm<00:03:04.680> changing<00:03:04.950> over<00:03:05.540> to<00:03:06.540> a

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:06.710 
in place now I'm changing over to a

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:14.510 
in place now I'm changing over to a
straight<00:03:07.710> cutter<00:03:08.040> in<00:03:08.280> the<00:03:08.400> router<00:03:13.160> once<00:03:14.160> again

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
straight cutter in the router once again

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.040 
straight cutter in the router once again
there's<00:03:14.790> a<00:03:14.820> bearing<00:03:15.240> on<00:03:15.360> the<00:03:15.540> shank<00:03:15.750> of<00:03:15.930> the

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
there's a bearing on the shank of the

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.810 
there's a bearing on the shank of the
cutter<00:03:16.260> to<00:03:16.560> run<00:03:16.710> against<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:17.130> template<00:03:17.670> on

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
cutter to run against the template on

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:23.780 
cutter to run against the template on
the<00:03:17.970> jig<00:03:21.590> and<00:03:22.590> once<00:03:22.800> again<00:03:22.950> we're<00:03:23.400> setting<00:03:23.700> a

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
the jig and once again we're setting a

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.090 
the jig and once again we're setting a
height<00:03:24.110> level<00:03:25.110> with<00:03:25.440> the<00:03:25.560> thickness<00:03:25.890> of<00:03:26.010> the

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
height level with the thickness of the

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.830 
height level with the thickness of the
timber<00:03:26.520> and<00:03:26.670> again<00:03:27.000> it<00:03:27.120> doesn't<00:03:27.330> hurt<00:03:27.540> if<00:03:27.720> it's

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
timber and again it doesn't hurt if it's

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.750 
timber and again it doesn't hurt if it's
a<00:03:27.930> little<00:03:28.140> bit<00:03:28.260> higher<00:03:28.470> and<00:03:29.160> it<00:03:29.280> doesn't<00:03:29.640> have

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
a little bit higher and it doesn't have

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.460 
a little bit higher and it doesn't have
to<00:03:29.910> be<00:03:30.000> exactly<00:03:30.390> the<00:03:30.570> same<00:03:30.600> height<00:03:31.080> as<00:03:31.320> that

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
to be exactly the same height as that

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.390 
to be exactly the same height as that
first<00:03:31.680> cutter<00:03:33.410> get<00:03:34.410> a<00:03:34.440> good<00:03:34.650> fitting<00:03:34.980> joint

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
first cutter get a good fitting joint

00:03:35.400 --> 00:04:20.259 
first cutter get a good fitting joint
either<00:03:35.670> way

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.910 

that's<00:04:21.269> the<00:04:21.420> joint<00:04:21.660> finished<00:04:22.109> now<00:04:22.650> cutting

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:22.920 
that's the joint finished now cutting

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.960 
that's the joint finished now cutting
time<00:04:23.220> was<00:04:23.430> only<00:04:23.640> about<00:04:23.730> 30<00:04:24.120> seconds<00:04:24.750> and<00:04:25.970> there

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
time was only about 30 seconds and there

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.670 
time was only about 30 seconds and there
we've<00:04:27.300> got<00:04:27.390> a<00:04:27.540> perfect<00:04:27.990> fitting<00:04:28.200> dovetail

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
we've got a perfect fitting dovetail

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.770 
we've got a perfect fitting dovetail
joint<00:04:29.040> and<00:04:29.250> you'll<00:04:29.730> get<00:04:29.850> exactly<00:04:30.270> that<00:04:30.360> same

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
joint and you'll get exactly that same

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.950 
joint and you'll get exactly that same
result<00:04:31.020> every<00:04:31.800> time<00:04:31.830> you<00:04:32.160> use<00:04:32.340> the<00:04:32.520> jig<00:04:32.960> the

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
result every time you use the jig the

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.780 
result every time you use the jig the
first<00:04:34.230> time<00:04:34.530> you<00:04:34.740> use<00:04:34.950> the<00:04:35.160> jig<00:04:35.370> you<00:04:35.520> have<00:04:35.640> to

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
first time you use the jig you have to

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.420 
first time you use the jig you have to
do<00:04:35.910> a<00:04:35.940> trial<00:04:36.270> joint<00:04:36.720> to<00:04:37.290> adjust<00:04:37.620> how<00:04:37.950> tight<00:04:38.250> or

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
do a trial joint to adjust how tight or

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.700 
do a trial joint to adjust how tight or
loose<00:04:38.460> that<00:04:38.940> fit<00:04:39.180> is<00:04:39.390> but<00:04:40.140> once<00:04:40.350> you've<00:04:40.500> set

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
loose that fit is but once you've set

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.230 
loose that fit is but once you've set
the<00:04:40.860> jig<00:04:41.070> to<00:04:41.400> match<00:04:41.550> the<00:04:41.730> pair<00:04:41.910> of<00:04:41.940> cutters

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
the jig to match the pair of cutters

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.240 
the jig to match the pair of cutters
that<00:04:43.140> as<00:04:43.230> long<00:04:43.410> as<00:04:43.530> you<00:04:43.620> use<00:04:43.800> those<00:04:43.980> same

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
that as long as you use those same

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.010 
that as long as you use those same
cutters<00:04:44.670> all<00:04:44.820> the<00:04:44.940> time<00:04:45.150> you'll<00:04:45.750> get<00:04:45.870> exactly

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
cutters all the time you'll get exactly

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.530 
cutters all the time you'll get exactly
that<00:04:46.380> same<00:04:46.770> fit<00:04:47.070> every<00:04:47.400> time<00:04:47.640> no<00:04:48.240> matter<00:04:48.300> what

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540
