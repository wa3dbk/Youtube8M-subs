really<00:02:22.260> good<00:02:22.440> if<00:02:22.560> you<00:02:22.680> have<00:02:22.860> your<00:02:23.010> Super

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
really good if you have your Super

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.370 
really good if you have your Super
Nintendo<00:02:23.490> in<00:02:24.060> front<00:02:24.420> of<00:02:24.569> you<00:02:24.750> sitting<00:02:25.110> next<00:02:25.230> to

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
Nintendo in front of you sitting next to

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.650 
Nintendo in front of you sitting next to
the<00:02:25.500> TV<00:02:25.710> 10<00:02:26.160> or<00:02:26.280> 15<00:02:26.640> feet<00:02:26.670> away<00:02:27.000> this

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
the TV 10 or 15 feet away this

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.449 
the TV 10 or 15 feet away this
eliminates<00:02:28.170> a<00:02:28.290> lot<00:02:28.319> of<00:02:28.500> wire<00:02:28.830> clutter<00:02:29.190> and

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
eliminates a lot of wire clutter and

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.369 
eliminates a lot of wire clutter and
it's<00:02:29.730> a<00:02:29.819> very<00:02:30.030> comfortable<00:02:30.269> controller<00:02:31.110> to

it's a very comfortable controller to

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:33.110 
it's a very comfortable controller to
use<00:02:31.530> even<00:02:31.830> if<00:02:32.040> this<00:02:32.220> thing<00:02:32.400> had<00:02:32.610> a<00:02:32.640> wire<00:02:32.879> it

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
use even if this thing had a wire it

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.520 
use even if this thing had a wire it
would<00:02:33.239> be

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
would be

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.650 
would be
nice<00:02:33.680> controller<00:02:34.280> as<00:02:34.520> the<00:02:34.850> name<00:02:35.030> suggests<00:02:35.209> it

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
nice controller as the name suggests it
