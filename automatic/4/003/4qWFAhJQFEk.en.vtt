00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
early 2000s and I just find that it

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.260 
early 2000s and I just find that it
works<00:03:47.110> and<00:03:47.530> once<00:03:48.190> I<00:03:48.340> find<00:03:48.610> the<00:03:48.730> pet<00:03:48.970> once<00:03:49.150> I

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:49.270 
works and once I find the pet once I

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:51.180 
works and once I find the pet once I
found<00:03:49.450> the<00:03:49.600> palette<00:03:49.960> that<00:03:50.080> works<00:03:50.320> for<00:03:50.470> me<00:03:50.620> once

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
found the palette that works for me once

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.640 
found the palette that works for me once
I<00:03:51.310> found<00:03:51.520> paint<00:03:51.880> that<00:03:52.090> works<00:03:52.270> for<00:03:52.450> me<00:03:52.600> once<00:03:53.590> I

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
I found paint that works for me once I

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.740 
I found paint that works for me once I
find<00:03:53.890> brushes<00:03:54.280> that<00:03:54.400> work<00:03:54.610> for<00:03:54.820> me<00:03:54.940> I<00:03:55.150> tend<00:03:55.630> to

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
find brushes that work for me I tend to

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:02.220 
find brushes that work for me I tend to
keep<00:03:56.320> using<00:03:56.650> those<00:03:56.980> things<00:03:57.600> because<00:04:01.230> there's

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
keep using those things because there's

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.410 
keep using those things because there's
enough<00:04:02.650> to<00:04:02.890> worry<00:04:03.100> about<00:04:03.250> with<00:04:03.880> just<00:04:04.030> drawing

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
enough to worry about with just drawing

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:09.500 
enough to worry about with just drawing
and<00:04:04.720> mixing<00:04:04.990> colors<00:04:06.270> without<00:04:07.270> having<00:04:07.900> to

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
and mixing colors without having to

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.030 
and mixing colors without having to
without<00:04:10.510> having<00:04:10.540> to<00:04:10.930> always<00:04:11.910> you<00:04:12.910> know<00:04:13.030> we

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
without having to always you know we

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.289 
without having to always you know we
rethink<00:04:15.040> you<00:04:15.280> know<00:04:15.400> what<00:04:15.760> you're<00:04:15.970> painting

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
rethink you know what you're painting

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.060 
rethink you know what you're painting
with<00:04:16.330> and<00:04:16.840> what<00:04:16.959> colors<00:04:17.320> you're<00:04:17.470> using<00:04:17.500> and

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
with and what colors you're using and

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.760 
with and what colors you're using and
you<00:04:18.790> know<00:04:18.880> I<00:04:18.910> try<00:04:19.209> to<00:04:19.239> minimize<00:04:19.570> my<00:04:20.109> variables

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:20.770 
you know I try to minimize my variables

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:49.570 
you know I try to minimize my variables
if<00:04:21.700> that<00:04:22.210> makes<00:04:22.420> sense

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.680 

the<00:04:50.569> way<00:04:50.720> I<00:04:50.780> tend<00:04:51.110> to<00:04:51.169> paint<00:04:51.470> I<00:04:52.300> get<00:04:53.300> a<00:04:53.330> pretty

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
the way I tend to paint I get a pretty

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.830 
the way I tend to paint I get a pretty
good<00:04:53.900> drum<00:04:54.050> and<00:04:54.259> not<00:04:54.349> a<00:04:54.379> perfect<00:04:55.099> drawing<00:04:55.840> and

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
good drum and not a perfect drawing and

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.800 
good drum and not a perfect drawing and
I<00:04:56.990> kind<00:04:57.289> of<00:04:57.379> tend<00:04:57.620> to<00:04:58.180> draw<00:04:59.180> the<00:04:59.240> whole<00:04:59.569> time

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
I kind of tend to draw the whole time

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.080 
I kind of tend to draw the whole time
I'm<00:05:00.020> painting<00:05:00.289> and<00:05:00.590> so<00:05:00.770> like<00:05:00.979> it<00:05:01.099> ends<00:05:01.370> up<00:05:01.460> kind

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
I'm painting and so like it ends up kind

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.360 
I'm painting and so like it ends up kind
of<00:05:02.180> in<00:05:02.270> a<00:05:02.360> wide<00:05:02.629> circle<00:05:03.080> and<00:05:03.560> then<00:05:03.710> it<00:05:03.740> comes<00:05:04.069> in

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
of in a wide circle and then it comes in

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:06.159 
of in a wide circle and then it comes in
and<00:05:04.580> in<00:05:04.699> and<00:05:04.879> in<00:05:04.970> and<00:05:05.180> in<00:05:05.300> and<00:05:05.419> then<00:05:05.569> and<00:05:05.900> at<00:05:06.020> the

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:06.169 
and in and in and in and then and at the

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:08.529 
and in and in and in and then and at the
end<00:05:06.550> hopefully<00:05:07.550> we're<00:05:08.000> hitting<00:05:08.240> the<00:05:08.330> bull's

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:08.539 
end hopefully we're hitting the bull's

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:33.620 
end hopefully we're hitting the bull's

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.710 
to myself a lot of times I try to kind

of talk my way through what I'm doing

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.990 
of talk my way through what I'm doing
that<00:05:47.680> way<00:05:47.890> you<00:05:47.950> know<00:05:48.250> sometimes<00:05:48.670> if<00:05:48.760> you<00:05:48.850> can

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 
that way you know sometimes if you can

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.690 
that way you know sometimes if you can
hear<00:05:49.360> it<00:05:49.740> you<00:05:50.740> have<00:05:50.860> a<00:05:50.920> better<00:05:51.160> chance<00:05:51.490> of

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:51.700 
hear it you have a better chance of

hear it you have a better chance of
doing<00:05:51.760> it

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:11.700 

I<00:06:08.169> tried<00:06:09.169> to<00:06:09.380> set<00:06:10.100> myself<00:06:10.280> up<00:06:10.790> in<00:06:10.940> a<00:06:11.000> position

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:11.710 
I tried to set myself up in a position

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:16.990 
I tried to set myself up in a position
where<00:06:12.710> I<00:06:14.139> have<00:06:15.139> my<00:06:15.320> palette<00:06:15.710> in<00:06:15.830> my<00:06:15.950> easel<00:06:16.310> my

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:17.000 
where I have my palette in my easel my

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.520 
where I have my palette in my easel my
palette<00:06:17.330> kind<00:06:17.570> of<00:06:17.630> in<00:06:17.720> front<00:06:17.840> of<00:06:18.020> my<00:06:18.110> easel<00:06:18.410> so

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:18.530 
palette kind of in front of my easel so

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:21.070 
palette kind of in front of my easel so
that<00:06:18.710> I<00:06:18.740> don't<00:06:18.860> get<00:06:18.950> too<00:06:19.100> close<00:06:19.370> and<00:06:19.700> the<00:06:20.600> model

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.080 
that I don't get too close and the model

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.480 
that I don't get too close and the model
is<00:06:21.169> someplace<00:06:21.650> where<00:06:21.860> all<00:06:21.980> I<00:06:22.010> have<00:06:22.220> to<00:06:22.310> do<00:06:22.460> I

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:22.490 
is someplace where all I have to do I

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:23.710 
is someplace where all I have to do I
could<00:06:22.760> pretty<00:06:22.970> much<00:06:23.120> stand<00:06:23.360> in<00:06:23.450> the<00:06:23.510> same

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:23.720 
could pretty much stand in the same

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.650 
could pretty much stand in the same
