00:00:08.979 --> 00:00:11.179
 all the fire on the roof today we would not 

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:13.729
 no money gn even 

00:00:13.729 --> 00:00:15.489
 I have a score 

00:00:15.489 --> 00:00:18.489
 weekly pause and due to the fact that 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:25.169
 sit down so I 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:30.579
 and nobody wanted 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.980
 today I want to thank 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.950
 migration to treatment 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.730
 so what exactly do I mean 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.860
 Armenians ask him 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.860
 such a typical question as far as I am 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.600
 1 UK is not alone of all emigration 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.600
 this plan offensive 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.990
 migrated 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.990
 family or pessimists 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.720
 but it's like if I remembered 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.720
 all sorts of different questions 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.960
 having children and family 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.660
 stereotype that 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.480
 I want to start with 

00:02:36.279 --> 00:02:39.279
 almost inevitable 

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:11.289
 metalhead list 

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:19.199
 presence of 74 tracks Omsk 

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:27.989
 eyes of the media 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.019
 in general, what does it give 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:32.269
 intervene 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:35.269
 do you have them money 

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:44.229
 team interested 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:48.289
 bottom plan 

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:49.869
 he will arrive at the cathedral 

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:51.479
 young 

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:52.959
 Canadians who 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:54.879
 though not 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:57.709
 fired essentially rhetoric but 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:59.699
 here's an eyewitness less 

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:00.579
 with high probability 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:03.439
 will accept Canadian value 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:06.439
 with Canadians 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:11.519
 you bring death 

00:04:14.249 --> 00:04:17.249
 it is not clear with you 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:22.910
 one hundred percent integrates into 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.069
 local 

00:04:24.069 --> 00:04:26.999
 one hundred percent 

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:29.999
 do something useful further 

00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:33.900
 so 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.090
 having children will give you a plus for 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.809
 inflation 

00:04:37.809 --> 00:04:40.809
 for those people 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.840
 children are 

00:04:48.809 --> 00:04:51.809
 what if obama 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.400
 education 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.059
 children big score 

00:04:59.059 --> 00:05:00.449
 wait if you have there 

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:02.110
 2 3 regnum 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.110
 but could not become 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:08.639
 sick shares say so from September 30 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.370
 which will allow you 

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:15.800
 im as earthly it looked want 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.339
 to tell that 

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:18.740
 do not be afraid 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.289
 to emigrate if one point 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:24.240
 presence or absence 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:27.240
 is an obstacle 

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:31.249
 help them 

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:36.759
 judge 

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:47.009
 in turn will give 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.020
 and cover your 

00:06:02.129 --> 00:06:05.129
 turn 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.080
 stupid priests after all 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.669
 have sergey kunitsyn 

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:22.669
 for emigration 

00:06:23.339 --> 00:06:24.159
 all my friends
