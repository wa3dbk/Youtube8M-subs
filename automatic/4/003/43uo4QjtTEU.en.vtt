 1. Making caramel liquid 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:18.700
 Cold boiled water and fine sugar poured into the pot 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.580
 Gently shake to mix the sugar and cold water evenly 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:35.960
 Open medium and small fire boiled sugar 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:16.200
 Boil until the beginning of the brown color (note that the fire is not too big) 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:45.280
 Boil the dark brown to make a big bubble, pour the hot water 15cc into it and shake it evenly to turn off the fire. 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:54.900
 Pour the caramel liquid into the container on average, so that the bottom of the cup evenly forms a layer of caramel liquid. 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.980
 2. Making milk egg liquid 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:16.720

 Add vanilla wine and mix evenly 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:51.000
 Fresh milk, fine sugar and whipped cream are heated in a pan 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:57.520
 Cook to the side of the pot and the small bubble will turn off the fire. 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:18.720
 Slowly add the milk to the egg mixture while stirring. 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:38.400
 Stir the evenly mixed egg milk solution with a strainer 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:58.400
 Approximately 8 minutes into the grilled container 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:12.480
 Put in a deep baking dish 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:19.760
 Inject the boiling water into the baking tray to a depth of about 1/2 of the container 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:36.640
 Bake in an oven that has been preheated to 150 Â° C for 25-30 minutes 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:49.740
 When the time is up, shake the cup gently to see if there is any liquid shaking. If not, you can release it. 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.460
 Cool down completely in the refrigerator for 3-4 hours 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:59.260
 Use a thin knife to make a circle around the container and then cover it with a plate and then flip it. The 2 hands are fastened and the glass is shaken up and down to release the mold. 

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:28.560
 Enjoy !
