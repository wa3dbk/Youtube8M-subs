00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:53.620
 wireless doorbell wireless 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.820
 the site says that there is a remote 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:59.190
 remote control digital 38 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.230
 melodies 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:06.729
 Now open this package and see 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:09.789
 what's here in this parcel tanaka 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:12.780
 closes don't even cut off 

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:12.780
 scissors 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:28.130
 extract the contents of the bag is empty 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.130
 there's practically nothing here we see 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:41.970
 myself here is the doorbell itself which can 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.910
 mounted in an apartment or maybe just 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:48.570
 be put in an apartment in which place 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:50.460
 to hear the bell or maybe 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.390
 on the wall attached here here there 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.280
 such a hole for the hoist for the screw who 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:01.500
 either for a clove so that you can 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.300
 just hang in the battery pack and not 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:08.459
 are included 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:11.820
 There are two such screws included 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.489
 I think that in order to the wall 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:19.050
 probably 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:26.040
 attach probably himself who will 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:29.280
 there is a button to call which is 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.620
 this button that hangs around 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:35.630
 the front door at the entrance she will lose 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.630
 probably in order to secure this 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:47.400
 the button and the back is kinda sticky 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:50.269
 sticker double-sided sticky sticker 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:57.420
 which is probably mounted on the back 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:03:00.390
 panel here this very ebshi button 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.560
 late probably to his door it was possible 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:08.160
 to attach 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:11.090
 and understand that the back of the batteries is not necessary 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.090
 here are the batteries 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:24.720
 Now we will try to insert 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:26.900
 here are two power supplies such fingertips 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.900
 batteries 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:36.560
 we put on these batteries further we close 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:53.819
 here we close the cover we see the regulator 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:04:06.120
 volume is very weak 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:04:10.349
 and quietly probably understand it and the buttons here 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:12.360
 we can test this here 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:15.360
 the device is the most the call will be 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:19.079
 be in your apartment and this button 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:21.989
 you will have an entrance door 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:24.300
 the doors and that's probably here even me right now 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:27.510
 I will say that here this cap is removed 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:32.010
 and you can even for example like abroad 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:34.440
 They can even write the name of the tenant 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.600
 who are here to have but it 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.750
 we are not so accepted abroad write 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.430
 the name of the tenant or you can even write 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.080
 apartment number if you do not have the door 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:47.070
 this apartment number can write a number 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:51.139
 Apartments here now demonstrate how 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:54.620
 it is in the apartment it is on 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:54.620
 transitional trees 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.120
 what is she 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.730
 and this is a selection of tunes 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:12.090
 Now I have to figure it out 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:39.470
 something it can not be triggered 

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:50.200
 inside here probably come here inside 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:54.620
 batteries how should it work i don't 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:58.720
 I know, but the principle is what I am 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:06:02.300
 I'll figure it out then write under the video that 

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:05.210
 principle such that it is wireless 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.640
 the call is put in the apartment button 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:10.010
 set a goal 

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:12.230
 hung on the door and the visitor who 

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:15.740
 will come he presses and you will 

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:22.190
 see dear friends of you all 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:24.680

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:29.840

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:33.910
