00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.230 
with and fill that foil up and then
we'll<00:01:40.740> save<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:40.979> third<00:01:41.280> of<00:01:41.430> it<00:01:41.549> for<00:01:41.759> when<00:01:42.090> we

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
we'll save a third of it for when we

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.719

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
take it the last 45 minutes which I'll

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.179 
take it the last 45 minutes which I'll
pry<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.090> pop<00:01:45.329> back<00:01:45.540> on<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:45.930> show<00:01:46.110> you<00:01:46.189> will

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
pry and pop back on and show you will

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.700

heat<00:01:49.920> so<00:01:50.189> I'll<00:01:50.340> wind<00:01:50.610> up<00:01:52.070> throwing<00:01:53.070> poles<00:01:53.460> into

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
heat so I'll wind up throwing poles into

00:01:53.759 --> 00:02:00.139 
heat so I'll wind up throwing poles into
the<00:01:54.409> bottom<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:56.329> we'll<00:01:58.009> do<00:01:59.009> a<00:01:59.040> direct<00:01:59.909> grill

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.999 
the bottom and we'll do a direct grill
for<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.420> last<00:02:00.630> little<00:02:00.869> bit<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.380> that's<00:02:01.799> when

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
for the last little bit and that's when

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.910 
for the last little bit and that's when
we'll<00:02:02.159> add<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:03.060> wood<00:02:03.270> for<00:02:03.509> smoke<00:02:03.840> so<00:02:04.560> I've
