flower ah you've got these rectangular
sections<00:00:49.020> here<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.350> then<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.090> l-shaped

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
sections here and then the l-shaped

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.150 
sections here and then the l-shaped
sections<00:00:51.539> out<00:00:51.660> here<00:00:51.899> if<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.320> air<00:00:52.649> defenses

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
sections out here if the air defenses

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.790 
sections out here if the air defenses
are<00:00:53.399> in<00:00:53.520> these<00:00:53.640> spots<00:00:54.030> in<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.289> rectangles

are in these spots in the the rectangles
then<00:00:56.010> this<00:00:56.160> attack<00:00:56.460> will<00:00:56.579> work<00:00:56.730> on<00:00:56.940> on<00:00:57.390> this

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
then this attack will work on on this

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.619 
then this attack will work on on this
design<00:00:58.190> so<00:00:59.190> let's<00:01:00.090> have<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.239> look<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.420> see<00:01:00.480> what

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
design so let's have a look to see what

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.389 
design so let's have a look to see what
crack<00:01:00.809> does<00:01:00.989> it's<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.559> goal<00:01:01.739> of<00:01:01.829> our<00:01:02.010> attack<00:01:02.219> so

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
crack does it's a goal of our attack so

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.799 
crack does it's a goal of our attack so
down<00:01:02.550> go<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.699> couple<00:01:02.969> of<00:01:03.030> golems<00:01:03.300> first<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.690> the

of external term with hoaxes about us

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.730 
of external term with hoaxes about us
so<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.540> Hogs<00:01:48.720> are<00:01:48.810> important<00:01:49.200> they<00:01:49.320> take<00:01:49.560> down

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
so the Hogs are important they take down

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.800 
so the Hogs are important they take down
that<00:01:49.920> air<00:01:50.100> defense<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.640> then<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.509> Queen

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
that air defense and then the Queen

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.630 
that air defense and then the Queen
heads<00:01:52.380> over<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:52.740> she<00:01:52.890> hops<00:01:53.130> over<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.520> this

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
heads over and she hops over to this

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.830 
heads over and she hops over to this
second<00:01:54.030> air<00:01:54.090> defense<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.390> that's<00:01:54.479> all<00:01:54.689> he's

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
second air defense and that's all he's

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:55.819 
second air defense and that's all he's
waiting<00:01:55.079> for<00:01:55.110> as<00:01:55.290> soon<00:01:55.439> as<00:01:55.560> that<00:01:55.680> air<00:01:55.799> defense

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
waiting for as soon as that air defense

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.889 
waiting for as soon as that air defense
goes<00:01:56.189> down<00:01:56.369> in<00:01:56.759> goes<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.119> first<00:01:57.420> hound<00:01:57.719> and

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
goes down in goes the first hound and

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.690 
goes down in goes the first hound and
like<00:01:58.020> I've<00:01:58.200> said<00:01:58.229> before<00:01:58.409> in<00:01:58.890> my<00:01:59.310> last<00:01:59.460> couple

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
like I've said before in my last couple

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.800 
like I've said before in my last couple
of<00:01:59.790> videos<00:01:59.880> I've<00:02:00.149> been<00:02:00.180> talking<00:02:00.540> about<00:02:00.630> this

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
of videos I've been talking about this

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.679 
of videos I've been talking about this
idea<00:02:00.990> so<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.950> Hound<00:02:02.250> goes<00:02:02.729> in<00:02:03.000> as<00:02:03.210> far<00:02:03.450> away

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
idea so the Hound goes in as far away

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.030 
idea so the Hound goes in as far away
from<00:02:03.750> that<00:02:03.899> air<00:02:04.170> defense<00:02:04.200> as<00:02:04.590> he<00:02:04.649> can<00:02:04.770> get<00:02:04.920> he's

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
from that air defense as he can get he's

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.410 
from that air defense as he can get he's
headed<00:02:05.280> for<00:02:05.399> this<00:02:05.460> one<00:02:05.640> but<00:02:05.729> drop<00:02:06.090> some<00:02:06.270> hunt

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
headed for this one but drop some hunt

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.650 
headed for this one but drop some hunt
in<00:02:06.600> out<00:02:06.810> here<00:02:07.049> basically<00:02:07.890> he's<00:02:08.610> screening<00:02:09.479> all

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
in out here basically he's screening all

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.330 
in out here basically he's screening all
of<00:02:09.959> these<00:02:10.140> balloons<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.770> balloons<00:02:10.800> are<00:02:11.250> now

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
going to be dropped in behind the hound

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.210 
going to be dropped in behind the hound
in<00:02:13.390> order<00:02:13.690> to<00:02:13.720> get<00:02:14.020> these<00:02:14.170> defenses<00:02:14.590> down<00:02:14.740> all

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
in order to get these defenses down all

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.620 
in order to get these defenses down all
the<00:02:15.430> defense's<00:02:15.790> just<00:02:15.940> focus<00:02:16.210> on<00:02:16.330> the<00:02:16.390> ham<00:02:16.510> they

a<00:02:41.500> couple<00:02:41.770> up<00:02:41.860> here<00:02:44.190> and<00:02:45.190> there<00:02:46.030> we<00:02:46.090> go<00:02:46.240> the

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
a couple up here and there we go the

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.500 
a couple up here and there we go the
hound<00:02:47.470> is<00:02:47.650> blanketing<00:02:48.190> the<00:02:48.220> air<00:02:48.760> defense<00:02:49.180> and

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
hound is blanketing the air defense and

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.260 
hound is blanketing the air defense and
that's<00:02:49.810> it<00:02:50.080> they're<00:02:50.830> all<00:02:50.980> done<00:02:51.160> this<00:02:51.910> base<00:02:52.120> has

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
that's it they're all done this base has

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:57.750 
that's it they're all done this base has
no<00:02:52.420> chance<00:02:52.660> so<00:02:55.440> that's<00:02:56.440> it<00:02:56.680> massive<00:02:57.280> overkill

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
no chance so that's it massive overkill

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.960 
no chance so that's it massive overkill
I<00:02:57.940> mean<00:02:58.090> he's<00:02:58.210> still<00:02:58.300> got<00:02:58.570> a<00:02:58.600> hound<00:02:58.930> left

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
I mean he's still got a hound left

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.480 
I mean he's still got a hound left
probably<00:03:00.970> six<00:03:01.300> or<00:03:01.420> seven<00:03:01.660> balloons<00:03:01.900> it's<00:03:02.740> it's

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:03.490 
probably six or seven balloons it's it's

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.240 
probably six or seven balloons it's it's
crazy

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
crazy

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.040 
crazy
so<00:03:06.250> that's<00:03:06.670> how<00:03:06.850> you<00:03:06.910> three<00:03:07.240> stir<00:03:07.510> the<00:03:07.750> dragon

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
so that's how you three stir the dragon

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.200 
so that's how you three stir the dragon
flower<00:03:08.200> you<00:03:08.740> do<00:03:08.920> need<00:03:09.100> high-level<00:03:09.580> heroes<00:03:09.910> so

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:10.210
