00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.160
 beautiful 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.160
 they just 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.700
 they play in the reserve team 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.980
 what's in the region 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.770
 and everyone's dream is to get a 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.660
 place in the titular team but for that 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.790
 must show their skills and present 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.790
 a certain number of tests 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:43.010
 you're good, resist a little 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.170
 gonzález what do you want to say what happens 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.210
 only received one is created from au 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.710
 mile we told them that if any of them 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.659
 could address the defense of us 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.609
 three we would say to the eduardo coach 

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:55.640
 that will happen to us to the titular equipment and without 

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:58.789
 think it the novice challenged us we go that 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.409
 happens who dares to challenge us 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:02.270
 your opportunity to become the 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:05.600
 Headlines 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:08.680
 very well I will do it the serrano the 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.680
 strongest goal scorer 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:14.480
 perfect you can attack us when you want 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.290
 try to circumvent our defense by using 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.290
 all your strength 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.600
 here I go 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.400
 I'll take care of him 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:38.159
 always mocked the first 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.670
 although that is exactly what I 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.670
 I expected 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.900
 are the defenses of the starting team 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:02:00.280
 gonzález 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:02.380
 simply and last mile were 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.440
 suspended for the sessions that they had 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:08.420
 apparently everyone has recovered will be 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.220
 interesting to see them play 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.360
 what happens there is no other that wants 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.190
 cheer me up 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.590
 it is impossible to face the three 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:20.810
 We are going to get defenses 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.620
 those hurt, I'll try 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.680
 but back 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.450
 let me try it please who 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.900
 demons are you do not belong to the team 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.819
 go away you 're not part of the team 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.510
 his name is oliver atom and he will play with 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:39.480
 us next season he said 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.950
 serrano you could not lend him his tacos 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:47.560
 for this young man to play yes sir 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:49.360
 oliver atom the player of illusionantes 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.790
 each player has a position 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:55.010
 determined on the team if each of 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.930
 we will have to leave 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.640
 and nothing else the salt go dijk to that 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.100
 showed up 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.380
 Although these tacos are borrowed, I am the 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:07.180
 owner of my own body I'm ready 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:10.550
 for when it is we will not be 1 against 3 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:13.040
 we are three against three 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:16.070
 the field and the ball will always be my 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:20.260
 friends who are smiling so much they see and 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.260
 dare to challenge us yes 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.120
 here I go 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.850
 This will be your first entry exam 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:34.590
 let's see if you really have talent for 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:37.530
 belong to the team of catalonia just 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:40.160
 to begin the one that I will not be the first to 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.160
 try 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:48.830
 the last century 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.830
 as well 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:54.760
 although a Brazilian-style pint does not 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.760
 it will happen 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.190
 at that point he will not be able to outsmart 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.490
 my arms to associate strongly with the 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:08.450
 opponent and that will not be able to move that is 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.450
 the mark of the snake 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.500
 has stopped their movements although this 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.040
 is the defense of the titular team of 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.040
 Catalonia 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:26.200
 what is he doing fighting the same dt 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:26.200
 Clement has great resistance 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:32.580
 like this the wind in looking for the way 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:34.630
 to get away using this method 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:38.250
 in agreement 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.250
 free time the countess 

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:48.960
 watch out 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:53.030
 by the way what do you think this is the 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.030
 true defense of a European team 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:05:00.140
 disappeared above as he could jump 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.270
 while running at that speed as 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:06.370
 now to handle your reflexes what 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:09.449
 you do not know is that my defense is always 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:13.160
 I had the opportunity to see it before 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:14.870
 I do not want to do the crimes 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.360
 thinks of the titular team does not leave 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.490
 escape to nobody 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.319
 but the ball is my friend so I do not 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.770
 I think giving them incredible what 

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:22.770
 elusive 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:30.580
 or not 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:32.990
 and the big ones I'm sorry but not anymore 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:35.310
 You will go far 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.760
 the ball and the field will always be 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.760
 removed 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:43.860
 excessive is very dangerous dodging and 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:48.849
 train in the value 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:52.719
 this fight is serious we will launch 

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:52.719
 or not 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:04.379
 oliver and what was that rookie thinking 

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:06.090
 instead of estimating high that he did not let go 

00:06:04.379 --> 00:06:08.729
 the ball and it goes directly against 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:10.590
 my tacos still has not finished the play 

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:12.420
 you have to attack 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:14.639
 O well 

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:19.129
 how can it be 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:19.129
 This is my time in the Spanish team 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:34.189
 that they take it to me 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:36.860
 and if caribe there is no doubt that he is afraid 

00:06:34.189 --> 00:06:40.150
 he said he's not that strong I did not imagine that 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.150
 I made a Chilean in that space 

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:45.540
 hears 

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:45.540
 you find good yes 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:55.990
 welcome from oliver team 

00:06:59.689 --> 00:07:02.739
 very happy
