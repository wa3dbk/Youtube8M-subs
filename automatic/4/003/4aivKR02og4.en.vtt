not a lot you could do with them so I'm

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.509 
not a lot you could do with them so I'm
799<00:04:14.760> I<00:04:15.239> got<00:04:15.570> this<00:04:15.660> at<00:04:15.810> target<00:04:16.229> so<00:04:16.470> I<00:04:16.739> think<00:04:17.310> an

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
799 I got this at target so I think an

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:18.920 
799 I got this at target so I think an
eight<00:04:17.669> dollar<00:04:17.820> price<00:04:18.180> tag<00:04:18.419> is<00:04:18.450> still<00:04:18.600> a<00:04:18.750> little

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
eight dollar price tag is still a little

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.259 
eight dollar price tag is still a little
steep<00:04:19.320> but<00:04:19.560> that's<00:04:20.400> just<00:04:20.549> my<00:04:20.729> being<00:04:20.970> old<00:04:21.150> I

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
steep but that's just my being old I

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:22.750 
steep but that's just my being old I
think<00:04:21.329> eight<00:04:21.630> bucks<00:04:21.900> is<00:04:22.080> too<00:04:22.200> steep<00:04:22.409> for<00:04:22.470> any

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
think eight bucks is too steep for any

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.610 
think eight bucks is too steep for any
three<00:04:23.760> and<00:04:23.849> three-quarter<00:04:24.240> inch<00:04:24.360> big<00:04:24.570> I<00:04:24.780> still
