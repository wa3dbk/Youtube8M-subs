00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
what I recall I could be totally messing

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.530 
what I recall I could be totally messing
that<00:01:17.340> up<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.610> he<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:17.880> slightly<00:01:18.090> wrong<00:01:18.330> but

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
that up and he and slightly wrong but

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.899 
that up and he and slightly wrong but
for<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.930> sake<00:01:19.170> of<00:01:19.350> this<00:01:20.159> vlog<00:01:20.490> we're<00:01:20.790> gonna

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
for the sake of this vlog we're gonna

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.929 
for the sake of this vlog we're gonna
pretend<00:01:21.299> like<00:01:21.390> I'm<00:01:21.630> right<00:01:21.810> even<00:01:22.350> if<00:01:22.470> I'm<00:01:22.590> not

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
pretend like I'm right even if I'm not

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:27.620 
pretend like I'm right even if I'm not
so<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:24.540> got<00:01:24.840> me<00:01:24.990> thinking<00:01:25.909> what<00:01:26.909> in<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.299> world

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
so it got me thinking what in the world

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.289 
so it got me thinking what in the world
would<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.259> do<00:01:28.740> if<00:01:29.130> you<00:01:29.729> got<00:01:30.180> asked<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.689> review

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
would you do if you got asked to review

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:35.149 
would you do if you got asked to review
some<00:01:33.299> of<00:01:33.360> these<00:01:33.540> at<00:01:33.960> not<00:01:34.320> knowing<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.710> brands

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
some of these at not knowing the brands

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.620 
some of these at not knowing the brands
because<00:01:35.250> they<00:01:35.460> wanted<00:01:35.700> I<00:01:35.790> gets<00:01:35.970> comparison

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
because they wanted I gets comparison

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.080 
because they wanted I gets comparison
and<00:01:36.930> I<00:01:37.110> think<00:01:38.070> that<00:01:38.280> they<00:01:38.430> told<00:01:38.670> her<00:01:38.820> she

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
and I think that they told her she

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.490 
and I think that they told her she
didn't<00:01:39.299> have<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.630> actually<00:01:39.869> blog<00:01:40.229> about<00:01:40.380> it
