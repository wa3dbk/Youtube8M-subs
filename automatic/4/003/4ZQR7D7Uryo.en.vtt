00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.360
 and so it is 

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:11.170
 hello everyone welcome osanga siresa 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.380
 art today I bring you the tutorial of this 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:16.960
 makeup that I find super cute is 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:19.240
 a very colorful makeup and very subject 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:22.150
 with the holidays approaching from guiding 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.920
 action of grace almost almost and Christmas very 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.560
 easy to perform and you will see that 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.270
 use your fingers mostly so if 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.250
 I could do it with my fingers because you 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:33.100
 you will not be able to just have to practice 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.020
 and practice for my Christmas is synonymous 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.390
 of red lips I do not know why it's good 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.899
 actually almost every party like that 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:43.329
 I do not know end of the year I always tend to use 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:45.339
 the red lips is actually a 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:47.350
 red but pulling like brown is a 

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:50.079
 brownish red and you also have a 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.449
 little wine inside a red wine 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:54.699
 more pink there are to describe the 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:56.589
 colors I'm terrible but I like it a lot 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:57.969
 because it has a finish like matte 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:59.499
 places you will see the internal 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:01.359
 tutorial the products that I use 

00:00:59.499 --> 00:01:02.890
 I checked in the information box 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:04.839
 because there they were also left written 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.330
 I think that as a whole is a makeup 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.850
 pretty glamorous and I know the rules 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.680
 of the makeup they say of not using a 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.180
 intense makeup in the eyes and also 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.770
 an intense makeup on the lips 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.480
 but the rules were also made for 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.700
 do broken and the truth is that to me 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.490
 love when I want to look like this 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.410
 very striking because I like to exaggerate in 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.670
 the two sides did not flatter me anymore with the 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:28.960
 Introduction I leave the tutorial 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.910
 apply this base of l'oréal that 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.100
 averaged hiding wrinkles and pores 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.140
 dilated I like quite a result 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.930
 that leaves and next to the corrector sixty is 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.520
 latterly as preferred means are not 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:44.170
 it accumulates in the lines and well 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:47.259
 blurring leaves a natural result in 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:50.380
 the lips took as eyeliner the 812 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:52.180
 of nix and lipstick number 11 of mascara and 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.340
 now let's focus on the eyes 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.740
 which is the part that gives us the most work 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.259
 start applying the sisi corrector in 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.420
 the eyelid to uniform the color and 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:04.240
 makes the shadows homogeneous and 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.250
 lasts longer it blew it well and 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.440
 as the first shadow I will place this 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.420
 golden of l'oréal that those who follow me 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.300
 They know for a long time that I love these 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:14.680
 shadows for its pigmentation and texture the 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.020
 I will place on the entire eyelid mobile 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.090
 under the arch of the eyebrows and in the 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.160
 first part of the lower eyelid 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.950
 and I apply it with my finger because it is more 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:27.010
 intense and homogeneous now of the palette 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.050
 of the 88 colors and I'm going to take this 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:34.269
 orange color and placed it on the end 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:38.650
 of the upper eyelid as well as throughout 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:41.170
 of the whole basin then I'm going to take a 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.569
 bronze brown color and placed it over 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:46.120
 of the orange but being careful not to 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:49.799
 cover it completely and helped me with the 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:52.420
 Clean fingers to blur edges 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:54.730
 Now from the naked 3 I'm going to take this 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.489
 burgundy color that is like a brown with 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.280
 red wine reflections placed it in the 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:02.140
 external angle and basin this is going to give 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.360
 more dimension to the makeup and if it 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.090
 set each time you placed a new color 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.280
 I try not to cover the previous ones and 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.650
 always soften the edges so that it 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.230
 create a smooth transition they are setting 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.060
 that both eyes are the same and here I 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:20.459
 I'm noticing that I should intensify the 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.459
 orange so I add it and it blurs 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.430
 now goes to make up the eyelid 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.340
 inferior and the first thing I do is 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.290
 place the concealer and blur it 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.510
 placed the orange color first and 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.670
 then with a pointed brush I will 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.250
 take up the burgundy color and apply it 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:41.350
 Pegadito to the eyelashes leaving free 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.350
 only the part where I placed the gold 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.209
 now I'm going to outline the eyes and I'm going to 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.640
 make up the water line that the 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:51.530
 upper and lower eyelid is more to me 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.239
 easy to start from the middle back and 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.489
 left for the end the initial part of 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:57.650
 eyelid that always change the position 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:00.230
 of the pencil so that I got thinner 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.570
 stroke on the lower eyelid I go alone to 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.400
 intensify the extreme and blur everything 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.080
 the delineated with a brush for 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:10.720
 integrate it with the rest of the makeup and 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.720
 give that smoked touch to the whole 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.650
 I'm going to place false eyelashes this 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:21.260
 Step is optional if you do not feel comfortable 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.780
 using them, go deep with the mask 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.430
 eyelashes but with this makeup of 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.710
 eyes the false eyelashes are a 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.330
 perfect complement if you're 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.669
 Now approaching the world of eyelashes 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.169
 false and you want to deepen I'm going to 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:35.330
 leave at the end of this video and in the 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:37.430
 information box the link to a 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.280
 video where I share everything I know 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.139
 on the subject check what I now pray 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.660
 eyelashes to melt the natural ones with 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:46.820
 the inserts and I put mask only on 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:49.880
 the natural ones, the artificial ones 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:52.190
 we can reuse I will place a 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.500
 warm flush is a brown with its tone 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.419
 orange and I take advantage and also makes a 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.930
 little with turin in the temple in the 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:00.789
 dewlap 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.770
 Well, this would be the final result 

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:04.840
 I hope you liked the 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:06.759
 makeup that they are encouraged to do it and 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.169
 So if we have a factory in 

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:10.570
 my social networks that I love to see 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:13.600
 the makeups that I'm doing that 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:15.220
 they begin to ask me theirs 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.830
 I also decided to put a dark color on 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:19.600
 the area this color is very nice 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.430
 see if I liked it when there was 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.199
 result of boom but we have more 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.389
 enough photos and I will post them in 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:27.370
 the blog so I made an entry in the 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:29.949
 blog showing them a little better the 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.870
 enamel and giving my opinion I leave you the 

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:34.000
 link to the blog post in the 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.650
 little box of information that everything 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.720
 is in the information box open 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:39.970
 the is easy opens where it says 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:43.150
 show more a little button out there 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.860
 below and another idea that I had was that to 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:47.139
 from now on I will finish the 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.880
 videos answering a question from the 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:50.830
 that you leave me because I always 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.810
 they are asking repeated questions 

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.699
 then to be able to respond to the greatest 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.229
 number of possible people who have 

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:57.820
 the same restlessness because I will be 

00:05:56.229 --> 00:06:00.039
 answering the question in a video 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:02.710
 I've been asking for a while now what 

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:05.620
 makeup values ​​the eyes that 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:07.930
 I also have drooping eyelids 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:10.930
 of eyelid dropped what things the papacy 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:14.669
 fallen when the eyelid goes up and almost 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:16.810
 that we say joins the eyelashes see 

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:19.180
 the people who do not have the papacy 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:22.510
 fallen almost always have the eyelid 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:24.729
 fully exposed and are the 

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:26.800
 people who are going to see the most 

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:29.470
 eye makeup let's say it's the 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:31.510
 eyelid ideal for makeup but 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:33.580
 because we have the drooping eyelid not 

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:36.190
 it means we have to give up the 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.449
 makeup or smoked for example 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:39.490
 this makeup that I just made 

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:41.440
 if you look at almost all my 

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:43.510
 videos I always exaggerate a little bit with 

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.310
 the dark shadow that is placed on the 

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:48.130
 external angle of the eyes to form 

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:50.500
 uve beniel exaggerated always the blurred 

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:53.560
 up and that's to correct 

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:55.900
 precisely the problem and half of the 

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:58.120
 drooping eyelid is going to give you a more 

00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:00.970
 almond to the eye and it will enlarge 

00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:03.370
 also the eye that is the trick that 

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:05.830
 I use leave me below this video the 

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:07.600
 question they want me to answer in 

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:08.800
 next and even now if I go a 

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:11.180
 I kiss well big and see you the 

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:14.180
 next video 

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:19.240
 Mom I adore that you know the date of 

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:19.240
 heading how to place the as we are
