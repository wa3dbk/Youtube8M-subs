the guitar is a piece of I think

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.610 
the guitar is a piece of I think
it's<00:00:36.630> mostly<00:00:37.140> because<00:00:38.510> UPS<00:00:39.510> did<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.410> lot<00:00:40.590> of

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
it's mostly because UPS did a lot of

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.030 
it's mostly because UPS did a lot of
banging<00:00:41.580> it<00:00:41.940> around<00:00:42.210> in<00:00:42.420> transit<00:00:42.990> so<00:00:43.770> it's

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
banging it around in transit so it's

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.750 
banging it around in transit so it's
