00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
you want to exchange your straight lines

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.100 
you want to exchange your straight lines
for<00:00:10.260> bubbles<00:00:10.590> so<00:00:11.099> if<00:00:11.250> you<00:00:11.370> draw<00:00:11.580> an<00:00:11.670> a<00:00:12.110> for

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
for bubbles so if you draw an a for

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.369 
for bubbles so if you draw an a for
instance<00:00:13.500> you<00:00:14.340> want<00:00:14.490> to<00:00:14.549> come<00:00:14.700> back<00:00:15.109> and<00:00:16.109> draw

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
instance you want to come back and draw

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.689 
instance you want to come back and draw
ellipse<00:00:16.830> or<00:00:18.080> circular<00:00:19.080> bubble<00:00:19.529> shapes<00:00:19.830> where

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
ellipse or circular bubble shapes where

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.580 
ellipse or circular bubble shapes where
your<00:00:20.850> straight<00:00:21.119> lines<00:00:21.390> are<00:00:21.660> now<00:00:22.199> you<00:00:22.260> notice

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
your straight lines are now you notice

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.730 
your straight lines are now you notice
I'm<00:00:22.740> drawn<00:00:23.010> in<00:00:23.250> pencil<00:00:23.460> here<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.740> drawing

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
I'm drawn in pencil here a drawing

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.769 
I'm drawn in pencil here a drawing
pencil<00:00:26.130> very<00:00:26.430> lightly<00:00:28.010> so<00:00:29.010> I<00:00:29.039> can<00:00:29.279> come<00:00:29.490> back

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:29.779 
pencil very lightly so I can come back

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.340 
pencil very lightly so I can come back
after<00:00:30.779> I<00:00:31.019> pick<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.740> lines<00:00:31.980> that<00:00:32.219> I<00:00:32.279> want<00:00:32.640> and

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
after I pick the lines that I want and

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.010 
after I pick the lines that I want and
erase<00:00:34.350> my<00:00:34.680> construction<00:00:35.100> lines<00:00:35.960> ok<00:00:36.960> so

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
erase my construction lines ok so

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.880 
erase my construction lines ok so
there's<00:00:37.350> an<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.680> B<00:00:39.020> C<00:00:40.020> if<00:00:40.320> you<00:00:40.410> have<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.590> curve

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
there's an a B C if you have a curve

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.600 
there's an a B C if you have a curve
like<00:00:40.920> this<00:00:41.309> maybe<00:00:41.579> break<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:42.090> into<00:00:42.239> segments

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.610 
like this maybe break it into segments

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.470 
like this maybe break it into segments
like<00:00:44.610> that<00:00:45.440> okay<00:00:46.789> we'll<00:00:47.789> start<00:00:48.030> with<00:00:48.120> four

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
like that okay we'll start with four

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.680 
like that okay we'll start with four
letters<00:00:49.370> and<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.460> D<00:00:50.730> would<00:00:51.239> have<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.420> little

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
letters and the D would have a little

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.400 
letters and the D would have a little
bit<00:00:51.809> of<00:00:51.840> both<00:00:53.809> all<00:00:54.809> right<00:00:54.960> there's<00:00:55.320> your

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
bit of both all right there's your

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.389 
bit of both all right there's your
bubble<00:00:55.770> letter<00:00:55.949> so<00:00:56.160> now<00:00:56.340> I<00:00:56.660> come<00:00:57.660> back<00:00:58.129> with<00:00:59.129> my

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
bubble letter so now I come back with my

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.970 
bubble letter so now I come back with my
marker<00:01:00.090> or<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.329> darker<00:01:00.840> colored<00:01:01.289> pencil<00:01:01.800> and

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
just pick the lines on these bubble

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.800 
just pick the lines on these bubble
letters<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:04.080> I<00:01:04.170> want<00:01:04.880> there's<00:01:05.880> for<00:01:06.780> instance

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
and drawn very lightly in my

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.980 
and drawn very lightly in my
construction<00:01:56.310> phase<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:57.360> should<00:01:57.630> be<00:01:57.750> very

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
construction phase it should be very

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.100 
construction phase it should be very
easy<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.560> come<00:01:58.770> back<00:01:59.240> and<00:02:00.240> erase<00:02:00.420> these

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
easy to come back and erase these

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.840 
easy to come back and erase these
construction<00:02:01.800> lines<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.370> see<00:02:02.550> what<00:02:02.730> I've

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
construction lines and see what I've

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.109 
construction lines and see what I've
ended<00:02:03.150> up<00:02:03.240> with<00:02:04.130> and<00:02:05.130> once<00:02:06.030> you<00:02:06.240> get<00:02:06.450> rid<00:02:06.840> of

ended up with and once you get rid of

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.880 
ended up with and once you get rid of
these<00:02:09.119> construction<00:02:09.810> lines<00:02:12.500> you<00:02:13.500> can<00:02:13.650> come

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
these construction lines you can come

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.660 
these construction lines you can come
back<00:02:14.480> with<00:02:15.480> your<00:02:15.660> colors<00:02:16.170> or<00:02:16.470> with<00:02:17.100> your<00:02:17.340> shat

back with your colors or with your shat
shading<00:02:18.360> and<00:02:19.310> make<00:02:20.310> them<00:02:20.490> look<00:02:20.760> even<00:02:21.570> more

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
shading and make them look even more

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.820 
shading and make them look even more
bubbly<00:02:23.810> for<00:02:24.810> instance<00:02:25.140> we'll<00:02:25.290> start<00:02:25.560> on<00:02:25.680> the<00:02:25.800> a

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
bubbly for instance we'll start on the a

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.630 
bubbly for instance we'll start on the a
and<00:02:26.280> I'll<00:02:26.490> just<00:02:26.730> use<00:02:26.820> a<00:02:26.940> pencil<00:02:27.270> for<00:02:27.690> shading<00:02:27.960> I

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
and I'll just use a pencil for shading I

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.540 
and I'll just use a pencil for shading I
might<00:02:29.640> come<00:02:29.910> in<00:02:30.180> and<00:02:30.440> round<00:02:31.440> it<00:02:31.620> out<00:02:31.770> even<00:02:32.130> more

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.670 

and<00:02:35.550> you<00:02:35.640> do<00:02:35.790> that<00:02:36.080> but<00:02:37.080> maybe<00:02:37.170> shading<00:02:37.650> just

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
and you do that but maybe shading just

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.700 
and you do that but maybe shading just
one<00:02:38.160> side<00:02:38.520> of<00:02:38.790> this<00:02:38.910> bubble<00:02:39.300> letter

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
one side of this bubble letter

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:44.960 
one side of this bubble letter
don't<00:02:40.710> try<00:02:40.950> to<00:02:41.010> shade<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.400> whole<00:02:41.550> thing<00:02:43.970> okay

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
don't try to shade the whole thing okay

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.660 
don't try to shade the whole thing okay
maybe<00:02:45.240> just<00:02:45.390> shade<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:45.690> bottom<00:02:45.960> side

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
maybe just shade the bottom side

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.070 
maybe just shade the bottom side
all<00:02:47.670> right<00:02:47.790> Nexen<00:02:48.270> Chewie<00:02:48.420> we're<00:02:48.690> the<00:02:48.840> little

bubbles come together okay all right you

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.010 
bubbles come together okay all right you
might<00:02:54.900> even<00:02:55.050> put<00:02:55.350> a<00:02:55.380> little<00:02:55.680> reflection<00:02:55.980> on<00:02:56.459> it

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
might even put a little reflection on it
