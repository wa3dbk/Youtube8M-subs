00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
see the color or whatever and I start

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.930 
see the color or whatever and I start
putting<00:02:18.930> neat<00:02:19.230> because<00:02:19.470> a<00:02:19.830> lot<00:02:20.069> of<00:02:20.099> times<00:02:20.459> you

little pissed off because of that um

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.650 
little pissed off because of that um
because<00:05:08.100> I<00:05:08.250> don't<00:05:08.430> I<00:05:08.700> don't<00:05:08.850> want<00:05:09.240> my<00:05:09.390> face<00:05:09.600> to

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700 
that's not cool um and I think no matter

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.460 
that's not cool um and I think no matter
how<00:05:14.790> much<00:05:15.120> powder<00:05:15.390> you<00:05:15.600> apply<00:05:15.870> during<00:05:16.140> the<00:05:16.290> day

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:16.470 
how much powder you apply during the day

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.920 
how much powder you apply during the day
it's<00:05:16.680> oh<00:05:16.919> it's<00:05:17.010> just<00:05:17.610> gonna<00:05:17.790> keep<00:05:18.150> seeping<00:05:18.750> out

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
it's oh it's just gonna keep seeping out

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.130 
it's oh it's just gonna keep seeping out
so<00:05:19.710> if<00:05:20.250> you're<00:05:20.460> oily<00:05:20.940> I<00:05:21.180> don't<00:05:21.390> recommend<00:05:21.690> that

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:22.140 
so if you're oily I don't recommend that

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:25.260 
you buy this um I thought it would be a

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:26.779 
you buy this um I thought it would be a
lot<00:05:25.440> better<00:05:25.470> for<00:05:25.710> the<00:05:25.919> price<00:05:26.220> but<00:05:26.520> like<00:05:26.610> I<00:05:26.729> said

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:26.789 
lot better for the price but like I said

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:28.430 
lot better for the price but like I said
the<00:05:27.060> only<00:05:27.090> good<00:05:27.360> thing<00:05:27.630> I<00:05:27.720> like<00:05:27.900> about<00:05:27.960> it<00:05:28.320> is

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
the only good thing I like about it is

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.460 
the only good thing I like about it is
the<00:05:28.590> coverage<00:05:29.010> the<00:05:29.669> color<00:05:30.090> however<00:05:30.630> is<00:05:31.050> way

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:31.470 
the coverage the color however is way

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.250 
the coverage the color however is way
too<00:05:31.530> way<00:05:32.430> too<00:05:32.460> light<00:05:32.880> for<00:05:32.910> me<00:05:33.210> I<00:05:33.270> think<00:05:33.390> I<00:05:33.720> got<00:05:33.960> a

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:34.260

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.620 
too way too light for me I think I got a
little<00:05:35.130> bit<00:05:35.310> more<00:05:35.340> tan<00:05:35.820> the<00:05:36.090> summer<00:05:36.360> than<00:05:36.600> I

you know it's a lot cheaper than this I
mean<00:06:12.400> I'm<00:06:12.670> just<00:06:12.700> like<00:06:12.970> if<00:06:13.510> you<00:06:13.630> guys<00:06:13.750> watch<00:06:14.050> it

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:14.320 
mean I'm just like if you guys watch it

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.830 
mean I'm just like if you guys watch it
you<00:06:14.980> see<00:06:15.250> like<00:06:15.700> I<00:06:15.910> mean<00:06:16.090> that<00:06:16.270> would<00:06:16.390> be<00:06:16.420> a<00:06:16.540> good

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:16.840 
you see like I mean that would be a good

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.050 
you see like I mean that would be a good
thing<00:06:17.140> this<00:06:17.980> is<00:06:18.160> actually<00:06:18.520> a<00:06:18.550> good<00:06:18.850> foundation

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:19.060 
thing this is actually a good foundation

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:21.000 
thing this is actually a good foundation
I<00:06:19.480> guess<00:06:19.630> if<00:06:19.810> you<00:06:19.900> have<00:06:20.020> really<00:06:20.260> really<00:06:20.620> severe

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:21.010 
I guess if you have really really severe

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:24.720 
I guess if you have really really severe
dry<00:06:21.460> skin<00:06:21.850> but<00:06:22.540> um<00:06:22.720> you<00:06:23.500> know<00:06:23.620> make<00:06:24.490> sure<00:06:24.520> you

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:24.730 
dry skin but um you know make sure you

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:26.640 
dry skin but um you know make sure you
use<00:06:24.850> moisturizer<00:06:25.240> because<00:06:25.780> I<00:06:25.900> think<00:06:26.200> this<00:06:26.410> can

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:26.650 
use moisturizer because I think this can

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:30.650 
use moisturizer because I think this can
accentuate<00:06:27.040> the<00:06:27.610> flakes<00:06:27.940> on<00:06:28.150> the<00:06:28.210> side<00:06:28.420> but<00:06:29.230> um

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:30.660 
accentuate the flakes on the side but um

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:33.120 
accentuate the flakes on the side but um
yeah<00:06:31.660> oh<00:06:31.990> and<00:06:32.290> it<00:06:32.410> also<00:06:32.470> comes<00:06:32.830> with<00:06:32.890> a<00:06:32.980> little

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:33.130 
yeah oh and it also comes with a little

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:35.670 
yeah oh and it also comes with a little
sponge<00:06:33.300> but<00:06:34.300> I<00:06:34.600> mean<00:06:34.810> I<00:06:34.900> use<00:06:35.110> it<00:06:35.260> the<00:06:35.380> first

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:35.680 
sponge but I mean I use it the first

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.080 
sponge but I mean I use it the first
time<00:06:35.919> but<00:06:36.340> that<00:06:36.490> was<00:06:36.610> that<00:06:36.820> I'm<00:06:36.910> actually

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:37.090 
time but that was that I'm actually

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:41.010 
time but that was that I'm actually
throw<00:06:37.510> it<00:06:37.540> out<00:06:38.190> all<00:06:39.190> right<00:06:39.400> I'm<00:06:39.490> done<00:06:39.780> but<00:06:40.780> yeah

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:41.020 
throw it out all right I'm done but yeah
