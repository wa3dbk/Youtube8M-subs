kind of like an extra access right here
right<00:04:43.020> there<00:04:43.259> because<00:04:43.680> when<00:04:43.860> I<00:04:43.889> matched<00:04:44.159> up

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
right there because when I matched up

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.159 
right there because when I matched up
the<00:04:44.580> bottom<00:04:44.879> the<00:04:45.030> side<00:04:45.270> won<00:04:45.479> a<00:04:45.509> match<00:04:45.690> up<00:04:45.990> and

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
when I matched up the side the bottom

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.059
