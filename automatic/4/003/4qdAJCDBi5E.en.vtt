thing<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:18.960> do<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.650> problem<00:01:20.009> is<00:01:20.159> they<00:01:20.280> were

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
thing to do the problem is they were

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.969 
thing to do the problem is they were
getting<00:01:20.610> water<00:01:20.970> kefir<00:01:21.240> grains<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:22.140> trying<00:01:22.770> to

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
getting water kefir grains and trying to

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.570 
getting water kefir grains and trying to
ferment<00:01:23.340> milk<00:01:24.140> with<00:01:25.140> them<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.680> that<00:01:26.040> just<00:01:26.310> it

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
ferment milk with them and that just it

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.030 
ferment milk with them and that just it
just<00:01:26.790> doesn't<00:01:27.150> work<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.600> can't<00:01:27.900> really<00:01:28.740> take

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
just doesn't work you can't really take

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.980 
just doesn't work you can't really take
they're<00:01:29.280> not<00:01:29.430> interchangeable<00:01:29.700> when<00:01:30.689> you<00:01:30.810> get

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
they're not interchangeable when you get

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.050 
they're not interchangeable when you get
water<00:01:31.259> kefir<00:01:31.590> grains<00:01:31.829> like<00:01:32.280> this<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:32.820> really

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
water kefir grains like this you really

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.700 
water kefir grains like this you really
need<00:01:33.299> to<00:01:33.450> make<00:01:33.570> water<00:01:33.900> kaffir<00:01:34.380> with<00:01:34.560> it

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
need to make water kaffir with it

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.370 
need to make water kaffir with it
because<00:01:34.890> this<00:01:35.220> type<00:01:35.490> of<00:01:35.520> culture<00:01:36.020> does<00:01:37.020> best

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
because this type of culture does best

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.960
