00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:13.439 
skate shoe it's their fusion skate shoe
which<00:00:11.320> is<00:00:11.469> like<00:00:11.740> the<00:00:12.010> greatest<00:00:12.789> technology

00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:13.449 
which is like the greatest technology

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:16.019 
which is like the greatest technology
ever<00:00:14.080> and<00:00:14.559> a<00:00:14.680> skate<00:00:14.889> shoe<00:00:15.129> I'll<00:00:15.490> explain<00:00:15.820> it<00:00:15.969> a

ever and a skate shoe I'll explain it a

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:18.210 
ever and a skate shoe I'll explain it a
little<00:00:16.059> bit<00:00:16.359> anyways<00:00:17.109> this<00:00:17.619> is<00:00:17.680> Jerry<00:00:17.980> Sue's

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:18.220 
little bit anyways this is Jerry Sue's

little bit anyways this is Jerry Sue's
second<00:00:18.880> shoe<00:00:19.029> from<00:00:19.750> America<00:00:20.710> let's<00:00:21.250> look<00:00:21.339> at

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:21.490 
second shoe from America let's look at

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.310 
second shoe from America let's look at
some<00:00:21.580> of<00:00:21.699> the<00:00:21.759> features<00:00:21.880> like<00:00:22.749> I<00:00:22.839> said<00:00:23.050> it's

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:23.320 
some of the features like I said it's

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.950 
some of the features like I said it's
the<00:00:23.529> suit<00:00:23.800> to<00:00:24.070> fusion<00:00:24.580> this<00:00:25.269> is<00:00:25.480> a<00:00:25.570> fusion

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:25.960 
the suit to fusion this is a fusion

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.519 
the suit to fusion this is a fusion
vulcanized<00:00:26.919> design<00:00:27.369> which<00:00:28.179> is<00:00:28.570> a<00:00:29.079> huge

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:29.529 
vulcanized design which is a huge

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:31.349 
vulcanized design which is a huge
improvement<00:00:29.650> over<00:00:30.070> normal<00:00:30.699> vulcanized

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:31.359 
improvement over normal vulcanized

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:34.590 
improvement over normal vulcanized
processes<00:00:31.989> usually<00:00:32.619> you<00:00:32.980> have<00:00:33.220> your<00:00:33.820> outsole

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:34.600 
processes usually you have your outsole

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.230 
processes usually you have your outsole
and<00:00:34.810> then<00:00:35.290> you<00:00:35.470> have<00:00:35.650> a<00:00:35.680> die-cut<00:00:36.340> midsole<00:00:36.850> that

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:37.240 
and then you have a die-cut midsole that

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.180 
and then you have a die-cut midsole that
goes<00:00:37.390> in<00:00:37.660> that<00:00:37.840> and<00:00:38.080> then<00:00:38.110> you<00:00:38.560> put<00:00:38.710> the<00:00:38.860> upper

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
goes in that and then you put the upper

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.610 
goes in that and then you put the upper
on<00:00:39.310> top<00:00:39.490> of<00:00:39.640> it<00:00:39.760> it's<00:00:40.150> glued<00:00:40.510> together<00:00:40.690> you<00:00:41.410> put

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
on top of it it's glued together you put

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.710 
on top of it it's glued together you put
a<00:00:41.650> piece<00:00:42.010> of<00:00:42.040> foxing<00:00:42.610> tape<00:00:42.790> around<00:00:43.030> it<00:00:43.240> glue

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:43.720 
a piece of foxing tape around it glue

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.100 
a piece of foxing tape around it glue
that<00:00:43.900> together<00:00:44.140> bake<00:00:44.770> it<00:00:45.510> not<00:00:46.510> with<00:00:46.720> fusion

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.110 
that together bake it not with fusion

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.730 
that together bake it not with fusion
you've<00:00:47.470> got<00:00:47.800> your<00:00:48.670> outsole<00:00:49.630> and<00:00:49.810> midsole<00:00:50.560> that

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:50.740 
you've got your outsole and midsole that

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.550 
you've got your outsole and midsole that
are<00:00:50.830> fused<00:00:51.220> together<00:00:51.370> and<00:00:51.880> then<00:00:52.480> the<00:00:53.080> upward

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:53.560 
are fused together and then the upward

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.500 
are fused together and then the upward
goes<00:00:53.770> on<00:00:53.920> top<00:00:54.070> of<00:00:54.130> that<00:00:54.430> and<00:00:54.670> it's<00:00:55.000> all<00:00:55.210> kind<00:00:55.450> of

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
goes on top of that and it's all kind of

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.240 
goes on top of that and it's all kind of
like<00:00:55.600> one<00:00:55.930> piece<00:00:56.230> and<00:00:56.530> it<00:00:56.860> just<00:00:57.010> provides

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
like one piece and it just provides

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.420 
like one piece and it just provides
great<00:00:57.940> durability<00:00:58.560> flexibility<00:00:59.560> it's<00:01:00.010> super

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 
great durability flexibility it's super

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.100 
great durability flexibility it's super
light<00:01:00.580> so<00:01:00.790> you<00:01:00.850> get<00:01:00.970> to<00:01:01.060> skate<00:01:01.270> longer<00:01:01.690> without

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.110 
light so you get to skate longer without

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.280 
light so you get to skate longer without
getting<00:01:02.590> tired<00:01:02.880> sooo<00:01:03.880> to<00:01:04.119> fusion<00:01:04.570> fusion

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
getting tired sooo to fusion fusion

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.319 
getting tired sooo to fusion fusion
technology<00:01:05.619> is<00:01:06.070> really<00:01:06.310> cool<00:01:06.520> let's<00:01:07.119> look<00:01:07.210> at

00:01:07.319 --> 00:01:07.329 
technology is really cool let's look at

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:09.270 
technology is really cool let's look at
some<00:01:07.390> of<00:01:07.509> the<00:01:07.659> features<00:01:07.780> as<00:01:08.140> you<00:01:08.619> can<00:01:08.740> see<00:01:08.890> kind

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
some of the features as you can see kind

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.069 
some of the features as you can see kind
of<00:01:09.399> like<00:01:09.490> a<00:01:09.549> short<00:01:09.850> toe<00:01:10.090> cap<00:01:10.359> looks<00:01:10.749> like<00:01:10.929> it's

00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:11.079 
of like a short toe cap looks like it's

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:13.620 
of like a short toe cap looks like it's
got<00:01:11.200> stitch<00:01:11.770> and<00:01:12.009> turn<00:01:12.509> construction<00:01:13.509> right

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
got stitch and turn construction right

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.080 
got stitch and turn construction right
there<00:01:13.869> as<00:01:14.109> a<00:01:14.170> postage<00:01:14.979> is<00:01:15.130> two<00:01:15.549> panels<00:01:15.909> stitch

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
there as a postage is two panels stitch

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.300 
there as a postage is two panels stitch
together<00:01:16.240> so<00:01:16.869> that<00:01:16.929> provides<00:01:17.439> a<00:01:17.770> little<00:01:18.189> bit

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
together so that provides a little bit

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.539 
together so that provides a little bit
more<00:01:18.490> durability<00:01:19.259> it's<00:01:20.259> a<00:01:20.350> mid<00:01:20.499> top<00:01:20.710> so<00:01:21.490> you

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:21.549 
more durability it's a mid top so you

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:23.849 
more durability it's a mid top so you
got<00:01:21.670> good<00:01:21.939> ankle<00:01:22.270> protection<00:01:22.359> the<00:01:23.350> caller<00:01:23.619> is

00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:23.859 
got good ankle protection the caller is

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:26.279 
got good ankle protection the caller is
really<00:01:24.369> thinly<00:01:24.579> padded<00:01:24.850> but<00:01:25.420> it<00:01:25.509> does<00:01:25.899> provide

00:01:26.279 --> 00:01:26.289 
really thinly padded but it does provide

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:29.010 
really thinly padded but it does provide
some<00:01:26.560> padding<00:01:27.219> nice<00:01:28.210> padded<00:01:28.689> tongue<00:01:28.840> right

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
some padding nice padded tongue right

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.739 
some padding nice padded tongue right
here<00:01:29.319> another<00:01:29.770> cool<00:01:29.979> thing<00:01:30.039> is<00:01:30.490> if<00:01:31.359> you<00:01:31.600> can

00:01:31.739 --> 00:01:31.749 
here another cool thing is if you can

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:33.929 
here another cool thing is if you can
see<00:01:31.899> right<00:01:31.929> there<00:01:32.639> they've<00:01:33.639> got<00:01:33.759> like<00:01:33.880> a

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:33.939 
see right there they've got like a

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:35.190 
see right there they've got like a
couple<00:01:34.210> stitches<00:01:34.359> right<00:01:34.600> there<00:01:34.810> so<00:01:35.020> the

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
couple stitches right there so the

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.800 
couple stitches right there so the
tongue<00:01:35.770> can<00:01:36.009> actually<00:01:36.310> flex<00:01:36.670> forward<00:01:36.969> worth

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
tongue can actually flex forward worth

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.389 
tongue can actually flex forward worth
most<00:01:38.170> tongues<00:01:38.409> there's<00:01:38.710> one<00:01:38.889> piece<00:01:39.069> it<00:01:39.280> kind

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
most tongues there's one piece it kind

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:41.129 
most tongues there's one piece it kind
of<00:01:39.429> like<00:01:39.579> just<00:01:39.609> gets<00:01:39.880> pushed<00:01:40.090> back<00:01:40.270> so<00:01:40.509> with

00:01:41.129 --> 00:01:41.139 
of like just gets pushed back so with

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:42.719 
of like just gets pushed back so with
mid<00:01:41.319> tops<00:01:41.530> you<00:01:41.679> know<00:01:41.770> people<00:01:42.009> like<00:01:42.069> to<00:01:42.249> rock

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
mid tops you know people like to rock

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:44.340 
mid tops you know people like to rock
the<00:01:42.880> tongue<00:01:43.060> a<00:01:43.090> little<00:01:43.210> forward<00:01:43.539> so<00:01:44.170> that's

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
the tongue a little forward so that's

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.289 
the tongue a little forward so that's
cool<00:01:44.469> what<00:01:45.399> else<00:01:45.549> is<00:01:45.670> going<00:01:45.850> on<00:01:45.880> with<00:01:45.969> this<00:01:46.060> a

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:46.299 
cool what else is going on with this a

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:48.809 
cool what else is going on with this a
little<00:01:47.079> bit<00:01:47.289> extra<00:01:47.439> padding<00:01:47.979> right<00:01:48.130> in<00:01:48.459> here

00:01:48.809 --> 00:01:48.819 
little bit extra padding right in here
