00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.340
 Hello dear craftsmen I am George 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:09.490
 Maxim I want to introduce you to my 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:12.220
 next job is a snow thrower 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.979
 to my tractor on the tractor I talk 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.470
 especially not going to be like in the last movie i 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:20.170
 already talked about him enough 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:23.110
 detail the truth about the Crimea 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:26.020
 thread for movie film requests turned out 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:31.860
 tanks back and stretched up now 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.860
 try to show its real size 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:48.880
 me on the tractor can still say through 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:52.210
 he has now undergone some upgrades 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.910
 so I installed more powerful 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.930
 13 cable engine instead of six 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:01.210
 set half why because 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.869
 set the hydraulics in my eyes snow 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:07.470
 it works from the thigh of the hydraulic motor 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:11.650
 hydraulics means ns-10 worth it 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:16.360
 also the inclusion through the tensioning roller is not 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:18.310
 Especially everyone knows the condensate engine here 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.470
 got caught with a starper with a starter in 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:24.570
 this particular need would not be 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:26.770
 cabin from it well did 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.019
 alarm to me 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.400
 somebody did not catch up while working 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:34.090
 us in our breadth 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:39.820
 in Perm we have a short night day 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:47.790
 long one headlamp in the usual counter 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:47.790
 tumanki set well, in general, then all 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.580
 the engine is more powerful why why 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.920
 what is the efficiency of our hydromotors sense 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.540
 in general they have enough hydromotors 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.819
 low 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:05.379
 I still got caught on hand 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:11.340
 would put it to an end i.e. hydraulic motor 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:15.280
 sister 32 is and they have even lower than 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.650
 axial piston motors still 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.200
 lower and efficiency 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:28.379
 I do not wish to fall then irreplaceable 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:28.379
 long here means why so long rotary 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:38.960
 snow thrower its advantage 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:38.960
 before it is an advantage before 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:44.580
 augers means that he is not afraid 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:48.300
 pieces of ice can curb there table 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:51.810
 prune off the road and he's all in size 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:54.180
 size crush and throws away 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.820
 he went through in some modernization yet 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:04:00.420
 did not try at the beginning of the video you will see 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:03.060
 saw there and then another test of him i 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:07.190
 then fluff gave a little hurt 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:12.360
 Deadly you did the same he stabbed 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:15.750
 now more well and done too 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:20.850
 I have wide holes here 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:23.640
 15 150 return them I also did 150 but 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:27.020
 here I have subtracted now to 10 on such 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:29.690
 rpm there is no need to do and here 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:32.580
 do it 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:35.400
 their wide they are at 1000 rpm they 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.140
 throw out any snow so this this 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.380
 extra load for the engine 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:41.190
 well what's new here well do it all 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.860
 such 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:48.570
 snow plows and again what can 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:54.150
 only advise it set means 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:59.130
 i see him this this here janitors 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:05:03.420
 from the janitors motor with this with 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:07.330
 gearbox this collections just well and 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:09.220
 This engine I put the stove that is 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:12.040
 not to jump there sits like 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:14.410
 works like a here and here so here 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:18.010
 I recommend you he has enough strength 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:19.840
 grabs everything in this way 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:24.970
 actually all but now we 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:26.520
 together with you and and see how he 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:30.680
 works after 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.680
 error correction 

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.280
 going out 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:52.129
 That's probably all like all works on 

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:52.129
 it will snow 

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.340
 how are we considering 

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:08.229
 the next job about the tractor and obviously 

00:07:02.949 --> 00:07:10.060
 will be a motivator for loosening the soil but 

00:07:08.229 --> 00:07:10.889
 there will be more intermediate work will 

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:14.259
 go out 

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:15.009
 show sharing your experience yes here 

00:07:14.259 --> 00:07:19.060
 even 

00:07:15.009 --> 00:07:22.919
 the gate is also kind of homemade for three years 

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:22.919
 works without fail 

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:30.030
 well that 's all good luck
