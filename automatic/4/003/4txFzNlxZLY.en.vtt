00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.080
 open the spaces do not hurry 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.280
 accelerate when they should 

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.019
 rosendo cantú 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:11.139
 and this ends up hooking ted 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:12.349
 all that football 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:13.499
 while 

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:16.499
 we think that you should play often in different 

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:20.750
 Barsa's second goal came 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.560
 they armed the play on the contrary 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.560
 to leo messi 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.130
 we need 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.130
 take out the ball and place it as the placement 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.180
 the attempt by 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.230
 amanda seyfried stressed 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.220
 others retreat 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.220
 according to although he avoided a gap and said 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.190
 Summer has arrived 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.190
 Gerard Piqué 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.230
 with the basis that to make it 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.350
 in this sense enrique 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.270
 ibra yelled at 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.270
 the also mythical rivero frames 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.780
 so they would go to rest with this 3 to 0 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.080
 the game difference 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.050
 the table and therefore added staff 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.050
 and offer permanent company 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.840
 all the times they faced each other 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.590
 r always visible 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.590
 xavier lópez chabelo 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.990
 everything is going to be lost in action, he said. 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.570
 with the foreseeable 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.660
 local and mayors 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.580
 and when the valence can exist 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.550
 for that same leg by 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.550
 despite the accident 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.340
 it is not as predictable as they say, but it is lost 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.380
 the greeting to the sky to celebrate it as it always does 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.670
 the memory of his grandmother 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.350
 17 golazo to deport him 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.450
 efecom in the tunnel 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.639
 rafael marquez and oscar serrato for this shoe sócola 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.490
 a great definition 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.530
 very good hooking bribes in the party sector was over 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.259
 the personal play the individual play 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.959
 He is very good at putting the ball 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:14.399
 likewise after 

00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:16.049
 the racing 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:19.120
 Barcelona faces and 8 percent possession of the ball 

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:23.589
 and this does not say anything when you move it minutes the problem is that a 

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:26.799
 less than half an hour of match for the opponent 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:29.799
 a huge amount of minutes in your possession 

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:32.379
 20 shots to the bow for the barza
