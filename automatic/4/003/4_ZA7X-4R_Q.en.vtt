00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
board game arenas they don't use enough

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.670 
board game arenas they don't use enough
light<00:00:18.090> when<00:00:18.779> you're<00:00:18.900> showing<00:00:19.199> something<00:00:19.439> with

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
light when you're showing something with

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.980 
light when you're showing something with
detail<00:00:20.130> like<00:00:20.520> board<00:00:20.850> game<00:00:21.060> rules<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:21.810> things

in detail you want to make sure you have

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.250 
in detail you want to make sure you have
enough<00:00:23.970> lights<00:00:24.330> people<00:00:24.750> can<00:00:24.900> see<00:00:25.050> what's

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270 
board games with Scott videos now I've

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.459 
board games with Scott videos now I've
had<00:00:33.270> two<00:00:33.480> different<00:00:33.600> lighting<00:00:33.899> solutions

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
had two different lighting solutions

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.280 
had two different lighting solutions
based<00:00:34.680> upon<00:00:35.160> where<00:00:35.579> I<00:00:35.640> lived<00:00:35.820> in<00:00:36.030> my<00:00:36.870> old<00:00:37.079> house

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
based upon where I lived in my old house

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.380 
based upon where I lived in my old house
or<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.620> shot<00:00:37.860> in<00:00:38.040> my<00:00:38.160> basement<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.790> had<00:00:39.030> an

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
or a shot in my basement it had an

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.240 
or a shot in my basement it had an
unfinished<00:00:39.719> ceiling<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.500> therefore<00:00:41.070> I<00:00:41.100> had

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
unfinished ceiling and therefore I had

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.799 
unfinished ceiling and therefore I had
lots<00:00:41.460> of<00:00:41.640> beams<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.239> what<00:00:42.360> I<00:00:42.390> did<00:00:42.600> is<00:00:42.629> I<00:00:42.780> went

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
lots of beams and what I did is I went

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.240 
lots of beams and what I did is I went
down<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.320> hardware<00:00:43.500> store<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:44.010> I<00:00:44.070> bought

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
down to the hardware store and I bought

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.180 
down to the hardware store and I bought
lights<00:00:44.550> like<00:00:44.850> these<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.930> that's<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:46.829> climb

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
lights like these and that's it climb

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.069 
lights like these and that's it climb
come<00:00:47.370> up<00:00:47.489> on<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.700> ceiling<00:00:47.879> this<00:00:48.480> was<00:00:48.719> my<00:00:48.870> light

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
come up on the ceiling this was my light

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.610 
come up on the ceiling this was my light
source<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.590> it's<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.550> little<00:00:50.760> instrument<00:00:51.030> to

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
source and it's a little instrument to

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.590 
source and it's a little instrument to
the<00:00:52.620> way<00:00:52.800> that<00:00:53.190> you<00:00:53.699> position<00:00:54.000> your<00:00:54.300> lights

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
the way that you position your lights

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.630 
the way that you position your lights
basic<00:00:55.140> video<00:00:55.320> lighting<00:00:55.680> is<00:00:55.949> three<00:00:56.399> light

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
basic video lighting is three light

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.569 
basic video lighting is three light
sources<00:00:57.320> you<00:00:58.320> have<00:00:58.469> your<00:00:58.620> key<00:00:58.980> light<00:00:59.190> or<00:00:59.460> your

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
sources you have your key light or your

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.400 
sources you have your key light or your
main<00:00:59.850> light<00:01:00.059> your<00:01:00.570> key<00:01:00.780> light<00:01:00.960> needs<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.289> be

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
main light your key light needs to be

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.170 
main light your key light needs to be
somewhere<00:01:01.890> over<00:01:02.340> there<00:01:02.460> effect<00:01:02.820> I'm<00:01:02.940> pointing

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
somewhere over there effect I'm pointing

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.850 
somewhere over there effect I'm pointing
right<00:01:03.390> now<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.629> my<00:01:03.930> key<00:01:04.199> light<00:01:04.229> that<00:01:04.589> I<00:01:04.619> use<00:01:04.830> for

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
right now to my key light that I use for

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.039 
right now to my key light that I use for
these<00:01:05.100> little<00:01:05.400> videos<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:06.000> so<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.720> idea<00:01:06.840> of

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
these little videos and so the idea of

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.929 
these little videos and so the idea of
the<00:01:07.110> key<00:01:07.409> light<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:08.189> can<00:01:08.310> see<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.520> reflection

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
the key light you can see the reflection

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.219 
the key light you can see the reflection
over<00:01:09.119> my<00:01:09.299> glasses<00:01:09.540> I'll<00:01:09.840> talk<00:01:09.990> about<00:01:10.020> that

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
over my glasses I'll talk about that

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.429 
over my glasses I'll talk about that
later<00:01:10.580> the<00:01:11.580> key<00:01:11.909> light<00:01:12.180> needs<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:13.049> be<00:01:13.170> over<00:01:13.350> to

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
later the key light needs to be over to

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.230 
later the key light needs to be over to
the<00:01:13.530> side<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:13.950> up<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.369> little<00:01:14.850> bit<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.150> that

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
the side and up a little bit and that

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.280 
the side and up a little bit and that
should<00:01:15.390> be<00:01:15.450> your<00:01:15.540> brightest<00:01:15.900> light<00:01:16.049> source

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
should be your brightest light source

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.080 
should be your brightest light source
second<00:01:17.130> thing<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:17.250> want<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.490> have<00:01:17.580> as<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.670> fill

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
second thing you want to have as a fill

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.760 
second thing you want to have as a fill
light<00:01:18.119> now<00:01:18.630> fill<00:01:19.020> light<00:01:19.229> is<00:01:19.380> going<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.590> be<00:01:19.650> on

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
light now fill light is going to be on

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.140 
light now fill light is going to be on
the<00:01:19.860> other<00:01:20.040> side<00:01:20.340> of<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.490> camera<00:01:20.790> from<00:01:21.030> the

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
the other side of the camera from the

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.820 
the other side of the camera from the
key<00:01:21.360> light<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.810> it<00:01:22.049> helps<00:01:22.259> fill<00:01:22.470> in<00:01:22.619> some<00:01:22.770> of

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
key light and it helps fill in some of

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.969 
key light and it helps fill in some of
the<00:01:23.009> details<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:23.880> go<00:01:24.210> away<00:01:24.750> when<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:25.799> have

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
the details that go away when you have

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.649 
the details that go away when you have
the<00:01:26.100> shadows<00:01:26.549> from<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.880> key<00:01:27.090> light<00:01:27.270> so<00:01:27.600> you

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
the shadows from the key light so you

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.780 
the shadows from the key light so you
have<00:01:27.869> main<00:01:28.320> key<00:01:28.590> light<00:01:28.770> up<00:01:28.950> here<00:01:29.159> you<00:01:29.640> have<00:01:29.759> a

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
have main key light up here you have a

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.340 
have main key light up here you have a
fill<00:01:30.119> light<00:01:30.150> that's<00:01:30.600> kind<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:30.869> over<00:01:31.079> on<00:01:31.170> this

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
fill light that's kind of over on this

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.380 
fill light that's kind of over on this
side<00:01:31.409> helping<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.460> fill<00:01:32.640> shadows<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.240> then

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
side helping to fill shadows and then

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.660 
side helping to fill shadows and then
you<00:01:33.540> have<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.780> backline<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.590> backlight<00:01:35.040> helps

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
you have a backline the backlight helps

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.249 
you have a backline the backlight helps
to<00:01:35.790> fill<00:01:35.970> out<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.270> background<00:01:36.840> so<00:01:37.229> that

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
to fill out the background so that

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.140 
to fill out the background so that
there's<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.799> third<00:01:38.070> dimension<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.700> your<00:01:38.729> shot

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
there's a third dimension to your shot

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.300 
there's a third dimension to your shot
if<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:39.780> can't<00:01:40.110> see<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.439> background<00:01:40.770> then<00:01:41.280> a

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
if you can't see a background then a

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.850 
if you can't see a background then a
person<00:01:41.759> is<00:01:41.880> fairly<00:01:42.119> flat<00:01:42.450> so<00:01:43.140> when<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:43.710> do

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
person is fairly flat so when you do

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:44.840 
person is fairly flat so when you do
your<00:01:44.040> lighting<00:01:44.340> you<00:01:44.430> want<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:44.640> think<00:01:44.729> about

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
your lighting you want to think about

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.120 
your lighting you want to think about
three<00:01:45.180> sources<00:01:45.479> main<00:01:45.869> light<00:01:46.079> up<00:01:46.229> there<00:01:46.439> fill

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
three sources main light up there fill

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.950 
three sources main light up there fill
light<00:01:47.310> over<00:01:47.549> there<00:01:47.700> and<00:01:47.909> then<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.390> backlight

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
light over there and then a backlight

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:49.969 
light over there and then a backlight
the<00:01:49.079> one<00:01:49.170> thing<00:01:49.290> I<00:01:49.350> don't<00:01:49.409> have<00:01:49.649> in<00:01:49.890> this

than<00:02:09.629> it<00:02:09.720> recommends<00:02:10.229> but<00:02:10.379> I<00:02:10.679> usually<00:02:10.830> went<00:02:11.129> up

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
than it recommends but I usually went up

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.540 
than it recommends but I usually went up
to<00:02:11.489> whatever<00:02:11.730> it<00:02:12.000> recommended

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550

these<00:02:12.880> things<00:02:13.030> do<00:02:13.240> get<00:02:13.360> hot<00:02:13.600> so<00:02:13.780> you<00:02:13.840> want<00:02:13.990> to

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
these things do get hot so you want to

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.200 
these things do get hot so you want to
be<00:02:14.080> careful<00:02:14.380> of<00:02:14.650> that<00:02:14.850> and<00:02:15.850> you<00:02:15.970> can<00:02:16.090> use

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
be careful of that and you can use

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:17.970 
be careful of that and you can use
multiple<00:02:16.630> ones<00:02:16.810> I<00:02:16.960> think<00:02:17.140> in<00:02:17.260> my<00:02:17.350> basement<00:02:17.590> I

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
multiple ones I think in my basement I

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.860 
multiple ones I think in my basement I
was<00:02:18.370> actually<00:02:18.550> using<00:02:18.940> six<00:02:19.180> or<00:02:19.330> seven<00:02:19.660> of<00:02:19.720> these

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
was actually using six or seven of these

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.740 
was actually using six or seven of these
spread<00:02:20.320> around<00:02:20.410> in<00:02:20.650> different<00:02:20.770> areas<00:02:21.220> now<00:02:22.000> in

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
spread around in different areas now in

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.810 
spread around in different areas now in
my<00:02:22.990> new<00:02:23.170> house<00:02:23.440> though<00:02:23.830> I<00:02:24.070> film<00:02:24.490> in<00:02:24.640> a<00:02:24.700> room

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
my new house though I film in a room

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.040 
my new house though I film in a room
with<00:02:24.910> a<00:02:25.000> finished<00:02:25.330> ceiling<00:02:25.630> so<00:02:25.780> there<00:02:25.900> aren't

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
with a finished ceiling so there aren't

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.900 
with a finished ceiling so there aren't
all<00:02:26.470> these<00:02:26.680> nice<00:02:26.890> beams<00:02:27.190> to<00:02:27.430> clamp<00:02:27.640> things

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
all these nice beams to clamp things

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.700 
all these nice beams to clamp things
onto<00:02:28.060> so<00:02:28.450> what<00:02:28.600> I<00:02:28.630> did<00:02:28.720> is<00:02:28.840> I<00:02:29.050> installed<00:02:29.410> track

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 
onto so what I did is I installed track

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.830 
onto so what I did is I installed track
lighting<00:02:29.950> I<00:02:30.220> guess<00:02:30.940> old-fashioned<00:02:31.630> track

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
lighting I guess old-fashioned track

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.030 
lighting I guess old-fashioned track
lighting<00:02:32.080> and<00:02:32.290> when<00:02:32.380> I<00:02:32.410> have<00:02:32.680> our<00:02:32.830> nice<00:02:32.980> little

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
lighting and when I have our nice little

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.130 
lighting and when I have our nice little
halogen<00:02:33.790> lights<00:02:34.000> that<00:02:34.540> when<00:02:34.660> I'm<00:02:34.780> going<00:02:34.900> to<00:02:34.960> do

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
halogen lights that when I'm going to do

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.530 
halogen lights that when I'm going to do
a<00:02:35.170> film<00:02:35.590> i<00:02:35.830> plug<00:02:36.400> in<00:02:36.670> these<00:02:36.850> halogen<00:02:37.360> lights

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
a film i plug in these halogen lights

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.660 
a film i plug in these halogen lights
and<00:02:37.720> I<00:02:37.750> plug<00:02:37.990> in<00:02:38.020> 5<00:02:38.440> halogen<00:02:39.070> lights<00:02:39.280> along<00:02:39.490> the

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
and I plug in 5 halogen lights along the

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.150 
and I plug in 5 halogen lights along the
track<00:02:39.880> and<00:02:40.090> point<00:02:40.300> them<00:02:40.980> several<00:02:41.980> them

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
track and point them several them

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.040 
track and point them several them
together<00:02:42.400> to<00:02:42.490> make<00:02:42.580> the<00:02:43.000> main<00:02:43.150> light<00:02:43.330> a<00:02:43.510> couple

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
together to make the main light a couple

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.020 
together to make the main light a couple
to<00:02:44.110> make<00:02:44.260> the<00:02:44.380> fill<00:02:44.560> light<00:02:44.740> and<00:02:44.950> then<00:02:45.340> again<00:02:46.000> I

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
to make the fill light and then again I

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.610 
to make the fill light and then again I
use<00:02:46.240> an<00:02:46.510> overhead<00:02:46.870> light<00:02:47.050> just<00:02:47.260> to<00:02:47.380> give<00:02:47.500> me

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
use an overhead light just to give me

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.540 
use an overhead light just to give me
the<00:02:48.000> background<00:02:49.000> lighting<00:02:49.210> if<00:02:50.250> you<00:02:51.250> don't

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
the background lighting if you don't

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.640 
the background lighting if you don't
want<00:02:52.090> to<00:02:52.180> install<00:02:52.540> something<00:02:53.050> and<00:02:53.410> you<00:02:53.470> have<00:02:53.620> a

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
want to install something and you have a

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.320 
want to install something and you have a
finished<00:02:53.920> ceiling<00:02:54.340> you<00:02:54.460> could<00:02:54.640> get<00:02:54.820> you<00:02:55.180> need

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
finished ceiling you could get you need

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:56.760 
finished ceiling you could get you need
something<00:02:55.660> to<00:02:55.720> clamp<00:02:56.050> these<00:02:56.260> clamp<00:02:56.560> lights

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
something to clamp these clamp lights

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.370 
something to clamp these clamp lights
onto<00:02:56.980> a<00:02:57.460> ladder<00:02:58.300> the<00:02:58.660> ladder<00:02:58.690> would<00:02:59.080> be<00:02:59.170> fine

just need something to clamp it on to
that's<00:03:06.820> pretty<00:03:07.060> easy<00:03:07.120> now<00:03:07.930> one<00:03:08.680> thing<00:03:08.710> to

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
that's pretty easy now one thing to

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.980 
that's pretty easy now one thing to
think<00:03:09.160> about<00:03:09.250> is<00:03:09.580> glare<00:03:09.910> for<00:03:10.600> these<00:03:10.720> little

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:10.990 
think about is glare for these little

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.360 
think about is glare for these little
videos<00:03:11.110> i'm<00:03:11.440> using<00:03:11.710> a<00:03:11.770> light<00:03:11.920> that's<00:03:12.130> right

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
videos i'm using a light that's right

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.790 
videos i'm using a light that's right
there<00:03:12.790> I<00:03:12.820> can<00:03:12.940> touch<00:03:13.090> it<00:03:13.270> and<00:03:13.540> so<00:03:14.320> what<00:03:14.470> happens

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
there I can touch it and so what happens

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.050 
there I can touch it and so what happens
is<00:03:14.920> you<00:03:15.010> get<00:03:15.100> this<00:03:15.250> little<00:03:15.400> spot<00:03:15.670> of<00:03:15.730> glare

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
is you get this little spot of glare

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.850 
is you get this little spot of glare
because<00:03:16.300> i<00:03:16.360> haven't<00:03:16.570> softened<00:03:17.320> the<00:03:17.680> light

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
because i haven't softened the light

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.710 
because i haven't softened the light
haven't<00:03:18.700> spent<00:03:18.880> much<00:03:18.970> time<00:03:19.120> doing<00:03:19.510> that

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
haven't spent much time doing that

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.479 
haven't spent much time doing that
there's<00:03:20.050> a<00:03:20.110> few<00:03:20.320> ways<00:03:20.440> to<00:03:20.500> do<00:03:20.890> that<00:03:21.040> the

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
there's a few ways to do that the

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.790 
there's a few ways to do that the
easiest<00:03:21.730> way<00:03:22.090> to<00:03:22.150> soften<00:03:22.450> like<00:03:22.840> is<00:03:23.050> to<00:03:23.560> turn

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
easiest way to soften like is to turn

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.130 
easiest way to soften like is to turn
the<00:03:23.920> line<00:03:24.100> around<00:03:24.459> and<00:03:24.850> point<00:03:25.209> it<00:03:25.300> onto<00:03:25.900> a

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
the line around and point it onto a

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.610 
the line around and point it onto a
white<00:03:27.130> poster<00:03:27.730> board<00:03:27.760> or<00:03:28.350> some<00:03:29.350> sort<00:03:29.470> of<00:03:29.530> a

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
white poster board or some sort of a

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.500 
white poster board or some sort of a
white<00:03:29.800> met<00:03:30.070> board<00:03:30.370> and<00:03:30.580> then<00:03:30.760> the<00:03:31.000> whiteboard

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
white met board and then the whiteboard

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.600 
white met board and then the whiteboard
reflects<00:03:32.020> the<00:03:32.530> light<00:03:32.709> so<00:03:33.160> it's<00:03:33.310> not<00:03:33.459> this

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
reflects the light so it's not this

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.670 
reflects the light so it's not this
direct<00:03:34.000> spot<00:03:34.360> instead<00:03:34.930> it's<00:03:35.110> a<00:03:35.170> reflective

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
direct spot instead it's a reflective

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.500 
direct spot instead it's a reflective
light<00:03:35.890> that's<00:03:36.489> pretty<00:03:36.820> the<00:03:36.970> easiest<00:03:37.360> and

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
light that's pretty the easiest and

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.479 
light that's pretty the easiest and
cheapest<00:03:37.870> thing<00:03:38.110> to<00:03:38.290> do<00:03:38.440> so<00:03:38.709> again<00:03:38.980> you<00:03:39.370> can

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
cheapest thing to do so again you can

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:40.440 
cheapest thing to do so again you can
also<00:03:39.610> bounced<00:03:39.880> it<00:03:40.060> if<00:03:40.150> you<00:03:40.209> have<00:03:40.300> white

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
also bounced it if you have white

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:41.729 
also bounced it if you have white
ceiling<00:03:40.690> bounce<00:03:40.989> it<00:03:41.110> off<00:03:41.170> the<00:03:41.350> white<00:03:41.470> ceiling

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
ceiling bounce it off the white ceiling

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:44.280 
ceiling bounce it off the white ceiling
bounce<00:03:42.310> it<00:03:42.430> off<00:03:42.520> a<00:03:42.580> white<00:03:42.820> wall<00:03:43.030> so<00:03:43.900> the<00:03:44.170> idea

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
bounce it off a white wall so the idea

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.870 
bounce it off a white wall so the idea
is<00:03:44.560> that<00:03:44.709> you<00:03:44.950> want<00:03:45.100> to<00:03:45.130> soften<00:03:45.370> the<00:03:45.670> light<00:03:45.820> a

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
is that you want to soften the light a

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.460 
is that you want to soften the light a
little<00:03:46.030> bit<00:03:46.450> so<00:03:46.600> it's<00:03:46.690> not<00:03:46.870> quite<00:03:47.080> so<00:03:47.230> direct

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
little bit so it's not quite so direct

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.490 
little bit so it's not quite so direct

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:29.409 
more importantly as you can see what
they<00:04:27.440> have<00:04:27.680> is<00:04:27.949> a<00:04:28.009> reflective<00:04:28.699> surface<00:04:28.729> on<00:04:29.330> the

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:29.419 
they have is a reflective surface on the

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:31.689 
they have is a reflective surface on the
back<00:04:29.600> and<00:04:29.810> so<00:04:30.259> you<00:04:30.380> clamp<00:04:30.830> this<00:04:31.100> you<00:04:31.340> point<00:04:31.610> the

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:31.699 
back and so you clamp this you point the

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:33.189 
back and so you clamp this you point the
light<00:04:31.850> into<00:04:32.270> it<00:04:32.389> and<00:04:32.509> it<00:04:32.630> reflects<00:04:32.930> the<00:04:33.080> light

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:33.199 
light into it and it reflects the light

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:35.170 
light into it and it reflects the light
out<00:04:33.380> now<00:04:33.979> the<00:04:34.039> nice<00:04:34.370> thing<00:04:34.400> about<00:04:34.639> this<00:04:34.970> sort

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
out now the nice thing about this sort

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.360 
out now the nice thing about this sort
of<00:04:35.300> thing<00:04:35.360> is<00:04:35.750> that<00:04:36.020> you<00:04:36.530> can<00:04:36.560> make<00:04:37.160> your<00:04:37.310> own

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
of thing is that you can make your own

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.129 
of thing is that you can make your own
all<00:04:37.820> you<00:04:38.060> need<00:04:38.180> is<00:04:38.300> an<00:04:38.419> umbrella<00:04:38.690> and<00:04:39.080> some

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
aluminum foil you get sheets of aluminum

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.439 
aluminum foil you get sheets of aluminum
foil<00:04:42.289> cut<00:04:42.590> them<00:04:42.740> in<00:04:42.830> long<00:04:43.039> strips<00:04:43.820> that<00:04:44.090> taper

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:44.449 
foil cut them in long strips that taper

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:46.960 
foil cut them in long strips that taper
down<00:04:44.630> to<00:04:44.930> a<00:04:44.960> point<00:04:45.289> line<00:04:45.949> the<00:04:46.220> inside<00:04:46.250> with<00:04:46.820> it

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
down to a point line the inside with it

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.570 
down to a point line the inside with it
tape<00:04:47.539> back<00:04:47.810> soil<00:04:48.229> down<00:04:48.530> to<00:04:48.919> the<00:04:49.130> umbrella<00:04:49.430> and

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
tape back soil down to the umbrella and

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.629 
tape back soil down to the umbrella and
there<00:04:49.699> you<00:04:49.820> go<00:04:49.970> you<00:04:50.030> got<00:04:50.210> your<00:04:50.539> homemade

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:51.639 
there you go you got your homemade

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:54.879 
there you go you got your homemade
reflector<00:04:52.639> so<00:04:53.030> now<00:04:53.960> if<00:04:54.259> you<00:04:54.440> start<00:04:54.650> looking<00:04:54.740> at

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:54.889 
reflector so now if you start looking at

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:56.140 
reflector so now if you start looking at
professional<00:04:55.190> lighting<00:04:55.520> kits<00:04:55.820> you'll<00:04:56.000> see

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
professional lighting kits you'll see

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:57.310 
professional lighting kits you'll see
you<00:04:56.270> can<00:04:56.300> spend<00:04:56.630> lots<00:04:56.810> and<00:04:56.930> lots<00:04:57.050> and<00:04:57.110> lots<00:04:57.199> and

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.320 
you can spend lots and lots and lots and

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.439 
you can spend lots and lots and lots and
lots<00:04:57.410> of<00:04:57.590> lots<00:04:57.830> of<00:04:58.099> money<00:04:58.280> on<00:04:58.550> this<00:04:59.210> but

00:04:59.439 --> 00:04:59.449 
lots of lots of money on this but

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:02.320 
lots of lots of money on this but
reality<00:05:00.080> is<00:05:00.349> just<00:05:01.190> get<00:05:01.430> a<00:05:01.460> light<00:05:01.699> on<00:05:01.910> you<00:05:02.150> and

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
reality is just get a light on you and

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.120 
reality is just get a light on you and
it's<00:05:02.900> too<00:05:03.110> many<00:05:03.259> people<00:05:03.560> make<00:05:03.680> videos<00:05:04.039> they

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
it's too many people make videos they

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.040 
it's too many people make videos they
don't<00:05:04.280> even<00:05:04.490> do<00:05:04.610> some<00:05:05.000> basic<00:05:05.270> light<00:05:05.660> pointing

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
don't even do some basic light pointing

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.600 
don't even do some basic light pointing
at<00:05:06.110> their<00:05:06.259> face<00:05:06.470> in<00:05:07.009> this<00:05:07.130> case<00:05:07.370> i'm<00:05:07.580> using

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
at their face in this case i'm using

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.070 
at their face in this case i'm using
it's<00:05:07.940> a<00:05:07.970> little<00:05:08.120> desk<00:05:08.300> lamp<00:05:08.570> if<00:05:08.720> i<00:05:08.780> didn't<00:05:09.050> have

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
it's a little desk lamp if i didn't have

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.640 
it's a little desk lamp if i didn't have
it<00:05:09.380> as<00:05:10.300> you<00:05:11.300> can<00:05:11.449> see<00:05:11.570> my<00:05:11.720> camera<00:05:12.110> will<00:05:12.289> do<00:05:12.530> its

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
it as you can see my camera will do its

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.409 
it as you can see my camera will do its
best<00:05:12.740> the<00:05:13.370> other<00:05:13.490> thing<00:05:13.639> I'm<00:05:13.759> doing<00:05:13.789> is<00:05:14.090> I<00:05:14.210> turn

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:14.419 
best the other thing I'm doing is I turn

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:16.870 
best the other thing I'm doing is I turn
off<00:05:14.449> my<00:05:14.750> main<00:05:14.990> monitor<00:05:15.520> sometimes<00:05:16.520> I<00:05:16.729> forget

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
off my main monitor sometimes I forget

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:18.310 
off my main monitor sometimes I forget
that<00:05:17.060> and<00:05:17.419> you<00:05:17.479> can<00:05:17.599> see<00:05:17.720> the<00:05:17.810> reflection<00:05:18.229> of

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320 
that and you can see the reflection of

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.710 
that and you can see the reflection of
them<00:05:18.500> in<00:05:18.650> my<00:05:18.919> glasses<00:05:19.220> but<00:05:20.090> so<00:05:20.449> now<00:05:20.660> the

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 
them in my glasses but so now the

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.180 
them in my glasses but so now the
monitor<00:05:21.080> is<00:05:21.139> on<00:05:21.289> it<00:05:21.500> gives<00:05:21.620> me<00:05:21.710> a<00:05:21.770> blue<00:05:21.979> tint

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:22.190 
monitor is on it gives me a blue tint

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.279 
monitor is on it gives me a blue tint
and<00:05:22.310> you<00:05:22.370> can<00:05:22.550> see<00:05:22.820> the<00:05:23.030> reflection<00:05:23.599> in<00:05:23.750> my

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:24.289 
and you can see the reflection in my

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:26.680 
and you can see the reflection in my
glasses<00:05:24.590> of<00:05:24.949> the<00:05:25.190> monitor<00:05:25.580> with<00:05:26.300> my<00:05:26.479> little

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690 
glasses of the monitor with my little

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.240 
glasses of the monitor with my little
light<00:05:26.930> back<00:05:27.110> on<00:05:27.259> that<00:05:27.500> helps<00:05:27.830> a<00:05:27.919> little<00:05:28.070> bit

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.250 
light back on that helps a little bit

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:29.950 
light back on that helps a little bit
but<00:05:28.460> sometimes<00:05:28.970> that's<00:05:29.479> something<00:05:29.780> else<00:05:29.840> to

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
but sometimes that's something else to

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.540 
but sometimes that's something else to
remembers<00:05:30.380> to<00:05:30.470> turn<00:05:30.650> off<00:05:30.830> that<00:05:30.979> monitor<00:05:31.220> light

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
remembers to turn off that monitor light

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.000 
remembers to turn off that monitor light
source<00:05:31.789> because<00:05:31.940> it's<00:05:32.090> not<00:05:32.210> very<00:05:32.389> pretty<00:05:32.740> so<00:05:33.740> I

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.010 
source because it's not very pretty so I

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:35.980 
source because it's not very pretty so I
think<00:05:34.280> I've<00:05:34.490> babbled<00:05:34.880> on<00:05:34.970> enough<00:05:35.270> about<00:05:35.479> basic

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:35.990 
think I've babbled on enough about basic

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.320 
think I've babbled on enough about basic
basic<00:05:36.169> basic<00:05:36.349> lighting<00:05:36.830> the<00:05:37.370> biggest<00:05:37.940> tip<00:05:38.210> I

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330 
basic basic lighting the biggest tip I

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:39.850 
basic basic lighting the biggest tip I
would<00:05:38.449> give<00:05:38.599> is<00:05:38.780> these<00:05:39.020> are<00:05:39.050> six<00:05:39.470> seven<00:05:39.800> eight

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:39.860 
would give is these are six seven eight

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.159 
would give is these are six seven eight
bucks<00:05:40.130> at<00:05:40.520> your<00:05:40.729> local<00:05:40.849> hardware<00:05:40.970> store<00:05:41.419> get<00:05:42.020> a

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:42.169 
bucks at your local hardware store get a

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:44.529 
bucks at your local hardware store get a
handful<00:05:43.039> of<00:05:43.099> them<00:05:43.340> you'll<00:05:44.090> probably<00:05:44.270> want<00:05:44.479> at

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:44.539 
handful of them you'll probably want at

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:47.200 
handful of them you'll probably want at
least<00:05:44.599> three<00:05:44.840> of<00:05:45.169> them<00:05:45.320> maybe<00:05:46.070> I<00:05:46.460> usually<00:05:46.940> have

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.210 
least three of them maybe I usually have

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:48.909 
least three of them maybe I usually have
four<00:05:47.750> or<00:05:47.840> five<00:05:47.990> but<00:05:48.260> I<00:05:48.289> had<00:05:48.500> the<00:05:48.590> lighting<00:05:48.889> a

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:48.919 
four or five but I had the lighting a

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:51.310 
four or five but I had the lighting a
ways<00:05:49.310> away<00:05:49.340> from<00:05:49.669> me<00:05:49.970> and<00:05:50.150> use<00:05:50.810> these<00:05:51.020> when<00:05:51.229> you

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:51.320 
ways away from me and use these when you

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.080 
ways away from me and use these when you
make<00:05:51.500> your<00:05:51.530> videos<00:05:52.039> and<00:05:52.070> you'll<00:05:52.400> find<00:05:52.669> that

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:53.090 
make your videos and you'll find that

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.330 
make your videos and you'll find that
the<00:05:53.389> quality<00:05:53.690> that<00:05:53.930> color<00:05:54.380> the<00:05:54.620> detail<00:05:55.009> it<00:05:55.190> all

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:55.340 
the quality that color the detail it all

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.330 
the quality that color the detail it all
comes<00:05:55.610> out<00:05:55.789> much<00:05:56.090> more<00:05:56.509> effective<00:05:56.930> so<00:05:57.650> that's

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:58.340 
comes out much more effective so that's
