 plus a speedtest streak this time here 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.000
 with the Osiris against the prop you do not 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.369
 We saw a playlist below with all 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.850
 speedtest races they seat around 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.620
 the entity and now it is the turn of the 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.379
 we are the church we are so far 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.559
 simply the second fastest car 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.719
 of the game is like this and now it 's the 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.719
 Let 's see if he'll win here. 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.030
 This is going to be our 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.090
 evaluated in sadc will be able to 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.800
 adler that until now would be the most 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.539
 You must be fast from everything. 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.239
 asking the simple is what gives a 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.989
 car new update dirty money 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.239
 so come on 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.769
 remembering that ours the circuit has a 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.780
 kilometer and a half because another 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:12.240
 kilometer and a half is a 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.220
 circuit is practically straight and we do not 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.259
 we will still pay 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.750
 other long bandung stops of the show 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.310
 Can not stop like you saw here. 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.590
 today it came out in front of our 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.899
 structure someone with new green from our 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.239
 friend felipe orro connection more 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:29.489
 apparently even leaving 

00:01:27.239 --> 00:01:32.759
 it is simply the most 

00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:34.319
 quick game advent then resuming the 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.069
 line speed was owned by 

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:39.750
 final and a lot of fuck you can 

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:42.450
 leave a leak in the head 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.090
 anyway it will not look like it will not 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.729
 to the area then 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.590
 Osiris is simply the most 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.479
 fast then the first half is early 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.310
 to talk we will play the second part 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.530

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.540
 fastest car in gta history 5 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.820
 that this would be really fuck it was time 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.250

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:13.330
 that I would not catch me cheating are 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:18.910
 ferrari cars here at gta then a 32 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:21.370
 67 68 32 832 is a slight difference but 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.530
 It's a difference then it's meant to be told. 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.040
 or using everything here I'll be back with 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.040
 you 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.850
 we'll be back here guys with the second 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.769
 partial now to see if it stays that is 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.100
 consecrated history's fastest car 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:38.500
 So I'm very excited here. 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.360
 in this speedtest ray of the eye now I go 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.070
 wait for the good wishes of Felipe and I 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.870
 take care of a player reminding the channel of the 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.610
 movie that will still be the description of the 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.319
 life the kick and microphone 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.450
 come on then let's go let's go 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.980
 1 counting right here philippines and 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.600
 speeding up so you do not arrive early 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.030
 also did not take too long to 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.549
 look for this cart then say that 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.950
 it would be if the area let's go 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:02.140
 you saw more life including 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.150
 much stronger start up 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.890
 in this case, it 's too bad the student does not have 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.560
 lame so good 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.340
 but the average final speed of the year 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.620
 end there 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.530
 maybe another circuit would be of two 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:17.320
 kilometers for 1 to 0 and get out 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.630
 simply search for plants but let's go 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:22.570

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:25.090
