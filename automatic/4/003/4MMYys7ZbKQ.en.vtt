00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
subscribers and it's a lot easier to

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.180 
subscribers and it's a lot easier to
just<00:00:42.390> roll<00:00:42.840> on<00:00:43.140> kids<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.530> pubstomp<00:00:43.920> with

her decision yet she's not um fully

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:44.370 
her decision yet she's not um fully
developed<00:05:43.270> you<00:05:43.509> have<00:05:43.539> not<00:05:43.900> made<00:05:44.050> her<00:05:44.169> decision
