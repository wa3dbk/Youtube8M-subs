00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
one just one down here and this one and

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.670 
one just one down here and this one and

you'll have to take it on plug the wires

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.230 
you'll have to take it on plug the wires
for<00:01:47.220> their<00:01:47.659> board<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:49.080> your<00:01:49.650> speaker<00:01:50.240> and

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
for their board and your speaker and

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.649 
for their board and your speaker and
this<00:01:51.840> just<00:01:53.600> you've<00:01:54.600> lift<00:01:54.900> it<00:01:55.080> up<00:01:56.330> and<00:01:57.330> it<00:01:57.510> comes

do is make sure you lay it flat
somewhere<00:02:09.649> I<00:02:09.950> know<00:02:10.910> I'm<00:02:11.120> gonna<00:02:11.210> take<00:02:11.360> the

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
somewhere I know I'm gonna take the

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.970 
somewhere I know I'm gonna take the
boards<00:02:11.870> off<00:02:11.990> the<00:02:12.050> back<00:02:13.450> lay<00:02:14.450> it<00:02:14.600> flat<00:02:14.980> take

boards off the back lay it flat take
screws<00:02:16.430> off<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:16.850> front<00:02:17.209> and<00:02:18.070> this<00:02:19.070> metal

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
screws off the front and this metal

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.780 
screws off the front and this metal
piece<00:02:19.670> here<00:02:20.060> comes<00:02:20.450> off<00:02:21.010> and<00:02:22.010> then<00:02:22.190> your<00:02:22.370> glass

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
piece here comes off and then your glass

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.160 
piece here comes off and then your glass
piece<00:02:23.300> here<00:02:23.870> is<00:02:24.350> actually<00:02:24.830> LCD<00:02:25.550> part<00:02:25.990> you<00:02:26.990> can

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
piece here is actually LCD part you can

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.250 
piece here is actually LCD part you can
lift<00:02:27.380> that<00:02:27.470> up<00:02:27.830> and<00:02:28.570> make<00:02:29.570> sure<00:02:29.600> you<00:02:29.900> get<00:02:30.080> all

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
lift that up and make sure you get all

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.720 
lift that up and make sure you get all
your<00:02:30.530> other<00:02:30.740> bores<00:02:31.070> taken<00:02:31.640> off<00:02:31.820> first<00:02:32.480> and

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
your other bores taken off first and

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.440 
your other bores taken off first and
then<00:02:34.730> we'll<00:02:34.880> get<00:02:35.060> to<00:02:35.209> that<00:02:37.030> once<00:02:38.030> you<00:02:38.150> get<00:02:38.300> the

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
then we'll get to that once you get the

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.620 
then we'll get to that once you get the
base<00:02:38.630> off<00:02:39.190> then<00:02:40.190> you<00:02:40.310> have<00:02:40.550> a<00:02:40.970> couple<00:02:41.480> of

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
base off then you have a couple of

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.050 
base off then you have a couple of
screws<00:02:41.959> around<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.560> edge<00:02:42.730> that<00:02:43.730> you<00:02:43.850> get<00:02:43.970> to

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
screws around the edge that you get to

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.920 
screws around the edge that you get to
take<00:02:44.209> apart<00:02:44.570> and<00:02:45.520> in<00:02:46.520> order<00:02:46.790> to<00:02:46.820> get<00:02:47.030> behind

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
cable that connects the boards to the

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.610 
cable that connects the boards to the
screen<00:03:03.310> we'll<00:03:04.310> get<00:03:04.459> to<00:03:04.580> that<00:03:04.610> in<00:03:04.790> a<00:03:05.000> second

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
screen we'll get to that in a second

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.729 
screen we'll get to that in a second
take<00:03:06.620> your<00:03:06.799> screws<00:03:07.070> off<00:03:07.280> next<00:03:08.500> once<00:03:09.500> you<00:03:09.620> get
