I'm<00:02:18.000> apple-shaped

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
I'm apple-shaped

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.410 
I'm apple-shaped
genetics<00:02:19.290> so<00:02:19.950> I<00:02:20.280> really<00:02:20.819> wanted<00:02:21.060> to<00:02:21.150> do

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
genetics so I really wanted to do

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.690 
genetics so I really wanted to do
anything<00:02:21.659> I<00:02:21.840> could<00:02:21.900> to<00:02:22.049> reduce<00:02:22.290> it<00:02:22.769> um<00:02:23.640> I

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
anything I could to reduce it um I

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.819 
anything I could to reduce it um I
noticed<00:02:24.540> that<00:02:25.049> the<00:02:25.290> skin<00:02:25.769> got<00:02:26.250> kind<00:02:26.819> of<00:02:27.829> floppy

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:28.829 
noticed that the skin got kind of floppy

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:31.580 
noticed that the skin got kind of floppy
like<00:02:29.310> it<00:02:29.790> did<00:02:30.180> seem<00:02:30.569> like<00:02:30.629> something<00:02:31.439> was

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
like it did seem like something was

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.860 
like it did seem like something was
happening<00:02:31.769> like<00:02:32.310> this<00:02:32.640> they<00:02:33.269> say<00:02:33.540> that<00:02:33.750> the

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
happening like this they say that the

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.630 
happening like this they say that the
cells<00:02:34.109> are<00:02:34.260> meant<00:02:34.470> to<00:02:34.530> shrink<00:02:34.890> your<00:02:35.159> fat<00:02:35.220> cells

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
cells are meant to shrink your fat cells

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.729 
cells are meant to shrink your fat cells
are<00:02:35.730> meant<00:02:35.909> to<00:02:35.939> shrink<00:02:36.299> and<00:02:36.510> definitely<00:02:37.470> it

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
are meant to shrink and definitely it

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.839 
are meant to shrink and definitely it
was<00:02:37.890> much<00:02:38.489> more<00:02:38.790> wobbly<00:02:39.599> and<00:02:39.870> floppy<00:02:40.849> after

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
was much more wobbly and floppy after

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.929 
was much more wobbly and floppy after
each<00:02:42.030> session<00:02:42.680> but<00:02:43.680> ultimately<00:02:44.159> the<00:02:44.430> results

00:02:44.929 --> 00:02:44.939 
each session but ultimately the results

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:47.629 
each session but ultimately the results
my<00:02:45.569> first<00:02:45.810> measurement<00:02:46.439> versus<00:02:47.099> my<00:02:47.340> last

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:47.639 
my first measurement versus my last

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:50.179 
my first measurement versus my last
measurement<00:02:48.269> I<00:02:48.420> lost<00:02:49.170> three<00:02:49.439> centimeters

00:02:50.179 --> 00:02:50.189 
measurement I lost three centimeters

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:54.379 
measurement I lost three centimeters
which<00:02:50.970> apparently<00:02:51.569> is<00:02:51.900> good<00:02:52.169> but<00:02:53.129> for<00:02:53.430> me<00:02:53.609> it

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:54.389 
which apparently is good but for me it

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:56.420 
which apparently is good but for me it
has<00:02:54.450> made<00:02:54.599> absolutely<00:02:55.349> no<00:02:55.439> difference<00:02:56.040> in<00:02:56.220> the

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
has made absolutely no difference in the

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.050 
has made absolutely no difference in the
appearance<00:02:56.760> of<00:02:57.209> my<00:02:57.689> abdomen<00:02:58.049> at<00:02:58.530> all<00:02:58.829> and<00:02:59.159> um

I had pretty much no results from it um
I<00:03:40.790> definitely<00:03:41.790> wouldn't<00:03:42.479> recommend<00:03:42.690> it

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:43.319 
I definitely wouldn't recommend it

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:45.920

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
especially if you're someone like me who

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.069 
especially if you're someone like me who
has<00:03:46.530> a<00:03:46.560> lot<00:03:46.949> of<00:03:46.979> fat<00:03:47.310> in<00:03:47.340> the<00:03:47.669> area<00:03:47.970> I've<00:03:48.750> heard

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
has a lot of fat in the area I've heard

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:51.229 
has a lot of fat in the area I've heard
that<00:03:49.379> if<00:03:49.709> you<00:03:49.859> have<00:03:50.099> just<00:03:50.129> a<00:03:50.549> very<00:03:50.819> small

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
that if you have just a very small

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.089 
that if you have just a very small
pocket<00:03:51.720> of<00:03:51.780> fat<00:03:51.989> in<00:03:52.139> the<00:03:52.319> area<00:03:52.560> that<00:03:52.709> you<00:03:52.829> can't

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 
pocket of fat in the area that you can't

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:55.159 
pocket of fat in the area that you can't
get<00:03:53.250> rid<00:03:53.430> of<00:03:53.519> that<00:03:53.790> um<00:03:53.970> it<00:03:54.329> really<00:03:54.389> makes<00:03:54.959> a

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:55.169 
get rid of that um it really makes a

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:57.710 
get rid of that um it really makes a
more<00:03:55.349> noticeable<00:03:55.560> difference<00:03:56.489> if<00:03:57.329> you<00:03:57.540> have

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
more noticeable difference if you have

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.050 
more noticeable difference if you have
less<00:03:58.500> fat<00:03:58.799> to<00:03:59.040> lose<00:03:59.220> or<00:03:59.549> shrink<00:04:00.030> um

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
less fat to lose or shrink um

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.469 
less fat to lose or shrink um
but<00:04:03.060> yeah<00:04:03.239> for<00:04:03.479> me<00:04:03.689> um<00:04:04.560> it<00:04:04.859> basically<00:04:05.479> did

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:06.479

a<00:04:25.910> very<00:04:26.300> very<00:04:26.540> slight<00:04:27.110> like<00:04:27.500> the<00:04:27.650> way<00:04:27.770> it<00:04:27.890> made

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
a very very slight like the way it made

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.290 
a very very slight like the way it made
my<00:04:28.220> skin<00:04:28.280> floppy<00:04:29.060> and<00:04:29.270> I<00:04:29.720> noticed<00:04:30.470> that<00:04:30.740> um<00:04:31.300> but

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
my skin floppy and I noticed that um but

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.320 
my skin floppy and I noticed that um but
ultimately<00:04:33.020> after<00:04:33.620> six<00:04:34.280> sessions<00:04:34.580> which

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
ultimately after six sessions which

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.030 
ultimately after six sessions which
you're<00:04:35.870> supposed<00:04:36.080> to<00:04:36.470> see<00:04:36.680> quite<00:04:37.010> a

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 
you're supposed to see quite a

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.720 
you're supposed to see quite a
noticeable<00:04:37.730> result<00:04:38.180> after<00:04:38.360> six<00:04:38.870> sessions

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:39.730 
noticeable result after six sessions

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:44.550 
noticeable result after six sessions
there<00:04:40.730> was<00:04:40.910> just<00:04:41.210> no<00:04:41.750> real<00:04:43.060> no<00:04:44.060> real

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
there was just no real no real

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.180 
there was just no real no real
noticeable<00:04:45.560> difference<00:04:47.170> so<00:04:48.170> that's<00:04:48.860> my

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
noticeable difference so that's my

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.450 
noticeable difference so that's my
experience<00:04:49.910> with<00:04:50.270> fat<00:04:50.870> cavitation<00:04:51.710> if<00:04:52.100> you

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
experience with fat cavitation if you

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.240 
experience with fat cavitation if you
have<00:04:52.940> a<00:04:52.970> lot<00:04:53.270> of<00:04:53.300> fat<00:04:53.510> in<00:04:53.660> the<00:04:53.780> area<00:04:54.250> don't

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
have a lot of fat in the area don't

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.180 
have a lot of fat in the area don't
bother<00:04:55.750> really<00:04:56.750> it'll<00:04:57.200> just<00:04:57.470> be<00:04:57.620> a<00:04:57.650> waste<00:04:57.890> of

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
bother really it'll just be a waste of

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.630 
bother really it'll just be a waste of
your<00:04:58.310> money<00:04:59.350> if<00:05:00.350> you've<00:05:00.590> got<00:05:00.800> a<00:05:00.830> little<00:05:01.160> little

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:01.640 
your money if you've got a little little

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.430 
your money if you've got a little little
bit<00:05:01.880> of<00:05:01.970> fat<00:05:02.180> in<00:05:02.390> an<00:05:02.540> area<00:05:02.870> that<00:05:02.930> you<00:05:03.200> want<00:05:03.320> to

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
bit of fat in an area that you want to

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.980 
bit of fat in an area that you want to
try<00:05:03.650> and<00:05:03.770> get<00:05:03.860> rid<00:05:04.070> of<00:05:04.160> and<00:05:04.490> you've<00:05:05.090> got<00:05:05.330> money

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
try and get rid of and you've got money

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.610 
try and get rid of and you've got money
to<00:05:06.230> spend<00:05:06.650> then<00:05:07.430> I<00:05:07.910> guess<00:05:08.450> I<00:05:08.660> may<00:05:08.840> recommend<00:05:09.080> it

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
to spend then I guess I may recommend it

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.840 
to spend then I guess I may recommend it
in<00:05:09.800> that<00:05:10.010> instance<00:05:10.700> but<00:05:11.000> otherwise<00:05:11.950> no<00:05:12.950> I'm

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:13.850 
in that instance but otherwise no I'm

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:17.050 
in that instance but otherwise no I'm
not<00:05:14.120> really<00:05:14.570> happy<00:05:15.020> with<00:05:15.170> it<00:05:15.200> um<00:05:16.160> even<00:05:16.970> the

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
not really happy with it um even the

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.880 
not really happy with it um even the
money<00:05:17.240> I<00:05:17.300> did<00:05:17.600> spend<00:05:17.930> I<00:05:18.080> feel<00:05:18.320> that<00:05:18.650> was<00:05:18.860> a

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:18.890 
money I did spend I feel that was a

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:19.840 
money I did spend I feel that was a
waste<00:05:19.190> of<00:05:19.370> money

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:19.850 
waste of money

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:23.830 
waste of money
