enjoyed<00:01:59.219> this<00:01:59.399> song<00:01:59.579> more<00:01:59.820> than<00:01:59.880> raise<00:02:00.180> this

barn<00:02:00.540> particularly<00:02:01.290> because<00:02:01.409> it<00:02:01.649> doesn't

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
barn particularly because it doesn't

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.980 
barn particularly because it doesn't
feel<00:02:02.009> like<00:02:02.070> a<00:02:02.250> montage<00:02:02.729> song<00:02:03.060> in<00:02:03.450> addition<00:02:03.869> the

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
feel like a montage song in addition the

feel like a montage song in addition the
song<00:02:04.170> actually<00:02:04.530> has<00:02:04.649> a<00:02:04.680> connection<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.219> the

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
song actually has a connection to the

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.859 
song actually has a connection to the
theme<00:02:05.490> of<00:02:05.640> remaining<00:02:05.909> together<00:02:06.299> despite<00:02:06.719> the

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
theme of remaining together despite the

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:07.910 
theme of remaining together despite the
struggles<00:02:07.020> that<00:02:07.229> come<00:02:07.469> with<00:02:07.619> it

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
struggles that come with it

subdued<00:02:13.080> than<00:02:13.560> the<00:02:13.650> rest

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
subdued than the rest

fun but at the same time is actually

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.710 
fun but at the same time is actually
being<00:02:18.160> a<00:02:18.280> positive<00:02:18.520> influence<00:02:18.940> for<00:02:19.360> the<00:02:19.540> rest

becomes a driving force for the plot and

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.570 
becomes a driving force for the plot and

I<00:02:37.670> could<00:02:38.630> already<00:02:38.780> tell<00:02:39.230> that<00:02:39.260> Applebloom

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
I could already tell that Applebloom

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.470 
I could already tell that Applebloom
would<00:02:40.100> lose<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:40.640> map<00:02:40.850> when<00:02:41.060> she<00:02:41.180> starts

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
would lose the map when she starts

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.150 
would lose the map when she starts
playing<00:02:41.840> with<00:02:41.930> it<00:02:42.170> but<00:02:42.350> this<00:02:42.530> is<00:02:42.680> turning<00:02:43.070> out

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
playing with it but this is turning out

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.460 
playing with it but this is turning out
to<00:02:43.190> be<00:02:43.310> an<00:02:43.490> interesting<00:02:43.730> and<00:02:44.180> relatable

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
to be an interesting and relatable

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.620 
to be an interesting and relatable
conflict<00:02:45.470> I<00:02:45.680> must<00:02:46.370> admit<00:02:46.550> this<00:02:46.970> episode<00:02:47.480> is

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
conflict I must admit this episode is

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.750 
conflict I must admit this episode is
showing<00:02:47.900> an<00:02:48.050> even<00:02:48.440> more<00:02:48.710> relatable<00:02:49.250> Apple

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
showing an even more relatable Apple

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.700 
showing an even more relatable Apple
family<00:02:50.120> than<00:02:50.300> any<00:02:50.570> other<00:02:50.780> episode<00:02:50.960> I've<00:02:51.410> seen

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:51.710 
family than any other episode I've seen

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.340 
family than any other episode I've seen
thus<00:02:51.950> far<00:02:51.980> we've<00:02:52.970> seen<00:02:53.270> many<00:02:53.600> examples<00:02:53.720> of

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
thus far we've seen many examples of

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.020 
thus far we've seen many examples of
their<00:02:54.500> close<00:02:54.800> bonds<00:02:55.430> and<00:02:55.520> even<00:02:55.760> how<00:02:55.880> they've

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
their close bonds and even how they've

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.090 
their close bonds and even how they've
overcome<00:02:56.390> their<00:02:56.840> struggles<00:02:56.870> together<00:02:57.500> but

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
overcome their struggles together but

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.920 
overcome their struggles together but
now<00:02:58.310> we<00:02:58.370> get<00:02:58.670> to<00:02:58.760> see<00:02:58.940> all<00:02:59.120> of<00:02:59.180> them<00:02:59.600> showing

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
now we get to see all of them showing

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.750 
now we get to see all of them showing
they're<00:03:00.170> less<00:03:00.470> patient<00:03:01.070> and<00:03:01.220> less<00:03:01.400> forgiving

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
they're less patient and less forgiving

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.390 
they're less patient and less forgiving
sides<00:03:02.240> and<00:03:02.630> that's<00:03:03.020> a<00:03:03.170> nice<00:03:03.350> change<00:03:03.830> I<00:03:04.130> must

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
sides and that's a nice change I must

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.430 
sides and that's a nice change I must
say<00:03:04.640> we<00:03:05.150> may<00:03:05.330> have<00:03:05.420> seen<00:03:05.690> many<00:03:05.900> inspiring

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
say we may have seen many inspiring

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.960 
say we may have seen many inspiring
moments<00:03:07.040> from<00:03:07.130> their<00:03:07.310> families<00:03:07.790> throughout

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
moments from their families throughout

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.760 
moments from their families throughout
the<00:03:08.150> series<00:03:08.390> but<00:03:08.720> it's<00:03:08.840> really<00:03:09.110> good<00:03:09.440> to<00:03:09.620> see

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
the series but it's really good to see

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.730 
the series but it's really good to see
that<00:03:09.800> they<00:03:10.040> can<00:03:10.100> be<00:03:10.220> relatable<00:03:10.940> as<00:03:11.060> well<00:03:11.330> and

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:11.740 
that they can be relatable as well and

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:19.720 
that they can be relatable as well and
pinkies<00:03:12.740> pictures<00:03:13.310> here<00:03:13.610> are<00:03:13.820> hilarious

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.729 

now<00:03:20.730> this<00:03:21.000> may<00:03:21.150> be<00:03:21.180> just<00:03:21.330> my<00:03:21.780> observations<00:03:22.500> but

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
now this may be just my observations but

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.770 
now this may be just my observations but
I<00:03:22.860> think<00:03:23.159> Natasha<00:03:23.489> Levenger<00:03:24.030> managed<00:03:24.420> to<00:03:24.569> fix

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
I think Natasha Levenger managed to fix

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.080 
I think Natasha Levenger managed to fix

focused on retreading Apple Jacks issues

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.360 
focused on retreading Apple Jacks issues
instead<00:03:31.200> of<00:03:31.379> introducing<00:03:31.890> the<00:03:31.980> struggles<00:03:32.310> of

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.490 
on the family as a whole and his
struggles<00:03:36.450> instead<00:03:36.750> of<00:03:36.840> just<00:03:37.049> one<00:03:37.290> pony

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500
