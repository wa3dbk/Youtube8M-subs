00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 the tamer and the horse owners must 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.350
 be alert to the animal's health and 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.929
 some care start at the hull 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.450
 grazing or 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.259
 scraping the hull and then placing the 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.120
 horseshoe 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:25.050
 are alternatives to ensure good 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:27.510
 performance in animal competitions 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.939
 seems to parade to maintain elegance 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.160
 the desired performance mainly in 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.670
 competitions some 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.680
 care that begins with the 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.329
 gravelling and shoeing are 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.940
 alternatives for correcting and 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.829
 stability when walking the animal does not 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.010
 leaving it to develop problems of 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.469
 health in tendons mainly silva 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.449
 He worked for 25 years in the area and says 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.110
 activities must be carried out with the 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.120
 horse since small cooling is where 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.579
 You correct the animal's footsteps . 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.670
 ah and you start this with an animal 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.830
 newborn from the age of 30 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.470
 besides the correction already proved that it is 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.510
 doing asepsis of the hull with that you 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.830
 will avoid various hunting problems like 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:17.729
 crack is drill necrosis danilo between 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.890
 others in the part of your regiment is more 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.729
 indicated by the test at the top 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:28.710
 yield better traction 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:31.439
 off the slopes on campus ii is a local 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.970
 with a lot of stone makes it difficult for the 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.759
 animal and with this can give 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.790
 problems on the soles and when you are 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.560
 thanks regardless of field or 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.150
 track is when you see that the animal 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.729
 have high soles this animal is very 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.009
 sensitive to his or her sensitivity to the 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:51.570
 very big and that's what you get 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:55.110
 decrease alleviate this stress in this 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.240
 case that causes it if it is catching 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.700
 an impact on a rock 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.619
 already with this you reducing the 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.460
 reduction is very large reaches 90 to 100 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.820
 Percent 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.229
 the steps are carefully followed 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:10.289
 first observe how the animal is 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.840
 walking measure and charm measure again 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:16.170
 everything to identify the right level for 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.450
 starting the wedding makes cleaning cuts the 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.530
 excess waste again and the 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.260
 finishes 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.129
 the marriage is ready the next step 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.129
 the horseshoe 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.290
 the instructor ensures that this practice 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.390
 necessary for the animals that will give 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.970
 beginning the dressage and participating in 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.500
 competitions for each modality a 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.840
 different model 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.580
 and do not stop there maintenance is 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.549
 fundamental to ensure a good 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.920
 work both as gravelling 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:48.769
 40 days closing 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.959
 is indicated if an animal with the problem 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:52.430
 You have to make up to 15 days before you 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:55.909
 Here comes a horse. 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:58.010
 so when you're screwed it almost 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:59.870
 You've always done with these 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.180
 problems you had that you would have to 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.670
 have homes that his up to 15 days 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.569
 right then there a 40 day maintenance 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.290
 it's great 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:11.329
 is his health begins in the case patrician 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.970
 accompanies the work of the spouse she 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:15.799
 has participated in competitions for three 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.440
 says that a well-cared horse is 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:20.750
 important for test performance 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.090
 the animal without horseshoes that neither in the test 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.620
 of work at the time of the councilman if he 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.680
 to slip people are losing that is 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:30.530
 second alice alice he slip and 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.959
 harms people and him with a horseshoe 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.910
 he already has more difficulty 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.739
 sliding and has more accuracy in a 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.340
 movement that is what we need 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:39.340
 agility 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.720
 remembering that these activities require 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.060
 care and every sporting modality
