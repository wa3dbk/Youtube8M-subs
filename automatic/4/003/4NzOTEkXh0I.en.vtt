00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.680
 I see you looking at me and my friends always say the same thing. 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.000
 I need you to stop drinking now. 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.000
 We do not have to go up there. 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:44.880
 I do not have a top. 

00:00:45.374 --> 00:00:47.974
 She's going to be about five feet, six feet. 

00:00:47.974 --> 00:00:50.614
 The tall, thick skeletal buttocks are more prominent. 

00:00:50.614 --> 00:00:53.254
 Im thinking of rolling my cigarette, licking her lips 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.180
 She's a type that fits easily with gangs. 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.740
 (Zulu) 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.140
 She's an easy-to-read girl. She'll tell you how she feels. 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.660
 She feels happy about giving and receiving something. 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.300
 She knows what I'm doing and I'm happy about what it is. 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.580
 We burn herbs and talk about our dreams 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.420
 How we succeed together 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.600
 We enjoyed it. 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.710
 We have sex after smoking 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.410
 As soon as I put my stuff in, she lost her temper. 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.000
 I spent the night as if I passed the final exam of my last class. 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.640
 Every time I go outside, a new girl checks me out. 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.840
 I see you looking at me and my friends always say the same thing. 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.800
 I need you to stop drinking now. 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.700
 We do not have to go up there. 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:46.560
 I do not have a top. 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.640
 I do not usually do this. 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.720
 I'm lying, I often do it 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.660
 You tell him you love him and he leaves him, why he wants you to leave. 

00:01:55.067 --> 00:01:57.067
 My body shouts at me. Please give me a baby. 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.660
 I do not want to sound like a bad person But I do not beg 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.860
 I imagined MC, I begged 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.180
 First you listen to your beautiful feet and then you help me pick a beat. 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.220
 We only do what you want to do and I guarantee 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.000
 Everything you want to try is fine with me. 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.260
 I've done it before. 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.320
 Or four, maybe five, maybe six. 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.620
 And I'll do better than the other guys you've met. 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.420
 I do not want to sound arrogant, but I just say what I see. 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.240
 My father was confident, and his confidence gave me birth. 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.840
 Every time I go outside, a new girl checks me out. 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.100
 I see you looking at me and my friends always say the same thing. 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.100
 I need you to stop drinking now. 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.620
 We do not have to go up there. 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:47.020
 I do not have a top.
