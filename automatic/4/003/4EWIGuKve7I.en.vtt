00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
goes up slowly and the little bubble

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.410 
goes up slowly and the little bubble
which<00:01:18.510> once<00:01:18.900> you<00:01:19.020> trade<00:01:19.260> on<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.550> explodes<00:01:20.550> so

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
which once you trade on it explodes so

try to stay on the air big bubbles if

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.450 
try to stay on the air big bubbles if
you<00:01:23.250> can<00:01:23.540> watch<00:01:24.540> out<00:01:24.810> for<00:01:24.990> these<00:01:25.110> random<00:01:26.010> drill

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460

fish<00:01:26.790> I<00:01:27.090> do<00:01:27.210> prefer<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.690> jump<00:01:27.900> as<00:01:28.050> high<00:01:28.080> as

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
fish I do prefer to jump as high as

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.340 
fish I do prefer to jump as high as
possible<00:01:28.380> just<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:29.070> trigger<00:01:29.460> them<00:01:30.140> but<00:01:31.140> this

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
possible just to trigger them but this

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.700 
possible just to trigger them but this
is<00:01:31.530> slow<00:01:31.860> anyway<00:01:32.850> jump<00:01:33.390> high<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:33.960> there<00:01:34.470> we<00:01:34.560> go

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
is slow anyway jump high and there we go

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.010 
is slow anyway jump high and there we go
that's<00:01:34.920> what<00:01:34.980> i<00:01:35.070> mean<00:01:35.220> by<00:01:35.340> triggering<00:01:35.760> them

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
that's what i mean by triggering them

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.090 
that's what i mean by triggering them
otherwise<00:01:37.020> they<00:01:37.080> would<00:01:37.590> have<00:01:37.620> just<00:01:37.710> plowed

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
otherwise they would have just plowed

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.860 
otherwise they would have just plowed
into<00:01:38.370> you<00:01:38.550> if<00:01:38.610> you<00:01:38.730> sat<00:01:39.000> on<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.210> bubble<00:01:39.510> wonder

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:39.870 
into you if you sat on the bubble wonder

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.750 
into you if you sat on the bubble wonder
you<00:01:40.110> don't<00:01:40.260> want<00:01:40.500> that<00:01:40.620> even<00:01:41.010> if<00:01:41.100> all<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.670> way

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
lights off there if be especially

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.160 
lights off there if be especially

careful if you're not too confident and

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.500 
careful if you're not too confident and
just<00:02:21.200> you<00:02:21.709> know<00:02:21.830> sit<00:02:22.069> back<00:02:22.310> watch<00:02:22.819> the<00:02:22.879> pattern

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
just you know sit back watch the pattern

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.110 
just you know sit back watch the pattern
first<00:02:23.810> and<00:02:24.080> then<00:02:24.410> make<00:02:24.620> you<00:02:24.830> move<00:02:25.069> my<00:02:25.819> point

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
first and then make you move my point

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.699 
first and then make you move my point
just<00:02:26.299> jumping<00:02:26.930> and<00:02:27.049> guessing<00:02:27.500> where<00:02:27.650> you

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:27.709 
just jumping and guessing where you

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.479 
just jumping and guessing where you
going<00:02:27.830> to<00:02:27.890> land<00:02:28.269> oops<00:02:29.829> well<00:02:30.829> you'll<00:02:31.220> get<00:02:31.310> to

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
going to land oops well you'll get to

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:32.680 
going to land oops well you'll get to
look<00:02:31.610> at<00:02:31.700> the<00:02:31.760> pattern<00:02:32.000> licking<00:02:32.299> then<00:02:32.480> how

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
look at the pattern licking then how

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.780 
look at the pattern licking then how
about<00:02:32.750> that<00:02:32.900> oh<00:02:33.370> good<00:02:34.370> to<00:02:34.489> you<00:02:34.579> guys

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.789 

again<00:02:37.510> just<00:02:37.719> be<00:02:37.930> careful<00:02:38.349> with<00:02:38.379> that<00:02:38.469> little

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
again just be careful with that little

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:43.740 
again just be careful with that little
spiky<00:02:39.519> partly<00:02:41.849> okay<00:02:42.849> that's<00:02:43.269> why<00:02:43.420> we<00:02:43.599> are

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
spiky partly okay that's why we are

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.720 
spiky partly okay that's why we are
taking<00:02:43.959> parts<00:02:44.409> the<00:02:44.530> stage<00:02:44.769> out<00:02:45.069> of<00:02:45.099> the<00:02:45.189> way<00:02:45.340> if

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
taking parts the stage out of the way if

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.170 
taking parts the stage out of the way if
not<00:02:46.000> the<00:02:46.150> most<00:02:46.180> irritating<00:02:46.659> pop<00:02:47.879> can<00:02:48.879> avoid

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
not the most irritating pop can avoid

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
is the horny chasing which one makes us

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.320 
is the horny chasing which one makes us
better<00:03:53.600> way<00:03:53.870> hell<00:03:54.200> of<00:03:54.350> a<00:03:54.410> lot<00:03:54.530> shorter<00:03:55.330> i
