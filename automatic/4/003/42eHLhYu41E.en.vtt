00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.960
 the stock sailor had decided per 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.270
 ship to cross the space around the 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.330
 Rocket of babies to steal 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.970
 he lived on his own last 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.330
 Designs built interstellar jaw 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:36.570
 He stroked to paint something 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:40.399
 He went to his navy 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.399
 everything is welcomed what I want and 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:51.930
 rest is painted 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:01:03.180
 on the day of departure was a big 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:01:05.040
 a joyful city ​​one even dismissed 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.200
 some intrepid schar dogs from the 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.200
 grip and invited her to rowing 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:27.770
 and they left and they were hardly gone 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:31.060
 was a memorial unveiled with the 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:34.280
 inscription our daring in the universe 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.470
 different sailors one knew yes 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.200
 that they would not return 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.070
 The stupid guys, however, knew about 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.830
 nothing 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.050
 they had just left her around her 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.640
 get rid of 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:51.020
 besides, I was not much 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:55.610
 water and after a while that remained 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:58.060
 boat and then nothing was out of it 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:01.550
 Of course, this is nothing 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.980
 the situation at the jobs is satisfactory 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:07.760
 the rockets are trying to fail 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:10.660
 continue to plan the basic principle of 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.980
 stock logic this was just by 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.060
 non-stop attempts can do it 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.880
 finally pushing 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.100
 in other words, the more often it went wrong 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.100
 is is the greater the chance that is 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.230
 happiness as the shabak be that this 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.720
 no rocket attempts were made 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.580
 convinced that you are the first to earth 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.940
 reach and take possession of them 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.470
 would 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.370
 she started with her try in the 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.790
 Dawn 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:40.100
 Everything went wrong during the morning 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.140
 if it went well six 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.140
 sometimes even 7 starts 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.670
 that was rarely around noon they took 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:51.320
 a light meal then 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:54.880
 They continued until the next one 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.880
 look very morning 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:02.630
 she started again 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:05.120
 which cares for gis at the other end of the world 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.490
 Rest assured their gardens and reaped 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.200
 the seed grains for electric motors and 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.810
 many other things she has on earth 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.410
 wanted to take the departure moved 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.720
 closer 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.330
 Nevertheless, they made no start attempts 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.000
 because basically everything is always with them 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.860
 The first time it works out in the evening 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.170
 then came from the fields home 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.500
 They watched the sharks on TV 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.480
 on 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.970
 that was much funnier now because she was 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.260
 since the departure of the stop pirate two 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.480
 had programs 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.770
 if they try the failed one 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.390
 walk sharks for a long time 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:38.150
 then they switched to rowing 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.220
 Sailors pour out for meaningful 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:43.190
 laugh when they saw this 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:47.210
 unfortunate creature actually the 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:49.430
 intentional had their rocket found at the end 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:51.950
 they decided to grant the chance 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:54.680
 let because they thought it was worth it 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.730
 determines such strange animals from the 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.640
 to see near 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:01.060
 and while trying the city box 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:04.760
 continue to monitor the unsuccessful 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:07.070
 sheer instruments garden up to 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.350
 seed maturity pass the time 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:11.030
 mostly with the television 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.730
 rocket try the cup run again 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.860
 in several phases from first vote 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:20.500
 the technicians the countdown after one 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.500
 old accordion melody 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.710
 around 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.200
 then describe the most gifted 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.990
 mathematician or the stopps her 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:45.620
 pedals counter around the trajectory too 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.620
 calculate 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:54.030
 These people have the hardest part too 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.550
 the sharks had to be from the 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.770
 hear the following the faster one 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.010
 Counter counts here are more accurate 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:01.010
 results 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.520
 consequently, he has the right trajectory 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:10.550
 calculates the most zealous in the 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:10.550
 pedals throws to the conclusion is ignited 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:25.350
 it fails and everything starts immediately 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:35.580
 from the front 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:38.040
 so it can take a long time as you can 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.900
 White, the shuttle era is undressed 

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:41.970
 babies steal their rocket 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:46.740
 Let's see what they are doing 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:49.680
 Of course brother of the pirate the boat 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:52.220
 Commanding is usually quite nice 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:52.220
 smashed 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:00.099
 and nobody cares about that 

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:02.169
 course of the vehicle but the pirate thinks 

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:03.819
 that is so common in the marine 

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:06.300
 besides, it should be a lot of interesting 

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:09.099
 to see where it does not drive 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:10.780
 and from the gentlemen pay times and 

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:12.430
 because you can still see where 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:14.530
 nobody goes there once you get there 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:16.169
 arrived and also that is in 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:17.919
 In any case, only water was what you get 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:23.169
 except of course there are 

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:29.860
 any surprises so called 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:30.580
 For example, one day a seaman no 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:35.050
 water 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:37.090
 the bread got stuck now 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:38.770
 City if you are watching people 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:43.930
 the water in front of the ship sometimes 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:46.389
 suddenly icebergs felde help or 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:48.699
 but they also had a wrong turn 

00:06:46.389 --> 00:06:51.280
 observed that behind the pen always 

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:53.680
 Water was completely useless 

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:55.719
 Water to move forward, they decided 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.729
 the back water to the front too 

00:06:55.719 --> 00:07:00.960
 Create where it's from the oarsmen again 

00:06:57.729 --> 00:07:00.960
 rowed back 

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:09.009
 that was a very real one 

00:07:06.599 --> 00:07:12.279
 navigation system, however, very much 

00:07:09.009 --> 00:07:15.190
 Effortless, the question arose whether 

00:07:12.279 --> 00:07:20.580
 our brave sailors in this way 

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:20.580
 reach the other end of the universe
