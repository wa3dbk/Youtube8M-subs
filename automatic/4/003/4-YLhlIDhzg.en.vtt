00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
the radius but they need it needs to be

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.270 
the radius but they need it needs to be
a<00:01:20.880> wider<00:01:21.210> radius<00:01:21.780> of<00:01:22.079> so<00:01:22.860> you<00:01:22.950> don't<00:01:23.100> have<00:01:23.159> to

a wider radius of so you don't have to

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.980 
a wider radius of so you don't have to
have<00:01:23.369> any<00:01:23.429> skill<00:01:23.820> at<00:01:23.969> all<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.299> just<00:01:24.329> point<00:01:24.810> and
