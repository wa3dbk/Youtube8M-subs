she knew she was a DP hit her and that's

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.000 
she knew she was a DP hit her and that's
it<00:03:32.410> now<00:03:32.650> she's<00:03:33.099> more<00:03:33.459> of<00:03:33.640> a<00:03:33.670> senior<00:03:34.660> leader

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
it now she's more of a senior leader

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.470 
it now she's more of a senior leader
she's<00:03:36.010> not<00:03:36.190> one<00:03:36.370> of<00:03:36.400> the<00:03:36.580> captains<00:03:36.819> and<00:03:37.390> I

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
she's not one of the captains and I

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.420 
she's not one of the captains and I
think<00:03:37.720> that<00:03:37.870> takes<00:03:38.110> pressure<00:03:38.410> off<00:03:38.560> of<00:03:38.920> her<00:03:39.099> but

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
think that takes pressure off of her but

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.910 
think that takes pressure off of her but
being<00:03:39.849> a<00:03:40.000> senior<00:03:40.360> leader<00:03:40.540> hitting<00:03:41.379> over<00:03:41.530> 400

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
which not many people do that that's

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.020 
which not many people do that that's
something<00:03:44.769> that<00:03:44.950> gives<00:03:45.220> you<00:03:45.430> a<00:03:45.459> little<00:03:45.700> bit<00:03:45.910> of

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
something that gives you a little bit of

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.750 
something that gives you a little bit of
step<00:03:46.329> above<00:03:46.750> everyone<00:03:47.200> and<00:03:47.680> and<00:03:47.950> the<00:03:48.310> distance

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
step above everyone and and the distance

she<00:03:48.940> hits<00:03:49.150> the<00:03:49.269> ball<00:03:49.540> is<00:03:49.810> just<00:03:50.069> awe-inspiring

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:51.069 
she hits the ball is just awe-inspiring

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:53.309 
she hits the ball is just awe-inspiring
