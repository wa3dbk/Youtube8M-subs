third<00:00:19.830> molars<00:00:20.160> in<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.369> building<00:00:20.670> and

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
third molars in the building and

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.450 
third molars in the building and
somebody's<00:00:21.420> scammed<00:00:22.170> all<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.650> premolars

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
somebody's scammed all the premolars

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.359 
somebody's scammed all the premolars
that<00:00:23.730> we<00:00:23.789> extracted<00:00:24.300> so<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:24.840> I<00:00:25.260> wanted<00:00:26.070> to<00:00:26.130> get

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
that we extracted so and I wanted to get

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.390 
that we extracted so and I wanted to get
this<00:00:26.869> little<00:00:27.869> tip<00:00:28.109> that<00:00:28.140> I<00:00:28.349> was<00:00:28.830> taught<00:00:29.220> by<00:00:29.340> the

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
this little tip that I was taught by the

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.209 
this little tip that I was taught by the
endodontist<00:00:29.939> out<00:00:30.230> so<00:00:31.230> pretend<00:00:31.800> again<00:00:31.890> these

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
endodontist out so pretend again these

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.090 
endodontist out so pretend again these
are<00:00:32.540> your<00:00:33.540> buccal<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:33.870> facial<00:00:34.230> canals<00:00:34.530> on<00:00:34.829> say

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
are your buccal and facial canals on say

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.119 
are your buccal and facial canals on say
a<00:00:35.130> premolar<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:36.020> often<00:00:37.020> when<00:00:37.680> you<00:00:37.770> go<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:37.950> do

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
a premolar and often when you go to do

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.280 
a premolar and often when you go to do
your<00:00:38.309> working<00:00:38.520> length<00:00:38.850> you<00:00:39.450> have<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:40.050> place

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
your working length you have you place

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.869 
your working length you have you place
the<00:00:40.410> files<00:00:40.649> in<00:00:40.980> you<00:00:41.250> take<00:00:41.430> your<00:00:41.550> first<00:00:41.730> shot

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
the files in you take your first shot

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.200 
the files in you take your first shot
and<00:00:42.360> you're<00:00:42.930> still<00:00:43.200> kind<00:00:43.379> of<00:00:43.440> like<00:00:43.649> well<00:00:44.210> it's

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
and you're still kind of like well it's

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.510 
and you're still kind of like well it's
really<00:00:45.510> tough<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.719> tell<00:00:46.050> which<00:00:46.410> canal<00:00:47.340> is

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
really tough to tell which canal is

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.869 
really tough to tell which canal is
which<00:00:48.260> so<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.559> then<00:00:50.010> you<00:00:50.129> do<00:00:50.309> one<00:00:50.550> gate<00:00:50.730> let's

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
which so and then you do one gate let's

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.459 
which so and then you do one gate let's
take<00:00:51.030> your<00:00:51.120> shift<00:00:51.300> shot<00:00:51.510> there's<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.230> shift

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
take your shift shot there's a shift

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.510 
take your shift shot there's a shift
shot<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:52.920> you're<00:00:53.520> still<00:00:54.110> kind<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.350> well<00:00:55.890> I'm

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
shot and you're still kind of well I'm

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.599 
shot and you're still kind of well I'm
not<00:00:56.820> sure<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.600> say<00:00:57.719> your<00:00:57.870> links<00:00:58.170> aren't<00:00:58.609> these

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
not sure and say your links aren't these

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.959 
not sure and say your links aren't these
are<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.760> little<00:00:59.879> bit<00:01:00.260> long<00:01:01.260> perhaps<00:01:01.859> you<00:01:02.789> want

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
are a little bit long perhaps you want

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.000 
are a little bit long perhaps you want
to<00:01:03.059> shorten<00:01:03.420> one<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:03.809> them<00:01:03.989> or<00:01:04.350> two<00:01:04.650> or<00:01:04.920> you

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
to shorten one of them or two or you

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.740 
to shorten one of them or two or you
want<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.189> do<00:01:05.309> whatever<00:01:05.549> you<00:01:05.790> want<00:01:06.030> with<00:01:06.330> one<00:01:06.659> of

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
want to do whatever you want with one of

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.000 
want to do whatever you want with one of
the<00:01:06.810> canals<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.350> you're<00:01:07.439> trying<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.830> figure

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
the canals and you're trying to figure

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.120 
the canals and you're trying to figure
out<00:01:08.159> which<00:01:08.460> is<00:01:08.640> which<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.479> some<00:01:10.380> folks<00:01:10.680> you

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
out which is which and some folks you

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.219 
out which is which and some folks you
know<00:01:11.189> they<00:01:11.310> may<00:01:11.490> change<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.570> length<00:01:12.810> of<00:01:13.080> the

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
know they may change the length of the

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.690 
know they may change the length of the
stopper<00:01:13.939> a<00:01:14.939> rubber<00:01:15.330> stopper<00:01:15.630> up<00:01:16.080> top<00:01:16.490> you<00:01:17.490> can

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
stopper a rubber stopper up top you can

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.730 
stopper a rubber stopper up top you can
use<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.210> different<00:01:18.540> file<00:01:18.780> size<00:01:19.049> but<00:01:19.320> what<00:01:19.500> I<00:01:19.530> was

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
use a different file size but what I was

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.440 
use a different file size but what I was
one<00:01:20.100> trick<00:01:20.340> I<00:01:20.460> was<00:01:20.580> taught<00:01:20.820> was<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.180> use<00:01:21.330> the

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
one trick I was taught was to use the

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.950 
one trick I was taught was to use the
same<00:01:21.659> file<00:01:21.900> size<00:01:22.200> we<00:01:22.320> use<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.470> different<00:01:22.740> file

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
same file size we use a different file

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.860 
same file size we use a different file
so<00:01:24.560> using<00:01:24.860> a<00:01:24.950> Hedstrom<00:01:25.370> in<00:01:25.550> this<00:01:25.730> case<00:01:26.000> you<00:01:26.690> can

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:26.870 
so using a Hedstrom in this case you can

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.380 
so using a Hedstrom in this case you can
immediately<00:01:27.800> tell<00:01:28.250> that<00:01:28.310> one<00:01:28.880> of<00:01:29.000> the<00:01:29.090> canal

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
immediately tell that one of the canal

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.140 
immediately tell that one of the canal
which<00:01:29.750> canal<00:01:30.170> is<00:01:30.290> which<00:01:30.470> depending<00:01:30.950> on

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150 
which canal is which depending on

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.720 
which canal is which depending on
whether<00:01:32.150> you<00:01:32.300> placed<00:01:32.540> it<00:01:32.720> again<00:01:33.170> remember

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:33.730 
whether you placed it again remember

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.040 
whether you placed it again remember
pretending<00:01:34.730> this<00:01:34.820> is<00:01:34.880> a<00:01:35.030> premolar<00:01:35.390> whether

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050 
pretending this is a premolar whether

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.630 
pretending this is a premolar whether
this<00:01:36.230> is<00:01:36.410> either<00:01:36.530> your<00:01:36.740> palatal<00:01:37.130> canal<00:01:37.400> or

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
this is either your palatal canal or

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.400 
this is either your palatal canal or
arbuckle<00:01:38.240> canal<00:01:38.510> and<00:01:38.750> on<00:01:38.810> your<00:01:38.960> shift<00:01:39.200> you<00:01:39.350> can

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:39.410 
arbuckle canal and on your shift you can

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:45.640 
arbuckle canal and on your shift you can
tell<00:01:40.900> much<00:01:41.900> easier<00:01:42.470> which<00:01:43.430> is<00:01:43.640> which<00:01:43.880> so<00:01:44.650> this

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
tell much easier which is which so this

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:46.930 
tell much easier which is which so this
is<00:01:45.770> a<00:01:45.800> headstrong<00:01:46.160> file<00:01:46.430> you<00:01:46.580> can<00:01:46.729> definitely

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:46.940 
is a headstrong file you can definitely

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.390 
is a headstrong file you can definitely
see<00:01:47.360> it's<00:01:47.479> different<00:01:47.720> and<00:01:48.100> what<00:01:49.100> do<00:01:49.160> they<00:01:49.250> look

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
see it's different and what do they look

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.280 
see it's different and what do they look
like<00:01:49.550> on<00:01:49.880> radiographic<00:01:50.479> this<00:01:50.780> is<00:01:50.869> a<00:01:50.900> Hedstrom

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
like on radiographic this is a Hedstrom

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.230 
like on radiographic this is a Hedstrom
file<00:01:51.590> here<00:01:51.920> and<00:01:52.100> this<00:01:52.430> is<00:01:52.580> a<00:01:52.610> regular<00:01:52.970> cave

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
file here and this is a regular cave
