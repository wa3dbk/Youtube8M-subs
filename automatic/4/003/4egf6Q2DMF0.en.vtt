a<00:03:44.770> lot<00:03:44.920> so<00:03:45.280> I'm<00:03:45.910> looking<00:03:46.120> at<00:03:46.360> him<00:03:46.690> as<00:03:46.810> a

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
a lot so I'm looking at him as a

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.840 
a lot so I'm looking at him as a
possible<00:03:47.170> pick<00:03:47.740> you<00:03:48.010> know<00:03:48.160> it's<00:03:48.310> quarterback

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
possible pick you know it's quarterback

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.080 
possible pick you know it's quarterback
try<00:03:49.180> like<00:03:49.630> second<00:03:50.350> or<00:03:50.440> third<00:03:50.620> round

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
try like second or third round

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:54.660 
try like second or third round
especially<00:03:52.090> if<00:03:52.209> we<00:03:52.330> can<00:03:52.510> get<00:03:52.830> Sammy<00:03:53.830> Watkins<00:03:54.160> I

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
especially if we can get Sammy Watkins I

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.030 
especially if we can get Sammy Watkins I
think<00:03:55.030> that<00:03:55.150> would<00:03:55.240> be<00:03:55.300> a<00:03:55.420> big<00:03:56.410> plus<00:03:56.740> for<00:03:56.800> us

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
I'm dropping you know I think we should

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.940 
I'm dropping you know I think we should
look<00:04:00.310> at<00:04:00.459> offensive<00:04:00.910> lineman<00:04:01.530> wide<00:04:02.530> receivers

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
look at offensive lineman wide receivers

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.000 
look at offensive lineman wide receivers
and<00:04:03.100> quarterbacks<00:04:03.220> I<00:04:04.440> think<00:04:05.440> offensive

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
and quarterbacks I think offensive

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.310 
and quarterbacks I think offensive
lineman<00:04:06.400> it<00:04:06.489> definitely<00:04:06.970> a<00:04:07.270> weak<00:04:07.840> spot<00:04:07.959> right

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
lineman it definitely a weak spot right

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.020 
lineman it definitely a weak spot right
