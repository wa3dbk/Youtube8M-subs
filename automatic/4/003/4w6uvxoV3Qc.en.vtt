seen in black ops of the original and a
world<00:00:51.390> at<00:00:51.600> war<00:00:51.629> so<00:00:52.440> this<00:00:52.590> is<00:00:52.620> zoomed<00:00:53.129> in<00:00:53.340> the

world at war so this is zoomed in the
image<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.000> i'm<00:00:54.180> just<00:00:54.300> going<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.510> freeze<00:00:54.930> the

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
image and i'm just going to freeze the

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.170 
image and i'm just going to freeze the
image<00:00:55.199> here<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:55.860> as<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:56.460> guys<00:00:56.640> can<00:00:56.910> see<00:00:56.969> you

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
image here and as you guys can see you

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.090 
image here and as you guys can see you
see<00:00:57.360> those<00:00:57.510> red<00:00:57.780> dots<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:58.350> little<00:00:58.739> bit<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:58.980> the

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
see those red dots a little bit to the

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.590 
see those red dots a little bit to the
right<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.520> reason<00:00:59.850> why<00:00:59.940> I<00:00:59.969> did<00:01:00.270> that<00:01:00.300> is

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
right the reason why I did that is

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.110 
right the reason why I did that is
because<00:01:01.170> if<00:01:01.710> I<00:01:02.010> didn't<00:01:02.550> have<00:01:02.640> those<00:01:02.820> dots

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
because if I didn't have those dots

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.210 
because if I didn't have those dots
there<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.449> little<00:01:03.780> bit<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.140> right<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:05.100> guys

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
there a little bit to the right you guys

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.190 
there a little bit to the right you guys
would<00:01:05.489> if<00:01:05.729> I<00:01:05.909> had<00:01:05.939> it<00:01:06.210> like<00:01:06.360> aim<00:01:06.570> directly<00:01:06.780> on

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
would if I had it like aim directly on

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.149 
would if I had it like aim directly on
it<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.409> wouldn't<00:01:07.590> be<00:01:07.710> able<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.890> see<00:01:08.070> it

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
it you wouldn't be able to see it

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.960 
it you wouldn't be able to see it
through<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.460> red<00:01:08.670> um<00:01:09.030> scope<00:01:10.010> so<00:01:11.010> what<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:11.760> want

to<00:02:15.200> know<00:02:15.320> that<00:02:15.530> they're<00:02:15.740> not<00:02:15.890> that<00:02:16.070> great

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
to know that they're not that great

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.790 
to know that they're not that great
Jimmy<00:02:17.210> then<00:02:17.660> you<00:02:18.050> can't<00:02:18.290> really<00:02:18.440> hear<00:02:18.680> them

Jimmy then you can't really hear them
that<00:02:18.950> well<00:02:19.130> in<00:02:19.550> my<00:02:19.760> opinion<00:02:19.880> at<00:02:20.270> least<00:02:20.300> but<00:02:21.170> I

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
that well in my opinion at least but I

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.260 
that well in my opinion at least but I
definitely<00:02:21.530> think<00:02:21.920> this<00:02:22.190> will<00:02:22.460> be<00:02:22.640> awesome<00:02:22.880> to

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
definitely think this will be awesome to

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.380 
definitely think this will be awesome to
play<00:02:23.300> again<00:02:23.810> if<00:02:24.320> we<00:02:24.590> do<00:02:24.800> play<00:02:25.100> it<00:02:25.220> again<00:02:25.430> but<00:02:26.240> on

play again if we do play it again but on

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.840 
play again if we do play it again but on

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
another thing I want to say is many

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.280 
another thing I want to say is many
people<00:02:29.090> are<00:02:29.180> going<00:02:29.270> to<00:02:29.360> say<00:02:29.480> it<00:02:29.660> was<00:02:29.780> at<00:02:29.900> extra

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
people are going to say it was at extra

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.460 
people are going to say it was at extra
glitch<00:02:30.530> and<00:02:30.800> that's<00:02:31.370> not<00:02:31.580> actually<00:02:32.470> Griffin

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
glitch and that's not actually Griffin

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.350 
glitch and that's not actually Griffin
station<00:02:33.920> and<00:02:34.100> I<00:02:34.490> totally<00:02:34.700> agree<00:02:34.940> with<00:02:35.180> you

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
station and I totally agree with you

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.540 
station and I totally agree with you
from<00:02:36.020> when<00:02:36.320> they<00:02:36.440> first<00:02:36.470> created<00:02:37.070> the<00:02:37.160> moon<00:02:37.340> it

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
from when they first created the moon it

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.330 
from when they first created the moon it
probably<00:02:38.330> was<00:02:38.570> a<00:02:38.600> texture<00:02:39.140> glitch<00:02:39.350> and<00:02:39.590> when

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
probably was a texture glitch and when

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.190 
probably was a texture glitch and when
people<00:02:40.490> can't<00:02:40.940> say<00:02:41.270> hey<00:02:41.480> this<00:02:41.840> is<00:02:41.960> probably

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
people can't say hey this is probably

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.680 
people can't say hey this is probably
something<00:02:42.410> on<00:02:42.680> the<00:02:42.800> moon<00:02:42.950> I<00:02:43.160> think<00:02:43.700> Trek<00:02:44.390> just

put it on the moon let's let's bring
zombies<00:02:50.540> to<00:02:50.660> moon<00:02:50.840> and<00:02:51.080> when<00:02:51.590> black<00:02:51.830> ops<00:02:52.040> came

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
zombies to moon and when black ops came

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.400 
zombies to moon and when black ops came
out<00:02:52.490> it<00:02:52.730> was<00:02:52.760> the<00:02:53.030> big<00:02:53.270> bang<00:02:53.570> and<00:02:53.900> literally

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
out it was the big bang and literally
