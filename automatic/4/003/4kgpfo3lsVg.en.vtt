00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
health right a DC district was one of

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.170 
health right a DC district was one of
the<00:00:49.710> first<00:00:49.829> ones<00:00:50.100> that<00:00:50.250> we<00:00:50.370> did<00:00:50.550> that<00:00:50.670> with<00:00:50.879> and

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
the first ones that we did that with and

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.180 
the first ones that we did that with and
and<00:00:51.809> that<00:00:52.050> school<00:00:52.320> was<00:00:52.440> just<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.710> mile<00:00:52.890> down<00:00:53.070> the

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
and that school was just a mile down the

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.850 
and that school was just a mile down the
road<00:00:53.340> from<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.760> store<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.559> that<00:00:55.559> kind<00:00:55.800> of

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
road from the store and that kind of

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.410 
road from the store and that kind of
grew<00:00:56.129> into<00:00:56.160> this<00:00:56.550> idea<00:00:56.879> of<00:00:56.940> how<00:00:57.120> can<00:00:57.180> we

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
grew into this idea of how can we

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.770 
grew into this idea of how can we
specifically<00:00:58.170> help<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.100> schools<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.789> out<00:01:00.660> of

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
specifically help the schools and out of

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.540 
specifically help the schools and out of
that<00:01:00.899> idea<00:01:01.199> came<00:01:01.440> this<00:01:01.680> idea<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.219> salad

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
that idea came this idea of the salad

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.770 
that idea came this idea of the salad
bars<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:03.629> we<00:01:03.750> put<00:01:03.930> together<00:01:04.049> this<00:01:04.379> program<00:01:04.799> to

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
bars and we put together this program to

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.990 
bars and we put together this program to
to<00:01:06.780> help<00:01:06.930> schools<00:01:07.229> get<00:01:07.560> their<00:01:07.860> salad<00:01:08.520> bars<00:01:08.700> and

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
the training of how to put that into
