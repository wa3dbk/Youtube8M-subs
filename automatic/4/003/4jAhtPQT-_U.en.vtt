it's<00:00:46.100> pretty<00:00:46.310> fast<00:00:46.660> 72.3<00:00:47.660> it's<00:00:48.140> got<00:00:48.350> a

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:48.380 
it's pretty fast 72.3 it's got a

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:54.450 
it's pretty fast 72.3 it's got a
standard<00:00:49.220> 290<00:00:49.760> in<00:00:49.850> it

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.180 

right<00:00:55.460> with<00:00:55.610> a<00:00:55.790> theta<00:00:56.240> here<00:00:56.450> too<00:00:56.570> yep<00:00:57.350> are<00:00:57.980> on

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
right with a theta here too yep are on

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:14.620 
right with a theta here too yep are on
our<00:00:58.239> way<00:01:05.530> all<00:01:06.530> right<00:01:12.700> so<00:01:13.700> we<00:01:13.790> have<00:01:13.820> 3d<00:01:14.270> DC's

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
our way all right so we have 3d DC's

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.280 
our way all right so we have 3d DC's
meaning<00:01:15.080> there<00:01:15.229> have<00:01:15.590> hopefully<00:01:16.630> three<00:01:17.630> big

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
meaning there have hopefully three big

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.340 
meaning there have hopefully three big
