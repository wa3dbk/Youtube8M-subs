injuries<00:03:43.260> they<00:03:43.470> come<00:03:43.740> a<00:03:43.920> little<00:03:44.280> too

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
injuries they come a little too

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.780 
injuries they come a little too
frequently<00:03:45.180> for<00:03:45.420> me<00:03:45.620> so<00:03:46.620> Josh<00:03:46.920> shoot<00:03:47.160> was<00:03:47.250> 303

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
frequently for me so Josh shoot was 303

frequently for me so Josh shoot was 303
open<00:03:48.060> to<00:03:48.150> that<00:03:48.240> point<00:03:48.600> just<00:03:49.230> barely<00:03:49.530> avoids

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:50.460 
open to that point just barely avoids

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:53.060 
open to that point just barely avoids
throwing<00:03:50.880> the<00:03:50.970> int<00:03:51.540> and<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:52.440> team<00:03:52.680> is<00:03:52.890> in

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
throwing the int and the team is in

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:54.860 
throwing the int and the team is in
range<00:03:53.400> for<00:03:53.670> a<00:03:53.700> field<00:03:53.940> goal<00:03:54.000> again<00:03:54.480> and<00:03:54.660> as<00:03:54.750> you

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
range for a field goal again and as you

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.750 
range for a field goal again and as you
can<00:03:55.020> see<00:03:55.050> they<00:03:55.260> cannot<00:03:55.680> make<00:03:55.950> it<00:03:56.160> so<00:03:56.580> it's<00:03:56.700> a

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
can see they cannot make it so it's a

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.760 
can see they cannot make it so it's a
10-0<00:03:57.330> game<00:03:57.570> with<00:03:57.810> a<00:03:57.840> few<00:03:58.050> seconds<00:03:58.500> left<00:03:58.590> before

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
the half it's pretty safe to say is

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.300 
the half it's pretty safe to say is
going<00:04:00.900> to<00:04:00.990> be<00:04:01.050> a<00:04:01.080> 10-0<00:04:01.680> game<00:04:01.890> at<00:04:02.070> the<00:04:02.160> half

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310
