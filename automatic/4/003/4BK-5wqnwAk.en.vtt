thinking about it I realized you know
what<00:00:38.280> I<00:00:38.309> really<00:00:38.969> don't<00:00:39.000> even<00:00:39.390> know<00:00:39.480> that<00:00:39.510> much

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
what I really don't even know that much

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.420 
what I really don't even know that much
about<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.320> rotator<00:00:40.620> cuff<00:00:40.710> I<00:00:41.040> mean<00:00:41.190> what

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
about the rotator cuff I mean what

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.240 
about the rotator cuff I mean what
exactly<00:00:42.420> does<00:00:42.660> it<00:00:42.719> consist<00:00:43.200> of<00:00:43.440> what's<00:00:43.680> what's

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
exactly does it consist of what's what's

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.150 
exactly does it consist of what's what's
its<00:00:44.460> purpose<00:00:44.700> what<00:00:45.239> what<00:00:45.719> does<00:00:45.840> it<00:00:45.960> mean<00:00:46.230> when

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
its purpose what what does it mean when

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.950 
its purpose what what does it mean when
you<00:00:47.309> tear<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.670> rotator<00:00:47.850> cuff<00:00:48.390> what<00:00:48.809> are<00:00:48.870> you

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
you tear a rotator cuff what are you

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.680 
you tear a rotator cuff what are you
actually<00:00:49.260> caring<00:00:49.760> and<00:00:50.760> why<00:00:51.000> does<00:00:51.270> it<00:00:51.420> seem

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
actually caring and why does it seem

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.619 
actually caring and why does it seem
that<00:00:51.829> you<00:00:52.829> know<00:00:52.920> strong<00:00:53.579> healthy<00:00:54.210> athletes

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
that you know strong healthy athletes

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.510 
that you know strong healthy athletes
are<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.899> ones<00:00:55.079> who<00:00:55.230> are<00:00:55.260> always<00:00:55.649> prone<00:00:56.280> to

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
are the ones who are always prone to

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.849 
are the ones who are always prone to
injury<00:00:56.910> so<00:00:57.899> I<00:00:57.960> decided<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.410> do<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.530> little<00:00:58.710> bit

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
injury so I decided to do a little bit

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.590 
injury so I decided to do a little bit
of<00:00:58.890> researching<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.670> actually<00:01:00.390> as<00:01:00.480> an

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
of researching and actually as an

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.349 
of researching and actually as an
unexpected<00:01:01.230> side<00:01:01.440> result<00:01:01.770> I've<00:01:01.920> I've<00:01:02.359> gotten

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
unexpected side result I've I've gotten

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.509 
unexpected side result I've I've gotten
better<00:01:03.510> at<00:01:03.750> my<00:01:04.019> ability<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.589> visualize<00:01:05.280> the

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
better at my ability to visualize the

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.740 
better at my ability to visualize the
different<00:01:05.850> components<00:01:06.270> of<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.450> shoulder

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
different components of the shoulder

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.570 
different components of the shoulder
girdle<00:01:06.780> especially<00:01:07.500> when<00:01:08.250> I'm<00:01:08.340> doing

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
girdle especially when I'm doing

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.520 
girdle especially when I'm doing
something<00:01:08.970> like<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.090> scapular<00:01:09.869> wide<00:01:10.080> view<00:01:10.380> or

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
something like a scapular wide view or

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.899 
something like a scapular wide view or
an<00:01:11.100> axillary<00:01:11.580> x-ray<00:01:12.510> of<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.689> shoulder<00:01:13.909> so

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
an axillary x-ray of the shoulder so

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.770 
an axillary x-ray of the shoulder so
anyway<00:01:15.330> what<00:01:15.810> exactly<00:01:16.320> is<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.770> rotator<00:01:17.159> cuff

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
anyway what exactly is the rotator cuff

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.530 
anyway what exactly is the rotator cuff
very<00:01:18.780> simply<00:01:19.200> it's<00:01:19.380> four<00:01:20.189> muscles<00:01:20.460> that<00:01:21.030> hold

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
very simply it's four muscles that hold

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.810 
very simply it's four muscles that hold
the<00:01:21.780> shoulder<00:01:22.110> joint<00:01:22.380> in<00:01:22.470> place<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.950> they

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
the shoulder joint in place and they

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.080 
the shoulder joint in place and they
also<00:01:24.060> assist<00:01:24.900> in<00:01:25.140> abduction<00:01:25.979> of<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.430> shoulder

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
also assist in abduction of the shoulder

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.609 
also assist in abduction of the shoulder
as<00:01:27.270> well<00:01:27.720> as<00:01:27.930> internal<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.590> external
