00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:07.690
 I was picked up easy with braids 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.539
 in the first option we will take a lock 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.449
 from the top of one side and what 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.060
 we will divide into four partitions the 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.910
 tuft of the end passes down by 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.739
 above and below and the last lock 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.740
 that we have left in second place goes through 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:35.000
 below and above we take the second 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:39.690
 tuft and passes over and under 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:43.220
 below and above and we do what 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.220
 same at each crossing 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.740
 we braid the whole lock and tie the 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.680
 braid with a small rubber pinch 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:58.200
 moss we make it bigger 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.330
 we take the lock of the other side we do 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.970
 four partitions and we're going to take the 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:07.080
 tuft of the end we pass underneath 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:09.000
 and we cross it over and under and 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.010
 the last lock is in second 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.890
 place and we pass it below 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:17.500
 and above we take the second lock and 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:20.770
 we passed it over 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.370
 and below and we do the same in each 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.370
 crossing 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.469
 we tempt the whole lock and tie the 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.820
 braid with a small rubber the fur coat 

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:42.370
 we open it 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:46.470
 and we can catch the two braids crossing 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.470
 the and hold them with hairpins 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.780
 and it will be nice 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:58.290
 we can also take the two braids and 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.290
 tie them with a small rubber 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.229
 we can leave it like this 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.799
 or remove the two small rubber bands and leave 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.799
 the loose ponytail 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.640
 in the third option we make a braid 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.240
 in normal with the top part of a 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.460
 side 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:25.240
 we tie it with a small rubber band and 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:29.400
 we make a braid below and in the 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.400
 another side we make two more braids 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.330
 now we take the two braids from above 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.240
 and we join them in the center we take the 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:40.210
 230 below and tie them over 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:42.580
 and ready 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:45.790
 and as before we can also undo 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.410
 the braids of the queue what option is 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.050
