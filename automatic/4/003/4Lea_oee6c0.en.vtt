here is a double-quoted polyethylene

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.309 
here is a double-quoted polyethylene
material<00:02:28.150> so<00:02:28.660> it's<00:02:28.750> really<00:02:28.900> tough<00:02:29.170> and

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
material so it's really tough and

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.140 
material so it's really tough and
durable<00:02:29.530> and<00:02:30.130> also<00:02:30.310> has<00:02:30.580> a<00:02:30.610> minimum

millimeters<00:02:33.040> and<00:02:33.280> this<00:02:33.370> just<00:02:33.580> toggles<00:02:33.940> into

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
millimeters and this just toggles into

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.690 
millimeters and this just toggles into
position<00:02:34.600> in<00:02:34.750> here<00:02:34.980> then<00:02:35.980> when<00:02:36.250> you<00:02:36.340> step<00:02:36.520> back

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.710 
chilly a real nice feature here is that
if<00:02:51.220> you<00:02:51.340> want<00:02:51.520> to<00:02:51.640> we<00:02:51.880> can<00:02:52.030> simply<00:02:52.330> open<00:02:52.420> up

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
if you want to we can simply open up

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.470 
if you want to we can simply open up
this<00:02:52.930> whole<00:02:53.470> door<00:02:53.769> right<00:02:54.400> the<00:02:54.519> way<00:02:54.610> across<00:02:54.850> to

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
this whole door right the way across to

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.560 
this whole door right the way across to
create<00:02:55.900> one<00:02:56.200> large<00:02:56.680> open<00:02:56.950> space<00:02:57.550> or<00:02:57.820> obviously

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
create one large open space or obviously

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.390 
create one large open space or obviously
it<00:02:58.690> can<00:02:58.870> be<00:02:58.989> fully<00:02:59.380> closed<00:02:59.709> over<00:03:00.040> to<00:03:00.190> the<00:03:00.280> other

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
it can be fully closed over to the other

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.090 
it can be fully closed over to the other
side<00:03:00.670> as<00:03:01.000> well<00:03:01.209> so<00:03:01.510> when<00:03:02.380> we<00:03:02.470> step<00:03:02.650> back<00:03:02.890> into

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
side as well so when we step back into

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.380 
side as well so when we step back into
the<00:03:03.310> tent<00:03:03.550> something<00:03:04.000> that<00:03:04.090> you're<00:03:04.209> very

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
aware of is just how much space there is

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.190 
aware of is just how much space there is
there's<00:03:06.760> a<00:03:06.820> lots<00:03:07.450> and<00:03:07.630> lots<00:03:07.750> of<00:03:07.840> head<00:03:08.019> height

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
there's a lots and lots of head height

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.590 
there's a lots and lots of head height
in<00:03:08.320> here<00:03:08.560> you<00:03:08.680> can<00:03:08.830> see<00:03:08.950> I'm<00:03:09.130> 1<00:03:09.370> meter<00:03:09.610> 95<00:03:10.209> and<00:03:10.540> I

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
in here you can see I'm 1 meter 95 and I

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
is really accentuated by the large

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:16.650 
is really accentuated by the large
windows<00:03:15.489> that<00:03:15.519> we<00:03:15.700> have<00:03:15.850> all<00:03:16.120> the<00:03:16.269> way<00:03:16.390> around

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
windows that we have all the way around

the tent and just on this side here you
can<00:03:18.670> see<00:03:18.820> that<00:03:19.300> each<00:03:19.570> window<00:03:20.019> has<00:03:20.230> its<00:03:20.260> own

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.289 
can see that each window has its own
curtain<00:03:20.950> so<00:03:21.100> we've<00:03:21.220> just<00:03:21.430> closed<00:03:21.940> this<00:03:22.120> one

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
curtain so we've just closed this one

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:23.699 
curtain so we've just closed this one
over<00:03:22.510> at<00:03:22.630> the<00:03:22.720> moment<00:03:23.019> just<00:03:23.170> to<00:03:23.260> show<00:03:23.410> you<00:03:23.470> that

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
but that can be either toggled halfway

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.470 
but that can be either toggled halfway
or<00:03:25.959> obviously<00:03:26.829> fully<00:03:27.070> opened<00:03:27.489> up<00:03:27.610> as<00:03:27.760> well<00:03:27.910> and

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
then across the top of all the windows

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:31.650 
then across the top of all the windows
we<00:03:30.010> have<00:03:30.040> the<00:03:30.340> mesh<00:03:30.519> ventilation<00:03:30.880> that

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
we have the mesh ventilation that

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.390 
we have the mesh ventilation that
corresponds<00:03:32.200> to<00:03:32.290> the<00:03:32.500> outside<00:03:32.680> ventilation

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
corresponds to the outside ventilation

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.819 
corresponds to the outside ventilation
that<00:03:33.489> we<00:03:33.640> mentioned<00:03:34.000> earlier<00:03:34.120> on<00:03:34.560> at<00:03:35.560> the<00:03:35.650> top

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
lantern hanging point and this just

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.270 
lantern hanging point and this just
leads<00:03:39.640> away<00:03:40.170> here<00:03:41.170> with<00:03:41.560> the<00:03:41.680> cable<00:03:41.980> tidies

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
leads away here with the cable tidies

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.180 
leads away here with the cable tidies
down<00:03:42.549> to<00:03:42.760> our<00:03:43.030> cable<00:03:43.420> entry<00:03:43.630> point<00:03:43.950> this<00:03:44.950> just

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
down to our cable entry point this just

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.280 
down to our cable entry point this just
allows<00:03:45.340> us<00:03:45.579> to<00:03:45.850> bring<00:03:46.180> in<00:03:46.360> any<00:03:46.570> electrics<00:03:47.110> or

bugs<00:04:00.850> coming<00:04:01.180> into<00:04:01.390> the<00:04:01.570> tent<00:04:01.810> just<00:04:02.160> so<00:04:03.160> you

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
bugs coming into the tent just so you

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:04.680 
bugs coming into the tent just so you
know<00:04:03.280> the<00:04:03.459> grain<00:04:03.640> sheet<00:04:03.880> in<00:04:03.970> this<00:04:04.150> area<00:04:04.420> is<00:04:04.570> the

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
know the grain sheet in this area is the

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.180 
know the grain sheet in this area is the
exact<00:04:04.959> same<00:04:05.140> material<00:04:05.290> that<00:04:05.650> we<00:04:05.739> mentioned<00:04:06.100> in

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
exact same material that we mentioned in

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.500 
exact same material that we mentioned in
the<00:04:06.310> front<00:04:06.549> area<00:04:06.730> the<00:04:06.970> only<00:04:07.150> difference<00:04:07.450> here

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
the front area the only difference here

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.240 
the front area the only difference here
is<00:04:07.630> that<00:04:07.780> it's<00:04:07.930> fully<00:04:08.200> sealed<00:04:08.470> in<00:04:08.709> so<00:04:09.010> again

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
is that it's fully sealed in so again

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.350 
is that it's fully sealed in so again
you're<00:04:09.400> not<00:04:09.489> going<00:04:09.640> to<00:04:09.700> get<00:04:09.820> any<00:04:09.940> drafts

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
you're not going to get any drafts

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.960 
you're not going to get any drafts
coming<00:04:10.600> in<00:04:10.780> along<00:04:11.290> the<00:04:11.440> bottom<00:04:11.590> and<00:04:12.130> hopefully

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
coming in along the bottom and hopefully

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.430 
coming in along the bottom and hopefully
again<00:04:13.060> it's<00:04:13.750> going<00:04:13.930> to<00:04:13.989> keep<00:04:14.109> out<00:04:14.260> those

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
again it's going to keep out those

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.219 
again it's going to keep out those
unwanted<00:04:14.709> bugs<00:04:15.419> at<00:04:16.419> the<00:04:16.510> back<00:04:16.690> of<00:04:16.720> the<00:04:16.900> tent<00:04:17.079> is

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:17.229 
unwanted bugs at the back of the tent is

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:18.810 
unwanted bugs at the back of the tent is
where<00:04:17.410> you'll<00:04:17.560> find<00:04:17.739> at<00:04:17.950> the<00:04:17.979> bedrooms<00:04:18.459> and<00:04:18.669> as
