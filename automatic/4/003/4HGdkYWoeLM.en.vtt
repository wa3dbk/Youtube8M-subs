up at altitude and they actually they

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.950 
up at altitude and they actually they

difficult to tell but a lot depends you

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.960 
difficult to tell but a lot depends you
know<00:01:03.270> people<00:01:03.660> don't<00:01:04.559> understand<00:01:05.519> how<00:01:05.700> very

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
know people don't understand how very

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.789 
know people don't understand how very
important<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.510> is<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.869> have<00:01:06.900> those<00:01:07.200> identifier

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
important it is to have those identifier

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.010 
important it is to have those identifier
codes<00:01:08.220> identifying<00:01:09.000> your<00:01:09.180> aircraft<00:01:09.720> there's

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
codes identifying your aircraft there's

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.899 
codes identifying your aircraft there's
a<00:01:10.080> civilian<00:01:10.560> aircraft<00:01:11.040> she's<00:01:11.430> very<00:01:11.640> very

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
a civilian aircraft she's very very

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.109 
a civilian aircraft she's very very
important<00:01:12.510> so<00:01:12.750> there<00:01:13.530> may<00:01:13.770> be<00:01:14.119> similarity

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
important so there may be similarity

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.380 
important so there may be similarity
between<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.780> disappearance<00:01:16.470> in<00:01:16.650> terms<00:01:16.890> of

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
between the disappearance in terms of

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.760 
between the disappearance in terms of
identification<00:01:18.390> of<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.540> plane<00:01:18.810> etcetera<00:01:19.409> but

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
identification of the plane etcetera but

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.280 
identification of the plane etcetera but
at<00:01:20.180> 32,000<00:01:21.180> feet<00:01:21.210> there's<00:01:21.509> no<00:01:21.689> reason<00:01:22.110> to

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
at 32,000 feet there's no reason to

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.380 
at 32,000 feet there's no reason to
demonstrate<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.189> jetliner<00:01:23.549> be<00:01:23.850> very<00:01:24.150> difficult

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
demonstrate a jetliner be very difficult

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.590 
demonstrate a jetliner be very difficult
for<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:24.960> do<00:01:25.170> harm<00:01:25.500> on<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.830> ground<00:01:26.600> 280

of the hostilities there is that an area

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.830 
of the hostilities there is that an area
where<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:58.979> commercial<00:01:59.640> airline<00:02:00.119> should<00:02:00.689> be

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
where a commercial airline should be

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.639 
where a commercial airline should be
flying<00:02:01.200> over<00:02:01.439> at<00:02:01.829> all<00:02:02.780> you<00:02:03.780> know<00:02:03.899> I<00:02:03.930> wish<00:02:04.439> that

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
flying over at all you know I wish that

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:05.749 
flying over at all you know I wish that
they<00:02:04.799> had<00:02:04.920> thought<00:02:05.130> of<00:02:05.159> that<00:02:05.369> ahead<00:02:05.610> of<00:02:05.640> time

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
they had thought of that ahead of time

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.370 
they had thought of that ahead of time
but<00:02:06.090> yeah<00:02:06.270> there's<00:02:06.540> it's<00:02:06.689> there<00:02:06.960> are<00:02:07.140> roots

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
but yeah there's it's there are roots

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.800 
but yeah there's it's there are roots
there<00:02:07.649> that<00:02:07.860> they<00:02:07.950> can<00:02:08.129> fly<00:02:08.340> but<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.149> the

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
there that they can fly but the the

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.020 
there that they can fly but the the
challenge<00:02:10.560> is<00:02:10.830> that<00:02:11.099> when<00:02:11.370> they<00:02:11.580> when<00:02:11.879> there's

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
challenge is that when they when there's

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.260 
challenge is that when they when there's
a<00:02:12.090> conflict<00:02:12.390> going<00:02:12.660> on<00:02:12.840> there's<00:02:13.080> no

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
a conflict going on there's no

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.850 
a conflict going on there's no
restricted<00:02:13.720> roots<00:02:13.930> they<00:02:14.170> supposed<00:02:14.500> to<00:02:14.620> say

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
restricted roots they supposed to say

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.740 
restricted roots they supposed to say
hey<00:02:15.340> these<00:02:15.550> studies<00:02:15.880> are<00:02:15.910> safe<00:02:16.300> they<00:02:16.510> can<00:02:16.660> go

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
hey these studies are safe they can go

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.420 
hey these studies are safe they can go
through<00:02:16.960> here<00:02:17.110> without<00:02:17.230> any<00:02:17.500> problem<00:02:17.890> now

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
through here without any problem now

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.210 
through here without any problem now
with<00:02:19.210> regard<00:02:19.450> to<00:02:19.720> the<00:02:20.110> you<00:02:20.740> know<00:02:20.800> being<00:02:21.010> shot

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
with regard to the you know being shot

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.040 
with regard to the you know being shot
down<00:02:21.430> or<00:02:21.490> not<00:02:21.760> marry<00:02:22.000> meri's<00:02:22.540> point<00:02:22.750> was<00:02:22.870> good

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
down or not marry meri's point was good

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.660 
down or not marry meri's point was good
about<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.440> fact<00:02:23.620> that<00:02:23.770> it<00:02:24.010> did<00:02:24.220> at<00:02:24.640> that

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
about the fact that it did at that

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.520 
about the fact that it did at that
altitude<00:02:25.030> it<00:02:25.510> shouldn't<00:02:25.810> be<00:02:25.900> involved<00:02:26.200> in

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
altitude it shouldn't be involved in

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:27.840 
altitude it shouldn't be involved in
that<00:02:26.680> conflict<00:02:27.010> and<00:02:27.250> it<00:02:27.340> should<00:02:27.490> be<00:02:27.580> a<00:02:27.610> safe

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
that conflict and it should be a safe

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.210 
that conflict and it should be a safe
altitude<00:02:28.030> to<00:02:28.420> be<00:02:28.540> at<00:02:28.690> and<00:02:29.040> remember<00:02:30.040> too<00:02:30.190> that

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
altitude to be at and remember too that

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.430 
altitude to be at and remember too that
ground-to-air<00:02:30.990> missiles<00:02:31.990> really<00:02:32.260> aren't

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
ground-to-air missiles really aren't

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.260 
ground-to-air missiles really aren't
designed<00:02:32.710> for<00:02:33.100> that<00:02:33.220> high<00:02:33.700> of<00:02:33.880> an<00:02:33.970> altitude

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
designed for that high of an altitude

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:35.970 
designed for that high of an altitude
there's<00:02:34.690> some<00:02:34.900> very<00:02:35.080> specialized<00:02:35.590> ones<00:02:35.800> that

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
there's some very specialized ones that

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.220 
there's some very specialized ones that
are<00:02:36.100> but<00:02:36.310> in<00:02:36.400> this<00:02:36.520> particular<00:02:37.000> conflict<00:02:37.630> it's

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
are but in this particular conflict it's

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.470 
are but in this particular conflict it's
not<00:02:38.410> that<00:02:38.470> sophisticated<00:02:38.830> these<00:02:39.550> you'd<00:02:40.330> be

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
not that sophisticated these you'd be

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.080 
not that sophisticated these you'd be
looking<00:02:40.600> at<00:02:40.900> small
