the candle the wax melted pulled out and

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.870 
the candle the wax melted pulled out and
about<00:02:25.570> let's<00:02:25.810> say<00:02:26.160> 15<00:02:27.160> minutes<00:02:27.460> for<00:02:27.550> this<00:02:27.670> one

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880

each and every single time and then the

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.530 
each and every single time and then the
throw<00:02:30.580> kicked<00:02:30.730> in<00:02:30.910> right<00:02:31.000> then<00:02:31.300> and<00:02:31.360> there<00:02:31.420> is

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
into gear I'm about let's say 20 to 30

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.620 
into gear I'm about let's say 20 to 30
minutes<00:02:36.160> top<00:02:36.460> for<00:02:36.730> the<00:02:36.850> full<00:02:37.060> effect<00:02:37.390> for<00:02:37.600> the

minutes top for the full effect for the

minutes top for the full effect for the
whole<00:02:37.780> candle<00:02:38.230> um<00:02:39.390> it's<00:02:40.390> great<00:02:40.720> wax<00:02:41.710> melts

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
whole candle um it's great wax melts

whole candle um it's great wax melts
pulls<00:02:42.700> out<00:02:42.910> evenly<00:02:43.360> it's<00:02:43.900> consistent<00:02:44.800> like

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
pulls out evenly it's consistent like

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.670 
pulls out evenly it's consistent like
the<00:02:45.730> wax<00:02:46.000> does<00:02:46.240> not<00:02:46.390> change<00:02:46.630> colors<00:02:47.140> it<00:02:47.500> does

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
the wax does not change colors it does

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.780 
the wax does not change colors it does
not<00:02:47.860> turn<00:02:48.190> a<00:02:48.520> key<00:02:49.120> gray<00:02:49.480> brown<00:02:50.340> purple<00:02:51.340> green

not turn a key gray brown purple green

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.680 
not turn a key gray brown purple green
into<00:02:52.060> stays<00:02:52.740> consistently<00:02:53.740> white<00:02:53.980> and<00:02:54.690> it's

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
into stays consistently white and it's

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.830 
into stays consistently white and it's
great<00:02:56.110> and<00:02:56.320> I<00:02:56.560> guess<00:02:56.800> repeat<00:02:57.160> steps<00:02:57.520> and<00:02:58.150> I<00:02:58.690> had

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
great and I guess repeat steps and I had

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.950 
great and I guess repeat steps and I had
the<00:02:58.930> candle<00:02:59.260> burning<00:02:59.440> for<00:02:59.770> about<00:03:00.090> maybe<00:03:01.090> four

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:01.960 
the candle burning for about maybe four

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.680 
the candle burning for about maybe four
to<00:03:02.080> five<00:03:02.230> hours<00:03:02.260> each<00:03:02.830> time<00:03:02.860> so<00:03:03.580> it's<00:03:04.450> like<00:03:04.660> I

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
to five hours each time so it's like I

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.920 
to five hours each time so it's like I
said<00:03:04.900> consistence<00:03:05.470> perfect<00:03:05.980> so<00:03:06.340> day<00:03:07.060> 23<00:03:07.450> and

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
said consistence perfect so day 23 and

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.310 
said consistence perfect so day 23 and
today<00:03:08.410> repeat<00:03:09.010> step<00:03:09.280> 1<00:03:09.550> and<00:03:10.320> everything's

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
it's like done it's like perfect the

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.440

flames<00:03:20.680> were<00:03:21.010> like<00:03:21.190> super<00:03:21.520> high<00:03:21.850> when<00:03:22.120> I<00:03:22.150> let

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
flames were like super high when I let

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.000 
flames were like super high when I let
them<00:03:22.600> they<00:03:22.720> were<00:03:22.810> dancing<00:03:22.959> wickedly<00:03:23.650> high<00:03:23.830> in

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
them they were dancing wickedly high in

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.820 
them they were dancing wickedly high in
um<00:03:24.870> when<00:03:25.870> the<00:03:25.989> candle<00:03:26.320> was<00:03:26.440> kind<00:03:26.680> of<00:03:26.709> like

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
um when the candle was kind of like

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.530 
um when the candle was kind of like
going<00:03:27.070> on<00:03:27.280> it<00:03:27.430> had<00:03:27.550> mushroom<00:03:27.910> tops<00:03:28.120> and<00:03:28.450> the

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
going on it had mushroom tops and the

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.750 
going on it had mushroom tops and the
mushroom<00:03:28.840> top<00:03:29.050> always<00:03:29.860> like<00:03:30.100> little<00:03:30.580> bitty

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
mushroom top always like little bitty

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.340 
mushroom top always like little bitty
ball<00:03:30.970> upset<00:03:31.270> that<00:03:31.450> forms<00:03:31.840> at<00:03:31.930> the<00:03:31.989> tip<00:03:32.170> of<00:03:32.200> the

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
ball upset that forms at the tip of the

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.310 
ball upset that forms at the tip of the
wick<00:03:32.530> little<00:03:33.430> black<00:03:33.610> ball<00:03:34.570> of<00:03:34.720> mass<00:03:34.900> I<00:03:35.110> guess

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
wick little black ball of mass I guess

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.199 
wick little black ball of mass I guess
it<00:03:35.890> always<00:03:36.160> helps<00:03:36.489> to<00:03:36.550> ensure<00:03:36.670> that<00:03:37.000> thumbs

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
it always helps to ensure that thumbs

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:38.640 
it always helps to ensure that thumbs
going<00:03:37.390> to<00:03:37.450> get<00:03:37.540> a<00:03:37.570> lot<00:03:37.720> bigger<00:03:37.930> thicker<00:03:38.470> and

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
going to get a lot bigger thicker and

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.970 
going to get a lot bigger thicker and
wider<00:03:38.709> giving<00:03:39.130> a<00:03:39.250> better<00:03:40.410> consistent<00:03:41.410> burn

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
wider giving a better consistent burn

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.710 
wider giving a better consistent burn
and<00:03:42.190> throw<00:03:42.220> usually<00:03:43.060> not<00:03:43.209> really<00:03:43.480> for<00:03:43.600> the

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
and throw usually not really for the

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.680 
and throw usually not really for the
throw<00:03:43.959> but<00:03:44.170> I<00:03:44.350> like<00:03:44.500> to<00:03:44.590> think<00:03:44.739> so<00:03:44.830> but<00:03:45.690> mostly

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
throw but I like to think so but mostly

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.850 
throw but I like to think so but mostly
for<00:03:46.810> the<00:03:47.520> burn<00:03:48.520> so<00:03:49.200> yeah<00:03:50.200> it's<00:03:50.560> pretty<00:03:50.739> good

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
for the burn so yeah it's pretty good
