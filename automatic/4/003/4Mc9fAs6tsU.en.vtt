00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
is only purely for the reason that there

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.250 
is only purely for the reason that there
are<00:00:40.739> huge<00:00:41.309> amounts<00:00:41.879> of<00:00:42.180> titles<00:00:42.629> on<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:42.899> PSP

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
resistance 1 and it was the first game I
