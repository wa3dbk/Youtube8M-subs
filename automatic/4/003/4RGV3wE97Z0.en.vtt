00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
boomer I have taken a lot of clinics but

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.920 
boomer I have taken a lot of clinics but
this<00:01:55.530> is<00:01:55.710> definitely<00:01:56.160> the<00:01:56.520> best<00:01:56.750> there<00:01:57.750> are

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
this is definitely the best there are

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.109 
this is definitely the best there are
some<00:01:58.140> elements<00:01:58.350> that<00:01:58.770> I've<00:01:59.100> been<00:01:59.610> told<00:01:59.850> before

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
some elements that I've been told before

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.620 
some elements that I've been told before
but<00:02:00.690> never<00:02:00.840> as<00:02:01.140> clearly<00:02:01.530> or<00:02:01.890> as<00:02:02.040> well<00:02:02.630> drifting

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
but never as clearly or as well drifting

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.389 
but never as clearly or as well drifting
is<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.930> new<00:02:04.110> concept<00:02:04.800> that<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:05.160> haven't<00:02:05.610> had

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
is the new concept that I haven't had

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:10.460 
is the new concept that I haven't had
140<00:02:08.399> years<00:02:08.640> but<00:02:09.360> what's<00:02:09.570> happening<00:02:10.110> is<00:02:10.290> you

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
140 years but what's happening is you

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.420 
140 years but what's happening is you
can't<00:02:10.740> drift<00:02:11.130> less<00:02:11.459> you're<00:02:11.640> on<00:02:11.730> top

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
can't drift less you're on top

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.740 
can't drift less you're on top
everything<00:02:14.430> else<00:02:14.790> I've<00:02:15.000> been<00:02:15.150> told<00:02:15.390> here<00:02:15.630> I've

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
everything else I've been told here I've

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
me get on top of it and you can't make

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.290 
me get on top of it and you can't make
me<00:02:27.900> get<00:02:28.140> over<00:02:28.260> that<00:02:28.530> ski<00:02:28.950> this<00:02:29.310> was<00:02:29.580> the
