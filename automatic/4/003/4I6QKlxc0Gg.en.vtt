00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.210

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:36.210
 Generally how you downloaded 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:39.090
 you have to throw this one well let's say 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.610
 it's my gta 5 do not like me 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.409
 it makes no sense to download it with my hands 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.840
 number of bits while I'm here new 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.869

 guys raise well well in short it is 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.700
 for the glory of computers or there I do not know who 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.990
 wants to stream on too 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:13.400
 computer mood but still 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:16.310
 lags then this is exactly for you she cleans 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.739
 Such functions will tune in those that can not 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:22.330
 remove well let's say I give an example 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:25.700
 let's say injury removes and there is something else 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:30.140
 in short, completely 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:33.590

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:38.600
 thrown here and I run this one 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:42.769

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:45.530
 after you launched this launcher 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:49.310
 just go into the game and all voila it 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:54.290
 activated to remove this thing 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:57.260
