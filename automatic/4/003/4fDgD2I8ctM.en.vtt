the soldier in the field if you can
imagine<00:01:51.590> a<00:01:51.979> soldier<00:01:52.310> having<00:01:52.610> a<00:01:52.729> backpack<00:01:53.150> that

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
imagine a soldier having a backpack that

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.149 
imagine a soldier having a backpack that
would<00:01:53.479> basically<00:01:53.630> be<00:01:53.870> a<00:01:54.049> paper<00:01:54.320> battery<00:01:54.590> so<00:01:55.070> to

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
would basically be a paper battery so to

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:56.740 
would basically be a paper battery so to
speak<00:01:55.430> right<00:01:55.670> that<00:01:56.120> would<00:01:56.240> be<00:01:56.360> great<00:01:56.570> because

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
speak right that would be great because

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.960 
speak right that would be great because
