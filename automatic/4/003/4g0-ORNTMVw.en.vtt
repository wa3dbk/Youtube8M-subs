00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 ab at the time was good hi all the 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.690
 world here that she sleeps who is there with 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.660
 von acquired here who is in the process of 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.590
 film normally then today we 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.900
 makes you a video she is pretty 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.670
 special since it is neither a 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.800
 short film nor an episode of the trip 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.090
 a kevin we have our reasons we will 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.460
 explain everything today given 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.600
 it certainly is a problem which is 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.300
 actually happening is that you know it 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.369
 you saw that now there has been the 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.349
 patch from there a point 7.8 so the 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.760
 new versions and skins were 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.330
 updates let the skins have 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.099
 been updated 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.710
 is what actually makes you if you 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.440
 want to put a skin that is not 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.940
 patched so that is resulting from a 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.190
 version prior to the institute so 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.200
 all the skins of bolsin kevin the 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.000
 minecraft server mojang but an hour 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.350
 to the plo of a skin so in fact for 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.329
 summarize a little the shoe that can 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.950
 not change skins when you want so 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.899
 about short films 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.250
 it's really really disabling 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.539
 that is to say that to make one had 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.039
 planned to make a short film that 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.660
 had to last what three minutes 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.989
 besides, I still have the textures 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.730
 easter on me and good for changing the 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.899
 skins you have to wait an hour in fact 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.119
 you have to wait an hour before the 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.189
 SLUC starts the CCC is not possible 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.439
 we can not we can not do a short 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.869
 footage like that by filming an hour 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.130
 so we are really handicapped by 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.259
 report to that and that's what we wanted 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.790
 today make a video for you 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.259
 explain a little why 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.790
 nothing came out on the channel in this 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.500
 moment it is precisely it is especially 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.460
 it's mostly it's mostly for 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.259
 the trip did not have kevin that poses problem 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.150
 because the coming episode is pretty 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.380
 important and demanding because there 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.119
 characters arrive in a big 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.380
 city â€‹â€‹has a big city asks 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.750
 a lot of characters a lot of 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.460
 extras and a minimum of twenty 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.960
 extras and make wait twenty figure 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.119
 in an hour knowing that a may have 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.170
 that they will have to leave in the meantime and 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.210
 others who are going to arrive we will have to 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.860
 wait for them all and wait an hour 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.840
 every time and not without fun 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.500
 we have to find a way I'm on 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.659
 is looking for 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.610
 it's really a very very it's 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.869
 really very disabling for one speaks 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.070
 not for us necessarily there really 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.689
 other youtuber who work in 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.250
 precisely in in the footage on 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.680
 minecraft that trade unionists disability 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.550
 also 20 we tested to put 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.470
 our server in 1 7 9 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.260
 it works but the problem is that the 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.730
 7.9 the skins its boguey we can see 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.470
 our own style but we do not see 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:10.850
 the skin of others so we see the skin 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.560
 all the same kevin we do not see what 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.780
 even if they did not take took 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.290
 not his first without god of first 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.630
 sense of the word 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.450
 seeing that he continues yes yes 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.770
 but come back on absolutely sure 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.010
 impossible unthinkable of the decree of a 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.209
 paris series so 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.860
 it's time to say goodbye she 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.280
 adorn yeah bah yes yes but we have nothing 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.430
 else to say 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.560
 so I'm eating I'm disgusted ben 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.769
 I bury myself here in perthois then 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:39.180
 I was trying not nice to go to everything 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:39.180
 people and then to the next 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.569
