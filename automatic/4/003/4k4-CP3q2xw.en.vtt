about<00:00:37.380> it<00:00:37.590> so<00:00:37.710> much<00:00:37.860> people<00:00:38.160> are<00:00:38.219> kind<00:00:38.489> of

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
about it so much people are kind of

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:39.950 
about it so much people are kind of
saying<00:00:38.700> looks<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.300> little<00:00:39.390> bit<00:00:39.570> like<00:00:39.750> a

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
saying looks a little bit like a

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.600

side-scrolling<00:00:40.530> hotline<00:00:41.010> Miami

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
side-scrolling hotline Miami

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.350 
side-scrolling hotline Miami
this<00:00:42.510> is<00:00:42.690> katana<00:00:43.290> zero<00:00:43.739> alright<00:00:44.610> so<00:00:45.000> I<00:00:45.059> guess

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
this is katana zero alright so I guess

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.209 
this is katana zero alright so I guess
I'll<00:00:45.629> hop<00:00:45.780> right<00:00:45.930> into<00:00:46.110> this<00:00:46.350> you<00:00:47.010> were<00:00:47.100> gonna

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
I'll hop right into this you were gonna

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.130 
I'll hop right into this you were gonna
hop<00:00:47.489> right<00:00:47.700> in<00:00:47.820> I<00:00:48.329> think<00:00:48.660> people<00:00:48.989> will

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
hop right in I think people will

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.110 
hop right in I think people will
probably<00:00:49.680> make<00:00:50.100> those<00:00:50.280> comparisons<00:00:50.670> when<00:00:51.030> you

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
probably make those comparisons when you

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.430 
probably make those comparisons when you
start<00:00:51.329> seeing<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.660> action<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:52.230> because

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
start seeing the action of it because

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.889 
start seeing the action of it because
it's<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.620> mechanics<00:00:53.300> that<00:00:54.300> are<00:00:54.420> just<00:00:54.600> so

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
it's the mechanics that are just so

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.110 
it's the mechanics that are just so
vivid<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.410> real<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:55.829> it's<00:00:56.100> quite<00:00:56.430> violent<00:00:56.910> in

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
vivid and real and it's quite violent in

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.779 
vivid and real and it's quite violent in
the<00:00:57.329> best<00:00:57.600> way<00:00:57.809> possible<00:00:58.190> yeah<00:00:59.190> definitely

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
the best way possible yeah definitely

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.660

learning the basics of jumping mechanics
um<00:01:19.259> just<00:01:19.710> came<00:01:20.189> over<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.460> tutorial<00:01:20.909> here

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
much that we're learning about the story

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.980

yet but there's there's some elements to

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.210 
yet but there's there's some elements to
it<00:01:37.110> that<00:01:37.140> you'll<00:01:37.320> learn<00:01:37.439> about<00:01:37.560> later<00:01:37.829> on<00:01:38.070> as

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
it that you'll learn about later on as

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.190 
it that you'll learn about later on as
you<00:01:38.369> go<00:01:38.520> through<00:01:38.729> forth<00:01:39.299> yeah<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:39.960> little<00:01:40.140> bit

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
you go through forth yeah a little bit

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.450 
you go through forth yeah a little bit
more<00:01:40.259> about<00:01:40.619> like<00:01:40.770> what<00:01:40.950> you're<00:01:41.070> doing<00:01:41.220> and

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
more about like what you're doing and

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.889 
more about like what you're doing and
why<00:01:41.640> you're<00:01:41.820> murdering<00:01:42.210> all<00:01:42.390> these<00:01:42.540> people

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
why you're murdering all these people

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.120 
why you're murdering all these people
yeah<00:01:43.770> essentially<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.939> idea<00:01:45.119> is<00:01:45.829> in<00:01:46.829> every

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
yeah essentially the idea is in every

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.510 
yeah essentially the idea is in every
level<00:01:47.689> sorry<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:48.840> is<00:01:48.899> hard<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.380> talk<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.369> play

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
level sorry it is hard to talk and play

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.670 
level sorry it is hard to talk and play
this<00:01:50.670> difficult<00:01:51.090> game<00:01:51.240> at<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.479> same<00:01:51.659> time<00:01:51.899> but

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
this difficult game at the same time but

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.100 
this difficult game at the same time but
um<00:01:52.820> every<00:01:53.820> level<00:01:54.240> you're<00:01:54.390> sort<00:01:54.600> of<00:01:54.659> planning

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
um every level you're sort of planning

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.010 
um every level you're sort of planning
out<00:01:55.229> your<00:01:55.259> course<00:01:55.590> of<00:01:55.770> action<00:01:55.890> instead<00:01:56.640> of

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
out your course of action instead of

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.660 
out your course of action instead of
actually<00:01:58.020> doing<00:01:58.049> it<00:01:58.380> which<00:01:58.860> is<00:01:59.009> why<00:01:59.130> when<00:01:59.640> you

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
actually doing it which is why when you

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.609 
actually doing it which is why when you
fail<00:02:00.299> you're<00:02:00.570> like<00:02:00.719> no<00:02:00.960> that<00:02:01.229> plan<00:02:01.439> won't

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
fail you're like no that plan won't

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.170 
fail you're like no that plan won't
really<00:02:01.860> work<00:02:01.950> let<00:02:02.640> me<00:02:02.700> think<00:02:02.850> of<00:02:03.000> something

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
really work let me think of something

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.499 
really work let me think of something
else<00:02:03.799> and<00:02:04.799> for<00:02:05.369> that<00:02:05.460> exact<00:02:05.759> same<00:02:05.790> reason<00:02:06.000> I

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
else and for that exact same reason I

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.540 
else and for that exact same reason I
can<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:07.259> character<00:02:07.590> can<00:02:07.740> focus<00:02:07.979> hard<00:02:08.340> and

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
can the character can focus hard and

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.919 
can the character can focus hard and
actually<00:02:08.789> slow<00:02:08.940> down<00:02:09.179> time<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:09.599> Const

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
actually slow down time and Const

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.530 
actually slow down time and Const
trait<00:02:10.200> on<00:02:10.379> certain<00:02:10.799> points<00:02:11.159> okay<00:02:11.489> by<00:02:12.480> the

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
trait on certain points okay by the

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.690 
trait on certain points okay by the

meter in the upper middle of the screen

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.940 
meter in the upper middle of the screen
yes<00:02:15.319> and<00:02:16.340> so<00:02:17.340> now<00:02:17.849> that<00:02:17.909> you've<00:02:18.180> already

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
yes and so now that you've already

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.440 
yes and so now that you've already
figured<00:02:19.950> out<00:02:20.129> a<00:02:20.189> plan<00:02:20.400> that<00:02:20.519> would<00:02:21.030> work<00:02:21.180> well

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
figured out a plan that would work well

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.030 
figured out a plan that would work well
this<00:02:21.930> is<00:02:22.109> you<00:02:22.230> actually<00:02:22.590> going<00:02:22.769> out<00:02:22.980> and

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
this is you actually going out and

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.190 
this is you actually going out and
getting<00:02:23.549> the<00:02:23.700> plan<00:02:23.909> yeah<00:02:24.480> including<00:02:24.780> all<00:02:25.079> the

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
getting the plan yeah including all the

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.530 
getting the plan yeah including all the
slow-mo<00:02:25.620> parts<00:02:26.370> in<00:02:26.519> real<00:02:26.700> time<00:02:26.909> and<00:02:27.209> this<00:02:27.389> is

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
slow-mo parts in real time and this is

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.970 
slow-mo parts in real time and this is
sort<00:02:27.780> of<00:02:27.810> a<00:02:27.870> security<00:02:28.260> tape<00:02:28.409> so<00:02:28.590> you<00:02:28.620> can<00:02:28.709> fast

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
sort of a security tape so you can fast

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.069 
sort of a security tape so you can fast
road<00:02:29.250> you<00:02:29.340> can<00:02:29.489> rewind<00:02:29.790> it's<00:02:30.719> just<00:02:30.840> a<00:02:30.930> nice

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:31.079 
road you can rewind it's just a nice

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:32.750 
road you can rewind it's just a nice
little<00:02:31.260> treat<00:02:32.010> to<00:02:32.040> have<00:02:32.280> at<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:32.519> end<00:02:32.579> of<00:02:32.670> the

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
little treat to have at the end of the

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.399 
little treat to have at the end of the
level<00:02:32.939> after<00:02:33.209> doing<00:02:33.420> some<00:02:33.569> cool<00:02:33.840> stuff<00:02:33.900> its

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:34.409 
level after doing some cool stuff its

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:36.140 
level after doing some cool stuff its
stylized<00:02:34.920> in<00:02:35.099> a<00:02:35.159> great<00:02:35.400> way<00:02:35.579> that<00:02:35.819> lets<00:02:36.000> you

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
stylized in a great way that lets you

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.559 
stylized in a great way that lets you
kind<00:02:36.389> of<00:02:36.480> enjoy<00:02:37.109> what<00:02:37.409> you<00:02:37.500> just<00:02:37.799> did<00:02:38.159> I<00:02:39.120> think

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
kind of enjoy what you just did I think

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.599 
kind of enjoy what you just did I think
one<00:02:39.750> of<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:39.900> best<00:02:39.989> parts<00:02:40.319> yeah<00:02:40.590> is<00:02:40.859> that

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:41.609 
one of the best parts yeah is that

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:44.179 
one of the best parts yeah is that
really<00:02:41.970> nice<00:02:42.560> satisfaction<00:02:43.560> feeling<00:02:43.980> at<00:02:44.099> the

00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:44.189 
really nice satisfaction feeling at the

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:45.470 
really nice satisfaction feeling at the
end<00:02:44.220> when<00:02:44.489> you've<00:02:44.609> executed<00:02:44.970> something<00:02:45.299> that

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
end when you've executed something that

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.839 
end when you've executed something that
probably<00:02:45.629> took<00:02:46.079> you<00:02:46.230> a<00:02:46.530> hundred<00:02:46.859> tries<00:02:47.370> to<00:02:47.669> get

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
probably took you a hundred tries to get

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:50.030 
probably took you a hundred tries to get
right<00:02:48.060> at<00:02:48.299> something<00:02:48.510> now<00:02:49.290> you<00:02:49.349> you're<00:02:49.889> quite

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
right at something now you you're quite

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.500 
right at something now you you're quite
familiar<00:02:50.280> with<00:02:50.639> these<00:02:50.760> levels<00:02:50.970> but<00:02:51.239> a<00:02:51.269> lot<00:02:51.419> of

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
familiar with these levels but a lot of

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.479 
familiar with these levels but a lot of
these<00:02:51.569> people<00:02:51.780> it's<00:02:52.470> the<00:02:52.650> kind<00:02:52.889> of<00:02:52.980> thing<00:02:53.159> all

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
these people it's the kind of thing all

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.429 
these people it's the kind of thing all
right<00:02:53.790> so<00:02:53.970> you<00:02:54.060> can<00:02:54.209> smash<00:02:54.450> bullets<00:02:54.959> back<00:02:55.139> yeah

00:02:55.429 --> 00:02:55.439 
right so you can smash bullets back yeah

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:57.110 
right so you can smash bullets back yeah
you<00:02:55.680> can<00:02:55.829> do<00:02:55.919> that<00:02:56.099> too<00:02:56.310> this<00:02:56.669> is<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:56.790> kind<00:02:57.060> of

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
you can do that too this is the kind of

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.459 
you can do that too this is the kind of
thing<00:02:57.299> that<00:02:57.329> you're<00:02:57.719> gonna<00:02:57.810> have<00:02:58.109> to<00:02:58.290> die<00:02:58.439> in

00:02:58.459 --> 00:02:58.469 
thing that you're gonna have to die in

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:04.869 
thing that you're gonna have to die in
order<00:02:58.709> to<00:02:58.919> understand<00:02:59.280> what<00:02:59.459> to<00:02:59.579> do<00:02:59.700> next<00:02:59.969> time

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:04.879 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:06.979 

alright<00:03:05.879> so<00:03:05.969> here's<00:03:06.329> a<00:03:06.419> level<00:03:06.659> with<00:03:06.810> them

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
alright so here's a level with them

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:08.479 
alright so here's a level with them
slightly<00:03:07.590> more<00:03:07.739> interesting<00:03:07.950> mechanics

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
slightly more interesting mechanics

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:09.770 
slightly more interesting mechanics
because<00:03:08.760> all<00:03:08.969> these<00:03:09.150> enemies<00:03:09.299> are<00:03:09.480> gun

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
because all these enemies are gun

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.530 
because all these enemies are gun
wielders<00:03:10.200> as<00:03:10.379> you<00:03:10.919> kind<00:03:11.099> of<00:03:11.159> saw<00:03:11.310> last<00:03:11.579> level<00:03:11.939> I

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
wielders as you kind of saw last level I

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.080 
wielders as you kind of saw last level I
can<00:03:12.930> slash<00:03:13.230> bullets<00:03:13.620> back<00:03:13.919> and<00:03:14.220> that<00:03:14.790> does

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
can slash bullets back and that does

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.580 
can slash bullets back and that does
become<00:03:15.239> a<00:03:15.419> necessity<00:03:15.720> in<00:03:15.989> levels<00:03:16.229> like<00:03:16.409> this

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
become a necessity in levels like this

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.589 
become a necessity in levels like this
where<00:03:16.889> there's<00:03:17.489> just<00:03:17.699> a<00:03:17.790> hail<00:03:18.120> fire<00:03:18.329> or<00:03:18.569> a

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
where there's just a hail fire or a

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:25.970 
where there's just a hail fire or a
bullets<00:03:18.930> coming<00:03:19.079> at<00:03:19.260> you<00:03:19.379> at<00:03:19.470> all<00:03:19.560> times

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.070 

but<00:03:26.640> it<00:03:26.730> is<00:03:26.879> very<00:03:27.209> punishing<00:03:27.450> and<00:03:27.810> if<00:03:27.870> you<00:03:27.930> lose

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
but it is very punishing and if you lose

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.110 
but it is very punishing and if you lose
concentration<00:03:28.769> for<00:03:28.920> a<00:03:28.950> second<00:03:29.310> then<00:03:29.430> you're

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
concentration for a second then you're

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.369 
concentration for a second then you're
gonna<00:03:30.209> have<00:03:30.420> to<00:03:30.540> start<00:03:30.720> over<00:03:30.840> right<00:03:31.110> so<00:03:31.140> even

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:31.379 
gonna have to start over right so even

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:32.479 
gonna have to start over right so even
someone<00:03:31.739> who's<00:03:31.860> been<00:03:32.010> playing<00:03:32.099> this<00:03:32.340> for

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
someone who's been playing this for

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.280 
someone who's been playing this for
really<00:03:32.760> long<00:03:32.879> time<00:03:33.150> easily<00:03:33.569> connects<00:03:33.989> hugs

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
really long time easily connects hugs

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.580 
really long time easily connects hugs
playing<00:03:35.250> this<00:03:35.489> a<00:03:35.519> lot<00:03:35.870> but<00:03:36.870> that's<00:03:37.019> fine<00:03:37.260> right

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
playing this a lot but that's fine right

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.399 
playing this a lot but that's fine right
and<00:03:38.060> kind<00:03:39.060> of<00:03:39.209> again<00:03:39.360> similarly<00:03:39.810> a<00:03:39.959> hotline

00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:40.409 
and kind of again similarly a hotline

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:42.740 
and kind of again similarly a hotline
Miami<00:03:40.799> like<00:03:40.950> it's<00:03:41.099> okay<00:03:41.549> I<00:03:41.790> enjoy<00:03:42.239> failing

Miami like it's okay I enjoy failing
multiple<00:03:43.379> times<00:03:43.590> because<00:03:43.890> you<00:03:43.980> can<00:03:44.099> try

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
multiple times because you can try

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.229 
multiple times because you can try
different<00:03:44.459> routes<00:03:44.730> and<00:03:44.940> there's<00:03:45.120> different

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
different routes and there's different

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.259 
different routes and there's different
routes<00:03:45.540> that<00:03:45.780> can<00:03:46.110> succeed<00:03:46.470> as<00:03:46.650> well<00:03:46.680> so<00:03:47.370> this

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
routes that can succeed as well so this

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.360 
routes that can succeed as well so this
one<00:03:48.510> won't<00:03:48.780> we<00:03:49.200> know<00:03:49.319> might<00:03:49.590> work<00:03:49.769> for<00:03:50.310> this

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
one won't we know might work for this

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:51.800 
one won't we know might work for this
route<00:03:50.640> but<00:03:51.060> you<00:03:51.120> might<00:03:51.269> play<00:03:51.450> it<00:03:51.540> again<00:03:51.750> and

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
route but you might play it again and

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.270 
route but you might play it again and
try<00:03:52.110> something<00:03:52.319> completely<00:03:52.829> different<00:03:52.860> and

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
try something completely different and

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.800 
try something completely different and
still<00:03:53.489> succeed<00:03:53.700> so<00:03:54.120> it's<00:03:54.239> kind<00:03:54.420> of<00:03:54.480> cool<00:03:54.629> it

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
still succeed so it's kind of cool it

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.240 
still succeed so it's kind of cool it
gets<00:03:54.930> a<00:03:54.989> lot<00:03:55.110> of<00:03:55.170> replayability<00:03:55.560> when<00:03:56.069> you<00:03:56.159> do

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
gets a lot of replayability when you do

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.100 
gets a lot of replayability when you do
that<00:03:56.400> yeah<00:03:56.730> I<00:03:56.940> try<00:03:57.299> to<00:03:57.329> strike<00:03:57.659> a<00:03:57.690> good<00:03:57.870> balance

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
that yeah I try to strike a good balance

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.289 
that yeah I try to strike a good balance
between<00:03:58.470> having<00:03:59.220> a<00:03:59.280> real<00:03:59.459> improvisational
