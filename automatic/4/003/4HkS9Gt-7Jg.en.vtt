background is little too noisy for my

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:10.460 
background is little too noisy for my
test<00:03:05.730> i<00:03:06.000> will<00:03:06.150> just<00:03:06.420> down<00:03:09.230> decrease<00:03:10.230> the

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
test i will just down decrease the

any that it's a very simple 3d software
and<00:04:23.670> I<00:04:24.570> can<00:04:25.530> choose<00:04:26.130> my<00:04:26.910> angle<00:04:27.330> the<00:04:27.810> right<00:04:28.080> the

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
and I can choose my angle the right the

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:30.590 
and I can choose my angle the right the
exact<00:04:28.950> angle<00:04:29.160> the<00:04:29.580> right<00:04:29.790> angle<00:04:30.180> I<00:04:30.270> need<00:04:30.419> which

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
exact angle the right angle I need which

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.730 
exact angle the right angle I need which
is<00:04:30.630> sometimes

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
is sometimes

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.320 
is sometimes
you<00:04:31.800> know<00:04:31.889> if<00:04:32.069> you<00:04:32.190> have<00:04:32.430> to<00:04:32.550> go<00:04:32.729> through<00:04:33.060> a<00:04:33.090> lot

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
you know if you have to go through a lot

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.089 
you know if you have to go through a lot
of<00:04:33.389> photos<00:04:33.930> till<00:04:34.110> you<00:04:34.229> find<00:04:34.500> exactly<00:04:34.740> the

00:04:35.089 --> 00:04:35.099 
of photos till you find exactly the

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:37.879 
of photos till you find exactly the
right<00:04:35.340> angle<00:04:35.759> and<00:04:35.910> exactly<00:04:36.750> the<00:04:36.870> right<00:04:37.139> model

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:37.889 
right angle and exactly the right model

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:40.490 
right angle and exactly the right model
and<00:04:38.250> so<00:04:39.000> the<00:04:39.300> google<00:04:39.630> sketchup<00:04:39.840> really<00:04:40.319> makes

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
and so the google sketchup really makes

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.629 
and so the google sketchup really makes
our<00:04:40.710> job<00:04:41.009> easier<00:04:41.160> in<00:04:41.610> that<00:04:41.789> sense<00:04:42.270> and<00:04:42.710> i<00:04:43.710> can

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 
our job easier in that sense and i can

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:48.710 
our job easier in that sense and i can
turn<00:04:44.970> this<00:04:45.150> around<00:04:46.430> by<00:04:47.430> pressing<00:04:48.000> the<00:04:48.240> middle

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
turn this around by pressing the middle

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.930 
turn this around by pressing the middle
button<00:04:48.990> in<00:04:49.349> the<00:04:49.590> mouse<00:04:49.800> and<00:04:50.479> I<00:04:51.479> can<00:04:51.750> I<00:04:52.789> bring<00:04:53.789> it

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
button in the mouse and I can I bring it

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:57.700 
button in the mouse and I can I bring it
closer<00:04:54.270> or<00:04:54.660> making<00:04:55.380> it<00:04:55.650> go<00:04:56.000> distant<00:04:57.000> by

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
closer or making it go distant by

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:02.210 
closer or making it go distant by
rolling<00:04:58.710> the<00:04:59.009> mouse<00:04:59.940> roller<00:05:00.770> yeah<00:05:01.770> this<00:05:02.069> is<00:05:02.190> a

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
rolling the mouse roller yeah this is a

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.529 
rolling the mouse roller yeah this is a
good<00:05:02.460> version<00:05:02.729> and<00:05:03.240> now<00:05:03.690> i<00:05:03.900> will<00:05:03.960> just<00:05:05.539> export

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:06.539 
good version and now i will just export

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:16.719 
good version and now i will just export
it<00:05:06.750> as<00:05:06.960> a<00:05:07.050> to<00:05:07.620> the<00:05:07.830> graphic
