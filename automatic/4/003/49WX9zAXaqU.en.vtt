00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
see the option eight is network adapter

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.470 
see the option eight is network adapter
thing<00:00:37.530> so<00:00:37.800> I'm<00:00:38.610> going<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:38.910> select<00:00:39.000> option

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
one network adapter and the index number

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.950 
one network adapter and the index number
for<00:00:46.020> network<00:00:46.350> adapter<00:00:46.710> is<00:00:46.829> 11<00:00:47.430> so<00:00:47.940> I'm<00:00:48.780> just

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
for network adapter is 11 so I'm just

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.860 
for network adapter is 11 so I'm just
going<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.200> enter<00:00:49.860> 11<00:00:50.700> and<00:00:50.879> if<00:00:51.329> you<00:00:51.420> see<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.660> IP

select<00:01:03.210> 11<00:01:03.809> that's<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.439> index<00:01:04.650> number<00:01:04.920> for

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
select 11 that's the index number for

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.490 
select 11 that's the index number for
the<00:01:05.280> network<00:01:06.060> adapter<00:01:06.450> for<00:01:06.659> which<00:01:06.930> i<00:01:07.140> want<00:01:07.409> to

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
the network adapter for which i want to

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.539 
the network adapter for which i want to
change<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:08.130> IP<00:01:08.250> address<00:01:08.659> right<00:01:09.659> so<00:01:10.310> now<00:01:11.310> it

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
change the IP address right so now it

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.280 
change the IP address right so now it
gives<00:01:11.760> me<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.000> bunch<00:01:12.210> of<00:01:12.330> option<00:01:12.750> option<00:01:13.020> number

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
gives me a bunch of option option number

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.620 
gives me a bunch of option option number

one asset network adapter address which

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.359 
one asset network adapter address which
is<00:01:15.750> basically<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.350> IP<00:01:16.470> address<00:01:16.890> set<00:01:17.070> dns

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369

servers clear dns server settings return
to<00:01:20.520> main<00:01:20.640> menu<00:01:20.850> so<00:01:21.060> i'm<00:01:21.150> going<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.360> select<00:01:21.509> one

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
set a network adapter at or so it's

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.859 
set a network adapter at or so it's
asking<00:01:25.979> its<00:01:26.130> dsgb<00:01:26.790> or<00:01:27.090> static<00:01:27.540> so<00:01:27.659> i'm<00:01:27.720> going

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
asking its dsgb or static so i'm going

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.039 
asking its dsgb or static so i'm going
to<00:01:27.930> select<00:01:28.200> s4<00:01:29.009> static<00:01:29.490> enter<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.540> static<00:01:30.869> IP

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
to select s4 static enter the static IP

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.539 
to select s4 static enter the static IP
address<00:01:31.439> so<00:01:31.560> i'm<00:01:31.619> going<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.829> enter<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.430> IP

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
address so i'm going to enter the IP

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.069 
address so i'm going to enter the IP
address<00:01:32.700> 10<00:01:33.150> dot<00:01:33.360> 0<00:01:33.720> dot<00:01:33.750> 0<00:01:34.229> dot<00:01:34.350> 22<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:36.079> the

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
address 10 dot 0 dot 0 dot 22 and the

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.580 
address 10 dot 0 dot 0 dot 22 and the
subnet<00:01:37.860> mask<00:01:38.100> it's<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:39.030> default<00:01:39.240> for<00:01:39.960> 10<00:01:40.380> dots

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
subnet mask it's the default for 10 dots

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.420 
subnet mask it's the default for 10 dots
Jesus<00:01:40.920> 255<00:01:41.549> 00<00:01:42.030> so<00:01:42.450> if<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:43.259> just<00:01:43.500> leave<00:01:44.220> it

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
Jesus 255 00 so if you just leave it

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.550 
Jesus 255 00 so if you just leave it
blank<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:44.939> hit<00:01:45.180> enter<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:45.780> takes<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.350> same

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
blank and hit enter it takes the same

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.580 
blank and hit enter it takes the same
now<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.520> default<00:01:48.000> gateway<00:01:48.509> will<00:01:48.720> be<00:01:48.840> 10<00:01:49.140> dot<00:01:49.320> 0

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
now the default gateway will be 10 dot 0

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.139 
now the default gateway will be 10 dot 0
0<00:01:50.009> 2<00:01:50.070> 11<00:01:51.200> right<00:01:52.200> so<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.890> IP<00:01:53.040> address<00:01:53.430> subnet

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
0 2 11 right so the IP address subnet

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.730 
0 2 11 right so the IP address subnet

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
to let enter the password now it is

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.789 
to let enter the password now it is
actually<00:04:02.120> asking<00:04:02.720> they<00:04:02.900> want<00:04:03.109> to<00:04:03.199> change<00:04:03.530> the

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799 
actually asking they want to change the

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:06.219 
actually asking they want to change the
computer<00:04:04.189> name<00:04:04.310> before<00:04:04.609> restarting<00:04:05.030> so<00:04:05.389> i'm

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:06.229 
computer name before restarting so i'm

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:07.899 
computer name before restarting so i'm
going<00:04:06.409> to<00:04:06.500> say<00:04:06.919> no<00:04:06.979> because<00:04:07.489> i've<00:04:07.729> already

00:04:07.899 --> 00:04:07.909 
going to say no because i've already

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:09.849 
going to say no because i've already
changed<00:04:08.389> the<00:04:08.449> computer<00:04:08.810> name<00:04:08.930> but<00:04:09.530> if<00:04:09.709> you

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:09.859 
changed the computer name but if you

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:12.399 
changed the computer name but if you
haven't<00:04:10.400> changed<00:04:10.669> the<00:04:11.479> computer<00:04:11.900> name<00:04:12.049> then

00:04:12.399 --> 00:04:12.409 
haven't changed the computer name then

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:15.369 
haven't changed the computer name then
this<00:04:12.709> good<00:04:13.549> idea<00:04:13.909> because<00:04:14.120> you<00:04:14.389> can<00:04:14.540> avoid<00:04:14.689> to

00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:15.379 
this good idea because you can avoid to

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:17.349 
this good idea because you can avoid to
recharge<00:04:16.009> you<00:04:16.250> know<00:04:16.430> you<00:04:16.729> can<00:04:16.909> avoid<00:04:17.120> one

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
recharge you know you can avoid one

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:18.460 
recharge you know you can avoid one
additional<00:04:17.780> research<00:04:18.109> so<00:04:18.259> i'm<00:04:18.320> going<00:04:18.409> to

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
additional research so i'm going to

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.209 
additional research so i'm going to
select<00:04:18.590> know<00:04:19.359> so<00:04:20.359> you<00:04:21.349> must<00:04:21.590> restart<00:04:21.829> your
