 or the riff-raff today we're going to teach you 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:20.980
 get two mounts in the guru's worth 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:23.349
 one is a raptor worth 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:27.810
 it's like velociraptor shape and the 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:27.810
 another is a black panther 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:33.720
 loose two heads of this most Morra 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.830
 85 heroic mario 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.980
 it's a matter of probabilities to know if 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:40.650
 you are lucky and release it this is 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.490
 get 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:46.700
 we have to go to eastern kingdoms 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:48.430
 in kingdoms of the east we are going to take revenge of 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.860
 13 thorns 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.870
 in vega de espiralce espiral we go to the 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:57.230
 north of vega de tuerce thorn 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:00.199
 and here we have to go to full guru of 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:03.199
 the entrance to the dungeon is here in 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:06.229
 this point here is worth it so nothing is 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:07.970
 issue of going there and entering is worth when 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.190
 let's go tell you that evo are released 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.340
 these two frames 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.410
 so nothing we go there I'm going to go 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.480
 going down because I know you're going to fall 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:20.750
 some time like now as now 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:23.260
 logically I could not miss here at the foot 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.260
 of the wall 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.740
 have to fly under said so you do not 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:34.170
 drop is that sends balls too 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.170
 give thanks to the books 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.950
 love 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.470
 this was a poor order of level 20 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:51.980
 if I feel at the time for example how 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:56.380
 it was called wild savage and I what 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.380
 I feel the serious level 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.750
 we're so sorry you've been excited 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:14.310
 innocents out there calm colleagues 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.310
 busting him 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:23.680
 My baby is squeezing me, stop talking 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.460
 We women are going to put a fucking chat 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:31.590
 and scarce chatting on the phone 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.590
 those people 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.709
 well I change the talents I'm going 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:38.720
 telling people what the two are 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:41.060
 that they will release the saddle 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.250
 well those who release the saddles are the 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.960
 sum high priestess killing ara 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.740
 I agree that this is the one that releases the 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:50.010
 panther 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:52.770
 and the bloody lord commanded that this is 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.500
 the one that releases the raptor is worth these are 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.940
 the two bosses that release so here 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.470
 inside you can simply enter to kill 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.000
 these two bosses if you release us then nothing 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.380
 the next day again because as it is 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.620
 heroic can only be done once 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.620
 daily 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.030
 and we go there 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.620
 to make it clear is that it is 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.620
 used 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.079
 best 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.170
 ok so we're here, this is the 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.720
 time we are interested in Mr. 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.150
 bloody mandoki the one he marked with 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:32.030
 skull 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:32.030
 and nothing then let's get it out 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.430
 well, nothing 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.640
 so we do not have 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:57.730
 let's come not for the clear priestess 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.730
 that is inside the temple this 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:07.860
 OK 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.860
 God 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.040
 Now you get there with your exits 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:16.930
 and I'm lost 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.070
 let your direct die 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.680
 efe 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:31.080
 good 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:34.520
 and the 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.520
 so nothing supports us 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:42.650
 release the motorcycle 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.319
 well, nothing is a matter of coming 

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:52.020
 giving it a little bit every day and some day 

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:53.669
 and someday it will come out 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.900
 and well that 's all for today I hope that 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:05:00.289
