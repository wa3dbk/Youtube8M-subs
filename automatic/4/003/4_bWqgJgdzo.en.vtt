00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:20.119
 and I'm a communist because I created a society 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.970
 communist created a society where 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:27.019
 we have all living in freedom and in 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.019
 equality of conditions 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:30.810
 do not 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.369
 let us remember that our party 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.910
 called first worker party 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.990
 socialist 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:39.390
 that is born in addition to a need 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:42.890
 then workers represent themselves 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.890
 politically by itself 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.520
 is the communist party has always 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.500
 known to interpret movements 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.059
 were the few countries that gave 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.879
 account precisely these yearnings of 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:06.510
 build these popular fronts well 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:06.510
 what countries I can say everything 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:14.109
 I do not understand but I can destroy a 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:18.270
 country was an idea I do not feel that this 

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:18.270
 country got involved in that idea 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.180
 I will not give a blink 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.180
 and I want to fix 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.350
 when he fulfills the mandate that the people 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.350
 give me 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.490
 do not 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.950
 I think here in Chile to stop 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.560
 militant manages to stop it they go to 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.740
 they function as they did they did 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.090
 disappear but they will continue to be 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.990
 Communist militants is party to 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:06.390
 continue to exist and I believe that common 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:09.450
 as an acknowledgment of mine that is what 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.150
 he taught me is what I appreciate because 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.120
 to this day I can be firm 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.250
 despite my family being detained 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:21.860
 I'll be missing sign because 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.860
 that firmness I have for the party 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:30.980
 standing 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.440
 the bar 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.540
 the main work today of us 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.400
 of this generation in not trying to 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.200
 occupy the space of others but that is 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.760
 continue the mission of the others 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.860
 comrades who gave their lives for these 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.849
 dreams to young people we are rebels by 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:49.099
 nature and in general we believe 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:51.349
 that badly channeled rebellion can 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:53.030
 become very badly used and for that 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:55.430
 reason is that we have also proposed 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.410
 transform from this youthful rebellion into 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:01.239
 revolutionary consciousness we are already 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.239
 working hard against neoliberalism 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.780
 and in hope 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:18.379
 I am a communist because through life 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.500
 you form an idea and ideas do not 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:24.360
 they die 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.360
 that's why I'm still a communist
