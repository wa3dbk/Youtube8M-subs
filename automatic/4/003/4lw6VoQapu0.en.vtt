00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
around since my last video that i did

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.330 
around since my last video that i did
with<00:01:35.280> paladin<00:01:35.790> I<00:01:36.509> had<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.619> heads-up<00:01:37.920> display

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
with paladin I had the heads-up display

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.249 
with paladin I had the heads-up display
was<00:01:38.579> above<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.880> focus<00:01:39.360> target<00:01:39.540> but<00:01:39.869> I<00:01:39.900> decided

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
was above the focus target but I decided

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.469 
was above the focus target but I decided
to<00:01:40.470> swap<00:01:40.680> it<00:01:40.860> around<00:01:40.920> so<00:01:41.400> that<00:01:41.430> i<00:01:41.759> could<00:01:42.150> see

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
to swap it around so that i could see

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.800 
to swap it around so that i could see
whenever<00:01:42.720> i<00:01:42.930> had<00:01:43.350> any<00:01:43.710> d<00:01:44.700> buffs<00:01:44.939> on<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.540> target

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
whenever i had any d buffs on the target

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.450 
whenever i had any d buffs on the target
and<00:01:46.079> it<00:01:46.200> was<00:01:46.350> closer<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:47.130> heads-up

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
and it was closer to the heads-up

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.999 
and it was closer to the heads-up
display<00:01:47.909> so<00:01:48.750> that<00:01:48.780> i<00:01:48.899> can<00:01:49.020> see<00:01:49.320> when<00:01:49.770> they<00:01:49.950> fall

directly<00:02:45.780> onto<00:02:45.960> the<00:02:46.200> target<00:02:46.440> so<00:02:46.710> you<00:02:46.800> can<00:02:46.920> see

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
directly onto the target so you can see

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.580 
directly onto the target so you can see
the<00:02:47.160> first<00:02:47.400> thing<00:02:47.580> it<00:02:47.700> did<00:02:47.910> was<00:02:48.110> used<00:02:49.110> barrage

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590

I<00:02:50.100> don't<00:02:50.760> even<00:02:50.850> think<00:02:50.970> it<00:02:51.270> used<00:02:51.480> internal

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
I don't even think it used internal

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.020 
I don't even think it used internal

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
release there I must have that turned

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.860 
release there I must have that turned
off<00:02:54.210> for<00:02:54.510> some<00:02:54.660> reason<00:02:55.050> oh<00:02:55.310> there<00:02:56.310> it<00:02:56.430> is<00:02:56.720> so<00:02:57.720> as

in focus targets and then target of
targets<00:03:31.790> into<00:03:32.790> these<00:03:32.880> macros<00:03:33.300> and<00:03:33.330> I'll<00:03:33.570> show

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
targets into these macros and I'll show

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.660 
targets into these macros and I'll show
you<00:03:33.750> guys<00:03:33.990> how<00:03:34.050> to<00:03:34.260> do<00:03:34.530> that<00:03:34.680> in<00:03:34.890> a<00:03:35.340> separate

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
you guys how to do that in a separate

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.490 
you guys how to do that in a separate
video<00:03:35.880> because<00:03:36.390> it's<00:03:36.570> going<00:03:36.780> to<00:03:36.840> generally

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
video because it's going to generally

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.260 
video because it's going to generally
apply<00:03:37.800> to<00:03:37.860> all<00:03:38.250> of<00:03:38.400> the<00:03:38.520> classes<00:03:38.940> but<00:03:39.120> what

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:39.270 
apply to all of the classes but what

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.920 
apply to all of the classes but what
that<00:03:39.420> will<00:03:39.570> do<00:03:39.720> is<00:03:40.010> it<00:03:41.010> will<00:03:41.040> focus<00:03:41.520> target

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
that will do is it will focus target

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.470 
that will do is it will focus target
whenever<00:03:42.930> I<00:03:43.020> have<00:03:43.440> my<00:03:43.890> tank<00:03:44.370> or<00:03:44.610> another<00:03:44.940> party

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
whenever I have my tank or another party

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.480 
whenever I have my tank or another party
member<00:03:45.780> targeted<00:03:46.290> it<00:03:46.680> will<00:03:46.920> focus<00:03:47.190> target

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.490 
member targeted it will focus target

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:52.610 
member targeted it will focus target
what<00:03:47.850> they<00:03:48.090> are<00:03:48.360> targeting<00:03:48.690> and<00:03:51.350> opposite<00:03:52.350> if

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
what they are targeting and opposite if

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:55.910 
what they are targeting and opposite if
I<00:03:52.950> have<00:03:53.250> the<00:03:53.940> actual<00:03:54.420> striking<00:03:55.230> dummy<00:03:55.530> target

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
I have the actual striking dummy target

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.100 
I have the actual striking dummy target
it<00:03:56.250> will<00:03:56.340> actually<00:03:56.730> just<00:03:57.390> focus<00:03:57.960> target

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:58.110 
it will actually just focus target

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.990 
it will actually just focus target
whatever<00:03:58.590> they<00:03:58.800> are<00:03:58.830> targeting<00:03:59.190> but<00:03:59.880> it's

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
whatever they are targeting but it's

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.490 
whatever they are targeting but it's
really<00:04:00.150> not<00:04:00.360> a<00:04:00.420> big<00:04:00.510> deal<00:04:00.660> because<00:04:01.110> when<00:04:01.470> I

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
really not a big deal because when I

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.100 
really not a big deal because when I
have<00:04:01.740> the<00:04:01.920> striking<00:04:02.330> dummy<00:04:03.330> targeted<00:04:03.780> I<00:04:03.930> can

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
have the striking dummy targeted I can

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.800 
have the striking dummy targeted I can
see<00:04:04.350> what<00:04:04.680> D<00:04:04.890> buffs<00:04:05.160> I<00:04:05.370> have<00:04:05.670> applied<00:04:06.150> to<00:04:06.600> them

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
see what D buffs I have applied to them

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.990 
see what D buffs I have applied to them
just<00:04:07.140> there<00:04:07.410> at<00:04:07.620> the<00:04:07.740> top<00:04:07.950> so<00:04:08.580> it<00:04:08.700> will<00:04:08.790> likely

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
just there at the top so it will likely

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.570 
just there at the top so it will likely
just<00:04:09.360> have<00:04:09.630> the<00:04:09.990> tank<00:04:10.380> as<00:04:10.620> my<00:04:10.980> focus<00:04:11.370> target

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
just have the tank as my focus target

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.000 
just have the tank as my focus target
but<00:04:12.300> that's<00:04:12.570> not<00:04:12.750> necessarily<00:04:12.960> a<00:04:13.530> terrible

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
but that's not necessarily a terrible

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.890 
but that's not necessarily a terrible
thing<00:04:14.220> to<00:04:14.370> have<00:04:14.490> either<00:04:14.700> and<00:04:15.030> that's

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
thing to have either and that's

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.960 
thing to have either and that's
basically<00:04:16.109> it<00:04:16.380> for<00:04:16.500> the<00:04:16.830> straight<00:04:17.280> shot<00:04:17.580> macro
