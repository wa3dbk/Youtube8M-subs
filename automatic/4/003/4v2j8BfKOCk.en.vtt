00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.099

 recommend a tweet to say since it 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:22.310
 call guest mount is a pretty tweet 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.100
 cool that is for payment has in price of 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.990
 $ 0.99 is in big boss 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.580
 and does something as cool as what 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.529
 we have always wished all those 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:31.550
 parents or friends that we have left in 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:33.860
 some time on our device 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.780
 a relative or a friend whatever 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.600
 not because with this tweet we are going to be able to 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.980
 configure a guest mode with which 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.360
 we will be able to restrict certain 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.100
 options this is going to go very well for 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.510
 example those who have children if not 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.700
 you want your children to get in 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.500
 your email on your facebook in 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.180
 boston twitter that you simply want 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.670
 that they play to open the applications 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.020
 at the end of children's not so you're going to 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.270
 be able to control everything with this application 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.739
 but with this tweet in the end we are not going to 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.149
 go the settings to configure it and 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:00.980
 so you will understand a little better 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:02.989
 how it works not good who is 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.980
 here they call westmount so let's go to 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:05.570
 get into it 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.880
 note that from here we can activate it 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.950
 deactivate it and here we have all the 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.320
 options to enter the mode 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.390
 guest not to notice that we can add 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.460
 a button this is a button that is 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.380
 add in the lock screen in the 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.610
 unlock code what are you going to see now 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.469
 a cycle button appears on the left 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.880
 that puts you to be invited we can 

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:24.439
 add one to the right another to the 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.420
 left we can enter making a 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:28.640
 site on the left from the screen 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.049
 lock from the lock screen if 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.939
 we slide to the right too 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:33.590
 unlock and masters without putting the pin but 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:35.119
 we would enter the guest mode that as 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.679
 I told you , restricted, we do not have 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.479
 we can activate a put a gesture of 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:40.640
 Activator I will remove this what we 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.799
 let the ceip let's leave him the 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.240
 button that appears on the left is worth and 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:46.580
 so you can see a little bit what I 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.500
 I mean what you can say is 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.240
 than in the unlock code when 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.700
 put the code that you have put 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.470
 here, you automatically access the 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.229
 guest mode us to leave to remove 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.239
 the little letters I have put four zeros 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.530
 as a password and then here comes the 

00:01:59.239 --> 00:02:02.270
 mother of the lamb because this is where 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.459
 we will be able to configure this tweet to 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.569
 tutiple and we can restrict 

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:07.039
 absolutely everything that he uses in the 

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:09.440
 camera on the lock screen we can 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:11.380
 tell him that in the guest mode enter or 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.370
 do not enter the notification center 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.870
 just as it is we will not enter the 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.310
 center notifications and if in the center 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.930
 of control to fix 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.090
 we can remove multitasking the 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.340
 Siri spotlight we can turn it off 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.180
 practically everything and then the best of 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.280
 all we can select 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.500
 those applications that are going to be able 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.599
 use our friends or kids of the 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.459
 caste who enter guest mode no 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:32.750
 see that we are going to go to some 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.569
 have on the desk for example 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.250
 calendar we have it good at 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:38.810
 final everything that is removed the 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.730
 photos for example everything that is 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.230
 removed will not be able to access and what 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.090
 have the one seen on the right so they're going to 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.190
 to be able to access in such a simple way 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.780
 like this then now let's go to 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.790
 the lock screen to explain 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.709
 a little bit how to enter guest mode 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.880
 not as I said from here we are going to 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.290
 enter guest mode 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.970
 we have a little button that we have put 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.400
 the left when we click here 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.260
 we enter guest mode if we put 40 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.640
 I'm going to put 3 I'm missing one we're going to 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.989
 can also get moving and 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.060
 then we also follow a psoe to the 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:07.099
 left from here I think it was 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.810
 from here we will be able to enter 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:10.549
 according to guest mode also 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.310
 note that the invited monkey does this 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:14.480
 we have all the applications 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.340
 restricted we could not enter nor 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.720
 even the notification center to 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.640
 control center yes because we have 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.019
 configured so we can enter but 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.530
 notice that we can not enter anything 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:23.150
 nothing else 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.400
 applications that we have given 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.050
 photo access for example that here yes 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.600
 that we could enter or that of 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.220
 calendar of agreement and in the end all 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.110
 those applications in principle 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.790
 children if it is for our kids of 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.830
 the house the truth is that this is something 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.930
 that he will have to implement a 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.390
 more powerful parental control or well 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.160
 a system of users because if my ipad 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.020
 For example, I see the whole thing 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.520
 you have only left once in 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.959
 when the kids in the house is 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.940
 interesting that they can not enter 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:52.489
 in the mail so it can be messed up 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.980
 not good to note that to get out of this 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:56.989
 simply that here on the screen 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.209
 lock in the unlock code 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:01.760
 we would put our pin that in this case 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:03.350
 the child is 1234 and we would go into mode 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.239
 normal and from here we can use 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:06.980
 all the functions as you are looking at 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:09.080
 tutiple already according to the center 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.340
 absolutely notifications 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.750
 this is the triptych is the time is it is 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.880
 quite powerful to me I quite like 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.110
 I recommend it and nothing that I say goodbye 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.000
 I hope you liked the video if 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:18.769
 it is like this to support us with a like and we 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.850
 we see in a next video who anac 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.850
