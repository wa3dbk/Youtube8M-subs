would probably want to use this method

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.930 
would probably want to use this method
would<00:02:48.700> be<00:02:48.780> one<00:02:49.780> it's<00:02:49.930> inexpensive<00:02:50.790> too<00:02:51.790> it's

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
would be one it's inexpensive too it's

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.160 
would be one it's inexpensive too it's
to<00:02:52.060> target<00:02:52.450> specific<00:02:53.110> areas<00:02:53.590> in<00:02:54.280> your<00:02:54.670> markets

it also generates easy traffic and the

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:00.780 
it also generates easy traffic and the
response<00:02:59.350> time<00:02:59.560> is<00:02:59.620> usually<00:02:59.890> immediate<00:03:00.550> when

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
response time is usually immediate when

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.170 
response time is usually immediate when
you<00:03:00.940> do<00:03:01.120> it<00:03:01.270> like<00:03:01.390> this<00:03:02.550> you<00:03:03.550> can<00:03:03.580> also<00:03:03.820> do<00:03:04.060> it

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
you do it like this you can also do it

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.580 
you do it like this you can also do it
with<00:03:04.210> business<00:03:04.600> cards<00:03:04.840> if<00:03:04.990> you<00:03:05.140> happen<00:03:05.530> to
