00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:25.369 
need to do with all of our casting is we

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:27.880 
need to do with all of our casting is we
want<00:00:25.550> to<00:00:25.669> control<00:00:26.000> our<00:00:26.060> grip<00:00:26.800> for<00:00:27.800> the

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 
want to control our grip for the

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.939 
want to control our grip for the

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:48.250 
line as it comes off during the casting
process<00:00:44.980> it<00:00:45.980> also<00:00:46.130> has<00:00:46.640> an<00:00:46.910> activation<00:00:47.720> button

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
process it also has an activation button

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
the line to come up so for the purposes

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.880 
the line to come up so for the purposes
of<00:00:55.070> casting<00:00:55.550> this<00:00:55.700> outfit<00:00:56.380> this<00:00:57.380> is<00:00:57.560> the<00:00:57.680> best

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
of casting this outfit this is the best

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:04.240 
of casting this outfit this is the best
grip<00:00:59.290> setup<00:01:01.000> involves<00:01:02.950> disengaging<00:01:03.950> the<00:01:03.980> reel

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
grip setup involves disengaging the reel

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.030 
grip setup involves disengaging the reel
so<00:01:04.549> you're<00:01:04.670> ready<00:01:04.850> to<00:01:05.030> cast<00:01:05.269> and<00:01:06.040> assessing

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
so you're ready to cast and assessing

there's a couple of things that you need
to<00:01:54.009> remember<00:01:54.189> there<00:01:54.520> though<00:01:54.700> if<00:01:55.299> you<00:01:55.509> increase

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:56.170 
to remember there though if you increase

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.229 
to remember there though if you increase
the<00:01:56.409> braking<00:01:56.860> it's<00:01:57.489> going<00:01:57.729> to<00:01:57.789> reduce<00:01:57.970> your

also introduce the potential for tangles

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.490 
also introduce the potential for tangles
for<00:02:08.890> the<00:02:09.009> backlash<00:02:09.360> and<00:02:10.360> a<00:02:10.450> backlash<00:02:10.899> I'm<00:02:11.260> just

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
for the backlash and a backlash I'm just

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.009 
for the backlash and a backlash I'm just
going<00:02:11.680> to<00:02:11.739> demonstrate<00:02:11.860> for<00:02:12.459> you

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:13.019 
going to demonstrate for you

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:16.140

car bring the rod back directly over my
