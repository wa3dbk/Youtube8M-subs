00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 and if we have reached the video number 100 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.319
 of the canal this is thanks to all 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.870
 you corn and that's why we'll see 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:14.240
 all the magic that happens behind the channel 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.240
 they are ready corn yeah 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.309
 what transa mais I had not seen them like that 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.590
 it's more everything started here in this armchair 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:42.260
 old I have in my room the question 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.570
 that you always do is easier 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.370
 because you started making videos in 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.640
 youtube I already explained this in the draw 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:52.250
 my life but I'll explain it again 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.470
 there were doubts one day I just wanted to 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.310
 share what happened to me in music 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.980
 and in the groups where he was there 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.630
 Here I am doing blogs or sinatis 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.000
 guitar tutorials covers 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.890
 gameplays video games if there is only 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.990
 a gameplay but I hope there is more 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.170
 next year and so all those sections 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.940
 will come back in 2014 that's how it is and this is why 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.770
 you have been supporting 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.140
 much to the channel and that's why you're 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.120
 sections will remain in this clear 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.190
 more one another new obviously and as 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.130
 many of you have seen the magic of 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.420
 the blogs is done here in the armchair 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.310
 old so there's not much to say 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.350
 about this place but let's move on 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.650
 all those things and details that make 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.650
 that magath and blogs can exist 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.650
 come with me 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.909
 we follow in the same click the place 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:49.520
 idiot how magic did not happen anything to mateo 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:50.689
 I already realized or how they are more like 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.270
 I would say magazine and this is where 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:55.549
 I usually edit blogs and say 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.770
 normally but he always edited them in 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:00.079
 I leave hipster to the yacht mateo and many of 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.720
 you ask mcafee what 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:04.970
 program you edit your blogs and your videos and 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.460
 the answer is very simple I use the 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.170
 sony vegas pro two programs that can 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.900
 get free on the internet 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.420
 Of course, if you know how to look obviously here 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.560
 it's also where he edited the songs that 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:20.090
 they come out in blogs because obviously the 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.060
 99.9 percent of the songs that 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.610
 they come out in this channel they are mine or that is 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.830
 copyright 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.780
 that you hit it, there really is not much 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.060
 to say about editing a blog like that 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.760
 that we will make a small tour of the room 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.830
 where are the blogs seen this 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.130
 It is the door 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.870
 and those who know me a little 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.840
 audio controller where always 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.090
 I record the books my desk where 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.890
 always recorded and edited everything for those who 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.080
 be guitarists this pedal is very 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.960
 good choice the spoiler blackboard with 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.490
 some megaman and the guitar of 7 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.330
 strings now we will see what is behind 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.330
 of this door 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.060
 but we give light this is a small 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:05.930
 warehouse where I keep all my 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.670
 musical instruments and here you can see 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.349
 some records of my band for lime the 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.660
 first thing I had I still have left over 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:14.670
 enough 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.920
 there's really not much to say about 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.690
 this room is a quarter and already so 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.230
 let's go to the room where the music 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:25.890
 is born there we go more and we are in the 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:30.800
 roof where is the room where 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.800
 they make more blogs and more videos we bring 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.550
 yes 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.680
 so let's take a quick look at what 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.720
 there is in this room, 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:43.730
 amplifier that I always use to record 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.410
 the guitar hero's battery that is the one 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.000
 I always use for the playbacks the 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.670
 air conditioning control that is 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.550
 vital in this room because there is nothing 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.530
 of air some lectern is a fire extinguisher 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.990
 because before there were members of the band 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.540
 They are crazy a little bell that 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:02.269
 still serves 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:05.170
 that there will be mysteries on this door 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:05.170
 will be unveiled now 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.780
 plus 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.400
 this is the first fund I use for the 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:18.620
 Channel already does enough time for 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.359
 curious this fund designed it for a 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.250
 negrete marÃ­n and we are in the second 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:24.470
 place of the house where normally 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.570
 I do the ones that I forgot to put the sack 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.880
 I come back and I have to fix for 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.400
 first time in life for me it's a lot 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.220
 easier to record here since by the 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.600
 properties of the room does not enter or exit 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:39.660
 Absolutely no sound what does 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:41.820
 that this room is also ideal for 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.920
 in case they want to make noise and do not want 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:47.580
 no one listen to them this is the place 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:50.100
 obviously if noise comes in very little but 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.170
 I guess he's right but before 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.090
 continue with this special video that I made 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:56.310
 for you I am going to talk to you a little 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:58.320
 my different personalities I am the 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:01.260
 Mamhazi side of maghazi because let's face it 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:04.080
 we all have a motherly side and in my case 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:07.050
 My mom has got wrapped up in the hipster 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:09.360
 stereotype like this is use some boundaries in 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.490
 8 - bit form reference 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.410
 my fanaticism to the nintendo because the 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:15.270
 Today's games are very mainstream but 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.690
 I also have a mental personality 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:17.690
 was that 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:26.700
 to her knowing him and that they are not 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:29.580
 forget because it is with m of metal with m of 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:33.810
 death with dm of more power with m of 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:35.670
 malidad with m of mcafee and something that does not 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:37.770
 you know about matteo is that with the only 

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:39.030
 Person who is affectionate is with his girlfriend 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.700
 there is no animal 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:44.520
 but good bitches many of you 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:47.700
 have said why do not you open your tweet 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:50.450
 and after a lot of thinking I decided 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.450
 not 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.820
 well I'm almost going to open my twitter 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:57.550
 but I'm going to be writing 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:59.830
 bullshit in the next video les 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:02.290
 I will give my twitter but they are not 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:05.260
 writing pendejadas and that has been for 

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:08.010
 this fucking year we'll see each other until 2014 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:10.780
 the next year is already in a few hours 

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:13.380
 present so it happens that I say goodbye 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:16.320

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:20.580
 I want to speak to you not as mateos or as 

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:22.650
