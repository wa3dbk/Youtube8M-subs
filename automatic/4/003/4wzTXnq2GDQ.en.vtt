00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:10.260
 Founded in 1919 in Monza, Italy 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:14.050
 Carrozzeria Zagato applied aircraft technology 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:20.170
 I was trying to make a lightweight car body 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:23.330
 The second pre-match Alfa Romeo was built on the Zagato body over and over again 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:26.330
 Succeeded in the race 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:31.640
 The collaboration continues even after the war 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:36.829
 Has created some historically attractive models 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:40.010
 The tz that debuted in 1962 can be said to be a representative 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:44.050
 As the name implies that the Zagato in the land volley 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:47.570
 It is a model that adopted the exchange space frame 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:55.040
 The model was built with an aluminum body with excellent aerodynamics 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:57.300
 Julia dohc 1.6 l with maximum power of 110 now on a light body of 660 class 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:01.760
 The unit was mounted 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:05.880
 Based on this, it was further developed to be competitive 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:11.460
 It is tz 2 of 1965 appearance 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:16.890
 Production versus number of also is said with 10 cars both 12 units in addition to it 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:21.740
 There is also an answer in which tz is converted to tz 2, but in any case 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:28.100
 All of which are collar Barry trying to complete the race 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:34.130
 The feature of this tz 2 is about 40 kg lighter by making the body frp 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:36.040
 Further pursue aerodynamics performance by further lowering the nose and the roof 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:41.830
 It is what you are doing 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:43.480
 At the same time engine also N same water as Julia gta in the adoption of the ignition head 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.810
 Highest output 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:54.840
 We have been net up to 165 horsepower 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:54.840
 The maximum speed has dramatically improved from 215 km to 245 km
