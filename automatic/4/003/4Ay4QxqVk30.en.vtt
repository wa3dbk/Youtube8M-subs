00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 Hello everyone today February 22, 2013 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.460
 and in tanks online 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.620
 a new action in honor of the day is already available 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.070
 defender of the fatherland can be purchased 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.740
 tank of any modification with a discount of 25 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.800
 percent of this we will use today 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.060
 to pump hornet tanchik with 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.180
 modifications m0 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.000
 along the m2 modification on this example we 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.119
 also learn to distinguish these modifications 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.640
 from each other this is very useful in order 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:37.160
 to know how cool your opponent is 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:41.370
 or ally and so on the picture you see 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:43.110
 modification of the hornet m0 tank with a gun 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.340
 Smokey m2 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:49.530
 look closely at the tracks on the side 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:52.039
 in the front and in the back 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.879
 they will be the most 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:55.879
 take turns when upgrading 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:07.650
 We looked at the modification M0 remembered and 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:08.729
 we improve that modification m1 here 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.760
 what changed 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:15.049
 remember how it looks now 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:17.880
 modification m1 of the hornet 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:20.100
 front also 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.070
 that here on the case appeared such 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.840
 metal plaque 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:31.890
 once again at the side and the back also added 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:33.470
 some iron in general stanchik tanchik 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.720
 became stronger 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:41.850
 further we pump it before the modification of m2 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:45.000
 press the button to improve confirm 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:48.020
 and what we see armor has become even more 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.929
 armor has become even stronger 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:54.049
 now the tank looks like this with 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:57.810
 one block 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:02:00.479
 another god look what's behind 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:04.250
 virtually everything is plated on 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:09.209
 except for a small square 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:11.989
 metal has become more here and in front 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:16.590
 here too is covered with metal 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:24.180
 that place under the gun in general looks like this 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:29.630
 M2 tank and hornet m2 m2 gun 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.630
