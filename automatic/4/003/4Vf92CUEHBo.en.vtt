possibly an ac130 insert you can do

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.380 
possibly an ac130 insert you can do
above<00:01:47.990> the<00:01:48.170> sky<00:01:48.820> and<00:01:49.820> then<00:01:49.909> the<00:01:50.030> fifth<00:01:50.180> kill

streak is the predator missile and that

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.719 
streak is the predator missile and that

and<00:05:31.440> we<00:05:31.680> also<00:05:31.830> make<00:05:32.100> sure<00:05:32.130> that<00:05:32.250> it's<00:05:32.580> balanced

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
and we also make sure that it's balanced

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.940 
and we also make sure that it's balanced
and<00:05:33.390> there<00:05:33.780> are<00:05:33.900> counters<00:05:34.260> to<00:05:34.500> it<00:05:34.650> in<00:05:34.770> there

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:34.950 
and there are counters to it in there

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:36.740 
and there are counters to it in there
are<00:05:35.040> ways<00:05:35.220> that<00:05:35.250> this<00:05:36.210> isn't<00:05:36.510> the<00:05:36.600> thing

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
are ways that this isn't the thing

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.660 
are ways that this isn't the thing
that's<00:05:36.960> going<00:05:37.110> to<00:05:37.140> break<00:05:37.620> the<00:05:37.800> game<00:05:37.950> so<00:05:38.520> if<00:05:38.580> you

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:38.670 
that's going to break the game so if you

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:39.860 
that's going to break the game so if you
see<00:05:38.790> that<00:05:38.910> guy<00:05:39.060> that's<00:05:39.210> using<00:05:39.540> a<00:05:39.570> tactical

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870 
see that guy that's using a tactical

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.170 
see that guy that's using a tactical
insertion<00:05:40.260> you're<00:05:40.950> actually<00:05:41.160> able<00:05:41.490> to<00:05:41.760> go<00:05:42.060> up

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180 
insertion you're actually able to go up

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:43.760 
insertion you're actually able to go up
and<00:05:42.300> break<00:05:42.480> it<00:05:42.660> and<00:05:42.840> shoot<00:05:43.290> it<00:05:43.410> you<00:05:43.620> can<00:05:43.740> make

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
and break it and shoot it you can make

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:46.010 
and break it and shoot it you can make
it<00:05:44.010> blow<00:05:44.130> up<00:05:44.190> or<00:05:44.850> you<00:05:45.060> can<00:05:45.210> wait<00:05:45.480> behind<00:05:45.690> it

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:46.020 
it blow up or you can wait behind it

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.510 
it blow up or you can wait behind it
which<00:05:46.410> for<00:05:46.590> the<00:05:46.650> guy<00:05:46.740> to<00:05:46.770> spawn<00:05:47.130> and<00:05:47.430> then

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 
which for the guy to spawn and then

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.670 
which for the guy to spawn and then
shoot<00:05:47.670> math<00:05:48.030> and<00:05:49.020> there's<00:05:49.140> all<00:05:49.470> these

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 
shoot math and there's all these

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.620 
shoot math and there's all these
different<00:05:49.920> balances<00:05:50.430> that<00:05:50.700> you<00:05:51.180> see<00:05:51.420> when<00:05:51.540> you

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:51.630 
different balances that you see when you

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.390 
different balances that you see when you
play<00:05:51.900> the<00:05:51.990> game<00:05:52.110> with<00:05:52.320> trap<00:05:52.770> the<00:05:52.920> rice<00:05:53.070> yields

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.400 
play the game with trap the rice yields

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.670 
play the game with trap the rice yields
leader<00:05:53.630> when<00:05:54.630> your<00:05:54.750> next<00:05:54.960> door<00:05:55.140> playing<00:05:55.350> and

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 
leader when your next door playing and

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.530 
leader when your next door playing and
you'll<00:05:55.830> you'll<00:05:56.700> see<00:05:56.880> that<00:05:57.030> you<00:05:57.180> can't<00:05:57.390> shoot

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:57.540 
you'll you'll see that you can't shoot

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.750 
you'll you'll see that you can't shoot
them<00:05:57.750> you<00:05:57.960> have<00:05:58.080> to<00:05:58.110> read<00:05:58.320> chilling<00:05:58.740> out<00:05:58.830> slow

00:05:59.750 --> 00:05:59.760 
them you have to read chilling out slow

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.340 
them you have to read chilling out slow
to<00:05:59.820> swap<00:06:00.120> but<00:06:00.480> block<00:06:01.410> bowls<00:06:01.650> it's<00:06:02.400> really<00:06:02.550> cool

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:03.350 
to swap but block bowls it's really cool

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:05.720 
to swap but block bowls it's really cool
there's<00:06:04.350> a<00:06:04.380> lot<00:06:04.440> of<00:06:04.560> the<00:06:04.680> perks<00:06:04.980> perks<00:06:05.550> can

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:05.730 
there's a lot of the perks perks can

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:07.940 
there's a lot of the perks perks can
upgrade<00:06:05.940> now<00:06:06.240> more<00:06:06.570> use<00:06:06.720> the<00:06:06.900> perks<00:06:07.140> looks

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:07.950 
upgrade now more use the perks looks

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:09.740 
upgrade now more use the perks looks
like<00:06:08.070> the<00:06:08.160> weapons<00:06:08.280> last<00:06:08.610> game<00:06:08.820> they<00:06:09.300> upgrade

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:09.750 
like the weapons last game they upgrade

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:12.920 
like the weapons last game they upgrade
so<00:06:10.440> you<00:06:10.530> can<00:06:10.770> take<00:06:11.010> your<00:06:11.450> hard<00:06:12.450> line<00:06:12.660> which<00:06:12.900> is

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:12.930 
so you can take your hard line which is

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:15.410 
so you can take your hard line which is
get<00:06:13.800> a<00:06:14.040> kill<00:06:14.340> streak<00:06:14.430> for<00:06:14.790> one<00:06:14.880> this<00:06:15.000> code<00:06:15.240> that

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:15.420 
get a kill streak for one this code that

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:17.720 
get a kill streak for one this code that
you're<00:06:15.510> given<00:06:15.690> under<00:06:15.810> sobbing<00:06:16.140> power<00:06:16.350> and<00:06:17.160> you

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:17.730 
you're given under sobbing power and you

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:19.790 
you're given under sobbing power and you
can<00:06:17.880> make<00:06:18.090> your<00:06:18.180> death<00:06:18.420> streaks<00:06:18.720> one<00:06:19.530> months

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:19.800 
can make your death streaks one months

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:24.230 
can make your death streaks one months
so<00:06:21.080> for<00:06:22.080> example<00:06:22.140> the<00:06:22.560> death<00:06:22.740> streak<00:06:22.980> is<00:06:23.850> also

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240 
so for example the death streak is also

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.940 
so for example the death streak is also
a<00:06:24.270> new<00:06:24.360> concept<00:06:24.690> that<00:06:24.990> you<00:06:25.050> choose<00:06:25.410> per<00:06:25.710> class

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:25.950 
a new concept that you choose per class

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:28.910 
a new concept that you choose per class
a<00:06:26.310> copycat<00:06:27.150> is<00:06:27.450> a<00:06:27.510> good<00:06:27.630> example<00:06:27.690> so<00:06:28.650> basically

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:28.920 
a copycat is a good example so basically

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:32.150 
a copycat is a good example so basically
once<00:06:29.610> you've<00:06:29.790> died<00:06:30.030> four<00:06:30.720> times<00:06:30.900> in<00:06:31.020> a<00:06:31.080> row<00:06:31.230> you

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.160 
once you've died four times in a row you

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.830 
once you've died four times in a row you
know<00:06:32.280> you<00:06:32.400> might<00:06:32.550> be<00:06:32.580> the<00:06:32.760> little<00:06:32.940> bones<00:06:33.150> might

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:33.840 
know you might be the little bones might

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.650 
know you might be the little bones might
be<00:06:33.960> able<00:06:34.050> to<00:06:34.200> abet<00:06:34.650> go<00:06:34.890> but<00:06:35.880> you<00:06:36.000> get<00:06:36.360> your<00:06:36.510> copy

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:36.660 
be able to abet go but you get your copy

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:39.260 
be able to abet go but you get your copy
cat<00:06:36.900> and<00:06:37.200> you're<00:06:37.500> able<00:06:37.680> to<00:06:37.740> steal<00:06:37.980> the<00:06:38.270> ethical

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:39.270 
cat and you're able to steal the ethical

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:40.450 
cat and you're able to steal the ethical
just<00:06:39.450> class<00:06:39.630> during<00:06:39.990> a<00:06:40.080> skill

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:40.460 
just class during a skill

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.010 
just class during a skill
you<00:06:40.880> can<00:06:41.000> say<00:06:41.090> this<00:06:41.240> guy<00:06:41.419> just<00:06:41.479> keeps<00:06:41.810> killing

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:42.020 
you can say this guy just keeps killing

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.370 
you can say this guy just keeps killing
me<00:06:42.229> so<00:06:43.009> annoying<00:06:43.400> I'm<00:06:44.180> just<00:06:44.300> still<00:06:44.870> a<00:06:44.900> stop<00:06:45.199> and

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:45.380 
me so annoying I'm just still a stop and

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.689 
me so annoying I'm just still a stop and
get<00:06:45.680> a<00:06:45.740> preview<00:06:45.949> of<00:06:46.160> things<00:06:47.030> a<00:06:47.180> little<00:06:47.300> later

00:06:48.689 --> 00:06:48.699 
get a preview of things a little later

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:51.870 
get a preview of things a little later
so<00:06:49.699> that's<00:06:49.880> that's<00:06:50.210> a<00:06:50.479> little<00:06:50.990> bit<00:06:51.110> of

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:51.880 
so that's that's a little bit of

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:56.260 
so that's that's a little bit of
creative<00:06:52.880> class<00:06:53.740> and<00:06:54.740> you<00:06:54.800> can<00:06:54.949> name<00:06:55.130> them<00:06:55.400> of

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:56.270 
creative class and you can name them of

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:59.650 
creative class and you can name them of
course<00:06:56.650> just
