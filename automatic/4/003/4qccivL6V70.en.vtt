00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
one complaint about ghosts is just the

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.859 
one complaint about ghosts is just the
fact<00:00:29.400> that<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.670> maps<00:00:29.880> are<00:00:30.060> bigger<00:00:30.630> than

like<00:00:33.180> a<00:00:33.210> general<00:00:33.600> scare<00:00:33.840> like<00:00:33.960> on<00:00:34.110> average

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
like a general scare like on average

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.410 
like a general scare like on average
it's<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:35.070> biggest<00:00:35.460> it's<00:00:35.640> ever<00:00:35.700> been<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.329> like

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
it's the biggest it's ever been and like

I<00:00:36.510> like<00:00:36.780> big<00:00:37.020> maps<00:00:37.260> from<00:00:37.380> time<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.680> time

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
I like big maps from time to time

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.590 
I like big maps from time to time
they're<00:00:37.980> definitely<00:00:38.309> fun<00:00:38.520> but<00:00:39.059> I<00:00:39.090> also<00:00:39.329> like

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
they're definitely fun but I also like

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.060 
they're definitely fun but I also like
those<00:00:39.750> super<00:00:40.170> close<00:00:40.379> quarters<00:00:40.710> maps<00:00:40.890> where

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
those super close quarters maps where

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.500 
those super close quarters maps where
you're<00:00:41.190> constantly<00:00:41.610> getting<00:00:41.850> in<00:00:41.969> engagements

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
you're constantly getting in engagements

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.760 
you're constantly getting in engagements
and<00:00:42.629> writing<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:42.989> enemy's<00:00:43.230> face<00:00:43.410> and<00:00:43.620> things

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
and writing the enemy's face and things

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.470 
and writing the enemy's face and things
like<00:00:43.860> that<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.129> I<00:00:44.160> just<00:00:44.309> I<00:00:44.489> don't<00:00:44.610> feel<00:00:45.149> like<00:00:45.329> I

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
like that and I just I don't feel like I

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.880 
like that and I just I don't feel like I
get<00:00:45.719> that<00:00:45.750> enough<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:46.410> ghosts<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.770> that's

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
get that enough and ghosts and that's

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.799 
get that enough and ghosts and that's
probably<00:00:47.129> my<00:00:47.219> biggest<00:00:47.309> play<00:00:47.700> but<00:00:48.030> with<00:00:48.660> this

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
probably my biggest play but with this

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.010 
probably my biggest play but with this
DLC<00:00:49.320> that<00:00:49.559> might<00:00:50.190> be<00:00:50.340> answered<00:00:50.730> so<00:00:51.020> starting

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020

field order you can cause it to erupt

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.140 
field order you can cause it to erupt
and<00:01:19.229> it<00:01:19.619> sends<00:01:19.979> out<00:01:20.070> these<00:01:20.280> shards<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:20.939> like

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
and it sends out these shards of like

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
pretty cool now next up the second map

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.370 
pretty cool now next up the second map
we<00:01:32.490> have<00:01:32.640> is<00:01:32.820> called<00:01:32.970> behemoth<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:33.720> this<00:01:34.170> one

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
we have is called behemoth and this one

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.780 
we have is called behemoth and this one
looks<00:01:34.740> like<00:01:34.829> what<00:01:35.009> are<00:01:35.100> the<00:01:35.159> craziest<00:01:35.520> maps

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
looks like what are the craziest maps

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.249 
looks like what are the craziest maps
we've<00:01:36.000> ever<00:01:36.150> seen<00:01:36.390> called<00:01:36.689> in<00:01:36.810> history<00:01:37.140> so

which<00:01:42.390> is<00:01:42.570> essentially<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.140> giant<00:01:43.500> saw<00:01:43.920> that

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
which is essentially a giant saw that

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.770 
which is essentially a giant saw that
looks<00:01:44.430> like<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:44.759> was<00:01:44.850> spinning<00:01:45.299> around<00:01:45.420> and

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
looks like it was spinning around and

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:46.700 
looks like it was spinning around and
things<00:01:45.930> like<00:01:46.020> that<00:01:46.170> like<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.409> looked

absolutely nuts and they said it's the
long<00:01:48.899> medium<00:01:49.860> sized<00:01:50.189> map<00:01:50.520> so<00:01:50.729> it<00:01:50.820> looks<00:01:50.970> like

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
long medium sized map so it looks like

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.399 
long medium sized map so it looks like
it's<00:01:51.240> super<00:01:51.450> long<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:51.990> looks<00:01:52.049> like<00:01:52.229> it's<00:01:52.320> gonna

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
it's super long it looks like it's gonna

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.899 
it's super long it looks like it's gonna
be<00:01:52.560> pretty<00:01:52.740> good<00:01:52.860> for<00:01:53.009> sniper<00:01:53.280> rifles<00:01:53.700> and

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909

be pretty good for sniper rifles and
they<00:01:54.600> also<00:01:54.750> said<00:01:55.049> this<00:01:55.229> really<00:01:55.530> high<00:01:55.649> up<00:01:55.680> so

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
they also said this really high up so

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.679

you don't want to fall off the sides cuz

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:58.789 
you don't want to fall off the sides cuz
you<00:01:57.750> can<00:01:57.869> fall<00:01:58.049> down<00:01:58.079> to<00:01:58.290> your<00:01:58.380> death<00:01:58.500> kind<00:01:58.740> of

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
you can fall down to your death kind of

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.859 
you can fall down to your death kind of
like<00:01:58.920> you<00:01:59.009> could<00:01:59.189> back<00:01:59.850> in<00:02:00.090> high-rise<00:02:00.630> and

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
like you could back in high-rise and

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.510 
like you could back in high-rise and
things<00:02:01.079> like<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:01.409> so<00:02:01.649> that's<00:02:02.189> pretty<00:02:02.369> cool

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.740 
things like that so that's pretty cool
that's<00:02:02.640> pretty<00:02:02.759> unique<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.329> next<00:02:03.570> step

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
that's pretty unique and the next step

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.719 
that's pretty unique and the next step
for<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.680> kilcher<00:02:05.100> he<00:02:05.189> said<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.460> kill

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
for the the kilcher he said the kill

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:06.770 
for the the kilcher he said the kill
streak<00:02:05.969> when<00:02:06.090> you<00:02:06.149> earned<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.390> kill<00:02:06.540> streak<00:02:06.719> I

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
streak when you earned the kill streak I

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.510 
streak when you earned the kill streak I
think<00:02:07.020> he<00:02:07.110> meant<00:02:07.320> once<00:02:07.590> you<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:08.190> know<00:02:08.220> kind<00:02:08.429> of

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
think he meant once you you know kind of

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.100 
think he meant once you you know kind of
completed<00:02:08.940> your<00:02:09.060> field<00:02:09.300> order<00:02:09.539> you<00:02:09.899> get<00:02:10.050> a

door holding a minigun going around the

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:16.910 
door holding a minigun going around the
map<00:02:15.780> killing<00:02:16.170> people<00:02:16.409> so<00:02:16.500> that<00:02:16.620> sounds

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
map killing people so that sounds

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.410 
map killing people so that sounds
absolutely<00:02:17.250> amazing<00:02:17.790> I<00:02:17.819> can't<00:02:18.060> wait<00:02:18.180> to<00:02:18.269> check

the<00:02:41.760> most<00:02:41.909> part<00:02:42.060> it's<00:02:42.329> gonna<00:02:42.450> be<00:02:42.599> pretty<00:02:42.810> close

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
the most part it's gonna be pretty close

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.179 
the most part it's gonna be pretty close
quarters<00:02:43.290> you<00:02:43.409> to<00:02:43.469> be<00:02:43.560> fighting<00:02:43.889> down<00:02:44.040> in

00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:44.189 
quarters you to be fighting down in

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:45.770 
quarters you to be fighting down in
those<00:02:44.280> tunnels<00:02:44.519> that<00:02:44.760> we<00:02:44.879> saw<00:02:45.060> yesterday<00:02:45.269> and

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
those tunnels that we saw yesterday and

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.390 
those tunnels that we saw yesterday and
in<00:02:45.900> between<00:02:46.260> shipping<00:02:46.829> containers<00:02:47.220> and<00:02:47.340> all

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
in between shipping containers and all

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.470 
in between shipping containers and all
kinds<00:02:47.670> of<00:02:47.730> things<00:02:47.909> so<00:02:48.030> this<00:02:48.120> one<00:02:48.329> sounds

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
kinds of things so this one sounds

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.910 
kinds of things so this one sounds
pretty<00:02:49.049> cool<00:02:49.230> I<00:02:49.290> can't<00:02:49.470> wait<00:02:49.590> to<00:02:49.680> play<00:02:49.739> that

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
enemies by hitting them with it so you

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.640 
enemies by hitting them with it so you
can<00:03:45.239> shoot<00:03:45.479> them<00:03:45.659> and<00:03:45.840> direct<00:03:46.079> impact<00:03:46.470> them

can shoot them and direct impact them

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.979 
can shoot them and direct impact them
but<00:03:47.099> it<00:03:47.220> also<00:03:47.430> creates<00:03:47.970> a<00:03:48.090> timed<00:03:48.359> explosive

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
but it also creates a timed explosive

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:50.899 
but it also creates a timed explosive
that<00:03:49.349> will<00:03:49.500> go<00:03:49.650> off<00:03:49.799> afterwards<00:03:50.459> so<00:03:50.609> to<00:03:50.669> kill

00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:50.909 
that will go off afterwards so to kill

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:52.520 
that will go off afterwards so to kill
people<00:03:51.479> running<00:03:51.870> by<00:03:51.989> and<00:03:52.019> things<00:03:52.349> like<00:03:52.470> that

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
people running by and things like that

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.830 
people running by and things like that
so<00:03:52.739> that<00:03:53.459> sounds<00:03:53.849> absolutely<00:03:54.120> crazy<00:03:54.329> it's<00:03:54.750> a

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
so that sounds absolutely crazy it's a

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.809 
so that sounds absolutely crazy it's a
dome<00:03:55.049> remake<00:03:55.500> as<00:03:55.889> an<00:03:56.069> archaeological<00:03:56.790> site

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819

weapons and multiplayer which sounds

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:03.229 
weapons and multiplayer which sounds
absolutely<00:04:02.189> nuts<00:04:02.459> we've<00:04:02.760> never<00:04:02.970> seen

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239
