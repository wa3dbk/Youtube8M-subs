 What do you think if tomorrow ...

 ... you and I are going to the game room? 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:11.950
 I will pay for the first game. 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.030
 Can you buy double chips, to play on the same team? 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.970
 We are always on the same team. 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.070
 Good afternoon. Our main news ... 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:22.840

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.180
 ... child now an orphan. 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.370
 Last night someone sent a message to the beeper, Sam. 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.030
 The message came from your dad's office in the playroom. 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.660
 You act like I'm going to ... 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.040
 ... find him sitting there working, Alan. 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:01.820
 Where I am? 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.840
 He is diferent. 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.210
 Your father was the Creator. 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.830
 He never thought he would see you again. 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.840
 - Father. - Sam? 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.310

 The net... 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.670
 ... a place of infinite possibilities. 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.900
 Is incredible. 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.610
 More beautiful than I could ever dream ... 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:43.190
 ... and more dangerous ... 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.040
 ... what I could ever imagine. 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:48.960
 What happened? 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.160
 My creation turned against me. 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:53.540
 Kevin Flynn!

 Where are you now? 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.740
 What am I supposed to do? 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.840
 Survive. 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.470
 We have to get you out of here. 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:10.950
 Out there ... 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.580
 ... there is a new world! 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:13.790
 Here they come. 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.150
 Out there ... 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.260
 Yes!
