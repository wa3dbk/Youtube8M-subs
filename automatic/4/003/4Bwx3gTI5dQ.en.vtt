00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 the victim has no tanks, SU-100 is not 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.000
 Latvia is not a single tank as 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:14.240
 it turned out that hundreds of tanks in hundreds 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:17.850
 tanks militants have hundreds of tornadoes 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:22.800
 howitzers do not understand the fact that 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:25.260
 these things can't just get out of nowhere 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.349
 it is clear that they come only from 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.039
 one place there were boundaries actually 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.470
 open 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.880
 take away the members of the council they continue me 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:40.739
 provoke and another 1 of 1 which 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:43.559
 struck something ciev could nobly 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:47.399
 withdraw their troops and lay down their arms 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:50.129
 Roach culture several countries sitting in 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.590
 this room would have been willing to refuse 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.199
 surrender city before offensive 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.899
 armed bandits just refuse 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:03.589
 from your territory and nobly move away 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:07.140
 I think that how much is cynically said about 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:10.350
 noble steps that are not done on 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.080
 Kiev that Kiev missed this 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.680
 opportunity is the territory of Ukraine and 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:22.380
 Ukrainians protect its territory physicist 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:25.110
 you are far away too Minsk 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.140
 you I think that every country itself 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.390
 which they send in this will be known 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.170
 defend your territory to the last 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.060
 blood drops and Kiev exceptions I 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.100
 grateful to the official tour 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.350
 for we come the population sent crucians 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.329
 Federation of sleep would have passed very much 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.240
 Last word to leave Lithuanian 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.840
 colleagues really wanted me really 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.000
 abusing their speeches 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.360
 probably but after that the country said no 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.799
 I can not say two more words 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.720
 surrender your territory yes you 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.250
 get you the whole point of Minsk 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.219
 agreements of all that we 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.520
 we are talking about the reintegration of Ukraine 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:04.439
 integration well, I donâ€™t have how much 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.170
 of great importance where will pass this 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.819
 lines in these conditions last months 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.400
 the problem was that Ukrainian 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.760
 security forces fired on the city so they 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.019
 from 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.510
 Julia Donetsk so they could not 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:18.360
 shoot g shelling the city well 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.280
 what to arrange here this carnage in this 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.120
 the town if anyway it's about 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.680
 reintegration 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.659
 Ukrainian territory what are you going 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.280
 there to hold the state border 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:27.599
 well then let's spend 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.489
 state border and then 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:32.239
 take a different look at this question 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.950
 now about 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.090
 weapons and so on and Lithuania 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.400
 I think the only state 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.129
 who honestly frankly officially 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.659
 He said that it is supplying weapons to 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:44.010
 Kiev so there may be something from 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:47.209
 Lithuanian weapons militia falls 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.209
 thank you too 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:54.650
 her statement let's not compare 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.700
 our strength is 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.030
 Lithuanian armed forces 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.680
 we will return the livestock nothing 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.540
 nothing to do with even if we 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.110
 put some weapon on this drop 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:09.360
 in the sea and in general it makes no difference 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.660
 has sprinkling thanks to this blind behind 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.319
 statement made says chairman 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.840
 introduce yourself in Ukraine again 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:18.620
 process please, thank you gentlemen 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:22.610
 with this sorry for jail cast words 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:25.080
 But the fact that the city of other colleagues 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.970
 totally unacceptable from ours 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.390
 leaders met in Minsk they 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:34.950
 made a very clear statement they 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:39.569
 brush supported specific provisions we 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:42.019
 can't agree with that 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:45.989
 interpretation of the Minsk agreements 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:47.790
 which gives the Russian side, I ask 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:50.100
 excuse me but we are not gathered here 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.200
 in order to make a sentence pancake 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.010
 rather, or give some other 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.109
 interpretation 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:59.160
 according to the relationship that would put 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:04:00.120
 said our sleeves thanks thank you 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.579
 Russian Federation 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.680
 we don't interpret anything we take 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:06.959
 Minsk agreements read letter for 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.760
 letter and believe that everyone should 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:11.840
 reading letters for letters these conventions 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.840
 perform thanks
