00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:10.429 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:13.940 

if<00:00:11.429> you<00:00:11.639> learn<00:00:12.090> how<00:00:12.300> to<00:00:12.330> draw<00:00:12.750> what<00:00:13.170> is<00:00:13.349> really

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
if you learn how to draw what is really

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.269 
if you learn how to draw what is really
there<00:00:14.839> it's<00:00:15.839> quite<00:00:16.199> a<00:00:16.230> different<00:00:16.740> thing<00:00:16.800> from

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
there it's quite a different thing from

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.029 
there it's quite a different thing from
the<00:00:17.970> way<00:00:18.119> most<00:00:18.420> people<00:00:18.570> who<00:00:19.380> don't<00:00:19.650> know<00:00:19.859> how

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
the way most people who don't know how

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.509 
the way most people who don't know how
to<00:00:20.100> draw<00:00:20.400> start<00:00:20.820> out<00:00:20.970> they<00:00:21.180> think<00:00:21.240> a<00:00:21.570> tree<00:00:22.080> a

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:22.519 
to draw start out they think a tree a

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:28.269 
to draw start out they think a tree a
trunk<00:00:23.600> the<00:00:24.600> branches<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:25.439> leaves<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:26.359> the

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279 
trunk the branches the leaves and the

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:30.710 
trunk the branches the leaves and the
theory<00:00:29.279> that<00:00:29.310> they<00:00:29.670> have<00:00:29.910> in<00:00:30.090> their<00:00:30.240> mind<00:00:30.480> the

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
theory that they have in their mind the

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.280 
theory that they have in their mind the
concept<00:00:31.289> is<00:00:32.189> so<00:00:32.430> powerful<00:00:33.059> that<00:00:33.270> it<00:00:33.630> does<00:00:34.110> not

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
concept is so powerful that it does not

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.410 
concept is so powerful that it does not
overcome<00:00:34.980> what's<00:00:35.340> right<00:00:35.700> in<00:00:35.880> front<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:36.239> them

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
overcome what's right in front of them

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.540 
overcome what's right in front of them
and<00:00:36.570> they<00:00:36.690> they<00:00:37.290> can't<00:00:37.680> really<00:00:37.890> see<00:00:38.250> what's

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
and they they can't really see what's

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.760 
and they they can't really see what's
there<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.480> same<00:00:39.750> is<00:00:40.020> true<00:00:40.079> of<00:00:40.379> color

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
there and the same is true of color

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.920 
there and the same is true of color
people<00:00:41.399> in<00:00:41.790> fact<00:00:42.059> who<00:00:42.239> can<00:00:42.390> draw<00:00:42.600> very<00:00:42.840> well

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
people in fact who can draw very well

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.650 
people in fact who can draw very well
will<00:00:43.829> keep<00:00:44.040> reaching<00:00:44.309> for<00:00:44.550> green<00:00:45.030> when<00:00:45.480> they

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
will keep reaching for green when they

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.840 
will keep reaching for green when they
see<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:46.020> bush<00:00:46.379> or<00:00:46.680> blue<00:00:47.010> when<00:00:47.340> they<00:00:47.460> see<00:00:47.520> the

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
see a bush or blue when they see the

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.430 
see a bush or blue when they see the
water<00:00:48.059> or<00:00:48.719> in<00:00:49.320> fact<00:00:49.800> more<00:00:50.129> than<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.520> color<00:00:51.440> one

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
water or in fact more than the color one

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.170 
water or in fact more than the color one
of<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.649> things<00:00:52.890> that<00:00:53.129> happens<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.610> most<00:00:53.940> with

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
of the things that happens to most with

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.660 
of the things that happens to most with
people<00:00:54.570> who<00:00:54.690> paint<00:00:54.989> water<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:55.860> they<00:00:56.160> think<00:00:56.219> if

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
people who paint water is they think if

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.209 
people who paint water is they think if
they<00:00:56.820> put<00:00:56.850> in<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.300> lot<00:00:57.510> of<00:00:57.719> horizontal<00:00:58.170> is<00:00:58.800> it

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
they put in a lot of horizontal is it

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.990 
they put in a lot of horizontal is it
will<00:00:59.370> make<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.699> look<00:00:59.850> like<00:00:59.910> water<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:02.000> even

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
will make it look like water and even

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.020 
will make it look like water and even
when<00:01:03.210> there's<00:01:03.449> very<00:01:03.719> reflective<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:05.030> even

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
when there's very reflective and even

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.980 
when there's very reflective and even
very<00:01:06.240> ripoli<00:01:07.159> water<00:01:08.159> in<00:01:08.520> fact<00:01:08.820> most<00:01:09.720> of<00:01:09.869> the

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
very ripoli water in fact most of the

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.340 
very ripoli water in fact most of the
reflections<00:01:10.560> are<00:01:11.330> vertical<00:01:12.330> elements<00:01:12.960> rather

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
reflections are vertical elements rather

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.649 
reflections are vertical elements rather
than<00:01:13.590> horizontal<00:01:14.220> elements<00:01:14.729> they're<00:01:15.299> sort<00:01:15.570> of

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
than horizontal elements they're sort of

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.730 
than horizontal elements they're sort of
broken<00:01:15.869> up<00:01:16.170> by<00:01:16.409> horizontal<00:01:16.799> things<00:01:18.619> when<00:01:19.619> you

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
broken up by horizontal things when you

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.140 
broken up by horizontal things when you
start<00:01:20.009> going<00:01:20.159> off<00:01:20.460> in<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.640> wrong<00:01:20.880> direction

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
start going off in the wrong direction

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:41.470 
start going off in the wrong direction
it's<00:01:21.780> back<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.439> big<00:01:22.650> brush

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:41.480 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.380 

I<00:01:41.540> think<00:01:42.380> above<00:01:42.740> all<00:01:42.980> what<00:01:43.850> I<00:01:43.880> want<00:01:44.150> my

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
I think above all what I want my

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.860 
I think above all what I want my
painting<00:01:44.690> to<00:01:44.990> be<00:01:45.140> is<00:01:45.290> convincing<00:01:46.510> so<00:01:47.510> it<00:01:47.690> may

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:47.870 
painting to be is convincing so it may

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.170 
painting to be is convincing so it may
not<00:01:47.900> be<00:01:48.140> exact<00:01:48.680> in<00:01:48.890> every<00:01:49.130> detail<00:01:49.370> but<00:01:49.610> I<00:01:49.940> want

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
not be exact in every detail but I want

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.330 
not be exact in every detail but I want
it<00:01:50.270> to<00:01:50.420> convince<00:01:50.900> people<00:01:51.200> that<00:01:51.650> they're

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
it to convince people that they're

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.330 
it to convince people that they're
standing<00:01:52.670> here<00:01:53.150> on<00:01:53.390> the<00:01:54.080> beach<00:01:54.280> looking<00:01:55.280> at

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
standing here on the beach looking at

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.800 
standing here on the beach looking at
the<00:01:55.490> end<00:01:55.760> of<00:01:55.880> the<00:01:56.030> water<00:01:56.210> is<00:01:56.510> wet<00:01:58.540> one<00:01:59.540> time<00:01:59.780> I

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
the end of the water is wet one time I

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.560 
the end of the water is wet one time I
asked<00:02:00.110> my<00:02:00.380> husband<00:02:00.950> what<00:02:01.940> did<00:02:02.150> he<00:02:02.240> think<00:02:02.270> I

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
asked my husband what did he think I

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.420 
asked my husband what did he think I
needed<00:02:02.810> to<00:02:02.930> do<00:02:03.200> to<00:02:03.230> the<00:02:03.530> painting<00:02:04.130> you<00:02:04.160> know

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
needed to do to the painting you know

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.900 
needed to do to the painting you know
how<00:02:05.680> where<00:02:06.680> did<00:02:06.860> it<00:02:06.890> need<00:02:07.160> to<00:02:07.190> go<00:02:07.340> and<00:02:07.550> he<00:02:07.640> said

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
how where did it need to go and he said

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.130 
how where did it need to go and he said
just<00:02:08.240> keep<00:02:08.480> painting<00:02:08.840> until<00:02:09.290> it<00:02:09.440> gets<00:02:09.650> a<00:02:09.800> wet

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
just keep painting until it gets a wet

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:19.400 
just keep painting until it gets a wet
bring<00:02:12.140> out<00:02:12.290> the<00:02:12.470> small<00:02:12.800> guns

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.170 

when<00:02:20.040> I'm<00:02:20.160> trying<00:02:20.400> to<00:02:20.520> draw<00:02:20.820> something

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
when I'm trying to draw something

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.260 
when I'm trying to draw something
accurately<00:02:22.080> in<00:02:22.890> my<00:02:23.190> mind<00:02:23.520> that<00:02:23.850> go<00:02:24.000> back<00:02:24.240> to

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
accurately in my mind that go back to

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.850 
accurately in my mind that go back to
geometry<00:02:25.260> or<00:02:25.530> trigonometry<00:02:26.300> and<00:02:27.300> I<00:02:27.660> or<00:02:28.050> the

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
analytic geometry whatever it was and I

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.460 
analytic geometry whatever it was and I
think<00:02:31.230> about<00:02:31.440> that<00:02:31.650> old<00:02:31.830> XY<00:02:32.460> axis<00:02:33.300> I<00:02:33.570> think

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
think about that old XY axis I think

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.410 
think about that old XY axis I think
about<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:34.950> true<00:02:35.220> vertical<00:02:35.490> and<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.180> true

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
about the true vertical and the true

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.780 
about the true vertical and the true
horizontal<00:02:37.200> it's<00:02:37.740> not<00:02:37.980> hard<00:02:38.280> to<00:02:38.430> find<00:02:38.640> a

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
horizontal it's not hard to find a

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.580 
horizontal it's not hard to find a
horizontal<00:02:39.360> out<00:02:39.480> here<00:02:39.840> we're<00:02:40.020> on<00:02:40.170> the<00:02:40.350> beach

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
horizontal out here we're on the beach

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.040 
horizontal out here we're on the beach
in<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.040> ocean<00:02:41.910> you<00:02:42.060> can<00:02:42.240> assume<00:02:42.630> that<00:02:42.900> is

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
in the ocean you can assume that is

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.820 
in the ocean you can assume that is
perfectly<00:02:43.650> horizontal<00:02:44.690> so<00:02:45.690> in<00:02:45.960> my<00:02:46.170> mind<00:02:46.200> I

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
perfectly horizontal so in my mind I

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.570 
perfectly horizontal so in my mind I
create<00:02:47.280> a<00:02:47.550> vertical<00:02:48.540> that's<00:02:49.580> perpendicular

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
create a vertical that's perpendicular

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.960 
create a vertical that's perpendicular
to<00:02:50.610> that<00:02:51.000> and<00:02:51.830> everything<00:02:52.830> that<00:02:53.070> I<00:02:53.100> draw<00:02:53.520> I

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
to that and everything that I draw I

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.150 
to that and everything that I draw I
think<00:02:54.540> in<00:02:54.660> terms<00:02:54.870> of<00:02:55.110> the<00:02:55.290> length<00:02:55.560> of<00:02:55.890> the

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
think in terms of the length of the

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.740 
think in terms of the length of the
stroke<00:02:56.520> and<00:02:57.320> how<00:02:58.320> many<00:02:58.670> what<00:02:59.670> angle<00:03:00.150> is<00:03:00.300> it<00:03:00.540> off

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
stroke and how many what angle is it off

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.380 
stroke and how many what angle is it off
of<00:03:00.990> horizontal<00:03:01.770> or<00:03:02.010> off<00:03:02.250> of<00:03:02.490> perpendicular

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
of horizontal or off of perpendicular

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.950 
of horizontal or off of perpendicular
and<00:03:03.600> I<00:03:04.500> don't<00:03:04.980> think<00:03:05.310> of<00:03:05.460> it<00:03:05.580> oh<00:03:05.820> this<00:03:06.510> is<00:03:06.720> about

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 
and I don't think of it oh this is about

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.320 
and I don't think of it oh this is about
15<00:03:07.500> degrees<00:03:07.650> and<00:03:08.370> then<00:03:08.520> I<00:03:08.550> think<00:03:08.910> back<00:03:09.120> to

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
15 degrees and then I think back to

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.360 
15 degrees and then I think back to
what's<00:03:09.540> a<00:03:09.690> 30<00:03:09.960> degree<00:03:10.200> triangle<00:03:10.890> look<00:03:11.160> like

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
what's a 30 degree triangle look like

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:12.560 
what's a 30 degree triangle look like
and<00:03:11.610> what's<00:03:11.790> half<00:03:12.000> of<00:03:12.150> that

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
and what's half of that

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.250 
and what's half of that
that's<00:03:13.020> so<00:03:13.380> complex<00:03:14.040> I<00:03:14.370> just<00:03:15.060> look<00:03:15.990> at<00:03:16.140> the

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
that's so complex I just look at the

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.960 
that's so complex I just look at the
angle<00:03:16.650> that's<00:03:16.800> out<00:03:16.980> there<00:03:17.220> and<00:03:17.430> I<00:03:17.520> tried<00:03:17.820> to

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
angle that's out there and I tried to

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.440 
angle that's out there and I tried to
get<00:03:18.120> about<00:03:18.540> the<00:03:18.840> same<00:03:19.110> angle<00:03:19.710> on<00:03:19.980> my<00:03:20.450> canvas

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
get about the same angle on my canvas

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.200 
get about the same angle on my canvas
and<00:03:21.660> about<00:03:22.260> the<00:03:22.440> same<00:03:22.740> length<00:03:23.100> if<00:03:23.730> you<00:03:23.880> get<00:03:24.030> the

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.210 
and about the same length if you get the

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.930 
and about the same length if you get the
length<00:03:24.450> of<00:03:24.660> the<00:03:24.780> stroke<00:03:25.170> and<00:03:25.380> the<00:03:26.040> angle<00:03:26.550> about

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
length of the stroke and the angle about

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.480 
length of the stroke and the angle about
right<00:03:27.920> there<00:03:28.920> you<00:03:29.070> are

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:29.490 
right there you are

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.910 
right there you are
you<00:03:30.120> could<00:03:30.360> create<00:03:30.690> the<00:03:30.990> whole<00:03:31.170> object<00:03:31.740> that

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
you could create the whole object that

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.490 
you could create the whole object that
way<00:03:32.130> so<00:03:32.940> see<00:03:33.180> how<00:03:33.300> this<00:03:33.540> has<00:03:33.720> a<00:03:33.750> lump<00:03:34.170> in<00:03:34.380> the

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
way so see how this has a lump in the

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.010 
way so see how this has a lump in the
middle<00:03:34.530> now<00:03:35.010> I<00:03:35.460> want<00:03:36.090> to<00:03:36.180> make<00:03:36.480> it<00:03:36.660> more<00:03:36.870> of

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.020 
middle now I want to make it more of

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:41.510 
middle now I want to make it more of
just<00:03:37.050> like<00:03:37.530> a<00:03:37.580> continuous<00:03:38.690> slope<00:03:40.100> it's<00:03:41.100> easier

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
just like a continuous slope it's easier

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.790 
just like a continuous slope it's easier
to<00:03:41.670> get<00:03:41.820> the<00:03:42.000> big<00:03:42.240> angle<00:03:43.020> and<00:03:43.260> length<00:03:43.500> from

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
to get the big angle and length from

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.890 
to get the big angle and length from
this<00:03:43.980> to<00:03:44.250> this<00:03:44.460> in<00:03:44.880> the<00:03:45.060> beginning<00:03:45.570> and<00:03:45.690> then

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
this to this in the beginning and then

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.740 
this to this in the beginning and then
make<00:03:46.140> any<00:03:46.380> small<00:03:46.560> adjustments<00:03:47.490> that<00:03:48.330> you<00:03:48.390> want

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
make any small adjustments that you want

00:03:48.750 --> 00:04:08.050 
make any small adjustments that you want
to<00:03:48.959> within<00:03:49.380> that

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.340 

you

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
you

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:13.160
