the ears can move the head can look up
and<00:01:11.310> down<00:01:13.850> way<00:01:14.850> down<00:01:14.880> actually<00:01:16.909> then<00:01:17.909> that<00:01:18.060> can

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
and down way down actually then that can

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.480 
and down way down actually then that can
bend<00:01:18.509> here<00:01:19.549> and<00:01:20.549> rotate<00:01:21.000> here<00:01:21.650> can<00:01:22.650> bend<00:01:22.979> up

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
bend here and rotate here can bend up

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.010 
bend here and rotate here can bend up
and<00:01:23.759> down<00:01:23.939> here<00:01:25.939> you<00:01:26.939> can<00:01:27.150> bend<00:01:27.390> up<00:01:27.600> here

and down here you can bend up here

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.770 
and down here you can bend up here
basically<00:01:28.560> this<00:01:29.250> this<00:01:29.610> up<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.240> here<00:01:30.450> all<00:01:30.630> the

piece this part and this part are the
same<00:01:35.220> this<00:01:35.430> black<00:01:35.670> piece<00:01:35.850> right<00:01:36.030> here<00:01:36.090> at<00:01:36.299> the

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
same this black piece right here at the

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.679 
same this black piece right here at the
very<00:01:36.509> tip<00:01:36.780> detail<00:01:37.110> can<00:01:37.500> rotate<00:01:37.799> here<00:01:38.729> here<00:01:39.509> and

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
very tip detail can rotate here here and

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:40.760 
very tip detail can rotate here here and
here

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
here

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.850

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
and yeah it's just a lot of possibility

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.149 
and yeah it's just a lot of possibility
I<00:01:43.979> really<00:01:44.700> really<00:01:45.240> like<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:46.200> then<00:01:46.470> down

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
I really really like it and then down

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.550 
I really really like it and then down
here<00:01:47.520> on<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.820> legs<00:01:48.060> both<00:01:48.930> sides<00:01:49.200> of<00:01:49.350> the<00:01:49.409> same

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
here on the legs both sides of the same

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.990 
here on the legs both sides of the same
what<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:50.070> can<00:01:50.189> do<00:01:50.280> is<00:01:50.399> you<00:01:50.520> they<00:01:50.670> can<00:01:50.820> rotate

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
what you can do is you they can rotate

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.889 
what you can do is you they can rotate
like<00:01:51.540> this<00:01:52.280> they<00:01:53.280> can<00:01:53.340> bend<00:01:53.729> up<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.180> down<00:01:54.390> here

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
like this they can bend up and down here

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.760 
like this they can bend up and down here
they<00:01:55.740> can<00:01:55.890> rotate<00:01:56.070> like<00:01:56.610> this<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:57.680> then<00:01:58.680> they

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
they can rotate like this and then they

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.149 
they can rotate like this and then they
can<00:01:58.920> move<00:01:59.009> up<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.280> down<00:01:59.399> individually<00:02:01.159> then

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
can move up and down individually then

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.880 
can move up and down individually then
they<00:02:02.310> can<00:02:02.490> go<00:02:02.670> forward<00:02:03.380> actually<00:02:04.380> quite<00:02:04.560> a<00:02:04.680> lot

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
they can go forward actually quite a lot

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.590 
they can go forward actually quite a lot
although<00:02:05.130> that's<00:02:05.399> part<00:02:06.299> of<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.479> new

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
although that's part of the new

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.169 
although that's part of the new
transformation<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:07.590> then<00:02:07.890> you<00:02:08.489> can<00:02:08.670> open<00:02:09.030> and

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
transformation and then you can open and

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.990 
transformation and then you can open and
close<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.539> claws<00:02:09.810> so<00:02:10.560> this<00:02:10.739> thing<00:02:11.009> for<00:02:11.849> as<00:02:11.970> a

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
close the claws so this thing for as a

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.640 
close the claws so this thing for as a
power<00:02:12.270> ranger<00:02:12.480> figure<00:02:12.900> is

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
power ranger figure is

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:17.750 
loaded with articulation and I really
like<00:02:16.799> it's<00:02:17.040> one<00:02:17.220> of<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.370> things<00:02:17.459> that<00:02:17.640> make

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
like it's one of the things that make

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.490 
like it's one of the things that make
this<00:02:17.909> one<00:02:18.120> of<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.269> more<00:02:18.480> impressive<00:02:18.720> Zords

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
this one of the more impressive Zords

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.589 
this one of the more impressive Zords
mom<00:02:20.069> ever<00:02:20.340> I'm<00:02:20.730> sure<00:02:20.909> there's<00:02:21.120> a<00:02:21.209> more

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
mom ever I'm sure there's a more

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.020 
mom ever I'm sure there's a more
impressive<00:02:21.870> ones<00:02:22.260> but<00:02:22.560> this<00:02:23.220> one<00:02:23.280> certainly

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
impressive ones but this one certainly

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.240 
impressive ones but this one certainly
deserves<00:02:24.510> its<00:02:24.720> place<00:02:24.930> in<00:02:25.230> Power<00:02:25.650> Ranger<00:02:26.069> and

this<00:02:29.370> thing<00:02:29.610> unfortunately<00:02:30.329> this<00:02:30.720> is<00:02:30.900> a<00:02:30.930> part

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:31.409 
this thing unfortunately this is a part

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:33.589 
this thing unfortunately this is a part
former<00:02:31.769> when<00:02:32.400> you<00:02:32.489> do<00:02:32.640> is<00:02:32.760> you<00:02:32.879> take<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.329> head

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
former when you do is you take the head

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:37.369 
former when you do is you take the head
off<00:02:34.670> lay<00:02:35.670> it<00:02:35.730> to<00:02:35.819> the<00:02:36.000> side<00:02:36.209> and<00:02:36.540> then<00:02:36.930> you<00:02:37.049> take

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
off lay it to the side and then you take

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:40.690 
off lay it to the side and then you take
the<00:02:38.069> tail<00:02:38.310> off<00:02:38.989> now<00:02:39.989> what's<00:02:40.200> unfortunate

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
the tail off now what's unfortunate

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.220 
the tail off now what's unfortunate
about<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:42.030> parts<00:02:42.269> forming<00:02:42.599> is<00:02:42.750> if<00:02:42.900> you<00:02:42.989> lose

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
about the parts forming is if you lose

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
about the parts forming is if you lose
either<00:02:43.709> of<00:02:43.980> these<00:02:44.189> things<00:02:44.519> the<00:02:45.980> the<00:02:46.980> robot

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
either of these things the the robot

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.860 
either of these things the the robot
mode<00:02:47.430> just<00:02:47.639> if<00:02:47.909> you<00:02:48.030> lose<00:02:48.209> this<00:02:48.480> the<00:02:48.720> robot

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
mode just if you lose this the robot

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.349 
mode just if you lose this the robot
mode<00:02:49.139> still<00:02:49.470> looks<00:02:49.680> fine<00:02:49.920> but<00:02:50.280> it<00:02:50.790> doesn't

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:51.359 
mode still looks fine but it doesn't

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:52.910 
mode still looks fine but it doesn't
look<00:02:51.480> as<00:02:51.599> good<00:02:51.870> as<00:02:51.930> with<00:02:52.079> this<00:02:52.170> if<00:02:52.590> you<00:02:52.739> lose

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
look as good as with this if you lose

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.629 
look as good as with this if you lose
this<00:02:53.220> you<00:02:53.940> don't<00:02:54.180> have<00:02:54.329> the<00:02:54.629> head<00:02:54.750> at<00:02:54.900> all<00:02:55.019> and

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:55.639 
this you don't have the head at all and

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:57.680 
this you don't have the head at all and
also<00:02:56.639> what's<00:02:56.849> unfortunate<00:02:57.090> about<00:02:57.420> the<00:02:57.480> parts

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
also what's unfortunate about the parts

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.819 
also what's unfortunate about the parts
forming<00:02:58.019> is<00:02:58.879> the<00:02:59.879> way<00:03:00.000> this<00:03:00.359> hooks<00:03:00.689> on<00:03:00.900> you

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
forming is the way this hooks on you

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:03.559 
forming is the way this hooks on you
have<00:03:02.040> to<00:03:02.220> wedge<00:03:02.430> it<00:03:02.639> in<00:03:02.790> and<00:03:03.060> sort<00:03:03.269> of<00:03:03.299> bend<00:03:03.510> the

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
have to wedge it in and sort of bend the

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.569 
have to wedge it in and sort of bend the
plastic<00:03:04.019> that<00:03:04.260> could<00:03:04.470> conceivably<00:03:04.859> break<00:03:05.280> and

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579 
plastic that could conceivably break and

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:08.149 
plastic that could conceivably break and
if<00:03:05.670> that<00:03:05.849> ever<00:03:06.060> broke<00:03:06.480> well<00:03:07.470> actually<00:03:07.769> the

00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:08.159 
if that ever broke well actually the

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:11.599 
if that ever broke well actually the
good<00:03:08.280> thing<00:03:08.519> is<00:03:08.730> you<00:03:09.599> could<00:03:09.959> just<00:03:10.379> plug<00:03:11.370> this

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
good thing is you could just plug this

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:13.520 
good thing is you could just plug this
tail<00:03:11.939> bits<00:03:12.239> where<00:03:12.540> it<00:03:12.629> will<00:03:12.780> go<00:03:12.930> for<00:03:13.139> the<00:03:13.200> robot

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
tail bits where it will go for the robot

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.649 
tail bits where it will go for the robot
mode<00:03:13.799> just<00:03:14.459> plug<00:03:14.670> into<00:03:14.849> here<00:03:15.150> and<00:03:15.299> leave<00:03:15.510> it

00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:15.659 
mode just plug into here and leave it

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:19.159 
mode just plug into here and leave it
there<00:03:15.689> maybe<00:03:16.590> even<00:03:16.709> glue<00:03:17.099> it<00:03:17.220> in<00:03:18.169> that

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:19.169 
there maybe even glue it in that

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:21.229 
there maybe even glue it in that
wouldn't<00:03:19.590> that<00:03:20.310> doesn't<00:03:20.549> look<00:03:20.609> optimal<00:03:21.150> in

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
wouldn't that doesn't look optimal in

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:22.670 
wouldn't that doesn't look optimal in
the<00:03:21.269> dragon<00:03:21.660> mill<00:03:21.780> buts<00:03:21.989> wait<00:03:22.199> you<00:03:22.290> can<00:03:22.470> keep

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
the dragon mill buts wait you can keep

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.000 
the dragon mill buts wait you can keep
track<00:03:22.980> of<00:03:23.190> this<00:03:23.280> piece<00:03:23.579> if<00:03:23.790> ever<00:03:24.739> just<00:03:25.739> break

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
track of this piece if ever just break

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.470 
track of this piece if ever just break
so<00:03:26.220> I<00:03:26.250> can't<00:03:26.519> attach<00:03:26.790> back<00:03:27.030> here<00:03:27.209> it's<00:03:27.299> way<00:03:27.419> you

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
so I can't attach back here it's way you

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.039 
so I can't attach back here it's way you
can<00:03:27.660> keep<00:03:27.840> track<00:03:28.109> of<00:03:28.169> it<00:03:28.470> and<00:03:29.419> yeah<00:03:30.419> I<00:03:30.720> just

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
can keep track of it and yeah I just

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.140 
can keep track of it and yeah I just
wanted<00:03:31.349> to<00:03:31.470> mention<00:03:31.620> that<00:03:31.769> so<00:03:32.129> this<00:03:32.940> piece

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
wanted to mention that so this piece

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.559 
wanted to mention that so this piece
goes<00:03:33.389> here<00:03:33.810> and<00:03:33.959> then<00:03:34.709> this<00:03:35.310> piece<00:03:35.609> folds<00:03:36.329> back

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
goes here and then this piece folds back

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.619 
goes here and then this piece folds back
and<00:03:36.930> to<00:03:37.230> the<00:03:37.349> back<00:03:37.560> the<00:03:38.459> legs<00:03:38.699> come<00:03:39.060> forward

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:39.629 
and to the back the legs come forward

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:46.129 
and to the back the legs come forward
straighten<00:03:40.620> out<00:03:43.970> this<00:03:44.970> piece<00:03:45.269> goes<00:03:45.510> under<00:03:45.930> and

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:46.139 
straighten out this piece goes under and

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:50.719 
straighten out this piece goes under and
we<00:03:46.769> can<00:03:46.919> stand<00:03:47.220> him<00:03:47.340> up<00:03:49.069> now<00:03:50.069> let's<00:03:50.370> look<00:03:50.549> at

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:50.729 
we can stand him up now let's look at

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:54.589 
we can stand him up now let's look at
his<00:03:50.909> arms<00:03:52.250> the<00:03:53.250> way<00:03:53.340> the<00:03:53.489> arms<00:03:53.729> work<00:03:53.970> is<00:03:54.239> quite

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
his arms the way the arms work is quite

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:58.729 
his arms the way the arms work is quite
simple<00:03:55.139> and<00:03:55.379> very<00:03:55.680> neat<00:03:56.209> the<00:03:57.209> two<00:03:57.659> legs<00:03:58.440> for

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
simple and very neat the two legs for

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:00.619 
simple and very neat the two legs for
the<00:03:58.859> dragon<00:03:59.280> mode<00:03:59.459> come<00:03:59.790> together<00:03:59.970> on<00:04:00.359> each

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:00.629 
the dragon mode come together on each

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:07.689 
the dragon mode come together on each
end<00:04:02.900> and<00:04:05.000> then<00:04:06.000> the<00:04:06.180> arms<00:04:06.419> rotate<00:04:06.870> down<00:04:07.109> and

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:07.699 
end and then the arms rotate down and

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:13.069 
end and then the arms rotate down and
there<00:04:08.699> you<00:04:08.879> go<00:04:10.609> very<00:04:11.609> very<00:04:12.000> neat<00:04:12.180> I<00:04:12.419> do<00:04:12.479> I<00:04:12.870> like

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
there you go very very neat I do I like

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:16.129 
there you go very very neat I do I like
how<00:04:13.290> the<00:04:13.349> main<00:04:13.620> body<00:04:13.859> transforms<00:04:15.019> even<00:04:16.019> with

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:16.139 
how the main body transforms even with

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:18.229 
how the main body transforms even with
with<00:04:16.470> the<00:04:16.829> parts<00:04:17.099> forming<00:04:17.430> though<00:04:17.609> how<00:04:18.030> much

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
with the parts forming though how much

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:19.729 
with the parts forming though how much
this<00:04:18.449> transforms<00:04:19.109> and<00:04:19.260> how<00:04:19.320> different<00:04:19.560> it

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
this transforms and how different it

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.430 
this transforms and how different it
looks<00:04:19.799> after<00:04:20.070> transforms<00:04:20.729> is<00:04:21.000> very<00:04:21.389> neat<00:04:21.630> so

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
looks after transforms is very neat so

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.690 
looks after transforms is very neat so
the<00:04:22.560> next<00:04:22.710> thing<00:04:22.889> we<00:04:22.979> need<00:04:23.130> to<00:04:23.159> do<00:04:23.310> is<00:04:23.370> we<00:04:23.550> need

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
the next thing we need to do is we need

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.750 
the next thing we need to do is we need
to<00:04:23.760> take<00:04:24.510> the<00:04:24.719> head<00:04:24.870> bit<00:04:25.110> it<00:04:26.099> was<00:04:26.310> like<00:04:26.520> this

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
to take the head bit it was like this

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:27.440 
to take the head bit it was like this
then<00:04:27.090> we<00:04:27.180> pull

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
then we pull

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.440 
then we pull
the<00:04:27.540> head<00:04:27.720> down<00:04:28.020> and<00:04:28.320> opened<00:04:29.010> the<00:04:29.190> mouth<00:04:29.450> what

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.050 
the head down and opened the mouth what
we're<00:04:30.600> going<00:04:30.780> to<00:04:30.900> do<00:04:31.050> is<00:04:31.290> there's<00:04:31.620> a<00:04:31.680> little

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
we're going to do is there's a little

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.710 
we're going to do is there's a little
sea<00:04:33.230> hole<00:04:34.230> right<00:04:34.590> here<00:04:35.060> and<00:04:36.060> what's<00:04:36.480> going<00:04:36.630> to

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
sea hole right here and what's going to

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.080 
sea hole right here and what's going to
happen<00:04:36.810> is<00:04:37.200> this<00:04:37.800> head<00:04:38.160> bits<00:04:38.430> going<00:04:38.640> to<00:04:38.850> slide

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
happen is this head bits going to slide

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.090 
happen is this head bits going to slide
in<00:04:39.330> it's<00:04:39.870> kind<00:04:40.170> of<00:04:40.230> difficult<00:04:40.410> to<00:04:40.710> do<00:04:40.890> because

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
in it's kind of difficult to do because

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.970 
in it's kind of difficult to do because
it<00:04:41.340> likes<00:04:41.520> to<00:04:41.610> pop<00:04:41.850> out<00:04:42.060> but<00:04:42.680> once<00:04:43.680> you<00:04:43.740> get<00:04:43.890> it

reason<00:05:38.970> why<00:05:39.030> this<00:05:39.090> parts<00:05:39.510> important<00:05:40.050> the<00:05:40.890> legs

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:41.160 
reason why this parts important the legs

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.810 
reason why this parts important the legs
can<00:05:41.370> rotate<00:05:41.610> down<00:05:42.210> here<00:05:42.480> 360<00:05:43.340> legs<00:05:44.340> can<00:05:44.550> bend

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:44.820 
can rotate down here 360 legs can bend

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.570 
can rotate down here 360 legs can bend
at<00:05:44.970> the<00:05:45.000> knees<00:05:45.320> about<00:05:46.320> that<00:05:46.590> far<00:05:46.890> and<00:05:47.100> then<00:05:47.430> the

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 
at the knees about that far and then the

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.860 
at the knees about that far and then the
feet<00:05:47.790> can<00:05:48.030> go<00:05:48.150> way<00:05:48.480> back<00:05:48.810> and<00:05:49.140> weight<00:05:49.500> forward

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:50.870 
feet can go way back and weight forward

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.660 
feet can go way back and weight forward
so<00:05:51.870> he<00:05:51.900> is<00:05:52.200> a<00:05:52.230> very<00:05:52.470> very<00:05:52.740> posable<00:05:53.250> power
