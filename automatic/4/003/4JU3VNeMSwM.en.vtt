00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:18.339 
well-loved I think it was like three
years<00:05:16.910> between<00:05:17.120> the<00:05:17.330> person<00:05:17.690> I<00:05:17.960> would<00:05:18.139> like

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:18.349 
years between the person I would like

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:23.890 
years between the person I would like
one<00:05:18.560> per<00:05:18.770> year<00:05:19.010> is<00:05:19.190> that<00:05:19.310> possible<00:05:22.599> no<00:05:23.599> but<00:05:23.810> you

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:23.900 
one per year is that possible no but you

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.960 
one per year is that possible no but you
know<00:05:24.020> I<00:05:24.050> think<00:05:24.260> that's<00:05:24.500> what<00:05:25.160> kind<00:05:25.729> of<00:05:25.820> keeps

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:25.970 
know I think that's what kind of keeps

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:27.640 
know I think that's what kind of keeps
the<00:05:26.090> movie<00:05:26.360> going<00:05:26.570> too<00:05:26.990> is<00:05:27.050> that<00:05:27.260> there's<00:05:27.530> an

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
the movie going too is that there's an

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.370 
the movie going too is that there's an
organic<00:05:27.889> feeling<00:05:28.340> to<00:05:28.760> how<00:05:28.940> it's<00:05:29.150> made

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:30.380 
organic feeling to how it's made

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.140 
organic feeling to how it's made
you<00:05:30.979> know<00:05:31.099> Paul<00:05:31.370> doesn't<00:05:31.580> write<00:05:31.760> the<00:05:31.880> script

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.150 
you know Paul doesn't write the script

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:34.360 
you know Paul doesn't write the script
