00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:16.200
 I arrived at the end of my career with 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.330
 the low point is 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.820
 always remembering a job apart from the 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.700
 front care're working the back ok 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.290
 Keep an eye on this, it's okay. 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:29.220
 you will continue to make the outline 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.180
 here in the length of your 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.090
 scarf 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.420
 It's good to do this, you know. 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.329
 Chain here not to be tight 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:42.450
 having a shower because you go 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.840
 working with the high point is good 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.960
 and look at the junction you can see here 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.080
 point you have a space here saw the 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.390
 Pots you have that point there. 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:57.390
 again you have a space 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.750
 You have the point. See, we are going. 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.330
 work at the point at the junction of the points 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:07.710
 so you will pass your needle here oh 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:10.380
 space junction of the point everything will pass 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:15.000
 here and will make another high point 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:17.429
 hi Mink're seeing again another point 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:31.530

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:32.460
 we have two plus 13 hi + 14 + 15 + one 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.909
 wine 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:40.999

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:44.579
 come here now you will arrest this 

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:50.340
 conjunct is not six points high in 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:56.429
 side junction and is chu junction of 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:02:02.340
 point with a brand new low point of 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:07.459
 other loops are loose leaks 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.640
 point is attached and will do the 

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:12.470

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:35.329
 I know that here will come the low 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:36.530
 junction by law one joint training akita the 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:40.010
