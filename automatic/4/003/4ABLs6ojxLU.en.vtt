 Welcome to yours is you 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.400
 game and has become the new video before 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.710
 a few days ago, the new need for 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.240
 speed i will like all info 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.830
 to summarize that we have so far 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.050
 so that you are up to date with the 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.640
 Things have since the new need for speed 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.200
 still no subtitle and means simple 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.240
 and gripping need for speed 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.190
 it will be published at the end of this year 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.829
 in the fourth quarter of 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.840
 it will be developed from october to december 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.550
 again from games that already for need 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.379
 were responsible for speed wales and 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.690
 they could really get up now 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.730
 The new part is focused because he has one 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.219
 one-year break was taken 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.489
 The new need for speed part will be for pc 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.739
 ps3 and the xbox one appear to me 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.050
 very happy since you finally on the 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.210
 features and the engine of the new 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.129
 consoles and pcs can be worth and 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.989
 no longer downgrade the whole game 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.790
 must and bay to keep because of 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.320
 the old consoles of the new need for 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.120
 speed part is very reminiscent of the 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.160
 He also plays another reason 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.050
 this time at night and it's almost that 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.000
 Most fans will be happy now 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.640
 extensive modification of the cars 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.049
 possible that was in the last 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.939
 do not play the case there was 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.280
 but not so strong and 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.590
 rather boring modification though 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.180
 This time should one really deep clean 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.340
 should go with the modification man 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.590
 can change a lot on the car and 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.360
 that will make the window series very happy 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.619
 Fans of this have the fans 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.049
 developers now in the one-year 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.600
 pause have heard very strongly 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.340
 Feedback belongs to opinions so that one 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.810
 really decided with need 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.680
 for speed really to the roots 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.079
 to return 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.119
 and really based on what the 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.700
 In addition, the series will actually matter 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.799
 an innovative story promised 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.909
 you have defined it innovatively yet 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.189
 do not want to betray 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.329
 but that too should be soon as well 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.549
 It will be a seamless transition 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.380
 passed between multiplayer singleplayer 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.450
 is already at need for speed wales 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.670
 the case was and a core element was what 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.820
 It will be very important in the new part 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.370
 the cold so the really the value of 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.410
 cars what you make for the racer and 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.870
 so on there is also one 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.820
 cooperation between ea and speedhunters 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.750
 a racing community by which one 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.090
 really more details 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.340
 in the cars in the car culture 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.350
 the whole thing is supposed to be a whole new need 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.690
 give a speed experience to the players 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.820
 you really want to say one 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.430
 sometimes emotional connection between the car 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.140
 and abolish it in the race and thereby 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.680
 This cooperation is also very important 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.050
 been 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.270
 the first trailer for the new need for 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.320
 speed part will be on 15 june in the context of 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.060
 e3 a sham 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.980
 I am very curious what we still very much 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.200
 Expect the tiger has me already 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.180
 I like it very much and I think it's very good 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.680
 that we again with the new need for 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.250
 speed part go back to the roots 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.410
 street racing customization night and such 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.480
 so it keeps on remembering very much 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.430
 an underground but I am very happy 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.830
 the graphics are already good so well 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.020
 The tiger was supposedly in the graphic 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.120
 So I'm really looking forward to the e3 and 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.860
 what awaits us there what is yours 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.060
 Opinion on the new need for speed 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.830
 Part of that would interest me very much 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.600
 write me in the comments 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:14.980
 that was so much of me my name is 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.940
 I have to game over and I hope we see 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.940
 us next time
