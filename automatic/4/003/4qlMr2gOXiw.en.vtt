their<00:03:37.780> placement<00:03:38.530> and<00:03:38.710> the<00:03:39.010> fact<00:03:39.250> that

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340 
their placement and the fact that

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.460 
their placement and the fact that

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
the time is dumb why would you put that

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:45.840 
the time is dumb why would you put that
monitor<00:03:44.770> there<00:03:44.950> whether<00:03:45.130> you<00:03:45.310> want<00:03:45.520> to<00:03:45.610> jump

and give it a go yourself it's

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.350 
and give it a go yourself it's
definitely<00:04:29.200> different

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
definitely different

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.940

of<00:04:36.580> Sonic<00:04:36.850> sprites<00:04:37.270> are<00:04:37.690> reminiscent<00:04:38.080> of

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
of Sonic sprites are reminiscent of

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.379 
of Sonic sprites are reminiscent of
other<00:04:38.470> games<00:04:38.740> I<00:04:39.100> believe<00:04:39.310> Sonic<00:04:39.700> CD<00:04:39.970> maybe

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:41.389 
other games I believe Sonic CD maybe

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:43.760 
other games I believe Sonic CD maybe
some<00:04:42.389> other<00:04:42.600> games<00:04:42.900> that<00:04:43.170> the<00:04:43.440> running

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
some other games that the running

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.510 
some other games that the running
animation<00:04:44.300> again<00:04:45.300> I<00:04:45.540> think<00:04:45.750> that<00:04:46.139> CD<00:04:46.530> not<00:04:46.920> 100%

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
animation again I think that CD not 100%

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.690 
animation again I think that CD not 100%
sure<00:04:47.580> because<00:04:48.480> CD<00:04:49.110> is<00:04:49.230> my<00:04:49.440> least<00:04:50.070> played<00:04:50.490> at

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
sure because CD is my least played at

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.480 
sure because CD is my least played at
the<00:04:50.760> favorite<00:04:50.970> classics<00:04:51.720> actually<00:04:52.160> also<00:04:53.160> the

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:53.490 
the favorite classics actually also the

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:55.610 
the favorite classics actually also the
music<00:04:53.910> looping<00:04:54.600> is<00:04:54.720> a<00:04:54.750> bit<00:04:54.990> weird<00:04:55.230> in<00:04:55.500> the

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
music looping is a bit weird in the

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.980 
music looping is a bit weird in the
stage<00:04:55.889> so<00:04:56.550> here<00:04:56.700> we<00:04:56.820> are<00:04:56.850> at<00:04:57.090> the<00:04:57.210> Robotnik<00:04:57.840> was

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.920 
stage so here we are at the Robotnik was
fine<00:04:58.350> you<00:04:58.740> know<00:04:58.860> seems<00:04:59.490> fine<00:05:00.180> enough<00:05:00.450> is<00:05:00.630> first

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
fine you know seems fine enough is first

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:05.360 
fine you know seems fine enough is first
but<00:05:01.380> then<00:05:01.680> what<00:05:02.400> this<00:05:03.169> now<00:05:04.250> ducking<00:05:05.250> in

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
but then what this now ducking in

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.730 
but then what this now ducking in

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
the corner as I originally planned does

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.860 
the corner as I originally planned does

the<00:05:13.050> only<00:05:13.500> way<00:05:13.830> I<00:05:14.190> figured<00:05:14.880> out<00:05:15.030> how<00:05:15.300> to<00:05:15.360> kill

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
the only way I figured out how to kill

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.250 
the only way I figured out how to kill
this<00:05:16.230> boss<00:05:16.530> is<00:05:17.030> when<00:05:18.030> the<00:05:18.300> chain<00:05:18.660> is<00:05:18.690> at<00:05:19.080> its

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
this boss is when the chain is at its

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:24.020 
this boss is when the chain is at its
top<00:05:20.070> height<00:05:20.400> you<00:05:21.270> spin<00:05:21.690> -<00:05:21.900> under<00:05:22.200> ever<00:05:22.550> this<00:05:23.550> is

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.030 
top height you spin - under ever this is

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.350 
top height you spin - under ever this is
very<00:05:24.570> difficult<00:05:24.870> to<00:05:25.200> do<00:05:25.730> because<00:05:26.730> you<00:05:27.000> have<00:05:27.210> to

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
very difficult to do because you have to

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.230 
very difficult to do because you have to
do<00:05:27.540> it<00:05:27.660> with<00:05:27.810> the<00:05:27.930> utmost<00:05:28.169> precision<00:05:29.100> or<00:05:29.970> you

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
do it with the utmost precision or you

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.260 
do it with the utmost precision or you
will<00:05:30.480> get<00:05:31.100> killed<00:05:32.100> like<00:05:32.430> flat-out

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:33.270 
will get killed like flat-out

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.310 
will get killed like flat-out
I<00:05:33.540> barely<00:05:34.500> make<00:05:34.830> it<00:05:34.860> I<00:05:35.600> barely<00:05:36.600> make<00:05:36.930> it<00:05:36.960> alive

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320 
I barely make it I barely make it alive

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.930 
I barely make it I barely make it alive
and<00:05:37.650> it<00:05:38.370> took<00:05:38.610> me<00:05:38.880> a<00:05:38.910> good<00:05:40.070> five<00:05:41.070> tries<00:05:41.460> to<00:05:41.790> get

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 
and it took me a good five tries to get

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.570 
and it took me a good five tries to get
this<00:05:42.090> far<00:05:42.330> probably<00:05:42.960> a<00:05:43.200> lot<00:05:44.100> more<00:05:44.130> than<00:05:44.310> it

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
this far probably a lot more than it

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:50.000 
this far probably a lot more than it
required<00:05:45.000> that's<00:05:45.419> the<00:05:45.570> first<00:05:45.840> level<00:05:49.010> suddenly

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.010 
required that's the first level suddenly

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:51.290 
required that's the first level suddenly
attack<00:05:50.669> of<00:05:50.820> them<00:05:50.940> all

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
attack of them all

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.750 
attack of them all
okay<00:05:51.780> I<00:05:52.020> can<00:05:52.440> love<00:05:52.620> I<00:05:52.830> can<00:05:53.070> live<00:05:53.160> past<00:05:53.400> that<00:05:53.610> I

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:53.760 
okay I can love I can live past that I

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.360 
okay I can love I can live past that I
didn't<00:05:54.150> I<00:05:54.330> didn't<00:05:54.900> actually<00:05:55.080> attack<00:05:55.979> the<00:05:56.010> dude

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
didn't I didn't actually attack the dude

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.440 
didn't I didn't actually attack the dude
so<00:05:57.210> we<00:05:57.510> start<00:05:57.780> again<00:05:57.870> Oh<00:05:58.050> suddenly<00:05:58.470> spikes

00:05:59.440 --> 00:05:59.450 
so we start again Oh suddenly spikes

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:03.510 
so we start again Oh suddenly spikes
because<00:06:00.450> you<00:06:00.720> know<00:06:00.870> that's<00:06:01.020> completely<00:06:01.830> fair

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520 
because you know that's completely fair

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.210 
because you know that's completely fair
all<00:06:04.060> in<00:06:04.389> all<00:06:04.509> I<00:06:04.660> really<00:06:05.050> think<00:06:05.500> that<00:06:05.650> the<00:06:06.009> hack

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:06.220 
all in all I really think that the hack

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:07.980 
all in all I really think that the hack
just<00:06:06.550> needs<00:06:06.789> some<00:06:07.000> work<00:06:07.150> there's<00:06:07.599> a<00:06:07.690> great

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:07.990 
just needs some work there's a great

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:10.110 
just needs some work there's a great
potential<00:06:08.500> there<00:06:08.530> there's<00:06:09.520> some<00:06:09.669> good<00:06:09.849> art

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.120 
potential there there's some good art

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:11.909 
potential there there's some good art
when<00:06:10.479> it<00:06:10.569> comes<00:06:10.780> to<00:06:10.960> the<00:06:11.050> custom<00:06:11.410> boss<00:06:11.620> fights

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:11.919 
when it comes to the custom boss fights

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:16.379 
when it comes to the custom boss fights
and<00:06:13.800> really<00:06:14.800> it<00:06:14.919> just<00:06:14.949> needs<00:06:15.370> improving<00:06:15.909> on

00:06:16.379 --> 00:06:16.389 
and really it just needs improving on

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:18.210 
and really it just needs improving on
the<00:06:16.509> whole<00:06:16.690> level<00:06:17.080> layout<00:06:17.590> and<00:06:17.860> the<00:06:18.190> design

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:18.220 
the whole level layout and the design

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:20.640 
the whole level layout and the design
and<00:06:18.909> the<00:06:18.970> places<00:06:19.539> you've<00:06:19.690> put<00:06:19.960> some<00:06:20.229> enemies

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:20.650 
and the places you've put some enemies

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:24.869 
and the places you've put some enemies
and<00:06:20.979> traps<00:06:21.840> really<00:06:22.840> make<00:06:23.110> it<00:06:23.139> not<00:06:24.129> fun<00:06:24.520> to<00:06:24.669> play

00:06:24.869 --> 00:06:24.879 
and traps really make it not fun to play

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:28.770 
and traps really make it not fun to play
I<00:06:25.210> mean<00:06:25.720> yes<00:06:25.990> fun<00:06:26.289> to<00:06:26.440> play<00:06:26.680> kind<00:06:27.610> of<00:06:27.849> I<00:06:28.150> mean<00:06:28.659> I
