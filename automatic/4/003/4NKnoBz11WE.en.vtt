Eaton from eating Detroit spring to talk
to<00:00:11.070> you<00:00:11.130> about<00:00:11.219> we're<00:00:12.120> using<00:00:12.389> your<00:00:12.660> u-bolts

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
to you about we're using your u-bolts

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.820 
to you about we're using your u-bolts
should<00:00:13.860> I<00:00:14.030> not<00:00:15.030> a<00:00:15.089> good<00:00:15.240> idea<00:00:16.230> now<00:00:16.440> why<00:00:16.619> is<00:00:16.680> that

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
should I not a good idea now why is that

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.880 
should I not a good idea now why is that
well<00:00:17.340> is<00:00:17.520> that<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:18.690> threads<00:00:19.020> and<00:00:19.170> u-bolts<00:00:19.710> are

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
well is that the threads and u-bolts are

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.730 
well is that the threads and u-bolts are
not<00:00:20.189> cut<00:00:20.640> modern<00:00:21.449> u-bolts<00:00:22.020> they're<00:00:22.439> rolled

that<00:00:23.580> is<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.810> shaft<00:00:25.109> of<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.500> u-bolt<00:00:25.949> is

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
that is the shaft of the u-bolt is

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.980 
that is the shaft of the u-bolt is
smaller<00:00:26.640> than<00:00:26.910> what<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.180> actual<00:00:27.330> threat<00:00:27.810> is

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
smaller than what the actual threat is

get<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:47.969> tight<00:00:48.149> again<00:00:48.860> okay<00:00:49.860> Mike<00:00:50.100> so<00:00:50.489> I'm

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
get it tight again okay Mike so I'm

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.310 
get it tight again okay Mike so I'm
going<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.120> be<00:00:51.239> putting<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.539> different<00:00:51.629> axle<00:00:52.199> in

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
going to be putting a different axle in

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.340 
going to be putting a different axle in
my<00:00:52.469> car<00:00:52.879> how<00:00:53.879> do<00:00:53.940> I<00:00:54.059> measure<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.809> u-bolt<00:00:55.230> to

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
my car how do I measure the u-bolt to

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.510 
my car how do I measure the u-bolt to
know<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:55.590> I'm<00:00:55.649> getting<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.920> right<00:00:56.070> u-bolt

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
know that I'm getting the right u-bolt

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.279 
know that I'm getting the right u-bolt
for<00:00:56.730> what<00:00:56.850> I'm<00:00:56.969> doing<00:00:57.270> we<00:00:57.510> need<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.780> know<00:00:57.930> the

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
for what I'm doing we need to know the

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.930 
for what I'm doing we need to know the
diameter<00:00:58.500> thread<00:00:59.480> the<00:01:00.480> length<00:01:00.780> of<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.440> u-bolt

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
diameter thread the length of the u-bolt

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.729 
diameter thread the length of the u-bolt
from<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.090> inside<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.629> U<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.320> end<00:01:04.589> of

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
from the inside of the U to the end of

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.950 
from the inside of the U to the end of
the<00:01:04.799> thread<00:01:05.119> the<00:01:06.119> width<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.570> u-bolt

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
the thread the width of the u-bolt

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.980 
the thread the width of the u-bolt
measured<00:01:07.560> close<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.880> top<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.570> U<00:01:09.750> and

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
measured close to the top of the U and

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.890 
measured close to the top of the U and
of<00:01:10.799> course<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.310> shape<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.970> u-bolt<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.750> can

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
of course the shape of the u-bolt it can

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.359 
of course the shape of the u-bolt it can
be<00:01:13.020> round<00:01:13.320> like<00:01:13.470> this<00:01:13.830> or<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.490> could<00:01:14.700> be<00:01:14.850> square

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
be round like this or it could be square

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:18.440 
be round like this or it could be square
that's<00:01:17.369> basically<00:01:17.790> all<00:01:17.909> we<00:01:18.030> need<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.360> know

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
that's basically all we need to know

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.870 
that's basically all we need to know
that<00:01:18.900> is<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:19.350> so<00:01:19.830> what<00:01:19.920> about<00:01:20.040> torque<00:01:20.400> specs<00:01:20.700> on

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
that is it so what about torque specs on

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.370 
that is it so what about torque specs on
these<00:01:21.090> bolts<00:01:21.360> I<00:01:21.600> mean<00:01:21.750> what<00:01:21.900> do<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.020> want<00:01:22.229> to

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
these bolts I mean what do you want to

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.340 
these bolts I mean what do you want to
do<00:01:22.530> with<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.490> torque<00:01:23.759> arm

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
do with the the torque arm

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.370 
do with the the torque arm
torque<00:01:25.350> on<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.530> 3h<00:01:26.189> u-bolt<00:01:26.670> would<00:01:26.909> be<00:01:27.090> about<00:01:27.540> 30

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
torque on a 3h u-bolt would be about 30

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.450 
torque on a 3h u-bolt would be about 30
pounds<00:01:29.270> torque<00:01:30.270> on<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.770> 7/16<00:01:31.770> u-bolt<00:01:32.189> would<00:01:32.340> be

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
pounds torque on a 7/16 u-bolt would be

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.230 
pounds torque on a 7/16 u-bolt would be
about<00:01:32.640> 45<00:01:33.210> pounds<00:01:33.860> torque<00:01:34.860> on<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.009> 9/16<00:01:35.790> u-bolt

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
about 45 pounds torque on a 9/16 u-bolt

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.450 
about 45 pounds torque on a 9/16 u-bolt
would<00:01:36.540> be<00:01:36.659> about<00:01:36.869> 65<00:01:37.380> pounds<00:01:37.619> it's<00:01:38.070> not<00:01:38.250> really

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
would be about 65 pounds it's not really

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.590 
would be about 65 pounds it's not really
as<00:01:38.549> much<00:01:38.579> as<00:01:38.820> I<00:01:38.909> would<00:01:39.060> have<00:01:39.090> thought<00:01:39.299> so<00:01:39.509> it's

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
as much as I would have thought so it's

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.999 
as much as I would have thought so it's
a<00:01:39.659> good<00:01:39.810> thing<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.079> know<00:01:40.229> that<00:01:40.259> for<00:01:40.650> a<00:01:40.710> guy<00:01:40.829> out

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
a good thing to know that for a guy out

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.289 
a good thing to know that for a guy out
there<00:01:41.040> putting<00:01:41.400> these<00:01:41.490> things<00:01:41.729> together<00:01:41.909> on

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
there putting these things together on

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.210 
there putting these things together on
this<00:01:42.420> car<00:01:42.659> you<00:01:42.930> really<00:01:43.380> don't<00:01:43.560> want<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.770> bear

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
this car you really don't want to bear

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.330 
this car you really don't want to bear
all<00:01:44.399> your<00:01:44.579> muscle<00:01:44.880> down<00:01:45.060> onto<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.570> snug<00:01:45.899> it<00:01:46.020> up

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
all your muscle down onto it snug it up

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.730 
all your muscle down onto it snug it up
oil<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.549> threads<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:48.000> little<00:01:48.270> bit<00:01:48.560> snug<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.710> up
