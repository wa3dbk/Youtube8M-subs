platform in and on the top is letter B
and<00:02:47.420> C<00:02:47.690> that<00:02:47.900> will<00:02:48.049> connect<00:02:48.440> with<00:02:48.620> these<00:02:48.829> holes

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:49.099 
and C that will connect with these holes

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:52.600 
and C that will connect with these holes
okay<00:02:49.970> so<00:02:50.599> starting<00:02:51.140> with<00:02:51.290> letter<00:02:51.470> B<00:02:51.769> and<00:02:52.130> out

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
okay so starting with letter B and out

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.729 
okay so starting with letter B and out
of<00:02:52.760> these<00:02:52.970> two<00:02:53.269> holes<00:02:53.510> they're<00:02:53.870> two<00:02:54.530> holes

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
of these two holes they're two holes

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:56.440 
of these two holes they're two holes
here<00:02:54.829> the<00:02:55.130> larger<00:02:55.579> one<00:02:55.819> will<00:02:56.030> be<00:02:56.150> where<00:02:56.329> the

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
here the larger one will be where the

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.930 
here the larger one will be where the
dowel<00:02:56.660> fits<00:02:57.110> in<00:02:57.379> the<00:02:58.010> smaller<00:02:58.370> one<00:02:58.670> it'll<00:02:58.849> be

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
dowel fits in the smaller one it'll be

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.449 
dowel fits in the smaller one it'll be
where<00:02:59.150> the<00:02:59.269> screw<00:02:59.569> fits<00:02:59.780> in<00:03:00.049> so<00:03:00.950> you're<00:03:01.340> going

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
where the screw fits in so you're going

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.430 
where the screw fits in so you're going
to<00:03:01.489> line<00:03:01.730> up<00:03:01.760> out<00:03:02.120> of<00:03:02.269> these<00:03:02.420> two<00:03:02.720> the<00:03:02.989> larger

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
to line up out of these two the larger

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.009 
to line up out of these two the larger
one<00:03:03.620> is<00:03:03.799> where<00:03:04.010> the<00:03:04.220> dowel<00:03:04.459> goes<00:03:04.760> in<00:03:05.060> its<00:03:05.629> screw

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
one is where the dowel goes in its screw

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:11.500 
one is where the dowel goes in its screw
will<00:03:06.230> go<00:03:06.379> in<00:03:06.560> here<00:03:09.459> like<00:03:10.459> to<00:03:10.640> get<00:03:10.819> it<00:03:10.910> started<00:03:11.420> a

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
will go in here like to get it started a

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.190 
will go in here like to get it started a
little<00:03:11.629> bit<00:03:11.900> so<00:03:12.500> you<00:03:12.590> can<00:03:12.650> line<00:03:12.980> up<00:03:13.250> the<00:03:13.910> hole

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
little bit so you can line up the hole

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.370 
little bit so you can line up the hole
perfect<00:03:16.090> now<00:03:17.090> we're<00:03:17.329> going<00:03:17.480> to<00:03:17.600> do<00:03:17.870> the<00:03:18.049> same

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
they go back to the starting point

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.270 
they go back to the starting point
this<00:03:31.420> was<00:03:31.630> B<00:03:31.840> this<00:03:32.080> is<00:03:32.290> C<00:03:32.320> if<00:03:32.740> this<00:03:32.950> one's<00:03:33.130> gonna

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:13.390 
you notice here that these side pieces

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:17.280 
you notice here that these side pieces
are<00:05:13.840> flush<00:05:14.670> whereas<00:05:15.670> this<00:05:16.420> has<00:05:16.480> like<00:05:17.020> a<00:05:17.080> little

lip<00:05:17.920> here<00:05:18.250> this<00:05:19.180> little<00:05:19.390> foot<00:05:19.840> footing<00:05:20.380> part

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
lip here this little foot footing part

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.570 
lip here this little foot footing part
is<00:05:20.980> the<00:05:21.130> bottom<00:05:21.580> of<00:05:21.790> the<00:05:22.270> bed<00:05:22.680> the<00:05:23.680> flush<00:05:24.040> part

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
is the bottom of the bed the flush part

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.970 
is the bottom of the bed the flush part
is<00:05:24.850> the<00:05:25.060> top<00:05:25.300> so<00:05:26.020> the<00:05:26.170> next<00:05:26.500> step

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:26.980 
is the top so the next step

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.580 
is the top so the next step
is<00:05:27.460> we're<00:05:27.880> going<00:05:28.060> to<00:05:28.270> be<00:05:28.420> taking<00:05:28.900> your<00:05:29.050> luggage

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 
and creating the platform so the letter

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:39.050 
and creating the platform so the letter
H<00:05:34.420> is<00:05:34.840> going<00:05:35.140> to<00:05:35.230> go<00:05:35.350> between<00:05:35.530> the<00:05:35.770> D<00:05:36.160> and<00:05:36.370> E<00:05:37.560> and

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 
H is going to go between the D and E and

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.050 
H is going to go between the D and E and
you're<00:05:40.060> just<00:05:40.270> going<00:05:40.540> to<00:05:40.630> place<00:05:41.730> it<00:05:42.730> in<00:05:42.910> the

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:46.570 
on letter B letter C and let our F okay

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:56.580 
on letter B letter C and let our F okay
great<00:06:47.550> that's<00:06:48.550> all<00:06:48.820> that<00:06:53.250> your<00:06:54.250> bit<00:06:55.230> the<00:06:56.230> front

00:06:59.310 --> 00:06:59.320 
will be the part with the cutout now at

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:02.820 
will be the part with the cutout now at
the<00:06:59.440> final<00:06:59.770> part<00:06:59.980> again<00:07:00.750> the<00:07:01.750> cubes<00:07:02.080> just<00:07:02.380> open

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:02.830 
the final part again the cubes just open

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:08.250 
the final part again the cubes just open
up<00:07:03.480> super<00:07:04.480> easy<00:07:04.750> and<00:07:05.490> you<00:07:06.510> just<00:07:07.510> add<00:07:07.720> the

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:08.260 
up super easy and you just add the

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:12.660 
up super easy and you just add the
rectangles<00:07:08.860> Mississippian<00:07:09.580> side<00:07:11.190> and<00:07:12.190> slide

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:12.670 
rectangles Mississippian side and slide

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:15.480 
rectangles Mississippian side and slide
them<00:07:12.850> in<00:07:13.290> trick<00:07:14.290> is<00:07:14.500> when<00:07:14.710> you<00:07:14.830> put<00:07:15.040> these<00:07:15.190> the

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:15.490 
them in trick is when you put these the

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:17.790 
them in trick is when you put these the
inside<00:07:15.880> pieces<00:07:16.150> keep<00:07:16.780> these<00:07:16.960> little<00:07:17.140> tabs<00:07:17.500> up

00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:17.800 
inside pieces keep these little tabs up

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:22.440 
inside pieces keep these little tabs up
so<00:07:18.160> they're<00:07:18.340> easily<00:07:19.860> move<00:07:20.860> to<00:07:21.400> lift<00:07:22.150> that

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:22.450 
so they're easily move to lift that

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:24.540 
so they're easily move to lift that
middle<00:07:23.230> piece<00:07:23.380> out<00:07:23.620> if<00:07:23.830> you<00:07:23.950> ever<00:07:23.980> want<00:07:24.430> to

middle piece out if you ever want to

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:29.130 
middle piece out if you ever want to
collapse<00:07:25.120> them<00:07:25.510> and<00:07:26.850> these<00:07:27.930> storage<00:07:28.930> bins

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:29.140 
collapse them and these storage bins

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:33.360 
collapse them and these storage bins
here<00:07:29.860> are<00:07:30.070> huge<00:07:30.460> they<00:07:31.030> really<00:07:31.360> hold<00:07:31.510> a<00:07:31.660> lot
