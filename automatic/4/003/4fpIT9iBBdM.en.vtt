00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.929 
editor and there you go you could see
older<00:01:58.290> code<00:01:58.560> exactly<00:01:58.950> how<00:01:59.219> they<00:01:59.369> created<00:01:59.820> it

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
older code exactly how they created it

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.380 
older code exactly how they created it
in<00:02:00.840> terms<00:02:01.200> of<00:02:01.640> you<00:02:02.640> know<00:02:02.759> setting<00:02:03.090> up<00:02:03.240> the

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
in terms of you know setting up the

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.870 
in terms of you know setting up the
layout<00:02:03.540> template<00:02:04.140> so<00:02:04.350> copying<00:02:04.920> CSS<00:02:05.369> files<00:02:05.670> is

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
layout template so copying CSS files is

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.700 
layout template so copying CSS files is
not<00:02:06.030> exactly<00:02:06.420> that<00:02:06.810> all<00:02:07.079> that<00:02:07.290> different<00:02:07.680> from

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
not exactly that all that different from

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.100 
not exactly that all that different from
copying<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:08.340> website<00:02:08.700> it's<00:02:09.390> essentially<00:02:09.989> the

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
copying a website it's essentially the

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.160 
copying a website it's essentially the
same<00:02:10.140> thing

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
same thing

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.860 
same thing
so<00:02:13.190> before<00:02:14.190> you<00:02:14.220> ask<00:02:14.730> a<00:02:14.910> question<00:02:15.060> or<00:02:15.600> if<00:02:15.630> you

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
so before you ask a question or if you

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.110 
so before you ask a question or if you
wonder<00:02:16.170> if<00:02:16.260> it's<00:02:16.380> possible<00:02:16.590> it's<00:02:17.130> very<00:02:17.310> very

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
wonder if it's possible it's very very

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.460 
wonder if it's possible it's very very
very<00:02:18.450> very<00:02:18.600> possible<00:02:19.170> to<00:02:19.530> do<00:02:20.540> so<00:02:21.540> yeah<00:02:21.870> this<00:02:22.290> is

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
very very possible to do so yeah this is

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.410 
very very possible to do so yeah this is
how<00:02:22.620> well<00:02:22.890> you<00:02:22.920> basically<00:02:23.130> copy<00:02:23.640> CSS<00:02:24.150> files

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
how well you basically copy CSS files

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.450

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
always look at the source always looking

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.610 
always look at the source always looking
to<00:02:26.550> have<00:02:26.700> very<00:02:26.910> headed<00:02:27.330> top<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.470> very

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
to have very headed top the very

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.710 
to have very headed top the very
beginning<00:02:29.340> of<00:02:29.460> the<00:02:29.520> page<00:02:29.760> between<00:02:30.510> the

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
beginning of the page between the

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.660 
beginning of the page between the
opening<00:02:31.380> head<00:02:31.560> bracket<00:02:31.980> in<00:02:32.100> the<00:02:32.130> closing<00:02:32.520> head

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
opening head bracket in the closing head

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.750 
opening head bracket in the closing head
bracket<00:02:32.850> and<00:02:33.210> you<00:02:33.960> will<00:02:34.080> find<00:02:34.350> the<00:02:35.010> CSS<00:02:35.490> style

bracket and you will find the CSS style

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.550 
bracket and you will find the CSS style
code<00:02:35.970> that<00:02:36.120> you<00:02:36.180> can<00:02:36.300> just<00:02:36.480> copy<00:02:36.690> apply<00:02:37.260> to<00:02:37.320> the

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
code that you can just copy apply to the

code that you can just copy apply to the
original<00:02:38.010> URL<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:39.210> root<00:02:39.540> address<00:02:39.960> and<00:02:40.250> once

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
original URL the root address and once

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.190 
original URL the root address and once
you<00:02:41.370> open<00:02:41.670> it<00:02:41.760> you<00:02:42.000> can<00:02:42.060> now<00:02:42.300> copy<00:02:42.570> it<00:02:42.810> you<00:02:43.020> can

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
you open it you can now copy it you can

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.780
