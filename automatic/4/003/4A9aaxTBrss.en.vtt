00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.830
 very good to all friends I am black &amp; the 

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.720
 stage and welcome to once again my 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:07.340
 channel and this time is to introduce yourself and 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.840
 give you my opinion of the new call of duty 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.240
 advanced warfare that I'm testing the 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:13.430
 game with germany first of all say og 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.860
 if this video has enough likes and is 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.300
 very commented I will bring you more videos 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.830
 tomorrow because today I will be 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.630
 completely impossible due to the 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.490
 connection but I want to see what game you 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.110
 like not to see that álex in the video 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.699
 I want to see you commenting 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.740
 saying black tomorrow you can talk about 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:30.470
 this the other etc. you leave it to me 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.599
 everything in the video and tomorrow we'll see what 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:34.309
 we make good let's talk about play 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.649
 Blanket, you wind up, what's up with me? 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:37.609
 similar experiences and so on 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:39.649
 to me the truth that he has played has 

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:41.479
 it seemed pretty good the experience to 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:43.010
 I liked it at least but it 

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:44.569
 totally load the essence of call of duty 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.370
 so all of you who are waiting 

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:47.389
 call of duty steel to the idea that 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.249
 this is not a call of duty 

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:51.199
 this is advanced warfare as it is called 

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:53.539
 the game so I'm going to title it myself 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:56.420
 at least because for me as I say no 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:57.889
 has nothing to do with one game with another 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.059
 maps that have seemed to me that this is 

00:00:57.889 --> 00:01:01.010
 One thing that many people are concerned 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.780
 at least then they were one of the 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.120
 things that threw me back the 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.860
 maps are very very balanced 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.940
 due to this change of pace to this 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.770
 Change of game style is for me 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.810
 taste has leveled the maps are medium 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.700
 and even some little ones it seems to me that 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.620
 one is called biolab and that I think is 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.020
 even small to my taste but the truth 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:24.620
 is that very very happy about the 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.120
 weapons at least here in the game with 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.590
 everyone has put their rifles 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.360
 of assault as you are seeing with the 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.460
 half red dot and muffler was what 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.070
 what else did people wear the sniper 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.990
 I have also seen the shotgun and that 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.610
 tell you about submachine guns to me so 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.040
 least I did not like the look 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.110
 I was going a lot but maybe it 's one thing 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.690
 I've noticed I just have not talked about it 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.510
 with other YouTubers were there either 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.610
 be there and he was also willy uncle 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.860
 willy has not gone today has gone vegeta ida 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.270
 vélez or have left and well commented 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.920
 a little bit with them each have had 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.330
 sensations of different to the best 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.670
 it also has to do with accessories 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.720
 because I remember I turned on the tap 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.970
 and people told me but you have 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.650
 put and I do but well I do not know in order 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.360
 I did not break more when the guns this 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.770
 moment I think quite balanced 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.140
 but you're going to see a lot of gameplays like 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.450
 I say assault rifles the gusts of 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.420
 low and could prove as you see 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.250
 to see now in this at least the 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.230
 turret and the titan the quote the truth 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.540
 which is quite difficult to kill but if 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.180
 you do it right it does not have to kill you 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.250
 long distances it is very difficult that the 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.290
 citing you harm why how are you going to see 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.060
 now he looks at me it was going quite 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.280
 otherwise the thing is pretty good 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.260
 I had a fail that you are going to see and it is 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.480
 I think you can not leave the 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.400
 titan is one of the things that have most 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.140
 surprised is it or they charge it or you 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.510
 suicidal as it has happened to me is a 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.099
 fail I've had but I fly with the 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.569
 Titan you can catch flags as you go 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.250
 to see now that that's one thing that very 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:49.069
 few people knew if you can catch 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.780
 flags are valid and I do not know what else to say or 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.040
 people because as I say it is very very little 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.590
 time is three minutes of gameplay 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.150
 due to the limits of activision but 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.640
 as I said before nothing else start the 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.709
 video if you want to know more leave me the 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.349
 comments I want the video 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.640
 be voted because it already works or if yes 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:07.250
 I like that I have this kind of 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.049
 gameplays or preferís other games 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.970
 not so therefore I'm going to 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:13.040
 dismiss I hope you liked this 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.450
 small general glance any doubt 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.400
 leave it to me in the comments in 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.989
 twitter everything description 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.239

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:23.709

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.709
