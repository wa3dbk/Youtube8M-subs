00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
bit more interesting and you'll find

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.680 
bit more interesting and you'll find
you'll<00:00:34.980> get<00:00:35.130> some<00:00:35.340> pretty<00:00:35.579> odd<00:00:35.790> shapes<00:00:36.180> if<00:00:36.480> you

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
you'll get some pretty odd shapes if you

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.530 
you'll get some pretty odd shapes if you
just<00:00:36.950> randomly<00:00:38.690> delete<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:40.579> squares<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:42.270> I

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
just randomly delete the squares and I

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.310 
just randomly delete the squares and I
do<00:00:42.600> mean<00:00:43.020> randomly<00:00:43.680> there<00:00:44.309> is<00:00:44.430> no<00:00:45.289> rhyme<00:00:46.289> or

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
do mean randomly there is no rhyme or

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.040 
do mean randomly there is no rhyme or
reason<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.250> generally<00:00:47.850> take<00:00:48.450> out<00:00:48.690> too

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
reason to it I generally take out too

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.130 
reason to it I generally take out too
because<00:00:49.320> that<00:00:49.710> just<00:00:49.739> in<00:00:50.280> my<00:00:50.579> mind<00:00:51.420> looks<00:00:51.960> a

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
because that just in my mind looks a

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.600 
because that just in my mind looks a
little<00:00:52.289> bit<00:00:52.500> better<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:53.270> then<00:00:54.270> go<00:00:54.539> through<00:00:55.610> go

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
little bit better and then go through go

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.830 
little bit better and then go through go
around<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.600> house<00:00:58.010> with<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.480> outline<00:01:00.480> tool

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
around the house with the outline tool

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:09.020 
around the house with the outline tool
and<00:01:04.040> you<00:01:05.040> will<00:01:05.610> get<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.479> basic<00:01:07.320> outline<00:01:08.030> of

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
and you will get the basic outline of

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.030 
and you will get the basic outline of
the<00:01:09.240> house<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:10.140> depends<00:01:10.590> on<00:01:10.770> what<00:01:10.920> your

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040
