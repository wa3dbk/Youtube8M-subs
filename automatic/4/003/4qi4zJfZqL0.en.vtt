00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:07.560
 Welcome to the first attempt crystal 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:09.240
 to make batteries like over there 2 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.630
 christ i have two crystal batteries 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.730
 poured one from a copper thimble in 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.320
 the middle with an aluminum tube and 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.310
 right in the middle, another one 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.760
 copper pipe in between with mortar 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.189
 poured out 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.930
 up here are the connections and 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.289
 then the second variant consists of 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:31.949
 a normal copper card 22 mm the in 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:35.149
 poured into a tealight lÃ¼becker 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.710
 was between the copper cap and the 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:41.219
 teal it still a rubber ring underneath 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.989
 you glued the distance between 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.899
 the and the electrode is present 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.570
 Now after the mortar has dried 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.530
 we could once the stream the 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.930
 determine the voltage 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.000
 the first thing that strikes me is that 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.890
 aluminum as electrodes not so 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.530
 is suitable because first over here too 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.059
 see that they do that 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.550
 the contact can take out not so 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.439
 good and over here with the battery 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.869
 exactly the same one he knows in the 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.080
 Center the aluminum as soon as the mortar 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.460
 it starts to oxidize and 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.979
 between the electrode and the one is 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.229
 very good contact and between the 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.960
 electrode and copper electro that 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.240
 not such a good contact 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.460
 Aluminum is always - now we have to 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:28.580
 times the currents and tensions these 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.580
 art batteries give so with current 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:38.229
 you can see we catch over here 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.970
 When the copper sleeve is on 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.970
 also a bit loose because the aluminum 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.470
 is oxidized and from the middle to 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.530
 middle area we have here now 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:52.210
 if the short circuit current of 61 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:56.170
 billion and from the middle electrode 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:02:00.729
 outward to have that copper mufin 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:04.470
 we have a current of 0 6 million us 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:07.179
 directly the voltage is DC 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:11.620
 medium connection in the middle we have 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:17.620
 A tension of moment when we turn around 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:20.350
 put 1.2 volts in about that 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.680
 increases outwardly to again and again and 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:26.350
 copper for him a voltage of 12 6 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.530
 volt though the contacts are relatively loose 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.239
 are shown because i tried 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.680
 a led to operate it 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:36.040
 does not work so the voltage 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:38.019
 is 12 volts and although the 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.390
 current in the middle area so six 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:43.299
 to eight millimeters is the lights 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.310
 we do not take the tealight 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:50.500
 battery here comes now only times a 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:54.970
 bit of juice out here the tension of 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:56.859
 outside an electrode that are now 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:04.109
 here 62 millivolt, but I had too 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:03:04.109
 already more moment yes there 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:11.680
 So just a close volt 09 volt 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:14.200
 But you have to call the tele 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:20.430
 mug on press otherwise is not 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:20.430
 contact available just the other 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:32.860
 after they have a tension of yesteryear 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:35.580
 just want it scarce also want here 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.580
 worth the stream 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:46.390
 Here we enter the area 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:56.549
 milliampere sophie / sofie delivers the 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:04:01.209
 not the poor value of 220 billionaire 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:04.200
 at the other hand a value of must 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:04.200
 I'll go from the bottom now 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:12.760
 122 micro ampere so the variant here 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.359
 I would not be with the tealight yet 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.190
 sometimes brown 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:17.919
 an idea was just several of them 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.539
 to arrange on top of each other as a stack and 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:23.949
 a higher voltage only at 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:25.300
 0 5 billion is too little there then 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:28.449
 These copper make variant already 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.710
 better with the next battery the 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:32.760
 is then built rather a 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.360
 plastic container is made with copper aluminum 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.520
 or 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.169
 I will number instead of the aluminum 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.720
 Try other electrodes because that 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:42.639
 aluminum oxidizes when it is with the 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:46.270
 mortar comes together and the oxide layer 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:48.970
 is a good or blockade i have that 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:53.130
 impression good that was the first attempt 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.130
 with crystal batteries
