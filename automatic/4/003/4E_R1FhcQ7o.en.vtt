00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.160 
disable it by pressing the L key as
simple<00:00:35.670> as<00:00:35.760> that<00:00:35.790> we<00:00:36.390> can<00:00:36.540> see<00:00:36.690> as<00:00:36.840> soon<00:00:36.899> as<00:00:37.110> I

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
simple as that we can see as soon as I

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.990 
simple as that we can see as soon as I
activate<00:00:37.620> it<00:00:37.800> I<00:00:37.980> get<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.370> little<00:00:38.610> particle

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
activate it I get a little particle

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.819 
activate it I get a little particle
trail<00:00:39.300> that<00:00:39.629> is<00:00:39.750> pointing<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.440> nearest

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
trail that is pointing to the nearest

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.760 
trail that is pointing to the nearest
source<00:00:41.340> of<00:00:41.640> that<00:00:41.879> or<00:00:42.149> or<00:00:42.930> pocket<00:00:43.379> of<00:00:43.469> that<00:00:43.620> or

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
source of that or or pocket of that or

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.560 
source of that or or pocket of that or
so<00:00:44.219> over<00:00:44.520> there<00:00:44.670> I've<00:00:44.760> got<00:00:44.820> one<00:00:45.090> cold<00:00:45.360> block

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
so over there I've got one cold block

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.389 
so over there I've got one cold block
and<00:00:45.750> it's<00:00:45.960> currently<00:00:46.289> pointing<00:00:46.500> me<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:47.190> that

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
and it's currently pointing me to that

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.850 
and it's currently pointing me to that
and<00:00:47.640> now<00:00:47.789> I'll<00:00:47.910> just<00:00:47.940> change<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.510> iron<00:00:48.690> ore<00:00:48.899> and

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
and now I'll just change to iron ore and

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.799 
and now I'll just change to iron ore and
then<00:00:50.010> I<00:00:50.100> can<00:00:50.250> change<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.640> gold<00:00:50.879> ore<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.270> who

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
then I can change the gold ore and who

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.479 
then I can change the gold ore and who
door<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.230> you<00:00:52.289> can<00:00:52.440> see<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.739> particle<00:00:53.219> trail

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
door and you can see the particle trail

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.369 
door and you can see the particle trail
color<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:54.059> different<00:00:54.480> depending<00:00:54.780> on<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.230> all

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
color is different depending on the all

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.689 
color is different depending on the all
that<00:00:55.559> you're<00:00:55.680> trying<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:55.920> locate<00:00:56.340> which<00:00:56.550> is<00:00:56.670> a

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
that you're trying to locate which is a

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.970 
that you're trying to locate which is a
bit<00:00:56.879> of<00:00:56.940> an<00:00:57.030> nice<00:00:57.480> aesthetic<00:00:58.199> touches<00:00:58.440> opposed

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
bit of an nice aesthetic touches opposed

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.740 
bit of an nice aesthetic touches opposed
but<00:00:59.550> let's<00:00:59.670> just<00:00:59.789> rotate<00:00:59.969> through<00:01:00.329> these<00:01:00.480> you

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
but let's just rotate through these you

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.540 
but let's just rotate through these you
can<00:01:00.870> see<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:00.989> can<00:01:01.170> load<00:01:01.350> locate<00:01:01.949> diamond<00:01:02.370> and

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
can see I can load locate diamond and

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.009 
can see I can load locate diamond and
you<00:01:02.940> can<00:01:03.059> also<00:01:03.210> notice<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:03.719> there's<00:01:03.960> a

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
you can also notice that there's a

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.590 
you can also notice that there's a
little<00:01:04.110> figure<00:01:04.500> underneath<00:01:05.430> which<00:01:06.119> tells<00:01:06.420> you

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
little figure underneath which tells you

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.390 
little figure underneath which tells you
how<00:01:06.630> many<00:01:06.869> blocks<00:01:07.229> away<00:01:07.409> it<00:01:07.590> is<00:01:07.740> so<00:01:08.250> that

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
how many blocks away it is so that

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.429 
how many blocks away it is so that
diamond<00:01:08.729> door<00:01:08.880> is<00:01:09.030> seven<00:01:09.360> blocks<00:01:09.570> away<00:01:09.750> now<00:01:10.380> to

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
diamond door is seven blocks away now to

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.800 
diamond door is seven blocks away now to
actually<00:01:10.770> redisplay<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.850> trail<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.659> can

actually redisplay the trail you can

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.390 
actually redisplay the trail you can
either<00:01:12.960> break<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.290> block<00:01:13.530> or<00:01:13.770> just<00:01:13.830> right-click

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
either break a block or just right-click

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.560 
either break a block or just right-click
on<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.549> block<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:14.939> it<00:01:15.060> will<00:01:15.150> show<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.390> the

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
on a block and it will show you the

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.510 
on a block and it will show you the
trail<00:01:15.810> again<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:16.590> requires<00:01:16.830> like<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.220> block

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
trail again it requires like a block

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.800 
trail again it requires like a block
update<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:18.030> be<00:01:18.119> triggered<00:01:18.390> for<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.720> to

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
update to be triggered for it to

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.170 
update to be triggered for it to
actually<00:01:18.930> show<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.530> particle<00:01:20.009> trail<00:01:20.250> so<00:01:20.820> you

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
actually show the particle trail so you

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.340 
actually show the particle trail so you
could<00:01:21.330> just<00:01:21.450> keep<00:01:21.570> right-clicking<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.229> it

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
could just keep right-clicking and it

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.320 
could just keep right-clicking and it
will<00:01:22.439> show<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.890> exact<00:01:23.159> location<00:01:23.790> of<00:01:23.909> the

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
will show you the exact location of the

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.690 
will show you the exact location of the
nearest<00:01:24.570> or<00:01:25.020> but<00:01:25.890> let's<00:01:26.009> just<00:01:26.159> go<00:01:26.280> background

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
nearest or but let's just go background

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.870 
nearest or but let's just go background
a<00:01:26.820> coal<00:01:27.030> again<00:01:27.409> here<00:01:28.409> we<00:01:28.470> go<00:01:28.619> back<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.220> coal<00:01:29.430> and

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
a coal again here we go back to coal and

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.399 
a coal again here we go back to coal and
by<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.150> way<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.390> does<00:01:30.509> also<00:01:30.840> work<00:01:31.020> on<00:01:31.140> nether

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
by the way it does also work on nether

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.899 
by the way it does also work on nether
ores<00:01:31.619> as<00:01:31.799> well<00:01:31.979> so<00:01:32.189> we've<00:01:32.310> got<00:01:32.430> quartz<00:01:32.729> here

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
ores as well so we've got quartz here

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.969 
ores as well so we've got quartz here
and<00:01:33.119> glowstone<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:33.960> they<00:01:34.079> both<00:01:34.320> work<00:01:34.680> well

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
and glowstone and they both work well

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.190 
and glowstone and they both work well
with<00:01:35.340> this<00:01:35.490> mod<00:01:35.759> but<00:01:36.360> now<00:01:36.600> if<00:01:36.810> we<00:01:36.900> actually<00:01:37.020> a

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
with this mod but now if we actually a

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.600 
with this mod but now if we actually a
right-click<00:01:37.799> you<00:01:37.950> can<00:01:38.009> see<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.280> points<00:01:38.520> of

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
right-click you can see the points of

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.940 
right-click you can see the points of
that<00:01:38.670> coal<00:01:38.909> ore<00:01:39.119> but<00:01:39.810> if<00:01:39.900> I<00:01:39.990> remove<00:01:40.259> this<00:01:40.470> it's

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
that coal ore but if I remove this it's

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.410 
that coal ore but if I remove this it's
now<00:01:41.130> going<00:01:41.310> to<00:01:41.400> point<00:01:41.549> me<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.000> next

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
now going to point me to the next

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.389 
now going to point me to the next
available<00:01:43.079> source<00:01:43.530> of<00:01:43.680> coal<00:01:43.860> which<00:01:44.280> is

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
available source of coal which is

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.800 
available source of coal which is
actually<00:01:44.670> underground<00:01:45.090> so<00:01:45.479> let's<00:01:45.630> follow

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
actually underground so let's follow

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.960 
actually underground so let's follow
this<00:01:46.020> down<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.470> try<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.070> find<00:01:47.189> this<00:01:47.369> coal

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
this down and try and find this coal

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.520 
this down and try and find this coal
that's<00:01:48.210> trying<00:01:48.509> to<00:01:48.570> meet<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.869> point<00:01:49.079> me<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.320> and

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
that's trying to meet to point me to and

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.899 
that's trying to meet to point me to and
here<00:01:49.920> it<00:01:50.009> is<00:01:50.100> you<00:01:50.549> can<00:01:50.700> see<00:01:50.790> it's<00:01:50.880> very

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
here it is you can see it's very

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.850 
here it is you can see it's very
effective<00:01:51.479> it<00:01:51.810> just<00:01:52.020> makes<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.259> direct<00:01:52.439> line<00:01:52.829> of

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
effective it just makes a direct line of

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.920 
effective it just makes a direct line of
particles<00:01:53.520> from<00:01:53.729> you<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.479> nearest<00:01:54.630> source

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
particles from you to the nearest source

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.300 
particles from you to the nearest source
of<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.200> oil<00:01:55.380> you're<00:01:55.500> trying<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:55.799> find<00:01:56.009> and

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
of the oil you're trying to find and

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.490 
of the oil you're trying to find and
down<00:01:56.850> there<00:01:57.090> we've<00:01:57.299> got<00:01:57.329> some<00:01:57.689> coal<00:01:57.899> but<00:01:58.320> next

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
down there we've got some coal but next

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.959 
down there we've got some coal but next
up<00:01:58.680> let's<00:01:58.920> actually<00:01:59.070> test<00:01:59.460> this<00:01:59.549> out<00:01:59.700> with

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
up let's actually test this out with

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.639 
up let's actually test this out with
diamond<00:02:00.420> door<00:02:00.600> so<00:02:00.899> let's<00:02:01.079> just<00:02:01.259> swap<00:02:01.380> around

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
diamond door so let's just swap around

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.440 
diamond door so let's just swap around
to<00:02:01.890> Diamond<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:02.549> then<00:02:02.909> right-click<00:02:03.329> and

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
to Diamond and then right-click and

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.240 
to Diamond and then right-click and
let's<00:02:03.540> see<00:02:03.899> where<00:02:04.079> the<00:02:04.200> nearest<00:02:04.560> source<00:02:04.740> is<00:02:05.009> so

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
let's see where the nearest source is so

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.039 
let's see where the nearest source is so
if<00:02:05.340> we<00:02:05.430> remove<00:02:05.670> this<00:02:05.939> then<00:02:06.479> right-click<00:02:06.899> is

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
if we remove this then right-click is

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.749 
if we remove this then right-click is
pointing<00:02:07.590> me<00:02:07.680> downward<00:02:08.160> so<00:02:08.340> let's<00:02:08.489> just<00:02:08.640> keep

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
pointing me downward so let's just keep

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.369 
pointing me downward so let's just keep
digging<00:02:08.970> down<00:02:09.300> it's<00:02:09.780> actually<00:02:09.929> telling<00:02:10.229> me

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
digging down it's actually telling me

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.960 
digging down it's actually telling me
that<00:02:10.470> it's<00:02:10.560> 50<00:02:10.950> blocks<00:02:11.190> away<00:02:11.400> that's<00:02:11.760> quite<00:02:11.940> a

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
that it's 50 blocks away that's quite a

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.880 
that it's 50 blocks away that's quite a
distance<00:02:12.330> but<00:02:12.870> then<00:02:13.020> again<00:02:13.110> diamond<00:02:13.590> just

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
distance but then again diamond just

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.040 
distance but then again diamond just
born<00:02:14.040> below<00:02:14.400> Y<00:02:14.610> 16<00:02:15.090> so<00:02:15.330> I<00:02:15.540> was<00:02:15.810> kind<00:02:15.990> of

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
born below Y 16 so I was kind of

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.870 
born below Y 16 so I was kind of
expecting<00:02:16.260> it<00:02:16.590> to<00:02:16.710> be<00:02:16.740> quite<00:02:17.010> deep<00:02:17.250> but<00:02:17.520> let's

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
expecting it to be quite deep but let's

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.640 
expecting it to be quite deep but let's
just<00:02:18.000> keep<00:02:18.150> going<00:02:18.209> down<00:02:18.569> and<00:02:18.780> don't<00:02:19.380> worry<00:02:19.560> if

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
just keep going down and don't worry if

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.440 
just keep going down and don't worry if
you<00:02:19.740> can't<00:02:19.980> see<00:02:20.130> I<00:02:20.160> think<00:02:20.340> neither<00:02:20.670> can<00:02:20.910> i<00:02:21.000> it's

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
you can't see I think neither can i it's

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.270 
you can't see I think neither can i it's
pitch<00:02:21.660> black<00:02:21.690> down<00:02:22.050> here<00:02:22.319> all<00:02:22.770> I<00:02:22.920> can<00:02:23.069> see<00:02:23.190> is

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
pitch black down here all I can see is

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.820 
pitch black down here all I can see is
that<00:02:23.430> particle<00:02:23.880> trail<00:02:24.090> oh<00:02:24.300> I<00:02:25.080> do<00:02:25.410> need<00:02:25.650> to<00:02:25.709> get

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
that particle trail oh I do need to get

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.949 
that particle trail oh I do need to get
torch<00:02:26.130> because<00:02:26.340> this<00:02:27.030> is<00:02:27.180> ridiculous<00:02:27.660> I<00:02:27.780> can't

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
torch because this is ridiculous I can't

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.360 
torch because this is ridiculous I can't
see<00:02:28.080> a<00:02:28.110> damn<00:02:28.319> thing

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
it's right-click it's got to be around

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.030 
it's right-click it's got to be around
here<00:02:31.260> somewhere

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
here somewhere

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.220 
here somewhere
well<00:02:32.700> what<00:02:32.910> is<00:02:33.240> that<00:02:33.450> probably<00:02:33.750> a<00:02:33.810> biomes<00:02:34.140> of

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
well what is that probably a biomes of

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.660 
well what is that probably a biomes of
Plenty<00:02:34.500> one<00:02:34.650> but<00:02:35.010> let's<00:02:35.130> just<00:02:35.280> keep<00:02:35.400> going

it's found it so yeah you can see it's
functional<00:02:49.230> with<00:02:49.410> diamonds<00:02:49.890> as<00:02:49.980> well<00:02:50.010> just<00:02:50.610> a

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
functional with diamonds as well just a

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.970 
functional with diamonds as well just a
really<00:02:50.910> cool<00:02:51.120> and<00:02:51.330> easy<00:02:51.630> way<00:02:51.959> to<00:02:52.019> find<00:02:52.470> the

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
really cool and easy way to find the

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.320 
really cool and easy way to find the
nearest<00:02:53.250> source<00:02:53.550> of<00:02:53.760> the<00:02:53.880> all<00:02:54.030> that<00:02:54.209> you

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
nearest source of the all that you

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.729 
nearest source of the all that you
really<00:02:54.540> want<00:02:54.720> which<00:02:54.900> is<00:02:55.050> diamond<00:02:55.410> of<00:02:55.530> course

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
really want which is diamond of course

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.470 
really want which is diamond of course
so<00:02:56.310> let's<00:02:56.459> just<00:02:56.610> go<00:02:56.730> back<00:02:56.940> up<00:02:57.090> to<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.269> surface

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
so let's just go back up to the surface

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.180 
so let's just go back up to the surface
but<00:02:58.110> I<00:02:58.170> think<00:02:58.350> next<00:02:58.500> up<00:02:58.709> I'm<00:02:58.860> going<00:02:58.950> to<00:02:59.010> pop

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
but I think next up I'm going to pop

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.979 
but I think next up I'm going to pop
into<00:02:59.370> the<00:02:59.550> nether<00:02:59.820> and<00:03:00.209> then<00:03:00.540> try<00:03:00.750> and<00:03:00.870> locate

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
into the nether and then try and locate

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.930 
into the nether and then try and locate
some<00:03:01.440> nether<00:03:01.680> ores<00:03:01.920> and<00:03:02.310> look<00:03:02.430> we've<00:03:02.580> stumbled

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
some nether ores and look we've stumbled

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.660 
some nether ores and look we've stumbled
upon<00:03:03.150> a<00:03:03.510> cave<00:03:04.019> system<00:03:04.260> here<00:03:04.680> so<00:03:05.280> here<00:03:05.550> we<00:03:05.640> are

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
upon a cave system here so here we are

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.009 
upon a cave system here so here we are
in<00:03:05.850> the<00:03:05.940> nether<00:03:06.090> and<00:03:06.390> I<00:03:06.510> can<00:03:06.630> actually<00:03:06.720> see

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
in the nether and I can actually see

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.690 
in the nether and I can actually see
some<00:03:07.260> courts<00:03:07.590> already<00:03:07.920> so<00:03:08.370> I'm<00:03:08.459> not<00:03:08.550> actually

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
some courts already so I'm not actually

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.580 
some courts already so I'm not actually
going<00:03:08.910> to<00:03:08.970> need<00:03:09.090> to<00:03:09.269> use<00:03:09.510> the<00:03:09.720> center<00:03:10.140> thing<00:03:10.380> oh

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
going to need to use the center thing oh

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.800 
going to need to use the center thing oh
but<00:03:11.070> I<00:03:11.100> am<00:03:11.160> anyway<00:03:11.610> so<00:03:11.880> let's<00:03:12.060> just<00:03:12.269> select<00:03:12.450> a

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
but I am anyway so let's just select a

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.600 
but I am anyway so let's just select a
what<00:03:13.170> is<00:03:13.290> it<00:03:13.410> court<00:03:13.860> here<00:03:14.250> we<00:03:14.340> go

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
what is it court here we go

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.220 
what is it court here we go
and<00:03:14.700> now<00:03:15.150> let's<00:03:15.540> right-click<00:03:15.750> and<00:03:16.080> it's

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
and now let's right-click and it's

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.390 
and now let's right-click and it's
actually<00:03:16.500> saying<00:03:16.739> that<00:03:17.010> there's<00:03:17.130> actually

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
actually saying that there's actually

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.580 
actually saying that there's actually
some<00:03:17.430> up<00:03:17.940> here<00:03:18.000> which<00:03:18.450> is<00:03:18.570> nearer<00:03:18.810> to<00:03:18.870> me<00:03:19.110> so

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
some up here which is nearer to me so

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:20.750 
some up here which is nearer to me so
let's<00:03:19.739> just<00:03:19.769> dig<00:03:20.040> up<00:03:20.130> here<00:03:20.310> and<00:03:20.430> see<00:03:20.579> if<00:03:20.640> it's

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
let's just dig up here and see if it's

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.060 
let's just dig up here and see if it's
correct<00:03:21.120> yep<00:03:21.570> it's<00:03:21.810> bang-on<00:03:22.260> accurate<00:03:22.709> we<00:03:23.040> can

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
correct yep it's bang-on accurate we can

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.680 
correct yep it's bang-on accurate we can
now<00:03:23.250> find<00:03:23.459> courts<00:03:23.820> a<00:03:23.910> lot<00:03:24.090> easier<00:03:24.420> in<00:03:24.600> the

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
now find courts a lot easier in the

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.180 
now find courts a lot easier in the
nether<00:03:24.870> so<00:03:25.320> if<00:03:25.380> you're<00:03:25.500> building<00:03:25.769> some<00:03:25.950> big

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
nether so if you're building some big

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.220 
nether so if you're building some big
buildings<00:03:26.670> out<00:03:26.820> of<00:03:26.850> quartz<00:03:27.239> blocks<00:03:27.510> this<00:03:28.019> is<00:03:28.079> a

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
buildings out of quartz blocks this is a

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.350 
buildings out of quartz blocks this is a
big<00:03:28.530> help<00:03:28.799> because<00:03:28.980> most<00:03:29.610> of<00:03:29.760> the<00:03:29.850> courts<00:03:30.120> in

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
big help because most of the courts in

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.940 
big help because most of the courts in
the<00:03:30.480> nether<00:03:30.660> is<00:03:30.840> hidden<00:03:31.170> and<00:03:31.350> you<00:03:31.709> can<00:03:31.829> only

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
the nether is hidden and you can only

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:33.770 
the nether is hidden and you can only
generally<00:03:32.489> mind<00:03:32.760> it<00:03:32.970> all<00:03:33.090> that's<00:03:33.390> on<00:03:33.600> this

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
generally mind it all that's on this

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.690 
generally mind it all that's on this
surface<00:03:34.230> which<00:03:34.709> kind<00:03:35.010> of<00:03:35.070> restricts<00:03:35.610> the

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
surface which kind of restricts the

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.550 
surface which kind of restricts the
amount<00:03:35.940> of<00:03:36.060> them<00:03:36.209> or<00:03:36.480> you<00:03:36.630> can<00:03:36.750> get<00:03:36.930> but<00:03:37.320> now

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
amount of them or you can get but now

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.650 
amount of them or you can get but now
using<00:03:38.190> this<00:03:38.340> you<00:03:38.549> can<00:03:38.579> easily<00:03:38.880> find<00:03:39.239> courts

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
using this you can easily find courts

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.690 
using this you can easily find courts
and<00:03:39.900> get<00:03:40.290> loads<00:03:40.590> of<00:03:40.769> building<00:03:41.130> supplies<00:03:41.220> for

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
and get loads of building supplies for

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.699 
and get loads of building supplies for
making<00:03:41.970> some<00:03:42.150> epic<00:03:42.480> palaces<00:03:42.989> out<00:03:43.350> of<00:03:43.560> some

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
making some epic palaces out of some

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.770 
making some epic palaces out of some
courts<00:03:44.070> let's<00:03:44.549> actually<00:03:44.730> try<00:03:45.120> test<00:03:45.540> it<00:03:45.690> out<00:03:45.720> on

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
courts let's actually try test it out on

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.170 
courts let's actually try test it out on
glowstone<00:03:46.410> as<00:03:46.590> well<00:03:46.769> so<00:03:47.250> let's<00:03:47.400> go<00:03:47.549> around<00:03:48.000> to

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
glowstone as well so let's go around to

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.150 
glowstone as well so let's go around to
the<00:03:48.269> glowstone<00:03:48.989> one<00:03:49.200> it's<00:03:49.650> actually<00:03:49.920> saying

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
the glowstone one it's actually saying

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.699 
the glowstone one it's actually saying
down<00:03:50.459> here<00:03:50.730> is<00:03:50.850> some<00:03:50.970> glowstone<00:03:51.390> at<00:03:52.079> 20<00:03:52.500> blocks

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
down here is some glowstone at 20 blocks

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.890 
down here is some glowstone at 20 blocks
away<00:03:52.920> so<00:03:53.400> let's<00:03:53.549> just<00:03:53.730> go<00:03:53.850> down<00:03:54.090> here<00:03:54.360> and<00:03:54.450> yep

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:54.900 
away so let's just go down here and yep

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.170 
away so let's just go down here and yep
there<00:03:55.140> we<00:03:55.230> go<00:03:55.380> the<00:03:55.739> nearest<00:03:56.130> erm<00:03:56.370> glowstone<00:03:56.940> is

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
there we go the nearest erm glowstone is

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.600 
there we go the nearest erm glowstone is
here<00:03:57.989> and<00:03:58.260> yet<00:03:58.920> so<00:03:59.070> it<00:03:59.160> works<00:03:59.340> perfectly

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
here and yet so it works perfectly

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.240 
here and yet so it works perfectly
really<00:04:00.480> good<00:04:00.630> way<00:04:00.780> of<00:04:00.810> locating<00:04:01.110> ores<00:04:01.680> so

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
really good way of locating ores so

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:03.890 
really good way of locating ores so
that's<00:04:02.610> pretty<00:04:02.760> much<00:04:02.850> everything<00:04:03.090> for<00:04:03.720> the

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
that's pretty much everything for the

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.020 
that's pretty much everything for the
center<00:04:04.380> mod<00:04:04.590> it<00:04:04.920> just<00:04:05.130> enables<00:04:05.340> you<00:04:05.549> to<00:04:05.579> locate

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
center mod it just enables you to locate

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.190 
center mod it just enables you to locate
ores<00:04:06.239> really<00:04:06.630> easily

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
ores really easily

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.050 
ores really easily
and<00:04:07.290> it<00:04:07.590> is<00:04:07.680> a<00:04:07.709> bit<00:04:07.920> cheaty<00:04:08.310> but<00:04:08.549> if<00:04:08.700> you<00:04:08.820> really

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
and it is a bit cheaty but if you really

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.759 
and it is a bit cheaty but if you really
want<00:04:09.209> to<00:04:09.299> find<00:04:09.480> loads<00:04:09.780> of<00:04:09.959> building<00:04:10.290> materials

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
want to find loads of building materials

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:12.740 
want to find loads of building materials
like<00:04:10.980> quartz<00:04:11.549> and<00:04:11.700> the<00:04:11.760> nether<00:04:11.910> it<00:04:12.269> is<00:04:12.420> a<00:04:12.450> real

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
like quartz and the nether it is a real

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.420 
like quartz and the nether it is a real
help<00:04:13.049> and<00:04:13.290> it's<00:04:13.560> very<00:04:13.739> good<00:04:13.920> it's<00:04:14.310> a<00:04:14.340> good

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
help and it's very good it's a good

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.789 
help and it's very good it's a good
alternative<00:04:15.000> to<00:04:15.030> x-ray<00:04:15.540> mods<00:04:16.169> which<00:04:16.500> just

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
alternative to x-ray mods which just

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.409 
alternative to x-ray mods which just
like<00:04:16.919> get<00:04:17.190> rid<00:04:17.310> of<00:04:17.370> all<00:04:17.489> the<00:04:17.609> stone<00:04:17.850> and<00:04:18.120> show

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
like get rid of all the stone and show

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:19.219 
like get rid of all the stone and show
the<00:04:18.570> ores

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
the ores

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:20.659
