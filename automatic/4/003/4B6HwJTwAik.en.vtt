00:00:21.292 --> 00:00:25.463
A Fool Like No Other

00:00:26.797 --> 00:00:31.010
A Fool Like No Other

00:00:32.136 --> 00:00:36.348
A Fool Like No Other

00:00:37.391 --> 00:00:43.022
A Fool Like No Other

00:00:52.823 --> 00:00:56.827
You had it all
Chose to rise and fall

00:00:57.703 --> 00:01:02.041
Lived the big dream
Went for the extreme

00:01:02.375 --> 00:01:06.337
Chance of a Lifetime
Lost in the wild side

00:01:06.337 --> 00:01:11.425
Learned the hard way
Your crime didn't pay

00:01:12.551 --> 00:01:16.389
Felt almost divine
Crossed the line
(Thou shalt not kill)

00:01:17.098 --> 00:01:21.394
Stupid at the most
Sleep with your ghost
(Thou shalt not kill)

00:01:22.186 --> 00:01:25.731
All time fuck up
Shit out of luck
(Thou shalt not kill)

00:01:26.816 --> 00:01:34.532
Bitter is the taste
End up in disgrace

00:01:46.252 --> 00:01:50.005
You had it all
Chose to rise and fall

00:01:50.339 --> 00:01:55.386
Lived the big dream
Went for the extreme

00:01:55.386 --> 00:01:59.682
Chance of a Lifetime
Lost in the wild side

00:01:59.682 --> 00:02:04.520
Learned the hard way
Your crime didn't pay

00:02:05.563 --> 00:02:09.817
Felt almost divine
Crossed the line
(Thou shalt not kill)

00:02:10.526 --> 00:02:15.156
Stupid at the most
Sleep with your ghost
(Thou shalt not kill)

00:02:15.156 --> 00:02:19.493
All time fuck up
Shit out of luck
(Thou shalt not kill)

00:02:20.244 --> 00:02:28.919
Bitter is the taste
End up in disgrace

00:02:39.096 --> 00:02:44.060
A Fool Like No Other

00:02:45.144 --> 00:02:49.482
A Fool Like No Other

00:02:49.565 --> 00:02:54.737
A Fool Like No Other

00:02:54.862 --> 00:03:02.119
A Fool Like No Other
