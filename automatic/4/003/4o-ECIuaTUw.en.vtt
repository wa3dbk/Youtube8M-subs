00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.750
Listening to the beat the DJ's playing and thumping.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.450
Our eyes just met. You've caught me and I'm falling so deeply.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.990
So, maybe if I get a little closer tonight...

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.150
Side by side, you and I

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.230
Could dance the night away.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.770
Just can't turn away. I think I've lost all my senses.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.450
Right now, I can't decide if I should ask for your name.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.710
So, baby, won't you give me just a bit of your time?

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.170
People stare. I don't care.

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.250
I'm really giving in.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.310
Realize

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.950
That change is happening.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.050
Can't deny

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:11.750
I'm feeling limitless.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.770
Here, tonight,

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.490
Please let me see the stars,

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.450
Find a sign.

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.020
"Time is money."

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.170
Or that's what they say.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.610
"Sweet as honey."

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.730
There's something I'm craving.

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.370
See the world as

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:29.790
a place for mistakes.

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.090
Love just blinds me,

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.210
But you have shown me the way.

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:35.890
"Time is money."

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.870
Or that's what they say.

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.570
"Sweet as honey."

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.790
There's something I'm craving.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.390
See the world as

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:44.910
a place for mistakes.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.310
Outside, looking in.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:54.910
You're written in my memory. I can't erase this.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:02.610
The thought of being's fleeting. Chasing a dream.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.970
No longer counting minutes, I can't control it.

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:19.430
This change inside has got me. Now, I can't look away.

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.770
Pulling up a ride so maybe I can convince you

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.430
The road we'll take tonight stretches from here to the middle.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.030
Don't let me ask you twice and let's go for a drive.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.170
Take me there. Anywhere.

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.230
You always lead me astray.

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.770
Captured in your eyes. I know my gaze may just linger.

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.510
The starry lights rush by and I am caught at a standstill.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.970
No questions here this evening. I am fighting inside.

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.130
Sitting here. Do I dare?

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.250
Let's spend the night away.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.350
Even if

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:08.030
We fail a thousand times,

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.130
We can't take

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:11.150
This chance for granted.

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.870
So, take this night

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.450
And drive a million miles.

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.790
Once again...

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:24.670
Beginning from the center, I can't remember.

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:33.110
But when I look again, some pieces remain.

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:39.550
No longer do I notice painful refrains when

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:49.290
Defining all my memories each time I stay awake.

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:20.890
"Time is money."

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:22.250
Or that's what they say.

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.590
"Sweet as honey."

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.810
There's something I'm craving.

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.390
See the world as

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.470
a place for mistakes.

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.130
Love just blinds me,

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.210
But you have shown me the way.

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:35.870
"Time is money."

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.250
Or that's what they say.

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:39.590
"Sweet as honey."

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:41.670
There's something I'm craving.

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:43.430
See the world as

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:44.990
a place for mistakes...

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:55.150
You're written in my memory. I can't erase this.

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:02.570
The thought of being's fleeting. Chasing a dream.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:09.550
No longer counting minutes, I can't control it.

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:19.330
This change inside has got me. Now, I can't look away.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:35.790
"Time is money."

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:37.430
Or that's what they say.

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:39.950
"Sweet as honey..."

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:43.590
See the world as

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.450
a place for mistakes.

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:47.090
Love just blinds me...

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:50.890
"Time is money."

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:52.250
Or that's what they say.

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:54.590
"Sweet as honey..."

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:58.430
See the world as

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.230
a place for mistakes...
