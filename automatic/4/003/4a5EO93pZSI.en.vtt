of<00:00:04.740> the<00:00:05.009> camera<00:00:05.370> that<00:00:05.520> I<00:00:05.549> shoot<00:00:05.819> most<00:00:06.120> of<00:00:06.299> my

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
of the camera that I shoot most of my

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.480 
of the camera that I shoot most of my
videos<00:00:06.569> with<00:00:07.080> because<00:00:07.799> everyone<00:00:08.160> seems<00:00:08.400> to

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
videos with because everyone seems to

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.100 
videos with because everyone seems to
ask<00:00:08.700> me<00:00:09.030> shortly<00:00:09.330> after<00:00:09.599> they<00:00:09.719> watch<00:00:09.870> one<00:00:10.080> of

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
ask me shortly after they watch one of

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.900 
ask me shortly after they watch one of
my<00:00:10.200> videos<00:00:10.290> which<00:00:11.130> maybe<00:00:11.280> says<00:00:11.610> that<00:00:11.820> the

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
my videos which maybe says that the

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.129 
my videos which maybe says that the
content<00:00:12.300> isn't<00:00:12.450> so<00:00:12.660> good<00:00:12.840> because<00:00:12.960> you're

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
content isn't so good because you're

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.390 
content isn't so good because you're
paying<00:00:13.259> attention<00:00:13.440> to<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:13.860> camera<00:00:14.219> but

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
paying attention to the camera but

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.740 
paying attention to the camera but
hopefully<00:00:14.759> I<00:00:14.790> think<00:00:14.880> it's<00:00:15.179> because<00:00:15.450> you<00:00:15.599> think

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
hopefully I think it's because you think

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.570 
hopefully I think it's because you think
that<00:00:15.870> the<00:00:16.139> shots<00:00:16.350> are<00:00:16.529> so<00:00:16.650> clear<00:00:16.980> I<00:00:17.130> should

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
that the shots are so clear I should

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.250 
that the shots are so clear I should
start<00:00:17.789> upfront<00:00:18.000> by<00:00:18.180> saying<00:00:18.420> this<00:00:18.660> video<00:00:18.990> is

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
start upfront by saying this video is

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.990 
start upfront by saying this video is
being<00:00:19.500> shot<00:00:19.680> just<00:00:19.949> with<00:00:20.070> iMovie<00:00:20.550> on<00:00:20.580> my<00:00:20.789> laptop

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
being shot just with iMovie on my laptop

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.640 
being shot just with iMovie on my laptop
so<00:00:21.240> this<00:00:21.630> isn't<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.960> quality<00:00:22.350> that<00:00:22.470> you<00:00:22.560> get

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
so this isn't the quality that you get

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.769 
so this isn't the quality that you get
out<00:00:22.800> of<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:22.980> camera<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.850> camera<00:00:24.060> I<00:00:24.210> use<00:00:24.510> is

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
out of the camera the camera I use is

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.300 
out of the camera the camera I use is
actually<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.140> point-and-shoot<00:00:25.590> camera<00:00:26.099> called

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
actually a point-and-shoot camera called

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.800 
actually a point-and-shoot camera called
the<00:00:26.460> Panasonic<00:00:27.029> Lumix<00:00:27.890> DMC<00:00:28.890> LX<00:00:29.490> 3<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:30.210> this<00:00:30.689> is

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
the Panasonic Lumix DMC LX 3 and this is

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.139 
the Panasonic Lumix DMC LX 3 and this is
the<00:00:30.929> baby<00:00:31.109> right<00:00:31.230> here<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:32.130> lens<00:00:32.669> cover<00:00:32.969> on

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
the baby right here the lens cover on

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.490 
the baby right here the lens cover on
the<00:00:33.239> front<00:00:33.270> is<00:00:33.600> something<00:00:33.870> I<00:00:33.960> paid<00:00:34.230> for

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
the front is something I paid for

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.080 
the front is something I paid for
separate<00:00:35.040> because<00:00:35.190> I<00:00:35.340> tend<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.670> lose<00:00:35.820> lens

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
separate because I tend to lose lens

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.940 
separate because I tend to lose lens
caps<00:00:36.420> it's<00:00:36.660> just<00:00:36.840> like<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:37.050> 15<00:00:37.410> dollar<00:00:37.649> thing

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
caps it's just like a 15 dollar thing

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.130 
caps it's just like a 15 dollar thing
that<00:00:38.160> makes<00:00:38.309> me<00:00:38.460> not<00:00:38.670> lose<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.180> so<00:00:39.360> that<00:00:39.899> looks

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
that makes me not lose it so that looks

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.660 
that makes me not lose it so that looks
neato<00:00:40.410> but<00:00:40.710> doesn't<00:00:40.980> come<00:00:41.100> with<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.250> camera<00:00:41.640> but

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
neato but doesn't come with a camera but

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.170 
neato but doesn't come with a camera but
it's<00:00:41.910> pretty<00:00:42.059> cool<00:00:43.399> so<00:00:44.399> what's<00:00:44.910> really<00:00:45.030> cool

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
it's pretty cool so what's really cool

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.540 
it's pretty cool so what's really cool
about<00:00:45.360> this<00:00:45.690> is<00:00:45.750> it's<00:00:46.320> very<00:00:46.680> similar<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.100> the

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
about this is it's very similar to the

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.450 
about this is it's very similar to the
Leica<00:00:48.530> something<00:00:49.530> M<00:00:49.710> class<00:00:50.010> or<00:00:50.219> something

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
Leica something M class or something

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.010 
Leica something M class or something
like<00:00:50.550> that<00:00:50.760> except<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:51.360> this<00:00:51.510> retails<00:00:51.930> for

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
like that except that this retails for

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.139 
like that except that this retails for
around<00:00:52.289> 4<00:00:52.620> or<00:00:52.649> 500<00:00:53.160> bucks<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.940> Leica

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
around 4 or 500 bucks and the Leica

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.080 
around 4 or 500 bucks and the Leica
camera<00:00:54.750> retails<00:00:55.199> for<00:00:55.289> around<00:00:55.469> 4000<00:00:56.460> bucks<00:00:56.640> so

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
camera retails for around 4000 bucks so

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.080 
camera retails for around 4000 bucks so
it's<00:00:57.629> got<00:00:57.840> like<00:00:58.079> a<00:00:58.109> glass<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.980> it's<00:00:59.579> it's<00:00:59.879> got

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
it's got like a glass and it's it's got

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.930 
it's got like a glass and it's it's got
a<00:01:00.120> very<00:01:00.329> similar<00:01:00.570> style<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:01.949> but<00:01:02.460> it<00:01:02.579> is<00:01:02.730> not

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
a very similar style to it but it is not

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.690 
a very similar style to it but it is not
as<00:01:03.239> expensive<00:01:03.930> by<00:01:04.080> any<00:01:04.320> means<00:01:04.619> it's<00:01:05.189> got<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.460> lot

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
as expensive by any means it's got a lot

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.609 
as expensive by any means it's got a lot
of<00:01:05.729> manual<00:01:06.330> controls<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:07.020> it<00:01:07.140> which<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:07.409> makes

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
of manual controls to it which it makes

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.010 
of manual controls to it which it makes
it<00:01:07.799> for<00:01:08.040> kind<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.280> easy<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.790> it<00:01:09.540> makes<00:01:09.750> it<00:01:09.869> easy

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
it for kind of easy and it makes it easy

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.450 
it for kind of easy and it makes it easy
for<00:01:10.229> me<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.380> do<00:01:10.560> things<00:01:10.710> like<00:01:10.920> shoot<00:01:11.130> video

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
for me to do things like shoot video

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.560 
for me to do things like shoot video
right<00:01:11.700> now<00:01:11.729> I've<00:01:11.970> got<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.180> on<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.330> video

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
right now I've got it on the video

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.390 
right now I've got it on the video
setting<00:01:12.990> I<00:01:13.140> don't<00:01:13.710> know<00:01:13.770> if<00:01:13.860> it's<00:01:13.979> blurry<00:01:14.250> or

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
setting I don't know if it's blurry or

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.649 
setting I don't know if it's blurry or
not<00:01:14.610> but<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:14.820> can<00:01:14.970> see<00:01:15.119> that<00:01:15.330> there's<00:01:15.479> three

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
not but you can see that there's three

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.270 
not but you can see that there's three
different<00:01:15.990> aspect<00:01:16.409> ratios<00:01:16.860> that<00:01:16.890> you<00:01:17.100> could

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
different aspect ratios that you could

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.830 
different aspect ratios that you could
shoot<00:01:17.460> in<00:01:17.640> four<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:18.030> three<00:01:18.390> which<00:01:18.540> is<00:01:18.689> what

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
shoot in four to three which is what

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.810 
shoot in four to three which is what
this<00:01:19.020> is<00:01:19.080> shot<00:01:19.439> in<00:01:19.650> three<00:01:20.250> two<00:01:20.369> two<00:01:20.520> which<00:01:20.670> is<00:01:20.790> a

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
this is shot in three two two which is a

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.450 
this is shot in three two two which is a
little<00:01:20.909> more<00:01:21.180> square<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:21.869> then<00:01:22.320> 16:9<00:01:23.159> which

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
little more square and then 16:9 which

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.670 
little more square and then 16:9 which
is<00:01:23.610> like<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.759> widescreen<00:01:24.360> effect<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.080> I<00:01:25.439> shoot

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
is like a widescreen effect and I shoot

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.260 
is like a widescreen effect and I shoot
most<00:01:25.890> of<00:01:26.070> my<00:01:26.159> video<00:01:26.430> in<00:01:26.580> widescreen<00:01:26.939> just

most of my video in widescreen just
because<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.509> tended<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.229> like<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.590> boxing<00:01:29.070> on

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189

it<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.369> little<00:01:29.460> bit<00:01:29.579> more<00:01:29.880> this<00:01:30.509> also<00:01:30.869> lets<00:01:31.049> me

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
it a little bit more this also lets me

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.080 
it a little bit more this also lets me
shoot<00:01:31.409> in<00:01:31.560> high<00:01:31.740> def<00:01:31.770> it's<00:01:32.520> sort<00:01:32.700> of<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.909> lower

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
shoot in high def it's sort of the lower

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.819

end<00:01:33.329> of<00:01:33.450> high<00:01:33.600> def<00:01:33.869> but<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.110> allows<00:01:34.320> me<00:01:34.560> to<00:01:34.680> do

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
end of high def but it allows me to do

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.550 
end of high def but it allows me to do
pretty<00:01:35.759> nice-looking<00:01:35.970> shots<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.900> because<00:01:37.470> I

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
pretty nice-looking shots and because I

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.859
