00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
around when these things start producing

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:04.229 
around when these things start producing
but<00:03:59.709> I<00:03:59.980> almost<00:04:00.609> see<00:04:01.060> it<00:04:01.150> as<00:04:01.269> a<00:04:03.030> kind<00:04:04.030> of<00:04:04.120> like<00:04:04.209> a

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
but I almost see it as a kind of like a

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:06.630 
but I almost see it as a kind of like a
community<00:04:04.780> act<00:04:05.230> it's<00:04:05.560> like<00:04:05.739> giving<00:04:05.950> back<00:04:06.340> I

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640

community act it's like giving back I
mean<00:04:07.120> there's<00:04:07.359> very<00:04:07.690> few<00:04:08.069> beneficial<00:04:09.069> acts

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
mean there's very few beneficial acts

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.270 
mean there's very few beneficial acts
that<00:04:09.549> you<00:04:09.730> can<00:04:09.940> do<00:04:10.180> but<00:04:10.900> better<00:04:11.530> as<00:04:11.799> good<00:04:12.040> as

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
that you can do but better as good as

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.220 
that you can do but better as good as
planning<00:04:12.639> a<00:04:12.730> fruit<00:04:12.970> tree<00:04:13.180> I<00:04:13.269> mean<00:04:13.540> it<00:04:13.750> helps

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
planning a fruit tree I mean it helps

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.129 
planning a fruit tree I mean it helps
the<00:04:14.889> environment<00:04:15.069> it<00:04:15.790> cleans<00:04:16.150> up<00:04:16.389> the<00:04:16.600> air<00:04:16.630> it

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139 
the environment it cleans up the air it

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:20.339 
the environment it cleans up the air it
produces<00:04:18.070> food<00:04:18.700> that's<00:04:19.150> healthy<00:04:19.269> for<00:04:19.780> people

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:02.290 
you do you create when you get these

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:03.480 
you do you create when you get these
things<00:05:02.500> there's<00:05:02.770> going<00:05:02.890> to<00:05:02.950> be<00:05:02.980> a<00:05:03.070> root<00:05:03.310> ball

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
things there's going to be a root ball

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:05.610 
things there's going to be a root ball
you<00:05:04.450> want<00:05:04.570> to<00:05:04.690> create<00:05:04.870> a<00:05:04.930> hole<00:05:05.110> that's<00:05:05.290> roughly

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
you want to create a hole that's roughly

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.150 
you want to create a hole that's roughly
double<00:05:06.460> the<00:05:06.490> size<00:05:06.760> of<00:05:07.030> the<00:05:07.120> root<00:05:07.270> ball<00:05:08.160> you

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
double the size of the root ball you

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.550 
double the size of the root ball you
want<00:05:09.400> to<00:05:09.520> use<00:05:09.790> dirt<00:05:10.210> that's<00:05:10.510> been<00:05:10.930> amended<00:05:11.350> a

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
want to use dirt that's been amended a

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.620 
want to use dirt that's been amended a
bit<00:05:11.770> so<00:05:12.070> depending<00:05:12.520> on<00:05:12.640> your<00:05:12.760> soil<00:05:13.090> for

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
bit so depending on your soil for

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.420 
bit so depending on your soil for
instance<00:05:13.900> this<00:05:14.020> is<00:05:14.170> kind<00:05:14.410> of<00:05:14.440> clayey<00:05:14.740> soil<00:05:15.160> so

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
instance this is kind of clayey soil so

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.820 
instance this is kind of clayey soil so
what<00:05:15.580> I<00:05:15.610> did<00:05:15.700> was<00:05:15.880> I<00:05:16.240> amended<00:05:16.690> it<00:05:16.810> with<00:05:16.960> a<00:05:17.290> whole

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 
what I did was I amended it with a whole

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.640 
what I did was I amended it with a whole
bunch<00:05:17.860> of<00:05:18.250> peat<00:05:18.550> moss<00:05:18.780> some<00:05:19.780> really<00:05:20.530> good

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
bunch of peat moss some really good

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.810 
bunch of peat moss some really good
compost<00:05:21.990> so<00:05:22.990> just<00:05:23.530> bear<00:05:24.100> it<00:05:24.190> it<00:05:24.280> down<00:05:24.490> there

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:24.820 
compost so just bear it it down there

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.270 
compost so just bear it it down there
and<00:05:25.240> you<00:05:25.600> bury<00:05:25.960> it<00:05:26.140> you<00:05:26.830> want<00:05:27.040> to<00:05:27.130> make<00:05:27.220> sure

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.280 
and you bury it you want to make sure

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.080 
and you bury it you want to make sure
that<00:05:27.700> it's<00:05:28.300> above<00:05:28.750> the<00:05:28.780> graft<00:05:29.400> which<00:05:30.400> I<00:05:30.700> don't

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.090 
that it's above the graft which I don't

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.420 
that it's above the graft which I don't
know<00:05:31.150> if<00:05:31.240> you<00:05:31.300> can<00:05:31.420> see<00:05:31.720> is<00:05:31.810> right<00:05:32.080> here<00:05:32.430> you

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
know if you can see is right here you

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.430 
know if you can see is right here you
want<00:05:33.670> to<00:05:33.760> make<00:05:33.880> sure<00:05:33.910> it<00:05:34.300> is<00:05:34.330> that<00:05:35.140> you<00:05:35.260> don't

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:35.440 
want to make sure it is that you don't

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.550 
want to make sure it is that you don't
do<00:05:35.770> this<00:05:35.950> because<00:05:36.100> it'll<00:05:36.400> rot<00:05:36.700> and<00:05:37.090> also<00:05:38.080> this

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
do this because it'll rot and also this

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.160 
do this because it'll rot and also this
tree<00:05:39.010> can<00:05:39.190> actually<00:05:39.550> sprout<00:05:40.030> roots<00:05:40.240> the<00:05:40.870> above

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:41.170 
tree can actually sprout roots the above

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:43.530 
tree can actually sprout roots the above
portion<00:05:41.740> and<00:05:41.920> it<00:05:42.430> will<00:05:42.550> bypass<00:05:42.730> the<00:05:43.270> dwarf

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:43.540 
portion and it will bypass the dwarf

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:45.930 
portion and it will bypass the dwarf
root<00:05:43.750> stock<00:05:44.110> in<00:05:44.350> the<00:05:44.470> tree<00:05:44.800> will<00:05:45.430> grow<00:05:45.460> to<00:05:45.670> full

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:45.940 
root stock in the tree will grow to full

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.480 
root stock in the tree will grow to full
size<00:05:46.000> so<00:05:46.450> you<00:05:46.480> don't<00:05:46.660> want<00:05:46.810> that<00:05:46.960> to<00:05:47.140> happen

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.490 
size so you don't want that to happen

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:52.950 
size so you don't want that to happen
now<00:05:48.490> you<00:05:49.420> know<00:05:50.610> you<00:05:51.610> just<00:05:51.880> put<00:05:52.360> some<00:05:52.600> mulch

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 
now you know you just put some mulch

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.660 
now you know you just put some mulch
here<00:05:53.170> actually<00:05:53.350> need<00:05:53.650> to<00:05:53.740> apply<00:05:54.070> another

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:54.670 
here actually need to apply another

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:57.840 
here actually need to apply another
layer<00:05:54.810> it's<00:05:55.810> excellent<00:05:56.380> for<00:05:56.700> keeping<00:05:57.700> the

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:57.850 
layer it's excellent for keeping the

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:03.000 
layer it's excellent for keeping the
soil<00:05:58.210> moist<00:05:58.950> and<00:06:00.270> um<00:06:01.270> you<00:06:02.200> know<00:06:02.350> really<00:06:02.650> that's

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:03.010 
soil moist and um you know really that's

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:04.740 
soil moist and um you know really that's
it<00:06:03.250> you<00:06:03.400> can<00:06:03.580> plant<00:06:03.880> anytime<00:06:04.390> the<00:06:04.510> ground

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:04.750 
it you can plant anytime the ground

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.900 
it you can plant anytime the ground
isn't<00:06:04.930> frozen<00:06:05.080> but<00:06:05.980> spring<00:06:06.400> and<00:06:06.550> fall<00:06:06.760> is

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:06.910 
isn't frozen but spring and fall is

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:09.240 
isn't frozen but spring and fall is
better<00:06:07.150> because<00:06:07.390> of<00:06:07.660> the<00:06:07.750> rainfall<00:06:08.560> you<00:06:09.070> don't

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.250 
better because of the rainfall you don't

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.130 
better because of the rainfall you don't
want<00:06:09.400> to<00:06:09.490> get<00:06:09.700> them<00:06:09.820> you<00:06:10.600> know<00:06:10.690> to<00:06:10.720> let<00:06:10.990> them

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:44.980 
way I think to Maine pawpaw trees no one

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:47.730 
way I think to Maine pawpaw trees no one
grows<00:06:45.160> him<00:06:45.370> here<00:06:45.580> why<00:06:46.389> because<00:06:47.169> they<00:06:47.410> don't

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:47.740 
grows him here why because they don't

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.710 
grows him here why because they don't
