00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
the halloween or if I think installed so

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.410 
the halloween or if I think installed so
the<00:00:24.480> sinister<00:00:24.960> or<00:00:25.109> it<00:00:25.380> a<00:00:25.859> boost<00:00:26.430> BB<00:00:26.970> gauge<00:00:27.150> when

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
the sinister or it a boost BB gauge when

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.109 
the sinister or it a boost BB gauge when
attacking<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:28.140> deals<00:00:28.560> extra<00:00:29.189> normal<00:00:29.730> attacks

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:36.380 
attacking and deals extra normal attacks
I<00:00:30.650> think<00:00:31.650> it<00:00:31.769> does<00:00:31.920> double<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:33.079> actual<00:00:35.390> attack

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
I think it does double the actual attack

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.970 
I think it does double the actual attack
count<00:00:38.210> and<00:00:39.210> in<00:00:39.570> this<00:00:39.960> one<00:00:40.260> here<00:00:40.530> halloween

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
crystals while attacking and also kind

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.380 
crystals while attacking and also kind
of<00:00:49.079> doubles<00:00:49.469> your<00:00:49.590> attack<00:00:49.950> count<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.460> this<00:00:51.239> is
