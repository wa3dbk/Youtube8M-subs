John white today we're going to be
talking<00:00:06.589> about<00:00:06.620> some<00:00:06.950> tree<00:00:07.190> problems<00:00:07.700> and<00:00:07.970> as

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:08.060 
talking about some tree problems and as

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:09.700 
talking about some tree problems and as
you<00:00:08.240> can<00:00:08.330> see<00:00:08.480> behind<00:00:08.660> me<00:00:08.930> we<00:00:09.050> have<00:00:09.170> an<00:00:09.410> open

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:09.710 
you can see behind me we have an open

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:11.920 
you can see behind me we have an open
trench<00:00:10.070> and<00:00:10.340> some<00:00:11.030> plant<00:00:11.270> material<00:00:11.690> that<00:00:11.720> has

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:11.930 
trench and some plant material that has

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.830 
trench and some plant material that has
died<00:00:12.200> and<00:00:12.910> one<00:00:13.910> thing<00:00:14.150> that<00:00:14.300> we<00:00:14.390> run<00:00:14.600> across

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:14.840 
died and one thing that we run across

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.320 
died and one thing that we run across
occasionally<00:00:15.830> and<00:00:16.430> we<00:00:16.550> get<00:00:16.760> different<00:00:16.940> calls

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.330 
occasionally and we get different calls

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.840 
occasionally and we get different calls
on<00:00:17.600> it<00:00:17.630> is<00:00:17.930> gas<00:00:18.650> leaks<00:00:19.040> and<00:00:19.340> this<00:00:19.520> is<00:00:19.700> an

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:19.850 
on it is gas leaks and this is an

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.660 
on it is gas leaks and this is an
example<00:00:20.360> of<00:00:20.480> a<00:00:20.570> very<00:00:20.810> large<00:00:21.110> natural<00:00:21.920> gas<00:00:22.370> leak

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:22.670 
example of a very large natural gas leak

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.540 
example of a very large natural gas leak
that<00:00:22.910> happened<00:00:23.270> in<00:00:23.390> this<00:00:23.570> landscape<00:00:24.200> and<00:00:24.550> we

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:25.550 
that happened in this landscape and we

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:26.950 
that happened in this landscape and we
were<00:00:25.700> looking<00:00:25.820> at<00:00:26.119> why<00:00:26.270> some<00:00:26.539> of<00:00:26.570> the<00:00:26.720> plant

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
were looking at why some of the plant

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.170 
were looking at why some of the plant
material<00:00:27.080> died<00:00:27.560> and<00:00:27.980> we<00:00:28.220> started<00:00:29.030> looking

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:29.180 
material died and we started looking

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.229 
material died and we started looking
around<00:00:29.390> and<00:00:30.039> could<00:00:31.039> smell<00:00:31.310> a<00:00:31.369> little<00:00:31.670> odor<00:00:31.820> and

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
around and could smell a little odor and

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:34.569 
around and could smell a little odor and
had<00:00:32.570> the<00:00:32.840> city<00:00:33.260> come<00:00:33.530> out<00:00:33.680> and<00:00:33.950> make<00:00:34.130> a<00:00:34.160> an

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:34.579 
had the city come out and make a an

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:37.300 
had the city come out and make a an
inspection<00:00:35.570> and<00:00:35.900> did<00:00:36.079> find<00:00:36.110> a<00:00:36.440> gas<00:00:36.650> leak<00:00:36.920> so

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:37.310 
inspection and did find a gas leak so

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.880 
inspection and did find a gas leak so
let's<00:00:38.030> talk<00:00:38.329> about<00:00:38.510> natural<00:00:38.870> gas<00:00:39.110> leaks<00:00:39.620> and

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
let's talk about natural gas leaks and

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.560 
let's talk about natural gas leaks and
what<00:00:40.010> it<00:00:40.160> does<00:00:40.370> to<00:00:40.399> landscape<00:00:41.000> material<00:00:41.450> so

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
what it does to landscape material so

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:42.910 
what it does to landscape material so
we'll<00:00:41.720> go<00:00:41.870> over<00:00:41.960> and<00:00:42.110> take<00:00:42.290> a<00:00:42.320> look<00:00:42.440> at<00:00:42.710> some<00:00:42.890> of

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
we'll go over and take a look at some of

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.760 
we'll go over and take a look at some of
the<00:00:43.070> plant<00:00:43.310> material<00:00:47.410> here<00:00:48.410> we<00:00:48.559> have<00:00:48.739> a

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
the plant material here we have a

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.060 
the plant material here we have a
Mexican<00:00:49.399> elder<00:00:50.030> tree<00:00:50.329> that<00:00:50.720> has<00:00:51.320> to<00:00:51.559> come<00:00:51.829> to

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
Mexican elder tree that has to come to

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:53.979 
Mexican elder tree that has to come to
the<00:00:52.250> natural<00:00:52.969> gas<00:00:53.180> that<00:00:53.510> was<00:00:53.630> trapped

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
the natural gas that was trapped

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:55.840 
the natural gas that was trapped
underneath<00:00:54.410> the<00:00:54.680> plastic<00:00:54.920> and<00:00:55.460> moved<00:00:55.670> through

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
underneath the plastic and moved through

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.619 
underneath the plastic and moved through
the<00:00:56.030> soil<00:00:56.320> depending<00:00:57.320> on<00:00:57.500> the<00:00:57.649> type<00:00:57.860> of<00:00:57.890> soil

00:00:58.619 --> 00:00:58.629 
the soil depending on the type of soil

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:01.569 
the soil depending on the type of soil
it's<00:00:59.629> physical<00:01:00.170> make<00:01:00.410> up<00:01:00.649> how<00:01:01.070> well<00:01:01.309> it's

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
it's physical make up how well it's

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:04.299 
it's physical make up how well it's
compacted<00:01:02.260> all<00:01:03.260> makes<00:01:03.620> a<00:01:03.770> difference<00:01:04.129> in<00:01:04.280> how

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
compacted all makes a difference in how

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.459 
compacted all makes a difference in how
this<00:01:04.759> gas<00:01:05.149> will<00:01:05.479> move<00:01:05.719> through<00:01:05.929> the<00:01:06.020> area<00:01:06.109> of

00:01:06.459 --> 00:01:06.469 
this gas will move through the area of

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:08.529 
this gas will move through the area of
course<00:01:06.709> having<00:01:07.009> the<00:01:07.100> plastic<00:01:07.369> on<00:01:07.789> it<00:01:07.939> which<00:01:08.359> we

00:01:08.529 --> 00:01:08.539 
course having the plastic on it which we

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:10.149 
course having the plastic on it which we
don't<00:01:08.749> recommend<00:01:09.139> around<00:01:09.649> landscape

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
don't recommend around landscape

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.209 
don't recommend around landscape
material<00:01:10.700> it<00:01:11.600> helped<00:01:11.959> to<00:01:12.049> trap<00:01:12.409> the<00:01:12.619> gas<00:01:12.799> in<00:01:13.069> it

00:01:13.209 --> 00:01:13.219 
material it helped to trap the gas in it

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:15.129 
material it helped to trap the gas in it
so<00:01:13.429> basically<00:01:13.819> this<00:01:14.270> plant<00:01:14.630> has<00:01:14.869> suffered

00:01:15.129 --> 00:01:15.139 
so basically this plant has suffered

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:18.489 
so basically this plant has suffered
just<00:01:15.469> from<00:01:15.709> lack<00:01:15.920> of<00:01:15.950> oxygen<00:01:16.219> and<00:01:17.259> this<00:01:18.259> is

00:01:18.489 --> 00:01:18.499 
just from lack of oxygen and this is

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:20.739 
just from lack of oxygen and this is
this<00:01:19.009> tree<00:01:19.310> is<00:01:19.490> dead<00:01:19.789> so<00:01:20.119> it's<00:01:20.270> gonna<00:01:20.389> have<00:01:20.600> to

00:01:20.739 --> 00:01:20.749 
this tree is dead so it's gonna have to

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:24.279 
this tree is dead so it's gonna have to
be<00:01:20.899> removed<00:01:21.289> but<00:01:21.709> you<00:01:21.950> can<00:01:22.130> see<00:01:22.340> it<00:01:22.579> just<00:01:23.289> fried

00:01:24.279 --> 00:01:24.289 
be removed but you can see it just fried

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:26.679 
be removed but you can see it just fried
it<00:01:24.560> with<00:01:24.770> the<00:01:25.130> with<00:01:25.639> the<00:01:25.819> leaves<00:01:26.029> on<00:01:26.270> the<00:01:26.299> tree

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
it with the with the leaves on the tree

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:28.959 
it with the with the leaves on the tree
so<00:01:26.899> it<00:01:26.959> was<00:01:27.079> a<00:01:27.109> very<00:01:27.380> quick<00:01:27.590> quick<00:01:28.429> death<00:01:28.700> in

00:01:28.959 --> 00:01:28.969 
so it was a very quick quick death in

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:32.050 
so it was a very quick quick death in
this<00:01:29.119> instance<00:01:29.659> so<00:01:30.409> again<00:01:31.130> we'll<00:01:31.369> take<00:01:31.789> a<00:01:31.849> look

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
this instance so again we'll take a look

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.929 
this instance so again we'll take a look
it's<00:01:32.209> more<00:01:32.450> plant<00:01:32.810> material<00:01:36.789> here's<00:01:37.789> an

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
it's more plant material here's an

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:40.569 
it's more plant material here's an
Indian<00:01:38.270> Hawthorn<00:01:38.779> that<00:01:39.079> was<00:01:39.279> damaged<00:01:40.279> with

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 
Indian Hawthorn that was damaged with

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:42.519 
Indian Hawthorn that was damaged with
again<00:01:40.969> with<00:01:41.240> the<00:01:41.420> natural<00:01:41.810> gas<00:01:42.020> leak

00:01:42.519 --> 00:01:42.529 
again with the natural gas leak

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:43.959 
again with the natural gas leak
you<00:01:42.919> can<00:01:43.009> see<00:01:43.159> we<00:01:43.310> got<00:01:43.429> quite<00:01:43.669> a<00:01:43.729> bit<00:01:43.819> of

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:43.969 
you can see we got quite a bit of

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:46.779 
you can see we got quite a bit of
foliage<00:01:44.270> burn<00:01:44.689> we<00:01:44.869> do<00:01:45.020> have<00:01:45.259> some<00:01:45.499> live<00:01:46.429> tissue

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:46.789 
foliage burn we do have some live tissue

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:49.839 
foliage burn we do have some live tissue
here<00:01:47.179> so<00:01:47.509> now<00:01:48.289> the<00:01:48.349> problems<00:01:48.979> been<00:01:49.189> detected

00:01:49.839 --> 00:01:49.849 
here so now the problems been detected

00:01:49.849 --> 00:01:51.639 
here so now the problems been detected
you<00:01:50.359> know<00:01:50.450> we're<00:01:50.630> trying<00:01:50.779> to<00:01:50.929> get<00:01:51.079> the<00:01:51.319> soil

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
you know we're trying to get the soil

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:54.370 
you know we're trying to get the soil
aerated<00:01:52.429> get<00:01:52.849> some<00:01:52.999> air<00:01:53.179> into<00:01:53.509> it<00:01:53.630> get<00:01:53.840> the<00:01:54.020> gas

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
aerated get some air into it get the gas

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.269 
aerated get some air into it get the gas
out<00:01:54.619> of<00:01:54.799> the<00:01:54.919> soil

00:01:55.269 --> 00:01:55.279 
out of the soil

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:57.969 
out of the soil
and<00:01:55.700> we'll<00:01:56.209> trim<00:01:56.779> the<00:01:56.929> bush<00:01:57.139> back<00:01:57.409> any<00:01:57.709> dead

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
and we'll trim the bush back any dead

00:01:57.979 --> 00:01:59.769 
and we'll trim the bush back any dead
branches<00:01:58.429> go<00:01:58.639> ahead<00:01:58.819> and<00:01:58.909> take<00:01:59.060> those<00:01:59.270> off<00:01:59.569> and

00:01:59.769 --> 00:01:59.779 
branches go ahead and take those off and

00:01:59.779 --> 00:02:01.989 
branches go ahead and take those off and
hopefully<00:01:59.989> we<00:02:00.439> will<00:02:00.649> maybe<00:02:01.579> get<00:02:01.789> some

00:02:01.989 --> 00:02:01.999 
hopefully we will maybe get some

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:03.760 
hopefully we will maybe get some
regrowth<00:02:02.389> and<00:02:02.659> maybe<00:02:02.899> this<00:02:03.109> Bush<00:02:03.409> will<00:02:03.590> go

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
regrowth and maybe this Bush will go

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.729 
regrowth and maybe this Bush will go
ahead<00:02:04.009> and<00:02:04.099> be<00:02:04.249> okay<00:02:04.719> as<00:02:05.719> we<00:02:05.989> look<00:02:06.349> down<00:02:06.529> the

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:06.739 
ahead and be okay as we look down the

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:09.130 
ahead and be okay as we look down the
line<00:02:06.919> there<00:02:07.279> are<00:02:07.390> several<00:02:08.390> plants<00:02:08.869> that<00:02:08.960> are

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
line there are several plants that are

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.600 
line there are several plants that are
completely<00:02:09.590> dead<00:02:09.920> those<00:02:10.190> are<00:02:10.310> going<00:02:10.430> to<00:02:10.490> be

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
completely dead those are going to be

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.030 
completely dead those are going to be
have<00:02:11.000> to<00:02:11.150> be<00:02:11.300> replaced<00:02:11.750> and<00:02:12.470> when<00:02:12.860> we're

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
have to be replaced and when we're

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.990 
have to be replaced and when we're
looking<00:02:13.190> at

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
looking at

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.180 
looking at
you<00:02:14.540> know<00:02:14.630> how<00:02:14.840> to<00:02:14.900> reclaim<00:02:15.410> an<00:02:15.740> area<00:02:16.040> after

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
you know how to reclaim an area after

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.850 
you know how to reclaim an area after
it's<00:02:16.520> been<00:02:16.670> damaged<00:02:17.120> by<00:02:17.300> natural<00:02:17.750> gas<00:02:17.780> we<00:02:18.650> want

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
it's been damaged by natural gas we want

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.040 
it's been damaged by natural gas we want
to<00:02:18.980> open<00:02:19.250> the<00:02:19.400> area<00:02:19.640> up<00:02:19.850> you<00:02:20.690> know<00:02:20.780> we're<00:02:20.960> gonna

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
to open the area up you know we're gonna

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.590 
to open the area up you know we're gonna
need<00:02:21.140> to<00:02:21.440> take<00:02:21.650> the<00:02:21.950> rock<00:02:22.550> and<00:02:22.880> the<00:02:23.030> plastic

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
need to take the rock and the plastic

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.900 
need to take the rock and the plastic
and<00:02:23.780> stuff<00:02:23.990> like<00:02:24.170> that<00:02:24.470> off<00:02:24.710> get<00:02:25.250> the<00:02:25.460> area

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
and stuff like that off get the area

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.090 
and stuff like that off get the area
opened<00:02:26.300> up<00:02:26.450> we<00:02:27.050> may<00:02:27.260> need<00:02:27.470> to<00:02:27.530> till<00:02:27.860> the<00:02:28.070> ground

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
opened up we may need to till the ground

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.850 
opened up we may need to till the ground
to<00:02:28.580> really<00:02:28.820> try<00:02:29.060> and<00:02:29.090> get<00:02:29.300> the<00:02:29.600> the<00:02:30.260> gas<00:02:30.500> smell

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
to really try and get the the gas smell

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.830 
to really try and get the the gas smell
out<00:02:31.100> of<00:02:31.130> the<00:02:31.310> soil<00:02:31.640> and<00:02:31.940> trying<00:02:32.600> to<00:02:32.690> get<00:02:32.810> a

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
out of the soil and trying to get a

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.320 
out of the soil and trying to get a
microorganism<00:02:33.400> population<00:02:34.400> going<00:02:34.640> again<00:02:35.060> and

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
microorganism population going again and

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.900 
microorganism population going again and
once<00:02:36.200> we<00:02:36.410> do<00:02:36.590> that<00:02:36.620> then<00:02:37.100> we<00:02:37.250> can<00:02:37.280> go<00:02:37.610> ahead<00:02:37.790> and

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
once we do that then we can go ahead and

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.290 
once we do that then we can go ahead and
plant<00:02:38.120> back<00:02:38.360> into<00:02:38.810> it<00:02:38.900> but<00:02:39.620> that<00:02:40.010> gas<00:02:40.640> male<00:02:41.000> may

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
plant back into it but that gas male may

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.570 
plant back into it but that gas male may
be<00:02:41.360> very<00:02:41.930> shallow<00:02:42.230> or<00:02:42.650> it<00:02:42.740> could<00:02:42.950> be<00:02:43.070> very<00:02:43.250> deep

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
be very shallow or it could be very deep

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.580 
be very shallow or it could be very deep
so<00:02:43.880> it's<00:02:44.030> going<00:02:44.180> to<00:02:44.240> require<00:02:44.450> a<00:02:44.959> little<00:02:45.320> bit<00:02:45.470> of

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
so it's going to require a little bit of

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.440 
so it's going to require a little bit of
extra<00:02:45.920> work<00:02:46.190> just<00:02:46.580> to<00:02:46.670> make<00:02:46.850> sure<00:02:46.880> that's<00:02:47.239> done

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
extra work just to make sure that's done

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.550 
extra work just to make sure that's done
there<00:02:47.900> so<00:02:48.430> this<00:02:49.430> is<00:02:49.489> kind<00:02:49.880> of<00:02:49.940> what<00:02:50.150> a<00:02:50.560> natural

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
there so this is kind of what a natural

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.540 
there so this is kind of what a natural
gas<00:02:51.770> leak<00:02:52.459> situation<00:02:53.300> kind<00:02:54.020> of<00:02:54.110> looks<00:02:54.320> like

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
gas leak situation kind of looks like

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.800 
gas leak situation kind of looks like
best<00:02:55.550> thing<00:02:55.730> to<00:02:55.760> do<00:02:55.970> is<00:02:56.120> to<00:02:56.330> know<00:02:56.480> where<00:02:56.660> your

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
best thing to do is to know where your

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.110 
best thing to do is to know where your
gas<00:02:56.989> lines<00:02:57.290> run<00:02:57.620> if<00:02:58.190> you<00:02:58.400> are<00:02:58.520> having<00:02:58.730> plant

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
gas lines run if you are having plant

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.750 
gas lines run if you are having plant
problems<00:02:59.900> near<00:03:00.320> those<00:03:00.530> gas<00:03:00.800> line<00:03:01.100> areas<00:03:01.489> then

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
problems near those gas line areas then

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.350 
problems near those gas line areas then
you<00:03:02.390> do<00:03:02.900> want<00:03:03.020> to<00:03:03.140> call<00:03:03.350> the<00:03:03.530> gas<00:03:03.709> company<00:03:03.739> out

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
you do want to call the gas company out

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.729 
you do want to call the gas company out
they<00:03:05.360> do<00:03:05.420> come<00:03:05.780> out<00:03:05.959> especially<00:03:06.080> if<00:03:06.500> it's<00:03:06.650> a

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
they do come out especially if it's a

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.290 
they do come out especially if it's a
leak<00:03:06.920> type<00:03:07.220> situation<00:03:07.850> they'll<00:03:08.000> come<00:03:08.180> out

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:08.300 
leak type situation they'll come out

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.270 
leak type situation they'll come out
very<00:03:08.510> quick<00:03:08.870> they<00:03:09.140> have<00:03:09.320> sophisticated

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
very quick they have sophisticated

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.670 
very quick they have sophisticated
equipment<00:03:11.270> to<00:03:11.480> detect<00:03:11.959> whether<00:03:12.260> there<00:03:12.500> is<00:03:12.650> a

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
equipment to detect whether there is a

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.270 
equipment to detect whether there is a
leak<00:03:13.430> in<00:03:13.670> it<00:03:13.820> and<00:03:14.380> if<00:03:15.380> there<00:03:15.620> is<00:03:15.770> then<00:03:16.070> they'll

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
leak in it and if there is then they'll

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.310 
leak in it and if there is then they'll
shut<00:03:16.880> it<00:03:17.000> off<00:03:17.180> and<00:03:17.420> take<00:03:17.570> care<00:03:17.780> of<00:03:17.840> the<00:03:17.959> problem

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
shut it off and take care of the problem

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.670 
shut it off and take care of the problem
there

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
there

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.000 
there
so<00:03:18.970> again<00:03:19.970> just<00:03:20.000> odd<00:03:20.690> situations<00:03:21.530> that<00:03:21.680> we<00:03:21.830> run

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
so again just odd situations that we run

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.250 
so again just odd situations that we run
across
