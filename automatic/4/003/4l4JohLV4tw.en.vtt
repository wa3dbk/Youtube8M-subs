00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.229
 that the profession of bus driver on a 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.730
 liner service involves more than laps 

00:00:07.229 --> 00:00:10.320
 drive and occasionally stop at one 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.360
 we often stop recently 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.950
 from a media 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.450
 threats and assault and 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.830
 vandalism 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.599
 you will almost forgive your hand slowly 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.099
 that it is already difficult for such a driver 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:24.630
 enough to be safe through it alone 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:26.099
 traffic to come 3 bikes saying that 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.359
 I no I wouldn't her 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.089
 maybe it seems at first 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.739
 an easy job 

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:34.020
 the same round every time and until before 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:35.580
 stamp a few cards 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.710
 but as a bus driver you really have to 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.040
 have eyes everywhere 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.710
 maintain a completely normal service 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.420
 but very useful especially during service 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.560
 in a busy city with hardly any 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.739
 bus lanes 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.809
 the danger lurks every centimeter 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.340
 that requires enormous skill and 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.340
 concentration of the driver 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.120
 I've known line 25 all my life 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.190
 actually my uncle who has you too 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.900
 there was a boy from college 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.880
 where none come to stand my no more 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.010
 with us until that little one is always busy and 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.500
 certain parts land yes the kempstraat 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.880
 on a square that are the 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.590
 busiest points of the line where you 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.580
 just have to pay attention 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.980
 I don't have to just not for it 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.960
 I have to look at myself 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.370
 monitor passengers on the bus 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.750
 I have to watch the traffic 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.580
 therefore also very much my mirrors in the 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.750
 holes tube both outside and inside so 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.650
 I don't just think for myself but me 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.650
 also for the other traffic 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:38.840
 well then it's already rolling and kind of 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:42.020
 Afternoon can be an accident approval 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:45.259
 motorist my bikes with injury 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.430
 it is closed yes unfortunately comes 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:47.899
 there is a training in you at that time 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.240
 yes we must do with 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:51.740
 with the streets we get how 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.960
 narrow it too and how awkward it is at that 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.149
 time is also difficult yet IIG 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.240
 go and look at and certain 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:01.759
 moments it is just millimeter work 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.399
 you are not physically it is not 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.990
 heavy but spiritual is very heavy 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:08.090
 of things happen in the city which 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.580
 cyclists mopeds 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.910
 mobility scooters trucks 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:16.030
 trams everything emerges from all 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.030
 corners 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.019
 I come to you who is for thoughts 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.870
 while the passengers ask 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:25.310
 on my way there I have to go there 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.459
 that must all happen during the trije 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:31.470
 To do this, the driver must all 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:33.690
 times 100% a match 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.330
 especially the pedestrians and cyclists 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.050
 to do with actually sometimes the 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.970
 hardest 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.770
 especially at traffic lights that they are 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.400
 still here thinking I'm going as fast 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.410
 inbetween 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.840
 because yes you just do not have me in the 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.520
 mirror to look and you can those he 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.170
 driving 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.790
 pedestrians who are just behind buses 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.560
 can come from who then think of 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.970
 can still cross 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.950
 within the urban area like a bus 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.290
 gives direction to leave altitude then 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.370
 the fellow traffic serves the bus 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.020
 opportunity 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.590
 so to score to be able to do the stable 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:07.020
 but that does not happen to eat 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.250
 ok mama as good morning 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.260
 well we are going to start with a piece 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.420
 theory go and talk about understeer and 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.890
 upset good sitting position 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.600
 and then we go to the slip track and then 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.760
 we go first 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.260
 make emergency kind of look now we will 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.670
 make sure the bus ends up in the slip 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.770
 but actually you should already be like that 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:26.300
 far not want to come then its whole 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:29.090
 story behind the train was so smart 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:31.290
 normally with a luxury car then 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.730
 comes a car that coach disappear 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.310
 that one to the other side and that 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.989
 shoot longer for that goes my luxury 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.510
 car or all because you pedal on your can 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.620
 the man or woman is already gone 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.780
 but for those the driver's seat one 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.250
 disaster what they have so large vehicle under 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.690
 keep control with those people 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.280
 learning is not easy 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.900
 that bus that is within the meter 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.280
 maybe silent because he has one 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.709
 decent braking force there absolutely 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.170
 actually things happen on that bus 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:57.180
 that opportunity typhus public doesn't foresee that 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.489
 that is so terrible 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.290
 yes that's why it's important for us to 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:02.370
 look far ahead and anticipate 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.600
 on the situation 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.769
 but by the way yes it is sporadic 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.549
 that really should only be an emergency stop 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:09.810
 to make 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:13.320
 take into account a bus driver 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:15.870
 100 people carry such a so that 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:17.790
 his 100 cars 100 bicycles 100 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.470
 mopeds are a bit less 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:22.200
 so that gives a quiet traffic image 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.090
 there is no bus driver then 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.710
 be a lot of pressure back in a come 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.500
 to a man who is still here in time 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.409
 work is not just about us 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.729
 tickets sell tickets off sinclair 

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:33.559
 it is not as easy for us as 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:35.419
 that most people think and that we 

00:04:33.559 --> 00:04:36.860
 sometimes it is best to go all out 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:38.479
 to 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.709
 yes meanwhile good from a 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:41.709
 to let b expire say
