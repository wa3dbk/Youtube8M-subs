00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.330
 the balance is the most unwanted 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.810
 This car has the shock absorbers. 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:24.539
 losers 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:28.500
 the wheel jumps out of control danger to 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.480
 to go on the spine be the noises you 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.369
 with physical discomfort you're right 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.840
 rocking the car you can not 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:39.570
 the bank and this is the role of 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.969
 suspension gives stability and comfort 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:47.730
 beyond the spring bumpers 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:49.710
 trays pull pivot of terminals form the 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.570
 assembly of the moving parts that are 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.980
 under the car 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.300
 when you have a suspension without 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.980
 maintenance the car is completely 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.850
 committed with regard to the 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.680
 stability 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.550
 you can lose the direction anyway you 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.950
 loses control of the car 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.629
 different from the warning engine with lights 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.420
 the panel when something is not going to 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:13.600
 well the parts of the suspension send another 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:15.850
 type of message toc toc is that when you 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.830
 passes and a hole something from 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.130
 this is a sign that some 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:23.440
 component is not legal 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.570
 only with a thorough review 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.820
 by a well trained technician 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.880
 can detect defects still in the 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:33.610
 you can see that it comes from 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:37.300
 presents several problems including 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.550
 this formula is very visible here we have 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.170
 here also the buffer with the problem 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.149
 with leakage already showing the 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.100
 oil leak 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:48.070
 some hanging parts work 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:51.310
 together and go through great efforts to 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.350
 one defect can be sure of the other 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.229
 they become overloaded 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.820
 the buffer is may have blown the 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:59.649
 first after having caused the 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.970
 slack on Sunday night two bulls 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:02.950
 overloads the other items of the 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.890
 suspension on account of it was 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:09.039
 extinguished by this leak, right now 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.899
 present in this suspension in the suspension the 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.390
 suspension checkup must be made at 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.680
 every 10,000 kilometers and lasts half an hour 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.989
 maximum 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.930
 here you can see a part where the 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:23.860
 already corrupted and in this other 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:26.349
 We have the same tray with the 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.080
 search component completely exclude 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:31.629
 intact then you can see the 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.910
 difference of the two components 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:35.800
 This when it's assembled you almost 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.680
 realize the difference 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:42.340
 and remember that some holes may 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.680
 reduce the life of multiple parts to 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.510
 not have problems ahead of time and reduces 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.910
 the speed including the buraka 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.640
 that nothing to sprinkle diesel under the 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:55.150
 petroleum attack on car 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.740
 excess with the rubbers and the main 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.320
 Do you know that one shook to see if the 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.360
 bumper is fine 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:03.100
 forget gives us an accuracy in cases 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.600
 extremes like that for sure it will 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.600
 get reference to pio
