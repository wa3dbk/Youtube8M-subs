00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.099
 which I have long been waiting for this program 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:13.110
 from our developers called over 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:14.519
 amino fx let's get started so guys 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.289
 enter go into the program this program 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.060
 from the studio led tapes from ours with you 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.500
 developers and in general in this 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.960
 the program we will play with you 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.580
 dominoes she immediately meets the table 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.680
 which is worth some beautiful room 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.130
 everything is done well so the first 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.510
 minutes 2 st stuck just for decoration 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.019
 this room and then moved 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.320
 gameplay 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.300
 and the gameplay in this program is very simple 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.280
 rather you and catelyn for example this 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.750
 should have been a lot about and click on 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.489
 start see that the dominoes start 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.309
 tumble one after another and in general it 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.289
 now some kind of pakman or flappy bird 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.000
 God forbid in general we give one of those 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.469
 devices and we see what we have 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.039
 empty table on which we are now with you 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:59.160
 can create i will try to do this 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:01:00.809
 Well, let's see it comes out in general 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.149
 Here is such a crap I came out and 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:07.189
 let's we are her such piled up click on 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.189
 figures ki and then deed 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.140
 Well, in general, I can say a close and a 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:18.329
 now you guys just see an epic 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.979
 fail dominoes of course different 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:21.810
 click on the menu button and we can see 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.360
 that here we can choose a table table and 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.640
 there are quite a lot of different 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.590
 and also various kinds of these 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.970
 dominoes which I somehow decided 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.189
 put such hide and seek afterwards and 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.219
 run all at once in general 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.630
 dominoes here have green red and 

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:38.610
 blue i'm sure the developers 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.280
 will add more new dominoes 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.470
 there are also standard dominoes which 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.479
 usually play eva eva foam i'm here 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.099
 I do here are arranged in such a way 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:53.159
 thinking start and green ok 

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:54.780
 let him and so letting such a certain result 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.149
 I can say that this game is just 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.649

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.429

 10 at the end of it already felt on myself and in 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.360
