Bauer edition of the Ford Bronco got the
automatic<00:00:30.510> transmission<00:00:30.840> I<00:00:31.289> think<00:00:31.980> the

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
automatic transmission I think the

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.400 
automatic transmission I think the
engine<00:00:32.700> is<00:00:32.790> actually<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.180> Ford's<00:00:33.570> 351<00:00:34.230> engine

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
engine is actually a Ford's 351 engine

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.040 
engine is actually a Ford's 351 engine
I'm<00:00:34.680> not<00:00:34.890> exactly<00:00:35.340> sure<00:00:35.550> but<00:00:36.000> I<00:00:36.239> think<00:00:36.870> our

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
I'm not exactly sure but I think our

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.889 
I'm not exactly sure but I think our
website<00:00:37.469> says<00:00:37.770> it's<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.100> 5.8<00:00:38.820> liter<00:00:39.030> v8<00:00:39.750> which

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
website says it's the 5.8 liter v8 which

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.430 
website says it's the 5.8 liter v8 which
would<00:00:40.020> come<00:00:40.410> out<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.829> right<00:00:41.340> about<00:00:41.579> file<00:00:42.030> area

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 
would come out to right about file area

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.350 
would come out to right about file area
351<00:00:43.440> so<00:00:43.710> you<00:00:44.460> got<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.670> running<00:00:44.879> boards<00:00:45.149> on<00:00:45.239> the

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
351 so you got the running boards on the

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.569 
351 so you got the running boards on the
sides<00:00:45.600> for<00:00:45.870> easy<00:00:46.020> access<00:00:46.230> this<00:00:46.620> is<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.950> green

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
color and that is the I guess it's just

is<00:01:45.970> sitting<00:01:46.330> up<00:01:46.420> a<00:01:46.510> lot<00:01:46.660> higher<00:01:46.900> so<00:01:47.140> I'm

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:47.230 
is sitting up a lot higher so I'm

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.260 
is sitting up a lot higher so I'm
assuming<00:01:47.620> it's<00:01:47.830> a<00:01:47.950> suspension<00:01:48.640> lift<00:01:49.120> because

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
assuming it's a suspension lift because

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.110 
assuming it's a suspension lift because
I<00:01:49.330> don't<00:01:49.450> see<00:01:49.540> anybody<00:01:49.720> lift<00:01:50.230> across<00:01:50.440> there

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.120 
I don't see anybody lift across there

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.170 
I don't see anybody lift across there
let's<00:01:52.120> see<00:01:53.070> or<00:01:54.070> actually<00:01:54.430> it<00:01:54.790> might<00:01:54.970> have

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
let's see or actually it might have

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.120 
let's see or actually it might have
about<00:01:55.450> 2<00:01:55.750> inch<00:01:55.930> body<00:01:56.260> left<00:01:56.500> there<00:01:56.770> and<00:01:57.010> it

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
about 2 inch body left there and it

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.420 
about 2 inch body left there and it
looks<00:01:57.250> like<00:01:57.340> different<00:01:58.110> shot<00:01:59.110> suspensions<00:01:59.890> as

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
looks like different shot suspensions as

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.570 
looks like different shot suspensions as
a<00:02:00.460> forces<00:02:01.180> shocks<00:02:02.110> but<00:02:02.350> my<00:02:02.560> uh<00:02:02.590> upgraded

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
a forces shocks but my uh upgraded

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.080 
a forces shocks but my uh upgraded
shocks<00:02:03.910> as<00:02:04.119> well<00:02:04.300> but<00:02:04.530> let's<00:02:05.530> see<00:02:05.760> on<00:02:06.760> the<00:02:06.910> leaf

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
shocks as well but let's see on the leaf

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.070 
shocks as well but let's see on the leaf
springs<00:02:07.450> back<00:02:07.660> here<00:02:09.509> looks<00:02:10.509> like<00:02:10.750> I'm<00:02:10.959> not

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
springs back here looks like I'm not

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.449 
springs back here looks like I'm not
sure<00:02:11.290> if<00:02:11.350> that<00:02:11.380> stock<00:02:11.800> or<00:02:11.980> not<00:02:12.040> but<00:02:12.340> it<00:02:12.400> looks

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
sure if that stock or not but it looks

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.040 
sure if that stock or not but it looks
like<00:02:12.730> it<00:02:12.880> may<00:02:13.000> have<00:02:13.180> a<00:02:13.209> little<00:02:13.840> bit<00:02:14.020> of

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
like it may have a little bit of

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.470 
like it may have a little bit of
suspension<00:02:14.800> lift<00:02:14.950> as<00:02:15.130> well<00:02:15.310> so<00:02:15.489> as<00:02:16.180> we<00:02:16.330> hop

it's got the remote for your radio will

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.959 
it's got the remote for your radio will
pop<00:02:58.570> this<00:02:58.750> hood<00:02:58.989> real<00:02:59.290> quick

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:01.969 

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:03.520 

looks<00:03:02.450> like<00:03:02.689> this<00:03:02.959> is<00:03:03.079> actually<00:03:03.200> where<00:03:03.500> you

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
looks like this is actually where you

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.800 
looks like this is actually where you
roll<00:03:04.099> down<00:03:04.280> the<00:03:04.430> rear<00:03:04.610> window<00:03:04.939> so<00:03:05.150> but<00:03:05.689> it's

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
roll down the rear window so but it's

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.209 
roll down the rear window so but it's
actually<00:03:06.049> pushed<00:03:06.319> in<00:03:06.500> so<00:03:06.530> let<00:03:06.859> me<00:03:06.920> see<00:03:07.069> if<00:03:07.129> I

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:07.219 
actually pushed in so let me see if I

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:15.150 
actually pushed in so let me see if I
can<00:03:07.659> finger<00:03:08.659> in<00:03:08.750> there<00:03:08.870> to<00:03:08.989> work

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.700 

okay<00:03:15.820> there<00:03:16.060> it<00:03:16.210> comes<00:03:16.390> that's<00:03:17.380> sort<00:03:17.650> of

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:17.710 
okay there it comes that's sort of

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:19.080 
okay there it comes that's sort of
pushed<00:03:17.950> in<00:03:18.190> but<00:03:18.400> I'll<00:03:18.490> guess<00:03:18.700> I'll<00:03:18.820> go<00:03:18.970> ahead

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
pushed in but I'll guess I'll go ahead

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.950 
pushed in but I'll guess I'll go ahead
and<00:03:19.210> show<00:03:19.360> you<00:03:19.420> that<00:03:19.510> while<00:03:19.840> we're<00:03:19.960> at<00:03:20.080> it<00:03:21.960> you

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:22.960 
and show you that while we're at it you

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.560 
and show you that while we're at it you
just<00:03:23.110> swing<00:03:23.350> this<00:03:23.530> around<00:03:24.240> this<00:03:25.240> is<00:03:25.330> just<00:03:25.480> if

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
just swing this around this is just if

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.420 
just swing this around this is just if
you<00:03:25.630> haven't<00:03:25.840> seen<00:03:26.110> how<00:03:26.530> the<00:03:26.590> Bronco<00:03:27.040> actually

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
you haven't seen how the Bronco actually

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.730 
you haven't seen how the Bronco actually
works<00:03:27.670> but<00:03:27.910> I<00:03:28.120> say<00:03:28.990> just<00:03:29.170> like<00:03:29.290> a<00:03:29.380> tow<00:03:29.530> gate

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:29.740 
works but I say just like a tow gate

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.310 
works but I say just like a tow gate
there's<00:03:29.950> your<00:03:30.100> nan<00:03:30.280> storage<00:03:30.730> space<00:03:31.030> there

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
there's your nan storage space there

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.820 
there's your nan storage space there
should<00:03:32.320> be<00:03:32.440> good<00:03:32.590> to<00:03:32.710> go<00:03:34.620> right<00:03:35.620> across

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
should be good to go right across

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.480 
should be good to go right across
through<00:03:36.190> there<00:03:36.390> but<00:03:37.830> just<00:03:38.830> pop<00:03:39.130> the<00:03:39.250> hood<00:03:39.370> I'm
