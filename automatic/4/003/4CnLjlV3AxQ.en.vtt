00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.040 
it into their take this arm push up so
it<00:03:08.250> looks<00:03:08.280> like<00:03:08.490> this<00:03:11.090> well<00:03:12.090> actually<00:03:12.390> i'll

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
it looks like this well actually i'll

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.770 
it looks like this well actually i'll
say<00:03:13.470> the<00:03:13.590> articulation<00:03:14.430> that<00:03:15.209> would<00:03:15.390> be<00:03:15.510> smart

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
say the articulation that would be smart

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.360 
say the articulation that would be smart
one<00:03:16.050> set<00:03:16.290> articulation<00:03:17.070> before

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
one set articulation before

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.350 
one set articulation before
transformation<00:03:18.180> that<00:03:18.959> i<00:03:19.020> right<00:03:19.790> so<00:03:20.790> this<00:03:21.120> can

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
transformation that i right so this can

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.500 
transformation that i right so this can
move<00:03:21.510> up<00:03:21.720> this<00:03:22.110> can<00:03:22.470> you<00:03:22.970> you<00:03:23.970> know<00:03:24.090> that

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
move up this can you you know that

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.100 
move up this can you you know that
already<00:03:25.370> the<00:03:26.370> way<00:03:26.490> it<00:03:26.550> can<00:03:26.790> rotate<00:03:27.110> 360

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
already the way it can rotate 360

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.210 
already the way it can rotate 360
degrees<00:03:28.380> around<00:03:28.850> legs<00:03:29.850> move<00:03:30.120> out<00:03:30.300> here<00:03:31.220> knees

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
degrees around legs move out here knees

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.310 
degrees around legs move out here knees
can<00:03:32.459> bend<00:03:32.610> they<00:03:32.820> kind<00:03:33.030> of<00:03:33.090> walk<00:03:33.360> right<00:03:33.780> here<00:03:34.019> so

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
can bend they kind of walk right here so

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.630 
can bend they kind of walk right here so
they're<00:03:34.769> a<00:03:34.800> little<00:03:34.980> bit<00:03:35.130> harder<00:03:35.430> to<00:03:35.459> that<00:03:37.640> back

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
they're a little bit harder to that back

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.940 
they're a little bit harder to that back
to<00:03:38.850> transformation<00:03:39.660> transform<00:03:40.560> them<00:03:40.709> but

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
to transformation transform them but

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.710 
to transformation transform them but

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:13.920 
but i don't know why they decided to

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:18.950

change<00:06:14.790> them<00:06:15.030> into<00:06:15.830> Cybertron<00:06:16.830> so<00:06:17.760> I<00:06:18.180> would
