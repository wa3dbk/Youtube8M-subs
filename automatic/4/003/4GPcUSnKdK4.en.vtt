the<00:00:02.730> netbook<00:00:03.300> is<00:00:03.680> our<00:00:04.680> most<00:00:04.830> popular<00:00:05.190> Mac<00:00:06.230> but

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
the netbook is our most popular Mac but

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.100 
the netbook is our most popular Mac but
what<00:00:07.410> we've<00:00:07.620> what<00:00:08.160> we've<00:00:08.370> done<00:00:08.670> and<00:00:09.090> and<00:00:09.960> we've

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
what we've what we've done and and we've

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.690 
what we've what we've done and and we've
made<00:00:10.290> a<00:00:10.320> habit<00:00:10.769> of<00:00:10.860> doing<00:00:10.980> this<00:00:11.190> if<00:00:11.370> that<00:00:11.400> book

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
made a habit of doing this if that book

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:18.500 
made a habit of doing this if that book
is<00:00:12.019> is<00:00:13.019> we<00:00:13.410> decided<00:00:13.830> just<00:00:14.160> to<00:00:14.639> start<00:00:15.030> over

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.050 

the<00:00:19.050> new<00:00:19.199> MacBook<00:00:19.439> is<00:00:19.890> a<00:00:19.949> quite<00:00:20.340> remarkable

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
the new MacBook is a quite remarkable

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.290 
the new MacBook is a quite remarkable
engineering<00:00:21.900> achievement<00:00:22.789> it<00:00:23.789> really

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
engineering achievement it really

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.010 
engineering achievement it really
represents<00:00:25.109> just<00:00:26.039> a<00:00:26.189> complete<00:00:26.669> revolution<00:00:27.390> in

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:28.020 
represents just a complete revolution in

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:40.440 
represents just a complete revolution in
the<00:00:28.439> way<00:00:28.560> that<00:00:28.740> notebooks<00:00:29.099> are<00:00:29.250> made

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:40.450 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.940 

when<00:00:41.450> traditionally<00:00:42.020> notebooks<00:00:42.530> are<00:00:42.739> made

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:42.950 
when traditionally notebooks are made

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.049 
when traditionally notebooks are made
from<00:00:43.690> multiple<00:00:44.690> parts<00:00:45.520> but<00:00:46.520> the<00:00:46.610> problem<00:00:46.970> is

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
from multiple parts but the problem is

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:49.600 
from multiple parts but the problem is
when<00:00:47.570> you<00:00:47.720> have<00:00:47.750> multiple<00:00:48.710> parts<00:00:49.070> you<00:00:49.250> you<00:00:49.460> add

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
when you have multiple parts you you add

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.020 
when you have multiple parts you you add
size<00:00:50.059> and<00:00:50.449> weight<00:00:50.690> and<00:00:51.140> and<00:00:52.129> you<00:00:52.280> increase<00:00:52.730> the

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
size and weight and and you increase the

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.390 
size and weight and and you increase the
opportunity<00:00:53.600> for<00:00:53.780> failure<00:00:54.170> and<00:00:54.320> that<00:00:54.410> the

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:55.400 
opportunity for failure and that the

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.939 
opportunity for failure and that the
huge<00:00:56.089> breakthrough<00:00:56.660> that<00:00:57.260> we<00:00:57.440> heard<00:00:57.710> with

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
huge breakthrough that we heard with

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:00.970 
huge breakthrough that we heard with
with<00:00:58.190> the<00:00:58.339> MacBook<00:00:58.839> was<00:00:59.839> to<00:01:00.050> replace<00:01:00.379> all<00:01:00.680> of

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
with the MacBook was to replace all of

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.270 
with the MacBook was to replace all of
those<00:01:01.129> parts<00:01:01.640> with<00:01:02.180> just<00:01:02.449> one<00:01:02.780> part<00:01:03.110> and<00:01:03.500> at

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
those parts with just one part and at

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.540 
those parts with just one part and at
one<00:01:04.460> part<00:01:04.729> we<00:01:04.879> called<00:01:05.150> the<00:01:05.239> unibody<00:01:06.550> we

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:07.550 
one part we called the unibody we

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.450 
one part we called the unibody we
figured<00:01:08.030> out<00:01:08.150> a<00:01:08.180> way<00:01:08.509> of<00:01:08.920> being<00:01:09.920> able<00:01:10.070> to<00:01:10.190> make

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
figured out a way of being able to make

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.969 
figured out a way of being able to make
make<00:01:10.940> make<00:01:10.970> the<00:01:11.390> notebook<00:01:11.979> fundamentally

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
sort of a degree of fit and finish that

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.070 
sort of a degree of fit and finish that
we've<00:01:19.610> we've<00:01:19.910> never<00:01:20.180> even<00:01:20.360> dreamed<00:01:20.690> of<00:01:20.840> before

we've we've never even dreamed of before

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.540 
we've we've never even dreamed of before
and<00:01:22.090> the<00:01:23.090> only<00:01:23.420> way<00:01:23.899> to<00:01:24.200> make<00:01:24.619> that<00:01:24.979> one<00:01:25.220> part

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:25.550 
and the only way to make that one part

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.760 
and the only way to make that one part
was<00:01:26.060> to<00:01:26.270> machine<00:01:26.660> it<00:01:26.690> from<00:01:27.020> a<00:01:27.110> single<00:01:27.350> piece<00:01:27.710> of

was to machine it from a single piece of
aluminium<00:01:32.140> aluminium<00:01:33.140> was<00:01:33.590> the<00:01:33.740> ideal<00:01:34.039> choice

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
aluminium aluminium was the ideal choice

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.160 
aluminium aluminium was the ideal choice
for<00:01:34.550> this<00:01:34.640> product<00:01:35.060> because<00:01:35.390> it<00:01:35.420> provides<00:01:36.020> us

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:53.799 
a solid block of aluminum then we go

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:55.920 
a solid block of aluminum then we go
through<00:01:54.009> an<00:01:54.159> extrusion<00:01:54.670> process<00:01:54.880> just<00:01:55.750> kind

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
through an extrusion process just kind

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.590 
through an extrusion process just kind
of<00:01:55.990> like<00:01:56.110> how<00:01:56.229> you<00:01:56.290> make<00:01:56.590> like<00:01:56.920> pasta<00:01:57.189> and<00:01:57.600> the
