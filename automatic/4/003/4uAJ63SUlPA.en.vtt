00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.660
 hello good afternoon friends 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.240
 we inaugurated a new section on the website of the daughter mall 

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:14.349
 modern technology and audiovisual media 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:20.180
 this section like trying to offer you things that are appearing today 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:23.449
 of the international chess scene well also Extremadura 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:24.480
 national 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.099
 jose ferrer a little attention 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:31.529
 one of the latest news that the sensational has not given within the 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.570
 world citic has been 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.280
 I knew that in Cali Kasparov 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.680
 not since I was playing against carpo again but it was 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.610
 the task of the coach had started a new task concretely by working 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.170
 magnus carlsen 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.410
 when this news jumped we did not comment much on 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.890
 in barcelona in moncada we know disputing so cheap of Spain and 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.490
 some great masters 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.990
 they said that really caparrós should be quite overwhelmed money to 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.140
 do this work I do not know if I really 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.140
 the cas parón is charging much more sought after in 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.970
 but what does seem obvious is that they fit him 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.890
 new jail is surprising us 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.400
 in fact to whom by the way the supertorneo of tallin pleasant and average of 4 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.390
 I count his match is almost by Victorian effect some tables 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.750
 and he barely managed the Chinese wang when he fought against martino 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.400
 well it really seems that these lessons you have received from de gary 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.230
 kasparov 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.650
 they are giving their benefit 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.190
 I nevertheless 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.450
 the month set in the min in a position a game that xtf follow live what 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.050
 It happens that the time is rather stormy but from time to time I connected there 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.740
 you try to go a little opposition 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.170
 I was almost with the final position because I was surprised that magnus what 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.580
 has great tactical ability there would have 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.180
 a beautiful shot to finish his game and yet tare 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.860
 for a much more prosaic solution in this position of the opposition than that 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.220
 is saying 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.860
 the white has a strong attack in a counterattack because of the king's weakness 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.770
 black the boxes 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.610
 he is former mayor chci dominated by the horse and the clear penetration route program 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.700
 through the route h3 h6 

00:02:15.539 --> 00:02:19.329
 even threatening a possible pregnancy in two 

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:23.260
 the most is still in this case com 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.879
 in a short time to the clock 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:28.540
 always followed a much more pragmatic solution in fact during the game 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:29.849
 with tópalov 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.849
 on move 37 the horse juice of three 

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:36.909
 the measures 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:38.299
 changed 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:41.299
 cavallo for e3 tama for the 3 

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:45.099
 drama 4 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:47.889
 trying a little bit of counterplay like 

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:48.810
 barely 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.739
 few seconds in the clock after another the clothes played 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.179
 the quillá tackle the black 

00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:58.029
 to lose fast gave because five opted for the 4 could one 

00:02:59.009 --> 00:03:02.139
 arrived at this position is practically indefensible 

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:04.419
 tópalov made one move plus tower 8 

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:07.259
 and after tower c1 of this magnum 

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:10.509
 the world number one to the other cecilio stick when nash 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:14.099
 this was how the game went and 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:15.449
 i max mosley 

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:18.449
 scored his second consecutive victory in this super tournament 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:22.389
 but nevertheless more we had a solution 

00:03:24.249 --> 00:03:26.209
 maybe a lot more attractive 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:29.329
 in this position the initial position 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:33.500
 that he did not think that maybe he gave them the solution so simple that he did not 

00:03:33.499 --> 00:03:35.549
 He sought beauty not but 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.569
 to us as amateurs like 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:39.439
 between test tubes of power 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:42.689
 good q only spectacular auction in this case aguad damache 3 

00:03:45.089 --> 00:03:47.069
 it's a very strong play 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:52.089

00:03:52.619 --> 00:03:53.880

 i cavallo https three mates 

00:03:57.229 --> 00:04:01.829
 therefore it seems that it is the only move what pro measures can do 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:04.319
 defend this reaction 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:08.039
 and this is where that very nice little bright sequence lives 

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:09.359
 It allows 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:12.359
 the game ends quickly 

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:16.099
 lady for h 8 sacrificing the branch 30 h 8 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:19.669
 and now after tower h 1 do what the king does 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.749
 the mere ones lose the lama in this case 

00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:26.749
 if for example play rules 7 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.360
 it's easy to see what 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.279
 that towers and 7 wins rampla dama 

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:34.990
 icbc eight as they perceive 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.550
 here is double d 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.539
 well all this we end here and well we wish that the more does not follow 

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:43.439
 forward 

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:47.029
 already among the five best in the world and probably in the next 

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:50.029
 cycle because a global time once it happens 

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:52.610
 expected duel between 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.379
 anand and tópalov 

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:56.900
 we can talk about what else is going to be a serious 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.900
 very serious contender to take the title of world champion 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:01.930
 up to the same
