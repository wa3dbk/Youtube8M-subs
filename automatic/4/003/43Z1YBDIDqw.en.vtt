no matter what level high school
colleagues<00:00:27.300> Pro<00:00:28.699> aim<00:00:29.699> everything<00:00:30.420> at<00:00:30.630> okay

colleagues Pro aim everything at okay

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.920 
colleagues Pro aim everything at okay
and<00:00:32.570> out<00:00:33.570> of<00:00:33.630> that<00:00:33.960> comes<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.890> idea<00:00:35.010> of<00:00:35.930> the

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
and out of that comes the idea of the

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.340 
and out of that comes the idea of the
the<00:00:36.980> three-step<00:00:37.980> read<00:00:38.370> now<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.450> lot<00:00:39.989> of<00:00:40.079> people

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
the three-step read now a lot of people

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.979 
the three-step read now a lot of people
get<00:00:40.530> this<00:00:40.739> confused<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.149> so<00:00:42.660> as<00:00:42.809> I<00:00:42.930> get

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
get this confused and and so as I get

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.729 
get this confused and and so as I get
going<00:00:43.140> if<00:00:43.760> you<00:00:44.760> want<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.230> jump<00:00:46.230> into<00:00:46.410> something

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
going if you want to jump into something

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.250 
going if you want to jump into something
just<00:00:47.070> far<00:00:47.550> away<00:00:47.789> but<00:00:47.850> at<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.809> end<00:00:48.989> of<00:00:49.170> the

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
just far away but at the end of the

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.650 
just far away but at the end of the
third<00:00:49.500> step<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:50.129> think<00:00:50.160> he<00:00:50.789> will<00:00:50.969> know<00:00:51.239> what

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
third step I think he will know what

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.479 
third step I think he will know what
he's<00:00:51.899> going<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.289> do<00:00:52.590> because<00:00:52.980> he's<00:00:53.190> going<00:00:53.399> to

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
he's going to do because he's going to

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.029 
he's going to do because he's going to
either<00:00:53.699> bounce<00:00:54.030> out<00:00:54.420> or<00:00:54.719> he's<00:00:55.320> gonna<00:00:55.620> put<00:00:55.890> his

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
either bounce out or he's gonna put his

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.119 
either bounce out or he's gonna put his
foot<00:00:56.250> in<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.370> ground<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.850> go<00:00:57.840> downhill<00:00:58.079> okay

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
foot in the ground and go downhill okay

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.910 
foot in the ground and go downhill okay
and<00:00:59.430> when<00:01:00.300> I<00:01:00.329> say<00:01:00.600> go<00:01:00.780> downhill<00:01:00.989> I<00:01:01.440> mean<00:01:01.649> he's

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
and when I say go downhill I mean he's

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.399 
and when I say go downhill I mean he's
gonna<00:01:02.129> then<00:01:02.489> turn<00:01:02.820> north<00:01:03.120> he's<00:01:03.570> going<00:01:03.989> that

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
gonna then turn north he's going that

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.130 
gonna then turn north he's going that
way<00:01:04.619> or<00:01:04.860> he's<00:01:05.400> gonna<00:01:05.640> bounce<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.900> third

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
way or he's gonna bounce and the third

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.800 
way or he's gonna bounce and the third
step<00:01:07.470> is<00:01:07.770> when<00:01:08.130> he<00:01:08.610> will<00:01:08.790> know<00:01:09.090> which<00:01:09.420> one<00:01:09.659> it

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
step is when he will know which one it

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:10.039 
step is when he will know which one it
is

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
is

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.950 
is
but<00:01:10.680> it'll<00:01:10.950> take<00:01:11.220> him<00:01:12.110> four<00:01:13.110> or<00:01:13.140> five<00:01:14.960> to

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
but it'll take him four or five to

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.230 
but it'll take him four or five to
actually<00:01:16.590> get<00:01:16.799> his<00:01:17.009> body<00:01:17.340> in<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.700> position<00:01:17.970> to

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
actually get his body in a position to

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.320 
actually get his body in a position to
do<00:01:18.450> which<00:01:18.720> one<00:01:18.990> of<00:01:19.020> those<00:01:19.229> two<00:01:19.530> he's<00:01:19.770> gonna<00:01:19.950> do

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
do which one of those two he's gonna do

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.969 
do which one of those two he's gonna do
so<00:01:21.330> he's<00:01:21.540> going<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.780> get<00:01:21.960> his<00:01:22.200> foot<00:01:22.500> ready<00:01:22.799> to

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
so he's going to get his foot ready to

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.690 
so he's going to get his foot ready to
plant<00:01:23.280> here<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:23.670> go<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:24.090> way<00:01:24.299> or<00:01:25.400> he's<00:01:26.400> gonna

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
plant here and go that way or he's gonna

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.460 
plant here and go that way or he's gonna
take<00:01:27.180> that<00:01:27.450> foot<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:28.610> go<00:01:29.610> that<00:01:29.820> way<00:01:30.000> okay<00:01:30.470> well

not have any other choices there is not
I<00:01:37.200> cut<00:01:37.650> back<00:01:37.890> theory<00:01:38.310> but<00:01:38.759> if<00:01:39.000> you<00:01:39.150> study<00:01:39.509> the

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
I cut back theory but if you study the

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.550 
I cut back theory but if you study the
film<00:01:40.020> if<00:01:40.259> you<00:01:40.500> study<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.159> way<00:01:41.460> it's<00:01:41.700> textured

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
film if you study the way it's textured

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.330 
film if you study the way it's textured
the<00:01:43.560> cut<00:01:43.890> back<00:01:44.189> is<00:01:44.460> geared<00:01:45.149> off<00:01:45.420> of<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.860> aiming

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
the cut back is geared off of the aiming

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.899 
the cut back is geared off of the aiming
spots<00:01:47.700> of<00:01:48.170> what<00:01:49.170> is<00:01:49.409> happening<00:01:49.950> up<00:01:50.100> here<00:01:50.130> okay

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
spots of what is happening up here okay

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.450 
spots of what is happening up here okay
and<00:01:51.149> this<00:01:51.689> is<00:01:51.750> where<00:01:52.140> as<00:01:52.409> we<00:01:52.799> evolve<00:01:53.189> we

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
and this is where as we evolve we

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.940 
and this is where as we evolve we
realize<00:01:53.850> how<00:01:54.090> much<00:01:54.380> information<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.560> was<00:01:55.710> out

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
realize how much information it was out

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.100 
realize how much information it was out
there<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.369> how<00:01:56.850> much<00:01:56.909> we<00:01:57.240> could<00:01:57.479> share<00:01:57.869> and

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
there and how much we could share and

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.350 
there and how much we could share and
learn<00:01:58.380> when<00:01:58.860> we<00:01:59.009> studied<00:01:59.579> film<00:01:59.939> and<00:02:00.270> that's

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
learn when we studied film and that's

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.240 
learn when we studied film and that's
part<00:02:00.780> of<00:02:00.840> what<00:02:01.020> you're<00:02:01.649> gonna<00:02:01.799> even<00:02:02.070> be

damn answers we were just trying to find

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.110 
damn answers we were just trying to find
a<00:02:17.170> way<00:02:17.320> to<00:02:17.380> get<00:02:17.590> the<00:02:17.740> ball<00:02:17.920> out<00:02:18.190> on<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:18.880> edge

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
a way to get the ball out on the edge

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.190 
a way to get the ball out on the edge
and<00:02:19.510> not<00:02:20.380> be<00:02:21.010> a<00:02:21.220> cutback<00:02:21.940> now<00:02:22.510> I<00:02:22.540> don't<00:02:22.840> call

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
and not be a cutback now I don't call

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.270 
and not be a cutback now I don't call
that<00:02:23.230> a<00:02:23.800> cutback<00:02:24.280> okay<00:02:24.960> and<00:02:25.960> I<00:02:26.740> have<00:02:26.920> a<00:02:26.950> way<00:02:27.160> of

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
that a cutback okay and I have a way of

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.340 
that a cutback okay and I have a way of
measuring<00:02:27.490> it<00:02:27.790> I<00:02:27.910> know<00:02:28.090> exactly<00:02:28.240> how<00:02:28.870> far<00:02:29.140> that

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
measuring it I know exactly how far that

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.740 
measuring it I know exactly how far that
is<00:02:29.410> but<00:02:30.130> what<00:02:30.280> I'm<00:02:30.430> trying<00:02:30.640> to<00:02:30.820> do<00:02:31.030> is<00:02:31.300> make<00:02:31.570> the

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
is but what I'm trying to do is make the

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:37.110 
is but what I'm trying to do is make the
defenders<00:02:32.460> all<00:02:33.840> contain<00:02:34.840> it<00:02:35.050> and<00:02:35.940> keep<00:02:36.940> the

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
defenders all contain it and keep the

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.050 
defenders all contain it and keep the
spacing<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:37.960> same<00:02:38.260> as<00:02:38.530> where<00:02:38.950> they<00:02:39.220> started

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
spacing the same as where they started

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.180 
spacing the same as where they started
now<00:02:40.570> that<00:02:40.810> is<00:02:40.990> hard<00:02:41.260> on<00:02:41.410> defense<00:02:41.590> I<00:02:41.920> don't<00:02:42.070> give

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
now that is hard on defense I don't give

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.130 
now that is hard on defense I don't give
a<00:02:42.310> what<00:02:42.640> they<00:02:42.790> tell<00:02:43.030> you<00:02:43.210> that's<00:02:43.660> hard<00:02:43.990> to

coming back to those guys back there
okay<00:02:54.820> so<00:02:55.360> for<00:02:55.600> instance<00:02:55.960> this<00:02:56.110> guy<00:02:56.290> was

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
okay so for instance this guy was

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.070 
okay so for instance this guy was
playing<00:02:56.680> the<00:02:56.920> south<00:02:57.130> side<00:02:57.370> linebacker<00:02:57.640> or

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
playing the south side linebacker or

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.210 
playing the south side linebacker or
defensive<00:02:59.080> in<00:02:59.230> if<00:02:59.350> it's<00:02:59.530> a<00:02:59.620> defensive<00:03:00.100> end

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
defensive in if it's a defensive end

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.030 
defensive in if it's a defensive end
he's<00:03:01.030> taught<00:03:01.360> to<00:03:01.660> keep<00:03:01.840> that<00:03:02.080> ball<00:03:02.410> on<00:03:02.650> his

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.390 
he's taught to keep that ball on his
inside<00:03:03.570> so<00:03:04.570> he's<00:03:04.810> now<00:03:05.050> got<00:03:05.350> to<00:03:05.500> run<00:03:05.710> about<00:03:06.130> four

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:34.450 
you know I also hate practices we
blocking<00:06:33.259> them<00:06:33.349> every<00:06:33.680> time<00:06:33.860> they<00:06:34.039> throw<00:06:34.219> it's

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:34.460 
blocking them every time they throw it's

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:43.899 
blocking them every time they throw it's
when<00:06:34.580> we<00:06:34.699> block<00:06:34.909> in<00:06:35.060> the<00:06:35.120> best<00:06:42.669> but<00:06:43.669> it's<00:06:43.789> just

00:06:43.899 --> 00:06:43.909 
when we block in the best but it's just

00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:45.640 
when we block in the best but it's just
like<00:06:44.150> each<00:06:44.300> the<00:06:44.479> technique<00:06:44.930> here<00:06:45.110> he<00:06:45.259> got<00:06:45.440> his

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:45.650 
like each the technique here he got his

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:47.860 
like each the technique here he got his
head<00:06:45.800> play<00:06:46.009> side<00:06:46.310> he's<00:06:47.150> working<00:06:47.509> getting<00:06:47.690> his

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:47.870 
head play side he's working getting his

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:49.779 
head play side he's working getting his
head<00:06:48.020> play<00:06:48.229> side<00:06:48.500> and<00:06:48.770> let<00:06:48.949> the<00:06:48.979> lane<00:06:49.219> opens<00:06:49.610> up

00:06:49.779 --> 00:06:49.789 
head play side and let the lane opens up

00:06:49.789 --> 00:06:51.700 
head play side and let the lane opens up
so<00:06:50.000> it<00:06:50.389> looks<00:06:50.419> like<00:06:50.690> a<00:06:50.780> cutback<00:06:51.259> but<00:06:51.469> he<00:06:51.530> says

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:51.710 
so it looks like a cutback but he says

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:53.680 
so it looks like a cutback but he says
go<00:06:51.830> north<00:06:52.069> or<00:06:52.219> south<00:06:52.490> yeah<00:06:52.940> you<00:06:53.180> think<00:06:53.389> has<00:06:53.659> a

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:53.690 
go north or south yeah you think has a

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:56.050 
go north or south yeah you think has a
comeback<00:06:54.259> look

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:56.060 
comeback look

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.900 
comeback look
where<00:06:56.240> this<00:06:56.419> like<00:06:56.660> that<00:06:57.139> but<00:06:58.040> the<00:06:58.610> thing<00:06:58.880> is

00:06:58.900 --> 00:06:58.910 
where this like that but the thing is

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:01.770 
where this like that but the thing is
that<00:06:59.720> we're<00:06:59.900> here<00:07:00.080> about<00:07:00.200> seven<00:07:00.740> yards<00:07:00.860> and

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:01.780 
that we're here about seven yards and

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:04.659 
that we're here about seven yards and
you<00:07:02.780> look<00:07:02.960> where<00:07:03.200> the<00:07:03.350> Titans<00:07:03.770> started<00:07:04.250> take

00:07:04.659 --> 00:07:04.669 
you look where the Titans started take

00:07:04.669 --> 00:07:06.280 
you look where the Titans started take
it<00:07:04.820> back<00:07:04.970> and<00:07:05.210> this<00:07:05.270> is<00:07:05.480> how<00:07:05.600> I<00:07:05.630> tried<00:07:05.990> to<00:07:06.110> teach
