the<00:01:14.600> D<00:01:14.780> flat

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:25.719 

go<00:01:22.939> down<00:01:23.090> a<00:01:23.119> half<00:01:23.299> step<00:01:23.450> to<00:01:23.840> my<00:01:24.020> C<00:01:24.229> chord<00:01:24.700> with<00:01:25.700> a

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
go down a half step to my C chord with a

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:35.109 
go down a half step to my C chord with a
7<00:01:26.180> 3<00:01:26.960> 4<00:01:27.140> 5<00:01:27.500> 6<00:01:27.829> 7
