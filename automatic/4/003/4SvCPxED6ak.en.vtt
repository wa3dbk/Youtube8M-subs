00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:52.760 
and a few things that I've noticed so

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.710 
and a few things that I've noticed so
far<00:01:52.790> is<00:01:53.300> the<00:01:53.570> the<00:01:54.560> glazed<00:01:54.950> pots<00:01:55.430> have<00:01:56.030> the<00:01:56.479> most

far is the the glazed pots have the most

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:05.380 
far is the the glazed pots have the most
purity<00:01:57.350> of<00:01:57.380> tones<00:01:57.710> like<00:01:58.640> I<00:02:03.340> think<00:02:04.340> I'm<00:02:04.729> going

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
purity of tones like I think I'm going

purity of tones like I think I'm going
to<00:02:05.479> try<00:02:05.690> to<00:02:05.750> find<00:02:06.140> a<00:02:06.320> nice<00:02:06.500> little<00:02:06.890> scale<00:02:07.400> I

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
to try to find a nice little scale I

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.279 
to try to find a nice little scale I
don't<00:02:07.729> really<00:02:07.850> care<00:02:08.209> about<00:02:08.240> what<00:02:08.509> the<00:02:08.869> pitches

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
don't really care about what the pitches

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.590 
don't really care about what the pitches
are<00:02:09.470> but<00:02:09.740> I<00:02:09.770> want<00:02:10.009> the<00:02:10.100> relationship<00:02:10.600> between

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.500 
Jersey Symphony and now I'm at last year
and<00:03:17.829> starting<00:03:18.829> with<00:03:18.920> the<00:03:19.100> water<00:03:19.370> concerto<00:03:20.329> and

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
and starting with the water concerto and

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.240 
and starting with the water concerto and
also<00:03:20.930> everything<00:03:21.320> that's<00:03:21.590> been<00:03:21.680> inspired<00:03:22.100> by

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
also everything that's been inspired by

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.140 
also everything that's been inspired by
that<00:03:22.519> element<00:03:23.320> when<00:03:24.320> we<00:03:24.440> can<00:03:24.590> present<00:03:25.070> kind<00:03:26.060> of

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
that element when we can present kind of

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.360 
that element when we can present kind of
these<00:03:26.560> almost<00:03:27.560> poorer<00:03:28.600> rustic<00:03:30.370> instruments

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
these almost poorer rustic instruments

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.710 
these almost poorer rustic instruments
on<00:03:32.209> a<00:03:32.269> stage<00:03:32.660> with<00:03:32.989> a<00:03:33.019> really<00:03:33.290> fine<00:03:33.440> Orchestra

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
on a stage with a really fine Orchestra

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.740 
on a stage with a really fine Orchestra
it<00:03:35.230> just<00:03:35.470> starts<00:03:35.710> to<00:03:35.800> ask<00:03:35.980> questions<00:03:36.940> to<00:03:37.720> the

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
it just starts to ask questions to the

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.510 
it just starts to ask questions to the
audience<00:03:37.900> so<00:03:38.560> I<00:03:38.590> feel<00:03:38.800> with<00:03:38.920> all<00:03:38.950> these<00:03:39.250> pieces

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:39.520 
audience so I feel with all these pieces

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.360 
audience so I feel with all these pieces
and<00:03:39.850> working<00:03:40.300> with<00:03:40.480> kind<00:03:40.660> of<00:03:40.750> basic<00:03:41.380> elements

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
and working with kind of basic elements

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.260 
and working with kind of basic elements
and<00:03:42.730> the<00:03:42.850> idea<00:03:43.270> of<00:03:43.360> that<00:03:44.940> just<00:03:45.940> brings<00:03:46.120> people

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:46.270 
and the idea of that just brings people

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.850 
and the idea of that just brings people
back<00:03:46.420> to<00:03:46.990> a<00:03:47.760> quieter<00:03:48.760> place<00:03:49.270> a<00:03:49.860> less

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 
back to a quieter place a less

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:56.260 
back to a quieter place a less
distracting<00:03:51.520> place

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:56.270 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:08.330 

you

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.400 

you
