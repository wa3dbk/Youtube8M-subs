there and like keep the graph going but
but<00:00:45.329> I<00:00:45.770> haven't<00:00:46.770> grabbed<00:00:47.160> out<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.430> that<00:00:47.550> is<00:00:47.640> a

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
but I haven't grabbed out of that is a

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.130 
but I haven't grabbed out of that is a
polar<00:00:47.969> throw<00:00:48.270> so<00:00:48.510> we<00:00:48.629> might<00:00:48.809> have<00:00:48.930> turned<00:00:49.020> a

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
polar throw so we might have turned a

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.810 
polar throw so we might have turned a
fourth<00:00:49.410> zone<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.860> then<00:00:49.950> it's<00:00:50.100> that<00:00:50.430> backward

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
fourth zone and then it's that backward

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.430 
fourth zone and then it's that backward
you<00:00:50.940> might<00:00:51.090> have<00:00:51.180> just<00:00:51.300> questioned<00:00:51.989> some<00:00:52.199> cod

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
you might have just questioned some cod
