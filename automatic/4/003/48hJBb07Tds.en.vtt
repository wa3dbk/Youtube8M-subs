00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.759

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:24.909
 take care of 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:26.500
 first look for my hair I fasten 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.030
 I bite a skirt , you can too 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.530
 Besides just my hair fix 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.690
 without elastic 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.860
 because i am so tall but now gesture 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.799
 iran elastic it is actually one 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.180
 hair band I like products from hannah 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:40.539
 to clean and change face 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.069
 look after the cooking in my evening 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:44.140
 routine i am not paid by hannah 

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:47.110
 I am in treatment so I have 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.940
 only because Hannah products were 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.110
 negotiating the wishes of a product 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.649
 from hannah 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.649
 euro lotion 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:57.940
 apply the cream and while that whole 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.619
 In the evening, I brush my teeth 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.380
 must also happen I must always 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:04.539
 will power all useful information 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:08.440
 now electric per pot 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:11.260
 the spools connected last night and the 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.760
 final step attracted a set that you are looking for 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.079
 and then my skin delivery is done and 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.519
 they are quite products but I have 

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:18.630
 therefore no easy skin and for me 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:18.630
 this became the finest 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.780
 then I got around I can pretty well 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:28.750
 doubt or what i offered i choose now 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:31.170
 for group sweater and a sample then make 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.850
 I my bed or 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.250
 it also the important drops back 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.780
 you can air yourself and put it all 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.780
 neat again 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:43.110
 tidy a laptop on it 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.850
 kiss and shake the little one 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.780
 there are pillows with about one more 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.400
 to make it cozy 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.590
 when I go to sleep, they always throw on 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:55.380
 the side but it is much nicer 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:57.420
 so for makeup I go to my kart 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.390
 evening sitting with the movie stars lights 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.800
 and I'm going to apply my makeup I'm going 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.300

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.040
 I also have my foundation , for example 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.810

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.730
 also my my daily makeup that there 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.380
 I would look around at left 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.180
 quietly view a cube and 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.930
 I discuss everything clearly and 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.930
 expanded by 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.140

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.240
 I think that is really super beautiful and smells 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.410
 very delicious to chocolate and 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.830

 I apply top and bottom best lead 

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:11.350
 layers can be quite firm on it 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.350
 for me 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.120

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:44.760

 not dry shampoo in especially for volume 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.850
 necessarily because it is bold or dirty but it 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:05.710
 just makes my hair a little 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:08.760
 voluminous a bit lighter and you find 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.760
 it's just our best 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:15.699

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.289

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:19.780

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:27.030
 ready then I grab some water I drink 

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:29.229
