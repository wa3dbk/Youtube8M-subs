00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:03.269 
then if I want so here's the expression

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:05.420 
then if I want so here's the expression
and<00:03:03.659> what<00:03:03.840> am<00:03:03.930> i<00:03:03.989> doing<00:03:04.290> each<00:03:04.409> time<00:03:04.680> yes<00:03:05.250> you

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
and what am i doing each time yes you

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.920 
and what am i doing each time yes you
could<00:03:05.549> say<00:03:05.579> you're<00:03:05.939> adding<00:03:06.389> that's<00:03:07.079> not<00:03:07.230> five

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
could say you're adding that's not five

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.599 
could say you're adding that's not five
you<00:03:09.930> can<00:03:10.079> say<00:03:10.199> you're<00:03:10.349> adding<00:03:10.709> to<00:03:10.889> 50<00:03:11.219> each<00:03:11.400> one

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
you can say you're adding to 50 each one

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:14.330 
you can say you're adding to 50 each one
right<00:03:11.819> you<00:03:12.750> can<00:03:12.900> also<00:03:13.139> say<00:03:13.620> you're

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
right you can also say you're

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.059 
right you can also say you're
multiplying<00:03:15.409> one<00:03:16.409> time<00:03:16.620> you're<00:03:16.829> multiplying

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
multiplying one time you're multiplying

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.110 
multiplying one time you're multiplying
by<00:03:17.750> 250<00:03:18.750> to<00:03:18.840> get<00:03:18.930> to<00:03:19.049> each<00:03:19.109> one<00:03:19.319> let's<00:03:19.859> look<00:03:19.980> at

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
by 250 to get to each one let's look at

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.059 
by 250 to get to each one let's look at
one<00:03:21.120> times<00:03:21.419> 250<00:03:21.930> gives<00:03:22.139> you<00:03:22.260> two<00:03:22.500> fifty-two

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
one times 250 gives you two fifty-two

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:26.179 
one times 250 gives you two fifty-two
times<00:03:23.699> 250<00:03:24.329> gives<00:03:24.569> you<00:03:24.659> five<00:03:24.900> three<00:03:25.680> times<00:03:25.949> two

00:03:26.179 --> 00:03:26.189 
times 250 gives you five three times two

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:29.959 
times 250 gives you five three times two
7250<00:03:27.150> gives<00:03:27.329> you<00:03:27.389> 750<00:03:28.019> and<00:03:28.230> four<00:03:28.980> times<00:03:29.459> 250

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:29.969 
7250 gives you 750 and four times 250

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:31.490 
7250 gives you 750 and four times 250
gives<00:03:30.150> you<00:03:30.239> ten<00:03:30.510> so<00:03:31.049> what<00:03:31.319> you're<00:03:31.470> really

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
gives you ten so what you're really

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.610 
gives you ten so what you're really
doing<00:03:31.709> is<00:03:31.979> you're<00:03:32.009> multiplying<00:03:32.549> by<00:03:33.620> you're

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
doing is you're multiplying by you're

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:35.780 
doing is you're multiplying by you're
multiplying<00:03:34.919> by<00:03:35.220> the<00:03:35.280> number<00:03:35.370> that<00:03:35.669> you

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
multiplying by the number that you

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.849 
multiplying by the number that you
you're<00:03:36.629> multiplying<00:03:36.870> by<00:03:37.079> how<00:03:37.290> many<00:03:37.349> hardcover

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
you're multiplying by how many hardcover

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:40.189 
you're multiplying by how many hardcover
books<00:03:38.129> you<00:03:38.250> have<00:03:38.430> to<00:03:38.699> get<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.269> total<00:03:39.599> cost<00:03:39.840> so

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:40.199 
books you have to get the total cost so

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:42.920 
books you have to get the total cost so
an<00:03:40.859> expression<00:03:41.549> to<00:03:41.819> write<00:03:42.030> this<00:03:42.269> would<00:03:42.750> say

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
an expression to write this would say

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.409 
an expression to write this would say
this<00:03:43.530> is<00:03:43.709> always<00:03:43.949> changing<00:03:44.430> and<00:03:44.939> well<00:03:45.120> then<00:03:45.209> so

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:45.419 
this is always changing and well then so

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:46.819 
this is always changing and well then so
is<00:03:45.540> this<00:03:45.720> but<00:03:45.989> we<00:03:46.109> know<00:03:46.259> at<00:03:46.409> least<00:03:46.439> what<00:03:46.709> the

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
is this but we know at least what the

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:48.499 
is this but we know at least what the
cost<00:03:47.040> is<00:03:47.250> we<00:03:47.639> don't<00:03:47.819> know<00:03:47.970> how<00:03:48.180> many<00:03:48.329> books

00:03:48.499 --> 00:03:48.509 
cost is we don't know how many books

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:50.300 
cost is we don't know how many books
he's<00:03:48.689> gonna<00:03:48.810> sell<00:03:49.109> so<00:03:49.620> I'm<00:03:49.799> saying<00:03:50.069> it's

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
he's gonna sell so I'm saying it's

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.089 
he's gonna sell so I'm saying it's
always<00:03:50.489> gonna<00:03:50.729> be<00:03:50.879> the<00:03:51.030> cost<00:03:51.859> multiplied<00:03:52.859> by

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 
always gonna be the cost multiplied by

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:55.030 
always gonna be the cost multiplied by
how<00:03:53.609> many<00:03:53.819> you<00:03:53.909> have<00:03:54.090> cuz<00:03:54.389> this<00:03:54.449> is<00:03:54.599> really

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
how many you have cuz this is really

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:07.470 
how many you have cuz this is really
good<00:03:56.040> 50<00:03:57.290> 250<00:03:59.780> 250

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.260 

that<00:04:08.080> makes<00:04:08.230> sense<00:04:08.530> 250<00:04:09.010> times<00:04:09.129> 1<00:04:09.520> equals<00:04:09.700> 250

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.270 
that makes sense 250 times 1 equals 250

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.300 
that makes sense 250 times 1 equals 250
250<00:04:10.690> times<00:04:10.810> 2<00:04:11.080> so<00:04:11.560> this<00:04:11.680> is<00:04:11.830> always<00:04:12.040> it's

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
250 times 2 so this is always it's

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:13.530 
250 times 2 so this is always it's
multiplication<00:04:12.610> well<00:04:13.030> this<00:04:13.180> is<00:04:13.330> always

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
multiplication well this is always

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.420 
multiplication well this is always
changing<00:04:13.989> and<00:04:14.080> looking<00:04:14.680> I<00:04:14.800> don't<00:04:14.860> know<00:04:15.220> how

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
changing and looking I don't know how

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.580 
changing and looking I don't know how
many<00:04:15.489> I<00:04:15.760> have<00:04:16.030> so<00:04:16.480> I'm<00:04:16.570> gonna<00:04:16.690> say<00:04:16.930> 250<00:04:19.169> times<00:04:20.169> H

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
many I have so I'm gonna say 250 times H
