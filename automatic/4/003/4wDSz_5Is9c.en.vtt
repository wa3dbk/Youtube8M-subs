the<00:00:19.340> number<00:00:19.610> one<00:00:19.759> maintenance<00:00:20.180> problem<00:00:20.570> is

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720 
the number one maintenance problem is

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.569 
the number one maintenance problem is
for<00:00:20.960> RV<00:00:21.290> owners<00:00:21.650> my<00:00:21.829> response<00:00:22.279> would<00:00:22.520> be

00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:22.579 
for RV owners my response would be

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:24.999 
for RV owners my response would be
batteries<00:00:23.210> there<00:00:23.810> are<00:00:23.960> lots<00:00:24.259> of<00:00:24.439> reasons<00:00:24.649> for

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:25.009 
batteries there are lots of reasons for

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:27.280 
batteries there are lots of reasons for
this<00:00:25.160> like<00:00:25.520> under<00:00:25.939> charged<00:00:26.390> and<00:00:26.660> over<00:00:27.020> charged

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:27.290 
this like under charged and over charged

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.040 
this like under charged and over charged
batteries<00:00:27.980> but<00:00:28.520> the<00:00:28.669> real<00:00:28.910> culprit<00:00:29.599> is<00:00:29.750> the

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
batteries but the real culprit is the

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.409 
batteries but the real culprit is the
battery<00:00:30.500> discharging<00:00:31.279> while<00:00:31.430> the<00:00:31.579> RV<00:00:31.939> sits<00:00:32.270> in
