00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.859
 so welcome to a small person 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.950
 tutorial on how to get a body warrior in 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.380
 Medium 2 correct sketch how to get the 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.599
 skill points distributed and how to 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.519
 the skill points distributed in the 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:20.939
 character status points quite simple 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:23.699
 thing you have to do first for the status 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:27.900
 You always have to have ten more grip 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:30.330
 as tepee that is if you are 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:34.860
 anyway only on and the first as high as 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.940
 the rest of defense and mp could 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.710
 Now forget that does not need him 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.010
 as a warrior that needs that first 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.079
 could if so stuck until you 61 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.289
 has not been on that at all 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:49.980
 so mine is always ten times more 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:55.260
 attack as tepee that means 20 attack 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:57.600
 he had to attack 10 to 30, being 20.40 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.579
 Attack 30 db and so on 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:04.939
 so this must indeed times always be beautiful that 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:09.900
 attacking more than tepee 35 is attacking 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:13.170
 25 dp 69 39 simply attacking with 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.150
 the crafts just me 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.700
 So my solid warriors are not here 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.939
 wonder why not even around 1170 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.490
 risky is not good that's all right 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.040
 easy 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.510
 it just had to be set when 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.310
 So you start playing first 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.950
 Imagine 1 fight except woman 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.410
 jump on you on 1 and shit 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.340
 So I let get away had faster 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.810
 your first m 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.190
 the first applies also in hearted to 17 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.630
 not until 17 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:47.760
 when it plays high above at 70 to be 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.260
 Master goes he must be the old woman 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.030
 I think that's exactly what 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.270
 attitude to old woman and leave your 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.040
 skill points once all goes away 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.470
 but unfortunately only up to level 30 does 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.020
 It also vorlebe 30 there also needs him 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:05.130
 be at least 430 so if I'm level 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:09.179
 21 , 22 people should also at least one 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:12.950
 be it masters then it will happen too 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:15.480
 like skin is but if you want a 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.610
 want to be tv receiver so a player 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.530
 versus monster so if you have good pvm 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.690
 want to be that means against monster 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:26.190
 wants to fight then makes it hard 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:28.170
 high that's the whirl here because that 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.270
 is for pvm if you but against others 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.120
 players want to play rather so pvp 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.489
 player versus player then power struggle 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.239
 and there starts coffee and top 17 too 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:41.100
 raise and do that on gm if it does 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:43.590
 on 70 umspringt it does not matter which one 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.540
 craft if a window to 70 70 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.050
 jumps to level 30 could become one 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.940
 Action 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:53.310
 after that you have to be please itemshop 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:55.320
 use or use a book tied it 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.760
 forget german that forget knows 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.500
 not if I have a goal and where I believe 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.180
 do not look in the warehouse for a moment 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.860
 maybe the once had a moment 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.670
 then it can check out once again shows that a 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.520
 finished books 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.560
 thus risk making the ability 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:11.170
 and I look, unfortunately I have just 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.990
 no goal in the camp but if you once 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.630
 you then that is done must always 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:19.720
 not yet resolved otherwise jumps 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:22.120
 That's exactly what you see here with me 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.800
 75 the fifth craft only to three 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.630
 hectares malweise I go to five 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.930
 because I was so stupid and I think so 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:32.440
 in the forest the craft was too late 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.820
 it does not make me jump that well 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.500
 Hope he helped there and we 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.190
 See us when lies on the left 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.190
 once again then bit
