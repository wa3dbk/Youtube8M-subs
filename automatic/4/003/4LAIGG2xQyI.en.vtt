to<00:00:32.879> be<00:00:32.970> too<00:00:33.210> much<00:00:33.360> of<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.629> focus<00:00:34.019> I<00:00:34.170> use<00:00:34.710> it<00:00:34.890> as

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
to be too much of the focus I use it as

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.430 
to be too much of the focus I use it as
like<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.489> means<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.970> an<00:00:36.030> end<00:00:36.150> and<00:00:36.420> for<00:00:36.720> me<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:36.870> very

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
like a means to an end and for me a very

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.470 
like a means to an end and for me a very
important<00:00:37.890> thing<00:00:38.070> is<00:00:38.280> uh<00:00:38.309> is<00:00:38.699> thematics<00:00:39.269> just

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
important thing is uh is thematics just

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.869 
important thing is uh is thematics just
keeping<00:00:39.780> themes<00:00:40.080> going<00:00:40.470> I<00:00:40.769> like<00:00:41.190> songs<00:00:41.580> to

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
keeping themes going I like songs to

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.880 
keeping themes going I like songs to
sound<00:00:42.120> like<00:00:42.300> they<00:00:42.540> have<00:00:42.570> you<00:00:43.110> know<00:00:43.140> riffs<00:00:43.710> that

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
sound like they have you know riffs that

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.619 
sound like they have you know riffs that
logically<00:00:44.460> fit<00:00:44.699> together<00:00:45.059> or<00:00:45.150> like<00:00:45.449> they

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
logically fit together or like they

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.450 
logically fit together or like they
belong<00:00:45.989> there<00:00:46.229> like<00:00:46.500> they<00:00:46.710> resolve<00:00:47.280> each

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
belong there like they resolve each

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.610 
belong there like they resolve each
other<00:00:47.699> and<00:00:49.129> being<00:00:50.129> not<00:00:50.549> so<00:00:50.850> much<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.030> fan<00:00:51.330> of

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
other and being not so much a fan of

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.530 
other and being not so much a fan of
repetition<00:00:52.620> I<00:00:52.739> try<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.010> find<00:00:53.280> sort<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:53.940> ways<00:00:54.269> to

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:54.540 
repetition I try to find sort of ways to

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.350 
repetition I try to find sort of ways to
bring<00:00:54.900> them<00:00:54.989> back<00:00:55.110> with<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.409> twist<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:55.890> know

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
bring them back with the twist you know

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.079 
bring them back with the twist you know
but<00:00:57.360> I<00:00:57.390> do<00:00:57.510> like<00:00:57.839> to<00:00:58.019> sort<00:00:58.290> of<00:00:58.549> make<00:00:59.549> little<00:00:59.879> you

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:00.089 
but I do like to sort of make little you

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:01.729 
but I do like to sort of make little you
know<00:01:00.180> shout<00:01:00.540> outs<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.930> certain<00:01:01.350> riffs<00:01:01.589> that

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
know shout outs to certain riffs that

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.770 
know shout outs to certain riffs that
were<00:01:01.949> like<00:01:02.190> earlier<00:01:02.549> in<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.760> song<00:01:02.970> just<00:01:03.659> so

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
were like earlier in the song just so

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.810 
were like earlier in the song just so
that<00:01:03.930> like<00:01:04.170> when<00:01:04.320> they<00:01:04.409> come<00:01:04.440> back<00:01:04.820> you're

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
that like when they come back you're

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.340 
that like when they come back you're
like<00:01:05.940> oh<00:01:06.060> I've<00:01:06.240> heard<00:01:06.869> that<00:01:06.990> before

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
like oh I've heard that before

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.380 
like oh I've heard that before
you<00:01:07.740> know<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:08.159> feel<00:01:08.610> like<00:01:08.729> that's<00:01:08.850> kind<00:01:09.119> of<00:01:09.180> fun

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
you know I feel like that's kind of fun

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.870 
you know I feel like that's kind of fun
and<00:01:09.930> it's<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.920> way<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.100> not<00:01:11.310> have<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.580> write<00:01:11.729> so

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
and it's a way to not have to write so

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
and it's a way to not have to write so
many<00:01:12.000> riffs<00:01:12.299> you<00:01:12.479> know<00:01:12.920> but<00:01:13.920> um<00:01:14.630> what<00:01:15.630> I<00:01:15.659> wanted

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
many riffs you know but um what I wanted

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.680 
many riffs you know but um what I wanted
to<00:01:16.020> touch<00:01:16.140> on<00:01:16.320> with<00:01:16.590> this<00:01:16.710> one<00:01:16.979> riff

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
to touch on with this one riff

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.330 
to touch on with this one riff
apart<00:01:18.690> from<00:01:18.780> bringing<00:01:19.050> a<00:01:19.200> theme<00:01:19.590> from<00:01:20.040> earlier

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
apart from bringing a theme from earlier

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.010 
apart from bringing a theme from earlier
on<00:01:20.490> is<00:01:20.700> just<00:01:21.450> kind<00:01:21.600> of<00:01:21.630> a<00:01:21.720> cool<00:01:21.900> little

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
on is just kind of a cool little

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.870 
on is just kind of a cool little
technique<00:01:22.500> since<00:01:23.010> I<00:01:23.160> like<00:01:23.310> tapping<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.700> lot

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
technique since I like tapping a lot

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.430 
technique since I like tapping a lot
like<00:01:24.090> I've<00:01:24.540> found<00:01:24.780> ways<00:01:25.050> to<00:01:25.200> sort<00:01:25.350> of

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.440 
like I've found ways to sort of

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.380 
like I've found ways to sort of
integrate<00:01:25.620> it<00:01:25.950> into<00:01:26.310> like<00:01:26.550> other<00:01:26.910> techniques

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
integrate it into like other techniques

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.240 
integrate it into like other techniques
and<00:01:27.810> one<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:28.050> these<00:01:28.140> one<00:01:28.620> of<00:01:28.650> these<00:01:28.800> ones<00:01:29.070> would

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
and one of these one of these ones would

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.070 
and one of these one of these ones would
be<00:01:29.570> sort<00:01:30.570> of<00:01:30.720> tapping<00:01:31.320> over<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.860> chord<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:33.080> if

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
be sort of tapping over a chord and if

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.540 
be sort of tapping over a chord and if
you<00:01:34.200> just<00:01:34.350> really<00:01:34.620> just<00:01:34.770> think<00:01:35.010> of<00:01:35.160> you<00:01:35.430> know

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
you just really just think of you know

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.130 
you just really just think of you know
like<00:01:35.940> when<00:01:36.090> you're<00:01:36.180> tapping<00:01:36.420> normally<00:01:36.990> you

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
like when you're tapping normally you

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.920 
like when you're tapping normally you
have<00:01:37.170> like<00:01:37.530> these<00:01:37.680> open<00:01:38.490> notes<00:01:38.730> which<00:01:39.060> don't

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
have like these open notes which don't

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.320 
have like these open notes which don't
really<00:01:40.140> sound<00:01:40.860> really<00:01:41.670> good<00:01:41.910> you<00:01:42.180> know<00:01:42.300> just

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
really sound really good you know just

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.240 
really sound really good you know just
on<00:01:42.690> their<00:01:42.840> own<00:01:42.870> so<00:01:43.140> if<00:01:43.380> you<00:01:43.650> use<00:01:43.740> your<00:01:43.920> hand<00:01:44.130> as

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
good and you're just sort of doing that

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.920 
good and you're just sort of doing that
same<00:04:14.299> technique<00:04:14.720> down<00:04:15.140> the<00:04:15.350> string<00:04:15.620> so<00:04:16.930> then

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
same technique down the string so then

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.509 
same technique down the string so then
you're<00:04:18.109> catching<00:04:18.530> it<00:04:18.650> here<00:04:18.859> while<00:04:19.130> this<00:04:19.370> is
