00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
but also for the region so how do we

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.980 
but also for the region so how do we

first we grade the site after that we

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.030 
first we grade the site after that we
build<00:03:29.900> what's<00:03:30.050> called<00:03:30.260> a<00:03:30.350> composite<00:03:30.890> liner
