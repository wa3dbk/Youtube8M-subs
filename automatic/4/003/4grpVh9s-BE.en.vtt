00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
Trey Canard in the last few weeks I kind

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.330 
Trey Canard in the last few weeks I kind
of<00:00:12.719> think<00:00:12.809> about<00:00:12.900> it<00:00:13.139> what's<00:00:13.530> right<00:00:13.860> with<00:00:14.099> Trey

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
of think about it what's right with Trey

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.950 
of think about it what's right with Trey
Canard<00:00:14.670> I<00:00:14.790> mean<00:00:14.910> where<00:00:15.030> do<00:00:15.120> you<00:00:15.210> fall<00:00:15.480> on<00:00:15.540> that

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
Canard I mean where do you fall on that

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.900 
Canard I mean where do you fall on that
aspect<00:00:16.529> positive<00:00:17.100> or<00:00:17.190> negative<00:00:17.340> by<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.670> last

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
aspect positive or negative by the last

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.060 
aspect positive or negative by the last
few<00:00:18.090> races<00:00:18.240> I<00:00:18.690> think<00:00:19.109> you<00:00:19.199> can<00:00:19.350> take<00:00:19.529> it<00:00:19.710> as<00:00:19.800> a

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
few races I think you can take it as a

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.910 
few races I think you can take it as a
negative<00:00:20.369> you<00:00:20.760> know<00:00:20.789> but<00:00:21.210> i<00:00:21.480> think<00:00:21.750> you<00:00:22.230> know

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
negative you know but i think you know

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.650 
negative you know but i think you know
in<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.369> whole<00:00:23.699> grand<00:00:24.029> scheme<00:00:24.119> of<00:00:24.330> things<00:00:24.449> you

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
in the whole grand scheme of things you

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.420 
in the whole grand scheme of things you
gotta<00:00:24.810> look<00:00:24.930> at<00:00:25.080> it<00:00:25.109> as<00:00:25.199> a<00:00:25.289> positive<00:00:25.470> i<00:00:25.980> think

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
gotta look at it as a positive i think

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.160 
gotta look at it as a positive i think
you<00:00:27.029> know<00:00:27.119> people<00:00:27.150> tend<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:27.599> forget<00:00:27.689> that<00:00:28.109> i

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
you know people tend to forget that i

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.200 
you know people tend to forget that i
missed<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.710> whole<00:00:28.890> year<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.490> half<00:00:29.609> of<00:00:29.730> racing

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
missed a whole year and a half of racing

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.060 
missed a whole year and a half of racing
and<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.510> that<00:00:31.260> didn't<00:00:31.529> come<00:00:31.619> back<00:00:31.769> overnight

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
gonna go see where I stand and it was a

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.509 
gonna go see where I stand and it was a
great<00:01:02.489> night<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:03.890> it<00:01:04.890> was<00:01:05.010> what<00:01:05.129> kind<00:01:05.309> of<00:01:05.339> hard

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
great night and it was what kind of hard

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.490 
great night and it was what kind of hard
to<00:01:05.580> follow<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:06.030> up<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.479> know<00:01:06.630> just<00:01:07.049> coming

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
to follow that up you know just coming

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.560 
to follow that up you know just coming
right<00:01:07.619> back<00:01:07.770> in<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.070> series<00:01:08.310> but<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:08.880> mean

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
right back in the series but I mean

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.000 
right back in the series but I mean
that's<00:01:09.659> okay<00:01:10.020> i<00:01:10.049> think<00:01:10.380> that<00:01:10.619> was<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.770> good<00:01:10.950> race

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
that's okay i think that was a good race

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.149 
that's okay i think that was a good race
and<00:01:11.760> i<00:01:11.939> think<00:01:12.299> that<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:13.470> fact<00:01:13.680> that<00:01:13.830> there<00:01:14.010> was

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
and i think that the fact that there was

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.850 
and i think that the fact that there was
no<00:01:14.340> expectations<00:01:14.939> helped<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.210> lot<00:01:15.360> but<00:01:15.860> you

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
no expectations helped a lot but you

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.560 
no expectations helped a lot but you
know<00:01:16.950> like<00:01:17.159> i<00:01:17.280> said<00:01:17.460> it's<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:18.030> it's<00:01:18.330> an<00:01:18.450> ongoing

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
know like i said it's a it's an ongoing

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.780 
know like i said it's a it's an ongoing
process<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.799> i<00:01:19.860> got<00:01:20.070> to<00:01:20.100> just<00:01:20.340> keep<00:01:20.520> my<00:01:20.759> head

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790

process and i got to just keep my head
right<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:21.600> not<00:01:22.560> listen<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:22.920> all<00:01:23.070> that<00:01:23.130> the

some fun how do you do that how do you

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.740 
some fun how do you do that how do you
keep<00:01:29.430> your<00:01:29.610> head<00:01:29.790> right<00:01:29.939> who<00:01:30.150> do<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:30.329> lean<00:01:30.570> on

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
keep your head right who do you lean on

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.289 
keep your head right who do you lean on
or<00:01:31.140> what<00:01:31.350> do<00:01:31.470> you<00:01:31.560> fall<00:01:31.799> back<00:01:32.100> on<00:01:32.340> when<00:01:32.579> you're

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
or what do you fall back on when you're

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:34.880 
or what do you fall back on when you're
not<00:01:33.420> having<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.900> exact<00:01:34.229> results<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:34.710> want

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
not having the exact results you want

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.460 
not having the exact results you want
still<00:01:35.100> good<00:01:35.280> results<00:01:35.640> but<00:01:35.960> where<00:01:36.960> do<00:01:37.079> you<00:01:37.110> go

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
still good results but where do you go

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.260 
still good results but where do you go
for<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:37.650> support<00:01:38.070> I<00:01:38.280> think<00:01:38.700> for<00:01:38.880> me<00:01:38.909> it's<00:01:39.150> all

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
for that support I think for me it's all

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.550 
for that support I think for me it's all
about<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:39.780> know<00:01:39.810> where<00:01:40.079> do<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.229> find<00:01:40.380> your

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560

about you know where do you find your
identity<00:01:40.950> you<00:01:41.159> know<00:01:41.280> if<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.549> find<00:01:41.700> your

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
an extra good place so for me finding my

racing<00:01:54.930> is<00:01:55.049> you<00:01:55.290> know<00:01:55.380> in<00:01:55.500> Christ<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.040> I<00:01:56.219> think

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
racing is you know in Christ and I think

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.700 
racing is you know in Christ and I think
that's<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.820> big<00:01:56.969> thing<00:01:57.000> but<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:58.469> know<00:01:58.560> I<00:01:58.619> think

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
that's a big thing but you know I think

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.370 
that's a big thing but you know I think
in<00:01:59.009> all<00:01:59.219> that<00:01:59.430> helps<00:02:00.060> me<00:02:00.149> see<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:00.869> little<00:02:01.259> bit

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
in all that helps me see a little bit

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.859 
in all that helps me see a little bit
even-keeled<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:02.280> where<00:02:02.430> I<00:02:02.460> can<00:02:02.630> not<00:02:03.630> have
