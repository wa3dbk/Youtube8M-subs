it is I highly suggest eliminating
carbohydrates<00:00:44.190> when<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.370> diet<00:00:44.580> for<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:45.180> short

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:45.900 
carbohydrates when you diet for a short

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.140 
carbohydrates when you diet for a short
period<00:00:46.140> of<00:00:46.170> time<00:00:46.230> maybe<00:00:46.890> two<00:00:47.129> weeks<00:00:47.309> you<00:00:48.030> can

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:48.150 
period of time maybe two weeks you can

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:49.400 
period of time maybe two weeks you can
also<00:00:48.269> eliminate<00:00:48.449> them<00:00:48.750> completely<00:00:48.780> but

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
also eliminate them completely but

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.229 
also eliminate them completely but
eliminate<00:00:49.799> certainly<00:00:50.370> high<00:00:51.059> glycemic

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
eliminate certainly high glycemic

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.570 
eliminate certainly high glycemic
carbohydrates<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:52.320> can<00:00:52.799> stick<00:00:53.010> with<00:00:53.040> a<00:00:53.190> few

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:53.580 
carbohydrates you can stick with a few

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.160 
carbohydrates you can stick with a few
starches<00:00:54.150> but<00:00:54.360> primarily<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:54.870> want<00:00:54.900> even

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
starches but primarily you want even

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.020 
starches but primarily you want even
eliminate<00:00:55.500> starches<00:00:55.979> depending<00:00:56.610> on<00:00:56.699> how<00:00:56.790> bad

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
eliminate starches depending on how bad

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.410 
eliminate starches depending on how bad
you<00:00:57.239> are

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
you are

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.380 
you are
as<00:00:57.659> far<00:00:57.870> as<00:00:57.900> insulin<00:00:58.559> resistance<00:00:59.339> maybe<00:01:00.239> if

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
as far as insulin resistance maybe if

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.759 
as far as insulin resistance maybe if
you're<00:01:00.510> over<00:01:00.780> 20%<00:01:01.170> body<00:01:01.440> fat

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:01.769 
you're over 20% body fat

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:03.829 
you're over 20% body fat
I've<00:01:01.949> eliminated<00:01:02.159> it<00:01:02.489> completely<00:01:03.000> for<00:01:03.299> two<00:01:03.750> to

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:03.839 
I've eliminated it completely for two to

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:06.350 
I've eliminated it completely for two to
three<00:01:03.869> weeks<00:01:04.049> if<00:01:05.040> you're<00:01:05.190> just<00:01:05.339> over<00:01:05.610> 12%<00:01:05.970> but

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
three weeks if you're just over 12% but

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.730 
three weeks if you're just over 12% but
you<00:01:06.479> find<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:06.869> if<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.140> eat<00:01:07.260> carbs<00:01:07.590> you

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
you find that if you eat carbs you

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.710 
you find that if you eat carbs you
really<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:08.130> really<00:01:08.159> resist<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:08.760> so<00:01:08.970> you<00:01:09.600> get

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
really you really resist it so you get

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.390 
really you really resist it so you get
fat<00:01:09.930> for<00:01:10.200> meeting<00:01:10.380> carbs<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:10.979> may<00:01:11.100> take<00:01:11.280> it

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
fat for meeting carbs you may take it

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.560 
fat for meeting carbs you may take it
out<00:01:11.490> for<00:01:11.640> just<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.880> couple<00:01:12.000> weeks<00:01:12.240> or<00:01:12.540> even

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
out for just a couple weeks or even

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.359 
out for just a couple weeks or even
cycling<00:01:13.229> it<00:01:13.350> cycling<00:01:13.740> carbohydrate<00:01:14.220> is<00:01:14.280> a

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
cycling it cycling carbohydrate is a

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.500 
cycling it cycling carbohydrate is a
great<00:01:14.580> way<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.729> optimize<00:01:15.030> instant

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:15.510 
great way to optimize instant

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.179 
great way to optimize instant
sensitivity<00:01:16.080> so<00:01:16.619> for<00:01:16.770> those<00:01:16.860> of<00:01:17.010> you<00:01:17.100> that

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
sensitivity so for those of you that

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.320 
sensitivity so for those of you that
don't<00:01:17.310> know<00:01:17.430> obviously<00:01:17.790> most<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.180> do

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
don't know obviously most of you do

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.539 
don't know obviously most of you do
cycling<00:01:18.930> simply<00:01:19.380> means<00:01:19.560> varying<00:01:20.520> your

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
cycling simply means varying your

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.760 
cycling simply means varying your
amounts<00:01:21.090> so<00:01:21.690> there<00:01:21.900> may<00:01:21.990> be<00:01:22.020> three<00:01:22.350> days<00:01:22.530> in<00:01:22.710> a

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
amounts so there may be three days in a

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.440 
amounts so there may be three days in a
row<00:01:22.950> where<00:01:23.130> I<00:01:23.160> go<00:01:23.340> very<00:01:23.580> low<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.030> then<00:01:24.150> one<00:01:24.330> day

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
row where I go very low and then one day

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.510 
row where I go very low and then one day
I<00:01:24.480> go<00:01:24.720> high<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.200> then<00:01:25.770> or<00:01:26.100> one<00:01:26.250> day<00:01:26.340> I'll<00:01:26.430> go

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
I go high and then or one day I'll go

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.980 
I go high and then or one day I'll go
medium<00:01:26.790> then<00:01:26.970> one<00:01:27.120> day<00:01:27.240> high<00:01:27.360> then<00:01:27.600> low<00:01:27.630> back

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
medium then one day high then low back

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.780 
medium then one day high then low back
low<00:01:28.200> again<00:01:28.530> it<00:01:28.890> depends<00:01:29.370> on<00:01:29.430> my<00:01:29.580> specific

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
low again it depends on my specific

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.760 
low again it depends on my specific
goals<00:01:30.210> at<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.480> time<00:01:30.750> on<00:01:31.080> my<00:01:31.410> training

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
goals at the time on my training

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.420 
goals at the time on my training
intensity<00:01:32.510> and<00:01:33.510> on<00:01:33.630> how<00:01:33.860> much<00:01:34.860> body<00:01:35.040> fat<00:01:35.160> I

have or you have
so<00:01:36.570> those<00:01:36.720> are<00:01:36.840> your<00:01:36.900> considerations<00:01:37.530> when<00:01:37.680> we

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
so those are your considerations when we

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.620 
so those are your considerations when we
look<00:01:38.010> at<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.190> insulin<00:01:38.460> sensitivity<00:01:38.850> as<00:01:39.390> far

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
look at the insulin sensitivity as far

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:40.940 
look at the insulin sensitivity as far
as<00:01:39.750> supplements<00:01:40.140> go

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
as supplements go

as supplements go
my<00:01:41.280> favorite<00:01:41.670> is<00:01:41.790> simply<00:01:42.060> cinnamon<00:01:42.450> it's<00:01:42.750> so
