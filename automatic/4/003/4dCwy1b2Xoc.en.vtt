it's<00:00:00.750> time<00:00:00.989> for<00:00:01.020> another<00:00:01.260> sudden<00:00:01.949> schematic

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
it's time for another sudden schematic

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.730 
it's time for another sudden schematic
and<00:00:02.939> you<00:00:03.510> guys<00:00:03.689> might<00:00:03.929> recall<00:00:04.230> that<00:00:04.290> I<00:00:04.470> did<00:00:04.710> a

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
and you guys might recall that I did a

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.309 
and you guys might recall that I did a
wee<00:00:05.130> look<00:00:05.310> inside<00:00:05.819> took<00:00:06.390> a<00:00:06.450> look<00:00:06.660> inside<00:00:07.080> some

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
wee look inside took a look inside some

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.310 
wee look inside took a look inside some
m4<00:00:08.010> student<00:00:08.309> tape<00:00:08.490> LED<00:00:08.910> lamps<00:00:09.240> and<00:00:09.510> I<00:00:10.139> got

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
m4 student tape LED lamps and I got

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.600 
m4 student tape LED lamps and I got
another<00:00:10.710> one<00:00:10.889> from<00:00:11.099> a<00:00:11.160> different<00:00:11.190> supplier

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
another one from a different supplier

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.459 
another one from a different supplier
which<00:00:12.059> had<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.360> Bennett<00:00:12.660> cat<00:00:12.809> bass<00:00:13.049> instead

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
which had the Bennett cat bass instead

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.530 
which had the Bennett cat bass instead
of<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:13.679> Edison<00:00:14.040> screw<00:00:14.219> and<00:00:14.730> when<00:00:15.240> it<00:00:15.360> plugged

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
of the Edison screw and when it plugged

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:16.760 
of the Edison screw and when it plugged
it<00:00:15.660> in<00:00:15.750> I<00:00:15.870> thought<00:00:16.049> this<00:00:16.230> is<00:00:16.410> just<00:00:16.500> going<00:00:16.710> to

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
it in I thought this is just going to

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:17.960 
it in I thought this is just going to
have<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:16.949> same<00:00:17.130> as<00:00:17.250> Socrates<00:00:17.430> gonna<00:00:17.820> have

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
have the same as Socrates gonna have

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.769 
have the same as Socrates gonna have
that<00:00:18.090> slight<00:00:18.449> shimmer<00:00:18.779> to<00:00:19.080> it<00:00:19.109> and<00:00:20.779> the

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
that slight shimmer to it and the

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.509 
that slight shimmer to it and the
diffused<00:00:22.140> LEDs<00:00:22.500> but<00:00:22.680> this<00:00:22.830> one<00:00:22.980> projected

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
diffused LEDs but this one projected

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.120 
diffused LEDs but this one projected
quite<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.760> hot<00:00:24.750> spot<00:00:25.140> of<00:00:25.320> light<00:00:25.500> onto<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.920> end

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
quite a hot spot of light onto the end

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.070 
quite a hot spot of light onto the end
and<00:00:26.490> that's<00:00:26.820> because<00:00:27.180> it's<00:00:27.330> got<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.869> clear

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
and that's because it's got the clear

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.490 
and that's because it's got the clear
LEDs<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:29.090> it's<00:00:30.090> not<00:00:30.330> got<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.599> circuitry<00:00:31.230> that

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
LEDs and it's not got the circuitry that

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.290 
LEDs and it's not got the circuitry that
the<00:00:31.560> other<00:00:31.710> one<00:00:31.830> had<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.160> other<00:00:32.309> one<00:00:32.460> cheap

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
the other one had the other one cheap

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.979 
the other one had the other one cheap
toad<00:00:33.600> it<00:00:34.020> used<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.469> capacitor<00:00:35.420> in<00:00:36.420> series<00:00:36.750> the

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
point 2 micro fired at 50 volt so that's

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
plus that's - that's AC AC then they go

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.700 
plus that's - that's AC AC then they go
through<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.420> LEDs<00:01:34.790> but<00:01:35.790> in<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:37.170> save<00:01:37.380> space<00:01:37.650> in

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
summer here but it really is just a case

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.350 
summer here but it really is just a case
that<00:01:58.380> they<00:01:58.500> because<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.579> LEDs<00:01:59.909> now<00:02:00.119> suck

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
that they because the LEDs now suck

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.179 
that they because the LEDs now suck
around<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.750> edge<00:02:00.899> there<00:02:01.140> just<00:02:01.320> dukedom<00:02:01.979> off

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
around the edge there just dukedom off

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.219 
around the edge there just dukedom off
two<00:02:02.670> of<00:02:02.759> the<00:02:02.880> terminals<00:02:03.299> went<00:02:03.869> through<00:02:04.110> the

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
two of the terminals went through the

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.770 
two of the terminals went through the
resistor<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:04.619> then<00:02:04.829> kept<00:02:05.100> going<00:02:05.310> through<00:02:05.520> the

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
resistor and then kept going through the

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.630 
resistor and then kept going through the
LEDs<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:06.810> that<00:02:07.110> achieves<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.590> same<00:02:07.619> thing<00:02:08.099> so

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
LEDs and that achieves the same thing so

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.550 
LEDs and that achieves the same thing so
it's<00:02:09.560> interesting<00:02:11.959> minimalist

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
it's interesting minimalist

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.710 
it's interesting minimalist
and<00:02:13.680> slightly<00:02:14.610> less<00:02:14.880> similar<00:02:15.300> than<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.600> other

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
and slightly less similar than the other

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.770 
and slightly less similar than the other
ones<00:02:15.930> but<00:02:16.200> having<00:02:17.190> said<00:02:17.459> that<00:02:17.520> the<00:02:18.330> factors

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
ones but having said that the factors

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.380 
ones but having said that the factors
kept<00:02:18.959> the<00:02:19.110> focused<00:02:19.830> LEDs<00:02:20.280> makes<00:02:20.940> it<00:02:21.120> worse

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
kept the focused LEDs makes it worse

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.490 
kept the focused LEDs makes it worse
than<00:02:21.569> the<00:02:21.690> other<00:02:21.810> ones<00:02:21.990> because<00:02:22.319> the<00:02:22.380> other

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
than the other ones because the other

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.050 
than the other ones because the other
ones<00:02:22.709> spread<00:02:23.069> the<00:02:23.190> light<00:02:23.340> very<00:02:23.580> even<00:02:23.970> their

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
ones spread the light very even their

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.640 
ones spread the light very even their
own<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.330> globe<00:02:24.510> which<00:02:24.720> also<00:02:25.080> avoided<00:02:25.470> the

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630

other than through the camera or maybe
just<00:02:30.090> out<00:02:30.239> in<00:02:30.510> peripheral<00:02:30.810> vision<00:02:31.230> this<00:02:31.800> one

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
just out in peripheral vision this one

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.670

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
just does have it doesn't have an even

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.590 
just does have it doesn't have an even
