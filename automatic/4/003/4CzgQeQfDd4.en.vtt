the oblique eyebrow so that means that

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.250 
the oblique eyebrow so that means that
the<00:01:04.410> brow<00:01:04.620> just<00:01:04.860> goes<00:01:05.280> up<00:01:05.550> and<00:01:05.970> out<00:01:06.630> so<00:01:07.230> a

on<00:02:57.090> the<00:02:57.360> top<00:02:57.750> of<00:02:57.900> my<00:02:58.080> lid<00:03:01.700> Lana<00:03:02.700> does<00:03:03.180> have

liner but again it's a bit slapdash and

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.860 
liner but again it's a bit slapdash and
it's<00:03:07.770> a<00:03:07.920> bit<00:03:08.070> softer<00:03:08.490> than<00:03:08.640> a<00:03:08.880> liquid<00:03:09.420> or<00:03:09.510> a<00:03:09.600> gel
