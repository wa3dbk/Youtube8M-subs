and<00:00:34.030> again<00:00:34.390> the<00:00:34.539> beauty<00:00:34.840> about<00:00:34.930> this<00:00:35.260> range

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:35.590 
and again the beauty about this range

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.970 
and again the beauty about this range
same<00:00:36.219> as<00:00:36.370> the<00:00:36.629> seven<00:00:37.629> eight<00:00:37.870> and<00:00:38.109> nine<00:00:38.170> meter

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:38.980 
same as the seven eight and nine meter

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.549 
same as the seven eight and nine meter
we<00:00:39.069> do<00:00:39.159> minami<00:00:39.730> to<00:00:39.909> this<00:00:40.059> this<00:00:40.690> one<00:00:40.899> as<00:00:41.019> well<00:00:41.170> we

00:00:41.549 --> 00:00:41.559 
we do minami to this this one as well we

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:43.259 
we do minami to this this one as well we
do<00:00:41.679> anything<00:00:42.069> longer<00:00:42.339> than<00:00:42.550> nine<00:00:42.729> two<00:00:42.940> before

00:00:43.259 --> 00:00:43.269 
do anything longer than nine two before

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:46.110 
do anything longer than nine two before
because<00:00:43.870> after<00:00:44.379> that<00:00:44.530> length<00:00:44.769> it<00:00:45.640> starts

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
because after that length it starts

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.119 
because after that length it starts
becoming<00:00:46.420> a<00:00:46.600> little<00:00:46.749> bit<00:00:46.949> unmanageable<00:00:47.949> but

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:48.129 
becoming a little bit unmanageable but

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:50.000 
becoming a little bit unmanageable but
as<00:00:48.280> you<00:00:48.399> can<00:00:48.550> see<00:00:48.609> that<00:00:49.329> one<00:00:49.539> is<00:00:49.659> completely

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
as you can see that one is completely

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:01.659 
twist it and turn it that one goes back

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:05.189

but again another little tip when you

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:32.550 
but again another little tip when you
put<00:01:31.119> in<00:01:31.210> your<00:01:31.240> next<00:01:31.630> section<00:01:31.840> into<00:01:32.200> this<00:01:32.320> one

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
put in your next section into this one

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.160 
put in your next section into this one
don't<00:01:33.070> trap<00:01:33.490> it<00:01:33.729> make<00:01:34.210> sure<00:01:34.329> you<00:01:34.570> put<00:01:34.780> the<00:01:34.869> next

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
don't trap it make sure you put the next

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.490 
don't trap it make sure you put the next
section<00:01:35.560> over<00:01:36.070> that<00:01:36.390> or<00:01:37.390> otherwise<00:01:37.869> you'll<00:01:38.409> be

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
section over that or otherwise you'll be

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.870 
section over that or otherwise you'll be
trapping<00:01:38.829> it<00:01:38.920> against<00:01:39.159> the<00:01:39.340> side<00:01:39.549> of<00:01:39.759> the

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
trapping it against the side of the

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.149 
trapping it against the side of the
walls<00:01:40.090> as<00:01:40.359> you<00:01:40.390> can<00:01:40.630> see<00:01:40.840> and<00:01:41.200> you<00:01:41.710> don't<00:01:41.950> want

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 
walls as you can see and you don't want

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:43.950 
walls as you can see and you don't want
that<00:01:42.219> so<00:01:42.609> you<00:01:42.640> make<00:01:42.880> sure<00:01:43.119> that<00:01:43.329> the<00:01:43.539> actual

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
that so you make sure that the actual

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.709 
that so you make sure that the actual
section<00:01:44.710> goes<00:01:44.950> over<00:01:45.280> the<00:01:45.369> top<00:01:45.399> of<00:01:45.729> the<00:01:45.850> line<00:01:46.000> so

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:46.719 
section goes over the top of the line so

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:48.389 
section goes over the top of the line so
it<00:01:46.840> doesn't<00:01:47.109> trap<00:01:47.320> it<00:01:47.499> and<00:01:47.679> damage<00:01:47.920> the<00:01:48.189> poor

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:48.399 
it doesn't trap it and damage the poor

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:51.029 
it doesn't trap it and damage the poor
well<00:01:49.119> they<00:01:49.240> get<00:01:49.390> very<00:01:49.689> very<00:01:49.960> hard<00:01:50.499> whirring
