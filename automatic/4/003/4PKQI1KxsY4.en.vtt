00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
for around 1 hour I'm going to divide

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:09.050 
for around 1 hour I'm going to divide
this<00:03:03.860> the<00:03:04.860> small<00:03:05.130> portion<00:03:06.769> to<00:03:07.769> make<00:03:08.060> cheese

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.160 

and<00:03:36.570> now<00:03:36.810> I'm<00:03:36.990> going<00:03:37.170> to<00:03:37.320> shave<00:03:37.980> them<00:03:38.220> into<00:03:38.460> non

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
by thinning the edges with my fingers

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.950 
by thinning the edges with my fingers
like<00:03:42.450> this<00:03:43.340> so<00:03:44.340> like<00:03:44.550> this<00:03:44.700> I'm<00:03:45.090> going<00:03:45.270> to<00:03:45.360> thin

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:45.960 
like this so like this I'm going to thin

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.800 
like this so like this I'm going to thin
all<00:03:46.170> the<00:03:46.500> edges<00:03:46.740> and<00:03:47.030> spread<00:03:48.030> it<00:03:48.150> out<00:03:48.270> into<00:03:48.600> a

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
all the edges and spread it out into a

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.860 
all the edges and spread it out into a
flat<00:03:49.050> disc<00:03:50.390> and<00:03:51.390> then<00:03:51.840> I'm<00:03:52.050> going<00:03:52.260> to<00:03:52.350> just

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
flat disc and then I'm going to just

00:03:53.870 --> 00:04:00.620 
flat disc and then I'm going to just
stretch<00:03:54.870> this<00:03:58.070> stretch<00:03:59.070> it<00:03:59.310> from<00:03:59.490> one<00:03:59.700> side<00:03:59.730> to

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
stretch this stretch it from one side to

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.040 
stretch this stretch it from one side to
get<00:04:00.750> a<00:04:00.810> shape<00:04:01.050> of<00:04:01.230> naan<00:04:01.620> like<00:04:01.860> this

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.050 
get a shape of naan like this

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:05.990 
get a shape of naan like this
next<00:04:04.050> I'm<00:04:04.140> going<00:04:04.290> to<00:04:04.350> grease<00:04:04.620> the<00:04:05.340> baking<00:04:05.490> tray

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
next I'm going to grease the baking tray

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:12.270 
next I'm going to grease the baking tray
with<00:04:06.770> some<00:04:07.770> butter

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:18.880 

place<00:04:13.280> this<00:04:13.490> non<00:04:13.760> over<00:04:14.330> it<00:04:17.440> now<00:04:18.440> the<00:04:18.500> second

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:18.890 
place this non over it now the second

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:21.160 
place this non over it now the second
one<00:04:18.980> I<00:04:19.190> am<00:04:19.910> going<00:04:20.060> to<00:04:20.150> show<00:04:20.299> it<00:04:20.450> with<00:04:20.780> a<00:04:20.810> rolling

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:21.170 
one I am going to show it with a rolling

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:23.620 
one I am going to show it with a rolling
pin<00:04:21.230> so<00:04:21.590> you<00:04:21.920> need<00:04:22.070> to<00:04:22.280> roll<00:04:22.460> this<00:04:22.700> in<00:04:22.970> a<00:04:23.420> round

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
pin so you need to roll this in a round

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:30.740 
pin so you need to roll this in a round
shape

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.740 

and<00:04:31.750> then<00:04:32.050> you<00:04:32.920> can<00:04:33.100> stress<00:04:33.550> this<00:04:33.820> from<00:04:34.540> one

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
and then you can stress this from one

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:42.690 
and then you can stress this from one
end<00:04:37.290> like<00:04:38.290> this<00:04:38.500> to<00:04:39.430> give<00:04:39.610> a<00:04:39.640> shape<00:04:39.880> of<00:04:40.060> none<00:04:41.700> so

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 
end like this to give a shape of none so

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.030 
end like this to give a shape of none so
this<00:04:42.910> also<00:04:43.120> goes<00:04:43.450> on<00:04:43.720> the<00:04:44.050> baking<00:04:44.380> tray<00:04:44.500> make

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
this also goes on the baking tray make

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.490 
this also goes on the baking tray make
sure<00:04:45.220> that<00:04:45.430> the<00:04:45.610> edges<00:04:46.030> are<00:04:46.210> thin<00:04:46.720> and<00:04:46.960> now<00:04:47.410> I'm

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
sure that the edges are thin and now I'm

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.080 
sure that the edges are thin and now I'm
going<00:04:47.680> to<00:04:47.800> sprinkle<00:04:48.130> the<00:04:48.370> remaining<00:04:48.610> cheese

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090
