the motion controls I personally

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.149 
the motion controls I personally
preferred<00:01:45.869> using<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.290> stick<00:01:46.530> but<00:01:46.860> it's<00:01:47.009> nice

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
but it caters for both you can also

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.319 
but it caters for both you can also
increase<00:01:49.860> or<00:01:50.100> decrease<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.460> sensitivity<00:01:51.210> to

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
increase or decrease the sensitivity to

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
really great system but these are just

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.690

it<00:03:34.549> doesn't<00:03:34.849> have<00:03:35.000> many<00:03:35.209> stages<00:03:35.569> as<00:03:35.989> fun<00:03:36.949> as<00:03:37.099> it

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
it doesn't have many stages as fun as it

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.780 
it doesn't have many stages as fun as it

tad<00:03:41.180> repetitive<00:03:41.449> and<00:03:42.169> that's<00:03:42.470> a<00:03:42.650> problem

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:42.859 
tad repetitive and that's a problem

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:45.159 
tad repetitive and that's a problem
until<00:03:43.849> they<00:03:44.120> have<00:03:44.419> stated<00:03:44.750> but<00:03:45.019> they're

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:45.169 
until they have stated but they're

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:47.469 
until they have stated but they're
adding<00:03:45.439> more<00:03:45.590> maps<00:03:45.829> in<00:03:46.099> the<00:03:46.129> near<00:03:46.340> future<00:03:46.479> but

adding more maps in the near future but

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:49.689 
adding more maps in the near future but
I<00:03:47.540> don't<00:03:47.959> really<00:03:48.379> see<00:03:48.620> why<00:03:48.650> they<00:03:49.280> can't<00:03:49.549> be

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:49.699 
I don't really see why they can't be

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
Alice multiplayer genuinely does hook

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.050 
Alice multiplayer genuinely does hook
you<00:04:32.229> but<00:04:32.919> it's<00:04:33.160> currently<00:04:33.580> lacking<00:04:33.819> in

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
you but it's currently lacking in

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.730 
you but it's currently lacking in
multiple<00:04:34.419> stages<00:04:34.660> which<00:04:34.990> makes<00:04:35.319> it<00:04:35.440> tab

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
multiple stages which makes it tab

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.770 
multiple stages which makes it tab
repetitive<00:04:36.280> at<00:04:36.370> times<00:04:36.580> I<00:04:36.849> completely

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
repetitive at times I completely

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.240 
repetitive at times I completely
recommend<00:04:38.199> buying<00:04:38.349> it<00:04:38.590> but<00:04:38.830> just<00:04:39.099> be<00:04:39.220> patient

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
recommend buying it but just be patient

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.070 
recommend buying it but just be patient
for<00:04:39.759> them<00:04:40.000> to<00:04:40.150> add<00:04:40.240> some<00:04:40.419> more<00:04:40.509> stages<00:04:40.780> because

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
for them to add some more stages because

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.180 
for them to add some more stages because
I<00:04:41.259> think<00:04:41.319> it's<00:04:41.590> going<00:04:41.680> to<00:04:41.740> make<00:04:41.860> the<00:04:42.009> game<00:04:42.160> a

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
I think it's going to make the game a

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:50.790 
I think it's going to make the game a
lot<00:04:42.370> better<00:04:49.380> thank<00:04:50.380> you<00:04:50.470> everyone<00:04:50.710> for
