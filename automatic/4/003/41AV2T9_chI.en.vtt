already know that we are giving way to
the<00:00:34.890> right<00:00:35.190> so<00:00:35.760> obviously<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:36.480> must<00:00:36.630> be<00:00:36.809> clear

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
the right so obviously it must be clear

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.920 
the right so obviously it must be clear
in<00:00:37.350> that<00:00:37.380> direction<00:00:37.860> before<00:00:38.219> we<00:00:38.610> move<00:00:38.790> off<00:00:39.000> but

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
in that direction before we move off but

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.360 
in that direction before we move off but
for<00:00:40.110> this<00:00:40.230> clip<00:00:40.559> I<00:00:40.710> want<00:00:40.860> you<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.160> concentrate

for this clip I want you to concentrate

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.490 
for this clip I want you to concentrate
on<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.030> direction<00:00:42.360> we<00:00:42.690> will<00:00:42.870> need<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.290> take

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
on the direction we will need to take

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.950 
on the direction we will need to take
the<00:00:43.829> position<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.180> roundabout<00:00:45.750> will

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
the position of the roundabout will

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.690 
the position of the roundabout will
force<00:00:46.260> us<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.530> move<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.160> left

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
force us to move to the left

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.729 
force us to move to the left
a<00:00:47.789> quick<00:00:48.390> check<00:00:48.629> in<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.899> mirror<00:00:49.050> will<00:00:49.320> confirm

a quick check in the mirror will confirm

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.380 
a quick check in the mirror will confirm
that<00:00:49.950> any<00:00:50.100> vehicles<00:00:50.670> will<00:00:50.879> have<00:00:50.910> moved<00:00:51.210> away

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
that any vehicles will have moved away

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.479 
that any vehicles will have moved away
to<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.899> left<00:00:52.079> as<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.559> road<00:00:52.770> markings<00:00:53.219> told

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
to the left as the road markings told

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.150 
to the left as the road markings told
them<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.820> do<00:00:53.969> so<00:00:54.750> when<00:00:54.960> we<00:00:55.140> move<00:00:55.350> out<00:00:55.620> we<00:00:55.949> should

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
them to do so when we move out we should

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.130 
them to do so when we move out we should
keep<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.670> left<00:00:56.910> of<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.300> roundabout<00:00:57.690> and

give<00:01:07.470> way<00:01:07.680> lines<00:01:08.010> so<00:01:08.340> we<00:01:08.490> have<00:01:08.640> reached<00:01:08.880> the

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:09.120 
give way lines so we have reached the

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.270 
give way lines so we have reached the
second<00:01:09.540> roundabout<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.410> need<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.890> look<00:01:11.040> to

same double mini roundabout from a
different<00:01:27.600> direction<00:01:27.750> this<00:01:28.740> time<00:01:29.040> we<00:01:29.250> will<00:01:29.400> go

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.550 
different direction this time we will go

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:30.590 
different direction this time we will go
straight<00:01:29.850> across

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
straight across

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.290

notice<00:01:31.380> how<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.590> signpost<00:01:32.280> tells<00:01:32.640> us<00:01:32.910> we<00:01:33.090> will

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:33.300 
notice how the signpost tells us we will

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.300 
notice how the signpost tells us we will
need<00:01:33.480> to<00:01:33.660> use<00:01:33.840> both<00:01:34.140> roundabouts<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.160> go

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
need to use both roundabouts to go

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:45.030 
need to use both roundabouts to go
straight<00:01:35.670> ahead

the<00:01:45.580> road<00:01:45.790> markings<00:01:46.390> confirm<00:01:47.050> we<00:01:47.410> are<00:01:47.440> in<00:01:47.740> the

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
the road markings confirm we are in the

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.980 
the road markings confirm we are in the
correct<00:01:48.160> lane

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.560

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
see there are two give-way lines across

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.630 
see there are two give-way lines across
our<00:01:56.750> path<00:01:57.020> so<00:01:57.710> it<00:01:57.830> must<00:01:58.070> be<00:01:58.130> clear<00:01:58.430> to<00:01:58.610> our

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
our path so it must be clear to our

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.789 
our path so it must be clear to our
right<00:01:59.030> before<00:01:59.420> moving<00:01:59.810> across<00:01:59.990> the<00:02:00.110> first<00:02:00.440> one

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
right before moving across the first one

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:03.130 
right before moving across the first one
and<00:02:01.010> then<00:02:01.610> clear<00:02:01.940> to<00:02:02.119> the<00:02:02.240> right<00:02:02.390> again<00:02:02.840> when

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
and then clear to the right again when

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.990 
and then clear to the right again when
we<00:02:03.290> get<00:02:03.409> to<00:02:03.470> the<00:02:03.680> second<00:02:04.100> one<00:02:04.250> which<00:02:04.490> is<00:02:04.520> just<00:02:04.700> a

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
we get to the second one which is just a

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.690 
we get to the second one which is just a
couple<00:02:05.210> of<00:02:05.360> meters<00:02:05.540> further<00:02:05.990> on<00:02:06.550> here's<00:02:07.550> the

couple of meters further on here's the

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.210 
couple of meters further on here's the
first<00:02:08.030> one<00:02:08.420> we're<00:02:09.110> not<00:02:09.259> concerned<00:02:09.740> about<00:02:09.920> the

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
first one we're not concerned about the

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.250 
first one we're not concerned about the
red<00:02:10.399> car<00:02:10.729> because<00:02:11.120> the<00:02:11.270> road<00:02:11.480> markings<00:02:12.020> tell

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
red car because the road markings tell

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.809 
red car because the road markings tell
us<00:02:12.380> we<00:02:12.530> haven't<00:02:12.860> reached<00:02:13.069> that<00:02:13.340> roundabout

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
us we haven't reached that roundabout

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.870 
us we haven't reached that roundabout
yet<00:02:14.300> he<00:02:15.050> has<00:02:15.260> moved<00:02:15.500> across<00:02:15.830> our<00:02:16.040> path<00:02:16.340> because

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
yet he has moved across our path because

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.880 
yet he has moved across our path because
he<00:02:17.030> knows<00:02:17.300> that<00:02:17.330> even<00:02:17.810> if<00:02:17.989> we<00:02:18.140> had<00:02:18.410> reached<00:02:18.680> the

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
he knows that even if we had reached the

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.190 
he knows that even if we had reached the
second<00:02:19.340> roundabout<00:02:19.700> we<00:02:20.420> should<00:02:20.720> give<00:02:20.930> way<00:02:21.140> to

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
second roundabout we should give way to

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.140 
second roundabout we should give way to
him<00:02:23.410> now<00:02:24.410> we've<00:02:24.680> reached<00:02:24.860> the<00:02:25.069> second<00:02:25.489> one<00:02:25.640> if

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
him now we've reached the second one if

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.970 
him now we've reached the second one if
there's<00:02:26.510> no<00:02:26.690> long<00:02:26.930> coming<00:02:27.170> traffic<00:02:27.500> turning

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
there's no long coming traffic turning

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.790 
there's no long coming traffic turning
right<00:02:28.340> across<00:02:28.640> as<00:02:28.940> we<00:02:29.120> can<00:02:29.330> move<00:02:29.480> out<00:02:29.810> there<00:02:30.680> is

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
right across as we can move out there is

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.680 
right across as we can move out there is
a<00:02:30.830> lot<00:02:31.010> to<00:02:31.070> take<00:02:31.340> in<00:02:31.400> on<00:02:31.700> this<00:02:31.910> video<00:02:32.209> view<00:02:32.600> it

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
a lot to take in on this video view it

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.449 
a lot to take in on this video view it
as<00:02:32.840> many<00:02:33.050> times<00:02:33.320> as<00:02:33.530> you<00:02:33.650> like<00:02:33.800> using<00:02:34.220> the
