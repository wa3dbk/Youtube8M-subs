00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:23.300
 as corners on surfaces in this 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:23.300
 case a few days ago he works 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:34.379
 as a very practical solution although 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.839
 there are these monies that are with a 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:39.059
 rather hard surface and cause and 

00:00:36.839 --> 00:00:41.940
 can determine the inconvenience of 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.640
 they are very thick and the 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.100
 Bastillas can usually hold us 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.589
 and while using a tape 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.840
 flexible that you let yourself work starting 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:55.180
 hard enough in this case 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.360
 we can cut your good in a project of 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.890
 export the size that we need that 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.260
 subsequently making a putty 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.950
 multipurpose as we have here 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:09.570
 we can start to organize our 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.570
 our corner 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.790
 and so we begin 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:57.659
 once the part has dried that 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:02.440
 is the most and what we use to 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:05.050
 install this money then we proceed to 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:08.380
 our second part which is to apply a 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:11.950
 little and apply a second layer is 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:16.840
 possible that more than two should be applied 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:19.860
 layers to give it the finish that the plane 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.860
 need to denver 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.140
 good 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:48.090
 and what is 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.090
 money tape is very very well 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:54.260
