which<00:01:09.580> is<00:01:09.790> really<00:01:10.630> cool<00:01:10.960> so<00:01:11.770> I<00:01:11.830> do<00:01:12.070> close<00:01:12.340> it

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
which is really cool so I do close it

you<00:01:12.880> don't<00:01:13.090> usually<00:01:13.270> get<00:01:13.540> sits<00:01:13.870> with<00:01:14.140> that

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290 
you don't usually get sits with that

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.000 
you don't usually get sits with that
many<00:01:14.500> pieces<00:01:14.740> very<00:01:15.670> heavy<00:01:16.000> box<00:01:16.890> imagine<00:01:17.890> it's

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.010 
many pieces very heavy box imagine it's

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.560 
many pieces very heavy box imagine it's
not<00:01:18.190> filled<00:01:18.460> with<00:01:18.640> air<00:01:18.820> like<00:01:18.850> some<00:01:19.360> of<00:01:19.510> the

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
not filled with air like some of the

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.080 
not filled with air like some of the
larger<00:01:19.900> boxes<00:01:20.290> you<00:01:20.470> you<00:01:20.830> get<00:01:21.010> you<00:01:21.760> get<00:01:21.910> two

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
larger boxes you you get you get two

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.860 
larger boxes you you get you get two
figures<00:01:22.540> and<00:01:22.870> be<00:01:23.380> all<00:01:23.530> important<00:01:24.130> fish<00:01:24.870> so

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:25.870 
figures and be all important fish so

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.440 
figures and be all important fish so
this<00:01:26.110> is<00:01:26.320> a<00:01:26.350> very<00:01:26.830> good-looking<00:01:27.250> sit<00:01:27.910> in<00:01:28.300> the

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
this is a very good-looking sit in the

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.610 
this is a very good-looking sit in the
box<00:01:28.660> here's<00:01:29.230> the<00:01:30.120> top<00:01:31.120> of<00:01:31.150> the<00:01:31.330> box<00:01:31.480> there<00:01:31.840> just

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:32.620 
box here's the top of the box there just

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.130 
box here's the top of the box there just
get<00:01:32.980> this<00:01:33.780> step<00:01:34.780> over<00:01:35.170> it<00:01:35.260> but<00:01:35.440> you<00:01:35.470> can<00:01:35.830> pick

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
get this step over it but you can pick

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:45.750 
get this step over it but you can pick
sometimes<00:01:38.140> you<00:01:38.260> can<00:01:38.440> find<00:01:43.500> all<00:01:44.500> right<00:01:44.700> so<00:01:45.700> you

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:45.760 
sometimes you can find all right so you

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.210 
sometimes you can find all right so you
get<00:01:46.030> a<00:01:46.060> free<00:01:46.750> storage<00:01:47.050> container<00:01:47.500> basically

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
get a free storage container basically

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:54.150 
get a free storage container basically
I'm<00:01:48.580> not<00:01:48.760> technically<00:01:49.210> free<00:01:50.940> show<00:01:51.940> you<00:01:53.160> so

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.160 
I'm not technically free show you so

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.270 
I'm not technically free show you so
very<00:01:54.460> good<00:01:54.730> it<00:01:55.630> is<00:01:55.780> mostly<00:01:56.200> full<00:01:56.590> so<00:01:56.920> that<00:01:57.100> is

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
very good it is mostly full so that is

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.790 
very good it is mostly full so that is
very<00:01:57.910> good<00:01:58.240> so<00:01:58.450> we're<00:01:59.110> going<00:01:59.230> to<00:01:59.290> see<00:01:59.530> what

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
very good so we're going to see what

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.930 
very good so we're going to see what
else

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940

manual<00:02:11.710> shows<00:02:12.710> a<00:02:12.740> few<00:02:13.010> ideas<00:02:13.220> to<00:02:13.700> build<00:02:14.060> I

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
manual shows a few ideas to build I

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.400 
manual shows a few ideas to build I
think<00:02:15.770> i'll<00:02:15.920> build<00:02:16.100> this<00:02:16.340> thing<00:02:16.700> like<00:02:16.970> here

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
think i'll build this thing like here

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:23.350 
think i'll build this thing like here
efficiency<00:02:21.520> all<00:02:22.520> right<00:02:22.700> here's<00:02:22.970> one<00:02:23.150> of<00:02:23.270> the

efficiency all right here's one of the

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.180 
efficiency all right here's one of the
scenes<00:02:23.630> from<00:02:23.870> the<00:02:24.110> middle<00:02:24.380> of<00:02:24.470> the<00:02:24.560> book<00:02:24.710> I

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.750 
in February 2014 and they are retiring
it<00:02:50.870> soon<00:02:51.140> that's<00:02:51.440> what<00:02:51.590> the<00:02:51.710> website<00:02:52.100> says<00:02:52.400> so

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
it soon that's what the website says so

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.880 
it soon that's what the website says so
you<00:02:53.060> can<00:02:53.480> get<00:02:53.570> it<00:02:53.660> for<00:02:53.750> about<00:02:53.870> $32<00:02:54.650> it<00:02:54.770> was

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
you can get it for about $32 it was

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.030 
you can get it for about $32 it was
originally<00:02:55.370> a<00:02:55.660> $45<00:02:56.660> set<00:02:57.170> but<00:02:57.410> I<00:02:57.500> think<00:02:57.710> even<00:02:57.830> at

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
originally a $45 set but I think even at

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.180 
originally a $45 set but I think even at
$45<00:02:58.850> it<00:02:59.060> was<00:02:59.180> a<00:02:59.210> good<00:02:59.450> deal<00:02:59.660> for<00:03:00.470> a<00:03:00.530> duper<00:03:00.890> step

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
$45 it was a good deal for a duper step

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.970 
$45 it was a good deal for a duper step
having<00:03:01.610> this<00:03:01.700> many<00:03:01.940> pieces<00:03:02.260> that<00:03:03.260> we<00:03:03.710> built

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
having this many pieces that we built

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.890 
having this many pieces that we built
this<00:03:04.340> thing<00:03:04.670> here<00:03:05.000> he<00:03:05.209> had<00:03:05.450> the<00:03:05.630> little

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
for the feet to the airplane that was

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.550 
for the feet to the airplane that was
neat<00:03:11.000> and<00:03:11.209> paste<00:03:12.200> it<00:03:12.410> holds<00:03:12.709> the<00:03:13.180> pillar
