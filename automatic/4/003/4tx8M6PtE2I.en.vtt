 from australia europe 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:11.950
 from Brazil or Canada 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.379
 a name recognized as a leader around the world of agricultural aviation 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.949
 or ifc 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.109
 more than 50 years, agricultural aviation professionals rely on the 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:30.109
 aircraft have affected 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:34.420
 they are poorly productive 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.750
 designed with a focus on pilot safety and proven long life 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:48.220
 from the model to pec 4 01 how to make day limit of 500 liters of capacity 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:49.550
 of load 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.450
 up to model firefighting article 8 02 f how torture the lcd three 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.180
 thousand liters of load capacity to air tractor with offers more options of 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.180
 aircraft than any other manufacturer 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:09.320
 as these airplanes have a higher carrying capacity at a significant reduction 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.780
 of the operational cost per age applied 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.490
 equipment other than ground-based aerial spraying equipment are not 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.270
 limited by wet or flooded fields the pork by robbers 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.310
 during the day a woman who produces three times more than a sprayer 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.280
 terrestrial 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.020
 this means lower fuel consumption and environmental pollution 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.190
 without loss by compaction we enter the track of the tires that means 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.190
 higher profit for the producer 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.910
 making it a safe and comfortable 23rd airplane while flying 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.480
 the spacious cabin 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.070
 the pilot has excellent visibility in all directions 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.770
 the distribution of the instruments provides a quick and easy reading 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.640
 a window located on the fire wall allows the pilot to monitor 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.640
 continuously the quantity of product in port 

00:02:18.779 --> 00:02:23.679
 the spacious cabin has the flight control seats positioned aiming 

00:02:23.679 --> 00:02:27.699
 the comfort and safety of the pilot in order to reduce fatigue comes 

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:30.929
 protracted operations 

00:02:30.929 --> 00:02:36.539
 the air-conditioning and thinking so all the turboprop models also helps 

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:39.749
 decrease pilot wear 

00:02:39.749 --> 00:02:42.020
 the air bag km 6 system 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.279
 is item with some reserve aircraft 

00:02:45.279 --> 00:02:50.109
 it helps protect the head from the torso and neck of the pilot in case of 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:52.620
 sudden deceleration of the aircraft 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.150
 and can also be installed on the older models of the company 

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:06.579
 The aerodynamic and harmonic design of the air tractor improves 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:07.480
 fuel 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.640
 light speed improves maneuverability by 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.640
 landing distances that take off 

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:22.479
 the metallic control surfaces have durability - compensating turns 

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:25.479
 improve response of commands 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.540
 wing length allows a wide range of deposition 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.840
 reducing the number of applications and at the same time the overall productivity 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:41.689
 The vehicle marks of the aircraft spray system had 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:45.930
 have been specially designed and positioned to 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.930
 higher quality in the application 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:54.219
 the water bills that by force at the moment give to the surface of 

00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:58.929
 thus providing more climb speed and better control. 

00:03:58.929 --> 00:04:01.529
 of the aircraft 

00:04:01.529 --> 00:04:05.959
 The air tractor has an induction 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:10.549
 increase the airflow to the engine by reducing the internal temperature of the 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:15.040
 this production system increases power while maintaining the same 

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:16.569
 survey 

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:21.049
 uranium than turbines with high productivity and 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.819
 everton aircraft reduces operating cost considerably 

00:04:24.819 --> 00:04:29.699
 because they are considering that a reflector does work of at least two 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:32.270
 aircraft to medium-sized vision 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:37.169
 this means greater profitability and better use of the ideal hours 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:39.120
 of the day for application 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.920
 and in the off-season the aircraft have a tractor with load capacity above 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:45.539
 thousand five hundred kilograms 

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:48.539
 may be used in fire-fighting 

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:55.259
 the landing gear close to being simple reinforced sector and designed to 

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:59.849
 take-offs and landings with heavy loads on paved or unpaved roads. 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:07.990
 pratt and whitney turbines that are installed in all air 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.220
 france is carrying large loads whether we operate in large 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:17.200
 altitudes, reliability and power of its engines is proven 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.860
 the well known turbines pratt and whitney petersen hoist meets all 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:29.590
 performance requirements the operators sought in their aircraft is that the crack 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.069
 in this market 

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:36.629
 an aircraft and the crew is reliable and if you have an excellent 

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:41.719
 after-sales support to air tractor aircraft with a 

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:45.490
 dealers strategically positioned around the world 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.690
 operators with a complete service 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:52.690
 replacement and maintenance 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:01.789
 in opening up we are committed to the continuous improvement of our 

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:02.770
 aircraft 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:06.909
 offering more security value-added productivity 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:12.400
 is why the reopening will be that today's application professionals 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.400
 send morning 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.610
 for sure 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:27.169
 worst option in terms of aviation madrid
