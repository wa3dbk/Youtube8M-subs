 Hello everyone today I would like to show 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.400
 you have such an interesting thing that 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.920
 happened to me when i played cs go 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.920
 I played in the ordinary mode 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.830
 common in mine clearance bombs and 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.960
 10 per 10 people and once when me 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.020
 killed this character who is now on 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.060
 the screen in the incentive I do not have you with my 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.980
 snipers 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.330
 how would all tigers to know that in the ordinary 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.920
 mode camera is transferred as we 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.009
 characters shows me how people 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.559
 who killed me and when I looked at 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.410
 this man kind of noticed behind him 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:41.190
 here it consists silhouette do not know this 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.590
 the air here is his body neck neck but with 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.899
 the eyes of the skull from him like a god like that 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.410
 rounded countries and don't know what it is 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.690
 such in general how would I experience 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.879
 most personally interested i would like to 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.890
 ask you viewers maybe someone 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:01.859
 knows that it is probably worth orac o and 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:03.480
 Either I personally assume that we allow 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.640
 in halloween mode they beat that is 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.220
 some sort of 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:11.580
 feature but not seen quite often 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.880
 VKS playing but this I have not seen and yet 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.790
 maybe it's such a flash drive there 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.770
 Noise-grenades Well I do not know from 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.409
 An ordinary grenade could have come up 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.659
 the effect though hardly because how 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.420
 see these people did not close their eyes that is 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.299
 no flash drive exploded there 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.180
 there is no idea what it is and for now 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:37.290
 you will not give an answer in the comments I will 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:39.810
 take it as something mystical and don't know 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.200
 even what is it what is the spirit there 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.000
 maybe I donâ€™t even know in general 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.240
 comments are very interesting to know 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.560
 quicker what this one is 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.780
 trust no photoshop there is no 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.119
