fantastic<00:01:24.650> thing<00:01:24.950> about<00:01:25.280> the<00:01:25.430> log<00:01:25.580> magic<00:01:26.060> is

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
fantastic thing about the log magic is

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.820 
fantastic thing about the log magic is
that<00:01:26.300> it<00:01:26.570> is<00:01:26.630> brilliant<00:01:27.110> for<00:01:27.440> cutting

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
that it is brilliant for cutting

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.640 
that it is brilliant for cutting
kindling<00:01:28.100> just<00:01:29.030> a<00:01:29.120> great<00:01:29.330> tip<00:01:29.660> and<00:01:29.930> if<00:01:30.350> you<00:01:30.500> put

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:30.650 
kindling just a great tip and if you put

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.740 
kindling just a great tip and if you put
it<00:01:30.740> inside<00:01:30.890> a<00:01:31.100> high<00:01:31.640> profile<00:01:32.120> tire<00:01:32.420> like<00:01:32.720> this

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
it inside a high profile tire like this

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.740 
it inside a high profile tire like this
all<00:01:33.650> you<00:01:33.920> would<00:01:34.160> stays<00:01:34.550> nice<00:01:34.820> and<00:01:35.060> stable<00:01:35.510> and

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
all you would stays nice and stable and

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.240 
all you would stays nice and stable and
you<00:01:35.810> don't<00:01:36.020> need<00:01:36.140> to<00:01:36.200> do<00:01:36.380> any<00:01:36.620> bending<00:01:37.100> or

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
you don't need to do any bending or

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.270 
you don't need to do any bending or
moving<00:01:37.280> about<00:01:37.760> you<00:01:38.570> can<00:01:38.720> just<00:01:38.870> basically

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
moving about you can just basically

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.430 
moving about you can just basically
start<00:01:40.280> off<00:01:40.400> wherever<00:01:40.700> you<00:01:40.910> want<00:01:41.170> just<00:01:42.170> do<00:01:42.320> the

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 
start off wherever you want just do the

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.350 
start off wherever you want just do the
same<00:01:42.650> technique<00:01:42.920> with<00:01:43.400> you<00:01:43.580> then<00:01:43.910> bit<00:01:44.120> the

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
same technique with you then bit the

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.690 
same technique with you then bit the
head<00:01:44.840> of<00:01:44.990> the<00:01:45.080> axe<00:01:45.290> and<00:01:45.950> then<00:01:46.070> move<00:01:46.280> both<00:01:46.460> hands

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
head of the axe and then move both hands

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.110 
head of the axe and then move both hands
to<00:01:46.910> the<00:01:46.940> upper<00:01:47.210> shaft<00:01:47.450> and<00:01:48.140> bang<00:01:48.910> can<00:01:49.910> make

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:50.120 
to the upper shaft and bang can make

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.990 
to the upper shaft and bang can make
tiny<00:01:50.510> little<00:01:50.870> bits<00:01:51.110> of<00:01:51.200> kindling<00:01:51.620> in<00:01:52.000> record

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
tiny little bits of kindling in record

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.470
