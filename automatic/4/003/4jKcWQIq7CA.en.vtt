essentially<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:57.090> connection<00:01:58.020> if<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:58.290> want<00:01:58.469> to

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
essentially a connection if you want to

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.470 
essentially a connection if you want to
say<00:01:58.649> that<00:01:58.829> between<00:01:59.520> each<00:02:00.030> of<00:02:00.540> your<00:02:00.810> pillars

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:03.480 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.420 

now<00:02:04.480> go<00:02:04.840> all<00:02:05.050> the<00:02:05.200> way<00:02:05.230> around<00:02:05.410> so<00:02:06.160> you<00:02:06.250> have

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
now go all the way around so you have

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.000 
now go all the way around so you have
like<00:02:06.760> a<00:02:07.030> ring<00:02:07.720> and<00:02:08.679> then<00:02:08.950> get<00:02:09.220> out<00:02:09.340> your<00:02:09.490> glass

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.010 
like a ring and then get out your glass

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:15.180 
like a ring and then get out your glass
and<00:02:12.010> you<00:02:12.130> can<00:02:12.190> just<00:02:12.460> make<00:02:12.640> a<00:02:12.940> wall<00:02:14.010> and<00:02:15.010> then

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
and you can just make a wall and then

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.680 
and you can just make a wall and then
making<00:02:15.340> sure<00:02:15.610> that<00:02:15.790> you<00:02:15.910> do<00:02:16.030> this<00:02:16.180> between

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
making sure that you do this between

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.280 
making sure that you do this between
each<00:02:17.320> of<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:18.280> pillars<00:02:18.930> okay<00:02:19.930> so<00:02:19.990> now<00:02:20.260> that

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
each of the pillars okay so now that

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.930 
each of the pillars okay so now that
you've<00:02:20.530> done<00:02:20.680> this<00:02:20.950> I'm<00:02:21.280> going<00:02:21.520> to<00:02:21.640> assume

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
you've done this I'm going to assume

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.610 
you've done this I'm going to assume
that<00:02:22.000> you're<00:02:22.209> in<00:02:22.330> survival<00:02:22.780> mode<00:02:22.810> so<00:02:23.500> what

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
that you're in survival mode so what

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.560 
that you're in survival mode so what
you're<00:02:23.800> going<00:02:23.950> to<00:02:23.980> want<00:02:24.130> to<00:02:24.190> do<00:02:24.340> is<00:02:25.120> come<00:02:25.390> down

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
you're going to want to do is come down

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.780 
you're going to want to do is come down
to<00:02:25.780> this<00:02:25.870> little<00:02:26.320> hole<00:02:26.920> that<00:02:27.220> all<00:02:27.400> the<00:02:27.580> water

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
to this little hole that all the water

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.040 
to this little hole that all the water
flows<00:02:28.090> into<00:02:28.770> and<00:02:29.770> doesn't<00:02:30.310> matter<00:02:30.490> but<00:02:30.850> go<00:02:31.060> one

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
flows into and doesn't matter but go one

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.020 
flows into and doesn't matter but go one
block<00:02:32.230> in<00:02:32.500> front<00:02:32.530> anywhere<00:02:33.250> to<00:02:33.610> block<00:02:33.820> your

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
block in front anywhere to block your

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.580 
block in front anywhere to block your
choice<00:02:34.209> but<00:02:34.480> make<00:02:34.630> sure<00:02:34.750> it<00:02:34.900> is<00:02:34.990> not<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:35.170> glass

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
choice but make sure it is not the glass

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.270 
choice but make sure it is not the glass
and<00:02:36.180> just<00:02:37.180> make<00:02:38.310> make<00:02:39.310> another<00:02:40.209> pillar<00:02:40.660> out

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
and just make make another pillar out

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.949 
and just make make another pillar out
like<00:02:42.280> so<00:02:43.350> then<00:02:44.350> take<00:02:44.560> your<00:02:44.680> ladders<00:02:45.100> and<00:02:45.959> place

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
like so then take your ladders and place

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:52.949 
like so then take your ladders and place
it<00:02:47.140> on<00:02:47.230> there<00:02:48.060> now<00:02:49.060> take<00:02:49.300> your<00:02:49.420> glass<00:02:51.959> and

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
it on there now take your glass and

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:57.270 
it on there now take your glass and
place<00:02:53.380> it<00:02:53.560> everywhere<00:02:55.080> except<00:02:56.080> in<00:02:56.560> the<00:02:56.980> middle

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
place it everywhere except in the middle

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.390 
place it everywhere except in the middle
so<00:02:58.239> now<00:02:58.390> you<00:02:58.450> have<00:02:58.780> a<00:02:59.110> hole<00:02:59.410> in<00:02:59.680> the<00:03:00.280> middle

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
so now you have a hole in the middle

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.910 
so now you have a hole in the middle
there<00:03:00.610> for<00:03:00.790> you<00:03:00.880> to<00:03:00.970> get<00:03:01.060> down<00:03:01.209> there<00:03:01.680> and<00:03:02.680> one

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
there for you to get down there and one

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.920 
there for you to get down there and one
more<00:03:03.070> thing<00:03:03.340> destroy<00:03:04.000> one<00:03:04.390> of<00:03:04.420> the<00:03:04.660> glass

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
more thing destroy one of the glass

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.699 
more thing destroy one of the glass
pillar<00:03:06.690> place<00:03:07.690> it<00:03:07.870> replace<00:03:08.290> with<00:03:08.470> the<00:03:08.560> block

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
pillar place it replace with the block

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.930 
pillar place it replace with the block
your<00:03:08.920> choice<00:03:09.360> and<00:03:10.360> then<00:03:10.870> just<00:03:11.610> go<00:03:12.610> all<00:03:12.790> the<00:03:12.910> way

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
your choice and then just go all the way

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:13.729 
your choice and then just go all the way
back<00:03:13.150> up

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
back up

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:18.570 
back up
take<00:03:14.739> out<00:03:14.890> your<00:03:14.920> ladder<00:03:16.530> so<00:03:17.530> then<00:03:17.739> now<00:03:17.920> you<00:03:17.980> can

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
take out your ladder so then now you can

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.020 
take out your ladder so then now you can
leave<00:03:19.090> from<00:03:19.750> the<00:03:19.900> inside<00:03:20.519> just<00:03:21.519> come<00:03:21.880> up<00:03:22.000> here

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
leave from the inside just come up here

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.770 
leave from the inside just come up here
and<00:03:22.510> then<00:03:22.870> run<00:03:23.080> and<00:03:23.260> jump<00:03:23.440> off<00:03:24.660> let's<00:03:25.660> take

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
and then run and jump off let's take

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.190 
and then run and jump off let's take
your<00:03:25.900> ladder<00:03:26.430> and<00:03:27.430> go<00:03:27.610> on<00:03:27.790> each<00:03:28.510> side<00:03:28.900> of<00:03:29.110> the

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
your ladder and go on each side of the

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.580 
your ladder and go on each side of the
pillar<00:03:30.480> on<00:03:31.480> all<00:03:31.720> of<00:03:31.900> them<00:03:31.989> now<00:03:32.290> it<00:03:32.410> doesn't

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
pillar on all of them now it doesn't

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:33.930 
pillar on all of them now it doesn't
have<00:03:32.799> to<00:03:32.980> be<00:03:33.070> on<00:03:33.190> all<00:03:33.340> of<00:03:33.370> them<00:03:33.549> you<00:03:33.730> can<00:03:33.760> you

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
have to be on all of them you can you

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.550 
have to be on all of them you can you
can<00:03:34.150> only<00:03:34.299> do<00:03:34.450> it<00:03:34.540> on<00:03:34.570> one<00:03:34.660> but<00:03:34.989> I<00:03:35.019> just<00:03:35.260> find<00:03:35.380> it

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
can only do it on one but I just find it

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.460 
can only do it on one but I just find it
it's<00:03:35.680> easier<00:03:36.130> if<00:03:36.489> you<00:03:36.910> do<00:03:37.180> it<00:03:37.209> on<00:03:37.510> just<00:03:37.810> one

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:46.800 

first<00:03:41.470> go<00:03:41.650> all<00:03:41.890> the<00:03:42.040> way<00:03:42.070> around<00:03:45.510> until<00:03:46.510> you

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:46.810 
first go all the way around until you

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.410 
first go all the way around until you
have<00:03:47.110> placed<00:03:47.590> all<00:03:47.860> the<00:03:47.890> ladders<00:03:48.160> now<00:03:49.090> from

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
have placed all the ladders now from

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.690 
have placed all the ladders now from
here<00:03:49.780> you<00:03:50.260> are<00:03:50.290> going<00:03:50.709> to<00:03:51.220> need<00:03:51.340> any<00:03:51.519> more

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
here you are going to need any more

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:52.949 
here you are going to need any more
ladders<00:03:51.880> so<00:03:52.150> you<00:03:52.209> can<00:03:52.299> go<00:03:52.390> ahead<00:03:52.480> and<00:03:52.720> put

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:52.959 
ladders so you can go ahead and put

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:53.370 
ladders so you can go ahead and put
those<00:03:53.079> away

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
those away

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:54.979 
those away
all<00:03:53.860> right<00:03:54.040> so<00:03:54.190> now<00:03:54.340> come<00:03:54.489> to<00:03:54.610> your<00:03:54.730> basement

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
all right so now come to your basement

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.890 
all right so now come to your basement
take<00:03:55.989> your<00:03:56.140> glass<00:03:56.440> and<00:03:56.739> then<00:03:57.250> break<00:03:57.579> the<00:03:58.510> three

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
take your glass and then break the three

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.470 
take your glass and then break the three
blocks<00:03:59.230> on<00:04:00.070> all<00:04:00.370> three<00:04:00.579> sides<00:04:00.670> we're<00:04:01.269> just

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
blocks on all three sides we're just

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.069 
blocks on all three sides we're just
basically<00:04:01.810> the<00:04:02.079> bottom<00:04:02.470> of<00:04:02.590> the<00:04:02.650> pillars<00:04:04.079> this

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079 
basically the bottom of the pillars this

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:07.920 
basically the bottom of the pillars this
won't<00:04:05.290> affect<00:04:05.440> anything<00:04:06.360> and<00:04:07.360> you<00:04:07.630> can<00:04:07.780> also

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
won't affect anything and you can also

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.960 
won't affect anything and you can also
do<00:04:08.290> what<00:04:08.440> I'm<00:04:08.530> about<00:04:08.739> to<00:04:08.799> do<00:04:09.130> with<00:04:09.579> the<00:04:09.790> block

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
do what I'm about to do with the block

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.460 
do what I'm about to do with the block
your<00:04:10.180> choice<00:04:10.390> I<00:04:10.510> find<00:04:10.780> it<00:04:10.840> to<00:04:10.930> be<00:04:10.959> easier<00:04:11.349> at

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
your choice I find it to be easier at

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.660 
your choice I find it to be easier at
the<00:04:11.500> glass<00:04:11.770> so<00:04:12.400> you<00:04:12.459> can<00:04:12.580> see<00:04:12.700> what's<00:04:12.849> going<00:04:13.090> on

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
the glass so you can see what's going on

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.030 
the glass so you can see what's going on
so<00:04:14.390> basically<00:04:14.660> replace<00:04:15.230> those<00:04:15.440> pillars<00:04:15.830> with

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 
so basically replace those pillars with

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:27.880 
so basically replace those pillars with
the<00:04:16.160> glass<00:04:19.209> looks<00:04:20.209> like<00:04:20.390> so<00:04:22.630> and<00:04:24.430> then<00:04:26.890> make

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:27.890 
the glass looks like so and then make

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:30.520 
the glass looks like so and then make
sure<00:04:27.920> you<00:04:28.130> just<00:04:28.250> go<00:04:28.430> too<00:04:28.490> high<00:04:29.200> and<00:04:30.200> with<00:04:30.320> all

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
sure you just go too high and with all

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.850 
sure you just go too high and with all
of<00:04:30.680> the<00:04:30.800> blocks<00:04:31.270> and<00:04:32.410> then<00:04:33.410> you<00:04:33.530> leave<00:04:33.710> the

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
of the blocks and then you leave the

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.310 
of the blocks and then you leave the
very<00:04:34.040> bottom<00:04:34.460> block<00:04:34.730> except<00:04:35.240> exposed<00:04:35.900> for

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
very bottom block except exposed for

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:44.950 
very bottom block except exposed for
water<00:04:36.830> to<00:04:37.040> come<00:04:37.070> through<00:04:43.780> now<00:04:44.780> you're

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
water to come through now you're

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.470 
water to come through now you're
probably<00:04:45.140> wondering<00:04:45.740> why<00:04:46.070> why<00:04:46.970> mine<00:04:47.210> so<00:04:47.419> in

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:47.480 
probably wondering why why mine so in

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.360 
probably wondering why why mine so in
this<00:04:47.660> year's<00:04:47.930> apply<00:04:48.140> all<00:04:48.290> flooding<00:04:48.650> in<00:04:48.800> its

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
this year's apply all flooding in its

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.930 
this year's apply all flooding in its
that<00:04:49.730> I<00:04:49.970> had<00:04:50.360> already<00:04:50.570> placed<00:04:51.200> a<00:04:51.640> wall<00:04:52.640> here

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
that I had already placed a wall here

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.480 
that I had already placed a wall here
and<00:04:53.120> I<00:04:53.210> just<00:04:53.240> took<00:04:53.600> it<00:04:53.780> out<00:04:53.930> so<00:04:54.350> if<00:04:54.890> you<00:04:55.040> do<00:04:55.250> that

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
and I just took it out so if you do that

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.610 
and I just took it out so if you do that
is<00:04:55.669> it<00:04:55.820> going<00:04:55.940> to<00:04:56.030> see<00:04:56.180> I<00:04:56.450> break<00:04:57.080> it<00:04:57.290> and<00:04:57.470> no

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
is it going to see I break it and no

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.340 
is it going to see I break it and no
water<00:04:57.830> will<00:04:58.130> come<00:04:58.280> back<00:04:58.400> through<00:04:59.110> so<00:05:00.110> that<00:05:00.290> you

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350 
water will come back through so that you

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.290 
water will come back through so that you
can<00:05:00.500> do<00:05:00.590> that<00:05:00.740> but<00:05:01.400> make<00:05:01.640> just<00:05:01.880> make<00:05:01.910> sure<00:05:02.150> that

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
can do that but make just make sure that

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.409 
can do that but make just make sure that
you<00:05:02.390> just<00:05:02.540> leave<00:05:02.720> the<00:05:02.870> one<00:05:03.080> bottom<00:05:03.620> block<00:05:03.860> open

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:04.419 
you just leave the one bottom block open

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:06.970 
you just leave the one bottom block open
all<00:05:05.419> right<00:05:05.600> so<00:05:05.840> now<00:05:06.020> essentially<00:05:06.500> you<00:05:06.800> are

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:06.980 
all right so now essentially you are

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:09.600 
all right so now essentially you are
done<00:05:07.250> with<00:05:07.430> the<00:05:07.580> build<00:05:07.820> so<00:05:08.360> to<00:05:08.419> demonstrate<00:05:08.900> it

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:09.610 
done with the build so to demonstrate it

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.150 
done with the build so to demonstrate it
this<00:05:10.610> will<00:05:10.790> not<00:05:10.940> work<00:05:10.970> on<00:05:11.300> spiders<00:05:11.950> unless<00:05:12.950> you

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 
this will not work on spiders unless you

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.780 
this will not work on spiders unless you
want<00:05:13.460> to<00:05:13.520> make<00:05:13.760> it<00:05:13.940> one<00:05:14.270> wider<00:05:15.280> but<00:05:16.280> I<00:05:16.460> still

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:16.790 
want to make it one wider but I still

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:18.070 
want to make it one wider but I still
would<00:05:16.910> not<00:05:17.060> recommend<00:05:17.300> use<00:05:17.570> it<00:05:17.690> with<00:05:17.780> spiders

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 
would not recommend use it with spiders

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.760 
would not recommend use it with spiders
because<00:05:18.229> they<00:05:18.410> can<00:05:18.620> climb<00:05:19.010> up<00:05:20.020> so<00:05:21.020> let<00:05:21.470> me<00:05:21.560> put

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:21.770 
because they can climb up so let me put

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:28.360 
because they can climb up so let me put
myself<00:05:21.919> into<00:05:22.630> survival<00:05:23.630> mode<00:05:23.810> and<00:05:27.250> then<00:05:28.250> let

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.370 
myself into survival mode and then let

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.540 
myself into survival mode and then let
me<00:05:28.430> grab<00:05:28.669> some<00:05:28.910> things<00:05:28.940> attention<00:05:29.919> that<00:05:30.919> isn't

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
me grab some things attention that isn't

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:36.580 
me grab some things attention that isn't
a<00:05:31.700> spider

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:36.590 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:42.790 

hmm<00:05:37.660> just<00:05:38.660> try<00:05:38.870> to<00:05:38.930> grab<00:05:39.110> one<00:05:39.380> of<00:05:39.410> these<00:05:41.800> make

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 
hmm just try to grab one of these make

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:53.560 
hmm just try to grab one of these make
sure<00:05:42.830> they<00:05:43.070> all<00:05:43.160> follow<00:05:43.430> me<00:05:50.860> all<00:05:51.860> right<00:05:52.570> so

come up here and then fall down so what

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:00.610 
come up here and then fall down so what
they<00:05:58.730> will<00:05:58.850> do<00:05:59.090> is<00:05:59.660> they<00:05:59.810> come<00:06:00.080> here<00:06:00.260> they<00:06:00.530> will

they will do is they come here they will
climb<00:06:00.889> over<00:06:01.190> but<00:06:01.669> they<00:06:01.790> won't<00:06:01.940> be<00:06:02.030> able<00:06:02.090> to<00:06:02.270> get

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:02.450 
climb over but they won't be able to get

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.770

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.140 
they will just they will fall down here
and<00:06:14.330> then<00:06:15.229> eventually<00:06:16.010> they<00:06:16.729> will<00:06:16.910> start

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:17.150 
and then eventually they will start

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:17.560 
and then eventually they will start
drowning

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:17.570 
drowning

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:22.800

give<00:06:23.810> it<00:06:23.840> a<00:06:23.960> second<00:06:24.580> yeah<00:06:25.639> eventually<00:06:26.389> they

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:26.660 
give it a second yeah eventually they

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:31.330 
give it a second yeah eventually they
will<00:06:26.750> die<00:06:26.810> and<00:06:27.639> something<00:06:28.639> they<00:06:28.760> draw<00:06:30.340> push

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:31.340 
will die and something they draw push

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:35.469 
will die and something they draw push
