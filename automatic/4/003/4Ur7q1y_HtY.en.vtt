00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.470 
Langston you know must learn that and
you<00:02:28.410> would<00:02:28.500> think<00:02:28.650> being<00:02:28.920> down<00:02:29.100> in<00:02:29.130> NXT<00:02:29.700> that

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
you would think being down in NXT that

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.150 
you would think being down in NXT that
he<00:02:30.690> would<00:02:30.870> have<00:02:31.020> you<00:02:31.200> know<00:02:31.320> known<00:02:31.800> what<00:02:32.130> to

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
he would have you know known what to

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.340 
he would have you know known what to
expect<00:02:32.670> and<00:02:32.820> known<00:02:32.970> what<00:02:33.270> to<00:02:33.300> do<00:02:33.570> in<00:02:33.750> what<00:02:34.230> to

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
expect and known what to do in what to

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.020 
expect and known what to do in what to
do<00:02:34.470> in<00:02:34.620> circuit<00:02:35.010> predicaments<00:02:35.640> but<00:02:35.790> I<00:02:35.820> think

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
do in circuit predicaments but I think

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.400 
do in circuit predicaments but I think
Big<00:02:36.180> E<00:02:36.209> links<00:02:36.540> and<00:02:36.660> sometimes<00:02:36.959> gets<00:02:37.200> ahead<00:02:37.350> of

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
Big E links and sometimes gets ahead of

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.170 
Big E links and sometimes gets ahead of
himself<00:02:37.590> and<00:02:38.130> I<00:02:38.520> think<00:02:38.550> that's<00:02:38.820> where<00:02:38.940> Big<00:02:39.150> E

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
himself and I think that's where Big E

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.820 
himself and I think that's where Big E
finds<00:02:39.630> himself<00:02:39.780> in<00:02:40.020> trouble<00:02:40.170> remember<00:02:40.680> he's

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
finds himself in trouble remember he's

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.890 
finds himself in trouble remember he's
