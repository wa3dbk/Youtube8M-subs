 once friend forza mauriÃ±o and has taken 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.080
 a lot of time without uploading a video but 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:09.759
 Well the reason was because I did not have 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.429
 like so much to show you about pes 

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:13.809
 2012 although the league was pending 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:16.090
 more we had to be legend but the 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:18.220
 truth is that it does not advance 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.130
 great thing not and good here is the new 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:23.170
 2013 fish ended it practically from 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.210
 buy come new that meets in 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.400
 blockbuster does just some some 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.380
 hours that the truth arrives I buy it 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.050
 and stay for a while because I am very, very 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:36.160
 very very very tired so then look 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.629

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:42.700
 great this stuff then then let's go 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.920
 open it six times as I think the 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.500
 the second time I upload to the channel that I open 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.940
 a game we are going to see the truth that is going 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.270
 to cost a lot of work then 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.829
 I'm going to tip the camera 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.129

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:05.430

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:07.290

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:45.340
 obviously it's going to turn me to nothing 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.800
