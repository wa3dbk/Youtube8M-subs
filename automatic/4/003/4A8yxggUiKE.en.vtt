me and I don't want to break it all

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.560 
me and I don't want to break it all
right<00:05:24.169> here<00:05:24.350> we<00:05:24.410> go<00:05:24.700> this<00:05:25.700> is<00:05:25.880> really<00:05:26.180> really

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.570 
right here we go this is really really

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:29.020 
right here we go this is really really
cute<00:05:27.020> if<00:05:27.229> you<00:05:27.320> can<00:05:27.500> see<00:05:27.800> that<00:05:27.830> it's<00:05:28.340> got<00:05:28.760> the

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.030 
cute if you can see that it's got the

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:31.750 
cute if you can see that it's got the
silver<00:05:29.570> ball<00:05:29.840> and<00:05:30.260> then<00:05:30.410> this<00:05:30.590> heart<00:05:31.490> i'm

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:31.760 
silver ball and then this heart i'm

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.580 
silver ball and then this heart i'm
thinking<00:05:31.790> it's<00:05:32.240> a<00:05:32.390> drop<00:05:32.690> necklace<00:05:33.050> so<00:05:33.500> it

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
thinking it's a drop necklace so it

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:35.400 
thinking it's a drop necklace so it
probably<00:05:33.830> goes<00:05:34.160> like<00:05:34.400> somewhat<00:05:34.850> like<00:05:35.030> this

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:35.410 
probably goes like somewhat like this

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:38.560 
probably goes like somewhat like this
