00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.460
 you hi everybody welcome on 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:18.410
 this video I hope you are well 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.730
 the friends we meet again 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.890
 today with plenty of information 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.320
 regarding the taking the 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.579
 next destiny dlc then I'll you 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.559
 spoke of the new places we are going 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:29.809
 to be able to visit new enemies 

00:00:27.559 --> 00:00:31.279
 new boss new raids and that's 

00:00:29.809 --> 00:00:32.809
 really full of information 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.280
 we start first with the 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:36.020
 new places so you see it at 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.420
 the screen these phobos fawns 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.500
 we had access via a pvp map and 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.789
 well that's it we'll be able to get there 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.070
 simply because there is a base 

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:45.829
 cabal that is removed there the cabals 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.440
 who is fleeing an enemy especially and that's it 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.790
 will have to help the cabal 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.020
 see also new places 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.980
 present on the earth on 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.020
 different planets 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.120
 this big metal iron ball that 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.350
 is at the top of the earth really 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.180
 very pretty can not wait to visit 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.370
 these new places we will have 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.690
 obviously access to mercury you see it 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.860
 on the screen so that I say come back a 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.479
 little bit later in the video 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.020
 since it really has a very important role 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:07.369
 important 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.930
 in any case I find it really very 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:10.880
 interesting to put mercury especially 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.899
 for those who do osiris and who has me 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.319
 unfortunately we can not seem to have 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:16.909
 access to mercury we will also find the 

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:19.880
 most important place of this next 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.450
 dlc the oryx battleship you see it at 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.399
 the screen 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.020
 so it's really a big ship 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:25.549
 worried in space a ship 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.829
 which is millions of years old 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:29.240
 who saw you with his 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:30.740
 decorations that make you think of the street while 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.380
 simply because oryx is an old 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.939
 king of the hive then in these ships 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.229
 will be full of mechanisms a little bit 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:37.340
 like in a raid to find through 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.200
 missions etc 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.810
 like this platform that appears you 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.790
 see it on the screen right here 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.799
 so there will be plenty of things from 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.450
 missions the raid that was going there was 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:49.009
 this is coming back a little bit as a result 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.560
 you see there will be ceremonies 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.329
 which will also take place in this 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.920
 ship there will also be a lot of 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:56.630
 goals 1 found that this case that's what has 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.340
 been promised by buggy especially this little 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.619
 chest and here are the first pictures 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.570
 of the next raid really looking forward to trying 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:03.409
 bangui promised us once again a 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:05.360
 very big raid 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:06.560
 so I hope this time they have 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.880
 put the package because that's it 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.860
 missing a bit at the last dlc 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.709
 and we can not wait to be able to 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.420
 exploit a game mode to 6 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.459
 the new boss of the next raid is 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.140
 simply oryx at risk and high 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.060
 risk however who is the father of 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.950
 crunches tit for tat is killed 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.700
 income to avenge the death of his 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.200
 son he came 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.480
 ba tried to put us to the amended 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.700
 since here we have dosed his son 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.380
 you're renting a really beautiful post 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.340
 with evidence of species of balls 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.230
 electric 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.330
 they steal they can really badly 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.959
 so you know oryx it's the king of 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.540
 corrupt 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.160
 he has his army you see her here at 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.640
 the screen so in fact in hungary 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.170
 is called layton for its size ken king 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.390
 so it's fighters you see him 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.640
 there is waste of vexes the hive of 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.280
 cabals that were ripped off our 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.269
 dimension by oryx is returned with 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.739
 new powers and new 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.540
 capabilities so you see the options 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.920
 who are splitting you will see also 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.750
 enemies who will jump the gates 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.489
 and there are going to be priestesses who are doing 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.560
 to appear enemies you will see 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.450
 also cabals with shields that 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.560
 throwing ball species not you 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.359
 have plenty of things there are also some 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.530
 enemies who have shields that are going 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:12.470
 train around them when you have 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.970
 started shooting here you could see 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.859
 some cabal teleport 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.299
 also really very good enemies 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:19.040
 so you see they have a flame in 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:20.959
 the fact that burns them from the inside 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.310
 it is to give them an air of torture and 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.540
 you will also see that sometimes 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.130
 will start shaking like you 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.630
 see the video is to show that 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.519
 their minds disagree with that 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.010
 what is happening to the land of their 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:32.359
 body there are also three new 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.340
 doctrines it rolls really very 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:36.170
 important in the new dlc since 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.690
 apparently these new doctrines we 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.010
 are given by the city and the vanguard 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.780
 since apparently we did not have 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.639
 can not afford to beat at 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.290
 ritz without these doctrines so has these 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:47.480
 doctrines will have a special role to 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.160
 play in the next dlc it will take 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.720
 perform different quest for them 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.950
 to recover them so there you see to 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.629
 the end of a quest we retrieve on 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.310
 mercury right before you and saw the 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:57.050
 hunter's doctrine that we recover 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.849
 black garden it seems to me that the doctrine 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.400
 of the organization the recovery cobos 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:02.180
 here you see on the screen 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.220
 I really think it's very good 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.690
 bungie share to put a more role 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.950
 particular about the doctrines of breakdowns 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.120
 or just put them like that 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.620
 the data say here we put some 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.910
 new doctrines no they have a 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.440
 role they happen they are in 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.970
 the story and I find it really 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.470
 very interesting to incorporate the fact 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.840
 to have new doctrines in 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:19.820
 the story here is at the ski level will have 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.070
 again also so there will be full 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.320
 new assaults it was promised by 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.790
 bungie also including an assault 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.710
 exclusive playstation 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.479
 so here's playstation as usual 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.820
 which put forward for exclusivity 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:33.680
 of a year so the exclusives you them 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.020
 will have a year later on xbox there will be 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.400
 also new missions of 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.720
 patrol so that's going to change a little 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.550
 little at the level of patrol missions 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.320
 there will obviously be new 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.610
 events too so that's nice 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.410
 that we always had a little bit of 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.330
 raise the same events protect 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.190
 loire that you kill and lascivious and it is 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.530
 well that's it you set up from 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.570
 new events then frankly we 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.910
 all goodbye think to try this next 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.620
 dlc it's really nice to see that 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.510
 there is the package that has been put and 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.340
 that's it's really even pronounces the 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.900
 word dlc since the beginning of the video but 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.280
 it's more of an extension that's the 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.340
 continuity of the game and if you want 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.750
 it's destiny 1.5 and that's nice 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:10.550
 do not hesitate to tell me what you 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:12.710
 think of this video me I really 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.669
 can not wait to see what happened on the 15th 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.770
 next september 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:17.240
 so at the end of summer on this I you 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.550
 let the friends do not hesitate to like to 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.660
 share the video pass all a good 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.660
 weekend at all 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.270
 sakho
