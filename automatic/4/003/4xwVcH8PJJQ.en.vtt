now<00:02:12.330> you<00:02:12.390> try<00:02:12.629> this<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:12.810> bunch<00:02:12.989> of<00:02:13.050> times

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
now you try this a bunch of times

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.570 
now you try this a bunch of times
it's<00:02:14.080> fill<00:02:14.319> a<00:02:14.349> bunch<00:02:14.530> of<00:02:14.590> times<00:02:14.800> but<00:02:15.340> there

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
it's fill a bunch of times but there

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.089 
it's fill a bunch of times but there
could<00:02:15.819> be<00:02:15.849> maybe<00:02:16.360> maybe<00:02:16.870> this<00:02:17.110> year<00:02:17.349> actual

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
could be maybe maybe this year actual
