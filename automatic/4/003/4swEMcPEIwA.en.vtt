00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:13.480
 in this case we are going to make a boundary 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.480
 Recycled from cereal boxes 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:25.380
 we will take the first measure to the box and 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.460
 with the rule we will measure about 19 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:32.250
 centimeters from the base towards the part 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:35.420
 superior and we will now mark what will be 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.420
 a transverse line 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:50.540
 then we will try to the opposite side of the 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:53.870
 box and we will mark 19 centimeters but 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:56.300
 this part of the reverse side of above 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:59.390
 down we will join the two points with 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.750
 the ruler on the front and back 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.750
 from the box 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:29.150
 let's take the cutter and cut through 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:32.770
 the lines marked if it's easier 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.770
 we will use the scissors 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:40.810
 once finished we will be left 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:43.960
 a way as it is from a higher side 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.090
 and the other lower with the part of 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.490
 above we will already do what is the part of 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.270
 the opening so that we have one 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.270
 firm base 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.960
 I will take an illustration 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.609
 that covers the smaller part since 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.770
 I will use the smaller part but 

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:05.539
 can use the largest 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.539
 we will glue it with glue 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.590
 and on the sides and in the part of 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:18.010
 down and the back that is the most 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.990
 High use white papers as this 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.860
 you will not see because they will be at 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:26.080
 side of another and we will form all this 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.030
 staying in this way in this case 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.520
 use an illustration for three of 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:34.020
 our booksellers and so we created a 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.020
 set or system 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.909
 to 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.349
 yes
