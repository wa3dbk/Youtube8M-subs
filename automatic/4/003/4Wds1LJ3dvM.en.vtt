00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
model on the track and it was amazing

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.020 
model on the track and it was amazing
being<00:01:57.470> my<00:01:57.560> first<00:01:57.680> track<00:01:57.979> by<00:01:58.130> the<00:01:58.189> i-road<00:01:58.549> it

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
being my first track by the i-road it

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.810 
being my first track by the i-road it
feels<00:01:59.600> towards<00:02:00.079> me<00:02:00.170> but<00:02:00.290> it's<00:02:01.040> got<00:02:01.369> that<00:02:01.549> I

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:01.820 
feels towards me but it's got that I

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.730 
feels towards me but it's got that I
suppose<00:02:02.329> a<00:02:02.659> little<00:02:03.049> bit<00:02:03.259> much<00:02:03.409> more<00:02:03.560> forgiving

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
suppose a little bit much more forgiving

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.800 
suppose a little bit much more forgiving
this<00:02:04.009> would<00:02:04.159> you<00:02:04.280> say<00:02:04.460> tiny<00:02:05.119> bit<00:02:05.390> Jenna<00:02:05.689> me

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
this would you say tiny bit Jenna me

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.420 
this would you say tiny bit Jenna me
it's<00:02:05.930> almost<00:02:06.020> easier<00:02:06.409> to<00:02:06.469> ride<00:02:06.710> fast<00:02:07.009> i<00:02:07.219> think

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
it's almost easier to ride fast i think

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.940 
it's almost easier to ride fast i think
it<00:02:07.640> is<00:02:07.700> and<00:02:08.119> I<00:02:08.450> think<00:02:08.660> we're<00:02:09.200> given<00:02:09.440> period<00:02:09.799> of

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
it is and I think we're given period of

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.979 
it is and I think we're given period of
time<00:02:10.040> and<00:02:10.759> when<00:02:11.209> you<00:02:11.269> sort<00:02:11.450> of<00:02:11.570> me<00:02:11.720> give<00:02:11.930> you

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
time and when you sort of me give you

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:12.250 
time and when you sort of me give you
some

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
some

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.770 
some

phenomenal in some ways kind of like 6

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.300 
phenomenal in some ways kind of like 6
700<00:02:57.139> horsepower<00:02:57.349> per<00:02:57.620> ton<00:02:57.829> kind<00:02:58.129> of<00:02:58.190> thing

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
700 horsepower per ton kind of thing

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.940 
700 horsepower per ton kind of thing
which<00:02:59.000> is<00:02:59.450> you<00:02:59.720> know<00:02:59.750> there<00:03:00.170> would<00:03:00.260> be<00:03:00.680> gotten

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
which is you know there would be gotten

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.289 
which is you know there would be gotten
very<00:03:01.040> ones<00:03:01.129> a<00:03:01.310> thousands<00:03:01.670> of<00:03:01.730> Sun<00:03:01.849> isn't<00:03:02.000> it<00:03:02.150> so

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
very ones a thousands of Sun isn't it so

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:04.119 
very ones a thousands of Sun isn't it so
it's<00:03:02.450> not<00:03:02.569> that<00:03:02.629> far<00:03:02.959> off<00:03:03.019> which<00:03:03.409> when<00:03:03.950> you<00:03:04.040> can
