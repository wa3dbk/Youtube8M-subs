wars<00:01:44.610> by<00:01:44.790> that<00:01:44.970> much<00:01:45.149> I<00:01:45.360> thought<00:01:45.540> it<00:01:45.840> was<00:01:45.990> crap

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
wars by that much I thought it was crap

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.260 
wars by that much I thought it was crap
compared<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:46.950> four<00:01:47.159> I<00:01:47.399> think<00:01:47.820> four<00:01:48.030> is<00:01:48.060> the

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
compared to four I think four is the

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.600 
compared to four I think four is the
best<00:01:48.509> at<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.990> time<00:01:49.200> until<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.710> guy<00:01:49.829> order<00:01:50.250> six

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
best at the time until the guy order six

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.840 
best at the time until the guy order six
came<00:01:50.790> out<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.750> dinosaurs<00:01:52.170> five<00:01:52.380> Empire's

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850
