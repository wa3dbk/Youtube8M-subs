using<00:04:51.530> this<00:04:51.680> sandwich<00:04:52.550> method<00:04:52.900> and<00:04:54.220> it's<00:04:55.220> over

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
using this sandwich method and it's over

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.890 
using this sandwich method and it's over
top<00:04:55.640> of<00:04:55.820> the<00:04:56.980> forage

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
top of the forage

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.360 
top of the forage
it's<00:05:00.900> over<00:05:01.110> top<00:05:01.319> of<00:05:01.470> a<00:05:01.590> four<00:05:01.860> inch<00:05:02.360> steel<00:05:03.360> frame

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
it's over top of a four inch steel frame

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.460 
it's over top of a four inch steel frame
the<00:05:05.370> floor<00:05:05.669> so<00:05:06.569> it's<00:05:06.750> making<00:05:06.900> for<00:05:07.169> a<00:05:07.229> nice

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
the floor so it's making for a nice

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.430 
the floor so it's making for a nice
solid<00:05:07.889> floor<00:05:08.630> that's<00:05:09.630> one<00:05:09.900> of<00:05:09.990> the<00:05:10.080> design

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
solid floor that's one of the design

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.620 
solid floor that's one of the design
modifications<00:05:11.280> and<00:05:11.490> why<00:05:11.819> that's<00:05:12.030> just<00:05:12.360> change

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
modifications and why that's just change

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.469 
modifications and why that's just change
over<00:05:13.020> the<00:05:13.199> regular<00:05:13.830> is<00:05:14.180> regularly<00:05:15.180> what<00:05:15.330> they

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:15.479 
over the regular is regularly what they

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:18.490 
over the regular is regularly what they
do<00:05:15.539> is<00:05:15.840> in<00:05:16.020> here<00:05:16.410> in<00:05:16.699> this<00:05:17.699> area<00:05:18.060> right<00:05:18.270> in<00:05:18.330> here

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
do is in here in this area right in here

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:23.180 
do is in here in this area right in here
they<00:05:19.500> have<00:05:19.680> a<00:05:19.710> two<00:05:19.979> by<00:05:20.190> six<00:05:20.720> on<00:05:21.919> the<00:05:22.919> side

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
they have a two by six on the side

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:27.589 
they have a two by six on the side
acting<00:05:23.669> as<00:05:23.789> a<00:05:23.819> floor<00:05:24.120> joist<00:05:24.479> and<00:05:26.389> then<00:05:27.389> what

00:05:27.589 --> 00:05:27.599 
acting as a floor joist and then what

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:30.950 
acting as a floor joist and then what
they<00:05:27.750> do<00:05:27.810> is<00:05:28.130> on<00:05:29.130> top<00:05:29.669> of<00:05:29.849> that<00:05:29.970> they<00:05:30.569> fill<00:05:30.840> that

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
they do is on top of that they fill that

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.689 
they do is on top of that they fill that
with<00:05:31.110> insulation<00:05:31.650> and<00:05:31.979> then<00:05:32.069> on<00:05:32.250> top<00:05:32.460> of<00:05:32.520> that

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:32.699 
with insulation and then on top of that

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:35.480 
with insulation and then on top of that
they<00:05:33.479> have<00:05:33.509> a<00:05:33.740> three-quarter<00:05:34.740> inch<00:05:34.770> subfloor

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
they have a three-quarter inch subfloor

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.700 
they have a three-quarter inch subfloor
and<00:05:35.669> then<00:05:36.539> they<00:05:36.659> put<00:05:36.840> their<00:05:36.990> flooring<00:05:37.349> on<00:05:37.470> top

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 
and then they put their flooring on top

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.649 
and then they put their flooring on top
so<00:05:39.169> overall<00:05:40.169> or<00:05:40.380> thickness<00:05:40.590> of<00:05:40.889> their<00:05:41.069> floor

00:05:41.649 --> 00:05:41.659 
so overall or thickness of their floor

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:46.520 
so overall or thickness of their floor
mine<00:05:42.659> is<00:05:43.020> around<00:05:44.630> right<00:05:45.630> here<00:05:45.810> mine<00:05:46.110> is<00:05:46.139> right

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:46.530 
mine is around right here mine is right

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.430 
mine is around right here mine is right
around<00:05:46.740> two<00:05:47.009> inches<00:05:47.340> sick<00:05:47.870> those<00:05:48.870> ends<00:05:49.289> up

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 
around two inches sick those ends up

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:54.740 
around two inches sick those ends up
being<00:05:49.680> around<00:05:50.780> six<00:05:51.780> inches<00:05:52.190> or<00:05:53.190> so<00:05:53.729> so<00:05:54.330> it's

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.750 
being around six inches or so so it's

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.230 
being around six inches or so so it's
four<00:05:55.080> inches<00:05:55.409> more<00:05:55.680> thickness<00:05:56.280> of<00:05:56.639> floor<00:05:56.970> and

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.240 
four inches more thickness of floor and

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:58.850 
four inches more thickness of floor and
that<00:05:57.720> moves<00:05:57.960> you<00:05:58.139> up<00:05:58.289> toward<00:05:58.560> the<00:05:58.620> ceiling

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 
that moves you up toward the ceiling

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.040 
that moves you up toward the ceiling
four<00:05:59.310> inches<00:05:59.639> higher<00:05:59.699> so<00:06:00.419> you<00:06:00.479> lose<00:06:00.720> four

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.050 
four inches higher so you lose four

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:04.730 
four inches higher so you lose four
inches<00:06:01.349> of<00:06:01.530> headroom<00:06:02.659> so<00:06:03.659> with<00:06:04.349> this<00:06:04.469> type<00:06:04.680> of

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:04.740 
inches of headroom so with this type of

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:06.709 
inches of headroom so with this type of
a<00:06:04.979> floor<00:06:05.250> I'm<00:06:05.400> going<00:06:05.460> to<00:06:05.669> gain<00:06:05.909> four<00:06:06.240> inches<00:06:06.539> of

00:06:06.709 --> 00:06:06.719 
a floor I'm going to gain four inches of

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:08.480 
a floor I'm going to gain four inches of
headroom<00:06:06.900> that's<00:06:07.620> one<00:06:07.860> of<00:06:07.949> the<00:06:08.039> design

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:08.490 
headroom that's one of the design

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:11.360 
headroom that's one of the design
modifications<00:06:09.240> a<00:06:09.360> second<00:06:10.099> thing<00:06:11.099> that<00:06:11.250> I'm

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:11.370 
modifications a second thing that I'm

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:14.240 
modifications a second thing that I'm
doing<00:06:11.400> on<00:06:11.849> this<00:06:12.060> is<00:06:12.469> the<00:06:13.469> front<00:06:13.770> end<00:06:13.949> of<00:06:14.130> this

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.250 
doing on this is the front end of this

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:16.219 
doing on this is the front end of this
thing<00:06:14.729> when<00:06:15.330> it's<00:06:15.449> going<00:06:15.659> down<00:06:15.780> the<00:06:16.050> highway

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:16.229 
thing when it's going down the highway

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:19.249 
thing when it's going down the highway
is<00:06:16.680> going<00:06:16.919> to<00:06:16.979> have<00:06:17.130> to<00:06:17.280> take<00:06:18.259> hurricane-force

00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:19.259 
is going to have to take hurricane-force

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:21.879 
is going to have to take hurricane-force
winds<00:06:19.560> so<00:06:20.430> what<00:06:21.030> I'm<00:06:21.120> doing<00:06:21.419> is<00:06:21.539> I'm<00:06:21.659> putting

00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:21.889 
winds so what I'm doing is I'm putting

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:25.580 
winds so what I'm doing is I'm putting
reinforcements<00:06:22.889> in<00:06:23.570> for<00:06:24.570> that<00:06:24.750> this<00:06:25.169> brace

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:21.000 
way through the steel on the bottom and

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.610 
way through the steel on the bottom and
so<00:07:22.000> that's<00:07:22.210> of<00:07:22.479> making<00:07:22.810> this<00:07:22.930> front<00:07:23.259> end<00:07:23.410> so

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:23.620 
so that's of making this front end so

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:27.570 
so that's of making this front end so
that<00:07:23.650> it's<00:07:24.550> really<00:07:24.910> really<00:07:25.180> solid<00:07:25.419> and<00:07:26.580> then

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:27.580 
that it's really really solid and then

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:30.960 
that it's really really solid and then
at<00:07:27.759> the<00:07:27.880> top<00:07:28.800> I'm<00:07:29.800> going<00:07:30.070> to<00:07:30.160> be<00:07:30.310> anchoring<00:07:30.820> the

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:30.970 
at the top I'm going to be anchoring the

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:35.900 
at the top I'm going to be anchoring the
trusses<00:07:31.360> down<00:07:31.570> in<00:07:31.720> the<00:07:31.810> similar<00:07:32.169> fashion

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:35.910 

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:38.520 

several<00:07:36.910> more<00:07:37.060> design<00:07:37.509> modifications<00:07:38.380> I'm

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:38.530 
several more design modifications I'm

00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:40.830 
several more design modifications I'm
going<00:07:38.680> to<00:07:38.770> get<00:07:38.889> into<00:07:39.220> on<00:07:39.370> the<00:07:39.490> next<00:07:39.520> film<00:07:40.000> so

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:40.840 
going to get into on the next film so

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:45.449 
going to get into on the next film so
that's<00:07:41.050> it<00:07:41.259> for<00:07:41.410> now<00:07:42.210> bye<00:07:43.210> bye
