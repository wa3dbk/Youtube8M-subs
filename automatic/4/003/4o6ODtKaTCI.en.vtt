00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
is this technology about sidesync but

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.690 
is this technology about sidesync but
it's<00:00:32.250> only<00:00:32.399> compatible<00:00:32.759> with<00:00:33.149> some<00:00:33.690> samsung

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:34.700 
it's only compatible with some samsung

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.490 
it's only compatible with some samsung
phones<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:36.090> my<00:00:36.239> galaxy<00:00:36.660> nexus<00:00:36.690> is<00:00:37.110> not<00:00:37.260> one<00:00:37.469> of

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
phones and my galaxy nexus is not one of

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.619 
phones and my galaxy nexus is not one of
them<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:38.250> i've<00:00:38.370> upgraded<00:00:38.520> now<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.210> Moto<00:00:39.390> X

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
them and i've upgraded now to the Moto X

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.780 
them and i've upgraded now to the Moto X
which<00:00:39.870> obviously<00:00:40.200> it's<00:00:40.920> motorola<00:00:41.370> not<00:00:41.640> going

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
which obviously it's motorola not going

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.540 
which obviously it's motorola not going
to<00:00:41.850> be<00:00:41.940> compatible<00:00:42.350> so<00:00:43.399> everything<00:00:44.399> has<00:00:44.520> a

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
to be compatible so everything has a

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.369 
to be compatible so everything has a
connection<00:00:44.850> password<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:46.140> can<00:00:46.170> either

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
connection password and you can either

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.750 
connection password and you can either
do<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:46.620> over<00:00:46.890> USB<00:00:47.219> or<00:00:48.090> over<00:00:49.250> Wi-Fi<00:00:50.250> so<00:00:50.700> I'll

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
do it over USB or over Wi-Fi so I'll

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.779 
do it over USB or over Wi-Fi so I'll
just<00:00:50.820> connect<00:00:51.239> here<00:00:52.460> and<00:00:53.460> now<00:00:53.550> when<00:00:53.699> it

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
just connect here and now when it

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.170 
just connect here and now when it
connects<00:00:55.550> I'll<00:00:56.550> see<00:00:56.820> on<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.000> top

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
connects I'll see on the top

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.810 
connects I'll see on the top
notification<00:00:58.109> on<00:00:58.410> my<00:00:58.469> phone<00:00:58.680> here<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.550> see<00:00:59.699> my

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
notification on my phone here you see my

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.330 
notification on my phone here you see my
phone<00:01:00.000> right<00:01:00.149> away<00:01:00.800> and<00:01:01.800> it's<00:01:02.190> like<00:01:02.309> a

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
phone right away and it's like a

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.250 
phone right away and it's like a
one-to-one<00:01:02.940> so<00:01:03.180> everything<00:01:03.570> I'm<00:01:03.690> doing<00:01:03.719> is

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
one-to-one so everything I'm doing is

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.160 
one-to-one so everything I'm doing is
basically<00:01:04.830> one<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.460> one<00:01:05.810> you<00:01:06.810> see<00:01:06.990> that

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
basically one to one you see that

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.780 
basically one to one you see that
there's<00:01:07.350> some<00:01:07.530> degradation<00:01:08.630> of<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:10.790> colors

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
there's some degradation of the colors

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.270 
there's some degradation of the colors
maybe<00:01:12.420> gradients<00:01:13.049> here<00:01:13.320> however<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:14.250> can

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
maybe gradients here however you can

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.780 
maybe gradients here however you can
launch<00:01:14.580> all<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.880> apps<00:01:15.060> just<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.600> use<00:01:15.840> expect

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
launch all the apps just to use expect

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.020 
launch all the apps just to use expect
this<00:01:17.790> fully<00:01:18.090> works<00:01:18.890> if<00:01:19.890> you're<00:01:20.070> debugging<00:01:20.400> as

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
this fully works if you're debugging as

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.330 
this fully works if you're debugging as
well<00:01:21.380> so<00:01:22.380> if<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:22.530> go<00:01:22.650> through<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.040> you<00:01:23.100> start

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
well so if you go through and you start

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.240 
well so if you go through and you start
debugging<00:01:24.020> from<00:01:25.020> visual<00:01:25.320> studio<00:01:25.710> or<00:01:26.040> exam

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
debugging from visual studio or exam

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.700 
debugging from visual studio or exam
rinse<00:01:26.460> do<00:01:26.670> day<00:01:26.790> of<00:01:26.970> no<00:01:27.180> problem<00:01:27.570> at<00:01:27.689> all<00:01:27.810> so<00:01:28.619> you

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
rinse do day of no problem at all so you

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.789 
rinse do day of no problem at all so you
go<00:01:28.829> through<00:01:29.360> it's<00:01:30.360> really<00:01:31.020> quick<00:01:31.350> I'm<00:01:31.560> really

impressed and the great part here is if

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.800 
impressed and the great part here is if
I<00:01:34.530> was<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:34.799> look<00:01:34.979> at<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.340> cpu<00:01:35.970> usage<00:01:36.180> I<00:01:36.570> pull

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
I was to look at the cpu usage I pull

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.539 
I was to look at the cpu usage I pull
this<00:01:36.900> over<00:01:37.850> the<00:01:38.850> cpu<00:01:39.450> usage<00:01:39.720> of<00:01:40.380> this<00:01:41.280> little

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
this over the cpu usage of this little

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.120 
this over the cpu usage of this little
guy<00:01:41.700> is<00:01:42.060> like<00:01:42.840> nothing<00:01:43.079> i<00:01:43.560> mean<00:01:43.770> there's

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
guy is like nothing i mean there's

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.190 
guy is like nothing i mean there's
probably<00:01:44.369> any<00:01:44.610> cpu<00:01:45.210> sighs<00:01:45.479> I've<00:01:45.600> seen<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.810> spike

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
probably any cpu sighs I've seen a spike

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.319 
probably any cpu sighs I've seen a spike
two<00:01:46.439> maybe<00:01:46.590> three<00:01:46.890> or<00:01:46.920> four<00:01:47.250> percent<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.880> the

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
two maybe three or four percent and the

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.990 
two maybe three or four percent and the
memory<00:01:48.659> usage<00:01:48.810> that<00:01:49.170> 30<00:01:49.860> Meg's<00:01:50.159> which<00:01:50.909> is

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
memory usage that 30 Meg's which is

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.170 
memory usage that 30 Meg's which is
really<00:01:51.210> impressive<00:01:52.189> and<00:01:53.189> like<00:01:53.670> here's<00:01:53.880> here

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
really impressive and like here's here

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
is it going through a list which is

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.370 
is it going through a list which is
pretty<00:01:55.939> snappy<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:57.360> everything<00:01:58.259> is

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
pretty snappy and everything is
