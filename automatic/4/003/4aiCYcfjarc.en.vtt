00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.610 

I've<00:00:04.259> done<00:00:04.560> it<00:00:04.590> both<00:00:05.279> ways<00:00:05.520> and<00:00:05.939> I<00:00:06.600> for<00:00:07.080> years<00:00:07.410> I

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
I've done it both ways and I for years I

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.070 
I've done it both ways and I for years I
believed<00:00:08.010> in<00:00:08.280> in<00:00:08.760> doing<00:00:09.270> it<00:00:09.389> without<00:00:09.540> a<00:00:09.719> road

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
believed in in doing it without a road

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.839 
believed in in doing it without a road
map<00:00:10.320> or<00:00:10.590> any<00:00:10.799> idea<00:00:11.250> of<00:00:11.309> what<00:00:11.520> was<00:00:11.670> going<00:00:11.820> to

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
map or any idea of what was going to

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.600 
map or any idea of what was going to
happen<00:00:12.059> and<00:00:12.480> many<00:00:13.139> times<00:00:13.530> I've<00:00:13.860> sat<00:00:14.099> down<00:00:14.340> and

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
happen and many times I've sat down and

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.999 
happen and many times I've sat down and
just<00:00:14.670> started<00:00:15.240> writing<00:00:15.420> with<00:00:15.630> with<00:00:16.110> no<00:00:16.529> idea

00:00:16.999 --> 00:00:17.009 
just started writing with with no idea

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:19.790 
just started writing with with no idea
what<00:00:17.820> was<00:00:18.000> going<00:00:18.180> to<00:00:18.270> pop<00:00:18.480> up<00:00:18.509> and<00:00:19.050> through

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
what was going to pop up and through

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.159 
what was going to pop up and through
that<00:00:20.009> process<00:00:20.340> I<00:00:20.820> found<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.360> characters<00:00:21.899> and

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:22.169 
that process I found the characters and

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:25.970 
that process I found the characters and
the<00:00:22.349> story<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:23.040> I<00:00:24.000> think<00:00:24.390> writing<00:00:24.930> is<00:00:25.200> really

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
the story and I think writing is really

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.159 
the story and I think writing is really
fun<00:00:26.369> when<00:00:26.550> you<00:00:26.790> get<00:00:27.270> up<00:00:27.419> in<00:00:27.540> the<00:00:27.630> morning<00:00:27.960> and

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:28.169 
fun when you get up in the morning and

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:30.019 
fun when you get up in the morning and
you<00:00:28.349> go<00:00:28.559> back<00:00:28.739> to<00:00:29.040> the<00:00:29.130> machine<00:00:29.460> because<00:00:29.880> you

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
you go back to the machine because you

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.940 
you go back to the machine because you
want<00:00:30.239> to<00:00:30.300> know<00:00:30.419> what<00:00:30.570> happens<00:00:30.899> next<00:00:30.989> but<00:00:31.919> you

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:31.950 
want to know what happens next but you

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.290 
want to know what happens next but you
don't<00:00:32.189> have<00:00:32.250> any<00:00:32.430> idea<00:00:32.730> what<00:00:32.880> that's<00:00:33.059> going<00:00:33.239> to

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
don't have any idea what that's going to

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.400 
don't have any idea what that's going to
be<00:00:33.800> so<00:00:34.800> I<00:00:34.829> think<00:00:35.570> wonderful<00:00:36.570> novels<00:00:36.960> can<00:00:37.260> be

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
be so I think wonderful novels can be

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.890 
be so I think wonderful novels can be
born<00:00:37.710> from<00:00:38.160> that<00:00:38.310> method<00:00:38.760> there's<00:00:39.000> no<00:00:39.150> there's

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:39.900 
born from that method there's no there's

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.390 
born from that method there's no there's
nothing<00:00:40.170> wrong<00:00:40.320> with<00:00:40.470> that<00:00:40.650> method<00:00:41.100> that<00:00:41.250> is<00:00:41.370> a

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:41.400 
nothing wrong with that method that is a

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.280 
nothing wrong with that method that is a
wonderful<00:00:41.940> way<00:00:42.030> because<00:00:42.390> your<00:00:43.020> subconscious

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
wonderful way because your subconscious

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.470 
wonderful way because your subconscious
and<00:00:43.800> your<00:00:43.920> conscious<00:00:44.340> are<00:00:44.490> both<00:00:44.670> organizing

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
and your conscious are both organizing

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.900 
and your conscious are both organizing
that<00:00:45.600> material<00:00:46.170> for<00:00:46.410> you<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.860> as<00:00:47.130> long<00:00:47.550> as<00:00:47.730> you

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
that material for you and as long as you

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.300 
that material for you and as long as you
are<00:00:48.710> moving<00:00:50.660> forward<00:00:51.660> with<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:52.200> with<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.650> fine

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:53.310 
are moving forward with a with a fine

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.280 
are moving forward with a with a fine
sense<00:00:53.700> of<00:00:53.880> what<00:00:54.060> feels<00:00:54.329> authentic<00:00:54.540> and<00:00:55.170> what

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:55.290 
sense of what feels authentic and what

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.560 
sense of what feels authentic and what
doesn't<00:00:55.860> I<00:00:56.070> think<00:00:56.400> it's<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.850> fine<00:00:57.030> way<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.300> write

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
doesn't I think it's a fine way to write

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.069 
doesn't I think it's a fine way to write
a<00:00:57.600> novel

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
a novel

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.810

what was exciting were the surprises the
the<00:02:32.800> things<00:02:33.010> I<00:02:33.160> hadn't<00:02:33.580> foreseen<00:02:34.000> the

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
with the main character and just

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.180 
with the main character and just
completely<00:02:40.990> surprised<00:02:41.410> me<00:02:41.650> by<00:02:41.800> the<00:02:41.860> things

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
completely surprised me by the things

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.400 
completely surprised me by the things
that<00:02:42.370> came<00:02:42.550> out<00:02:42.610> this<00:02:43.330> happens<00:02:43.720> in<00:02:43.900> every<00:02:44.170> book

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
that came out this happens in every book

that came out this happens in every book
and<00:02:44.860> I<00:02:45.370> think<00:02:45.520> it's<00:02:45.820> a<00:02:45.940> wonderful<00:02:46.150> and

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
and I think it's a wonderful and

and I think it's a wonderful and
exciting<00:02:46.570> thing<00:02:47.200> so<00:02:47.560> I<00:02:47.770> think<00:02:48.430> your<00:02:48.760> question

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
exciting thing so I think your question

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.750 
exciting thing so I think your question
is<00:02:49.239> important<00:02:49.840> because<00:02:49.989> inevitably<00:02:50.760> whether

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
is important because inevitably whether

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.910 
is important because inevitably whether
you<00:02:51.970> start<00:02:52.480> with<00:02:52.660> a<00:02:52.690> roadmap<00:02:53.140> whether<00:02:53.800> you

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
you start with a roadmap whether you

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.830 
you start with a roadmap whether you
start<00:02:54.220> with<00:02:54.340> a<00:02:54.370> whole<00:02:54.670> detailed<00:02:55.180> idea<00:02:55.630> whether

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
start with a whole detailed idea whether

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.720 
start with a whole detailed idea whether
you<00:02:55.959> start<00:02:56.230> with<00:02:56.380> nothing<00:02:56.459> basically<00:02:57.459> doing

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
you start with nothing basically doing

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.300 
you start with nothing basically doing
the<00:02:57.940> same<00:02:57.970> thing<00:02:58.540> you're<00:02:59.170> you're<00:02:59.709> you're

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
the same thing you're you're you're

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.250 
the same thing you're you're you're
putting<00:03:00.550> everything<00:03:01.030> you<00:03:01.330> know<00:03:01.540> into<00:03:02.110> this

putting everything you know into this
this<00:03:02.709> story<00:03:03.040> and<00:03:03.430> you're<00:03:04.120> feeling<00:03:04.770> you're

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
pages if necessary and throw them away

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.979 
pages if necessary and throw them away
if<00:03:13.900> you<00:03:14.290> take<00:03:14.530> a<00:03:14.560> wrong<00:03:14.800> turn<00:03:14.860> in<00:03:15.160> the<00:03:15.459> novel

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
if you take a wrong turn in the novel

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.900 
if you take a wrong turn in the novel
and<00:03:16.989> you<00:03:17.320> have<00:03:17.500> to<00:03:17.620> go<00:03:17.830> back<00:03:18.070> to<00:03:18.370> where<00:03:18.549> it<00:03:18.670> last

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
and you have to go back to where it last

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.970 
and you have to go back to where it last
felt<00:03:19.209> really<00:03:19.420> good<00:03:19.690> and<00:03:19.930> go<00:03:20.320> on<00:03:20.500> from<00:03:20.769> there

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
felt really good and go on from there

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.220 
felt really good and go on from there
and<00:03:21.250> for<00:03:22.209> some<00:03:22.390> people<00:03:22.540> this<00:03:22.810> might<00:03:22.989> be<00:03:23.140> a<00:03:23.170> very

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
and for some people this might be a very

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.680 
and for some people this might be a very
sloppy<00:03:23.709> way<00:03:24.010> of<00:03:24.489> working<00:03:24.790> but<00:03:25.060> for<00:03:25.120> me<00:03:25.420> it's

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
sloppy way of working but for me it's

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.910 
sloppy way of working but for me it's
really<00:03:26.410> the<00:03:26.590> only<00:03:26.620> way<00:03:26.950> and<00:03:27.810> I<00:03:28.810> really<00:03:29.680> loved

with<00:03:40.209> the<00:03:40.330> blank<00:03:40.570> screen<00:03:40.780> and<00:03:41.350> just<00:03:41.739> go<00:03:42.400> and

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
with the blank screen and just go and

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.910 
with the blank screen and just go and
just<00:03:42.970> see<00:03:43.209> what<00:03:43.390> what<00:03:43.720> would<00:03:43.900> come<00:03:44.079> up<00:03:44.260> I<00:03:44.470> think

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
just see what what would come up I think

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.009 
just see what what would come up I think
it's<00:03:45.070> I<00:03:45.310> think<00:03:45.579> we're<00:03:45.940> fully<00:03:46.150> entitled<00:03:46.570> to<00:03:46.900> do

it's I think we're fully entitled to do

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:50.039 
it's I think we're fully entitled to do
that<00:03:47.200> and<00:03:47.380> we<00:03:47.470> should<00:03:47.680> do<00:03:47.860> that<00:03:48.870> that's<00:03:49.870> a<00:03:49.959> good

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
that and we should do that that's a good

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:52.860 
that and we should do that that's a good
