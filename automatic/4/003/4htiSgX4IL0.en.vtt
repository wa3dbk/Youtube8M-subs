actually<00:03:09.709> little<00:03:09.890> two<00:03:10.160> dots<00:03:10.519> maybe<00:03:10.970> I'm

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:11.329

sure if you can drive it yet or

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.460 
sure if you can drive it yet or
something<00:04:32.090> but<00:04:32.270> it<00:04:32.390> looks<00:04:32.600> like<00:04:32.720> you<00:04:33.200> know<00:04:33.290> why

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
something but it looks like you know why

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.320 
something but it looks like you know why
would<00:04:33.620> I<00:04:33.650> just<00:04:33.830> stand<00:04:34.100> there<00:04:34.190> and<00:04:34.820> again<00:04:35.300> I

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
would I just stand there and again I

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.780 
would I just stand there and again I
remember<00:04:35.900> on<00:04:36.260> some<00:04:36.530> text<00:04:37.040> someone<00:04:37.460> did<00:04:37.640> say

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:37.790 
remember on some text someone did say

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.280 
remember on some text someone did say
that<00:04:37.940> there<00:04:38.030> are<00:04:38.210> vehicles<00:04:38.480> in<00:04:38.840> multiplayer

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
that there are vehicles in multiplayer

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:48.590 
that there are vehicles in multiplayer
so<00:04:39.620> we're<00:04:40.400> only<00:04:40.550> guessing<00:04:40.850> so

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.630 

and<00:04:49.230> then<00:04:49.650> you're<00:04:49.860> just<00:04:49.890> saw<00:04:50.160> a<00:04:50.190> grenade<00:04:50.460> over

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:50.640 
and then you're just saw a grenade over

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:55.640 
and then you're just saw a grenade over
there<00:04:50.870> and<00:04:51.870> look<00:04:52.200> at<00:04:52.350> an<00:04:52.410> explosion<00:04:52.680> whoo<00:04:54.650> and

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
there and look at an explosion whoo and

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.350 
there and look at an explosion whoo and
here<00:04:55.860> we<00:04:55.950> go<00:04:55.980> again<00:04:56.220> we<00:04:56.460> see<00:04:56.640> this<00:04:56.820> kind<00:04:57.000> of<00:04:57.150> new

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
here we go again we see this kind of new

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.000 
here we go again we see this kind of new
red<00:04:57.810> outline<00:04:58.140> know<00:04:58.260> this<00:04:58.470> will<00:04:58.620> kind<00:04:58.860> of

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
red outline know this will kind of

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.370 
red outline know this will kind of
awareness<00:04:59.370> perk<00:04:59.850> to<00:05:00.060> it<00:05:00.210> I'm<00:05:00.390> not<00:05:01.320> sure

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
awareness perk to it I'm not sure

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.550 
awareness perk to it I'm not sure
exactly<00:05:02.310> how<00:05:02.580> it<00:05:02.850> works<00:05:03.120> quite<00:05:03.630> yet<00:05:03.900> maybe

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
exactly how it works quite yet maybe

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.830 
exactly how it works quite yet maybe
only<00:05:04.890> when<00:05:05.130> there's<00:05:05.280> radar<00:05:05.670> or<00:05:05.910> something<00:05:06.540> not

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
only when there's radar or something not

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.990 
only when there's radar or something not
too<00:05:07.050> sure<00:05:07.230> on<00:05:07.350> that<00:05:07.410> but<00:05:07.830> we'll<00:05:08.520> game<00:05:08.670> what<00:05:08.850> to

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
too sure on that but we'll game what to

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.330 
too sure on that but we'll game what to

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930
