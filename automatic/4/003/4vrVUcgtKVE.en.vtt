00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
this is the gas pipe that we had set up

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:36.149 
this is the gas pipe that we had set up
earlier<00:01:30.729> and<00:01:31.080> it's<00:01:32.430> mounted<00:01:33.430> with<00:01:33.640> a<00:01:33.850> gas<00:01:35.159> a

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.130 
plumbers of strap with a bolt through it
and<00:01:39.820> then<00:01:39.909> it's<00:01:40.030> built<00:01:40.240> it<00:01:40.390> in<00:01:40.510> the<00:01:40.630> back<00:01:40.810> it's

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
and then it's built it in the back it's

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.960 
and then it's built it in the back it's
real<00:01:41.320> nice<00:01:41.500> and<00:01:41.770> solid<00:01:41.950> this<00:01:42.220> is<00:01:42.280> exactly<00:01:42.760> what

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
real nice and solid this is exactly what

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.810 
real nice and solid this is exactly what
I<00:01:43.000> have<00:01:43.270> in<00:01:43.299> the<00:01:43.570> tinker's<00:01:43.870> workshop<00:01:44.260> the<00:01:45.159> this

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
I have in the tinker's workshop the this

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.940 
I have in the tinker's workshop the this
machine<00:01:46.180> here<00:01:46.750> is<00:01:46.900> a<00:01:46.930> little<00:01:47.260> bit<00:01:47.350> taller<00:01:47.590> I

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
machine here is a little bit taller I

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.719 
machine here is a little bit taller I
change<00:01:48.880> the<00:01:49.440> height<00:01:50.440> wise<00:01:50.860> here<00:01:51.310> we<00:01:51.460> change

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
change the height wise here we change

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:53.550 
change the height wise here we change
this<00:01:51.970> and<00:01:52.240> move<00:01:52.690> this<00:01:52.840> up<00:01:52.990> a<00:01:53.110> good<00:01:53.290> three

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
this and move this up a good three

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.530 
this and move this up a good three
inches<00:01:53.890> because<00:01:54.430> we<00:01:54.670> have<00:01:54.850> enough<00:01:55.119> clearance

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
inches because we have enough clearance

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.130 
inches because we have enough clearance
when<00:01:55.840> this<00:01:56.080> gets<00:01:56.260> mounted<00:01:56.770> here<00:01:57.159> and<00:01:57.430> there

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
when this gets mounted here and there

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.020 
when this gets mounted here and there
like<00:01:59.140> that<00:01:59.470> this<00:02:00.070> will<00:02:00.220> go<00:02:00.369> up<00:02:00.490> and<00:02:00.700> down<00:02:00.850> like

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
like that this will go up and down like

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.250 
like that this will go up and down like
this<00:02:01.180> there's<00:02:01.450> more<00:02:01.510> than<00:02:01.780> enough<00:02:01.810> clearance

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.260 
this there's more than enough clearance

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.460 
this there's more than enough clearance
to<00:02:02.760> on<00:02:03.760> these<00:02:04.000> pipes<00:02:04.270> to<00:02:04.540> to<00:02:04.869> make<00:02:05.020> that<00:02:05.229> work

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 
to on these pipes to to make that work

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.740 
to on these pipes to to make that work
with<00:02:05.710> the<00:02:05.799> extra<00:02:06.189> the<00:02:06.700> extra<00:02:07.090> height<00:02:07.270> this

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
with the extra the extra height this

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.610 
with the extra the extra height this
also<00:02:07.990> has<00:02:08.319> the<00:02:08.530> new<00:02:09.039> t-slot<00:02:09.519> table<00:02:09.970> and<00:02:10.620> the

tinkers<00:02:11.920> workshop<00:02:12.250> I'm<00:02:12.459> going<00:02:12.610> to<00:02:12.670> end<00:02:12.819> up

00:02:12.929 --> 00:02:12.939 
tinkers workshop I'm going to end up

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:16.410 
tinkers workshop I'm going to end up
changing<00:02:13.209> that<00:02:13.620> in<00:02:14.620> the<00:02:14.920> in<00:02:15.099> my<00:02:15.790> of<00:02:16.120> my<00:02:16.299> own

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
changing that in the in my of my own

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.289 
changing that in the in my of my own
personal<00:02:16.900> CNC<00:02:17.670> because<00:02:18.670> it's<00:02:18.819> a<00:02:18.909> much<00:02:19.090> easier

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:19.299 
personal CNC because it's a much easier

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:24.960 
personal CNC because it's a much easier
way<00:02:19.840> to<00:02:20.189> mount<00:02:21.189> the<00:02:21.810> mount<00:02:22.810> the<00:02:23.370> parts<00:02:24.370> to<00:02:24.640> to

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
way to mount the mount the parts to to

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.519 
way to mount the mount the parts to to
be<00:02:25.090> milled<00:02:25.329> so<00:02:25.569> now<00:02:25.719> we<00:02:25.810> just<00:02:26.079> come<00:02:26.230> from<00:02:26.349> the

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:26.529 
be milled so now we just come from the

00:02:26.529 --> 00:02:27.640 
be milled so now we just come from the
front

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
front

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.280 
front
and<00:02:27.830> slide<00:02:28.310> it<00:02:28.489> down<00:02:28.640> and<00:02:28.970> clamp<00:02:29.540> it<00:02:29.660> it's<00:02:30.050> so

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
and slide it down and clamp it it's so

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.460 
and slide it down and clamp it it's so
much<00:02:30.349> easier<00:02:30.470> and<00:02:30.860> and<00:02:31.160> quicker<00:02:31.940> to<00:02:32.030> to<00:02:32.750> go

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
much easier and and quicker to to go

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.670 
much easier and and quicker to to go
that<00:02:33.680> route<00:02:34.569> the<00:02:35.569> reason<00:02:35.900> why<00:02:36.019> we're<00:02:36.290> being

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
that route the reason why we're being

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.640 
that route the reason why we're being
delayed<00:02:37.069> so<00:02:37.489> much<00:02:37.670> in<00:02:37.940> this<00:02:38.239> build<00:02:38.510> is<00:02:38.959> the

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
delayed so much in this build is the

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.470 
delayed so much in this build is the
we're<00:02:39.980> still<00:02:40.190> waiting<00:02:40.430> for<00:02:40.459> the<00:02:40.670> electronic

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
we're still waiting for the electronic

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.030 
we're still waiting for the electronic
parts<00:02:41.780> to<00:02:41.930> show<00:02:42.080> up<00:02:42.200> the<00:02:42.410> stepper<00:02:42.680> motors

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
parts to show up the stepper motors

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.000 
parts to show up the stepper motors
themselves<00:02:43.519> on<00:02:43.700> the<00:02:43.849> circuit<00:02:44.569> tree<00:02:44.830> when<00:02:45.830> that

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
themselves on the circuit tree when that

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.850 
themselves on the circuit tree when that
comes<00:02:46.280> in<00:02:46.459> we'll<00:02:46.700> do<00:02:47.030> a<00:02:47.060> video<00:02:47.239> of<00:02:47.420> that<00:02:47.720> in<00:02:48.049> the

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
comes in we'll do a video of that in the

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.640 
comes in we'll do a video of that in the
way<00:02:48.950> it<00:02:49.040> looks<00:02:49.190> now<00:02:49.250> it'll<00:02:49.549> be<00:02:49.580> part<00:02:49.849> six<00:02:50.530> so<00:02:51.530> we

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
way it looks now it'll be part six so we

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.500 
way it looks now it'll be part six so we
can't<00:02:51.920> finish<00:02:52.220> the<00:02:52.489> assembly<00:02:52.790> until<00:02:53.060> we<00:02:53.360> do

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
can't finish the assembly until we do

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.949 
can't finish the assembly until we do
get<00:02:53.660> those<00:02:53.840> components<00:02:55.390> but<00:02:56.390> today<00:02:56.629> we'll<00:02:56.810> get

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
get those components but today we'll get

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.410 
get those components but today we'll get
them<00:02:57.110> the<00:02:57.349> rods<00:02:57.560> mounted<00:02:58.069> and<00:02:58.340> I<00:02:59.060> think<00:02:59.299> we'll

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
them the rods mounted and I think we'll

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.830 
them the rods mounted and I think we'll
mount<00:02:59.690> the<00:02:59.930> Z<00:03:00.310> carriage<00:03:01.310> and<00:03:01.610> get<00:03:02.329> that<00:03:02.480> set<00:03:02.810> up

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
mount the Z carriage and get that set up

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.780 
mount the Z carriage and get that set up
and<00:03:03.170> we'll<00:03:03.290> show<00:03:03.319> video<00:03:03.769> of<00:03:03.920> that<00:03:04.040> today<00:03:04.430> and

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
and we'll show video of that today and

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.020 
and we'll show video of that today and
see<00:03:05.690> how<00:03:05.720> that<00:03:05.900> goes

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
see how that goes

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.140 
see how that goes
okay<00:03:08.030> now<00:03:08.269> we've<00:03:08.510> got<00:03:08.540> the<00:03:09.549> wine<00:03:10.549> country<00:03:10.790> into

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
okay now we've got the wine country into

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.900 
okay now we've got the wine country into
Z<00:03:11.829> actually<00:03:12.829> setup<00:03:13.310> we've<00:03:13.579> got<00:03:13.700> it<00:03:13.790> all

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
Z actually setup we've got it all

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.449 
Z actually setup we've got it all
mounted<00:03:14.360> up<00:03:14.510> and<00:03:14.720> nice<00:03:15.680> and<00:03:15.890> smooth<00:03:16.129> we<00:03:16.340> have

mounted up and nice and smooth we have

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.819 
mounted up and nice and smooth we have
to<00:03:16.549> make<00:03:16.670> adjustments<00:03:17.329> in<00:03:17.450> the<00:03:17.870> threaded<00:03:18.620> rods

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:18.829 
to make adjustments in the threaded rods

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:23.740 
to make adjustments in the threaded rods
in<00:03:19.129> the<00:03:19.250> back<00:03:19.430> and<00:03:20.329> so<00:03:20.930> nice<00:03:21.620> here<00:03:22.430> the<00:03:23.060> z<00:03:23.299> axes

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
in the back and so nice here the z axes

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.780 
in the back and so nice here the z axes
for<00:03:23.959> the<00:03:24.200> robber<00:03:24.500> will<00:03:24.709> be<00:03:24.860> mounted<00:03:25.340> in<00:03:25.489> here

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
for the robber will be mounted in here

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:26.890 
for the robber will be mounted in here
and<00:03:25.910> this<00:03:26.000> will<00:03:26.150> go<00:03:26.239> up<00:03:26.390> and<00:03:26.569> down<00:03:26.660> this

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
and this will go up and down this

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.620 
and this will go up and down this
direction<00:03:27.459> these<00:03:28.459> mounts<00:03:28.970> here<00:03:29.260> are<00:03:30.260> for<00:03:30.680> the

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
direction these mounts here are for the

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.569 
direction these mounts here are for the
cabling<00:03:32.630> that<00:03:32.870> goes<00:03:33.049> to<00:03:33.260> the<00:03:33.350> power<00:03:33.590> for<00:03:34.250> the

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:34.579 
cabling that goes to the power for the

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:37.509 
cabling that goes to the power for the
stepper<00:03:35.329> motor<00:03:35.600> and<00:03:35.810> for<00:03:36.319> the<00:03:36.440> router<00:03:36.650> so<00:03:37.310> that

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
stepper motor and for the router so that

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:40.750 
stepper motor and for the router so that
when<00:03:37.670> twisting<00:03:38.150> the<00:03:38.630> entry<00:03:38.989> or<00:03:39.410> the<00:03:39.650> y<00:03:40.310> axis

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
when twisting the entry or the y axis

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.559 
when twisting the entry or the y axis
moves<00:03:41.060> across<00:03:41.299> it'll<00:03:42.200> pull<00:03:42.410> this<00:03:42.620> down<00:03:42.889> and

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:43.569 
moves across it'll pull this down and

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:46.150 
moves across it'll pull this down and
then<00:03:44.569> do<00:03:45.170> the<00:03:45.290> same<00:03:45.500> thing<00:03:45.650> on<00:03:45.739> the<00:03:45.859> opposite

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
then do the same thing on the opposite

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.920 
then do the same thing on the opposite
side<00:03:46.340> these<00:03:46.609> are<00:03:46.849> so<00:03:47.150> that<00:03:47.180> the<00:03:47.420> wires<00:03:47.630> don't

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
side these are so that the wires don't

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.610 
side these are so that the wires don't
come<00:03:48.859> down<00:03:49.069> and<00:03:49.370> touch<00:03:50.150> your<00:03:50.450> workpiece<00:03:51.290> when

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
come down and touch your workpiece when

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.379 
come down and touch your workpiece when
you're<00:03:51.829> working<00:03:52.190> on<00:03:52.310> it<00:03:52.489> it<00:03:52.880> keeps<00:03:53.150> it<00:03:53.269> all

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:53.389 
you're working on it it keeps it all

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:55.120 
you're working on it it keeps it all
free<00:03:53.720> and<00:03:53.870> clear<00:03:54.139> but<00:03:54.680> then<00:03:54.829> it's<00:03:54.980> all

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
free and clear but then it's all

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.339 
free and clear but then it's all
spring-loaded<00:03:55.910> these<00:03:56.690> are<00:03:56.870> nothing<00:03:57.049> more

00:03:57.339 --> 00:03:57.349 
spring-loaded these are nothing more

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:58.930 
spring-loaded these are nothing more
than<00:03:57.410> little<00:03:57.709> blocks<00:03:57.980> with<00:03:58.310> springs<00:03:58.639> in<00:03:58.819> them

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
than little blocks with springs in them

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.030 
than little blocks with springs in them
and<00:03:59.120> there's<00:03:59.959> lots<00:04:00.139> and<00:04:00.380> then<00:04:00.500> your<00:04:00.680> cabling

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
and there's lots and then your cabling

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.659 
and there's lots and then your cabling
comes<00:04:01.250> up<00:04:01.430> and<00:04:01.639> gets<00:04:01.880> strapped<00:04:02.209> down<00:04:02.450> with

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:03.669 
comes up and gets strapped down with

comes up and gets strapped down with
twist<00:04:04.669> ties<00:04:04.849> or<00:04:05.299> you<00:04:05.569> could<00:04:05.720> use<00:04:06.130> duct<00:04:07.130> tape

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
twist ties or you could use duct tape

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.030 
twist ties or you could use duct tape
whatever<00:04:07.760> you<00:04:07.880> want<00:04:08.030> to<00:04:08.090> use<00:04:08.269> to<00:04:08.540> to<00:04:09.500> tie<00:04:09.859> your

whatever you want to use to to tie your
wires<00:04:10.280> to<00:04:10.669> these<00:04:10.849> and<00:04:11.180> get<00:04:11.569> them<00:04:11.660> routed<00:04:11.989> to<00:04:12.139> so

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:12.829 
wires to these and get them routed to so

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.900 
the next video you'll see will will
hopefully<00:04:18.229> have<00:04:18.590> the<00:04:18.799> stepper<00:04:19.160> motors<00:04:19.489> we've

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
hopefully have the stepper motors we've

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.159 
hopefully have the stepper motors we've
got<00:04:20.030> a<00:04:20.060> stepper<00:04:20.329> motor<00:04:20.599> that<00:04:20.780> gets<00:04:20.930> mounted

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 
got a stepper motor that gets mounted

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:24.310 
got a stepper motor that gets mounted
here<00:04:21.680> this<00:04:21.979> is<00:04:22.160> formula<00:04:22.610> y<00:04:23.210> axes<00:04:23.660> here<00:04:23.930> another

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
here this is formula y axes here another

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.580 
here this is formula y axes here another
stepper<00:04:24.830> here<00:04:25.400> that<00:04:26.030> moves<00:04:26.419> your<00:04:26.599> z-axis<00:04:26.870> and

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
stepper here that moves your z-axis and

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.250 
stepper here that moves your z-axis and
then<00:04:28.310> in<00:04:28.490> the<00:04:28.639> back<00:04:28.820> it<00:04:29.270> is<00:04:29.570> a<00:04:29.599> stepper<00:04:29.960> motor

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
then in the back it is a stepper motor

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.350 
then in the back it is a stepper motor
it<00:04:30.320> gets<00:04:30.470> mounted<00:04:30.680> and<00:04:30.979> runs<00:04:31.190> threaded<00:04:32.150> rods

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
it gets mounted and runs threaded rods

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.140 
it gets mounted and runs threaded rods
here<00:04:33.050> that<00:04:33.289> gets<00:04:33.500> to<00:04:33.860> move

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
here that gets to move

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:40.969 
here that gets to move
the<00:04:36.150> X<00:04:36.330> x<00:04:37.009> axis<00:04:38.009> four<00:04:38.970> and<00:04:39.150> a<00:04:39.210> half<00:04:39.710> so<00:04:40.710> that'll

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:40.979 
the X x axis four and a half so that'll

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:45.080 
the X x axis four and a half so that'll
be<00:04:41.100> in<00:04:41.250> probably<00:04:42.030> part<00:04:42.389> six<00:04:42.780> of<00:04:43.490> the<00:04:44.490> build

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
be in probably part six of the build

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.110 
be in probably part six of the build
here<00:04:45.419> so<00:04:46.020> that's<00:04:46.199> about<00:04:46.320> it<00:04:46.440> for<00:04:46.590> today<00:04:47.120> stay

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
here so that's about it for today stay

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.540 
here so that's about it for today stay
tuned<00:04:48.509> and<00:04:48.690> we'll<00:04:48.900> check<00:04:49.770> up<00:04:49.949> check<00:04:50.220> out<00:04:50.400> the

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
tuned and we'll check up check out the

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.550 
tuned and we'll check up check out the
blog<00:04:50.699> again<00:04:50.880> that<00:04:51.210> hopefully<00:04:51.840> watch<00:04:52.020> the<00:04:52.289> part

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560 
blog again that hopefully watch the part

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.260 
blog again that hopefully watch the part
6<00:04:52.830> and<00:04:53.009> get<00:04:53.310> this<00:04:53.460> up<00:04:53.669> and<00:04:53.820> moving

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
6 and get this up and moving

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.690 
6 and get this up and moving
Thanks
