this<00:02:14.250> way<00:02:14.780> tighten<00:02:15.780> my<00:02:15.900> little<00:02:16.400> connector

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
this way tighten my little connector

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.009 
this way tighten my little connector
here<00:02:20.390> still<00:02:21.390> even<00:02:21.540> in<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:21.840> down<00:02:21.989> position

that doesn't block things too much and

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:32.030 
that doesn't block things too much and
then<00:02:25.170> drop<00:02:25.980> in<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.459> GPS<00:02:26.820> unit<00:02:28.700> like<00:02:29.700> so<00:02:31.040> now

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
then drop in the GPS unit like so now

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:39.340 
then drop in the GPS unit like so now

it<00:03:47.790> works<00:03:48.790> quite<00:03:49.150> well<00:03:49.209> I've<00:03:49.780> had<00:03:50.200> it<00:03:50.350> for

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
it works quite well I've had it for

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:51.900 
it works quite well I've had it for
about<00:03:50.620> a<00:03:50.739> month<00:03:50.980> and<00:03:51.160> the<00:03:51.280> only<00:03:51.520> issue<00:03:51.670> I've

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
about a month and the only issue I've

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.140 
about a month and the only issue I've
run<00:03:52.120> into<00:03:52.300> so<00:03:52.750> far<00:03:53.050> is<00:03:53.320> the<00:03:54.220> vibrations<00:03:54.910> and

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
run into so far is the vibrations and

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 
and it's need the occasional blast out

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.600 
and it's need the occasional blast out
with<00:04:09.040> some<00:04:09.190> compressed<00:04:09.610> air<00:04:09.820> and<00:04:11.610> actually

lightweight<00:04:31.240> and<00:04:31.630> I<00:04:32.500> do<00:04:32.560> like<00:04:32.830> the<00:04:32.950> fact<00:04:32.979> that

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
lightweight and I do like the fact that

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.190 
lightweight and I do like the fact that
it<00:04:33.910> quickly<00:04:34.210> gets<00:04:34.450> out<00:04:34.630> of<00:04:34.690> the<00:04:34.750> way<00:04:34.780> and<00:04:35.080> it

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
it quickly gets out of the way and it

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.640 
it quickly gets out of the way and it
doesn't<00:04:35.470> block<00:04:35.590> the<00:04:35.650> gauges<00:04:36.190> at<00:04:36.340> all<00:04:37.650> GPS

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
doesn't block the gauges at all GPS

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.469 
doesn't block the gauges at all GPS
itself<00:04:39.040> is<00:04:39.220> not<00:04:39.729> a<00:04:39.760> very<00:04:40.090> good<00:04:40.210> one

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:40.479 
itself is not a very good one

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:42.690 
itself is not a very good one
unfortunately<00:04:41.350> I<00:04:41.380> can't<00:04:41.710> recommend<00:04:41.919> mio<00:04:42.430> as

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 
unfortunately I can't recommend mio as

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.380 
unfortunately I can't recommend mio as
GPS<00:04:43.919> direction<00:04:44.919> wise<00:04:45.070> is<00:04:45.280> pretty<00:04:45.520> good<00:04:45.669> I<00:04:45.940> have

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
GPS direction wise is pretty good I have

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.659 
GPS direction wise is pretty good I have
to<00:04:46.570> purchase<00:04:47.320> support<00:04:47.890> as<00:04:48.010> terrible<00:04:48.370> you

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:48.669 
to purchase support as terrible you

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:49.980 
to purchase support as terrible you
can't<00:04:48.880> buy<00:04:49.030> a<00:04:49.060> new<00:04:49.210> master<00:04:49.570> these<00:04:49.750> things

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
can't buy a new master these things

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.980 
can't buy a new master these things
unless<00:04:50.560> you<00:04:50.710> have<00:04:50.740> the<00:04:50.890> most<00:04:51.220> recent<00:04:51.990> unit

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
unless you have the most recent unit

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.659 
unless you have the most recent unit
which<00:04:53.290> you<00:04:53.590> should<00:04:53.830> need<00:04:54.040> new<00:04:54.250> maps<00:04:54.460> for

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669 
which you should need new maps for

00:04:54.669 --> 00:05:00.480 
which you should need new maps for
anyways<00:04:55.090> so<00:04:57.900> the<00:04:58.900> setup<00:04:59.229> works<00:04:59.410> good<00:04:59.710> the<00:05:00.070> GPS

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
anyways so the setup works good the GPS

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
anyways so the setup works good the GPS
not<00:05:01.120> so<00:05:01.330> much<00:05:01.620> I<00:05:02.789> like<00:05:03.789> it<00:05:04.000> makes<00:05:04.300> getting

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:04.510 
not so much I like it makes getting

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:07.020 
not so much I like it makes getting
around<00:05:05.050> places<00:05:05.890> I<00:05:05.950> haven't<00:05:06.130> been<00:05:06.310> before<00:05:06.550> a

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
around places I haven't been before a

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:11.550 
around places I haven't been before a
lot<00:05:07.600> easier<00:05:08.580> and<00:05:09.580> it's<00:05:10.210> ideal<00:05:10.990> for<00:05:11.020> running

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
lot easier and it's ideal for running

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.620 
lot easier and it's ideal for running
around<00:05:11.919> in<00:05:12.070> city<00:05:12.310> speeds<00:05:12.729> because<00:05:13.030> you<00:05:13.450> can

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630 
around in city speeds because you can

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.510 
around in city speeds because you can
still<00:05:13.870> hear<00:05:14.169> the<00:05:14.320> thing<00:05:14.500> too<00:05:14.710> if<00:05:14.919> you<00:05:15.039> even<00:05:15.160> if

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
still hear the thing too if you even if

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.130 
still hear the thing too if you even if
you<00:05:15.610> can't<00:05:15.820> see<00:05:15.880> it<00:05:16.030> because<00:05:16.210> it's<00:05:16.539> washed<00:05:16.720> out

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:19.140 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:23.370 

install<00:05:20.140> was<00:05:20.320> easy<00:05:21.330> just<00:05:22.330> wire<00:05:22.660> it<00:05:22.840> up<00:05:22.930> hide

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:23.380 
install was easy just wire it up hide

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:26.969 
install was easy just wire it up hide
