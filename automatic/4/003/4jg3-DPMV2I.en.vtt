00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
overcook now your rice and beans would

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.240 
overcook now your rice and beans would
have<00:03:30.239> done<00:03:30.390> just<00:03:30.690> as<00:03:30.840> soon<00:03:31.080> is<00:03:31.620> they're<00:03:31.890> nice

have done just as soon is they're nice
and<00:03:32.280> soft<00:03:32.790> and<00:03:33.150> the<00:03:33.239> texture<00:03:33.629> you<00:03:33.750> want<00:03:33.900> I'm

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
and soft and the texture you want I'm

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.530 
and soft and the texture you want I'm
not<00:03:34.500> really<00:03:34.830> adding<00:03:35.340> much<00:03:35.489> flavoring<00:03:36.120> to<00:03:36.360> them

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
not really adding much flavoring to them

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.949 
not really adding much flavoring to them
because<00:03:37.470> they're<00:03:38.069> gonna<00:03:38.280> be<00:03:38.610> really<00:03:39.360> used<00:03:39.720> to

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
because they're gonna be really used to

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.789 
because they're gonna be really used to
soak<00:03:40.200> up<00:03:40.349> all<00:03:40.470> this<00:03:40.680> sauce<00:03:40.980> from<00:03:41.519> the<00:03:41.579> fish<00:03:42.090> I

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
soak up all this sauce from the fish I

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:45.140 
soak up all this sauce from the fish I
think<00:03:43.799> they're<00:03:44.220> done<00:03:44.340> so<00:03:44.579> I'm<00:03:44.700> going<00:03:44.940> to<00:03:45.000> turn
