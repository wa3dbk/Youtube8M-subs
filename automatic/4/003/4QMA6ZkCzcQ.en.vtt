00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
here guys in today's video I'm going to

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.510 
here guys in today's video I'm going to
be<00:00:12.480> showing<00:00:12.719> you<00:00:12.930> some<00:00:13.170> tips<00:00:13.500> and<00:00:13.740> tricks<00:00:14.010> that

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:14.520 
be showing you some tips and tricks that

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.179 
be showing you some tips and tricks that
will<00:00:14.549> make<00:00:14.760> you<00:00:14.940> faster<00:00:15.480> at<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.930> 4x4<00:00:16.590> using

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:17.189 
will make you faster at the 4x4 using

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:19.040 
will make you faster at the 4x4 using
the<00:00:17.279> Yale<00:00:17.550> method<00:00:18.000> and<00:00:18.420> it<00:00:18.509> make<00:00:18.689> it<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:18.900> bit

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
the Yale method and it make it a bit

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.850 
the Yale method and it make it a bit
easier<00:00:19.380> for<00:00:19.439> you<00:00:19.650> guys<00:00:19.680> to<00:00:19.890> solve<00:00:20.310> it<00:00:21.590> so<00:00:22.590> first

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:22.860 
easier for you guys to solve it so first

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.679 
easier for you guys to solve it so first
of<00:00:23.040> all<00:00:23.130> you<00:00:23.550> obviously<00:00:23.640> need<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.119> be<00:00:24.270> able<00:00:24.570> to

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
of all you obviously need to be able to

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.889 
of all you obviously need to be able to
solve<00:00:24.930> a<00:00:25.020> 4x4<00:00:25.739> using<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.460> yawl<00:00:26.610> method<00:00:27.029> if<00:00:27.840> you

00:00:27.889 --> 00:00:27.899 
solve a 4x4 using the yawl method if you

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:29.720 
solve a 4x4 using the yawl method if you
don't<00:00:28.230> know<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.529> are<00:00:28.680> method<00:00:29.070> I<00:00:29.250> recommend

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
don't know the are method I recommend

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
video I also recommend that you are

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.120 
video I also recommend that you are
confident<00:00:36.690> with<00:00:36.780> y'all<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.380> can<00:00:37.530> get<00:00:37.680> solves

confident with y'all and can get solves

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.970 
confident with y'all and can get solves
sub<00:00:38.489> 2<00:00:38.700> minutes<00:00:39.090> otherwise<00:00:39.630> this<00:00:40.350> video<00:00:40.680> might

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
sub 2 minutes otherwise this video might

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.220 
sub 2 minutes otherwise this video might
confuse<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.670> little<00:00:42.000> bit<00:00:44.300> ok<00:00:45.300> so<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.960> first

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
confuse you a little bit ok so the first

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.470 
confuse you a little bit ok so the first
useful<00:00:46.830> kind<00:00:47.010> of<00:00:47.160> tip<00:00:47.340> our<00:00:47.520> trick<00:00:47.910> is<00:00:48.150> when<00:00:48.360> we

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
useful kind of tip our trick is when we

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.390 
useful kind of tip our trick is when we
have<00:00:48.570> already<00:00:48.810> built<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.440> first<00:00:49.680> 2<00:00:49.920> centers

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:50.400 
have already built the first 2 centers

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.970 
have already built the first 2 centers
and<00:00:50.700> three<00:00:51.240> white<00:00:51.570> edges<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.770> we<00:00:52.890> are

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
and three white edges and we are

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.090 
and three white edges and we are
starting<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.550> solve<00:00:53.790> the<00:00:54.000> last<00:00:54.240> four<00:00:54.510> centers

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
starting to solve the last four centers

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.710 
starting to solve the last four centers
now<00:00:56.100> this<00:00:56.310> is<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.730> most<00:00:56.910> difficult<00:00:57.450> part<00:00:57.660> of

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:57.720 
now this is the most difficult part of

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.050 
now this is the most difficult part of
the<00:00:57.870> our<00:00:58.020> method<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.650> for<00:00:59.250> most<00:00:59.430> people<00:00:59.550> it

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:00.060 
the our method and for most people it

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.690 
the our method and for most people it
takes<00:01:00.360> the<00:01:00.600> most<00:01:00.780> amount<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.380> time<00:01:01.460> so<00:01:02.460> what<00:01:02.610> we

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:02.700 
takes the most amount of time so what we

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.460 
takes the most amount of time so what we
can<00:01:02.850> do<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.300> speed<00:01:03.600> this<00:01:03.660> part<00:01:04.049> of<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.259> solve

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
can do to speed this part of the solve

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.210 
can do to speed this part of the solve
up<00:01:04.710> is<00:01:04.890> we<00:01:05.430> can<00:01:05.610> move<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.150> white<00:01:06.329> side<00:01:06.829> as<00:01:07.829> well

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
up is we can move the white side as well

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.580 
up is we can move the white side as well
as<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.700> yellow<00:01:08.909> side<00:01:09.240> as<00:01:10.049> long<00:01:10.259> as<00:01:10.380> we<00:01:10.470> don't

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
as the yellow side as long as we don't

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.380 
as the yellow side as long as we don't
mess<00:01:10.890> up<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.280> edges<00:01:11.670> we<00:01:11.820> have<00:01:11.909> already<00:01:12.090> made

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
mess up the edges we have already made

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.350 
mess up the edges we have already made
so<00:01:13.260> instead<00:01:13.470> of<00:01:13.530> only<00:01:13.860> using<00:01:14.220> these<00:01:15.030> three

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
so instead of only using these three

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.580 
so instead of only using these three
layers<00:01:15.870> and<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:17.130> U<00:01:17.370> layer<00:01:17.810> we<00:01:18.810> can<00:01:19.020> turn<00:01:19.320> the

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
layers and the U layer we can turn the

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.860 
layers and the U layer we can turn the
white<00:01:19.770> layer<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:20.370> we<00:01:20.400> can<00:01:20.490> free<00:01:21.000> up<00:01:21.030> different

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:21.870 
white layer so we can free up different

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.370 
white layer so we can free up different
layers<00:01:22.080> such<00:01:22.409> as<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.710> F<00:01:22.890> layer<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:24.200> the<00:01:25.200> back

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
layers such as the F layer and the back

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.420 
layers such as the F layer and the back
layer<00:01:27.350> it<00:01:28.350> does<00:01:28.650> take<00:01:28.920> quite<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.220> lot<00:01:29.370> of

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
layer it does take quite a lot of

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:30.770 
layer it does take quite a lot of
getting<00:01:29.610> used<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:30.390> will<00:01:30.600> probably

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
getting used to and you will probably

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.690 
getting used to and you will probably
slow<00:01:31.260> down<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.500> bit<00:01:31.770> when<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:32.010> first<00:01:32.340> try<00:01:32.670> it

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
slow down a bit when you first try it

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.430 
slow down a bit when you first try it
but<00:01:33.060> it<00:01:33.150> really<00:01:33.390> does<00:01:33.720> help<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.110> it<00:01:34.260> makes

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
but it really does help and it makes

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.260 
but it really does help and it makes
such<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.710> big<00:01:34.830> difference<00:01:35.220> than<00:01:35.610> just<00:01:35.850> move<00:01:36.060> in

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
such a big difference than just move in

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.960 
such a big difference than just move in
the<00:01:36.390> art<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.960> new<00:01:37.140> layers<00:01:37.380> so<00:01:38.159> for<00:01:38.310> example<00:01:38.760> if

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
the art and new layers so for example if

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.520 
the art and new layers so for example if
I<00:01:39.090> wanted<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.479> match<00:01:39.630> this<00:01:39.900> piece<00:01:40.170> up<00:01:40.380> with

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
I wanted to match this piece up with

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.130 
I wanted to match this piece up with
this<00:01:40.680> piece<00:01:40.950> I<00:01:41.250> would<00:01:41.580> have<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.909> move<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.930> r

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
this piece I would have to move the r

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.430 
this piece I would have to move the r
layer<00:01:43.350> up<00:01:43.820> turn<00:01:44.820> it<00:01:44.850> back<00:01:45.840> down<00:01:46.110> again

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
layer up turn it back down again

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.219 
layer up turn it back down again
and<00:01:46.619> then<00:01:46.799> match<00:01:47.010> up<00:01:47.360> was<00:01:48.360> what<00:01:48.600> we<00:01:48.690> could<00:01:48.960> do

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
and then match up was what we could do

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.679 
and then match up was what we could do
to<00:01:50.159> much<00:01:50.310> this<00:01:50.549> it<00:01:50.729> with<00:01:50.850> this<00:01:51.030> is<00:01:51.360> we<00:01:51.540> could

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
to much this it with this is we could

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.010 
to much this it with this is we could
move<00:01:51.869> this<00:01:52.110> layer<00:01:52.320> down<00:01:53.330> make<00:01:54.330> it<00:01:54.450> an<00:01:54.570> F<00:01:54.750> so

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
move this layer down make it an F so

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.399 
move this layer down make it an F so
we're<00:01:55.170> not<00:01:55.380> messing<00:01:55.619> up<00:01:55.890> these<00:01:56.220> pieces<00:01:57.409> then

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
we're not messing up these pieces then

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.380 
we're not messing up these pieces then
match<00:01:58.650> them<00:01:58.860> up<00:01:59.010> so<00:01:59.580> we<00:01:59.670> have<00:01:59.850> these<00:02:00.090> edges

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
match them up so we have these edges

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.200 
match them up so we have these edges
still<00:02:00.900> built<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:02.040> we<00:02:02.280> have<00:02:02.460> these<00:02:02.909> now

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
still built and we have these now

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.200 
still built and we have these now
matched<00:02:03.479> up<00:02:04.070> so<00:02:05.070> instead<00:02:05.220> of<00:02:05.520> having<00:02:05.729> to<00:02:05.880> move

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
matched up so instead of having to move

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.770 
matched up so instead of having to move
the<00:02:06.990> whole<00:02:07.170> 3<00:02:07.710> R<00:02:07.950> layers<00:02:08.250> we<00:02:09.060> can<00:02:09.090> simply<00:02:09.599> move

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
the whole 3 R layers we can simply move

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.410 
the whole 3 R layers we can simply move
the<00:02:10.019> L<00:02:10.200> heir<00:02:10.470> who<00:02:11.099> as<00:02:11.280> we<00:02:11.310> need<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:11.790> do<00:02:11.939> and<00:02:12.209> then

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
the L heir who as we need to do and then

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.250 
the L heir who as we need to do and then
move<00:02:12.599> it<00:02:12.750> back<00:02:12.780> so<00:02:14.629> the<00:02:15.629> next<00:02:15.870> tip<00:02:16.049> for<00:02:16.200> you

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
move it back so the next tip for you

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.170 
move it back so the next tip for you
guys<00:02:16.290> is<00:02:16.530> when<00:02:17.010> we<00:02:17.159> are<00:02:17.279> making<00:02:17.430> the<00:02:17.790> last

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
guys is when we are making the last

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.470 
guys is when we are making the last
white<00:02:18.659> edge<00:02:19.129> now<00:02:20.129> normally<00:02:20.700> when<00:02:21.060> we<00:02:21.150> make<00:02:21.329> the

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
white edge now normally when we make the

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.820 
white edge now normally when we make the
first

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
first

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.160 
first
three<00:02:22.070> edges<00:02:22.490> we<00:02:22.730> put<00:02:22.970> two<00:02:23.300> of<00:02:23.330> them<00:02:23.690> in<00:02:23.900> the

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
three edges we put two of them in the

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.440 
three edges we put two of them in the
right<00:02:24.380> place<00:02:24.710> and<00:02:25.070> the<00:02:25.460> third<00:02:25.760> one<00:02:26.030> in<00:02:26.270> the

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
right place and the third one in the

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.840 
right place and the third one in the
wrong<00:02:26.660> place<00:02:26.960> so<00:02:27.830> we<00:02:27.950> can<00:02:28.070> put<00:02:28.280> in<00:02:28.430> the<00:02:28.520> fourth

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
wrong place so we can put in the fourth

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.680 
wrong place so we can put in the fourth
one<00:02:29.120> without<00:02:29.690> a<00:02:29.870> problem<00:02:30.730> but<00:02:31.730> we<00:02:31.880> can<00:02:32.180> put<00:02:32.450> all

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
one without a problem but we can put all

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.870 
one without a problem but we can put all
three<00:02:33.230> of<00:02:33.350> the<00:02:33.470> first<00:02:33.740> white<00:02:34.010> edges<00:02:34.460> in<00:02:34.610> the

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
three of the first white edges in the

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.810 
three of the first white edges in the
right<00:02:35.090> place<00:02:35.450> and<00:02:36.380> I'll<00:02:36.440> show<00:02:36.680> you<00:02:36.710> why<00:02:37.040> so<00:02:37.760> I'm

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
right place and I'll show you why so I'm

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.450 
right place and I'll show you why so I'm
going<00:02:37.940> to<00:02:37.970> put<00:02:38.210> this<00:02:38.360> orange<00:02:38.780> one<00:02:39.370> into<00:02:40.370> the

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
going to put this orange one into the

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.840 
going to put this orange one into the
correct<00:02:40.790> place<00:02:41.680> so<00:02:42.680> now<00:02:42.950> we<00:02:43.010> don't<00:02:43.280> remember

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
correct place so now we don't remember

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.920 
correct place so now we don't remember
which<00:02:44.270> edge<00:02:44.540> is<00:02:44.900> in<00:02:45.080> the<00:02:45.110> wrong<00:02:45.350> place<00:02:46.930> now

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
which edge is in the wrong place now

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.630 
which edge is in the wrong place now
normally<00:02:48.410> what<00:02:48.560> we<00:02:48.740> would<00:02:48.860> do<00:02:49.070> is<00:02:49.490> we<00:02:49.610> would

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
normally what we would do is we would

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.510 
normally what we would do is we would
settle<00:02:50.060> the<00:02:50.300> last<00:02:50.540> white<00:02:50.810> edge<00:02:51.050> like<00:02:51.620> so<00:02:51.650> and

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
settle the last white edge like so and

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.670 
settle the last white edge like so and
then<00:02:52.760> slice<00:02:53.120> but<00:02:53.930> because<00:02:54.200> we<00:02:54.290> put<00:02:54.470> them<00:02:54.590> all

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
then slice but because we put them all

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.140 
then slice but because we put them all
in<00:02:54.830> the<00:02:54.860> right<00:02:55.100> place<00:02:55.460> that's<00:02:55.730> not<00:02:55.970> going<00:02:56.090> to

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
in the right place that's not going to

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.970 
in the right place that's not going to
work<00:02:56.210> anymore

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
work anymore

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:03.090 
work anymore
so<00:02:57.980> what<00:02:58.160> we<00:02:58.280> do<00:02:58.400> instead<00:02:58.850> is<00:02:59.620> we<00:03:00.620> slice<00:03:01.190> first

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
so what we do instead is we slice first

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.630 
so what we do instead is we slice first
then<00:03:04.100> put<00:03:04.370> in<00:03:04.490> the<00:03:04.520> edge<00:03:04.730> and<00:03:05.480> slice<00:03:05.750> back<00:03:06.050> and

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
then put in the edge and slice back and

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.370 
then put in the edge and slice back and
then<00:03:07.640> we<00:03:08.060> can<00:03:08.209> just<00:03:08.330> simply<00:03:08.690> move<00:03:08.930> up<00:03:09.110> the<00:03:09.230> edge

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
then we can just simply move up the edge

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.970 
then we can just simply move up the edge
without<00:03:09.830> messing<00:03:10.100> up<00:03:10.400> any<00:03:10.670> of<00:03:10.880> the<00:03:11.270> center's

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
without messing up any of the center's

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.430 
without messing up any of the center's
this<00:03:12.980> is<00:03:13.130> a<00:03:13.160> lot<00:03:13.459> easier<00:03:13.750> than<00:03:14.750> putting<00:03:15.050> in<00:03:15.260> one

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
this is a lot easier than putting in one

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.050 
this is a lot easier than putting in one
wrong<00:03:15.650> edge<00:03:15.890> because<00:03:16.400> we<00:03:16.520> don't<00:03:16.790> have<00:03:16.880> to

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
wrong edge because we don't have to

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.080 
wrong edge because we don't have to
remember<00:03:17.330> which<00:03:17.750> edge<00:03:17.959> is<00:03:18.200> wrong<00:03:18.940> and<00:03:19.940> it

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
remember which edge is wrong and it

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.240 
remember which edge is wrong and it
saves<00:03:20.420> us<00:03:20.720> having<00:03:20.750> to<00:03:21.140> move<00:03:21.440> out<00:03:21.709> any<00:03:21.980> other

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
saves us having to move out any other

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.100 
saves us having to move out any other
edges<00:03:22.670> and<00:03:22.910> we<00:03:22.970> can<00:03:23.120> just<00:03:23.270> put<00:03:23.480> it<00:03:23.570> in<00:03:23.690> without

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
edges and we can just put it in without

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.660 
edges and we can just put it in without
a<00:03:24.140> problem<00:03:26.500> so<00:03:27.500> the<00:03:27.709> next<00:03:27.890> part<00:03:28.130> is<00:03:28.430> edge

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
a problem so the next part is edge

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.570 
a problem so the next part is edge
paring<00:03:29.239> and<00:03:29.390> this<00:03:29.690> concerns<00:03:30.140> look<00:03:30.440> ahead<00:03:30.739> now

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:31.580 
paring and this concerns look ahead now

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.880 
paring and this concerns look ahead now
this<00:03:31.790> comes<00:03:32.030> naturally<00:03:32.750> with<00:03:32.930> practice<00:03:33.500> so

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
this comes naturally with practice so

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:35.560 
this comes naturally with practice so
many<00:03:34.160> of<00:03:34.310> you<00:03:34.430> will<00:03:34.610> probably<00:03:34.820> use<00:03:35.390> this

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
many of you will probably use this

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:38.770 
many of you will probably use this
already<00:03:36.190> but<00:03:37.190> the<00:03:37.340> idea<00:03:37.670> is<00:03:37.910> that<00:03:38.239> as<00:03:38.390> you<00:03:38.570> put

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
already but the idea is that as you put

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.860 
already but the idea is that as you put
in<00:03:39.019> each<00:03:39.260> edge<00:03:39.650> for<00:03:40.190> edge<00:03:40.340> pairing<00:03:40.850> you<00:03:41.600> look

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
in each edge for edge pairing you look

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.870 
in each edge for edge pairing you look
for<00:03:42.110> the<00:03:42.170> next<00:03:42.470> piece<00:03:42.739> after<00:03:43.100> the<00:03:43.489> one<00:03:43.670> you<00:03:43.790> are

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
for the next piece after the one you are

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.210 
for the next piece after the one you are
putting<00:03:44.090> in<00:03:44.390> so<00:03:45.350> for<00:03:45.560> example<00:03:45.920> I'm<00:03:46.010> going<00:03:46.160> to

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
putting in so for example I'm going to

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.270 
putting in so for example I'm going to
start<00:03:46.519> with<00:03:46.940> the<00:03:47.300> green<00:03:47.330> and<00:03:48.019> orange<00:03:48.410> so<00:03:49.250> I

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
start with the green and orange so I

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.699 
start with the green and orange so I
find<00:03:49.640> that<00:03:49.790> edge<00:03:50.030> which<00:03:50.300> is<00:03:50.450> up<00:03:50.600> here<00:03:50.650> and<00:03:51.650> I

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
find that edge which is up here and I

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.190 
find that edge which is up here and I
see<00:03:51.980> the<00:03:52.100> piece<00:03:52.280> next<00:03:52.610> to<00:03:52.820> it<00:03:53.000> which<00:03:53.720> is<00:03:53.930> red

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
see the piece next to it which is red

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:54.940 
see the piece next to it which is red
green

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
green

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.580 
green
so<00:03:55.940> as<00:03:56.180> I'm<00:03:56.330> putting<00:03:56.540> in<00:03:56.840> this<00:03:57.050> edge<00:03:57.320> I'm

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
so as I'm putting in this edge I'm

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.650 
so as I'm putting in this edge I'm
looking<00:03:58.070> for<00:03:58.250> the<00:03:58.340> red<00:03:58.519> and<00:03:58.820> green<00:03:58.940> and<00:03:59.630> I

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
looking for the red and green and I

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.160 
looking for the red and green and I
found<00:04:00.019> it<00:04:00.200> here<00:04:01.030> so<00:04:02.030> then<00:04:02.180> I<00:04:02.300> look<00:04:02.540> for<00:04:02.930> the<00:04:03.019> red

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
found it here so then I look for the red

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:04.900 
found it here so then I look for the red
and<00:04:03.350> green<00:04:03.440> I've<00:04:03.800> found<00:04:04.130> it<00:04:04.280> here<00:04:04.550> and<00:04:04.790> the

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
and green I've found it here and the

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.840 
and green I've found it here and the
piece<00:04:05.150> next<00:04:05.570> to<00:04:05.690> it<00:04:05.840> is<00:04:06.019> orange<00:04:06.590> and<00:04:06.739> yellow<00:04:06.920> so

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
piece next to it is orange and yellow so

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.790 
piece next to it is orange and yellow so
as<00:04:08.090> I'm<00:04:08.209> putting<00:04:08.420> in<00:04:08.750> the<00:04:08.930> red<00:04:09.200> and<00:04:09.350> green<00:04:09.470> edge

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
as I'm putting in the red and green edge

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.660 
as I'm putting in the red and green edge
I'm<00:04:10.040> looking<00:04:10.610> for<00:04:10.880> the<00:04:10.970> orange<00:04:11.360> and<00:04:11.630> yellow<00:04:11.810> I

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
I'm looking for the orange and yellow I

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.949 
I'm looking for the orange and yellow I
found<00:04:13.670> it<00:04:13.790> over<00:04:13.850> here<00:04:14.000> and<00:04:14.269> it<00:04:14.390> just<00:04:14.600> happens

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
found it over here and it just happens

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:17.830 
found it over here and it just happens
that<00:04:15.019> it<00:04:15.200> is<00:04:15.350> already<00:04:15.620> in<00:04:15.890> the<00:04:16.010> right<00:04:16.130> place<00:04:16.840> so

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
that it is already in the right place so

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.469 
that it is already in the right place so
we<00:04:17.959> match<00:04:18.200> up<00:04:18.410> and<00:04:18.769> it<00:04:19.729> works<00:04:20.000> on<00:04:20.120> the<00:04:20.180> way<00:04:20.299> back

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 
we match up and it works on the way back

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:23.230 
we match up and it works on the way back
as<00:04:20.690> well<00:04:20.900> so<00:04:21.140> I<00:04:21.290> see<00:04:21.650> the<00:04:21.950> blue<00:04:22.190> and<00:04:22.430> orange<00:04:22.640> so

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
as well so I see the blue and orange so

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.670 
as well so I see the blue and orange so
I<00:04:23.270> look<00:04:23.540> for<00:04:23.690> the<00:04:23.750> blue<00:04:23.900> and<00:04:23.930> orange<00:04:24.169> and<00:04:24.500> it's

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
I look for the blue and orange and it's

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.090 
I look for the blue and orange and it's
here

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
here

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.270 
here
so<00:04:25.790> as<00:04:25.910> I'm<00:04:26.030> putting<00:04:26.240> it<00:04:26.450> in<00:04:26.600> I<00:04:26.870> see<00:04:27.680> the<00:04:28.040> blue

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
so as I'm putting it in I see the blue

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.980 
so as I'm putting it in I see the blue
and<00:04:28.460> yellow<00:04:28.580> so<00:04:29.030> I'm<00:04:29.150> looking<00:04:29.540> for<00:04:29.720> the<00:04:29.810> blue

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
and yellow so I'm looking for the blue

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.460 
and yellow so I'm looking for the blue
and<00:04:30.140> yellow<00:04:30.260> as<00:04:30.590> well<00:04:31.479> so<00:04:32.479> as<00:04:32.630> that<00:04:32.750> goes<00:04:32.960> in<00:04:33.260> I

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
and yellow as well so as that goes in I

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:34.240 
and yellow as well so as that goes in I
found

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
found

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.670 
found
and<00:04:34.460> yellow<00:04:34.610> hair<00:04:34.970> and<00:04:35.240> I<00:04:35.840> see<00:04:36.110> that<00:04:36.230> next<00:04:36.500> to

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
and yellow hair and I see that next to

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.490 
and yellow hair and I see that next to
blue<00:04:36.860> and<00:04:36.980> yellow<00:04:37.100> we<00:04:37.670> have<00:04:37.850> blue<00:04:38.090> and<00:04:38.240> iron

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
blue and yellow we have blue and iron

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.400 
blue and yellow we have blue and iron
red<00:04:39.500> so<00:04:40.010> I<00:04:40.040> put<00:04:40.310> that<00:04:40.340> in<00:04:40.690> and<00:04:41.690> I<00:04:41.720> find<00:04:42.110> the<00:04:42.230> blue

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
red so I put that in and I find the blue

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.170 
red so I put that in and I find the blue
and<00:04:42.560> edge<00:04:42.680> of<00:04:42.830> hair<00:04:43.040> and<00:04:43.370> I<00:04:43.520> put<00:04:43.760> that<00:04:43.880> one<00:04:44.060> in

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
and edge of hair and I put that one in

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.570 
and edge of hair and I put that one in
then<00:04:45.140> when<00:04:45.320> we<00:04:45.440> match<00:04:45.710> up<00:04:45.740> the<00:04:46.010> edges<00:04:46.310> again

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
then when we match up the edges again

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.910 
then when we match up the edges again
it's<00:04:47.150> done<00:04:47.390> and<00:04:47.810> then<00:04:48.200> we<00:04:48.290> have<00:04:48.440> the<00:04:48.590> last<00:04:48.770> two

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:48.920 
it's done and then we have the last two

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:54.250 
it's done and then we have the last two
edges<00:04:49.400> to<00:04:49.550> do<00:04:51.310> so<00:04:52.310> it<00:04:52.760> is<00:04:53.180> quite<00:04:53.690> hard<00:04:53.960> to<00:04:54.080> get

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
edges to do so it is quite hard to get

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.350 
edges to do so it is quite hard to get
the<00:04:54.350> hang<00:04:54.530> of<00:04:54.710> and<00:04:54.920> you<00:04:55.160> might<00:04:55.460> slow<00:04:55.820> down<00:04:55.850> to

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 
the hang of and you might slow down to

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.320 
the hang of and you might slow down to
start<00:04:56.750> with<00:04:57.080> but<00:04:57.920> it<00:04:58.130> makes<00:04:58.430> a<00:04:58.550> big<00:04:58.790> difference

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
start with but it makes a big difference

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.270 
start with but it makes a big difference
so<00:04:59.510> I'm<00:04:59.630> just<00:04:59.780> stopping<00:05:00.140> and<00:05:00.590> looking<00:05:00.830> for

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
so I'm just stopping and looking for

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.130 
so I'm just stopping and looking for
another<00:05:01.490> edge<00:05:01.760> and<00:05:02.120> you<00:05:02.240> are<00:05:02.450> thinking<00:05:02.960> all

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.140 
another edge and you are thinking all

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:05.740 
another edge and you are thinking all
the<00:05:03.500> time<00:05:03.770> it<00:05:04.310> does<00:05:04.580> really<00:05:04.910> help<00:05:05.210> to<00:05:05.540> fill

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
the time it does really help to fill

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.170 
the time it does really help to fill
those<00:05:05.900> gaps<00:05:05.960> when<00:05:06.470> you<00:05:06.590> aren't<00:05:06.830> moving<00:05:07.130> so<00:05:08.060> it

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
those gaps when you aren't moving so it

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:11.950 
those gaps when you aren't moving so it
is<00:05:08.270> really<00:05:08.750> really<00:05:08.870> useful<00:05:09.440> to<00:05:09.590> do<00:05:10.690> so<00:05:11.690> the

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
is really really useful to do so the

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.420 
is really really useful to do so the
last<00:05:12.140> tip<00:05:12.410> that<00:05:12.710> I<00:05:12.740> have<00:05:12.830> for<00:05:13.010> you<00:05:13.220> guys<00:05:13.370> is

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
last tip that I have for you guys is

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.360 
last tip that I have for you guys is
also<00:05:14.360> joint<00:05:14.720> edge<00:05:14.930> paring<00:05:15.350> and<00:05:15.950> this<00:05:16.100> is<00:05:16.220> when

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
also joint edge paring and this is when

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.610 
also joint edge paring and this is when
you<00:05:16.520> need<00:05:16.700> an<00:05:16.910> edge<00:05:17.180> that<00:05:17.600> is<00:05:17.690> already<00:05:18.170> in<00:05:18.290> use

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
you need an edge that is already in use

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.970 
you need an edge that is already in use
while<00:05:19.130> trying<00:05:19.460> to<00:05:19.580> pair<00:05:19.790> up<00:05:20.050> so<00:05:21.050> for<00:05:21.260> example<00:05:21.770> I

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:21.980 
while trying to pair up so for example I

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.550 
while trying to pair up so for example I
want<00:05:22.400> to<00:05:22.520> start<00:05:22.940> by<00:05:23.330> matching<00:05:23.660> up<00:05:23.960> the<00:05:24.230> orange

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 
want to start by matching up the orange

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.220 
want to start by matching up the orange
and<00:05:24.680> blue<00:05:24.890> so<00:05:25.820> I<00:05:25.910> find<00:05:26.270> the<00:05:26.570> orange<00:05:26.900> and<00:05:27.050> blue

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:27.230 
and blue so I find the orange and blue

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:30.030 
and blue so I find the orange and blue
edge<00:05:27.380> which<00:05:27.680> is<00:05:27.710> up<00:05:27.950> here<00:05:27.980> so<00:05:28.820> I<00:05:28.910> put<00:05:29.120> it<00:05:29.210> down

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:30.040 
edge which is up here so I put it down

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.100 
edge which is up here so I put it down
then<00:05:31.040> I<00:05:31.130> see<00:05:31.340> the<00:05:31.460> next<00:05:31.610> edge<00:05:31.910> which<00:05:32.660> is<00:05:32.690> red

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:33.110 
then I see the next edge which is red

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.130 
then I see the next edge which is red
and<00:05:33.320> blue<00:05:33.560> so<00:05:34.370> I<00:05:34.400> find<00:05:34.790> the<00:05:35.060> red<00:05:35.300> and<00:05:35.630> blue<00:05:35.840> but

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:36.140 
and blue so I find the red and blue but

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:39.550 
and blue so I find the red and blue but
that's<00:05:36.740> down<00:05:36.890> here<00:05:37.570> and<00:05:38.570> we<00:05:38.690> can't<00:05:38.990> use<00:05:39.110> this

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 
that's down here and we can't use this

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:41.500 
that's down here and we can't use this
edge<00:05:39.800> because<00:05:40.340> we're<00:05:40.490> already<00:05:40.730> using<00:05:41.210> it<00:05:41.360> to

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:41.510 
edge because we're already using it to

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:45.040 
edge because we're already using it to
match<00:05:41.690> up<00:05:41.870> these<00:05:42.020> two<00:05:42.290> edges<00:05:43.419> so<00:05:44.419> what<00:05:44.720> we<00:05:44.840> can

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
match up these two edges so what we can

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.970 
match up these two edges so what we can
do<00:05:45.410> is<00:05:46.040> we<00:05:46.640> can<00:05:46.820> push<00:05:47.180> this<00:05:47.690> piece<00:05:48.020> away<00:05:48.320> from

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:48.980 
do is we can push this piece away from

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:52.000 
do is we can push this piece away from
the<00:05:49.100> edge<00:05:49.250> that<00:05:49.520> we're<00:05:49.640> using<00:05:50.740> then<00:05:51.740> what<00:05:51.890> we

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.010 
the edge that we're using then what we

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:54.719 
the edge that we're using then what we
do<00:05:52.160> is<00:05:52.400> we<00:05:52.580> replace<00:05:52.760> it<00:05:53.300> with<00:05:53.540> a<00:05:53.570> broken<00:05:54.229> edge

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:54.729 
do is we replace it with a broken edge

00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:57.820 
do is we replace it with a broken edge
so<00:05:55.729> now<00:05:55.940> it's<00:05:56.090> in<00:05:56.210> the<00:05:56.300> top<00:05:56.510> layer<00:05:56.720> then<00:05:57.710> we

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:57.830 
so now it's in the top layer then we

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.360 
so now it's in the top layer then we
push<00:05:58.130> the<00:05:58.370> layer<00:05:58.550> back<00:05:59.919> so<00:06:00.919> we<00:06:01.040> still<00:06:01.250> have

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:01.370 
push the layer back so we still have

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.130 
push the layer back so we still have
these<00:06:01.520> two<00:06:01.790> matched<00:06:02.030> up<00:06:02.330> and<00:06:02.630> we<00:06:02.720> still<00:06:03.020> have

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:03.140 
these two matched up and we still have

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:07.000 
these two matched up and we still have
this<00:06:03.260> piece<00:06:03.560> up<00:06:03.800> here<00:06:04.930> so<00:06:05.930> then<00:06:06.380> we<00:06:06.500> find<00:06:06.830> the

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:07.010 
this piece up here so then we find the

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:09.790 
this piece up here so then we find the
piece<00:06:07.250> and<00:06:08.210> we<00:06:08.479> can<00:06:08.660> continue<00:06:09.260> with<00:06:09.560> edge

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:09.800 
piece and we can continue with edge

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:12.520 
piece and we can continue with edge
pairing<00:06:10.250> as<00:06:10.940> you<00:06:11.060> can<00:06:11.180> see<00:06:11.450> now<00:06:12.080> we<00:06:12.140> have<00:06:12.229> these

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:12.530 
pairing as you can see now we have these

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:16.659 
pairing as you can see now we have these
two<00:06:12.590> which<00:06:13.070> can<00:06:13.310> easily<00:06:13.580> match<00:06:14.180> up<00:06:15.610> now<00:06:16.610> do

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:16.669 
two which can easily match up now do

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:20.110 
two which can easily match up now do
bear<00:06:17.270> in<00:06:17.450> mind<00:06:17.750> that<00:06:18.650> we<00:06:18.890> can<00:06:19.040> only<00:06:19.280> do<00:06:19.610> this<00:06:19.880> on

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:20.120 
bear in mind that we can only do this on

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.260 
bear in mind that we can only do this on
the<00:06:20.360> first<00:06:20.660> three<00:06:21.320> edges<00:06:21.970> when<00:06:22.970> we're<00:06:23.120> doing

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:23.270 
the first three edges when we're doing

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.320 
the first three edges when we're doing
the<00:06:23.570> slice<00:06:23.930> first<00:06:24.500> if<00:06:25.250> we<00:06:25.490> do<00:06:25.610> it<00:06:25.729> on<00:06:25.880> the

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:26.330 
the slice first if we do it on the

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.810 
the slice first if we do it on the
second<00:06:27.050> set<00:06:27.710> of<00:06:27.740> three<00:06:28.010> edges<00:06:28.370> when<00:06:28.669> we're

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:28.820 
second set of three edges when we're

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.610 
second set of three edges when we're
going<00:06:28.940> to<00:06:29.090> be<00:06:29.180> moving<00:06:29.390> the<00:06:29.510> slice<00:06:29.840> back<00:06:30.169> it

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:30.620 
going to be moving the slice back it

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.219 
going to be moving the slice back it
won't<00:06:31.220> work<00:06:31.520> because<00:06:31.910> we<00:06:32.240> have<00:06:32.270> some<00:06:33.020> Bill

00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:33.229 
won't work because we have some Bill

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:36.700 
won't work because we have some Bill
edges<00:06:33.740> up<00:06:33.919> here<00:06:34.310> already<00:06:34.729> and<00:06:35.320> it<00:06:36.320> will<00:06:36.470> mess

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:36.710 
edges up here already and it will mess

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:38.550 
edges up here already and it will mess
up<00:06:36.740> the<00:06:37.040> edges<00:06:37.490> that<00:06:37.669> we<00:06:37.820> have<00:06:38.030> already<00:06:38.270> made

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:38.560 
up the edges that we have already made

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.380 
up the edges that we have already made
so<00:06:39.560> do<00:06:39.860> need<00:06:40.040> to<00:06:40.130> be<00:06:40.220> careful<00:06:40.430> that<00:06:40.790> we<00:06:40.880> only<00:06:41.120> do

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:41.390 
so do need to be careful that we only do

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:44.409 
so do need to be careful that we only do
it<00:06:41.540> on<00:06:41.570> the<00:06:41.780> first<00:06:41.990> three<00:06:42.590> edges<00:06:43.130> and<00:06:43.340> if<00:06:44.030> we<00:06:44.210> do

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:44.419 
it on the first three edges and if we do

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:45.950 
it on the first three edges and if we do
get<00:06:44.690> that<00:06:44.810> case<00:06:45.110> on<00:06:45.440> the<00:06:45.560> sec

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:45.960 
get that case on the sec

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.320 
get that case on the sec
three<00:06:46.139> edges<00:06:46.470> we<00:06:46.860> do<00:06:47.100> just<00:06:47.460> need<00:06:47.669> to<00:06:47.819> put<00:06:48.000> in<00:06:48.150> a

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:48.330 
three edges we do just need to put in a

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:52.249 
three edges we do just need to put in a
random<00:06:48.569> edge<00:06:50.030> now<00:06:51.030> this<00:06:51.210> does<00:06:51.509> really<00:06:51.870> help

00:06:52.249 --> 00:06:52.259 
random edge now this does really help

00:06:52.259 --> 00:06:53.900 
random edge now this does really help
because<00:06:52.620> it<00:06:52.710> saves<00:06:52.949> us<00:06:53.160> having<00:06:53.460> to<00:06:53.490> put<00:06:53.729> in<00:06:53.759> a

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:53.910 
because it saves us having to put in a

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:55.790 
because it saves us having to put in a
random<00:06:54.090> edge<00:06:54.479> and<00:06:54.840> it<00:06:54.990> saves<00:06:55.199> a<00:06:55.349> lot<00:06:55.380> of<00:06:55.680> time

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:55.800 
random edge and it saves a lot of time

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.460 
random edge and it saves a lot of time
for<00:06:56.460> us<00:06:56.490> having<00:06:56.940> to<00:06:56.970> put<00:06:57.300> in<00:06:57.449> different<00:06:57.900> edges

00:06:58.460 --> 00:06:58.470 
for us having to put in different edges

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:00.920 
for us having to put in different edges
find<00:06:58.979> different<00:06:59.580> edges<00:06:59.970> and<00:07:00.449> then<00:07:00.569> we<00:07:00.660> have<00:07:00.810> to

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:00.930 
find different edges and then we have to

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:04.249 
find different edges and then we have to
do<00:07:01.050> the<00:07:01.199> process<00:07:01.740> different<00:07:02.520> times<00:07:03.110> so<00:07:04.110> it

00:07:04.249 --> 00:07:04.259 
do the process different times so it

00:07:04.259 --> 00:07:06.589 
do the process different times so it
does<00:07:04.470> really<00:07:04.650> help<00:07:04.830> and<00:07:05.340> it's<00:07:06.000> a<00:07:06.090> really

00:07:06.589 --> 00:07:06.599 
does really help and it's a really

00:07:06.599 --> 00:07:08.749 
does really help and it's a really
really<00:07:06.960> good<00:07:07.410> method<00:07:07.979> to<00:07:08.009> get<00:07:08.310> into<00:07:08.490> the<00:07:08.610> habit
