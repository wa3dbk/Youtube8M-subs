00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.549
 that I lived farming yeah I

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.170
 your relationship to mallory fashion to my 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.150
 relationship to fashion beats it maybe comes 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.170
 from my mother I do not know we always have a 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.390
 little bath in the soul 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.729

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.710
 agree and therefore has suffered today 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.840

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.159
