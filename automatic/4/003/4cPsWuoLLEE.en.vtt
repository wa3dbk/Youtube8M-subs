00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:07.859
 concern about improving care 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.210
 with the walker is not just for handlers is 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.950
 presenters 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.960
 proof of this is the increasing 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.590
 of breeders in the promoted courses 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.310
 by addition in two bars of river 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.170
 January 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.050
 many breeders participated in the course 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.090
 of reins of riding and training 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:27.439
 even for those who know the basics to learn 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.439
 correct is never too much 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.960
 Joseph traveled from the Holy Spirit to 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.510
 the southern haras located in the city 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.879
 two bars in rio de janeiro to 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.980
 participate in the course and reins 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.200
 dressage and riding the project 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.260
 mangalarga walker for all 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:53.129
 the desire to learn more about riding 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:56.469
 had a special reason 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.309
 It is true that one of the goals of the 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:00.670
 track 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:03.159
 he is in a training center but 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.740
 so I'm with mine now 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:07.570
 intention I want to introduce my 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.789
 animals so that's what I solved 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.710
 will also see the body 

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:15.640
 if you want besides creating and presenting 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:17.950
 andrÃ© still like the other capixaba 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:21.280
 ten horse breeders and trainers 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.799
 participated were three - day course in 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.530
 practical class of training students 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:32.770
 learned to execute the transitions of 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:38.110
 from the palace to the march of 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:41.530
 march to the gallop the gallop back 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.450
 for walking and walking to step 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:49.179
 It seems easy is not 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:52.330
 it will really be the head 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:54.700
 It's important, yes, and we have to 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.190
 learn yes why i saw it at home 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.229
 is doing well wrong 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.479
 today I 'm learning that it's important 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:03.069
 always where the guy needs to 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.190
 the speed and the animal does not stop 

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:09.550
 It starts when it's good for us to 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:13.150
 learned from the most experienced guy is 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:16.300
 opening day is the opposite reina 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:19.209
 direct opposition and retreat 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.550
 these were the commands practiced by the 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:24.640
 knights to guide the marchers in the 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.560
 desired direction hands and legs had 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.680
 that act in sync 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.030
 this brought two animal side areas that 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.560
 such as a specific problem 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.420
 just for us to see its evolution 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.459
 accompanied here during the course that is 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.450
 short but I think with little time to 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:43.480
 hearing a lot of difference to the 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:46.510
 elbow hands and lowering of the 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.340
 legs details practiced on the part of 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.560
 walker riding 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.049
 after the exercises practiced the 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.110
 course students were tested with a 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:59.080
 dressage test the figures required 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:02.440
 that the knights should perform all 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.910
 technical resources seized 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.850
 while students performed the 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:11.150
 command notes were given for each 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:14.510
 feature run at gallop you 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:17.470
 can give 4 the best test score was the 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:20.330
 do mateus barbosa 's Photos 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.460
 won a plaid and araz cap 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:25.100
 because in your opinion it is 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:27.500
 important to perfect your knowledge 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:31.520
 I learned several head things that the 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:33.530
 We know now there on the horse farm where 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.480
 You train, you already have. 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.980
 knowledge of this is being taught 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.960
 here on this network question 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.550
 contrary how you did 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.070
 exactly the way it is being 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:45.770
 here any difference in one of the 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.510
 Days are going to make a stage but the way 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:48.980
 who knows a lot 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.620
 It's the first time I've come to cover a 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.510
 course here involves head dressage 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.880
 riding at the same time as you 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.880
 the importance of including these 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:01.550
 three themes in a single course is our 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:05.270
 horse mangalarga machador he is a 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:07.550
 horse that is has several functions right then 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:10.280
 a horse, the horse ride is bankrupt 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:12.200
 cattle is used for the competition 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.360
 gait exposure and functional tests 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.570
 So I think when we join the 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:19.489
 network that is west with dressage 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:23.210
 classic and mix the two 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:25.730
 I have a horse that I look for more 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.830
 potential not only for the march but also for 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:30.080
 I feel the functional part so why 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.910
 that I even a bit of network one 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.380
 classic dressage I think it's delicious 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.070
 I always enjoy getting people 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:38.300
 know wonderful creators people 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:40.160
 presenters was not great is not 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.930
 accompanied us to thank you guys 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.400
 also that came here is wonderful 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.400
