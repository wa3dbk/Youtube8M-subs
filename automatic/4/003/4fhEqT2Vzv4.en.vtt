00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:09.610 
snowflake like this here's the graph of

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.970 
snowflake like this here's the graph of
the<00:00:09.700> snowflake<00:00:10.240> which<00:00:10.840> you'll<00:00:11.049> find<00:00:11.080> on<00:00:11.650> my

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:11.980 
the snowflake which you'll find on my

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.140 
the snowflake which you'll find on my
website<00:00:13.709> you<00:00:14.709> want<00:00:14.920> to<00:00:15.010> make<00:00:15.160> sure<00:00:15.430> that<00:00:16.029> you

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:16.150 
website you want to make sure that you

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.770 
website you want to make sure that you
start<00:00:16.539> knitting<00:00:17.020> from<00:00:17.619> the<00:00:17.770> bottom<00:00:18.310> and<00:00:18.780> every

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:19.780 
start knitting from the bottom and every

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.980 
start knitting from the bottom and every
time<00:00:20.020> you<00:00:20.500> work<00:00:21.040> a<00:00:21.220> row<00:00:21.630> you're<00:00:22.630> going<00:00:22.780> to<00:00:22.840> make

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:22.990 
time you work a row you're going to make

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.070 
time you work a row you're going to make
a<00:00:23.020> little<00:00:23.260> dot<00:00:24.090> so<00:00:25.090> that<00:00:25.270> you'll<00:00:25.390> know<00:00:25.480> if<00:00:25.960> you

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:26.080 
a little dot so that you'll know if you

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.750 
a little dot so that you'll know if you
have<00:00:26.230> to<00:00:26.350> stop<00:00:26.560> in<00:00:26.710> the<00:00:26.800> middle<00:00:26.830> where<00:00:27.610> you

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:27.760 
have to stop in the middle where you

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.140 
have to stop in the middle where you
left<00:00:27.970> off<00:00:28.240> and<00:00:28.480> where<00:00:28.750> to<00:00:28.900> start<00:00:29.340> so<00:00:30.340> have<00:00:31.119> a

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:31.150 
left off and where to start so have a

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.080 
left off and where to start so have a
pencil<00:00:31.660> handy<00:00:31.840> and<00:00:32.289> have<00:00:33.280> the<00:00:33.399> graph<00:00:33.610> handy

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.090 
pencil handy and have the graph handy

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.760 
pencil handy and have the graph handy
and<00:00:34.530> now<00:00:35.530> we're<00:00:35.710> ready<00:00:35.860> to<00:00:36.010> start<00:00:37.470> the<00:00:38.470> actual

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:47.590 
that the edges wouldn't curl and I did

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.290 
that the edges wouldn't curl and I did
the<00:00:47.710> same<00:00:47.860> thing<00:00:48.130> at<00:00:48.250> the<00:00:48.309> bottom<00:00:48.489> but<00:00:49.180> if

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300
