00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:13.160
 Gardaland to Portaventura through Miragica we are in the company of Gianni 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.060
 modena in which we ask immediately about this professional career that is 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.060
 living to pay it was my first park 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:24.609
 the first park is like the first love that always remains in the heart then it is 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:27.989
 a very positive experience with alpha park e 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.890
 wma company with which I had a great time 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.510
 to miragica where it was 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.670
 siena with my colleagues we opened this beautiful park 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.130
 a small park but still a park 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.589
 and then it happened that 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:48.849
 which happens not only to an actor when a part is proposed in a film is 

00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:52.460
 important sabar from its own characteristics 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.100
 and then look 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.840
 that resists quia resistant is that person who brought gardaland 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:04.579
 a huge 90's and Prato Garda never to be among the first parks in Europe 

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:07.740
 so when the call arrived, the faith was deducted because here it is resistant 

00:01:07.739 --> 00:01:12.490
 of other federations I have not had many quotations I have accepted with enthusiasm 

00:01:12.489 --> 00:01:17.130
 adivinha work here portaventura which I think is one of the most beautiful parks 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.790
 of Europe and certainly also at international level 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.760
 so it is a new tea adventure that will see the specific occupancy of which 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.760
 role and with what objectives 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.290
 my rolo 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:30.630
 obviously it wasn't 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.310
 could not be different from that of taking care of the restaurant many 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.900
 catering 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.650
 I'm looking after the attractions on the stores 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.930
 I also deal with purchases and therefore, or more than one word sum role is a lot 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.360
 charming 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.670
 and certainly a very important experience 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.679
 very high motivation 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:55.930
 and but are notoriously icons with colleagues 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.030
 we are here working together with the executives we found here 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.990
 if we are trying to optimize to the fullest 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.280
 this park is a beautiful park so the restaurant is definitely 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.450
 one of his strong dishes to make a play on words what you find that 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.690
 what it will bring of his within this sector 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.059
 porta ventura catering has always been a sector 

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:25.339
 very important for the park we have tried to optimize with ours 

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:30.150
 experience I love you inserted a single supplier and therefore we look for vert 

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:33.859
 starting costs in management we also intervened 

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:39.689
 also in the last nation of the recipes and trying to respect, however, the 

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:41.159
 theming because 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:43.019
 here in this park 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.260
 it is very important to keep the sun in the areas even of the least 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:51.189
 but then, how much does the letter of a park as a gateway weigh on the restaurant? 

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:55.809
 what are the numbers of this important sector the park can count on 5 

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:57.770
 restaurants and then we have 8 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.920
 great if it would have been a fortnight to give about fifteen chions pn 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.999
 you know that portaventura has four thirds 

00:03:04.999 --> 00:03:09.739
 obviously i know the hotels there is always an unser service and is always a restaurant of 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:14.189
 a mid-level restaurant of a high standard so we are able to cover 

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:19.239
 any need also tree of request tags and also d 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:24.009
 price then moon substantial intervention from the point of view of 

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:28.639
 catering but it is not the only one also as regards shops and merchandise 

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:30.899
 they have been important variations 

00:03:30.899 --> 00:03:35.099
 as it is in the restaurant we also intervened in the stores we have 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:36.119
 brought 

00:03:36.119 --> 00:03:38.689
 from italy a sanda mink rising 

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:41.879
 who worked with the big Italian brands 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:46.040
 we saw him again a little, all she has 8 and then the set-up we take care of 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.519
 very much the presentation of the product and these intervention I must say is giving us 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:55.249
 great satisfaction in terms of the boat proceeds proceeds 

00:03:55.249 --> 00:03:57.469
 and also customer satisfaction 

00:03:57.469 --> 00:04:00.389
 or is certainly of this tn 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:03.430
 Italo Spanish and that we brought 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.559
 inside shops a different light is a love of color I must say 

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:09.360
 only 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:13.670
 I also like very much we touched on the catering topic 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.560
 the topic of movement shops is one of the main points of a theme park 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.780
 are the attractions also in this direction have been made of 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.240
 important interventions 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.479
 the first thing we did 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:28.900
 we made all the traction available to our audience because 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.889
 I think it is important that those who pay the ticket immediately initiated the 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:36.440
 opportunity to enjoy all the attractions of this beautiful park 

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:39.849
 we have for example restored the temple of the fuego that 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.050
 I think it's one of the attractions 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.740
 unique in the world 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.650
 many interventions regarding the theme park but obviously it is 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.289
 portaventura is not only made up of a theme park, there is something more 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:53.800
 portaventura beyond 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.599
 eheh this park has a beautiful water park and so is it 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:03.879
 truly a tourist center for every need the park water park 

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:05.030
 entertainment 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.469
 moreover if also 11 Verona clubs 

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:10.770
 beautiful beach that always available to our guests 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.520
 they are painful by 8 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.210
 and her guests are another key point 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.110
 what is the main difference between the Italian market and the market of 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:21.309
 posture now 

00:05:21.309 --> 00:05:26.249
 portaventura is truly an international park here our guests are 

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:28.180
 English reds 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:34.020
 many French Spaniards is a bit of Dutch in some German and I have to say 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:38.919
 few Italians do not expect this that we want a lot 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:43.210
 to make an even more international park an adventure 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:48.440
 we are looking for other markets and therefore our goal is certainly that 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.629
 to make our offer as international as possible
