00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.880
 as it is true four months of having 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.070
 announced the trailer finally reaches 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:44.040
 you the first part of videogames 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.170
 canceled tibet prototypes us and yes like 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.170
 they could observe this time I'll talk about 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.930
 sonic extreme and before I start I want 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.059
 tell them some little things one that I'm 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.550
 looking for ideas for special videos 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.949
 how are the 500 special 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.989
 subscribers and the Christmas special already 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.720
 which is the first Christmas that he celebrated 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.910
 exists please recommend me something that 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.940
 I think it's good for you to do since I'm not 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.979
 very good doing specials can 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.530
 leave me in the description of the video or 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.500
 by personal message your ideas for those 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.690
 special videos and when you have 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.880
 all those ideas I will make a mini video 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.920
 saying the ideas of all of them and 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.369
 I will leave to vote which of all 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.080
 it seems good to do two if you ask 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.570
 why did it take me to do the first 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.390
 chapter then the reason and I said many 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.850
 times and that's my school that for some 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.740
 strange reason I think everything gets 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.350
 and cons and prevents me from doing videos like 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.320
 the tasks are the works of Christmas 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.600
 projects among others but as well as 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.700
 I, too, am waiting for the day when 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.119
 finally let me do quietly a 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:54.570
 video or relax xp and well I think that 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:57.030
 that's all hehe well well said that 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.140
 what every user wanted to hear the 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.140
 word let's start 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.390
 sonic extreme is a platform game 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.700
 that was intended for the megadrive 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.819
 but it was just a project which 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:14.010
 it would go to the dry 32x but that finally 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:17.550
 they decided that it would be for sega saturn 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.260
 blood but you will wonder then why 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.360
 what did not come out so here comes what 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.550
 interesting the game had many 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.709
 problems to be designed in addition to 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.049
 lack resources to perform such a game 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:31.310
 that as you could see it was going to be in 3d 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:35.880
 but that was finally abandoned in 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:38.190
 1996 what a pity not the project 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.260
 called extreme and was designed by two 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.630
 teams one would be responsible for performing 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.030
 the levels of the game and the other of 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.730
 place bosses and enemies go both 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.040
 work and so that for the game 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.959
 It will be canceled but luckily 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.540
 they could draw the times of their great 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.790
 work but there were only four these 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.549
 are the four areas provided jade 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.310
 goody crystal frost red sands and 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:05.880
 galaxy which had very good 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:08.310
 look and they looked amazing xp but 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.790
 not only was that also they are and they would have 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.610
 new 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.349
 units like a turn bar a few rings 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.810
 that would throw it where it was 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:18.030
 located the other and being able to jump twice 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.310
 which was already possible in previous 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.560
 games but I needed a field 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:27.239
 magnetic already know the monitor with a 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:29.609
 ray xd in 1996 some representatives 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.769
 of Japanese sega went to the 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:34.590
 headquarters of sega technical institute for 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:36.450
 verify the progress of the game they do not 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.340
 They showed no impression whatsoever 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.500
 progress made in the engine 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.659
 main game but they were 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.489
 impressed by the boss engine and 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:46.909
 they asked that the whole game be 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:49.680
 modified with the engine in place 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:51.659
 unfortunately at that time the 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.000
 team was running out of hand 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:56.280
 work and everyone had fallen on the team 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.620
 of the extreme project to finish it before 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.260
 the Christmas deadline was impossible 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.239
 In addition to cooking and not talking about a 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.579
 pokemon talked about the manager of 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:07.919
 project which had been working 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:09.959
 in excess and without rest to take out 

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:12.419
 forward this project had been 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:15.060
 Sick of very understandable pneumonia 

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:17.280
 no and that's why the team had back 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:20.250
 too much so they deduced that no 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.079
 I would come out before Christmas and I would 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.260
 I imagine the poor children who are 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:27.060
 they were left with the illusion x in the game 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.639
 unfortunately it was canceled 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.770
 officially arrives from america decided 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:34.200
 interrupt the game and change it for a 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:37.520
 alternative project which was called 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:40.580
 guess what they are and three of the 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:43.410
 Exactly why there was so much similarity 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.810
 well now I will talk to you a bit about 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:48.780
 my impressions and other things more xy 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.760
 the game seemed very good since as 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.370
 we can see was going to have things that 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.680
 they seemed very interesting like the way 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:58.800
 to see the game screen which was 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:01.139
 focused on fisheye look too 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.030
 there were interesting things like that 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:05.070
 are and could run on the walls and 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.960
 could change the severity which 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:09.690
 explains why in videos we can 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.850
 see what they are and almost also fly 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:14.550
 way of playing it looked very fun and 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:17.360
 entertaining could have even competed 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:19.969
 very good with Mario 64 but 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.799
 unfortunately I can not see the light 

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:24.110
 but imagine if I had left 

00:05:21.799 --> 00:05:26.629
 I bet it would be one of the best 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:28.759
 games sold at that time and it will be 

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:31.710
 I would have broken so fast but that's 

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:33.770
 another story xd 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:36.570
 and well I hope you liked it 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:38.580
 I regret that the video was short but 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:40.890
 I want to make a video game in addition 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:43.350
 is to see how this series is doing and 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:45.510
 if that happens then I'll start putting 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:48.150
 two games so that it is not so short the 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:51.000
 clear video all pretty much like this 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:53.130
 and if someone wants to recommend me some 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.290
 game that I'm curious to know if 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:57.450
 was canceled or has beta content that 

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:59.850
 it's interesting you can say it in the 

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:02.370
 comments and remember that I do not respond 

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:04.350
 offensive comments whether they are not 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:06.210
 He liked the video because it was not what 

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:08.220
 they waited since you can not be 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:10.260
 perfect xp 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:12.630
 remember that it's close to Christmas and 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.190
 I need ideas for videos so if 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:16.590
 do you have any idea that you want me 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:18.960
 suggest tell me and if it seems good what 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:21.240
 I will also need ideas for the 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.010
 special 500 subscribers since the 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:26.370
 other specials were not at all 

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:28.440
