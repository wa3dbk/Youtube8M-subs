Iseman<00:00:02.970> and<00:00:03.330> what<00:00:03.899> we've<00:00:04.020> built<00:00:04.170> today<00:00:04.470> is<00:00:04.650> an

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
Iseman and what we've built today is an

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.900 
Iseman and what we've built today is an
infrared<00:00:05.600> paint<00:00:06.600> remover<00:00:07.259> so<00:00:07.950> basically<00:00:08.580> for

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
infrared paint remover so basically for

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.339 
infrared paint remover so basically for
the<00:00:09.000> cost<00:00:09.240> of<00:00:09.389> a<00:00:09.480> couple<00:00:09.660> gallons<00:00:10.170> of

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
the cost of a couple gallons of

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:11.720 
the cost of a couple gallons of
conventional<00:00:10.950> horrible<00:00:11.490> for<00:00:11.670> the

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
conventional horrible for the

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.030 
conventional horrible for the
environment<00:00:12.240> and<00:00:12.509> not<00:00:13.259> so<00:00:13.530> nice<00:00:13.679> to<00:00:13.830> breathe

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
environment and not so nice to breathe

paint remover
you<00:00:15.480> can<00:00:15.750> build<00:00:16.010> about<00:00:17.010> fifty<00:00:17.340> dollars<00:00:17.550> total

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
you can build about fifty dollars total

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.519 
you can build about fifty dollars total
cost<00:00:18.029> you<00:00:18.690> can<00:00:18.779> build<00:00:18.960> something<00:00:19.140> that<00:00:19.410> will

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
cost you can build something that will

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.250 
cost you can build something that will
actually<00:00:19.650> heat<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.520> paint<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.300> separate<00:00:22.140> the

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
actually heat the paint and separate the

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.290 
actually heat the paint and separate the
bond<00:00:22.470> between<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:23.160> paint<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.850> oils<00:00:24.150> in

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
bond between the paint and the oils in

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.970 
bond between the paint and the oils in
the<00:00:24.390> wood<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:24.930> build<00:00:25.199> this<00:00:25.289> over<00:00:25.590> this

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
the wood and to build this over this

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.640 
the wood and to build this over this
weird<00:00:26.279> thing<00:00:26.490> called<00:00:26.730> a<00:00:26.789> ceramic<00:00:27.330> heater

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 
weird thing called a ceramic heater

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:30.529 
weird thing called a ceramic heater
ceramic<00:00:28.650> infrared<00:00:29.130> heater<00:00:29.429> this<00:00:30.150> is<00:00:30.359> then

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
ceramic infrared heater this is then

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.459 
ceramic infrared heater this is then
spliced<00:00:30.929> on<00:00:31.230> just<00:00:32.390> two<00:00:33.390> wires<00:00:33.660> from<00:00:33.870> it<00:00:34.260> then

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
spliced on just two wires from it then

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.520 
spliced on just two wires from it then
spliced<00:00:34.890> on<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.399> a<00:00:35.430> higher<00:00:36.420> gauge<00:00:36.899> I<00:00:37.230> took<00:00:37.410> this

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
spliced on to a higher gauge I took this

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.200 
spliced on to a higher gauge I took this
from<00:00:37.680> an<00:00:37.739> old<00:00:37.890> microwave<00:00:38.250> cord<00:00:38.820> from<00:00:38.969> an<00:00:39.090> old

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
from an old microwave cord from an old

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.680 
from an old microwave cord from an old
microwave<00:00:39.559> this<00:00:40.559> is<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.739> paint<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.690> rolling

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
microwave this is a paint a rolling

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:43.970 
microwave this is a paint a rolling
paint<00:00:42.989> brush<00:00:43.200> thing<00:00:43.410> that<00:00:43.559> I<00:00:43.590> took<00:00:43.680> the

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
paint brush thing that I took the

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.979 
paint brush thing that I took the
rolling<00:00:44.309> part<00:00:44.579> off<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:45.390> then<00:00:45.510> supplies<00:00:45.870> to

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
rolling part off of and then supplies to

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.600 
rolling part off of and then supplies to
built<00:00:46.200> this<00:00:46.320> out<00:00:46.500> of<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.649> garbage<00:00:46.920> can<00:00:47.309> lid<00:00:47.370> just

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
built this out of a garbage can lid just

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.779 
built this out of a garbage can lid just
cut<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.149> into<00:00:48.300> pieces<00:00:48.570> I<00:00:49.020> put<00:00:49.469> some<00:00:49.950> rivets<00:00:50.579> on

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
cut it into pieces I put some rivets on

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.160 
cut it into pieces I put some rivets on
it<00:00:50.940> as<00:00:51.059> well<00:00:51.539> they<00:00:51.899> were<00:00:51.960> probably

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
it as well they were probably

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.479 
it as well they were probably
unnecessary<00:00:52.440> I<00:00:52.800> should<00:00:52.980> have<00:00:53.070> just<00:00:53.219> use<00:00:53.340> this

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
unnecessary I should have just use this

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.510 
unnecessary I should have just use this
thin<00:00:53.760> gauge<00:00:53.940> wire<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.680> basically<00:00:56.010> create<00:00:56.340> a

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
thin gauge wire to basically create a

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.160 
thin gauge wire to basically create a
frame<00:00:56.820> for<00:00:57.059> this<00:00:57.210> you<00:00:57.510> can<00:00:57.660> feel<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.020> heat

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
frame for this you can feel the heat

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.410 
frame for this you can feel the heat
from<00:00:58.350> it<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.649> doesn't<00:00:59.370> seem<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.670> like<00:00:59.699> be

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
from it and doesn't seem to like be

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.420 
from it and doesn't seem to like be
boiling<00:01:00.899> my<00:01:01.050> skin<00:01:01.379> or<00:01:01.500> anything<00:01:01.680> but<00:01:02.129> just

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
boiling my skin or anything but just

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.709 
boiling my skin or anything but just
putting<00:01:02.640> my<00:01:02.789> hand<00:01:03.000> in<00:01:03.120> front<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.359> it<00:01:03.449> briefly

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
putting my hand in front of it briefly

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.840 
putting my hand in front of it briefly
and<00:01:03.989> then<00:01:04.619> we've<00:01:04.769> sliced<00:01:05.040> that<00:01:05.159> onto<00:01:05.400> here<00:01:05.610> the

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
and then we've sliced that onto here the

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.280 
and then we've sliced that onto here the
cool<00:01:06.030> thing<00:01:06.180> about<00:01:06.270> using<00:01:06.390> this<00:01:06.750> paint<00:01:07.020> roller

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
cool thing about using this paint roller

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.719 
cool thing about using this paint roller
is<00:01:07.500> one<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:07.830> gives<00:01:07.920> us<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.130> convenient<00:01:08.549> handle

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
is one it gives us a convenient handle

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.030 
is one it gives us a convenient handle
here<00:01:09.299> this<00:01:09.840> is<00:01:09.930> just<00:01:10.110> electrical<00:01:10.619> tape<00:01:10.799> that's

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
here this is just electrical tape that's

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.190 
here this is just electrical tape that's
slowly<00:01:11.310> melting<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:11.939> not<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.720> best<00:01:12.869> quality

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
slowly melting and not the best quality

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.469 
slowly melting and not the best quality
thing<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.439> use<00:01:13.670> it<00:01:14.670> gives<00:01:14.820> us<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.060> convenient

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
thing to use it gives us the convenient

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.580 
thing to use it gives us the convenient
handle<00:01:15.720> here<00:01:15.930> and<00:01:16.110> this<00:01:16.200> is<00:01:16.320> actually

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
handle here and this is actually

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.219 
handle here and this is actually
threaded<00:01:17.070> inside<00:01:17.490> so<00:01:18.150> those<00:01:18.299> thick<00:01:18.630> extender

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
threaded inside so those thick extender

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.570 
threaded inside so those thick extender
things<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.799> you<00:01:19.890> use<00:01:20.130> like<00:01:20.340> if<00:01:20.460> you're

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
things that you use like if you're

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.730 
things that you use like if you're
rolling<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:21.030> ceiling<00:01:21.390> you<00:01:21.869> can<00:01:22.020> use<00:01:22.140> that<00:01:22.320> to

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
rolling the ceiling you can use that to

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.830 
rolling the ceiling you can use that to
hold<00:01:22.979> this<00:01:23.159> up<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.759> get<00:01:23.909> rid<00:01:24.060> of<00:01:24.090> those<00:01:24.240> popcorn

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
hold this up to get rid of those popcorn

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.170 
hold this up to get rid of those popcorn
paint<00:01:25.710> things<00:01:26.009> on<00:01:26.220> your<00:01:26.340> ceiling<00:01:26.520> or<00:01:26.880> anything

it's<00:01:39.750> kind<00:01:40.020> of<00:01:40.200> nothing<00:01:40.500> happening<00:01:40.700> but<00:01:41.700> when

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:41.910 
it's kind of nothing happening but when

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.350 
it's kind of nothing happening but when
I<00:01:41.940> hold<00:01:42.270> this<00:01:42.450> up<00:01:43.130> it's<00:01:44.130> not<00:01:44.340> instantaneous<00:01:44.940> I

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
I hold this up it's not instantaneous I

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.440 
I hold this up it's not instantaneous I
use<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.720> 900<00:01:46.260> watt<00:01:46.440> the<00:01:47.400> plans<00:01:47.670> I<00:01:47.850> saw<00:01:48.060> before

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
use the 900 watt the plans I saw before

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.350 
use the 900 watt the plans I saw before
this<00:01:48.630> used<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.500> thousand<00:01:49.950> watt<00:01:50.160> this<00:01:51.030> paints

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
this used a thousand watt this paints

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.240 
this used a thousand watt this paints
probably<00:01:51.690> from<00:01:51.930> I<00:01:52.200> mean<00:01:52.890> it<00:01:53.070> could<00:01:53.220> be

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
probably from I mean it could be

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.220 
probably from I mean it could be
original<00:01:53.730> from<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:53.940> 30s<00:01:54.360> looks<00:01:54.870> like<00:01:55.020> it's<00:01:55.170> a

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:55.230 
original from the 30s looks like it's a

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:56.450 
original from the 30s looks like it's a
couple<00:01:55.500> layers<00:01:55.650> so<00:01:55.890> I'm<00:01:55.950> guessing<00:01:56.250> this<00:01:56.340> is

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
couple layers so I'm guessing this is

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.490 
couple layers so I'm guessing this is
probably<00:01:56.760> you<00:01:57.630> know<00:01:57.660> fifties<00:01:58.200> sixties

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
probably you know fifties sixties

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.950 
probably you know fifties sixties
something<00:01:59.220> old<00:01:59.460> it<00:01:59.760> smells<00:02:00.510> really<00:02:00.840> really

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
something old it smells really really

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.500 
something old it smells really really
bad<00:02:01.230> keep<00:02:01.890> the<00:02:01.980> file<00:02:02.160> you<00:02:02.430> can<00:02:02.550> check<00:02:02.850> it<00:02:03.030> even

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 
bad keep the file you can check it even

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.780 
bad keep the file you can check it even
as<00:02:03.720> you're<00:02:03.930> heating<00:02:04.110> it<00:02:04.320> with<00:02:04.500> a<00:02:04.800> scraper<00:02:05.130> and

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
as you're heating it with a scraper and

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.490 
as you're heating it with a scraper and
you'll<00:02:05.910> see<00:02:06.090> now<00:02:06.120> just<00:02:06.570> scraping<00:02:06.810> like<00:02:07.080> before

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
you'll see now just scraping like before

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.290 
you'll see now just scraping like before
I'm<00:02:08.070> actually<00:02:08.220> getting<00:02:08.459> layers<00:02:08.790> of<00:02:09.000> paint<00:02:09.179> off

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
I'm actually getting layers of paint off

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.120 
I'm actually getting layers of paint off
now<00:02:09.540> sometimes<00:02:10.140> it<00:02:10.350> will<00:02:10.440> actually<00:02:10.830> if<00:02:11.010> you

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
now sometimes it will actually if you

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.770 
now sometimes it will actually if you
hold<00:02:11.340> it<00:02:11.430> there<00:02:11.610> long<00:02:12.300> enough<00:02:12.510> it<00:02:12.660> should

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
hold it there long enough it should

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.890 
hold it there long enough it should
actually<00:02:12.930> bubble<00:02:13.440> up<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.800> paint<00:02:14.040> a<00:02:14.100> bit<00:02:14.900> and

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
actually bubble up the paint a bit and

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.180 
actually bubble up the paint a bit and
what<00:02:16.050> we're<00:02:16.200> doing<00:02:16.470> is<00:02:16.560> we're<00:02:16.740> heating<00:02:17.010> the

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
what we're doing is we're heating the

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.580 
what we're doing is we're heating the
paint<00:02:17.430> in<00:02:17.610> breaking<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.270> bond<00:02:18.510> between<00:02:19.260> the

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
paint in breaking the bond between the

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.270 
paint in breaking the bond between the
paint<00:02:19.830> and<00:02:21.260> the<00:02:22.260> in<00:02:22.500> this<00:02:22.680> case<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.070> paint

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
paint and the in this case the paint

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.600 
paint and the in this case the paint
below<00:02:23.550> and<00:02:23.820> then<00:02:23.910> eventually<00:02:25.340> we'll<00:02:26.340> get<00:02:26.459> the

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
below and then eventually we'll get the

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.430 
below and then eventually we'll get the
actual<00:02:26.970> wood<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:27.300> you<00:02:27.690> most<00:02:27.840> likely<00:02:28.110> want<00:02:28.410> to

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
actual wood and you most likely want to
