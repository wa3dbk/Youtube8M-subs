00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:11.030
 this type of cord we need two 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:13.550
 couples the couple that goes abroad 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:16.920
 is the one that marks us 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:19.880
 let's say the contour of the cord 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.560
 and the couple in the interior 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:26.550
 in this case the color now only 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:29.340
 We work with white thread as not 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.910
 there would be difference 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.640
 the pins that I put distributed in 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.720
 the different sections only is for 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.820
 keep me in the position of 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:44.050
 cutting 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:47.649
 the movements as you see 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:51.280
 and I turn it past only shot of the 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:53.140
 bobbin threads from outside the 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.899
 oranges I do not do anything with them that 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.629
 only to keep them in their 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:02.280
 site with the exteriors is with those who 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:02.280
 I'm giving the shape to the cord 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.750
 Now that I see that he wants to get up 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.700
 a little bit the title in a row above 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:16.159
 positioned him here but only for 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:19.679
 keep a little in place 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:21.780
 man this because it's now for the 

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:24.770
 shows but then when it comes to work 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:28.320
 the distances tend to be shorter 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:31.409
 It is a cord and very beautiful and easy to 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:35.970
 realize that sometimes if at the beginning what 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:38.880
 confused with a clear liquid plane 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.040
 the writer looks like but has nothing 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.620
 stay 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.360
 Well, more or less that's how it looks like 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.200
 you can form the wta 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.200
 the exterior
