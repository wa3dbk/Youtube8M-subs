00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
so this video tech tip of the day is

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.799 
so this video tech tip of the day is
dealing<00:00:07.109> with<00:00:07.700> advanced<00:00:08.700> rear<00:00:09.420> derailleur

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
dealing with advanced rear derailleur

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.660 
dealing with advanced rear derailleur
adjustment<00:00:10.290> with<00:00:10.590> high<00:00:10.830> low<00:00:11.010> limits<00:00:11.429> and

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
adjustment with high low limits and

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.730 
adjustment with high low limits and
these<00:00:12.509> are<00:00:12.690> your<00:00:12.780> high<00:00:12.960> low<00:00:13.110> limits<00:00:13.469> these

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
these are your high low limits these

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.340 
these are your high low limits these
back<00:00:14.280> out<00:00:14.490> screws<00:00:14.790> right<00:00:15.030> here<00:00:15.350> usually

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
back out screws right here usually

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.019 
back out screws right here usually
you're<00:00:16.590> gonna<00:00:16.650> find<00:00:16.949> a<00:00:17.070> letter<00:00:17.279> associated

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
you're gonna find a letter associated

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.210 
you're gonna find a letter associated
with<00:00:18.180> these<00:00:18.390> screws<00:00:18.960> one<00:00:19.230> being<00:00:19.529> H<00:00:19.740> and<00:00:19.949> one<00:00:20.070> B

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
with these screws one being H and one B

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.150 
with these screws one being H and one B
now<00:00:20.600> the<00:00:21.600> H<00:00:21.810> is<00:00:22.050> being<00:00:22.289> your<00:00:22.470> high<00:00:22.650> limit<00:00:23.010> and

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
now the H is being your high limit and

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.920 
now the H is being your high limit and
this<00:00:23.369> will<00:00:23.609> be<00:00:23.760> doing<00:00:23.970> usually<00:00:24.510> with<00:00:24.720> your

this will be doing usually with your
lower<00:00:25.699> your<00:00:26.699> low<00:00:26.880> limit<00:00:27.180> is<00:00:27.300> gonna<00:00:27.480> be

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
lower your low limit is gonna be

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.720 
lower your low limit is gonna be
your<00:00:27.779> bigger<00:00:27.990> cog<00:00:28.320> here<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:28.830> what<00:00:29.460> you<00:00:29.580> need

natural starting position whether it's a
top<00:01:37.770> or<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.159> lower<00:01:38.369> cog<00:01:38.670> so<00:01:39.270> now<00:01:39.390> I'm

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
top or the lower cog so now I'm

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.660 
top or the lower cog so now I'm
going<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.630> pedal<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.920> as<00:01:41.040> you<00:01:41.189> can<00:01:41.340> see<00:01:41.520> I've

going to pedal and as you can see I've

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.060 
going to pedal and as you can see I've
dropped<00:01:41.970> down<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.509> lower<00:01:43.140> but<00:01:43.920> as

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
all the way down to the lower cog coming

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.910 
all the way down to the lower cog coming
back<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.290> that<00:01:49.320> issue<00:01:50.869> where<00:01:51.869> we<00:01:52.320> need<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.710> make

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.499 
back to that issue where we need to make
that<00:01:53.100> adjustment<00:01:53.220> with<00:01:53.759> our<00:01:53.909> high<00:01:54.030> low<00:01:54.210> limit

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
that adjustment with our high low limit

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
yep so now we're starting at the natural

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.759 
yep so now we're starting at the natural
position<00:03:27.769> that<00:03:28.159> we<00:03:28.280> need<00:03:28.430> to<00:03:28.580> start<00:03:28.879> hmm<00:03:29.769> so

00:03:30.759 --> 00:03:30.769 
position that we need to start hmm so

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:32.470 
position that we need to start hmm so
I'm<00:03:30.980> gonna<00:03:31.099> pedal<00:03:31.489> and<00:03:31.730> now<00:03:31.879> I'm<00:03:32.150> gonna<00:03:32.269> go

I'm gonna pedal and now I'm gonna go
through<00:03:32.510> all<00:03:32.720> the<00:03:32.900> gears<00:03:33.110> so<00:03:33.890> I<00:03:33.950> get<00:03:34.129> up<00:03:34.250> to<00:03:34.459> my

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
through all the gears so I get up to my

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.119 
through all the gears so I get up to my
lower<00:03:34.849> limit<00:03:37.750> and<00:03:38.750> as<00:03:39.110> I<00:03:39.260> do<00:03:39.319> this<00:03:39.680> I'm<00:03:40.040> going

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:40.129 
lower limit and as I do this I'm going

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:42.729 
lower limit and as I do this I'm going
to<00:03:40.580> be<00:03:41.299> dealing<00:03:41.690> with<00:03:41.720> barrel<00:03:42.230> adjustment

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
to be dealing with barrel adjustment

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:44.619 
to be dealing with barrel adjustment
like<00:03:42.830> we<00:03:43.069> talked<00:03:43.370> about<00:03:43.489> earlier<00:03:44.060> in<00:03:44.269> the<00:03:44.390> tech

00:03:44.619 --> 00:03:44.629 
like we talked about earlier in the tech

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:47.470 
like we talked about earlier in the tech
tip<00:03:44.840> of<00:03:45.049> barrel<00:03:45.680> adjustment<00:03:46.190> and<00:03:46.310> this<00:03:46.970> is<00:03:47.239> to

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
tip of barrel adjustment and this is to

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.339 
tip of barrel adjustment and this is to
fine-tune<00:03:48.230> your<00:03:49.099> rear<00:03:49.879> derailleur<00:03:50.239> I'm<00:03:51.200> gonna

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:51.349 
fine-tune your rear derailleur I'm gonna

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:53.770 
fine-tune your rear derailleur I'm gonna
go<00:03:51.470> up<00:03:51.590> one<00:03:51.769> gear<00:03:52.040> and<00:03:52.250> if<00:03:53.030> you<00:03:53.209> notice<00:03:53.540> it

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
go up one gear and if you notice it

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.539 
go up one gear and if you notice it
hasn't<00:03:54.110> gone<00:03:54.200> up<00:03:54.440> so<00:03:54.769> I'm<00:03:55.040> gonna<00:03:55.190> make<00:03:55.370> that

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
hasn't gone up so I'm gonna make that

00:03:55.549 --> 00:04:00.550 
hasn't gone up so I'm gonna make that
adjustment<00:03:56.349> I'm<00:03:57.349> gonna<00:03:57.530> turn<00:03:57.739> it<00:03:57.920> in<00:03:59.560> until

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
adjustment I'm gonna turn it in until

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.319 
adjustment I'm gonna turn it in until
that<00:04:00.620> gear<00:04:00.920> moves<00:04:01.160> up<00:04:03.910> there<00:04:04.910> it<00:04:05.030> is

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:05.329 
that gear moves up there it is

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:06.940 
that gear moves up there it is
and<00:04:05.720> you<00:04:05.840> want<00:04:06.019> to<00:04:06.109> hear<00:04:06.260> it<00:04:06.349> move<00:04:06.500> up<00:04:06.650> nice<00:04:06.920> and

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
and you want to hear it move up nice and

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.089 
and you want to hear it move up nice and
clean<00:04:07.519> so<00:04:07.910> I'm<00:04:07.970> gonna<00:04:08.090> back<00:04:08.329> down<00:04:08.980> I'll<00:04:09.980> go

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:10.099 
clean so I'm gonna back down I'll go

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:14.530 
clean so I'm gonna back down I'll go
through<00:04:10.310> the<00:04:10.370> gear<00:04:10.579> again<00:04:13.510> make<00:04:14.510> sure

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
through the gear again make sure

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.390 
through the gear again make sure
everything<00:04:15.140> is<00:04:15.230> shifting<00:04:15.650> right<00:04:15.829> nice<00:04:16.160> and

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400
