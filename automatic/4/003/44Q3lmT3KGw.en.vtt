00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 hello and welcome to the new 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.940
 video and I'll show you again today 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.940
 old sensors on which connects the three 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.910
 I have an album sensor one now 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.849
 old light sensor and an old nxt 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.410
 motor connected 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:17.850
 and if I'm here first an overview 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.100
 goes then I see here before the 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.600
 fitness of those already knows 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.189
 whatever the app is programmed with 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.260
 and I can already see it soon 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:29.880
 that the sensor with the color is not 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.689
 is compatible and can be a few 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.020
 adjust things 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.840
 he will take ours with us 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.480
 same sensor programmed as he here 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.730
 I will tell you in a video again 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.440
 show the ultrasound sensor as well 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.340
 Sensors from third party manufacturers in the 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:50.300
 temperature sensor and other more 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:53.160
 rather seldom sold sensors fun 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:56.579
 and I'll be there at the same time 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.870
 but a portier is first I go 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.789
 here on it 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:07.400
 I want the sensor to be pressed 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:07.400
 Compare the touch sensor 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:19.570
 a whole going on the pace I let him go 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:21.759
 be finally and then I have to do the whole thing 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.960
 hire grandma like a time and 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:27.399
 with a light sensor I find here 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.740
 that is not my father 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:32.619
 why I reflected the strength of the 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.690
 Light tms must be a professional 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:37.630
 be made and not for the duration 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.860
 just because it is so his endings and 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.590
 then it should not be so again 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:46.350
 are thus connected to optimized 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.350
 comes in and then tests the program 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.430
 as you have seen the kudamm without 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.659
 problems works and as I said in the 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.090
 I will give you the next video today 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:29.709
 show how you Bucharest other sensors 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:34.060
 the ex completely use because the 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:35.769
 wet and I'm only going to old 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.129
 next race is to go to a both 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:40.269
 No extra lenses 10.3 I give 

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:41.379
 hope that again if 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.909
 any questions about that 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:44.230
 compatibility with the sensors which 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:46.389
 you can always take care of me 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.680
 request and otherwise thanks for the too 

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:49.680
 are up to the next video
