hi today I'll be reviewing the

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.630 
hi today I'll be reviewing the
difference<00:00:03.360> between<00:00:03.770> vanilla<00:00:04.770> extract<00:00:05.279> and

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
difference between vanilla extract and

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.070

vanilla<00:00:06.450> essence

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
vanilla essence

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.040 
vanilla essence

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
now it's like any international recipe

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.290 
now it's like any international recipe
you<00:00:10.200> see<00:00:10.440> you<00:00:10.590> only<00:00:10.800> find<00:00:11.219> vanilla<00:00:11.670> extracts

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
you see you only find vanilla extracts

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.780 
you see you only find vanilla extracts
mentioned<00:00:12.750> to<00:00:12.900> it<00:00:13.049> and<00:00:13.290> you<00:00:13.740> wonder<00:00:14.099> oh<00:00:14.250> my<00:00:14.400> god

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
mentioned to it and you wonder oh my god

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.490 
mentioned to it and you wonder oh my god
am<00:00:14.849> I<00:00:14.940> missing<00:00:15.000> out<00:00:15.330> on<00:00:15.389> some<00:00:15.719> kinda<00:00:16.080> recipe

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
am I missing out on some kinda recipe

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.349 
am I missing out on some kinda recipe
because<00:00:16.770> I<00:00:16.800> don't<00:00:17.220> have<00:00:17.400> vanilla<00:00:17.520> extract<00:00:17.820> and

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
because I don't have vanilla extract and

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.450 
because I don't have vanilla extract and
it<00:00:18.810> is<00:00:18.960> very<00:00:19.230> expensive<00:00:19.560> because<00:00:20.160> the

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
it is very expensive because the

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.240 
it is very expensive because the
difference<00:00:20.820> is<00:00:21.029> like<00:00:21.210> almost<00:00:21.720> 500<00:00:22.560> to<00:00:22.680> 700

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
difference is like almost 500 to 700

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.410 
difference is like almost 500 to 700
percent<00:00:23.730> so<00:00:25.580> over<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.640> period<00:00:26.670> of<00:00:27.000> time<00:00:27.240> I've

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
percent so over a period of time I've

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.929 
percent so over a period of time I've
experimented<00:00:27.990> with<00:00:28.230> these<00:00:28.529> two<00:00:28.800> things<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.369> I

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
experimented with these two things and I

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.450 
experimented with these two things and I
realize<00:00:30.449> actually<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.590> difference<00:00:31.949> is<00:00:32.070> not

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
realize actually the difference is not

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.940 
realize actually the difference is not
that<00:00:32.520> much<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.780> main<00:00:33.989> differences<00:00:34.559> yes

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
that much the main differences yes

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.580 
that much the main differences yes
vanilla<00:00:35.520> essence<00:00:35.850> is<00:00:36.149> is<00:00:36.420> it<00:00:36.960> is<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.170> cramp

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
vanilla essence is is it is a cramp

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.920 
vanilla essence is is it is a cramp
chemical<00:00:38.010> chemical<00:00:38.399> emailed<00:00:38.969> or<00:00:39.270> product<00:00:39.719> and

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
chemical chemical emailed or product and

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.319 
chemical chemical emailed or product and
vanilla<00:00:40.739> extract<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.670> National<00:00:42.090> server

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
vanilla extract is the National server

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.479 
vanilla extract is the National server
that's<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:43.050> huge<00:00:43.290> difference<00:00:43.500> but<00:00:44.129> otherwise

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
that's a huge difference but otherwise

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.729 
that's a huge difference but otherwise
they<00:00:45.090> are<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.600> difference<00:00:46.020> in<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.350> product

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
they are the difference in the product

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.040 
they are the difference in the product
or<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.129> paste<00:00:47.640> of<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.940> product<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:48.780> nothing

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
or the paste of the product is nothing

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.400 
or the paste of the product is nothing
is<00:00:49.649> cinch<00:00:50.010> I<00:00:50.780> have<00:00:51.780> this<00:00:51.960> vanilla<00:00:52.350> extract

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
it is an expensive for not what I to is

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.219 
it is an expensive for not what I to is
I<00:01:07.350> use<00:01:07.650> vanillite<00:01:08.640> strikes<00:01:09.000> more<00:01:09.330> custards

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
I use vanillite strikes more custards

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
me the difference is not much just be

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.359 
me the difference is not much just be
careful<00:01:42.750> about<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.079> quantity<00:01:43.590> if<00:01:43.920> they<00:01:44.250> are

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
careful about the quantity if they are

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.609 
careful about the quantity if they are
mentioned<00:01:44.850> one<00:01:45.119> teaspoon<00:01:45.780> or<00:01:46.079> one<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.439> half

teaspoon<00:01:47.250> of<00:01:47.369> vanilla<00:01:47.490> extract<00:01:47.759> you<00:01:48.450> put<00:01:48.689> half

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
teaspoon of vanilla extract you put half

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.310 
teaspoon of vanilla extract you put half
of<00:01:49.680> that<00:01:50.070> quantity<00:01:50.490> of<00:01:51.000> vanilla<00:01:51.659> essence<00:01:52.140> in

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
of that quantity of vanilla essence in

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.530 
of that quantity of vanilla essence in
your<00:01:52.560> recipe<00:01:53.040> it<00:01:53.460> is<00:01:53.579> vanilla<00:01:53.850> essence<00:01:54.329> if<00:01:54.450> you

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
your recipe it is vanilla essence if you

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.510 
your recipe it is vanilla essence if you
put<00:01:54.750> in<00:01:54.899> that<00:01:55.110> much<00:01:55.409> quantity<00:01:55.920> then<00:01:56.130> it<00:01:56.310> does

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
put in that much quantity then it does

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.850 
put in that much quantity then it does
affect<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.060> taste<00:01:57.270> so<00:01:57.689> that's<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.500> only

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
affect the taste so that's the only

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:59.389 
affect the taste so that's the only
difference

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
difference

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.859 
difference
the<00:01:59.670> cost<00:01:59.969> is<00:02:00.500> mainly<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.649> cost<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.729> it's<00:02:03.659> the

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
the cost is mainly the cost the it's the
