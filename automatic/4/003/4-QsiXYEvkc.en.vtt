actually ran at 60 frames per second
what<00:02:56.940> I<00:02:57.270> know<00:02:57.360> right<00:02:57.630> it<00:02:57.750> actually<00:02:58.020> sounds

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
what I know right it actually sounds

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.020 
what I know right it actually sounds
crazy<00:02:58.500> about<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:58.800> 1989<00:02:59.430> original<00:02:59.850> Gameboy

crazy about the 1989 original Gameboy
actually<00:03:00.600> ran<00:03:00.780> at<00:03:00.960> 60fps<00:03:01.650> of<00:03:01.950> course<00:03:02.190> there

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
actually ran at 60fps of course there

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.010 
actually ran at 60fps of course there
was<00:03:02.460> a<00:03:02.490> ton<00:03:02.730> of<00:03:02.760> motion<00:03:03.270> blur<00:03:03.390> so<00:03:03.690> it<00:03:03.810> didn't

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
was a ton of motion blur so it didn't

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.240 
was a ton of motion blur so it didn't
really<00:03:04.230> count<00:03:04.380> for<00:03:04.590> anything<00:03:04.770> but<00:03:05.070> if<00:03:05.160> you

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
really count for anything but if you

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.440 
really count for anything but if you
really<00:03:05.400> want<00:03:05.640> to<00:03:05.700> get<00:03:05.790> technical<00:03:06.030> this<00:03:06.330> is

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
really want to get technical this is

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.910 
really want to get technical this is
actually<00:03:06.900> true<00:03:07.110> and<00:03:07.410> it<00:03:07.500> kind<00:03:07.650> of<00:03:07.680> makes<00:03:07.860> you

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
actually true and it kind of makes you

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.350 
actually true and it kind of makes you
think<00:03:08.070> the<00:03:08.220> 60<00:03:08.550> frames<00:03:08.760> per<00:03:08.850> second<00:03:09.180> really

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
think the 60 frames per second really

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.790 
think the 60 frames per second really
matter<00:03:09.570> it<00:03:09.810> didn't<00:03:10.050> really<00:03:10.140> seem<00:03:10.380> like<00:03:10.530> it<00:03:10.650> did

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
matter it didn't really seem like it did

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.010 
matter it didn't really seem like it did
then<00:03:11.010> but<00:03:11.220> it<00:03:11.340> certainly<00:03:11.550> does<00:03:11.970> now<00:03:12.210> number

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
then but it certainly does now number

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.650 
then but it certainly does now number
two<00:03:13.820> Nintendo<00:03:14.820> actually<00:03:15.120> created<00:03:15.540> an

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
two Nintendo actually created an

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.270 
two Nintendo actually created an
original<00:03:16.050> game<00:03:16.170> boy<00:03:16.350> that<00:03:16.530> had<00:03:16.680> backlighting

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
original game boy that had backlighting

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.590 
original game boy that had backlighting
yeah<00:03:17.430> some<00:03:17.610> of<00:03:17.640> you<00:03:17.820> younger<00:03:18.060> folks<00:03:18.300> may<00:03:18.450> not

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
yeah some of you younger folks may not

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.880 
yeah some of you younger folks may not
remember<00:03:18.810> this<00:03:19.020> but<00:03:19.230> playing<00:03:19.440> the<00:03:19.500> original

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
remember this but playing the original

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.950 
remember this but playing the original
Gameboy<00:03:20.070> in<00:03:20.340> the<00:03:20.460> dark<00:03:20.670> was<00:03:20.850> a<00:03:20.880> fish<00:03:21.300> usually

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:21.960 
Gameboy in the dark was a fish usually

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.270 
Gameboy in the dark was a fish usually
had<00:03:22.080> to<00:03:22.140> get<00:03:22.230> a<00:03:22.260> little<00:03:22.380> third-party<00:03:22.950> clip<00:03:23.130> on

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
had to get a little third-party clip on

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.590 
had to get a little third-party clip on
book<00:03:23.520> light<00:03:23.730> but<00:03:23.910> that<00:03:23.940> was<00:03:24.180> really<00:03:24.450> awkward

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
book light but that was really awkward

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.240 
book light but that was really awkward
as<00:03:24.960> so<00:03:25.140> usually<00:03:25.530> we<00:03:25.620> were<00:03:25.710> just<00:03:25.860> playing<00:03:26.040> by

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
as so usually we were just playing by

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.740 
as so usually we were just playing by
moonlight<00:03:26.520> or<00:03:26.880> waiting<00:03:27.180> until<00:03:27.240> the<00:03:27.480> morning

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
moonlight or waiting until the morning

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.270 
moonlight or waiting until the morning
but<00:03:27.900> in<00:03:27.990> Japan<00:03:28.290> there<00:03:28.560> was<00:03:28.680> a<00:03:28.710> Game<00:03:28.950> Boy<00:03:28.980> that

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
but in Japan there was a Game Boy that

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.740 
but in Japan there was a Game Boy that
featured<00:03:29.580> a<00:03:29.670> backlight<00:03:30.030> unfortunately<00:03:30.690> it

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
featured a backlight unfortunately it

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.240 
featured a backlight unfortunately it
was<00:03:30.840> never<00:03:31.020> released<00:03:31.350> outside<00:03:31.470> of<00:03:31.740> Japan<00:03:31.890> and

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
was never released outside of Japan and

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.770 
was never released outside of Japan and
we<00:03:32.370> never<00:03:32.550> saw<00:03:32.760> it<00:03:32.790> here<00:03:33.000> in<00:03:33.060> the<00:03:33.120> States<00:03:33.360> but

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
we never saw it here in the States but

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.600 
we never saw it here in the States but
they<00:03:33.900> do<00:03:33.960> exist<00:03:34.440> out<00:03:34.650> there<00:03:34.680> I<00:03:35.040> really<00:03:35.370> wish<00:03:35.490> I

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
they do exist out there I really wish I

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.120 
they do exist out there I really wish I
had<00:03:35.790> one<00:03:35.940> when<00:03:36.120> I<00:03:36.150> was<00:03:36.330> a<00:03:36.390> kid<00:03:36.570> number<00:03:37.470> one

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
had one when I was a kid number one

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.680 
had one when I was a kid number one
all<00:03:38.670> right<00:03:38.790> this<00:03:38.880> fact<00:03:39.120> is<00:03:39.270> a<00:03:39.300> little<00:03:39.510> obvious

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
all right this fact is a little obvious

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.180 
all right this fact is a little obvious
if<00:03:40.020> you<00:03:40.050> like<00:03:40.230> to<00:03:40.350> think<00:03:40.530> about<00:03:40.710> science<00:03:40.920> and

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
if you like to think about science and

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.680 
if you like to think about science and
stuff<00:03:41.370> but<00:03:41.520> it<00:03:41.610> is<00:03:41.760> still<00:03:42.000> absolutely

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
stuff but it is still absolutely

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.480 
stuff but it is still absolutely
mind-blowing<00:03:43.200> the<00:03:43.500> technology<00:03:44.010> contained<00:03:44.310> in

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:44.490 
mind-blowing the technology contained in

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.550 
mind-blowing the technology contained in
a<00:03:44.580> single<00:03:44.760> gameboy<00:03:45.240> unit<00:03:45.540> in<00:03:45.630> 2000<00:03:46.200> exceeds

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
a single gameboy unit in 2000 exceeds

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.230 
a single gameboy unit in 2000 exceeds
all<00:03:46.740> the<00:03:46.980> computing<00:03:47.400> power<00:03:47.520> that<00:03:47.790> was<00:03:47.910> used<00:03:48.150> to

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:48.240 
all the computing power that was used to

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.120 
all the computing power that was used to
put<00:03:48.390> the<00:03:48.480> first<00:03:48.690> man<00:03:48.840> on<00:03:48.990> the<00:03:49.140> moon<00:03:49.350> in<00:03:49.590> 1969

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
put the first man on the moon in 1969

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.190 
put the first man on the moon in 1969
data<00:03:50.880> storage<00:03:51.240> was<00:03:51.360> so<00:03:51.510> small<00:03:51.780> back<00:03:51.990> in<00:03:52.110> the

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
data storage was so small back in the

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.780 
data storage was so small back in the
60s<00:03:52.560> that<00:03:52.710> basically<00:03:53.010> anything<00:03:53.340> even<00:03:53.670> my

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
60s that basically anything even my

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.460 
60s that basically anything even my
phone<00:03:54.000> even<00:03:54.240> my<00:03:54.420> watch<00:03:54.720> has<00:03:55.050> more<00:03:55.230> computing

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
phone even my watch has more computing

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:56.780 
phone even my watch has more computing
power<00:03:55.650> than<00:03:56.010> what<00:03:56.070> it<00:03:56.220> took<00:03:56.310> to<00:03:56.370> get<00:03:56.580> the<00:03:56.670> man

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
power than what it took to get the man

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:57.980 
power than what it took to get the man
on<00:03:56.910> the<00:03:57.000> moon<00:03:57.150> but<00:03:57.300> it's<00:03:57.450> really<00:03:57.660> weird<00:03:57.780> if<00:03:57.930> you

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:57.990 
on the moon but it's really weird if you

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:59.360 
on the moon but it's really weird if you
think<00:03:58.170> about<00:03:58.230> it<00:03:58.440> that<00:03:58.530> a<00:03:58.590> child's<00:03:59.010> toy<00:03:59.190> that

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
think about it that a child's toy that

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:00.830 
think about it that a child's toy that
has<00:03:59.490> technology<00:03:59.820> that<00:04:00.210> surpassed<00:04:00.600> the
