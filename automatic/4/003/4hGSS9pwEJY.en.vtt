00:00:00.639 --> 00:00:04.020
 The former dancer wanted to get a window against Dusseldorf as well 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.790
 Top players Lucerne plastic not to be missed sat down without further ado 

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:11.099
 in the car and came from Poland to visit the Bexbach dpa 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.310
 otherwise it was noticeable everywhere 

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:17.200
 the anticipation of the comparison with Europe's strongest team window 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.390
 against Duesseldorf the two most successful German teams in a duel 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.480
 that's also true for an Asiatic stayed with something special too 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.779
 because he was there 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:26.580
 Timo Boll 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.420
 Germany's flagship table tennis player the current number 3 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:30.269
 of the world 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.640
 he too was looking forward to the individual Westerwald the Bundeswehr likes to come 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.840
 with ten points 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.210
 but in the games on the "Focus" that was already clear before should be 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.860
 Guests as tour favorites 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.170
 even if national player Christian sweet the team due to injury 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.760
 always missing 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.489
 they had even more exceptional players in the covenant 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.149
 for example Patrick Baum he looked in his match against the EU that 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:56.039
 Game steaks until the mid-sixties on so can the pace 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.220
 and close in Singapore China is not the slightest chance 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.340
 Fridays still had only one world class man the tours in the 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.679
 Champions League beaten 

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:06.750
 but now he was completely lacking in attitude to the game 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.340
 a fresh in action 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.219
 no rest during long rallies 

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:14.079
 the WHO was completely out of timing against a strong Patrick tree 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.240
 he is despised at 45 7 for tree 1 0 for Dusseldorf 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.570
 Borussia coach Danny Heister's Names Acknowledgment It was going according to plan 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.180
 for the record champion 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.689
 Especially since in the second single of the day a point was scheduled 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.490
 in a duel between Thomas Pawelka and Timo Boll 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.100
 but the Czech played well over the long phases of the game 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.180
 Duels with Wolf in the outsider role feels the PDC perennial favorite Voigt 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.120
 The results certainly save early for Wolf remained to seven and eleven 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.100
 to 6 too 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.850
 Both Pawelka failed to play on the landfill litter again and again 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.510
 Minor errors crept in 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.580
 that makes it the third in the world ranking easy 8 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.050
 Third place went with 11 to 8 a few wobbly 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.780
 and otherwise showed the Czech phased why he likes to Boll 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.780
 plays two examples 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.889
 the bottom line but it should be too little and Dusseldorf's number one 

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:25.020
 seriously threatening already in the fourth sentence Boll made everything clear 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.020
 Score sings to the 9 point ball 

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:36.920
 the second 0 for Dusseldorf 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.159
 Mr. Becker had to admit the class of Timo Boll enviously 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:43.180
 that he always enjoys going to the parent company of not losing and that 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.829
 the 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:46.319
 he is such a game to have where you are 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.810
 the sermon holds and not the Bringer but not so 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.130
 You really have to enjoy that if you already go the murder plans the orders 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.589
 came then you have 

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:58.229
 the vocal one can give everything one can play free that 

00:02:58.229 --> 00:03:02.309
 is for that which is fun but I want to go as a winner goes like that 

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:06.189
 he was there fluttering as far as want 

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:10.290
 he did not really like that, he wanted to win, of course, Andreas 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.829
 Schonhardt the opponent for me he plays very well 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:16.669
 Not because there are more who do not treat cyclists 

00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:22.269
 Rainer big task with the beat in the third single of the day 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:25.709
 but then on the Westerwälder on the first point by Zoltan fejer-konnerth 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.279
 right in the picture the children sleep 

00:03:28.279 --> 00:03:31.319
 and the trend so caught is its good start in the sentences 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:34.779
 Fürth lost in round one and four each with six to two 

00:03:34.779 --> 00:03:36.269
 But to see sentences at 8 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:37.150
 especially bitter 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.480
 in the passage two had fejer-konnerth at the score of 10 to 4 6 from the spell on 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.200
 But after all, the hunt's intent on a 12 to 10 sentence makes sense only 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.890
 the third set went with 11 to 8 at the title 10 too little to Dusseldorf 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:50.709
 seriously endanger this day 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.499
 the record champion celebrated a sovereign 3 to 0 in the Westerwald the 

00:03:54.499 --> 00:03:57.889
 On the other hand, the hosts already collected the third in the fourth season game 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:00.219
 defeat 

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:01.759
 I guess so 

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:06.499
 this result is in Frankenthal one of the thugs of Dusseldorf want 

00:04:06.499 --> 00:04:09.249
 I would at least percent world 

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:10.589
 four years 

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:12.599
 the best team in Europe around 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:16.629
 We proved that again today but that can be shorter so that 

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:18.949
 not all players over 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:21.949
 always turned »I say HD against Lee Ho 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:23.460
 Dr 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.759
 If that is not a self-starter it can also lose runners Alejo quite a bit 

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:28.789
 plays well 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:32.249
 well, should represent first open game 

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:36.379
 and I also often close heavy opponents of TranStar from close 

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:39.529
 believe you can already satisfied home with a 3 0 

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:42.569
 but that does not always have to be the case 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:46.009
 a good-humored Timo Boll flattened then a little with the 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:48.110
 Colleagues diligently wrote autographs 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.170
 and also played a few rallies with the offspring 

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:54.580
 Dancer was a good place for him and the record champion this year 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.630
 Borussia Dusseldorf here feels like picking up Boll's dog Carry points 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.260
 even if it can sometimes be animal-smooth in the drawbridge hall
