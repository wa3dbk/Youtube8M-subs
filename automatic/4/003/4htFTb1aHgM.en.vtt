00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 drawings can be done 12 years 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.800
 it is done quite simply no but there is 

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.459
 a few tricks 

00:00:08.459 --> 00:00:10.089
 here we are now 

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:13.089
 make a picture 

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:17.949
 rub red ribbon 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:20.769
 and i say 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:22.669
 this apple doesn't pretend to 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:24.519
 what kind of design delights are there 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:26.599
 purely to show 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:29.099
 it's done 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.399
 in all 

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:33.530
 can be quite slow when 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.640
 to understand until they took off their paws 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.460
 tons 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.740
 not dried 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.800
 paint and if not just covers on 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.110
 ohte 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.000
 almost unreal 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 because they are not a falkner 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.620
 but silent 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.770
 tightly inflicted remember but a piece 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.210
 bullseye red horn 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.210
 get down it is held for the first time 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.260
 not 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.760
 thick fabric 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.150
 it is important to remove it with the crankcase so that 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.160
 these hear something that will create it 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.520
 such amount of prime will really be 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.950
 there you have dad paint here 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.490
 just if spartak 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.640
 that principle drawing we have succeed 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.160
 red 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.160
 recall 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.300
 Did not work out 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.760
 by giving 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.650
 in turn that he could 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.810
 what please do not push much 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.030
 on large drawings on small drawings this 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.079
 matter she's a big figure like this 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:40.620
 dimple experience let's say 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.620
 very large well you engraving 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.230
 if you push hard just like that 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.800
 you are here inside this drawing start right 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.590
 remove paws 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:54.890
 paint 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.890
 here i just did 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.670
 if you have with someone it turns on our 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.130
 tanks are already working 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.450
 not fully drawing 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.190
 better to clean you up immediately like 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.369
 the minister 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.369
 Belarus experience was not taken into account 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:30.389
 installment plan
