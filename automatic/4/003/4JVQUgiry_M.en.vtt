 digging up asparagus 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.700
 harvesting pneumatic engraving units 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.649
 is achieved when the recessed prototypes 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.720
 still with a laser point to the series 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:47.300
 should a camera capture available 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:50.290
 Like the bands, the position is known 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.290
 the rods caught 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.360
 the asparagus is stored in the small 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:59.250
 From there, the vegetables are sliding

 a skilled driver 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.750
 especially advantageous is that too 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.750
 can be worked at night 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.500
 the sting unit consists of a c 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.690
 profile that stands for harvest in the earth 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.120
 The knife is made of a flat steel 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:32.150
 in the back of the profile in two 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.190
 minutes is performed with a crossing 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.410
 a total of three dams can be harvested 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.880
 become 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:41.410
 the asparagus panther is served with 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.410
 two joysticks on the driver's seat 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:59.370
 The steaming olian will be in front of the panther 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.370
 taken and filed behind it again
