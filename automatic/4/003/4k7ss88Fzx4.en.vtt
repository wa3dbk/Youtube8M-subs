00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 hello friends in touch denis far off 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.069
 continue to study with you the blues today 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.820
 we 'll talk about a Memphis style 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.380
 memphis funk blues that is it 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.590
 combination blues 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.710
 and funky leaving respectively 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.660
 it is very such an interesting style and at that 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.740
 At the same time, many are familiar with him if you 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.720
 We know the song by departure 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.660
 stevie ray vaughan or are you familiar with 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.750
 this style, that is, it is something like this 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.750
 sounds 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.750
 that is, here it is a basic figure based on 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.610
 which is built in the future 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.190
 batches now I'll show you how you can 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.050
 think about in order to create 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.770
 party in this style so take 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.830
 typical key in E major 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:59.570
 densely in place in E major at the beginning 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:01.370
 must beat a chord in d major 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:05.110
 I do this as follows 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.110
 take some base notes for example 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.210
 are watching 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.909
 but 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.610
 but 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.570
 very characteristic is this use 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.570
 filling 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.650
 open strings 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.379
 which are part of reed import 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.780
 there may also be different 

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:20.370
 extra moves and beating 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.370
 chord using got stops 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:30.030
 for men 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.030
 strong 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:57.290
 you can experiment further 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.290
 add 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:07.069
 what is here filling alcohol tonic 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.240
 work 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:24.340
 In addition, you can for example spoil 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:27.010
 learn such compositions as rolled 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.379
 batin stevie ray vaughan from mary had 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:31.120
 a little m and he basically has a lot 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:34.030
 such standards in style and 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.819
 of the funk the most important thing remember that here 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:41.700
 basic figure funk in blues that is 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:41.700
 fans bought looks like this 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:04:00.219
 that is, you can build on it 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.430
 how is this done here in this world 

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:02.430
 bodies 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.229
 this 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:43.260
 try to take harmony blues and 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.650
 slowly play the game in that 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:49.460
 character thinking 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:49.460
 some passages moves 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.830
 on 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:24.740
 these are small ideas to create 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:27.260
 Memphis Funk Blues Party 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:29.690
