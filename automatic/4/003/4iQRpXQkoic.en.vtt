00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 
you drift when you speed it up you know

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.730 
you drift when you speed it up you know
it<00:05:42.270> it<00:05:42.630> looks<00:05:42.900> so<00:05:43.020> real

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 
it it looks so real

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.710 
it it looks so real
it<00:05:44.160> sounds<00:05:44.490> so<00:05:44.640> real<00:05:44.910> I<00:05:45.120> mean<00:05:45.150> and<00:05:45.570> the

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:45.720 
it sounds so real I mean and the

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.980 
it sounds so real I mean and the
graphics<00:05:46.200> is<00:05:46.350> very<00:05:46.620> very<00:05:46.890> nice<00:05:47.160> I<00:05:47.490> mean<00:05:48.300> maybe

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990 
graphics is very very nice I mean maybe

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.440 
graphics is very very nice I mean maybe
it<00:05:49.320> would<00:05:49.590> beat<00:05:49.830> the<00:05:50.130> PSP<00:05:50.910> version<00:05:51.300> because

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:51.450 
it would beat the PSP version because

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:54.200 
it would beat the PSP version because
I've<00:05:51.750> played<00:05:52.080> the<00:05:52.290> PSP<00:05:52.710> version<00:05:52.740> and<00:05:53.370> the<00:05:54.000> full

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.210 
I've played the PSP version and the full

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.480 
I've played the PSP version and the full
speed<00:05:54.540> it<00:05:54.780> didn't<00:05:55.110> light<00:05:55.320> up<00:05:55.350> it<00:05:55.830> didn't<00:05:56.280> met

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490 
speed it didn't light up it didn't met

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:01.280 
speed it didn't light up it didn't met
my<00:05:57.270> expectations<00:05:57.630> on<00:05:58.230> the<00:05:58.320> PSP<00:05:59.810> so<00:06:00.810> it<00:06:01.050> has

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:01.290 
my expectations on the PSP so it has

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:04.850 
my expectations on the PSP so it has
different<00:06:01.590> levels<00:06:02.450> go<00:06:03.450> undercover<00:06:03.780> rule<00:06:04.650> the

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:04.860 
different levels go undercover rule the

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.490 
different levels go undercover rule the
road<00:06:05.330> power<00:06:06.330> cheaper<00:06:06.870> you<00:06:06.990> can<00:06:07.050> earn

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:07.500 
road power cheaper you can earn

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.730 
road power cheaper you can earn
performance<00:06:08.220> upgrades<00:06:08.700> like<00:06:09.030> boost<00:06:09.740> speed

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:10.740 
performance upgrades like boost speed

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:12.800 
performance upgrades like boost speed
acceleration<00:06:11.220> and<00:06:11.760> handling<00:06:12.090> for<00:06:12.330> greater

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:12.810
