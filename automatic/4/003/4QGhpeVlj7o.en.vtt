into<00:01:08.159> that<00:01:08.400> just<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.729> make<00:01:08.880> sure<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.119> held<00:01:09.510> it

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
into that just to make sure it held it

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.190 
into that just to make sure it held it
ultra-high<00:01:10.409> okay<00:01:10.770> so<00:01:11.640> now<00:01:11.820> let's<00:01:12.150> just<00:01:12.930> do<00:01:13.170> a

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
ultra-high okay so now let's just do a

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.020 
ultra-high okay so now let's just do a
deathmatch<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:14.159> see<00:01:14.340> how<00:01:14.490> it<00:01:14.580> performs<00:01:14.850> you

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030

I'll try and just yeah as I said keep an

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.210 
I'll try and just yeah as I said keep an
eye<00:02:33.540> on<00:02:33.570> the<00:02:33.720> frames<00:02:33.900> per<00:02:34.110> second<00:02:34.500> to<00:02:34.590> see<00:02:34.830> how

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
eye on the frames per second to see how

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.840 
eye on the frames per second to see how
it<00:02:35.370> performs<00:02:36.560> can<00:02:37.560> see<00:02:37.710> now<00:02:37.860> and<00:02:38.280> then<00:02:38.400> as<00:02:38.610> I<00:02:38.700> go

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
it performs can see now and then as I go

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.310 
it performs can see now and then as I go
through<00:02:38.880> some<00:02:39.300> levels<00:02:39.630> there<00:02:39.840> are<00:02:39.870> a<00:02:39.990> few

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
through some levels there are a few

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.960 
through some levels there are a few
frame<00:02:40.740> drops<00:02:41.070> but<00:02:41.280> nothing<00:02:41.670> to<00:02:41.760> write<00:02:41.790> home

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
addicted to just playing this it's

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.830 
addicted to just playing this it's
easily<00:03:13.920> playable<00:03:14.430> I'll<00:03:14.670> try<00:03:14.820> sayings<00:03:15.390> i<00:03:15.450> don't

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
easily playable I'll try sayings i don't

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.170 
easily playable I'll try sayings i don't
know<00:03:16.020> again<00:03:16.320> why<00:03:16.590> it<00:03:16.650> says<00:03:17.040> or<00:03:17.520> to<00:03:17.850> detect

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
know again why it says or to detect

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.060 
know again why it says or to detect
although<00:03:18.540> I<00:03:18.570> guess<00:03:18.960> I<00:03:18.990> just<00:03:19.110> they<00:03:19.890> have

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
although I guess I just they have

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.450 
although I guess I just they have
encoded<00:03:20.340> it<00:03:20.640> for<00:03:20.880> my<00:03:21.000> GPU<00:03:21.570> yet<00:03:21.860> I'm<00:03:22.860> sure<00:03:23.250> when

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:23.460 
encoded it for my GPU yet I'm sure when

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.930 
encoded it for my GPU yet I'm sure when
they<00:03:23.580> do<00:03:25.100> it<00:03:26.100> will<00:03:26.250> make<00:03:26.400> it<00:03:26.550> more<00:03:26.700> effective

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
they do it will make it more effective

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.030 
they do it will make it more effective
you<00:03:27.360> can<00:03:27.510> see<00:03:27.720> it<00:03:28.110> hasn't<00:03:28.470> really<00:03:28.590> drop<00:03:28.890> below

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
you can see it hasn't really drop below

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.430 
you can see it hasn't really drop below
thay<00:03:29.400> so<00:03:29.820> very<00:03:30.630> good<00:03:30.840> performance<00:03:30.990> on

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
thay so very good performance on

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.050 
thay so very good performance on
shadowgun<00:03:31.950> I<00:03:31.980> will<00:03:32.250> be<00:03:32.370> testing<00:03:32.730> this<00:03:32.820> game

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
shadowgun I will be testing this game

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.490 
shadowgun I will be testing this game
out<00:03:33.150> on<00:03:33.300> my<00:03:33.390> Nexus<00:03:33.720> 10<00:03:33.900> as<00:03:34.050> well<00:03:34.200> hopefully

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
out on my Nexus 10 as well hopefully

out on my Nexus 10 as well hopefully
with<00:03:34.800> a<00:03:34.830> controller<00:03:36.380> you<00:03:37.380> can<00:03:37.410> actually<00:03:37.830> also

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
with a controller you can actually also

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.580 
with a controller you can actually also
connect<00:03:38.820> a<00:03:38.970> ps3<00:03:39.360> controller<00:03:39.900> to<00:03:40.050> this<00:03:40.200> I<00:03:40.380> just

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
connect a ps3 controller to this I just

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.330 
connect a ps3 controller to this I just
haven't<00:03:40.860> done<00:03:40.890> that<00:03:41.040> yet<00:03:41.780> and<00:03:43.070> see<00:03:44.070> if<00:03:44.130> I<00:03:44.190> can

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
haven't done that yet and see if I can

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:50.170 
haven't done that yet and see if I can
kill<00:03:44.490> one<00:03:44.940> more<00:03:45.060> person<00:03:45.270> before<00:03:45.630> I<00:03:45.780> leave<00:03:46.110> I
