00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.770 
still under the snow fields and clear

can<00:01:27.960> see<00:01:28.140> for<00:01:28.290> this<00:01:28.409> next<00:01:28.710> weather<00:01:28.979> system<00:01:29.040> to

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
can see for this next weather system to

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.030 
can see for this next weather system to
run<00:01:29.610> close<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.119> southwest<00:01:30.540> so<00:01:30.689> rain<00:01:31.040> onto

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
run close to the southwest so rain onto

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.590 
run close to the southwest so rain onto
these<00:01:32.220> low<00:01:32.579> temperatures<00:01:32.939> means<00:01:33.329> that<00:01:33.509> it

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
these low temperatures means that it

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.830 
these low temperatures means that it
will<00:01:33.720> freeze<00:01:34.049> as<00:01:34.290> well<00:01:34.470> so<00:01:34.680> very<00:01:35.040> icy<00:01:35.520> in

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.910 
will freeze as well so very icy in
southern<00:01:36.840> areas<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.229> potential<00:01:37.680> for<00:01:37.799> some
