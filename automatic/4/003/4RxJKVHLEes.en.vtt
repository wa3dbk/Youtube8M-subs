00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 hi and lie anti on extension 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:06.120
 minute if you remember now I met 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.919
 or to make welder a game designer who does 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.929
 is increasingly specializing in micro 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.820
 games precisely for this reason has decided to 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.040
 send me the prototype of his last one 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.049
 creation that is in kickstarter live 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.330
 I will talk to you these days 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.279
 therefore of ninja moling a game for two 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.890
 players lasting about ten 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.779
 minutes of odf at that in the country 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.480
 kickstarter on behalf of the fgu games 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.939
 this game consists of only 24 singles 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.320
 cards hide not a card game but 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:38.160
 a game of dexterity 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:40.410
 let's go see but slamming 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.770
 instructions if I read them too long has 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.200
 to spend with the reviews is enough for you 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.670
 watch a few minutes emerge the 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.170
 starting player is determined 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.940
 by launching its own shuriken card 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.280
 towards the enemy crickets 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.750
 whoever touches the most will start the game there 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.670
 game then takes place on rounds 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.350
 subsequent during each round i 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.120
 players alternately 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.289
 they will throw the shuriken versi cards 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.030
 free your opponents 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.439
 each tapped card will then come 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.229
 removed from the game plan 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.030
 at the end of the third throw the player 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.430
 that touched more pins than 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.049
 the opponent will earn 1 spare and it will be 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.420
 the winner of the round and will start a 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.799
 next round in the event that in a 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.720
 next round will be able to be 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.000
 still the winner will transform his 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.979
 hopes for a strike in the event that 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.900
 instead a player is able to consume 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.450
 all the wines the opponents will earn 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.900
 instantly a third strike 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.390
 strike 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.310
 the player is declared the winner 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.930
 how did you see a microgame even a 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.579
 very easy micro regulation from 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.110
 explain and in a moment you start the 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.240
 match regarding the material 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.369
 I would say that he had a good twist like 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.229
 intuition on transforming the game of 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.820
 bowling in a card-only game does not have 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.770
 therefore had to resort to his that 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.780
 balls that can fall from the table or 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.640
 of cottages at the level of portability 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.649
 I would say that we are in full because 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.420
 you can really console 24 cards 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.979
 put on any pocket 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.390
 if you are then thinking that the a 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.280
 two players can be a little 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.180
 reductive to always carry it behind and 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.640
 play with friends 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.649
 know that h is already working on 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.900
 multiplayer mode if not the 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.910
 already found directly 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.649
 The press campaign a mode 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.840
 multiplayer that would be a last man 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.490
 basically there will be a standing 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.290
 subsequent elimination of players e 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.150
 will win the last remaining in the game 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.440
 with this I would say that I am leaving you 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.870
 the link below the campaign 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.760
 kickstarter, moreover, award-winning 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.610
 then shipping worldwide already 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.170
 including very low price if you are 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.640
 therefore looking for a game to make 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.140
 always behind with which to do one 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.310
 match on the fly with some friends 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.110
 just have a table top or 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.800
 however even the terrain is sufficient as 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.540
 table top 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.040
 well maybe this could do the case 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:41.410
 yours with this finished 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.410
 I greet you and tell you hello and see you soon
