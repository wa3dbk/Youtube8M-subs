00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.789
 nine o'clock in the evening I wanted you 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:38.039
 tell what happened today in 

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:40.269
 monday during the day communication with 

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:42.999
 immigration reform here I did not have time 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:45.579
 today on the way to the office you talk 

00:00:42.999 --> 00:00:47.829
 release there duty on america number 17 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:50.620
 as now I just have to do 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:53.229
 issue number 18 because today 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.530
 several interesting events happened 

00:00:53.229 --> 00:01:00.760
 daughter first is the administration of the white house 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:03.879
 Well, rough woman with boys released 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.950
 statement in which they explain that 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:09.820
 immigration reform in the sense in 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:12.869
 how they offer it to create a lot 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.609
 jobs and improve the economy 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.759
 agricultural regions due to 

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:20.920
 that there will be a temporary visa for 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.570
 workers and what's their own there 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.860
 more considerations than they like what will 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.490
 much better 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:31.060
 and I must say that there is a thin move thin 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:34.950
 the author is such a dative under the Republican respiratory 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:38.320
 because they actually appeal to 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.590
 most fundamental republican 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.430
 to the audience because these are the areas here 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.690
 agricultural where are the farmers 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.710
 this is the original territory 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.840
 republicans and they say here they are 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.320
 appeal to these people that like this she 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.000
 and it will be like this one 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.550
 I just want a blow so I thought that 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.979
 understood when we talk about 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:02.259
 Republicans have sincerely absolutely 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.900
 of me not contrived not sucked out 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:07.800
 finger is not something that does not give some cheeks 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.970
 sulked absolute disbelief 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.070
 administration is going to collect 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.140
 carry out some laws that will 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.270
 accepted affairs what are those laws which 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.520
 today they are not executed because 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.739
 today, too, can not be hired 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:24.070
 over the world of illegals but they take them and nobody 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:26.080
 doing nothing for it was the law 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.330
 another 80 sixth year on strengthening 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.709
 borders once amnesty was and no 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.769
 administration is nothing for it 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:34.660
 did tol so how would they 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:37.570
 compiles I don't know which one will be there 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.680
 success or or there is failure but beyond that 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.140
 what can be said that they are not right 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.270
 everyone thought it was a separate story but 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:48.140
 just like this is how the course 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:51.230
 as the development of events is the most 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:54.920
 interesting things happened today in the ward 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:58.940
 representatives where already went with might and main 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:01.010
 work on drafting bills in 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.970
 dota unlike the democrats who 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.970
 they want everything in one pile and such princes 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.150
 such form start complex before reform 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.460
 all-encompassing 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.500
 these years no guys do not so here 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.530
 we have this storage room there 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.360
 immigration let's get there in the corners 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.490
 With a broom we stuff some garbage there. 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:24.320
 oku take there is not a fun one so 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:26.630
 corners and begins with the fact that there is such 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:28.370
 Legal Affairs Committee 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:30.710
 he and the House of Representatives have 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.350
 Ignatius difficulty and whenever 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:36.370
 begin the passage of the law of some kind 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:38.230
 he moves to this chamber and in this chamber 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.360
 gets approval 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.760
 without the approval of the legal committee 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.810
 I took with my grandfather problems without approval 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.480
 legal committee 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:54.099
 the bill can't go like 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:55.599
 they give the floor from the notes that's where it is 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:58.330
 will be discussed there supplemented 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:04:01.260
 taken and so on so here already 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:04.930
 four bills passed 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:06.580
 Chamber Legal Committee representative 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.959
 and it will be laws 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:13.870
 that is, bills yes there about 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:16.900
 strengthening of borders and there and still all sorts 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:20.100
 faith you connected with it then there are some 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:22.360
 things that are, well, roughly so 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.550
 it will be difficult for democrats alone 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.310
 jump up but because for so many 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:31.270
 by this bills they have in 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:33.580
 principle agree ie republicans 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:36.610
 propose to adopt laws that 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:40.510
 There are no fundamental differences to 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:42.360
 Thu such a score here and the Democrats 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.759
 single of 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.530
 I will not mind when 

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:49.319
 through the House of Representatives 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.360
 will pass just to cheer and instantly that 

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:54.240
 Democrats will talk very hard 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.669
 say because basically they are not 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.080
 They want to take in parts and his mother so 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:58.530
 same as the republicans don't want 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.330
 take 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.189
 comprehensive legit say yes i'm 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.120
 quietly will do what we do 

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:05.490
 everyone agrees 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.960
 that's just as Democrats do not want 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:10.360
 take in parts 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:12.759
 disagree everyone wants to take 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.879
 such 1 form which will clean everything at once 

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:18.550
 here are beads from their point of view we clean 

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:20.680
 so we do not know how the event will 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:23.889
 further evolve one is on the very 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:28.599
 the deed adds drama to the situation 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:31.659
 because how to say how 

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:33.759
 explain to people now why not 

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:35.379
 want to vote for law strengthening 

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:37.330
 borders that's bad with reinforcement 

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:39.189
 boundaries if they are ready just now 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.689
 allocate 40 billion which 

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:43.090
 absolutely not needed by the way it was when 

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:45.939
 make the unthinkable expense god knows 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:47.560
 what and all this is understood and and in fact 

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:48.969
 they were willing to pay these 40 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.979
 billion later to shut up 

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:53.650
 republicans lest they object 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:55.599
 against this against complex 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:57.069
 reform yes no way please in this 40 

00:05:55.599 --> 00:06:00.219
 billion to strengthen the borders and but 

00:05:57.069 --> 00:06:02.590
 then let me give you everything else and how 

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:05.500
 they will now explain why they are not 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:08.560
 want to strengthen the border 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:11.650
 that is, comprehensive reform means 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:14.670
 against individual laws it's like on 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:17.200
 the level of legislators is understandable 

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:19.180
 political how would such a machine but on 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:21.250
 level specifically here the voters here 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:24.010
 explain to voters why they are not 

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:25.810
 want to make this measure or this measure 

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:27.910
 why should it be delayed why 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:29.470
 need to wait for some kind of law when 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:32.080
 you can vote for this yet 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:33.400
 do thats the rest is there turn on here 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.880
 what is accepted in the future 

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:37.930
 legislation that is politically 

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:41.169
 Democrats will be in a very difficult 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:43.990
 situations i think because nothing 

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:46.750
 such controversial or not support not 

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:48.400
 having broad support from both 

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:49.080
 parties that is among the democrats 

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:53.530
 in the middle 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:55.419
 so intermediate these groups and among 

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:57.970
 the liberals will not be there will be very 

00:06:55.419 --> 00:07:00.370
 understandable thing and very favored in 

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:02.890
 society so in general guys we 

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:05.260
 let's see so what am I going to be 

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:09.690
 newcomer immediately tell duty myself 

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:09.690
 add up and go to the airport
