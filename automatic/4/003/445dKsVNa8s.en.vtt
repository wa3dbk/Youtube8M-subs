00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
more than anything but anyway so this is

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.720

the<00:00:37.110> condition<00:00:37.530> with<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.739> midsoles<00:00:38.190> now<00:00:38.579> that

renew<00:00:40.410> on<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.649> straps<00:00:41.010> got<00:00:41.489> all<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:42.079> Jordan

looking<00:00:43.260> good<00:00:43.590> again<00:00:43.739> you're<00:00:44.460> Jordan<00:00:44.730> bubble

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239

letters aren't you know crummy and white

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.130 
letters aren't you know crummy and white
so<00:00:47.820> those<00:00:48.000> are<00:00:48.030> obviously<00:00:48.270> flattened<00:00:48.989> down

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
so those are obviously flattened down

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.160 
so those are obviously flattened down
but<00:00:49.670> they<00:00:50.670> blend<00:00:51.000> pretty<00:00:51.270> well<00:00:51.510> about<00:00:51.899> as<00:00:52.050> good

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.790 
but they blend pretty well about as good
as<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.350> can<00:00:52.440> do<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.620> suede<00:00:52.949> renew<00:00:53.329> and<00:00:54.800> clean

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
major problem with all these is the

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.749 
major problem with all these is the
midsole<00:01:36.290> paint<00:01:37.290> is<00:01:37.500> far<00:01:38.009> better<00:01:38.189> than<00:01:38.340> it<00:01:38.520> used

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
midsole paint is far better than it used

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.240 
midsole paint is far better than it used
to<00:01:38.939> be<00:01:39.030> or<00:01:39.570> than<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:39.869> is<00:01:39.990> currently<00:01:40.320> but<00:01:40.829> at<00:01:41.130> the

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
to be or than it is currently but at the

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.609 
to be or than it is currently but at the
same<00:01:41.460> time<00:01:41.729> it<00:01:42.119> rubs<00:01:42.479> off<00:01:42.720> kinase<00:01:43.290> ii<00:01:43.320> as

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
same time it rubs off kinase ii as

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.679 
same time it rubs off kinase ii as
opposed<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.130> flaking<00:01:44.579> off<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:44.939> cracking<00:01:45.420> it

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
opposed to flaking off and cracking it

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.170 
opposed to flaking off and cracking it
was<00:01:45.840> more<00:01:46.079> of<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.350> if<00:01:46.979> it<00:01:47.220> caught<00:01:47.430> up<00:01:47.579> ragin<00:01:48.030> it

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
was more of a if it caught up ragin it

was more of a if it caught up ragin it
just<00:01:48.420> would<00:01:48.570> kind<00:01:48.750> of<00:01:48.810> take<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:49.140> right<00:01:49.259> off<00:01:49.320> it

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599 
coloring but Peter is very close

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:12.820 
coloring but Peter is very close
starting<00:02:11.599> base<00:02:11.810> it's<00:02:12.080> actually<00:02:12.319> a<00:02:12.380> little<00:02:12.530> bit

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
starting base it's actually a little bit

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.160 
starting base it's actually a little bit
darker<00:02:13.459> than<00:02:13.730> the<00:02:13.970> original<00:02:14.360> color<00:02:14.569> which<00:02:14.989> of

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
darker than the original color which of

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.360 
darker than the original color which of
course<00:02:15.200> you're<00:02:15.500> seeing<00:02:15.709> the<00:02:15.800> original<00:02:16.160> there

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
course you're seeing the original there

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.559 
course you're seeing the original there
and<00:02:16.989> I<00:02:17.989> have<00:02:18.170> since<00:02:18.560> gone<00:02:18.890> and<00:02:19.340> that's<00:02:20.330> my

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
first paint experiment on shoes I have

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.720 
first paint experiment on shoes I have
this<00:02:23.720> all<00:02:23.959> taped<00:02:24.200> off<00:02:24.470> and<00:02:24.860> painted<00:02:25.580> with<00:02:25.670> a

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
this all taped off and painted with a

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.100 
this all taped off and painted with a
couple<00:02:26.060> coats<00:02:26.269> i<00:02:26.630> think<00:02:26.750> i'm<00:02:26.810> going<00:02:26.900> to<00:02:26.959> put

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110

couple coats i think i'm going to put
another<00:02:27.140> one<00:02:27.560> or<00:02:27.709> two<00:02:27.830> on<00:02:28.660> may<00:02:29.660> even<00:02:29.810> do<00:02:30.019> a

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
another one or two on may even do a

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.900 
another one or two on may even do a
matte<00:02:30.349> finish<00:02:30.380> ER<00:02:30.830> at<00:02:30.980> the<00:02:31.099> end<00:02:31.280> but<00:02:31.580> to<00:02:31.760> put

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
matte finish ER at the end but to put

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.360 
matte finish ER at the end but to put
them<00:02:32.000> side<00:02:32.209> by<00:02:32.239> side<00:02:33.130> obviously<00:02:34.130> it's<00:02:34.220> going

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
them side by side obviously it's going

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:35.860 
them side by side obviously it's going
to<00:02:34.430> be<00:02:34.489> a<00:02:34.519> little<00:02:34.610> shinier<00:02:35.090> just<00:02:35.450> all<00:02:35.630> dolled

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
to be a little shinier just all dolled

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.370 
to be a little shinier just all dolled
out<00:02:36.019> from<00:02:36.260> age<00:02:37.180> and<00:02:38.180> this<00:02:38.540> is<00:02:38.690> very<00:02:38.870> fresh<00:02:39.110> pain

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
out from age and this is very fresh pain

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.070 
out from age and this is very fresh pain
but<00:02:39.620> color-wise<00:02:40.160> a<00:02:40.190> really<00:02:41.060> close<00:02:41.360> so<00:02:41.660> no<00:02:41.900> much

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
but color-wise a really close so no much

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.100 
but color-wise a really close so no much
the<00:02:42.260> camera<00:02:42.620> can<00:02:42.799> translate<00:02:43.720> color<00:02:44.720> plus<00:02:45.080> a

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
the camera can translate color plus a

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.960 
the camera can translate color plus a
ton<00:02:45.319> of<00:02:45.380> its<00:02:45.590> missing<00:02:45.830> on<00:02:46.370> the<00:02:46.519> left<00:02:46.760> shoe

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
ton of its missing on the left shoe

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.530 
ton of its missing on the left shoe
there<00:02:47.350> technically<00:02:48.350> the<00:02:48.530> right<00:02:48.709> shoe<00:02:48.950> but

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
there technically the right shoe but

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.289 
there technically the right shoe but
left<00:02:50.540> side<00:02:50.750> of<00:02:50.930> the<00:02:50.989> camera<00:02:51.459> so<00:02:52.459> yeah<00:02:52.790> it's<00:02:53.060> got

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
left side of the camera so yeah it's got

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:56.100 
left side of the camera so yeah it's got
it<00:02:53.510> when<00:02:54.230> you<00:02:54.349> kind<00:02:54.560> of<00:02:54.590> compare<00:02:54.980> it<00:02:55.069> to<00:02:55.250> the

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
it when you kind of compare it to the

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.839 
it when you kind of compare it to the
color<00:02:57.110> here<00:02:57.380> on<00:02:57.500> the<00:02:57.620> patch<00:02:57.860> that's<00:02:58.670> pretty

00:02:58.839 --> 00:02:58.849 
color here on the patch that's pretty

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:00.339 
color here on the patch that's pretty
close<00:02:59.090> and<00:02:59.360> weren't<00:02:59.599> identical<00:03:00.019> to<00:03:00.110> begin

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:00.349 
close and weren't identical to begin

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:01.780 
close and weren't identical to begin
with<00:03:00.560> and<00:03:00.860> so<00:03:01.010> don't<00:03:01.220> have<00:03:01.340> any<00:03:01.489> metallic

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
with and so don't have any metallic

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.410 
with and so don't have any metallic
flake<00:03:02.269> in<00:03:02.450> it<00:03:03.430> but<00:03:04.430> you<00:03:04.640> know<00:03:04.670> it<00:03:04.940> keeps<00:03:05.209> that

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
flake in it but you know it keeps that

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.320 
flake in it but you know it keeps that
nice<00:03:05.660> sparkle<00:03:06.260> to<00:03:06.980> the<00:03:07.010> original<00:03:07.849> and<00:03:08.150> it

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
nice sparkle to the original and it

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.780 
nice sparkle to the original and it
gives<00:03:08.540> it<00:03:08.630> a<00:03:08.720> nice<00:03:08.840> fresh<00:03:09.230> look<00:03:09.530> and<00:03:09.860> just<00:03:10.670> to

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
gives it a nice fresh look and just to

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.819

between the frog tape which only came in

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.809 
between the frog tape which only came in
when<00:03:40.590> thickness<00:03:41.040> was<00:03:41.190> about<00:03:41.430> double<00:03:41.790> that

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 
when thickness was about double that

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.240

half the width I need of the tape is

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.180 
half the width I need of the tape is
what's<00:03:50.910> up<00:03:51.060> here<00:03:51.390> so<00:03:52.200> the<00:03:52.709> skinnier<00:03:53.070> the
