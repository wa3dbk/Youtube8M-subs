that narrator over here it starts with
the<00:02:01.180> curves<00:02:01.510> tie-in<00:02:01.930> aerator<00:02:02.620> which<00:02:03.370> is<00:02:03.580> a

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
the curves tie-in aerator which is a

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.670 
the curves tie-in aerator which is a
that's<00:02:04.300> a<00:02:04.420> good<00:02:04.600> way<00:02:04.780> to<00:02:04.810> it<00:02:05.170> we<00:02:05.320> haven't<00:02:05.530> been

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
that's a good way to it we haven't been

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.470 
that's a good way to it we haven't been
able<00:02:05.800> to<00:02:06.010> use<00:02:06.190> it<00:02:06.340> yet<00:02:06.520> the<00:02:06.940> ground<00:02:07.180> still

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:07.480 
able to use it yet the ground still

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:08.999 
able to use it yet the ground still
frozen<00:02:07.750> outside<00:02:08.350> so<00:02:08.590> we're<00:02:08.740> going<00:02:08.860> to<00:02:08.920> have

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
frozen outside so we're going to have

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.469 
frozen outside so we're going to have
another<00:02:09.250> video<00:02:09.490> in<00:02:09.729> the<00:02:09.820> future<00:02:09.850> these

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
system here we have a dispatcher a tiny

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.230 
system here we have a dispatcher a tiny
stature<00:02:20.830> now<00:02:21.400> the<00:02:21.460> good<00:02:21.670> thing<00:02:21.730> about<00:02:21.940> this

stature now the good thing about this
detacher<00:02:22.690> is<00:02:22.960> is<00:02:23.280> these<00:02:24.280> bars<00:02:24.610> here<00:02:24.910> so<00:02:25.360> I<00:02:25.690> know

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
detacher is is these bars here so I know

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.330 
detacher is is these bars here so I know
with<00:02:26.020> my<00:02:26.140> old<00:02:26.380> one<00:02:26.590> I<00:02:26.620> just<00:02:26.890> put<00:02:27.010> a<00:02:27.040> lot<00:02:27.220> of

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
with my old one I just put a lot of

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.800 
with my old one I just put a lot of
weight<00:02:27.490> on<00:02:27.520> it<00:02:27.820> and<00:02:27.910> after<00:02:28.180> a<00:02:28.210> while<00:02:28.390> these<00:02:28.630> we

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
weight on it and after a while these we

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.810 
weight on it and after a while these we
find<00:02:29.080> neck<00:02:29.260> down<00:02:29.470> and<00:02:29.500> not<00:02:30.040> be<00:02:30.190> as<00:02:30.280> effective

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
find neck down and not be as effective

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.020 
find neck down and not be as effective
this<00:02:31.210> is<00:02:31.330> going<00:02:31.480> to<00:02:31.540> prevent<00:02:31.870> this<00:02:31.990> happening

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
this is going to prevent this happening

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.060 
this is going to prevent this happening
right<00:02:34.030> here<00:02:34.450> we<00:02:34.720> have<00:02:34.750> a<00:02:34.870> plug<00:02:35.140> aerator<00:02:35.650> get

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
right here we have a plug aerator get

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.650 
right here we have a plug aerator get
some<00:02:36.250> nice<00:02:36.400> weight<00:02:36.640> to<00:02:36.670> it<00:02:36.880> we<00:02:37.120> did<00:02:37.330> have<00:02:37.510> to

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
some nice weight to it we did have to

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.150 
some nice weight to it we did have to
assemble<00:02:38.050> this<00:02:38.260> this<00:02:38.500> is<00:02:38.620> one<00:02:38.830> of<00:02:38.920> the<00:02:38.980> only

and<00:02:42.370> on<00:02:42.640> the<00:02:42.880> actual<00:02:43.030> sparkling<00:02:43.690> trailer

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
and on the actual sparkling trailer

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.170 
and on the actual sparkling trailer
itself<00:02:44.350> we<00:02:44.560> have<00:02:44.650> the<00:02:44.770> poly<00:02:44.980> roller<00:02:45.340> pod<00:02:45.970> and

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
itself we have the poly roller pod and

working with water and put some singer
blocks<00:02:48.940> on<00:02:49.120> the<00:02:49.209> top<00:02:49.420> we<00:02:49.630> get<00:02:49.750> about<00:02:49.930> 400

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
blocks on the top we get about 400

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.199 
blocks on the top we get about 400
pounds<00:02:50.800> of<00:02:50.890> downforce<00:02:51.070> which<00:02:51.640> is<00:02:51.790> great<00:02:52.030> for

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
pounds of downforce which is great for

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:53.870 
pounds of downforce which is great for
smoothing<00:02:52.780> out<00:02:52.990> your<00:02:53.050> yard

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
Frosty's stuff like that so what we're

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.690 
Frosty's stuff like that so what we're
going<00:02:56.530> to<00:02:56.590> do<00:02:56.740> next<00:02:56.980> is<00:02:57.190> we're<00:02:57.430> going<00:02:57.520> to<00:02:57.580> show

going to do next is we're going to show

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:58.770 
going to do next is we're going to show
you<00:02:57.790> kind<00:02:58.000> of<00:02:58.030> how<00:02:58.090> simple<00:02:58.420> it<00:02:58.630> is<00:02:58.750> just

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.260 
you kind of how simple it is just
exchange<00:02:59.440> out<00:02:59.590> the<00:02:59.709> poly<00:02:59.950> roller<00:03:00.280> for<00:03:00.970> the

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
exchange out the poly roller for the

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.840 
exchange out the poly roller for the
time<00:03:01.750> Rd<00:03:02.320> and<00:03:02.560> plug<00:03:02.830> area<00:03:05.430> okay<00:03:06.430> so<00:03:06.489> what<00:03:06.730> we're

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
time Rd and plug area okay so what we're

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:07.890 
time Rd and plug area okay so what we're
going<00:03:06.940> to<00:03:07.030> do<00:03:07.150> now<00:03:07.330> is<00:03:07.510> we're<00:03:07.630> just<00:03:07.660> going<00:03:07.870> to

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
going to do now is we're just going to

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.330 
going to do now is we're just going to
swap<00:03:08.140> these<00:03:08.350> throughout<00:03:08.680> gonna<00:03:08.950> show<00:03:09.130> you<00:03:09.190> how

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
swap these throughout gonna show you how

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.190 
swap these throughout gonna show you how
easy<00:03:09.370> it<00:03:09.790> is<00:03:09.880> it's<00:03:10.269> kind<00:03:10.420> of<00:03:10.570> easier<00:03:10.900> with<00:03:11.050> two

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
easy it is it's kind of easier with two

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.720 
easy it is it's kind of easier with two
people<00:03:11.410> you<00:03:11.709> couldn't<00:03:11.950> manage<00:03:12.160> it<00:03:12.370> with<00:03:12.550> one

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
people you couldn't manage it with one

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.460 
people you couldn't manage it with one
version<00:03:12.970> but<00:03:13.570> you<00:03:13.600> tend<00:03:13.900> to<00:03:13.959> have<00:03:14.110> to<00:03:14.230> want<00:03:14.410> to

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
version but you tend to have to want to

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.380 
version but you tend to have to want to
lay<00:03:14.620> the<00:03:14.769> unit<00:03:15.040> on<00:03:15.160> its<00:03:15.340> back<00:03:15.550> to<00:03:15.760> do<00:03:15.910> that<00:03:16.120> but

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
lay the unit on its back to do that but

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.720 
lay the unit on its back to do that but
this<00:03:16.750> is<00:03:16.810> a<00:03:16.930> storage<00:03:17.380> so<00:03:18.130> if<00:03:18.250> you<00:03:18.370> have<00:03:18.519> it<00:03:18.640> up

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
this is a storage so if you have it up

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.340 
this is a storage so if you have it up
against<00:03:19.090> a<00:03:19.150> wall<00:03:19.300> it's<00:03:19.810> probably<00:03:20.110> the<00:03:20.170> best

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
against a wall it's probably the best

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:21.890 
against a wall it's probably the best
place<00:03:20.590> to<00:03:20.620> do<00:03:20.890> it<00:03:21.010> so<00:03:21.370> let's<00:03:21.519> go<00:03:21.670> ahead

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
place to do it so let's go ahead

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.940 
place to do it so let's go ahead
basically<00:03:22.900> just<00:03:23.050> two<00:03:23.260> latches<00:03:23.440> on<00:03:23.920> either

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
basically just two latches on either

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:36.930 
basically just two latches on either
side<00:03:25.350> and<00:03:26.350> then<00:03:26.830> it<00:03:26.950> slides<00:03:27.160> out<00:03:34.680> and<00:03:35.940> you're

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
side and then it slides out and you're

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.420
