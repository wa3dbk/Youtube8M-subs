00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.680
 is the president for me will always be 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.130
 the president how are we 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.980
 Augustin Garcia 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:24.829
 josemarÃ­a that everything is so man every 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:28.009
 day hey every sunday I ask for you 

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:31.210
 every Sunday ask for me if I am 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:34.360
 You know I'm a player not called 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.670
 is to know how are these of telephone 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.579
 I now maintain a litigation that we are going to 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:42.160
 try to solve and for now I repeat in 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:45.340
 the one on the bench you how are you 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.090
 hey they told me you did not have almost it's a 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.879
 resolved 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:51.010
 we are trying to solve it you know 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:53.190
 that in the end we give the world cup 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.320
 antenna3 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.500
 and I think it is in the process of resolution 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.150
 because the other day I asked for you and I 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.490
 said look hey 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:07.200
 almost almost solved it's possible that 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:12.510
 yes but cycling 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:16.470
 carrasco a rafa without men that you do not 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.880
 called the heel with rafa 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.830
 I often behaved in general 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.830
 Barcelona is absolute fief 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:31.369
 I wonder how it is very good 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:33.360
 give him memories and memories he told me that 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:36.180
 a comment 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.710
 I believe that if they arrive, it awaits them to good 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.750
 port and you know that if you do not cross any 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.119
 suspicious bundle 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.580
 if we are in we are in the good line 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.330
 and about to resurrect for the media and 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.530
 to war again again if yes 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.520
 you know what happens that the empire's 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.240
 you know that they put a lot of tripping 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:57.540
 these fast and so on if you vote look 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.760
 very well you yes very well very calm 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.000
 seeing him 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:04.520
 what is happening how many will remember 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.320
 now to catch a used then think 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.780
 that from the first day I did not go to the 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.460
 box but not how much they were 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.530
 Missing how many will be 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.990
 remembering the eternal president 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.569
 but good is law of life this you know if 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:23.469
 be good you look too 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:27.120
 yes it is complicated to carry you know the 

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:27.120
 that has fallen to the good of johnito 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.500
 not to undo or total disaster 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.120
 there is no one who speaks peace 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.300
 notice that if I want to be benevolent 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.069
 I want to work and work generously 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.020
 but there are things that are not supported by 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:47.849
 their own weight these vices 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:52.650
 you talk to the doctor anymore you talk to the 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:57.180
 people inside if they say people you know 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:59.880
 if there was what is happening here 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.950
 the people that the people inside tell you 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.600
 firm flame but call me when the 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.590
 I do not want to talk to them 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:09.500
 who study retired the worldly noise 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.830
 not a statement because of course I do not 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.510
 I can go down to the ring because this is what 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:17.660
 I would like the press and I have you 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.400
 logically it is the food for the sect 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.700
 the food for war the food 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:25.010
 for for the carrion media like me 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:28.760
 I have not said anything or even done 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.500
 statements or anything you understand me 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.890
 so this park what do you think about 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.830
 van gaal 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.560
 I do not understand anything is not that I do not either 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.750
 I get it 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:43.130
 I do not understand absolutely nobody if 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:44.989
 cut the material without a few calls if I 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.000
 it seems that the battery is discharging your not 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:48.260
 you'll have no right van phone 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.750
 gaal 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:54.010
 Look, if you want, tomorrow I'll call you 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:56.360
 for my secretaries of the phones and 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.620
 where is it that I can not talk to the 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.750
 radio station because I can not 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.940
 for the station because I am also here 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.819
 the corrido one thing they do not call 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:07.160
 now my secretary who is in the 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:09.110
 dispatch and we ask him and if they have 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.000
 the perfect phones you say you 've 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.890
 talked to me I do not want to talk to him 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.730
 but you personally know that I am 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:18.040
 friend of luis xiv 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.510
 and then I want is that I do not understand 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.440
 I 'm not that I do not fit in the 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:25.030
 head joseph luis he called me and I 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.100
 said yes 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.810
 he asked for permission from the man I'm for 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.689
 on top of it 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:34.459
 good and evil and naturally now 

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:40.009
 he misses me because he said he talked to 

00:04:34.459 --> 00:04:45.349
 your lawyer directly from the surveys 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:47.479
 and I think it 's 63% of the polls 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:50.539
 good times voters tv3 but is that 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:52.399
 they want to burn it if something else today 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:55.069
 the cover of sports and the world 

00:04:52.399 --> 00:04:56.809
 sporting is the same if in which 

00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:59.419
 it is also incongruous with two 

00:04:56.809 --> 00:05:01.999
 newspapers on the same cover in but 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:03.259
 in big letters good and week already 

00:05:01.999 --> 00:05:05.059
 you know that also the means of 

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:06.550
 communication make strange companions 

00:05:05.059 --> 00:05:09.310
 of bed 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:11.350
 if last week the same cover 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.060
 also if this is fatal for a 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:15.460
 newspaper because if it does not show that 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.900
 make the covers according as it is 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:20.070
 which is what journalism has fallen into 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:23.640
 sporting that I so many times 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:27.090
 the sides the sects the other part 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:29.070
 I think maybe they want to distract the 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:31.350
 environment and they want to burn it again 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:33.960
 so that they would not say what nunez I say no 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:35.760
 because it does not fit me, it's not that I do not 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.730
 picture absolutely for nothing when 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:40.670
 It also has absolutely everything in 

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:43.080
 against if it's going to be an authentic 

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:45.990
 authentic chaos 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:48.180
 to the sports project with a hobby in 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:50.970
 against the media against 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:54.719
 I understand for sure all these means 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:57.870
 it was a targeted campaign and it's like a 

00:05:54.719 --> 00:06:00.300
 campaign absolutely because I was like 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:02.729
 now they will say the other way around for example 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:05.060
 I remember that gaspar that the other 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:07.250
 day of my 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:11.270
 just put it written last week 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:13.120
 vino vergas park or not yet convene 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:15.190
 elections 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:17.650
 he went out to the press and the first 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:20.650
 statements said that very well a 

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:23.229
 amateur to gaspar that the bank is 

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:26.260
 I had to go from Barcelona because if it is 

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:27.820
 that the gaspar the one that throws van gaal 

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.560
 and you think they have it done 

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:33.020
 so 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:34.460
 he told me that he had been called but what 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:38.660
 had done through the lawyer of 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:40.550
 luis de luis and I said I can not 

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:41.960
 speak through your lawyer but if it is 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:44.169
 that besides imposing on Luisa the feet 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.169
 of the horses 

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:53.430
 you think that with me 

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:54.800
 even though I will not go to the box or 

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:59.280
 although this is your coach 

00:06:54.800 --> 00:07:01.530
 obviously there is a barrier to see what 

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:03.390
 have we made a bet to see if you 

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:05.750
 You go before the boat from Barcelona or I 

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:09.240
 florentine box 

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:11.280
 Why are you going to lose it because I have not 

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:13.020
 heard once it was the day 

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.760
 drug but it has made me a parody 

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:16.410
 They say Garcia is bin Laden because 

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:19.000
 wants to throw Florentine towers 

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:21.910
 A) Yes 

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.940
 it is tremendous is tremendous is incredible 

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:26.440
 but this is how is this country today 

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:28.450
 see if one day we see each other to see if we 

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.900
 we see and we have time to talk long and 

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:31.289
 lying 

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:34.229
 the day they see Barcelona 

00:07:31.289 --> 00:07:36.240
 at any time if you call 

00:07:34.229 --> 00:07:42.419
 whenever we want to talk about but let's go 

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:44.039
 better to come and when I have the 

00:07:42.419 --> 00:07:46.229
 opportunity we organize but we 

00:07:44.039 --> 00:07:48.449
 we call you understand me yes sir we can 

00:07:46.229 --> 00:07:52.129
 talk about people quietly without 

00:07:48.449 --> 00:07:52.129
 problems now 

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:58.460
 thank you, good bye, goodbye president 

00:07:55.349 --> 00:07:58.460
 Mary hug
