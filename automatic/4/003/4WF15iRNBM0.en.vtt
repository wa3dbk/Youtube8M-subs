 because I used olive oil 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.800
 brown sugar because olive oil 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.240

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.460
 city ​​of skin and keeps its

 hydration and firmness and brown sugar 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.780
 it's a natural exfoliant so we 're going to 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.920
 Mix it well until it forms a 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.320
 pasta 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.880
 it's going to stay sometimes in lumps but 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.320
 you keep mixing and mixing until 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.530
 stay more or less as I am 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.530
 teaching 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.860
 The first thing I will do is pick me up 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.450
 the hair in a ponytail to have it out 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.430
 of the face that does not bother me while not 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.280
 is making the masks 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.930
 and now I'm going to put on my headband and I'm going 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.170
 to make sure it's tight for 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.939
 I will not stain hair 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.250
 I'm going to start putting on my mask 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:49.780
 exfoliating on the face and do not forget 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.490
 that we have to be delicate 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.080
 while we are not putting it the only thing 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.369
 what we are trying to do is to take away 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.150
 dead cells that we have in the 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:02:00.010
 surface of the skin 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.010
 avoid the area around the eyes 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.260
 do not forget to exfoliate the two 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.850
 lips and so they stay much softer 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.540
 and you remove all the dead skins that 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.540
 have in them 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.700
 once you have finished we clarify the 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.260
 face with your normal face soap and 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.680
 make sure that no residue remains 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.680
 on the skin 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.000
 for the moisturizing mask I have 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.340
 used coconut oil and cocoa in 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.630
 powder because he used coconut oil the 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.730
 coconut oil has properties 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.110
 antibacterials help maintain the 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.140
 hydrated skin and is full of 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.940
 antioxidants and cocoa helps the 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.040
 regeneration of skin cells and 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.390
 It has anti-inflammatory properties 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.700
 protects the skin from the sun's rays and 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.860
 is full of antioxidants are super 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.420
 good for the skin what are you going to do 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.610
 is to mix it until it is a paste 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.380
 like the one I'm teaching and when in 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.390
 how much is it like this just start 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.590
 apply oslo on the skin I'm going to 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.560
 start applying in movements 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:04.460
 circular and avoiding the area of 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:08.020
 around the eyes 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:11.290
 by the way the mask smells great 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:15.180
 I tried it because the coconut oil was 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.180
 can eat and tastes great 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.130
 once I had the mask 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.800
 scattered around the face I decided 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.510
 leave me the 15 minutes and then I gave 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.430
 mind that he did not have cucumbers in the kitchen 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.130
 and I decided to put two slices of potato 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.330
 that % the potatoes are very good because 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.880
 help reduce inflammation 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:37.130
 around the eyes and reduce 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:40.160
 dark circles so I let the mask 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:42.500
 potatoes 15 minutes and then I went to the 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.270
 bath and clear my face and the truth is 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.090
 that I felt a lot of difference to the 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:48.560
 face I felt super super soft no 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.030
 forget to put on your cream 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.060
 moisturizing right after taking us 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.739
 the masks 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.510
 Well , we are finished and I hope that 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:56.770
 I tried the masks and you already tell me 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:58.040
 these comments as it has come out 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:00.150

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.230
