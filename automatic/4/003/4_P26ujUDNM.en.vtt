three bucks so I'm gonna demonstration
of<00:00:20.490> how<00:00:20.699> it<00:00:20.910> works<00:00:21.210> I<00:00:21.539> actually<00:00:22.230> did<00:00:22.800> not<00:00:23.010> use

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
of how it works I actually did not use

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.939 
of how it works I actually did not use
the<00:00:23.699> micro<00:00:24.060> SD<00:00:24.480> card<00:00:24.779> that<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.199> kit<00:00:25.439> came<00:00:25.680> with

which is a 8 gigabyte samsung micro SD
card<00:00:29.699> insert<00:00:30.119> I<00:00:30.300> used<00:00:30.660> my<00:00:30.900> old<00:00:31.219> micro<00:00:32.219> SD<00:00:32.489> card

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
card insert I used my old micro SD card

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.910 
card insert I used my old micro SD card
that<00:00:32.910> I<00:00:33.149> took<00:00:33.510> it<00:00:33.630> out<00:00:33.750> from<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.140> phone<00:00:34.410> from<00:00:34.800> an

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
that I took it out from a phone from an

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.580 
that I took it out from a phone from an
Android<00:00:35.160> phone<00:00:35.520> so<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:36.750> installation<00:00:37.170> of

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
Android phone so the installation of

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.000 
Android phone so the installation of
raspbmc<00:00:38.370> or<00:00:38.910> XBMC<00:00:39.510> on<00:00:39.750> Raspberry<00:00:40.350> Pi<00:00:40.410> it's

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
raspbmc or XBMC on Raspberry Pi it's

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.660 
raspbmc or XBMC on Raspberry Pi it's
very<00:00:41.550> simple<00:00:42.180> for<00:00:42.780> Windows<00:00:43.410> at<00:00:43.590> least<00:00:43.829> there

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
very simple for Windows at least there

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.119 
very simple for Windows at least there
is<00:00:44.820> an<00:00:44.969> application<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.930> select<00:00:46.440> your<00:00:46.649> micro

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
is an application you select your micro

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.279 
is an application you select your micro
SD<00:00:47.489> card<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.120> installs<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:48.719> for<00:00:48.930> you<00:00:49.079> and

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
SD card and it installs it for you and

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.520 
SD card and it installs it for you and
then<00:00:50.039> one<00:00:50.550> problem<00:00:50.969> that<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.149> had<00:00:51.480> is<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:51.989> had<00:00:52.379> to

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
then one problem that I had is I had to

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.619 
then one problem that I had is I had to
delete<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:53.039> text<00:00:53.460> document<00:00:53.610> that's<00:00:54.149> called<00:00:54.510> the

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
delete a text document that's called the

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.160 
delete a text document that's called the
usb<00:00:55.260> on<00:00:55.469> my<00:00:55.920> micro<00:00:56.370> sd<00:00:56.820> card<00:00:56.850> for<00:00:57.600> some<00:00:57.870> reason

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
usb on my micro sd card for some reason

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.069 
usb on my micro sd card for some reason
when<00:00:58.320> I<00:00:58.350> formatted<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.129> micro<00:00:59.489> SD<00:00:59.879> card<00:01:00.270> it

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
when I formatted the micro SD card it

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.219 
when I formatted the micro SD card it
created<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.620> u<00:01:01.829> USB<00:01:02.640> so<00:01:03.030> it<00:01:03.300> was<00:01:03.480> recognizing

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
created a u USB so it was recognizing

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.160 
created a u USB so it was recognizing
the<00:01:04.350> micro<00:01:04.710> SD<00:01:05.100> card<00:01:05.400> as<00:01:05.549> a<00:01:05.580> USB<00:01:06.180> Drive<00:01:06.420> that's

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
the micro SD card as a USB Drive that's

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.320 
the micro SD card as a USB Drive that's
why<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.380> had<00:01:07.650> couple<00:01:08.010> problems<00:01:08.250> so<00:01:09.000> for<00:01:09.240> the

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
why I had couple problems so for the

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.260 
why I had couple problems so for the
installation<00:01:09.920> you<00:01:10.920> have<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.280> be<00:01:11.400> connected<00:01:11.670> to

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
installation you have to be connected to

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.990 
installation you have to be connected to
an<00:01:12.450> Ethernet<00:01:12.810> port<00:01:13.049> as<00:01:13.500> at<00:01:13.830> first<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.520> then

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
an Ethernet port as at first and then

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.760 
an Ethernet port as at first and then
you<00:01:15.150> could<00:01:15.299> take<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.659> out<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:15.990> plug<00:01:16.290> in<00:01:16.470> your

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
you could take it out and plug in your

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.649 
you could take it out and plug in your
802<00:01:17.520> 11<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:18.560> USB<00:01:19.560> adapter<00:01:20.430> so<00:01:20.909> right<00:01:21.090> now<00:01:21.299> I'm

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
802 11 and USB adapter so right now I'm

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.740 
802 11 and USB adapter so right now I'm
using<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.320> Kanaka<00:01:23.159> 2<00:01:23.340> USB<00:01:23.820> adapter<00:01:24.330> that<00:01:24.509> it

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
using the Kanaka 2 USB adapter that it

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.899 
using the Kanaka 2 USB adapter that it
the<00:01:25.049> kit<00:01:25.320> came<00:01:25.590> with<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:26.040> that<00:01:26.640> worked

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
the kit came with and that worked

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.450 
the kit came with and that worked
perfectly<00:01:27.450> after<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.409> installation<00:01:28.799> I<00:01:29.280> was

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
perfectly after the installation I was

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.550 
perfectly after the installation I was
able<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.820> connect<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.360> Wi-Fi<00:01:30.570> directly<00:01:31.380> and

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
able to connect to Wi-Fi directly and

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.929 
able to connect to Wi-Fi directly and
had<00:01:32.040> no<00:01:32.250> problem

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
had no problem

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.660 
had no problem
so<00:01:33.450> right<00:01:33.659> now<00:01:33.840> I'm<00:01:34.049> demoing<00:01:34.500> this<00:01:35.070> with<00:01:35.460> a

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
so right now I'm demoing this with a

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.289 
so right now I'm demoing this with a
1080p<00:01:36.420> monitor<00:01:36.630> it's<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.470> HP<00:01:37.619> Pavilion<00:01:38.520> in<00:01:38.850> 22

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
1080p monitor it's a HP Pavilion in 22

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.889 
1080p monitor it's a HP Pavilion in 22
BW<00:01:39.930> so<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:41.549> problem<00:01:42.000> with<00:01:42.119> this<00:01:42.299> monitor<00:01:42.540> is

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
BW so the problem with this monitor is

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.429 
BW so the problem with this monitor is
it<00:01:43.200> does<00:01:43.530> not<00:01:43.560> have<00:01:43.829> a<00:01:44.540> sound<00:01:45.540> output<00:01:45.899> or<00:01:46.409> a

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
it does not have a sound output or a

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.440 
it does not have a sound output or a
three<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.920> half<00:01:47.100> millimeter<00:01:47.579> jack<00:01:47.880> for<00:01:48.329> me

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
three and a half millimeter jack for me

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.450 
three and a half millimeter jack for me
to<00:01:48.630> output<00:01:49.049> sound<00:01:49.290> nor<00:01:49.770> does<00:01:50.040> it<00:01:50.070> have<00:01:50.220> his

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
to output sound nor does it have his

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.510 
to output sound nor does it have his
speaker<00:01:50.909> so<00:01:51.570> I<00:01:51.600> actually<00:01:51.899> had<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.320> use<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.680> 3.5

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
speaker so I actually had to use the 3.5

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.580 
speaker so I actually had to use the 3.5
millimeter<00:01:54.030> jack<00:01:54.420> that<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:55.049> Raspberry<00:01:55.530> Pi

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
millimeter jack that the Raspberry Pi

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.639 
millimeter jack that the Raspberry Pi
has<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.369> which<00:01:56.909> worked<00:01:57.149> perfectly<00:01:57.689> I<00:01:57.810> went<00:01:58.530> to

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
has and which worked perfectly I went to

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.859 
has and which worked perfectly I went to
settings<00:01:59.009> change<00:01:59.579> that<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.270> worked<00:02:00.570> fine

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
settings change that and it worked fine

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.679 
settings change that and it worked fine
there<00:02:01.140> was<00:02:01.290> no<00:02:01.530> problems<00:02:02.100> so<00:02:02.969> right<00:02:03.420> now<00:02:03.570> I'm

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
there was no problems so right now I'm

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.149 
there was no problems so right now I'm
going<00:02:03.810> to<00:02:03.869> give<00:02:03.990> you<00:02:04.110> a<00:02:04.200> demonstration<00:02:04.380> of<00:02:04.890> how

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
going to give you a demonstration of how

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.050 
going to give you a demonstration of how
well<00:02:05.430> it<00:02:05.610> works

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
well it works

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.570 
well it works
it<00:02:06.270> actually<00:02:06.450> works<00:02:06.899> really<00:02:07.020> well<00:02:07.710> it<00:02:08.280> seemed

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
it actually works really well it seemed

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.630 
it actually works really well it seemed
very<00:02:08.789> fast<00:02:09.509> very<00:02:09.840> fluid<00:02:10.649> but<00:02:11.129> there<00:02:11.370> was

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
very fast very fluid but there was

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.990 
very fast very fluid but there was
couple<00:02:12.000> crashes

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
couple crashes

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.300 
couple crashes
so<00:02:13.240> when<00:02:13.570> I<00:02:13.660> was<00:02:13.780> downloading<00:02:14.590> a<00:02:14.950> lot<00:02:15.190> of

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
so when I was downloading a lot of

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.790 
so when I was downloading a lot of
add-ons<00:02:15.760> you<00:02:16.240> could<00:02:16.690> get<00:02:16.840> add-on<00:02:17.170> such<00:02:17.500> as

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
add-ons you could get add-on such as

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.520 
add-ons you could get add-on such as
YouTube<00:02:18.430> seen<00:02:19.120> it<00:02:19.330> discovering<00:02:20.200> that<00:02:20.320> or

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
YouTube seen it discovering that or

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.490 
YouTube seen it discovering that or
something<00:02:21.370> that<00:02:21.550> you<00:02:21.700> could<00:02:21.970> see<00:02:22.270> stuff<00:02:22.600> on<00:02:22.810> so

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
something that you could see stuff on so

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.760 
something that you could see stuff on so
I<00:02:23.830> was<00:02:24.190> able<00:02:24.520> to<00:02:24.880> play<00:02:25.330> youtube<00:02:25.630> videos<00:02:25.840> but

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
I was able to play youtube videos but

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.550 
I was able to play youtube videos but
well<00:02:27.430> on<00:02:27.640> the<00:02:27.760> setting<00:02:28.150> it<00:02:28.480> crashed<00:02:28.930> multiple

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
well on the setting it crashed multiple

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.890 
well on the setting it crashed multiple
times<00:02:29.860> the<00:02:30.100> Raspberry<00:02:30.550> Pi<00:02:30.900> restarted

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
times the Raspberry Pi restarted

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.930 
times the Raspberry Pi restarted
automatically<00:02:32.680> which<00:02:33.130> was<00:02:33.370> not<00:02:33.580> a<00:02:33.610> big<00:02:33.910> deal

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
automatically which was not a big deal

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.720 
automatically which was not a big deal
but<00:02:34.510> it<00:02:34.720> was<00:02:34.900> kind<00:02:35.230> of<00:02:35.350> like<00:02:35.530> a<00:02:35.560> hassle<00:02:35.800> there

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
but it was kind of like a hassle there

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:37.950 
but it was kind of like a hassle there
Mon<00:02:36.910> beam<00:02:37.120> there<00:02:37.420> might<00:02:37.600> be<00:02:37.630> a<00:02:37.750> better

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
Mon beam there might be a better

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.680 
Mon beam there might be a better
software<00:02:38.920> update<00:02:39.370> coming<00:02:39.610> pretty<00:02:39.910> soon<00:02:40.000> which

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
software update coming pretty soon which

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.890 
software update coming pretty soon which
hopefully<00:02:41.410> doesn't<00:02:42.340> have<00:02:42.610> any<00:02:42.760> crashes<00:02:43.120> but

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
hopefully doesn't have any crashes but

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.750 
hopefully doesn't have any crashes but

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
hiccups or any problems there is ways to

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.580 
hiccups or any problems there is ways to
overclock<00:02:54.340> it<00:02:54.670> speaking<00:02:55.630> of<00:02:55.750> overclock<00:02:56.380> I

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
overclock it speaking of overclock I

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.470 
overclock it speaking of overclock I
noticed<00:02:57.010> something<00:02:57.340> very<00:02:57.370> cool<00:02:57.970> when<00:02:58.450> I

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
noticed something very cool when I

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.260 
noticed something very cool when I
downloaded<00:02:59.050> XBMC<00:02:59.709> if<00:03:00.190> you<00:03:00.610> go<00:03:00.820> to<00:03:00.880> hardware

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
downloaded XBMC if you go to hardware

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.630 
downloaded XBMC if you go to hardware
information<00:03:02.230> you<00:03:02.500> will<00:03:02.680> notice<00:03:03.130> that<00:03:03.160> the

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
information you will notice that the

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.220 
information you will notice that the
processor<00:03:04.240> is<00:03:04.570> clocked<00:03:05.200> at<00:03:05.910> 850<00:03:06.910> megahertz<00:03:07.240> so

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
processor is clocked at 850 megahertz so

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.490 
processor is clocked at 850 megahertz so
they<00:03:08.500> did<00:03:08.860> overclock<00:03:09.730> it<00:03:09.760> for<00:03:10.209> you<00:03:10.420> so<00:03:10.870> even<00:03:11.320> if

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
they did overclock it for you so even if

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.140 
they did overclock it for you so even if
you're<00:03:11.680> not<00:03:11.950> going<00:03:12.280> to<00:03:12.370> overclock<00:03:12.790> it<00:03:12.880> it's

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
you're not going to overclock it it's

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.870 
you're not going to overclock it it's
already<00:03:13.390> pre<00:03:13.810> overclocked<00:03:14.380> to<00:03:14.620> a<00:03:14.860> pretty<00:03:15.220> safe

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:15.880 
already pre overclocked to a pretty safe

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.850 
already pre overclocked to a pretty safe
overclock<00:03:16.660> where<00:03:16.900> you're<00:03:17.080> not<00:03:17.290> going<00:03:17.590> to<00:03:17.709> have

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
overclock where you're not going to have

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.850 
overclock where you're not going to have
any<00:03:18.010> overheating<00:03:18.790> or<00:03:18.910> crashing<00:03:19.810> problems<00:03:20.320> so

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
any overheating or crashing problems so

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.060 
any overheating or crashing problems so
what<00:03:21.190> can<00:03:21.400> you<00:03:21.459> do<00:03:21.730> with<00:03:21.940> XBMC<00:03:22.690> as<00:03:23.230> you<00:03:23.769> can<00:03:23.920> see

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
what can you do with XBMC as you can see

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:25.920 
what can you do with XBMC as you can see

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
now let's talk about how well it plays a

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.290 
now let's talk about how well it plays a
video<00:04:27.870> directly<00:04:28.710> from<00:04:28.950> like<00:04:29.400> a<00:04:29.430> USB<00:04:29.850> flash

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
video directly from like a USB flash

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.110 
video directly from like a USB flash
drive<00:04:30.630> so<00:04:31.230> I<00:04:31.260> connected<00:04:31.770> a<00:04:31.890> 16<00:04:32.280> gig<00:04:32.460> USB<00:04:32.610> flash

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.600 
drive so I connected a 16 gig USB flash
drive<00:04:33.450> that<00:04:33.750> contained<00:04:34.290> at<00:04:34.920> the<00:04:35.130> amazing

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
spider-man blu-ray Ref and it worked

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.000 
spider-man blu-ray Ref and it worked

as you could see the sound and the video

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:08.760 
as you could see the sound and the video
that's<00:05:07.270> coming<00:05:07.660> from<00:05:07.810> the<00:05:08.020> Raspberry<00:05:08.500> Pi<00:05:08.590> is

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
that's coming from the Raspberry Pi is

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.250 
that's coming from the Raspberry Pi is
not<00:05:09.190> bad<00:05:09.550> at<00:05:09.760> all<00:05:09.940> the<00:05:10.420> video<00:05:10.780> is<00:05:11.020> not

compressed at all I believe this is a

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.520 
compressed at all I believe this is a
1.83<00:05:14.740> gigabyte<00:05:15.490> file<00:05:15.790> and<00:05:16.150> it<00:05:16.840> played<00:05:17.200> really

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.530 
1.83 gigabyte file and it played really

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.070 
1.83 gigabyte file and it played really
well<00:05:17.710> there's<00:05:18.220> no<00:05:18.460> problem<00:05:18.970> the<00:05:19.150> 1080p<00:05:19.690> looks

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
well there's no problem the 1080p looks

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.560 
well there's no problem the 1080p looks
amazing<00:05:20.680> and<00:05:20.830> the<00:05:21.280> sounder<00:05:21.790> doesn't<00:05:22.210> have<00:05:22.390> any

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:22.570 
amazing and the sounder doesn't have any

amazing and the sounder doesn't have any
bad<00:05:22.950> amplification<00:05:23.950> so<00:05:24.990> Raspberry<00:05:25.990> Pi<00:05:26.050> is

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:26.410 
bad amplification so Raspberry Pi is

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:29.040 
bad amplification so Raspberry Pi is
amazing<00:05:27.100> but<00:05:27.730> would<00:05:28.060> I<00:05:28.090> recommend<00:05:28.540> it<00:05:28.840> as<00:05:29.020> a

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
amazing but would I recommend it as a

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.730 
amazing but would I recommend it as a
home<00:05:29.710> Media<00:05:30.070> Center<00:05:30.460> just<00:05:30.820> for<00:05:31.030> this<00:05:31.300> I'm<00:05:32.290> not

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:32.740 
home Media Center just for this I'm not

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.400 
home Media Center just for this I'm not
sure<00:05:33.130> but<00:05:33.610> if<00:05:33.850> you<00:05:34.000> want<00:05:34.330> to<00:05:34.480> be<00:05:34.600> able<00:05:34.750> to<00:05:35.050> tweak

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:35.410 
sure but if you want to be able to tweak

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:37.860 
sure but if you want to be able to tweak
things<00:05:35.710> try<00:05:36.160> other<00:05:36.400> things<00:05:36.850> there<00:05:37.330> is<00:05:37.570> more

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
things try other things there is more

update<00:05:38.380> coming<00:05:38.680> up<00:05:38.890> for<00:05:39.130> XBMC<00:05:39.730> that<00:05:40.480> hopefully

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
update coming up for XBMC that hopefully

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:42.870 
update coming up for XBMC that hopefully
works<00:05:41.110> better<00:05:41.470> and<00:05:41.740> don't<00:05:42.100> have<00:05:42.370> any<00:05:42.520> crashes

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 
works better and don't have any crashes

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.960 
works better and don't have any crashes
but<00:05:43.840> I<00:05:44.020> don't<00:05:44.169> think<00:05:44.260> this<00:05:44.470> is<00:05:44.500> gonna<00:05:44.970> replace

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:45.970 
but I don't think this is gonna replace

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.300 
but I don't think this is gonna replace
as<00:05:46.240> a<00:05:46.300> chromecast<00:05:46.840> there<00:05:47.680> is<00:05:47.800> more<00:05:48.040> things

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:48.310 
as a chromecast there is more things

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:50.580 
as a chromecast there is more things
that<00:05:48.490> you<00:05:48.610> could<00:05:48.790> do<00:05:49.000> at<00:05:49.180> this<00:05:49.480> but<00:05:49.960> chromecast

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:50.590 
that you could do at this but chromecast

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.950 
that you could do at this but chromecast
is<00:05:50.800> a<00:05:50.860> better<00:05:51.340> solution<00:05:51.640> for<00:05:52.030> just<00:05:52.540> Home<00:05:52.780> Media

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 
is a better solution for just Home Media

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.650 
is a better solution for just Home Media
Center<00:05:53.530> it's<00:05:54.040> gonna<00:05:54.250> work<00:05:54.520> better<00:05:54.880> you're<00:05:55.419> not

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:55.660 
Center it's gonna work better you're not

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.590
