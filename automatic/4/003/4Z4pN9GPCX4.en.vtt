00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.169
 a large restaurant chain guzman 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:25.410
 and today we will prepare the perfect 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:25.410
 steak 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.910
 you have my rib-steak there 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:47.330
 bumps into 5th to 13th rib 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:51.590
 this is a thick edge in Russian meat color 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:54.949
 the color of the meat as you see it has maybe 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:57.680
 be from dark red to light 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:00.410
 red can not be brown it is not 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.199
 maybe green it says o 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:07.130
 that the meat is a spoiled structure of it 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:08.869
 should be tight and should not 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:13.160
 fall apart i mean no meat should 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:18.470
 to be liquid the more fatty layers 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:21.259
 meat than it will be more succulent field 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.660
 delicious when you choose marble 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:30.170
 beef look to marbling was 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:32.149
 more if you want to fry at home then 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:36.070
 for this you need good 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:39.600
 frying pan with a good grooved 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:42.159
 corrugated surface put on the stove 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.229
 warmed up the maximum opportunity 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:46.810
 how much is the capacity of your stove 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:51.159
 apple then gives the maximum temperature 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:53.140
 280 degrees and then you put steak 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:55.240
 on the griddle previously worth 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.220
 a little smearing vegetable oil 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.500
 exactly vegetable piece vegetable 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.840
 sunflower oil it stands 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.840
 high heat extra vision if 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.220
 you take olive oil then after 180 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.100
 degrees the oil starts to burn 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.320
 carcinogens released 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:14.500
 laid on a griddle and forgotten exactly on 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.970
 one and a half minutes for all pores 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.110
 closed to go through the process 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.480
 caramelization 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.750
 and only after that you turn over 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.480
 on the other side of the state, also waiting 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.239
 one and a half minutes and further if you 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.250
 rippled griddle you make two more 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:34.810
 coup to give steak 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:37.300
 grill and shift or in the stove to 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.850
 for making steak that is when 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.070
 temperature of 200 degrees and if steak 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.130
 you are properly 2 and a half thick 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:47.290
 centimeters may be slightly higher 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:50.470
 harvest another three three four minutes 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:53.769
 to medium degree medium exists 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.750
 just six fires starting the lowest 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:03:00.280
 and then hot bloom when meat remains 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:03.790
 completely raw and temperature meat 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:06.760
 inside the steak 36 38 degrees farther 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:09.220
 roasting go rises and 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.980
 the difference between pro hot only 4 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:15.989
 we have 40 degrees of cooking paradise 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:19.570
 degrees 44 45 mass media we see it 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:22.360
 4850 44 45 is a medium vl. 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:25.840
 and the biggest cooking is that we had 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:28.450
 given when there is nothing left in the meat 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.209
 all meat is completely roasted 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:34.510
 comes out this is a roasting called aldan and 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:37.209
 temperature and and 59 60 degrees and this 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:40.239
 roasting does not recommend an important point 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:42.610
 after the steak we were roasting 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:46.600
 have to give a steak to rest i mean we 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:48.989
 got him and exactly a minute we have to 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.160
 wait for the sale which 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:54.160
 concentrated in the center of the steak he 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:57.400
 must go to all fiber and in 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.739
 rest time we already add salt pepper 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.910
 and grease a little butter 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:05.049
 the fact that give shine 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:06.100
 additional flavor steak salt and 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:08.380
 pepper at the end 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.570
 in any case, did not start and mash salt 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.280
 pulls out moisture and pepper we just 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:14.940
 at such a high temperature will burn 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.919
 after the steak we rested 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:20.290
 the steak needs to be cut cut and even 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:22.270
 in half to first check 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.610
 does the roast fit this 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.680
 steaks and stop cooking it 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.690
 further because the steak is closed 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.110
 temperature holds and roasts can 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.110
 go over
