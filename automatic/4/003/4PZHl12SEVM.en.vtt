here is the creeper now I was hoping

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:06.979 
here is the creeper now I was hoping
people<00:04:05.640> who<00:04:05.879> actually<00:04:06.060> have<00:04:06.450> some

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
people who actually have some

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.170 
people who actually have some
articulation<00:04:07.739> but<00:04:08.250> know<00:04:08.459> the<00:04:08.640> entire<00:04:08.909> polish

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
articulation but know the entire polish

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.690 
articulation but know the entire polish
just<00:04:09.269> sort<00:04:09.629> of<00:04:09.720> place<00:04:09.930> and<00:04:10.230> oh<00:04:11.069> look<00:04:11.400> you<00:04:11.549> gotta

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
just sort of place and oh look you gotta

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.670 
just sort of place and oh look you gotta
build<00:04:11.939> it<00:04:12.150> by<00:04:12.269> having<00:04:12.510> these<00:04:12.810> two<00:04:13.140> plates<00:04:13.470> on

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
build it by having these two plates on

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.920 
build it by having these two plates on
each<00:04:13.830> side<00:04:14.239> which<00:04:15.239> seems<00:04:15.569> absolutely

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
each side which seems absolutely

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:18.259 
each side which seems absolutely
pointless<00:04:16.410> I<00:04:17.190> know<00:04:17.459> look<00:04:17.729> it's<00:04:17.910> not<00:04:18.000> just<00:04:18.060> a

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
pointless I know look it's not just a

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.300 
pointless I know look it's not just a
single<00:04:18.479> solid<00:04:18.900> pieces<00:04:19.109> it's<00:04:19.440> three<00:04:19.739> solid

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
single solid pieces it's three solid

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.219 
single solid pieces it's three solid
pieces<00:04:20.570> that<00:04:21.570> could<00:04:21.720> have<00:04:21.810> been<00:04:21.870> a<00:04:21.930> single

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
pieces that could have been a single

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:22.730 
pieces that could have been a single
solid<00:04:22.410> piece

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
solid piece

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.790 
solid piece
totally<00:04:23.490> unnecessary

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
totally unnecessary

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.230 
totally unnecessary
work<00:04:25.069> I<00:04:25.400> know<00:04:25.490> this<00:04:25.759> is<00:04:25.849> a<00:04:25.879> solid<00:04:26.180> piece

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
work I know this is a solid piece

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.640 
work I know this is a solid piece
doesn't<00:04:26.509> move<00:04:26.599> but<00:04:26.720> he<00:04:26.780> looks<00:04:26.990> nice<00:04:27.199> but<00:04:27.440> it's

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
doesn't move but he looks nice but it's

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.610 
doesn't move but he looks nice but it's
essentially<00:04:28.159> just<00:04:28.190> a<00:04:28.400> statue<00:04:28.669> and<00:04:29.090> it<00:04:30.080> was<00:04:30.319> so

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
essentially just a statue and it was so

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:31.990 
essentially just a statue and it was so
much<00:04:30.800> better<00:04:30.860> if<00:04:31.129> I<00:04:31.190> can<00:04:31.340> actually<00:04:31.580> move<00:04:31.699> his

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
much better if I can actually move his

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.820 
much better if I can actually move his
feet<00:04:32.330> like<00:04:32.780> if<00:04:32.900> you<00:04:32.990> actually<00:04:33.139> build<00:04:33.530> the

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
feet like if you actually build the

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:36.659 
feet like if you actually build the
creeper<00:04:34.220> but<00:04:35.150> now<00:04:35.270> they<00:04:35.750> want<00:04:35.870> the<00:04:36.050> cheap<00:04:36.259> way

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669 
creeper but now they want the cheap way

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:40.230 
creeper but now they want the cheap way
but<00:04:37.669> at<00:04:37.819> least<00:04:37.909> the<00:04:38.090> head<00:04:38.240> still<00:04:38.599> nice<00:04:38.810> sort<00:04:39.740> of

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
but at least the head still nice sort of

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.020 
but at least the head still nice sort of
take<00:04:41.240> him<00:04:41.360> there<00:04:41.599> I<00:04:42.669> guess<00:04:43.669> if<00:04:43.879> you<00:04:44.000> really

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:44.030 
take him there I guess if you really

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.879 
take him there I guess if you really
want<00:04:44.449> to<00:04:44.690> save<00:04:44.960> your<00:04:45.080> doing<00:04:45.259> animation<00:04:45.770> you

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:45.889 
want to save your doing animation you

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:47.499 
want to save your doing animation you
would<00:04:46.009> take<00:04:46.129> them<00:04:46.250> photo<00:04:46.460> this<00:04:46.669> way<00:04:46.909> and<00:04:47.360> then

00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:47.509 
would take them photo this way and then

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:51.730 
would take them photo this way and then
one<00:04:47.690> for<00:04:47.840> the<00:04:47.870> towers<00:04:48.349> as<00:04:48.800> I<00:04:50.440> took<00:04:51.440> looks<00:04:51.590> like

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
one for the towers as I took looks like

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.580 
one for the towers as I took looks like
he's<00:04:51.889> walking<00:04:52.129> I<00:04:52.759> mean<00:04:53.629> really<00:04:53.870> annoying<00:04:54.409> good

00:05:00.459 --> 00:05:00.469 
it's so much simpler oh well so nothing

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:02.200 
it's so much simpler oh well so nothing

manual the easiest way to attach the
farm<00:06:59.210> said<00:06:59.600> you<00:07:00.170> should<00:07:00.350> just<00:07:00.470> do<00:07:00.650> this<00:07:00.830> and

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:01.610 
farm said you should just do this and

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:03.460 
farm said you should just do this and
just<00:07:01.790> slide<00:07:02.030> it<00:07:02.180> there<00:07:02.360> and<00:07:03.050> it's<00:07:03.230> meant<00:07:03.410> to

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:03.470 
just slide it there and it's meant to

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:05.920 
just slide it there and it's meant to
slide<00:07:03.980> together<00:07:04.280> into<00:07:04.550> a<00:07:04.580> bigger<00:07:04.820> piece<00:07:04.970> and<00:07:05.810> I

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:05.930 
slide together into a bigger piece and I

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:07.360 
slide together into a bigger piece and I
think<00:07:06.170> this<00:07:06.350> whole<00:07:06.560> piece<00:07:06.770> together<00:07:06.950> does

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:07.370 
think this whole piece together does

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:18.439 
think this whole piece together does
look<00:07:07.880> really<00:07:08.240> good

00:07:18.439 --> 00:07:18.449 

00:07:18.449 --> 00:07:20.509
