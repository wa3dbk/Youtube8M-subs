00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:06.360 

I<00:00:03.939> wanted<00:00:04.600> to<00:00:04.660> give<00:00:04.960> a<00:00:04.990> late-afternoon<00:00:05.439> tour

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:06.370 
I wanted to give a late-afternoon tour

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.750 
I wanted to give a late-afternoon tour
of<00:00:06.700> my<00:00:06.910> solar-powered<00:00:07.779> woodshed<00:00:08.410> I've<00:00:09.370> got<00:00:09.730> a

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:09.760 
of my solar-powered woodshed I've got a

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.660 
of my solar-powered woodshed I've got a
pretty<00:00:10.629> good<00:00:10.980> load<00:00:11.980> of<00:00:12.010> red<00:00:12.520> oak<00:00:12.789> inside<00:00:13.690> here

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
pretty good load of red oak inside here

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.060 
pretty good load of red oak inside here
started<00:00:15.670> stacking<00:00:16.510> around<00:00:17.050> the<00:00:17.230> outside<00:00:17.650> but

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:18.070 
started stacking around the outside but

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:19.980 
started stacking around the outside but
I'm<00:00:18.400> gonna<00:00:18.520> say<00:00:18.760> the<00:00:18.970> rest<00:00:19.180> of<00:00:19.359> the<00:00:19.449> stacking

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:19.990 
I'm gonna say the rest of the stacking

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.830 
I'm gonna say the rest of the stacking
for<00:00:20.290> a<00:00:20.320> rainy<00:00:20.830> day<00:00:21.540> the<00:00:22.830> roof<00:00:23.830> is<00:00:24.450> made<00:00:25.450> from<00:00:25.660> a

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:25.840 
for a rainy day the roof is made from a

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.070 
for a rainy day the roof is made from a
couple<00:00:26.050> of<00:00:26.350> sheets<00:00:26.980> of<00:00:27.190> plexiglass<00:00:28.080> that

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:29.080 
couple of sheets of plexiglass that

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.200 
couple of sheets of plexiglass that
turned<00:00:29.350> out<00:00:29.530> to<00:00:29.680> be<00:00:29.830> a<00:00:29.860> pretty<00:00:30.820> pricey<00:00:31.180> item

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
turned out to be a pretty pricey item

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.930 
turned out to be a pretty pricey item
overall<00:00:34.320> I'm<00:00:35.320> not<00:00:35.530> sure<00:00:36.100> whether<00:00:36.460> the<00:00:36.699> cost

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
overall I'm not sure whether the cost

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:42.239 
overall I'm not sure whether the cost
has<00:00:37.179> really<00:00:37.480> been<00:00:37.629> worth<00:00:37.899> it<00:00:38.140> or<00:00:38.260> not<00:00:38.289> I've<00:00:41.249> had

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:42.249 
has really been worth it or not I've had

00:00:42.249 --> 00:00:44.219 
has really been worth it or not I've had
this<00:00:42.460> for<00:00:42.670> 20<00:00:42.999> years<00:00:43.030> and<00:00:43.420> I<00:00:43.659> think<00:00:43.719> it's<00:00:44.019> done

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:44.229 
this for 20 years and I think it's done

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:45.719 
this for 20 years and I think it's done
okay

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:45.729 
okay

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:47.880 
okay
the<00:00:46.149> temperature<00:00:46.600> inside<00:00:46.899> will<00:00:47.469> typically

the temperature inside will typically

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.809 
the temperature inside will typically
get<00:00:48.190> up<00:00:48.370> to<00:00:48.609> be<00:00:48.789> about<00:00:49.569> 30<00:00:50.019> to<00:00:50.260> 40<00:00:50.679> degrees

get up to be about 30 to 40 degrees
warmer<00:00:51.819> than<00:00:52.629> the<00:00:52.929> temperature<00:00:53.379> outside<00:00:53.530> on<00:00:54.219> a

warmer than the temperature outside on a

00:00:54.249 --> 00:00:58.770 
warmer than the temperature outside on a
sunny<00:00:54.670> day<00:00:55.229> but<00:00:56.229> the<00:00:56.620> mass<00:00:57.429> the<00:00:57.940> thermal<00:00:58.569> mass

sunny day but the mass the thermal mass

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.430 
sunny day but the mass the thermal mass
of<00:00:59.139> the<00:00:59.260> wood<00:00:59.670> doesn't<00:01:00.670> react<00:01:01.179> that<00:01:01.749> well<00:01:02.139> to

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
of the wood doesn't react that well to

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.880 
of the wood doesn't react that well to
that<00:01:02.620> heat<00:01:02.979> input<00:01:03.360> the<00:01:04.360> air<00:01:04.570> does<00:01:05.019> and<00:01:05.530> that's

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
that heat input the air does and that's

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.889 
that heat input the air does and that's
one<00:01:06.220> positive<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.840> hot<00:01:08.829> air<00:01:09.600> being<00:01:10.600> a<00:01:10.719> lot

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:10.899 
one positive the hot air being a lot

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:14.609 
one positive the hot air being a lot
less<00:01:10.930> dense<00:01:11.530> tends<00:01:12.340> to<00:01:12.549> find<00:01:12.789> ways<00:01:13.090> to<00:01:13.619> force

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:14.619 
less dense tends to find ways to force

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:18.569 
less dense tends to find ways to force
itself<00:01:15.100> out<00:01:15.640> of<00:01:16.030> the<00:01:16.210> cracks<00:01:16.990> and<00:01:17.380> the<00:01:17.590> the<00:01:18.340> few

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:18.579 
itself out of the cracks and the the few

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:22.920 
itself out of the cracks and the the few
small<00:01:18.969> openings<00:01:19.659> that<00:01:19.990> are<00:01:20.969> in<00:01:21.969> the<00:01:22.270> shed<00:01:22.570> and

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
small openings that are in the shed and

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.349 
small openings that are in the shed and
so<00:01:23.380> there's<00:01:23.649> a<00:01:23.740> constant<00:01:24.130> circulation<00:01:24.820> of<00:01:25.180> air

00:01:25.349 --> 00:01:25.359 
so there's a constant circulation of air

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:28.910 
so there's a constant circulation of air
so<00:01:26.200> you<00:01:26.259> get<00:01:26.649> the<00:01:26.829> dryer<00:01:27.100> outside<00:01:27.729> here<00:01:28.000> and

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
so you get the dryer outside here and

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.510 
so you get the dryer outside here and
that<00:01:30.479> air<00:01:31.479> that's<00:01:31.990> going<00:01:32.079> out<00:01:32.590> has<00:01:33.250> been

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
that air that's going out has been

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.399 
that air that's going out has been
heated<00:01:33.880> up<00:01:34.030> and<00:01:34.240> sucks<00:01:34.509> some<00:01:34.750> of<00:01:34.869> the<00:01:34.960> moisture

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
heated up and sucks some of the moisture

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:38.669 
heated up and sucks some of the moisture
out<00:01:35.469> of<00:01:35.590> the<00:01:35.799> wood<00:01:36.070> so<00:01:36.909> I<00:01:36.939> think<00:01:37.509> it's<00:01:37.679> fairly

00:01:38.669 --> 00:01:38.679 
out of the wood so I think it's fairly

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:41.099 
out of the wood so I think it's fairly
effective<00:01:39.310> but<00:01:39.640> not<00:01:39.909> as<00:01:40.149> effective<00:01:40.659> as<00:01:40.810> I<00:01:40.960> was

00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:41.109 
effective but not as effective as I was

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:42.840 
effective but not as effective as I was
hoping<00:01:41.500> because<00:01:41.710> I<00:01:41.799> was<00:01:41.890> really<00:01:42.039> hoping<00:01:42.579> it

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
hoping because I was really hoping it

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.090 
hoping because I was really hoping it
would<00:01:43.390> get<00:01:43.719> hot<00:01:43.929> enough<00:01:44.259> so<00:01:44.320> that<00:01:44.710> it<00:01:44.859> could

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
would get hot enough so that it could

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.050 
would get hot enough so that it could
cook<00:01:45.670> all<00:01:46.149> of<00:01:46.479> the<00:01:46.630> wood<00:01:46.869> but<00:01:47.859> it<00:01:48.490> doesn't<00:01:48.880> seem

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
cook all of the wood but it doesn't seem

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.289 
cook all of the wood but it doesn't seem
to<00:01:49.210> do<00:01:49.359> that<00:01:49.859> so<00:01:50.859> I<00:01:51.219> don't<00:01:51.700> know<00:01:51.820> whether<00:01:52.060> this

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299 
to do that so I don't know whether this

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:55.560 
to do that so I don't know whether this
would<00:01:52.479> be<00:01:52.600> an<00:01:52.719> idea<00:01:52.990> that<00:01:53.399> you<00:01:54.399> would<00:01:54.579> like<00:01:54.820> I'm

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
would be an idea that you would like I'm

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.319 
would be an idea that you would like I'm
satisfied<00:01:56.109> with<00:01:56.499> it<00:01:56.920> but<00:01:57.189> I<00:01:57.429> won't<00:01:58.030> say<00:01:58.299> that

00:01:58.319 --> 00:01:58.329 
satisfied with it but I won't say that

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:02.969 
satisfied with it but I won't say that
it's<00:01:58.689> a<00:01:59.130> wonderful<00:02:00.130> idea
