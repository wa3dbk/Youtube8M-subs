00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
that you may have fought earlier if you

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.720 
that you may have fought earlier if you

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
think he just might be a little bit

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.689 
think he just might be a little bit
stronger<00:00:17.730> and<00:00:18.650> in<00:00:19.650> terms<00:00:19.830> of<00:00:19.980> health<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:20.460> do<00:00:20.670> a

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
stronger and in terms of health and do a

stronger and in terms of health and do a
little<00:00:20.789> bit<00:00:20.939> more<00:00:21.090> damage<00:00:21.300> in<00:00:21.660> terms<00:00:21.869> of<00:00:22.109> like

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
little bit more damage in terms of like

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.529

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
that kind of knocks everything back and

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.650 
that kind of knocks everything back and
