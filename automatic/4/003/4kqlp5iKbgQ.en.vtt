00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
board just as a buffer from the hot wax

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.429 
board just as a buffer from the hot wax
that's<00:01:04.019> about<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.439> be<00:01:04.559> dripped<00:01:04.890> on<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:06.439> and

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
that's about to be dripped on to it and

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.080 
that's about to be dripped on to it and
then<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:07.740> just<00:01:07.950> want<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.280> take<00:01:08.520> it<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.850> apply

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
then you just want to take it and apply

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.789 
then you just want to take it and apply

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
it to the iron get it to running and

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:17.270 
it to the iron get it to running and
start<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:13.979> drip<00:01:14.250> it<00:01:14.400> on<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.840> board<00:01:16.140> keep<00:01:17.070> in

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
start to drip it on to the board keep in

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.120 
start to drip it on to the board keep in
mind<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:18.000> more<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.479> drip<00:01:18.750> on<00:01:18.990> here<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.860> more

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
mind the more you drip on here the more

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
mind the more you drip on here the more
you're<00:01:20.369> going<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.700> have<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:21.119> scrape<00:01:21.450> off<00:01:21.810> and

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
you're going to have to scrape off and

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.660 
you're going to have to scrape off and
scraping<00:01:24.150> is<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.299> pain<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:25.080> it's<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.159> messy

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
scraping is a pain and it's a messy

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.249 
scraping is a pain and it's a messy
process<00:01:28.520> so<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.579> want<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:29.970> use<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.780> minimum

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
process so you want to use the minimum

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.120 
process so you want to use the minimum
amount<00:01:31.590> of<00:01:31.710> wax<00:01:32.930> necessary<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:34.229> coat<00:01:34.530> the

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
amount of wax necessary to coat the

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.300 
amount of wax necessary to coat the
entire<00:01:35.189> base<00:01:35.909> of<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.270> board

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310

that<00:01:42.210> ought<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.840> do<00:01:43.170> it<00:01:43.850> now<00:01:44.850> most<00:01:45.390> important

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
that ought to do it now most important

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.620 
that ought to do it now most important
factor<00:01:46.740> when<00:01:46.979> it<00:01:47.340> comes<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.970> waxing<00:01:48.450> your

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
board is keeping the iron moving you

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.029 
board is keeping the iron moving you
never<00:01:52.140> ever<00:01:52.829> ever<00:01:53.640> want<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.750> let<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.229> iron<00:01:55.500> sit

00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:56.039 
never ever ever want to let the iron sit

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:59.840 
never ever ever want to let the iron sit
still<00:01:56.880> on<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.600> board<00:01:57.840> if<00:01:58.740> it<00:01:59.070> gets<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.580> the

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
base of the board gets too hot it will

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.249 
base of the board gets too hot it will
separate<00:02:02.640> from<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.179> core<00:02:03.539> of<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.750> board<00:02:04.049> and

separate from the core of the board and

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.210 
separate from the core of the board and
you<00:02:04.860> have<00:02:05.220> ruined<00:02:05.490> your<00:02:05.850> snowboard<00:02:06.390> so

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
you have ruined your snowboard so

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.410 
you have ruined your snowboard so
constantly<00:02:08.220> moving<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.899> board<00:02:10.700> the<00:02:11.700> iron<00:02:11.910> we

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
constantly moving the board the iron we

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.830 
constantly moving the board the iron we
want<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:12.780> just<00:02:15.110> get<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.319> wax<00:02:16.819> liquefied<00:02:17.840> and

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
want to just get the wax liquefied and

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.199 
want to just get the wax liquefied and
once<00:02:19.440> you<00:02:19.590> get<00:02:19.739> it<00:02:19.860> liquefied<00:02:20.400> you<00:02:20.700> can<00:02:20.880> move

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
once you get it liquefied you can move

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.840 
once you get it liquefied you can move

board<00:03:05.250> is<00:03:05.989> your<00:03:06.989> heating<00:03:07.380> up<00:03:07.530> the<00:03:07.560> base<00:03:07.950> and<00:03:08.549> by

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
board is your heating up the base and by

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.509 
board is your heating up the base and by
heating<00:03:09.630> up<00:03:09.870> the<00:03:09.900> base<00:03:10.230> you<00:03:10.560> cause<00:03:10.829> the<00:03:11.100> pores

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
heating up the base you cause the pores

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.349 
heating up the base you cause the pores
in<00:03:11.880> the<00:03:11.910> base<00:03:12.180> to<00:03:12.840> open<00:03:13.380> up<00:03:13.560> or<00:03:13.799> expand<00:03:14.459> and

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:15.359 
in the base to open up or expand and

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:21.110 
in the base to open up or expand and
that<00:03:15.630> allows<00:03:16.139> the<00:03:16.829> wax<00:03:17.420> to<00:03:18.889> enter<00:03:19.889> into<00:03:20.459> the

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
that allows the wax to enter into the

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.349 
that allows the wax to enter into the
base<00:03:21.329> on<00:03:21.630> a<00:03:21.660> molecular<00:03:22.440> level<00:03:22.769> actually<00:03:23.609> and

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:26.359 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:30.140 

then<00:03:27.359> as<00:03:27.600> the<00:03:27.810> board<00:03:28.109> cools<00:03:28.670> those<00:03:29.670> pores

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
then as the board cools those pores

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.900 
then as the board cools those pores
closed<00:03:30.569> up<00:03:30.980> capturing<00:03:31.980> that<00:03:32.220> wax<00:03:32.579> and

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
closed up capturing that wax and

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.720 
closed up capturing that wax and
containing<00:03:33.750> it<00:03:34.049> into<00:03:34.410> the<00:03:34.500> base<00:03:34.709> which<00:03:35.400> gives

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
containing it into the base which gives

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.710 
containing it into the base which gives
you<00:03:35.910> your<00:03:36.060> sliding<00:03:36.420> surface

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
you your sliding surface

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.830 
you your sliding surface
so<00:03:39.380> once<00:03:39.710> you<00:03:39.920> get<00:03:40.100> it<00:03:40.250> all<00:03:40.460> done<00:03:40.910> you<00:03:41.480> butter

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
so once you get it all done you butter

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.200 
so once you get it all done you butter
it<00:03:42.050> out<00:03:42.200> smooth<00:03:42.950> it<00:03:43.280> out<00:03:43.400> make<00:03:43.970> sure<00:03:44.000> it's

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:44.210 
it out smooth it out make sure it's

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:57.150 
it out smooth it out make sure it's
evenly<00:03:44.870> heated

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.640 

that's<00:03:58.160> it<00:03:58.570> now<00:03:59.570> you're<00:03:59.780> going<00:03:59.960> to<00:04:00.020> let<00:04:00.200> board

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
that's it now you're going to let board

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.000 
that's it now you're going to let board
cool<00:04:01.070> back<00:04:01.940> to<00:04:02.210> room<00:04:02.390> temperature<00:04:02.840> if<00:04:03.230> you<00:04:03.830> can
