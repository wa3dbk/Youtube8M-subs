00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.430 

over<00:00:00.829> here<00:00:02.389> has<00:00:03.389> a<00:00:03.419> rupture<00:00:03.810> at<00:00:03.959> some<00:00:04.110> point<00:00:04.319> in

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
over here has a rupture at some point in

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.050 
over here has a rupture at some point in
time<00:00:04.589> and<00:00:04.950> so<00:00:05.009> what<00:00:05.250> you've<00:00:05.430> got<00:00:05.460> there<00:00:05.850> is

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
time and so what you've got there is

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.470 
time and so what you've got there is
sort<00:00:06.270> of<00:00:06.299> a<00:00:06.420> healed<00:00:06.690> bulla<00:00:08.150> fluid-filled<00:00:09.150> sac

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
sort of a healed bulla fluid-filled sac

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.270 
sort of a healed bulla fluid-filled sac
that's<00:00:09.719> it<00:00:09.870> in<00:00:09.960> there<00:00:10.110> and<00:00:10.230> behind<00:00:10.590> the<00:00:10.950> brown

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
that's it in there and behind the brown

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.440 
that's it in there and behind the brown
that<00:00:11.460> you<00:00:11.550> can<00:00:11.670> actually<00:00:11.820> see<00:00:12.179> is<00:00:12.630> a<00:00:13.549> a<00:00:14.549> sheet

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
that you can actually see is a a sheet

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.200 
that you can actually see is a a sheet
of<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.870> iris<00:00:16.320> that's<00:00:16.529> formed<00:00:16.949> kind<00:00:17.760> of<00:00:17.880> in<00:00:18.119> a

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
of the iris that's formed kind of in a

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.660 
of the iris that's formed kind of in a
response<00:00:18.570> to<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:18.900> rupture<00:00:19.260> unfortunately<00:00:20.130> so

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
response to the rupture unfortunately so

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.599 
response to the rupture unfortunately so
that<00:00:21.660> I<00:00:21.689> will<00:00:22.560> never<00:00:22.680> see<00:00:23.220> again<00:00:23.250> it's

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
that I will never see again it's

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.519 
that I will never see again it's
comfortable<00:00:24.150> more<00:00:24.720> than<00:00:24.840> likely<00:00:25.019> it's<00:00:25.380> not<00:00:25.439> a

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
comfortable more than likely it's not a

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.259 
comfortable more than likely it's not a
painful<00:00:25.830> condition<00:00:26.369> right<00:00:26.519> now<00:00:26.580> but<00:00:26.939> it's<00:00:27.060> not

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
painful condition right now but it's not

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.320 
painful condition right now but it's not
anything<00:00:27.599> that's<00:00:27.810> gonna<00:00:28.710> be<00:00:28.890> salvageable<00:00:29.330> the

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
anything that's gonna be salvageable the

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.860 
anything that's gonna be salvageable the
left<00:00:30.779> eye<00:00:31.430> appears<00:00:32.430> bigger<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.329> me<00:00:33.450> than<00:00:33.480> what

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
left eye appears bigger to me than what

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.569 
left eye appears bigger to me than what
it<00:00:33.989> should<00:00:34.200> be<00:00:34.230> for<00:00:34.350> this<00:00:34.710> sort<00:00:35.070> of<00:00:35.130> size<00:00:35.340> of

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
it should be for this sort of size of

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.370 
it should be for this sort of size of
dog<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:35.940> so<00:00:36.149> my<00:00:36.329> worry<00:00:36.540> would<00:00:36.780> be<00:00:36.960> is<00:00:37.140> that

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
dog and so my worry would be is that

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.400 
dog and so my worry would be is that
there<00:00:38.010> there<00:00:38.399> has<00:00:38.790> been<00:00:39.120> glaucoma<00:00:40.050> at<00:00:40.230> some

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
there there has been glaucoma at some

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.600 
there there has been glaucoma at some
point<00:00:40.590> in<00:00:40.680> time<00:00:40.710> whether<00:00:40.980> it's<00:00:41.129> active<00:00:41.460> or<00:00:41.550> not

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
point in time whether it's active or not

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.160 
point in time whether it's active or not
is<00:00:41.820> difficult<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.329> say<00:00:42.510> because<00:00:42.750> what's

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
is difficult to say because what's

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.650 
is difficult to say because what's
happened<00:00:43.530> is<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.739> cornea<00:00:44.129> is<00:00:45.000> complete

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
happened is the cornea is complete

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.180 
happened is the cornea is complete
granulation<00:00:46.230> tissue<00:00:46.260> mean<00:00:46.710> all<00:00:46.860> those<00:00:47.010> blood

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
granulation tissue mean all those blood

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.209 
granulation tissue mean all those blood
vessels<00:00:47.219> are<00:00:47.610> grown<00:00:47.789> in<00:00:48.260> and<00:00:49.260> so<00:00:49.680> as<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.070> result

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
vessels are grown in and so as a result

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.279 
vessels are grown in and so as a result
of<00:00:50.489> that<00:00:50.579> we<00:00:50.730> can't<00:00:51.030> measure<00:00:51.239> with<00:00:51.780> our<00:00:51.960> device

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
of that we can't measure with our device

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.840 
of that we can't measure with our device
the<00:00:53.070> pressure<00:00:53.280> because<00:00:53.550> we're<00:00:53.670> measuring

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
the pressure because we're measuring

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.119 
the pressure because we're measuring
against<00:00:54.300> abnormal<00:00:54.750> tissue<00:00:54.989> that<00:00:55.680> makes<00:00:55.890> sense

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
against abnormal tissue that makes sense

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.310 
against abnormal tissue that makes sense
so<00:00:57.120> it's<00:00:57.210> basically<00:00:57.420> grown<00:00:57.690> over<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.989> front

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
so it's basically grown over the front

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.889 
so it's basically grown over the front
yeah<00:00:59.090> everything<00:01:00.090> anything<00:01:00.300> I<00:01:00.570> can't<00:01:00.719> see

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
yeah everything anything I can't see

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.150 
yeah everything anything I can't see
anything<00:01:01.140> on<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.410> by<00:01:01.530> their<00:01:01.739> eye<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:02.070> I<00:01:02.129> think

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
anything on the by their eye and I think

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.280 
anything on the by their eye and I think
prognostically<00:01:03.030> being<00:01:03.329> is<00:01:03.600> that<00:01:03.629> she<00:01:03.930> will

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
prognostically being is that she will

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.289 
prognostically being is that she will
probably<00:01:04.500> never<00:01:04.739> be<00:01:04.920> visual<00:01:05.460> today<00:01:06.000> I<00:01:06.030> need<00:01:06.240> to

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
probably never be visual today I need to

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.179 
probably never be visual today I need to
be<00:01:06.390> removed<00:01:06.689> so<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.619> know<00:01:07.710> I<00:01:07.740> think<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.010> right

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
be removed so you know I think the right

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.130 
be removed so you know I think the right
eye<00:01:08.220> is<00:01:08.400> something<00:01:08.970> that<00:01:09.119> probably<00:01:09.330> doesn't

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
eye is something that probably doesn't

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.100 
eye is something that probably doesn't
defend<00:01:10.590> lean<00:01:10.830> groove<00:01:11.159> right<00:01:11.460> now<00:01:11.900> the<00:01:12.900> left

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
defend lean groove right now the left

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.690 
defend lean groove right now the left
eye<00:01:13.290> is<00:01:13.350> more<00:01:13.770> than<00:01:13.860> likely<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.189> eye<00:01:14.340> that

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
eye is more than likely the eye that

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.940 
eye is more than likely the eye that
would<00:01:14.850> look<00:01:15.509> at<00:01:15.659> because<00:01:16.500> it's<00:01:16.680> overexposed

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
would look at because it's overexposed

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.120 
would look at because it's overexposed
right<00:01:17.670> it's<00:01:17.820> like<00:01:17.909> this<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.360> whole<00:01:18.390> time

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
right it's like this the whole time

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.100 
right it's like this the whole time
honestly<00:01:20.130> infection<00:01:21.000> in<00:01:21.119> there<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.930> biggest

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
honestly infection in there the biggest

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.740 
honestly infection in there the biggest
thing<00:01:22.409> though<00:01:22.619> is<00:01:22.860> I<00:01:22.979> think<00:01:23.270> because<00:01:24.270> of<00:01:24.450> her

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
thing though is I think because of her

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.420 
thing though is I think because of her
like<00:01:25.380> we're<00:01:25.530> speaking<00:01:25.710> out<00:01:25.860> there<00:01:26.070> I<00:01:26.220> was

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
like we're speaking out there I was

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.160 
like we're speaking out there I was
worried<00:01:26.670> about<00:01:26.700> what<00:01:27.060> other<00:01:27.210> diseases<00:01:27.900> she

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
worried about what other diseases she

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.480 
worried about what other diseases she
might<00:01:28.320> have<00:01:28.439> concurrently<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.130> I<00:01:29.220> wouldn't

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
might have concurrently and I wouldn't

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:37.539 
might have concurrently and I wouldn't
rush<00:01:30.329> into<00:01:30.540> getting<00:01:30.659> her<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.170> surgery<00:01:32.990> yeah

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:39.859 

yes<00:01:38.549> Mitch<00:01:38.820> you<00:01:39.030> have<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.299> be<00:01:39.390> on<00:01:39.479> doxycycline

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
yes Mitch you have to be on doxycycline

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.730 
yes Mitch you have to be on doxycycline
for<00:01:40.619> 30<00:01:41.130> days<00:01:41.450> at<00:01:42.450> least<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:43.049> make<00:01:43.500> sure<00:01:43.680> she

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
for 30 days at least and make sure she

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.830 
for 30 days at least and make sure she
doesn't<00:01:43.890> have<00:01:44.189> heartworm<00:01:45.119> disease<00:01:45.210> any<00:01:45.630> other

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
doesn't have heartworm disease any other

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.969 
doesn't have heartworm disease any other
system<00:01:46.350> of<00:01:46.439> gambling

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
system of gambling

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:52.249 
system of gambling
what<00:01:47.189> do<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.369> think<00:01:47.579> she<00:01:47.759> is<00:01:51.140> through<00:01:52.140> the

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
what do you think she is through the

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.370 
what do you think she is through the
lens<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.770> then<00:01:52.890> I'll<00:01:53.220> be<00:01:53.340> honest<00:01:53.670> 13<00:01:54.380> she's

I<00:02:08.550> was<00:02:09.150> I<00:02:09.890> think<00:02:10.890> I<00:02:11.250> worry<00:02:11.460> about<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.730> eye<00:02:11.760> just

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
I was I think I worry about the eye just

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.370 
I was I think I worry about the eye just
because<00:02:12.360> of<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.570> number<00:02:12.780> of<00:02:12.840> ticks<00:02:13.020> on<00:02:13.200> their

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
because of the number of ticks on their

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.140 
because of the number of ticks on their
eyes<00:02:13.560> Oliver<00:02:14.040> what<00:02:14.220> tick-borne<00:02:14.550> disease<00:02:14.910> and

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
eyes Oliver what tick-borne disease and

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.550 
eyes Oliver what tick-borne disease and
so<00:02:15.240> I<00:02:15.270> get<00:02:15.510> this<00:02:15.600> inflammation<00:02:16.200> inside<00:02:16.320> the

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
so I get this inflammation inside the

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.260 
so I get this inflammation inside the
eye<00:02:16.590> called<00:02:16.950> uveitis<00:02:17.250> and<00:02:17.850> the<00:02:17.910> uveitis

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
eye called uveitis and the uveitis

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.380 
eye called uveitis and the uveitis
causes<00:02:18.990> a<00:02:19.590> bunch<00:02:20.280> of<00:02:20.430> protein<00:02:20.880> inside<00:02:21.210> the<00:02:21.360> eye

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
causes a bunch of protein inside the eye

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.930 
causes a bunch of protein inside the eye
that<00:02:21.720> then<00:02:21.840> builds<00:02:22.110> a<00:02:22.170> book<00:02:22.320> coma<00:02:22.920> then<00:02:23.760> they

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
that then builds a book coma then they

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.180 
that then builds a book coma then they
get<00:02:24.090> irritated<00:02:27.350> which<00:02:28.350> came<00:02:28.590> first<00:02:28.800> that's<00:02:29.070> a
