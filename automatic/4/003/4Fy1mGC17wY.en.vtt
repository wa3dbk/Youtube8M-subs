00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 Hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.029
 I am a byte and this is another video from the heading 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.410
 how to counter 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:10.019
 she will be devoted to such a character to 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.150
 courses I personally have been very lately 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.610
 rarely see him in games however very 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.210
 many people wonder how is it 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.520
 counter 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.820
 Now I will try to answer it 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.850
 went to answer the canons of this category 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.099
 First, we define the main disadvantages 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:28.320
 first course is not very mobile character 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.670
 pretty serious flaw which 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.480
 in every possible way tries to eliminate with the help 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.969
 Blinka purchases and tara deeds are the second of 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.309
 the first is named by us minus implies 2 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.710
 The weak side of this hero is this 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.329
 artifact dependency really 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.730
 if you truncate quickly do not farm at least 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.440
 dreams of their main subjects is big 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.200
 part of the family will be extremely vulnerable and without 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.539
 help against enemies 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:54.960
 3 well kite and x times with 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.850
 Renji centuries 4 sides and most useful 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.559
 hero mass fights as the course 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.230
 specializes in country killing you 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:05.070
 single target and vulnerable to all kinds 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.840
 design looking at these cons is already clear 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.659
 that ursu with the right approach is wrong 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.080
 so difficult to counter now I have detailed 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.310
 tell you what we need to do 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.140
 It is worth noting that I usually beat 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.930
 can meet two buckets horse racing son 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.710
 the first is the forest and the second kerry bells 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.810
 on izine line 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.430
 if the first option is found only 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.890
 on forehead reality or pubs one and a half 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.500
 squid or 103 becoming victories in the second 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.590
 most popular and correct about 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.540
 he will speak 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.470
 minus ursa can also be attributed to the extreme 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.420
 predictability 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.619
 any person who guides dota at least 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.590
 at least four 100 hours 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.390
 knows the algorithm of actions of this hero with 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.040
 joy is 5 + percent of urse 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.009
 will try to farm as soon as possible 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.420
 all vladimir and go pick up the roshan 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.460
 often many people play all 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.150
 neglected even boot that makes them 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.100
 extremely vulnerable to gangs 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.470
 the first thing to understand is what what 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.470
 farther away are you roshana 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:01.850
 useless weaker you do it proceeding 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.570
 of this you must in every possible way do not let 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.030
 all farm 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.350
 and generally calmly stand on the line there 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.209
 whether they made a hero with a long-range attack 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.840
 then you have no particular problems with this 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:13.540
 will arise the second point of tactics will give 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.380
 they are all wards 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.300
 firstly because with them you can 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.760
 trace when ursa goes to roshana 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.530
 to catch him by surprise and there in 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.620
 second if you put wards in the forest not 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.060
 give him easy to farm there and you 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.150
 the appearance of the smooth course will be there 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.920
 often drop in as well if you 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.420
 saw how the course went to Rosha then 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.420
 Advice wait a bit and not 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.890
 break in kill him there immediately 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.140
 this is done so that the bursa was 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.690
 easier to kill because it will have time to rush 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.000
 at least a little rattle and in order to 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.040
 if roshe will have little health you 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.780
 yourself could pick it go to 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.459
 like you and will cause a 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:53.630
 enormous damage to the entire economy usievicha 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.069
 now move on directly to the hero 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.560
 which will be most effective against 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.700
 this character 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.950
 First of all, I would point out the hero with 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.200
 illusions such as lancer foot and chaos 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.329
 on an ide course to control is 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.000
 character fat killer and against all 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:10.390
 these illusions have nothing to fight him then 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.530
 on the contrary, they will rub off the issues 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.030
 followed by a hero who is 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.400
 the enemy for all the whole of the dealers 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.470
 omniknight and it really is worth it 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.140
 he pressed Ulta same mustache becomes 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.269
 give useless if you still consider 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.950
 what really tagirovich nobody hill omnica will 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:27.579
 not only hinder kill kill enemy 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:30.440
 Yes, and not bad nadamazhil 

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:33.079
 still would not want to leave without 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.980
 attention of such a hero as I think here 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:35.600
 and no need to explain 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.070
 wiped the hero sites with bags of big 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.970
 attack speeds and not the biggest 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.340
 health stock 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:43.310
 passive aksa along with dogma do them 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.870
 all with us always in which stands 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.440
 take against courses I can mark everything 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.720
 the same you 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.670
 and the voice you will help you survive 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.560
 unexpected attacks cowards a voice 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:55.370
 after you shield from him in the batch at least 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:57.650
 for a while this is all thanks for 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.269

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.100
