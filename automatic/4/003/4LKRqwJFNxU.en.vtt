00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:03.870
 hello how about friends how are we doing well here again we are doing 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.770
 the video tutorial and where you can explain you like setting the 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.019
 rotation 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:12.880
 and well, he told them that the images of the planes that I do a bit 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:16.720
 difficult send the holy friends is good because I hope that here we can 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:17.269
 watch 

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:21.439
 in a preview with him he wrote he's left a lot of room for the plan together 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:25.090
 but I was going to many I leave you with the video and we are in contact because 

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:28.089
 the octopus is the arm stadiums friends 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.330
 for the same reason we have not achieved it 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.820
 promotion of tutorial 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.820
 the idea of ​​how to finish adjusting the octopus 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.310
 let's do what 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.720
 yes good you can adjust for a dream that you have doubts 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.190
 with regard to potential authors 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.050
 the qualifiers 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.190
 there the fear because they know that 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:53.700
 sesame street 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.700
 but at this moment what the sr 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.010
 you can see that these texts 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.880
 those groups are here 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.590
 they hold 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.540
 Marco Corti commented 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.010
 with this low 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.270
 not because for example as well as vital somewhat opposed 2 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.620
 lipsky too 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.550
 so 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.760
 Ten at the time of these families 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.910
 14 points 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.490
 it is impossible to move neighborhoods 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.490
 sometimes that asks what to say 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.090
 the stockings is fine 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.110
 exact seat but we do not know well by ana 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.390
 how can you see this 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.390
 clear for nowhere 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.310
 good means 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.650
 How can the framework be that they have more awareness so that 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:47.840
 we pay home 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.050
 among more people 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:52.650
 for example here 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.110
 what beer stupidity 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.920
 and I'll have to be closer at home with stupor between these 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.760
 we will have to do 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.150
 is to run 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.630
 the framework for 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.149
 so that it can have exactly the 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.309
 the rotation of it 

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:11.749
 I came here 

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:12.949
 series 

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:14.929
 be here could not move 

00:02:14.929 --> 00:02:17.919
 persists lazy if you can move from here to home 

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:20.929
 I know there will be no problem 

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:23.889
 another one that we have to be very very aware of 

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:25.909
 sixth 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:27.799
 next to this exactly 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:29.739
 well chile 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.739
 I insist that the pensionazo this precise 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.639
 painter's palette 

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:37.849
 the appointment so they would not leave 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:40.799
 and these kids racing and this space 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:43.409
 do not create some kind of 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:45.879
 the problem 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:48.209
 we are not the worst 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.359
 at the time of going to the time that this can be 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:53.489
 yes that assumption 500 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.679
 the collection can be separated the works 

00:02:55.679 --> 00:02:58.619
 In any case, the frame does not fit 

00:02:58.619 --> 00:03:02.049
 you can do more below the palette I will show 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.989
 so he asked himself who came 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.329
 mexico 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:08.969
 from left 

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:11.969
 No type is feared 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:14.629
 the two judge extractors 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:17.709
 he would not have to change that much because 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:18.989
 an hour later 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.949
 we fit data 

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:25.040
 there would no longer be mobility ianonne mobility osama that can be moved 

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:28.039
 everything completely that they did not spend more as you can see 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:32.639
 they do not fit Basque 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:35.259
 everything is perfectly 

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:37.329
 perfectly sealed 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:41.329
 commercial sources and the case of frames requires ran can be run 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.749
 because this has 

00:03:46.749 --> 00:03:48.789
 at the time of lending they pressed 

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:51.869
 can not move persist loose and more things for short that is 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:55.569
 or in any case like those of the gentleman in the part below 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:04:00.259
 is in one of the tournaments the table hosts the receiver do for k 

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:03.759
 if marco approached her and grim 

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:05.369
 the leather palette 

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:06.689
 and I can 

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:10.260
 I want to make it fit perfectly it came to be believed that the sector effect 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.799
 they think 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:14.269
 and up or down directly to k 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:17.559
 we could have school effects 

00:04:17.559 --> 00:04:20.109
 that is the secret of the adjustment 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:22.749
 let's start with the framework 

00:04:22.749 --> 00:04:25.240
 other species have 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.090
 it was very beautiful quality 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.330
 it's not that it's perfectly fine 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.279
 liriano goals profile 

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:33.569
 my email 

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:35.610
 It's in 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:36.979
 there is the video 

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:39.979
 of youtube here you can go against so much any 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:41.689
 keep in touch
