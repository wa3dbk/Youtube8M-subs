00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.939 

I<00:00:27.240> think<00:00:27.930> it's<00:00:28.020> really<00:00:28.260> impressive<00:00:28.439> I<00:00:28.800> think

I think it's really impressive I think

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:29.900 
I think it's really impressive I think
we've<00:00:29.039> spent<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.340> last<00:00:29.369> two<00:00:29.610> and<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:29.760> half

pleased convenient since I can do

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.960 
pleased convenient since I can do
something<00:00:43.680> else<00:00:43.860> that<00:00:44.070> than<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.580> actual

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:44.970 
something else that than the actual

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.960 
something else that than the actual
driving<00:00:45.680> safe<00:00:46.680> since<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.220> system<00:00:47.430> will<00:00:47.820> take

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:47.970 
driving safe since the system will take

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.549 
driving safe since the system will take
care<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.390> driving<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:49.050> will<00:00:49.230> eliminate

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
care of the driving it will eliminate

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.820 
care of the driving it will eliminate
the<00:00:50.160> human<00:00:50.489> errors<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.239> then<00:00:51.960> fuel-efficient

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:52.830 
the human errors and then fuel-efficient

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.790 
the human errors and then fuel-efficient
since<00:00:53.550> we<00:00:53.970> use<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.330> minor<00:00:54.750> gap<00:00:55.140> size<00:00:55.470> between

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
since we use a minor gap size between

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.189 
since we use a minor gap size between
the<00:00:56.010> vehicles<00:00:56.579> we<00:00:56.790> will<00:00:56.970> reduce<00:00:57.360> air<00:00:57.660> drag<00:00:57.930> and

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
the vehicles we will reduce air drag and

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:28.200 
the vehicles we will reduce air drag and
thereby<00:00:58.589> fuel<00:00:58.860> consumption

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.030 

it's<00:01:29.210> quite<00:01:29.420> fun<00:01:29.690> to<00:01:29.900> see<00:01:30.110> here<00:01:30.350> the<00:01:30.590> passing

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
it's quite fun to see here the passing

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.040 
it's quite fun to see here the passing
vehicles<00:01:31.580> there<00:01:32.360> are<00:01:32.420> quite<00:01:32.600> surprised

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.050 
vehicles there are quite surprised

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.530 
vehicles there are quite surprised
seeing<00:01:33.950> me<00:01:34.250> not<00:01:34.520> driving<00:01:35.000> the<00:01:35.119> car<00:01:35.150> but

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
seeing me not driving the car but

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.460 
seeing me not driving the car but
reading<00:01:36.530> a<00:01:36.710> magazine<00:01:36.970> they<00:01:37.970> will<00:01:38.200> turn<00:01:39.200> back

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
reading a magazine they will turn back

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:53.010 
reading a magazine they will turn back
and<00:01:39.830> see<00:01:39.979> each<00:01:40.160> year<00:01:40.400> actually<00:01:40.640> not<00:01:41.360> a<00:01:41.390> driving

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.900 

I<00:01:54.020> think<00:01:54.649> it<00:01:54.800> gets<00:01:55.070> easier<00:01:55.759> as<00:01:55.880> time

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
I think it gets easier as time

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.550 
I think it gets easier as time
progresses<00:01:56.509> and<00:01:56.660> people<00:01:57.110> become<00:01:57.410> more

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
progresses and people become more

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.499 
progresses and people become more
familiar<00:01:57.740> with<00:01:58.009> the<00:01:58.160> technology<00:01:58.670> and<00:01:58.940> they

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
familiar with the technology and they

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:02.350 
familiar with the technology and they
accept<00:02:00.080> it<00:02:00.229> more<00:02:00.440> I<00:02:00.770> think<00:02:01.009> as<00:02:01.360> generations

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
accept it more I think as generations

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.850 
accept it more I think as generations
progressed<00:02:02.990> they<00:02:03.200> become<00:02:03.560> more<00:02:03.740> familiar

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
progressed they become more familiar

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.060 
progressed they become more familiar
with<00:02:04.100> it<00:02:04.280> and<00:02:04.399> more<00:02:04.660> accepting<00:02:05.660> of<00:02:05.750> it<00:02:05.869> my<00:02:06.410> son

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
with it and more accepting of it my son

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.070 
with it and more accepting of it my son
he's<00:02:07.340> asking<00:02:08.090> me<00:02:08.149> questions<00:02:08.539> about<00:02:08.780> this<00:02:08.899> he

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
he's asking me questions about this he

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:28.750 
he's asking me questions about this he
wants<00:02:09.289> to<00:02:09.410> see<00:02:09.560> it<00:02:09.679> on<00:02:09.769> the<00:02:09.890> roads<00:02:10.070> now

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.150 

today<00:02:29.760> we<00:02:29.940> had<00:02:30.090> slopes<00:02:30.480> we<00:02:30.989> had<00:02:31.200> winds<00:02:31.620> it<00:02:32.069> was

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
today we had slopes we had winds it was

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.300 
today we had slopes we had winds it was
quite<00:02:32.400> windy<00:02:32.640> a<00:02:33.000> lot<00:02:33.629> of<00:02:33.750> other<00:02:33.870> traffic<00:02:34.310> and

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
quite windy a lot of other traffic and

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.650 
quite windy a lot of other traffic and
it<00:02:35.550> was<00:02:35.670> great<00:02:35.879> to<00:02:36.030> see<00:02:36.060> that<00:02:36.390> the<00:02:36.480> system

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
it was great to see that the system

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.140 
it was great to see that the system
could<00:02:37.050> could<00:02:37.440> handle<00:02:37.739> it<00:02:37.860> so<00:02:38.069> very<00:02:38.310> very<00:02:38.459> very

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
could could handle it so very very very

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.200 
could could handle it so very very very
positive<00:02:39.660> experience
