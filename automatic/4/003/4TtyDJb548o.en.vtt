00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.949
 tournament france england ireland 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.080
 yes, it's going to be a very, very good match 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.269
 between these pros nations and horses of 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.800
 great quality we will see if you 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.059
 have plebiscite foreigners I believe 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.430
 that's the case in your selection 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.010
 then you listen to the 4th rich and fly the 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.739
 7 a time for all 8th candaele art 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.290
 3 here of the new saying the Ballina town 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.420
 13 santos back the nine the castle and the 6 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.579
 Val to close ok regarding your favorite 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.140
 the hurricane case fly we know it is 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.219
 has become auteuil second prize alain du 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.350
 breil it was in 2008 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.120
 not seen since but we announce as the 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.829
 best mullin I think that's the 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.899
 best mule hince compared to his 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.210
 performances he's he's won group 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.690
 many times in England and 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.760
 Ireland 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.650
 it is also the choice of ruby ​​walsh 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.270
 so the last time he had chosen 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.920
 Worth doing b saw what it gave 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.900
 this body and this time he took 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.549
 hurricane fly so I made him 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.650
 trust even if it's a horse that 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.049
 is still more confirmed about 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.960
 speed course 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:22.229
 but hey he is 11 years old and of the trade 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.780
 so the feat of going to win is 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.000
 really shocked like ryu chun do 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.070
 trust wanted to oppose the walls is a 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.439
 time for any third of the renaud of the 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.509
 live in 2013 after winning what 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.560
 the price of houses-laffitte we go the 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.329
 keep it's our reference run 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.759
 you will see circulating a time for 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.409
 everything he is against horse riding 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.180
 disappointment for me I love this horse there 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.680
 we will notice we would see him a little 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.090
 little further a circle is also 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.500
 this is donnio they were going to classify themselves 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.210
 7th you have it in your selection 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.130
 lower a time for everything we can say 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.020
 what do we mean when he was 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.970
 trained by françois nicolle this 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.219
 time there is really a knight and 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.969
 that I liked a lot too 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:58.409
 for me it is a horse of great 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.960
 quality by the way he hit the eye 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.200
 of the 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.400
 and English so here is not 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.229
 deceived it is a horse of great 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.930
 quality his entourage has obviously 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:10.270
 aim for this event 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.920
 our horses unfortunately not 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.480
 maybe not a superb quality if we 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.340
 do not have gmx we do not have mandali on 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:18.580
 does not have any whitewash of this 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.350
 caliber so that's for me that's the one 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.810
 opposition hurricane fly enough 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.250
 logically the number 8 zarkandar the oci 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.110
 this beautiful third opposition of this 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.280
 group 1 last year especially 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.500
 winner of the grand prize autumn 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.450
 excuse of the little it stays on 3 excessive 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.890
 at group level a further sleeve must 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.150
 be wary when you have to be wary 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.530
 because he knows about auteuil which he has 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.560
 he has this advantage there 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.819
 and then hey it's a horse that made 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.980
 his evidence also other innings at this 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:43.940
 level at group level i and it does not take 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.430
 forget that it's the little brother of 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.930
 zarkava so on the flat is a 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.520
 little class a little kidney stroke that 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.340
 can make the difference 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.700
 ok you spoke French at one level 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.110
 lesser 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.790
 I would be suspicious of the number anyway 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.200
 3 here is deniau because it's a horse 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.580
 who does not know his limits 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.110
 undefeated on the brooms 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.310
 of auteuil this year it comes from 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.989
 win in the price leon rambaud a 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.480
 group 2 attention there are ambitions 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:08.330
 like his shares in ten days and 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:11.269
 no if it's true he has who he has 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.380
 won the reference race so a 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:14.690
 races reference price leon rambaud 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:16.340
 and it's really small horse that 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:17.840
 I love yes but just play and 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.310
 we listen guide we will do it 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.480
 after I wanted to do before the island of 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.380
 noah but will not arrive was at his 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.910
 meeting he will talk to us about 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.910
 ambitions this number 3 is deniau on 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.739
 will not listen to it last 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:36.470
 I stayed well to welcome a small 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:39.260
 little do I do the same category of the 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.610
 category but even worse elsewhere you 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.140
 have it said but finally last you 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:47.299
 did you say that the goal 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:48.920
 before complete then I want to deceive and 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:50.480
 not that they tell bullshit but 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.570
 there with my it's true that there is one 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.160
 we will be fine 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:57.459
 I let flow so that all the fires 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.459
 are green 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:03.019
 good then understood a ca this fetish to 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.209
 very little in the clan of guides 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:06.500
 audio 1300 elected members cross pretty 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:07.730
 logical but it's pretty logical said 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.560
 what he really realized a beautiful 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.780
 performance last time we wanted 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.920
 see it a little bit these levels and well 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.690
 we saw that I'm a horse 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.540
 I love it but 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.430
 j-pr who I think the English are 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.769
 more mature and more experienced makes 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.630
 now 1 a victory on his part 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.310
 it's really very similar what 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.590
 that it happens we will push it in 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.120
 fifth position the 10 whales agour 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.440
 who come to remember our good 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.630
 remember more well we'll say even from 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.800
 surprise by winning the barca on 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.930
 can wait for confirmation 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.670
 yes on what he did I do not see 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.870
 why he would not repeat me 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.980
 I was a bit surprised because for 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.110
 me it's more a horse of this type 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.640
 is that at their age very good horse 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.970
 this guy there because he has references 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:48.650
 really very very good in england 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.540
 here he is a little surprised but hey 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.700
 think he'll repeat for early for a 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:54.080
 place we can not dismiss it 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.340
 before concluding small news 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.960
 additional ground we will start 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.480
 with laurent viel who will tell us about 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:03.500
 challenges of anjou number one it was a 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:06.890
 regret we listen immediately to the 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:08.930
 barcasse and it was a preparation the 

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:11.150
 performance is that he has in my opinion 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:13.400
 was a bit of consultants is 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:16.250
 but bertrand lestrade with the orders 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:19.190
 already do not be hard on him but 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:20.990
 for sure the big rose is more of a 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:22.010
 goal that seeing her that one could have 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.930
 make the finish in the bar because we 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.940
 would not be embarrassed but the goal was to 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:27.890
 well run and choice there as they say 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.060
 to raise the odds to finish and he has 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:31.460
 finished in a beautiful action it is cooked 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:34.310
 thiel but I think the 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:37.580
 lengthening the distance to Sunday 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:39.470
 It's going to be much better here 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.460
 will understand that's why it's the 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:41.630
 trust now it's true that at 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.740
 paper for the win it's complicated 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:43.310
 now why not a place with 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.810
 my journey 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:46.310
 yes of course in the first five on 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:47.930
 may consider only considered 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:50.540
 now to have fun 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:51.680
 we will listen louise harker burry same 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:53.060
 so we were meeting him 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.200
 she's going to talk to us about hand rowers the 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.610
 last time we had the exclusive info 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:58.010
 he had won the quinté at 25 against 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:00.050
 1 just for that one will hear it 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:03.500
 very fast but watch out if it rains 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:05.970
 will not get married rowers we listen to them 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:09.690
 yeah that was great that day he had to 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:10.980
 feel his distance the weight and shins there 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:13.080
 but you for him but it's true that 

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:15.450
 This is a horse that I still had it 

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.460
 for him he is ten years old he has this is 

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:18.980
 now or never a little I think 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:22.110
 that he has the right to be not too far 

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:24.210
 because that says there are very very good 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:26.190
 I'm crazy in there with a flower in 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:29.400
 even kanda essars that's better for 

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:31.020
 the French is not obvious here 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.820
 just had a tip to watch you the 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:35.190
 heaven so really it's raining it's raining it 

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:36.990
 rain it is slipped on his ticket if the 

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:38.280
 ground stays dry or just under it is going 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:40.170
 to be really very complicated 

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:41.700
 stephanie thank you for all thoroughly we will 

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:44.730
 to leave with a little nugget to 

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:47.010
 win - win i hope the 512 heroes 

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:48.240
 fikara is a horse that could have 

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:49.470
 cover the major types of bets
