00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:44.010 
and it also makes you a more coiled and
compressed<00:01:42.070> spring<00:01:42.340> so<00:01:43.150> the<00:01:43.270> concept<00:01:43.720> is<00:01:43.840> as

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
compressed spring so the concept is as

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.899 
compressed spring so the concept is as
soon<00:01:44.170> as<00:01:44.320> you<00:01:44.470> close<00:01:44.740> distance<00:01:45.549> with<00:01:45.670> the<00:01:45.790> guy

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909 
soon as you close distance with the guy

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:48.300 
soon as you close distance with the guy
say<00:01:46.420> you<00:01:46.450> follow<00:01:46.840> in<00:01:47.049> his<00:01:47.200> job<00:01:47.409> he<00:01:47.799> jobs<00:01:48.100> have

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
say you follow in his job he jobs have

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.899 
say you follow in his job he jobs have
you<00:01:48.400> following<00:01:48.790> it<00:01:49.000> so<00:01:49.720> you<00:01:49.780> quickly<00:01:50.140> slip

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
you following it so you quickly slip

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.490 
you following it so you quickly slip
bob-and-weave<00:01:51.909> and<00:01:52.420> now<00:01:52.509> you<00:01:52.570> stay<00:01:52.960> low<00:01:53.229> where

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
bob-and-weave and now you stay low where

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.149 
bob-and-weave and now you stay low where
you<00:01:53.530> work

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
you work

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:56.370 
you work
