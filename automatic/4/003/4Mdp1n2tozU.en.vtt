00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.039 
although I did do early fashion dolls
little<00:03:59.670> girl<00:03:59.850> dolls<00:04:00.090> were<00:04:00.299> commercially

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
little girl dolls were commercially

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:03.229 
little girl dolls were commercially
easier<00:04:01.470> for<00:04:01.709> us<00:04:01.799> to<00:04:01.950> produce<00:04:02.160> and<00:04:02.549> to<00:04:02.640> make<00:04:02.880> so

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
easier for us to produce and to make so

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.840 
easier for us to produce and to make so
I<00:04:03.510> did<00:04:03.870> that<00:04:04.019> first<00:04:04.230> and<00:04:04.650> when<00:04:05.220> I<00:04:05.250> went<00:04:05.580> to<00:04:05.640> do

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
I did that first and when I went to do

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:10.300 
I did that first and when I went to do
Tyler<00:04:06.269> Wentworth<00:04:06.720> I<00:04:07.019> wanted<00:04:07.739> to<00:04:08.010> do<00:04:08.790> something

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
Tyler Wentworth I wanted to do something

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.430 
Tyler Wentworth I wanted to do something
certainly<00:04:11.310> I<00:04:11.579> mean<00:04:11.850> I<00:04:12.360> wouldn't<00:04:13.019> really<00:04:13.200> say

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
certainly I mean I wouldn't really say

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.960 
certainly I mean I wouldn't really say
it<00:04:13.500> was<00:04:13.620> inspired<00:04:14.160> but<00:04:14.370> there<00:04:14.489> was<00:04:14.610> definitely

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
it was inspired but there was definitely

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.170 
it was inspired but there was definitely
this<00:04:15.090> feel<00:04:15.630> of<00:04:15.959> Barbie<00:04:16.769> and<00:04:16.919> I<00:04:16.979> wanted<00:04:17.250> to<00:04:17.310> not

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
this feel of Barbie and I wanted to not

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.510 
this feel of Barbie and I wanted to not
duplicate<00:04:18.750> Barbie<00:04:19.080> but<00:04:19.200> I<00:04:19.260> wanted<00:04:19.560> to<00:04:19.620> to<00:04:20.310> take

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:20.520 
duplicate Barbie but I wanted to to take

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.099 
duplicate Barbie but I wanted to to take
some<00:04:20.729> of<00:04:20.820> the<00:04:20.910> elements<00:04:21.239> that<00:04:21.479> I<00:04:21.599> there<00:04:21.989> were

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
some of the elements that I there were

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:22.450 
some of the elements that I there were
so

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
so

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.610 
so
that<00:04:22.910> so<00:04:23.120> impressed<00:04:23.569> me<00:04:23.870> in<00:04:24.110> those<00:04:24.289> early

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:34.950 
sort of evolution in a collector and I

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:37.730 
sort of evolution in a collector and I
