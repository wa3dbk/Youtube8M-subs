00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:10.510 
if they're as equal as possible so once

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:11.640 
if they're as equal as possible so once
you<00:01:10.570> get<00:01:10.660> them<00:01:10.840> out<00:01:10.960> here's<00:01:11.290> where<00:01:11.410> it<00:01:11.500> gets

you get them out here's where it gets

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.800 
you get them out here's where it gets
maybe<00:01:12.010> a<00:01:12.130> little<00:01:12.430> bit<00:01:12.700> complicated<00:01:13.060> you're

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
maybe a little bit complicated you're

maybe a little bit complicated you're
going<00:01:13.990> to<00:01:14.050> take<00:01:14.200> your<00:01:14.350> scissors<00:01:14.560> you're<00:01:14.979> going

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
to take one of them and you're basically

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.710 
to take one of them and you're basically
you're<00:01:18.280> not<00:01:18.340> going<00:01:18.640> to<00:01:18.700> cut<00:01:18.940> all<00:01:19.180> the<00:01:19.420> way<00:01:19.540> down

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720

you're not going to cut all the way down
just<00:01:20.050> start<00:01:20.350> cutting<00:01:20.800> down<00:01:21.690> each<00:01:22.690> four<00:01:23.410> sides

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.150 

and<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:31.030> do<00:01:31.180> not<00:01:31.360> want<00:01:31.780> to<00:01:31.899> cut<00:01:32.110> all<00:01:32.410> the<00:01:33.040> way

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:33.160 
and you do not want to cut all the way

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.580 
and you do not want to cut all the way
down<00:01:33.479> you<00:01:34.479> just<00:01:34.690> want<00:01:34.899> to<00:01:34.960> kind<00:01:35.200> of<00:01:35.350> have<00:01:35.470> it

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
down you just want to kind of have it

down you just want to kind of have it
like<00:01:35.800> that<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:37.240> then<00:01:37.420> you're<00:01:37.570> going<00:01:37.690> to<00:01:37.750> cut

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
like that and then you're going to cut

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:46.590 
like that and then you're going to cut
kind<00:01:39.759> of<00:01:39.910> slots<00:01:41.160> on<00:01:42.160> each<00:01:42.460> one<00:01:42.759> and<00:01:45.600> you're

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
kind of slots on each one and you're

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.109 
kind of slots on each one and you're
going<00:01:46.720> to<00:01:46.750> create<00:01:47.020> it<00:01:47.080> like<00:01:47.110> slots<00:01:47.770> on<00:01:48.130> each

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
going to create it like slots on each

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:52.590 
going to create it like slots on each
four<00:01:49.630> sides<00:01:50.080> sides<00:01:51.040> and<00:01:51.460> try<00:01:51.940> to<00:01:52.060> make<00:01:52.240> them<00:01:52.390> as

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
four sides sides and try to make them as

00:01:52.600 --> 00:02:05.120 
four sides sides and try to make them as
even<00:01:53.290> as<00:01:53.500> possible

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.070 

and<00:02:05.610> cut<00:02:06.030> it<00:02:06.150> out<00:02:06.240> so<00:02:06.510> then<00:02:06.659> it<00:02:06.780> looks<00:02:06.990> like

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
and cut it out so then it looks like

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.370 
and cut it out so then it looks like
that<00:02:07.439> so<00:02:07.770> then<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:08.009> kind<00:02:08.160> of<00:02:08.250> have<00:02:08.479> it<00:02:09.479> like

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
that so then you kind of have it like

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.990 
that so then you kind of have it like
the<00:02:10.530> hem<00:02:10.709> not<00:02:10.920> quite<00:02:11.160> sure<00:02:11.190> what<00:02:11.520> else<00:02:11.670> to<00:02:11.850> say

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
the hem not quite sure what else to say

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.520 
the hem not quite sure what else to say
but<00:02:12.209> it<00:02:12.990> should<00:02:13.290> look<00:02:13.530> something<00:02:13.910> like<00:02:14.910> that

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
but it should look something like that

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.990 
but it should look something like that
equal<00:02:16.530> now<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:16.980> other<00:02:17.220> TV<00:02:17.520> you're<00:02:17.760> going<00:02:17.790> to

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
equal now the other TV you're going to

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.520 
equal now the other TV you're going to
cut<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.300> same<00:02:18.510> way<00:02:18.540> not<00:02:18.989> the<00:02:19.110> same<00:02:19.290> way<00:02:19.410> as

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
cut the same way not the same way as

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.860 
cut the same way not the same way as
that<00:02:19.640> but<00:02:20.640> you're<00:02:21.030> going<00:02:21.209> to<00:02:21.330> cut<00:02:21.600> on<00:02:21.840> one<00:02:22.380> side

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
that but you're going to cut on one side

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.860 
that but you're going to cut on one side
right<00:02:24.870> down<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.260> center<00:02:26.420> and<00:02:27.420> you're<00:02:27.750> going

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
right down the center and you're going

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.860 
right down the center and you're going
to<00:02:27.900> cut<00:02:28.170> right<00:02:28.620> to<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:29.010> middle<00:02:29.660> and<00:02:30.660> then

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
to cut right to the middle and then

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.520 
to cut right to the middle and then
you're<00:02:31.020> going<00:02:31.170> to<00:02:31.230> create<00:02:33.230> obviously<00:02:34.230> like

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
you're going to create obviously like

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.210 
you're going to create obviously like
the<00:02:35.310> gap<00:02:35.520> like<00:02:36.030> that<00:02:36.830> and<00:02:37.830> then<00:02:37.980> you're<00:02:38.100> going

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
the gap like that and then you're going

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.660 
the gap like that and then you're going
to<00:02:38.310> create<00:02:38.550> like<00:02:38.819> a<00:02:39.000> little<00:02:39.030> notch<00:02:39.630> in<00:02:40.670> the

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
to create like a little notch in the

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:48.140 
to create like a little notch in the
middle<00:02:44.209> it's<00:02:45.209> better<00:02:45.450> to<00:02:45.690> just<00:02:45.930> show<00:02:46.230> you<00:02:47.150> like

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
middle it's better to just show you like

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.229 
middle it's better to just show you like
that<00:02:48.540> because<00:02:49.319> that's<00:02:49.530> going<00:02:49.650> to<00:02:49.830> fit<00:02:50.100> through

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:50.239 
that because that's going to fit through

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:52.520 
that because that's going to fit through
and<00:02:51.239> you're<00:02:51.360> going<00:02:51.480> to<00:02:51.510> want<00:02:51.780> it<00:02:51.930> as<00:02:52.080> wide<00:02:52.500> as

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
and you're going to want it as wide as

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:53.809 
and you're going to want it as wide as
it<00:02:53.010> as<00:02:53.160> it<00:02:53.430> is

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
it as it is

00:02:53.819 --> 00:03:00.080 
it as it is
from<00:02:54.630> here<00:02:55.200> to<00:02:55.440> here<00:02:55.860> so<00:02:57.049> about<00:02:58.049> there<00:02:58.470> is<00:02:59.090> good

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
from here to here so about there is good

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.940 
from here to here so about there is good
and<00:03:00.360> just<00:03:00.450> like<00:03:01.230> that<00:03:01.410> and<00:03:01.620> you're<00:03:01.709> going<00:03:01.860> to

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
and just like that and you're going to

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.949 
and just like that and you're going to
cut<00:03:02.160> the<00:03:02.340> other<00:03:02.549> one<00:03:02.989> the<00:03:03.989> same<00:03:04.019> way<00:03:05.780> so<00:03:06.780> it's

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
cut the other one the same way so it's

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.949 
cut the other one the same way so it's
straight<00:03:07.260> down<00:03:07.410> the<00:03:08.120> straight<00:03:09.120> down<00:03:09.329> right<00:03:09.810> to

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
straight down the straight down right to

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:16.009 
straight down the straight down right to
the<00:03:10.079> middle<00:03:14.239> you're<00:03:15.239> going<00:03:15.390> to<00:03:15.450> create<00:03:15.690> your

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
the middle you're going to create your

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:24.560 
the middle you're going to create your
little<00:03:17.480> thing<00:03:18.480> in<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:19.440> middle<00:03:19.500> of<00:03:20.010> it<00:03:23.359> so<00:03:24.359> now

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
little thing in the middle of it so now

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.060 
little thing in the middle of it so now
you<00:03:24.630> should<00:03:24.780> have<00:03:24.930> three<00:03:25.260> pieces<00:03:25.560> looking

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
you should have three pieces looking

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:28.970 
you should have three pieces looking
like<00:03:26.220> this<00:03:26.370> -<00:03:26.940> that<00:03:26.970> looks<00:03:27.359> like<00:03:27.810> that<00:03:28.560> and<00:03:28.829> one

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
like this - that looks like that and one

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.440 
like this - that looks like that and one
that<00:03:29.100> looks<00:03:29.160> like<00:03:29.459> that<00:03:29.640> I<00:03:29.940> hope<00:03:30.120> that<00:03:30.209> wasn't

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
that looks like that I hope that wasn't

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:31.310 
that looks like that I hope that wasn't
too<00:03:30.600> complicated

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
too complicated

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.420 
too complicated
now<00:03:31.890> take<00:03:32.130> this<00:03:32.430> four<00:03:33.620> piece<00:03:34.620> or<00:03:34.980> this<00:03:35.250> one

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
now take this four piece or this one

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.970 
now take this four piece or this one
whatever<00:03:35.940> you<00:03:36.030> call<00:03:36.180> it<00:03:36.209> and<00:03:37.079> you're<00:03:37.799> going<00:03:37.890> to

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
whatever you call it and you're going to

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.170 
whatever you call it and you're going to
fold<00:03:38.250> it<00:03:38.459> in<00:03:38.670> half<00:03:39.890> like<00:03:40.890> so<00:03:41.030> then<00:03:42.030> you're

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
fold it in half like so then you're

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.380 
fold it in half like so then you're
going<00:03:42.299> to<00:03:42.359> separate<00:03:42.900> the<00:03:43.739> sides<00:03:44.100> and<00:03:45.060> you're

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
going to separate the sides and you're

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.630 
going to separate the sides and you're
going<00:03:45.540> to<00:03:45.570> stick<00:03:45.989> this<00:03:46.200> one<00:03:47.540> right

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
going to stick this one right

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.820 
going to stick this one right
in<00:03:50.390> there<00:03:50.750> and<00:03:51.020> you're<00:03:51.230> going<00:03:51.350> to<00:03:51.380> push<00:03:51.620> this

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
in there and you're going to push this

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:57.220 
in there and you're going to push this
all<00:03:52.790> the<00:03:52.850> way<00:03:53.150> down<00:03:53.420> to<00:03:53.750> the<00:03:53.990> middle<00:03:56.230> and

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
all the way down to the middle and

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.140 
all the way down to the middle and
you're<00:03:57.440> going<00:03:57.470> to<00:03:57.620> open<00:03:58.190> up<00:03:58.750> these<00:03:59.750> sides<00:04:00.170> and

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
you're going to open up these sides and

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.680 
you're going to open up these sides and
you're<00:04:02.150> going<00:04:02.360> to<00:04:02.450> fold<00:04:02.720> them<00:04:02.990> up<00:04:04.210> to<00:04:05.210> line<00:04:05.450> up

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
you're going to fold them up to line up

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:13.120 
you're going to fold them up to line up
with<00:04:06.560> the<00:04:07.030> gap<00:04:08.030> on<00:04:09.880> the<00:04:10.880> big<00:04:11.090> piece<00:04:12.100> like<00:04:13.100> that

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
with the gap on the big piece like that

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.330 
with the gap on the big piece like that
and<00:04:13.370> then<00:04:13.880> you're<00:04:14.000> going<00:04:14.120> to<00:04:14.240> slide<00:04:15.340> this

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
and then you're going to slide this

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:22.060 
and then you're going to slide this
piece<00:04:16.760> down<00:04:18.970> all<00:04:19.970> the<00:04:20.480> way<00:04:20.660> once<00:04:21.440> you<00:04:21.650> can<00:04:21.890> get

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
piece down all the way once you can get

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:34.360 
piece down all the way once you can get
it<00:04:22.160> in<00:04:22.280> there<00:04:31.810> and<00:04:32.810> now<00:04:33.680> once<00:04:33.980> you<00:04:34.130> have<00:04:34.160> that

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:34.370 
it in there and now once you have that

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.690 
it in there and now once you have that
you<00:04:34.790> can<00:04:34.970> just<00:04:35.230> fold<00:04:36.790> this<00:04:37.790> four<00:04:38.240> corner<00:04:38.750> piece

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
you can just fold this four corner piece

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:45.640 
you can just fold this four corner piece
fold<00:04:40.700> each<00:04:40.970> of<00:04:41.150> the<00:04:41.270> four<00:04:41.570> corners<00:04:41.840> up<00:04:44.650> and

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
fold each of the four corners up and

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:50.050 
fold each of the four corners up and
that<00:04:46.100> will<00:04:46.310> create<00:04:46.580> the<00:04:47.150> cool<00:04:47.480> shape<00:04:48.910> you<00:04:49.910> can

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
that will create the cool shape you can

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.860 
that will create the cool shape you can
just<00:04:50.270> neaten<00:04:50.600> it<00:04:50.780> out<00:04:51.880> and<00:04:52.880> then<00:04:53.150> you<00:04:53.360> are<00:04:53.600> done

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
just neaten it out and then you are done

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.050 
just neaten it out and then you are done
besides<00:04:54.260> this<00:04:54.710> was<00:04:54.860> a<00:04:54.890> little<00:04:55.190> confusing

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
besides this was a little confusing

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.060 
besides this was a little confusing
I'm<00:04:56.150> just<00:04:56.780> give<00:04:56.960> it<00:04:57.080> a<00:04:57.110> go<00:04:57.200> you<00:04:57.229> may<00:04:57.650> be<00:04:57.710> able<00:04:57.919> to

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.110 
may take a couple times but you'll

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.469 
may take a couple times but you'll
eventually<00:05:00.410> get<00:05:01.340> it<00:05:01.490> it<00:05:01.610> took<00:05:01.729> me<00:05:01.940> like<00:05:02.090> two

00:05:02.469 --> 00:05:02.479

eventually get it it took me like two
times<00:05:02.750> it<00:05:03.710> was<00:05:03.830> a<00:05:03.860> little<00:05:04.220> bit<00:05:04.340> confusing<00:05:05.120> once

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 
times it was a little bit confusing once

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.120 
times it was a little bit confusing once
you<00:05:05.750> know<00:05:05.900> how<00:05:06.080> it's<00:05:06.320> really<00:05:06.500> easy<00:05:06.830> and<00:05:07.040> you

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130
