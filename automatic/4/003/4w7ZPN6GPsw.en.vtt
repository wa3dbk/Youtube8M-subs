00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
decorative and you can use it as a

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.670

centerpiece<00:00:41.820> maybe<00:00:42.329> for<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.660> fruit<00:00:43.230> bowl<00:00:43.410> but

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
centerpiece maybe for a fruit bowl but

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.900 
centerpiece maybe for a fruit bowl but
we<00:00:43.800> really<00:00:44.070> don't<00:00:44.160> need<00:00:44.309> it<00:00:44.460> for<00:00:44.579> this<00:00:44.670> purpose

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
we really don't need it for this purpose

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.819 
we really don't need it for this purpose
so<00:00:45.180> let's<00:00:45.510> just<00:00:45.719> set<00:00:45.870> that<00:00:45.899> move<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:46.530> aside

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
so let's just set that move that aside

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.880 
so let's just set that move that aside
now<00:00:47.820> I'm<00:00:48.420> going<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.600> cut<00:00:48.719> this<00:00:48.870> again<00:00:49.289> in<00:00:49.559> half

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
now I'm going to cut this again in half

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.189 
now I'm going to cut this again in half
crosswise<00:00:50.250> so<00:00:50.969> let's<00:00:51.510> just<00:00:51.719> take<00:00:51.930> that<00:00:52.140> and

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
crosswise so let's just take that and

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.790 
crosswise so let's just take that and
cut<00:00:52.980> it<00:00:53.100> straight<00:00:53.969> down<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.390> middle<00:00:54.559> move<00:00:55.559> one

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
cut it straight down the middle move one

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.130 
cut it straight down the middle move one
side<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.820> side<00:00:57.090> once<00:00:57.600> piece<00:00:57.989> of

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140

this<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.649> side<00:00:58.859> take<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.820> other<00:00:59.850> piece

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
this to the side take the other piece

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.330 
this to the side take the other piece
and<00:01:00.480> again<00:01:00.989> with<00:01:01.140> your<00:01:01.230> sharp<00:01:01.500> knife<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:02.309> can

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
and again with your sharp knife you can

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.910 
and again with your sharp knife you can
see<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.699> eyes<00:01:02.850> very<00:01:03.750> easily<00:01:04.049> in<00:01:04.470> this<00:01:04.680> all

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
see the eyes very easily in this all

curve of the fruit all the way down and
through<00:01:16.189> much<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.430> way<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:17.610> would<00:01:17.939> do<00:01:18.150> a

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
through much the way you would do a

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.910

to<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.619> side<00:01:43.740> so<00:01:44.130> it's<00:01:44.310> not<00:01:44.579> in<00:01:44.790> your<00:01:44.880> way<00:01:45.210> and

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
to the side so it's not in your way and

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.819 
to the side so it's not in your way and
now<00:01:47.670> we're<00:01:47.909> cutting<00:01:48.270> this<00:01:48.299> half<00:01:48.960> into

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
now we're cutting this half into

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.160 
now we're cutting this half into
quarters<00:01:50.310> for<00:01:50.729> Chuck<00:01:50.970> so<00:01:51.240> I'm<00:01:51.810> going<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.020> cut

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
quarters for Chuck so I'm going to cut

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.090 
quarters for Chuck so I'm going to cut
that<00:01:52.290> into<00:01:52.470> half<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.130> then<00:01:54.200> again<00:01:55.200> into

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
that into half and then again into

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.940 
that into half and then again into
another<00:01:56.340> half<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:57.140> then<00:01:58.140> you<00:01:58.590> can<00:01:58.770> pretty

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
another half and then you can pretty

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.850 
another half and then you can pretty
easily<00:01:59.040> see<00:01:59.880> the<00:01:59.909> core<00:02:00.540> running<00:02:01.500> through<00:02:01.740> the

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
easily see the core running through the

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.100 
easily see the core running through the
center<00:02:02.040> over<00:02:02.520> there<00:02:02.670> so<00:02:03.000> it's<00:02:03.659> really<00:02:03.840> easy

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
center over there so it's really easy

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.810 
center over there so it's really easy
just<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.500> go<00:02:04.530> like<00:02:04.649> this<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.250> get<00:02:05.490> rid<00:02:05.640> of<00:02:05.670> the

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
just to go like this and get rid of the

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.089 
just to go like this and get rid of the
core<00:02:06.090> so<00:02:06.750> now<00:02:06.960> we've<00:02:07.439> got<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.770> check<00:02:07.950> the

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
core so now we've got the check the

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.740 
core so now we've got the check the
pineapple<00:02:08.640> and<00:02:08.849> you<00:02:09.090> can<00:02:09.239> cut<00:02:09.390> it<00:02:09.420> into<00:02:09.629> pieces

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
pineapple and you can cut it into pieces

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.770 
pineapple and you can cut it into pieces
as<00:02:10.319> large<00:02:11.069> or<00:02:11.430> as<00:02:11.790> small<00:02:11.819> as<00:02:12.360> you<00:02:12.510> need<00:02:12.750> them

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
as large or as small as you need them

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.850 
as large or as small as you need them
for<00:02:12.989> whatever

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
for whatever

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.610 
for whatever
purpose<00:02:14.130> all<00:02:15.000> right<00:02:15.240> now<00:02:15.450> let's<00:02:15.720> take<00:02:15.930> in<00:02:16.200> or

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
purpose all right now let's take in or

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.850 
purpose all right now let's take in or
bring<00:02:16.800> in<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.040> other<00:02:17.190> side<00:02:18.120> of<00:02:18.150> this<00:02:18.510> and<00:02:18.860> do

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
bring in the other side of this and do

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.330 
bring in the other side of this and do
some<00:02:20.070> slices<00:02:20.460> so<00:02:20.940> again<00:02:21.630> I<00:02:22.110> like<00:02:23.070> to<00:02:23.160> put<00:02:23.280> the

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
some slices so again I like to put the

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.520 
some slices so again I like to put the
bigger<00:02:23.520> side<00:02:23.790> down<00:02:24.060> first<00:02:24.120> let's<00:02:25.080> do<00:02:25.230> the<00:02:25.350> same

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
bigger side down first let's do the same

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.180 
bigger side down first let's do the same
thing<00:02:25.770> all<00:02:25.980> around<00:02:27.080> I<00:02:28.080> know<00:02:28.710> you're<00:02:29.130> thinking

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
thing all around I know you're thinking

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.460

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
boy I don't want to waste too much of

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.160 
boy I don't want to waste too much of
this<00:02:31.800> and<00:02:32.220> I<00:02:32.430> would<00:02:32.910> totally<00:02:33.060> agree<00:02:33.360> but<00:02:33.660> you

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
this and I would totally agree but you

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.140

really do need to cut off those little
brown<00:02:37.340> bits<00:02:38.340> or<00:02:38.880> eyes<00:02:39.300> along<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:40.020> side<00:02:40.230> so

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
brown bits or eyes along the side so

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.350 
brown bits or eyes along the side so
you're<00:02:41.490> going<00:02:41.700> to<00:02:41.760> have<00:02:41.820> a<00:02:41.940> little<00:02:42.150> bit<00:02:42.270> of

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
you're going to have a little bit of

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.970 
you're going to have a little bit of
waste<00:02:42.630> here<00:02:42.810> no<00:02:42.959> matter<00:02:43.080> how<00:02:43.350> you<00:02:43.410> look<00:02:43.530> at<00:02:43.860> it

waste here no matter how you look at it

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.060 
waste here no matter how you look at it
so<00:02:44.850> in<00:02:45.120> this<00:02:45.300> case<00:02:45.570> I'm<00:02:45.930> going<00:02:45.990> to<00:02:46.380> just<00:02:46.860> cut

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
so in this case I'm going to just cut

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.580 
so in this case I'm going to just cut
through<00:02:47.670> the<00:02:48.060> cut<00:02:48.600> through<00:02:48.810> of<00:02:49.140> the<00:02:49.350> pineapple

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
through the cut through of the pineapple

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.150 
through the cut through of the pineapple
once<00:02:50.190> not<00:02:50.640> into<00:02:51.320> into<00:02:52.320> quarters<00:02:52.680> with<00:02:52.830> just<00:02:53.010> in

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
once not into into quarters with just in

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.680 
once not into into quarters with just in
two<00:02:53.250> halves<00:02:53.489> and<00:02:53.670> then<00:02:53.760> lay<00:02:54.060> it<00:02:54.180> down<00:02:54.360> like

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
two halves and then lay it down like

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.270 
two halves and then lay it down like
that<00:02:54.930> and<00:02:55.200> then<00:02:55.860> cut<00:02:56.160> that<00:02:56.430> into<00:02:57.410> slices<00:02:58.410> why

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
that and then cut that into slices why

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.830 
that and then cut that into slices why
would<00:02:59.459> I<00:02:59.489> want<00:02:59.730> to<00:02:59.820> do<00:02:59.970> this<00:03:00.180> and<00:03:00.450> leave<00:03:00.630> the

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
would I want to do this and leave the

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.600 
would I want to do this and leave the
chorion<00:03:01.320> because<00:03:02.010> I'm<00:03:02.190> going<00:03:02.370> to<00:03:02.459> be<00:03:02.520> using

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
chorion because I'm going to be using

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.090 
chorion because I'm going to be using
this<00:03:02.940> for<00:03:03.180> grilling<00:03:03.540> perhaps<00:03:03.870> tonight<00:03:04.260> and<00:03:04.590> if

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
this for grilling perhaps tonight and if

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.520 
this for grilling perhaps tonight and if
you<00:03:05.520> leave<00:03:05.760> the<00:03:05.910> core<00:03:06.150> in<00:03:06.390> it<00:03:06.660> just<00:03:07.290> really

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
you leave the core in it just really

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.380 
you leave the core in it just really
helps<00:03:07.709> the<00:03:07.890> fruit<00:03:08.280> hold<00:03:08.610> together<00:03:08.760> because<00:03:09.239> as

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
helps the fruit hold together because as

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.010 
helps the fruit hold together because as
it<00:03:09.570> cooks<00:03:09.840> this<00:03:10.350> will<00:03:10.500> soften<00:03:10.770> and<00:03:11.700> and<00:03:12.390> and

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
it cooks this will soften and and and

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.960 
it cooks this will soften and and and
you<00:03:13.230> know<00:03:13.260> might<00:03:13.560> become<00:03:13.860> a<00:03:13.890> little<00:03:13.980> bit<00:03:14.280> less

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
you know might become a little bit less

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.300 
you know might become a little bit less
it<00:03:15.300> won't<00:03:15.930> be<00:03:16.080> as<00:03:16.200> firm<00:03:16.470> as<00:03:16.500> it<00:03:16.709> is<00:03:16.980> when<00:03:17.160> it's

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
it won't be as firm as it is when it's

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.390 
it won't be as firm as it is when it's
raw<00:03:17.880> so<00:03:18.510> that's<00:03:19.140> it<00:03:19.350> it's<00:03:19.560> really<00:03:19.830> very<00:03:20.040> very

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
raw so that's it it's really very very

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.680 
raw so that's it it's really very very
easy<00:03:20.640> to<00:03:20.910> do<00:03:21.120> and<00:03:21.410> try<00:03:22.410> it<00:03:22.470> home
