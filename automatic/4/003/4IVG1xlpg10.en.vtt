00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:38.080
 Hello everyone 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:41.170
 so here I present you here the buggy 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:46.190
 my participation in contest number 15 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:49.910
 these techniques puggy mad style max 100% 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.900
 accumulated therefore no art book of 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.230
 controlled structure 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:57.170
 everything is really so she concluded so the 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.300
 module beyond being popular is 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.750
 composed of different modules train 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:05.390
 before his main career stage the 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:09.410
 hoops the top of the sky and 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:11.240
 some elements of decor first 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:15.610
 front train module so the train 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:18.440
 before provides two functions the direction 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.710
 and independent suspensions of 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.780
 partners fixed on a structure 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:27.950
 composed of technical dax and 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.630
 producers netizens mÃ¼ller whose 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:34.110
 second element these two four six blades 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:36.630
 of the chassis main flat bottom a model 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.690
 there is the steering flap he's 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.510
 pre installed here and you have command 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.460
 of the box that is to be seen with the 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:48.230
 connection here then either one of the module 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.230
 which shows Imperial 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.490
 the rear module one of the most complex 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.700
 to more complete so suspensions 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.729
 independent of shares and the other 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:02.520
 transmission becomes an oro differential 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.200
 which goes through a gearbox that 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.170
 the linear type so we had a 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:10.050
 box that will work from this type of 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:14.069
 situation then on the back of the 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.989
 box you have the two gears that 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:18.780
 will command both speed of 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:21.900
 walk to hops that finds here 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:24.360
 and when we continue to shoot at the 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:28.080
 command actually the crown and 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.180
 differential will train with 2 21 24 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.060
 and while they are going to turn sea between 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.940
 rio and so on that side you have two 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.890
 reports the box walk forward and from 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.780
 the other side you have the report of the 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.180
 box be marshall and the order of 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.519
 box is here by the seven 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:49.160
 items will connect on the dresser 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:51.770
 disapproved the seat module him 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.290
 new simple fixation directly 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.880
 on the vault of the chassis he has the 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.550
 particularity of having two functions 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:02.450
 integrated seasonal inclination of the 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:05.480
 folder and the advanced or the setting in 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:08.660
 depth of the century after the order 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.620
 of direction that will be worn then 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:14.840
 let's see how it all that 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:17.270
 seems not to start with the chassis on 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.480
 simply sees son and the seat module 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:23.150
 above so that's very healthy pine 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.850
 it's done we go back and fix the 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:29.810
 gimbal of detection on it that's that 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:33.080
 so does the mullah of direction and the 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:36.940
 flight according to a concert on 4th place 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.940
 toise on my computer frame 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:44.620
 and we just graft the module 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.620
 direction 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.670
 here 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.319
 relative 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.830
 gold now the erection and quality that 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:04:01.370
 it is by the conference by the letter v 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:03.049
 laughing suspension perpetrators 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.760
 we will now position the module 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:09.530
 back which is the propulsion mobile 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:15.910
 KHL initially it elongates 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:19.980
 box one sets the box control on 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:22.550
 the transmission air is finally here 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:25.840
 lyricist 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.840
 here is the musical framework 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.810
 here 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:44.780
 and the anaky sound box control 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.780
 forbidden on the record of the dough 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.170
 then 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.810
 on skates this module up we go 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:54.710
 simply fix the cradles of 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:57.980
 security so the very simple also 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.980
 we connect 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:10.150
 alas to connect the tunes on the front 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.150
 and surprise actions 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.960
 made 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.569
 here 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:26.250
 after that we will position ourselves against 

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:28.789
 lead forward the story of pilot 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:31.860
 to take a stall permanently 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:36.539
 face and will put their super 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:41.740
 proud she breaks whose inclination is 

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:45.639
 adjustable by tilting here of the system 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:47.800
 fixing that allows to align more 

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:50.490
 or less in offense 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.490
 or what is desired 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:55.380
 6 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.800
 and it just remains at that moment a 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.800
 material 

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:03.130
 the coronation or under a second round 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:12.340
 2 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:15.610
 and that's our buggy so goes up the 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:17.050
 modular design that is a bit of a 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.910
 road since in general are 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:21.220
 very crafty vehicles that are 

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:22.979
 manufactured one can imagine that as 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:25.389
 adults that may exist has abandoned 

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:30.750
 and so here we have the vehicle that 

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:30.750
 that works works perfectly 

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:37.230
 the valley and direction suspicion 

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:41.870
 very flexible since we have sand the 

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:41.870
 Functional seat window to the advanced 

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:46.220
 and the box with the reverse gear so 

00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:49.550
 we're just going ferland that's the goal 

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:51.650
 said we notice of 100 formations there 

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:56.110
 would have heart I'm going to go from the 

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:56.110
 back and their editors 

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.819
 the interim report 

00:07:03.249 --> 00:07:05.579
 here 

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:10.860
 in here is my little word participation 

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:13.880
 to stay 

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:16.780
 I hope I will have appreciated 

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:16.780
 our valued partner 

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:20.419
 my creations 

00:07:19.129 --> 00:07:22.779
 Thank you for your attention 

00:07:20.419 --> 00:07:22.779
 pension
