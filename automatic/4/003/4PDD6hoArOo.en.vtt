00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:18.910
 review your bases well that meets the project levels always the 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.910
 surface assuring 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.640
 in this case our border will serve as planting 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.869
 place the steel as indicated by the project 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.390
 pour the concrete and spread it 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.500
 as the image shows 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.500
 Miter concrete to release trapped air 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.900
 in this case the thickness is very thin and a rally we have the step 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.670
 in flush with the surface using mechanical or manual tools 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.230
 as a rule 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.230
 no longer explode 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.740
 in several ways to apply color to a gay tyson and in this case and powder colors 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:08.830
 we both know more about the surface to later integrate it cuyanas 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.830
 manuals 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.710
 the ocean as high 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.880
 is one of the bands 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.880
 subsequent to it 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.570
 the square brothers 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.570
 but it was not for the floors 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.040
 among the exhibitors 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.330
 the two savings banks 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.330
 in the first national b 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.500
 must be controller 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.010
 the Nobel Prize 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.300
 the secretary hand in hand to his 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.300
 the family was traveling 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.020
 in the level min 

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:17.980
 due to the surface that will escape 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.980
 to place the mold correctly 

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:24.609
 comes from the stamping as shown in the image 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.959
 Panama 

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:45.449
 once stanford finished 

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:48.449
 it is necessary to wash with a pressure washer 

00:02:50.619 --> 00:02:53.619
 cover details protecting very well 

00:02:56.249 --> 00:02:57.249
 I am me 

00:02:57.249 --> 00:03:01.010
 Regarding whether it has continued to rise and on the surface of the floor 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:08.750
 following these steps the museum will have backlash of 3 2% also the lawyer
