these patterns a little bit and try to

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.730 
these patterns a little bit and try to

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:21.619 
you can't typically stay in the same
position<00:03:19.489> there's<00:03:20.489> ways<00:03:20.730> to<00:03:20.910> do<00:03:21.060> that<00:03:21.239> you<00:03:21.449> can

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:21.629 
position there's ways to do that you can

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:23.270 
position there's ways to do that you can
do<00:03:21.750> that<00:03:21.930> if<00:03:22.109> you<00:03:22.199> learn<00:03:22.349> all<00:03:22.530> your<00:03:22.650> arpeggios

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
do that if you learn all your arpeggios

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.750 
do that if you learn all your arpeggios
properly<00:03:23.849> but<00:03:24.510> if<00:03:24.750> another<00:03:25.709> method<00:03:26.489> of<00:03:26.579> doing

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
properly but if another method of doing

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.449 
properly but if another method of doing
a<00:03:27.150> play<00:03:27.540> lead<00:03:27.780> guitar<00:03:27.810> is<00:03:28.260> to<00:03:28.470> move<00:03:28.859> with<00:03:29.280> the

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
a play lead guitar is to move with the

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.400 
a play lead guitar is to move with the
chord<00:03:29.730> as<00:03:30.239> opposed<00:03:30.599> to<00:03:30.750> staying<00:03:31.049> in<00:03:31.260> one<00:03:31.379> place

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
chord as opposed to staying in one place

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.860 
chord as opposed to staying in one place
so<00:03:32.250> you've<00:03:32.340> got<00:03:32.489> two<00:03:32.669> basic<00:03:33.090> methods<00:03:33.269> you

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
so you've got two basic methods you

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.650 
so you've got two basic methods you
either<00:03:34.019> stay<00:03:34.379> in<00:03:34.410> one<00:03:34.680> place<00:03:35.269> which<00:03:36.269> requires

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
either stay in one place which requires

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.270 
either stay in one place which requires
you<00:03:36.810> to<00:03:36.870> know<00:03:37.079> your<00:03:37.260> arpeggios<00:03:37.829> if<00:03:37.949> I'm<00:03:38.099> going

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
you to know your arpeggios if I'm going

because those are my important notes
when<00:03:59.490> the<00:03:59.610> band<00:03:59.820> plays<00:04:00.180> that<00:04:00.390> D<00:04:00.600> chord<00:04:00.900> I<00:04:00.990> got

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
when the band plays that D chord I got

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.310 
when the band plays that D chord I got
to<00:04:01.260> be<00:04:01.350> him<00:04:01.850> from<00:04:02.850> within<00:04:03.090> the<00:04:03.360> a<00:04:03.390> scale<00:04:03.960> that

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
to be him from within the a scale that

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.460 
to be him from within the a scale that
fit<00:04:05.220> over<00:04:05.490> the<00:04:05.610> D<00:04:05.760> arpeggio<00:04:06.360> and<00:04:06.660> likewise<00:04:07.440> for

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
fit over the D arpeggio and likewise for

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.170 
fit over the D arpeggio and likewise for
he<00:04:07.830> well<00:04:08.310> that's<00:04:08.460> a<00:04:08.550> little<00:04:08.730> tricky<00:04:09.060> that

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
he well that's a little tricky that

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.430 
he well that's a little tricky that
takes<00:04:09.420> a<00:04:09.480> little<00:04:09.600> more<00:04:09.720> time<00:04:09.780> to<00:04:10.080> get<00:04:10.200> used<00:04:10.350> to

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
takes a little more time to get used to

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.600 
takes a little more time to get used to
doing<00:04:10.650> that<00:04:10.830> you'll<00:04:10.950> need<00:04:11.040> to<00:04:11.130> work<00:04:11.340> with<00:04:11.490> your

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
doing that you'll need to work with your

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.900 
doing that you'll need to work with your
arpeggios<00:04:11.880> a<00:04:12.210> bunch<00:04:12.540> to<00:04:12.810> do<00:04:12.930> that<00:04:13.700> so<00:04:14.700> the

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
arpeggios a bunch to do that so the

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.660 
arpeggios a bunch to do that so the
other<00:04:14.940> way<00:04:15.570> of<00:04:15.810> pursuing<00:04:16.709> Liga<00:04:17.160> tart<00:04:17.400> playing

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:17.670 
other way of pursuing Liga tart playing

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.600 
other way of pursuing Liga tart playing
is<00:04:17.850> to<00:04:17.880> move<00:04:18.390> with<00:04:18.750> the<00:04:18.930> chord<00:04:19.200> and<00:04:19.350> I<00:04:19.890> suggest

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:20.610 
is to move with the chord and I suggest

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:22.960 
is to move with the chord and I suggest
highly<00:04:21.299> than<00:04:21.480> you<00:04:21.660> take<00:04:22.290> this<00:04:22.500> main

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
highly than you take this main

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.540 
highly than you take this main
pentatonic<00:04:23.970> shape<00:04:24.530> and<00:04:25.530> move<00:04:26.070> it<00:04:26.280> with<00:04:26.400> the

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
pentatonic shape and move it with the

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.420 
pentatonic shape and move it with the
cord<00:04:27.350> basically<00:04:28.350> wherever<00:04:28.530> your<00:04:28.860> Barre<00:04:29.130> chord

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
cord basically wherever your Barre chord

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:31.130 
cord basically wherever your Barre chord
would<00:04:29.610> go<00:04:29.790> that's<00:04:30.180> where<00:04:30.390> you<00:04:30.510> put<00:04:30.690> that<00:04:30.870> shape

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
would go that's where you put that shape

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.290 
would go that's where you put that shape
if<00:04:31.560> your<00:04:31.740> Barre<00:04:31.950> chord<00:04:32.220> is<00:04:32.310> in<00:04:32.520> the<00:04:32.850> fifth<00:04:33.090> fret

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
if your Barre chord is in the fifth fret

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.180 
if your Barre chord is in the fifth fret
and<00:04:33.480> that's<00:04:33.600> where<00:04:33.840> you<00:04:33.900> Seamus<00:04:34.350> if<00:04:34.650> your

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
and that's where you Seamus if your

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.000 
and that's where you Seamus if your
Barre<00:04:35.370> chord<00:04:35.640> would<00:04:35.760> then<00:04:35.940> go<00:04:36.120> to<00:04:36.150> D<00:04:36.480> and<00:04:37.200> the

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
Barre chord would then go to D and the

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.040 
Barre chord would then go to D and the
tenth<00:04:38.250> fret<00:04:38.520> I'm<00:04:39.030> simplifying<00:04:39.360> it<00:04:39.720> could<00:04:39.900> be

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
tenth fret I'm simplifying it could be

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.990 
tenth fret I'm simplifying it could be
this<00:04:40.410> D<00:04:40.680> over<00:04:40.920> here<00:04:40.950> but<00:04:41.250> whatever<00:04:41.610> it's<00:04:41.760> a<00:04:41.820> D

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
this D over here but whatever it's a D
