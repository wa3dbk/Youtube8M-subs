that it's very awesome and this is his

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.600 
that it's very awesome and this is his
boot<00:01:18.560> dragon<00:01:19.560> Zord<00:01:19.710> flute<00:01:20.180> very<00:01:21.180> cool<00:01:21.600> I<00:01:22.610> think

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
boot dragon Zord flute very cool I think

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.820 
boot dragon Zord flute very cool I think
they<00:01:23.700> did<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.880> pretty<00:01:24.060> good<00:01:24.330> job<00:01:24.390> designing<00:01:25.320> it

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
they did a pretty good job designing it

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.370 
they did a pretty good job designing it
for<00:01:26.340> being<00:01:26.520> so<00:01:26.729> small<00:01:26.790> I<00:01:27.299> still<00:01:27.810> think<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.170> is

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
for being so small I still think it is

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.469 
for being so small I still think it is
fairly<00:01:29.280> boot<00:01:29.670> filled<00:01:29.909> at<00:01:30.060> least<00:01:31.220> back<00:01:32.220> there

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
fairly boot filled at least back there

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.050 
fairly boot filled at least back there
and<00:01:33.479> there<00:01:33.840> you<00:01:34.290> can<00:01:34.500> see<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:35.400> design<00:01:35.670> on<00:01:35.880> his

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
and there you can see the design on his

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.069 
and there you can see the design on his
belt<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:37.040> also<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.280> legs<00:01:38.520> have<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:39.360> little

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
belt and also the legs have a little

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.499 
belt and also the legs have a little
articulation<00:01:40.920> they<00:01:41.729> can't<00:01:41.970> he<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.270> do<00:01:42.420> the

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
articulation they can't he to do the

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.289 
articulation they can't he to do the
splits<00:01:42.840> um<00:01:43.649> anyway<00:01:44.130> but<00:01:44.820> you<00:01:44.939> have<00:01:45.119> the

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
splits um anyway but you have the

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.510 
splits um anyway but you have the
regular<00:01:45.540> leg<00:01:45.930> torn<00:01:46.229> up<00:01:46.350> top<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.369> knee

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
regular leg torn up top and the knee

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.149 
regular leg torn up top and the knee
joint<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.000> then<00:01:48.210> this<00:01:48.750> part<00:01:49.140> turns<00:01:49.560> like<00:01:49.920> this

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
joint and then this part turns like this

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.859 
joint and then this part turns like this
instead<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:50.820> having<00:01:50.939> like<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.270> regular<00:01:51.479> foot

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
instead of having like a regular foot

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.340 
instead of having like a regular foot
joint<00:01:52.140> so<00:01:52.920> it's<00:01:53.189> still<00:01:53.399> a<00:01:53.430> pretty<00:01:53.640> cool<00:01:53.880> figure

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
joint so it's still a pretty cool figure

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.899 
joint so it's still a pretty cool figure
I'm<00:01:55.350> definitely<00:01:55.890> gonna<00:01:56.040> be<00:01:56.219> collecting<00:01:56.700> these

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
I'm definitely gonna be collecting these

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.090 
I'm definitely gonna be collecting these
legacy<00:01:57.840> figures<00:01:58.350> because<00:01:58.619> I<00:01:58.740> think<00:01:58.799> they're

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
legacy figures because I think they're

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.840
