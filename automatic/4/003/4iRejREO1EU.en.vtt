00:01:39.309 --> 00:01:39.319 
ice for our drink so now to make the

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:41.410 
ice for our drink so now to make the
actual<00:01:39.649> watermelon<00:01:40.459> drink<00:01:40.789> just<00:01:41.060> take<00:01:41.270> your

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
actual watermelon drink just take your

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.179 
actual watermelon drink just take your
watermelon<00:01:41.929> plop<00:01:42.259> them<00:01:42.530> in<00:01:42.679> your<00:01:42.770> blender

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
watermelon plop them in your blender

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:46.300 
watermelon plop them in your blender
turn<00:01:43.939> it<00:01:44.119> on<00:01:44.270> and<00:01:44.569> blend<00:01:45.170> that<00:01:45.439> baby<00:01:45.679> until<00:01:45.950> you

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
turn it on and blend that baby until you

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.800 
turn it on and blend that baby until you
