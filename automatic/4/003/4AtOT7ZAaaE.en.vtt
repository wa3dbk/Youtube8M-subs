00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:58.060
 Aubergines from the area Luis 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:07.849
 of the most typical dishes we have in 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:10.099
 the region of almadén concretely there is 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:13.639
 many more but we have decided on 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:16.639
 two suckling pig in the area and 

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:18.200
 eggplant with which we have my 

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:20.690
 conferences have with those of almagro 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:24.230
 which are the most famous in the region 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:26.300
 good as you know here we have a 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.000
 long history of the mil and 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:31.310

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.950
 accompany the moments when he left 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.930
 Mine and eggplants as is 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:39.440
 they raised in the orchards here from the 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.870
 zone and it differs with other places 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.310
 more together why is it cooked it 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.700
 do with vinegar they put a 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:49.010
 Stays inside and everything was done at home 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.150
 and they stayed in the gardens while 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.550
 others maybe put them 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.530
 peppers are more vinegar 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.110
 much more tender with the output and 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.150
 peppers and then we have the suckling pig 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.580
 that to have that flavor it has to be 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.810
 what is clear here is that it is not 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.340
 I left to come enjoy 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.020

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.930
