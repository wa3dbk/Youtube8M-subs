00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.400
 Hello, my name is Matti, I am the manager of a car service center in Herzliya 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.740
 And I want to talk to you a bit about the subject of car oils 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.100
 There are basically 3 types of oils 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.720
 Which are divided into mineral oils, synthetic oils and semi-synthetic oils 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.840
 Mineral oils are ordinary oils produced from natural oil. They are of poor quality and are also the cheapest 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.640
 Synthetic oils are of the highest quality 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.280
 Made of materials with serious additives 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.560
 They are very expensive and they are not needed for the standard cars on the road 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.240
 They are for luxury cars 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.880
 Our cars, which are currently moving and handling every 15,000 kilometers 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:55.960
 Semi-synthetic oils that are mixed-mineral with synthetic additives are good enough 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.920
 But it is important to use the appropriate oils for the vehicle 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.680
 For each type of vehicle, the manufacturer's book says exactly which oil to use 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.780
 Do not save on the issue of oils 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.180
 I want to say here a comment about oils and treatments in general 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:18.180
 Between treatment and treatment spend about 10,000, NIS 12,000 on fuel 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.940
 When you come to the garage to replace oil with an oil filter, you save about NIS 400 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.580
 Why? Then because of these 400 shekels, the engine will go and you will spend another 10,000 shekels 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:36.980
 I brought here an example of oil from a car that was treated in a cheap garage with cheap oil 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.340
 And that's the result 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.660
 You see here in the glass remnants of oil extracted from an engine 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.000
 Oil of very poor quality and after it worked in these engine results 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:55.920
 Now it's worth remembering that these results can also be from replacing the oils not the last one, even replacing oils once or twice or three times 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.700
 The remains remain in the engine 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.380
 These residues are caught inside the oil passages 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.500
 And of course the oil does not fulfill its mission 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.880
 The result is that in the end when you continue driving with such quality oil, the engine goes 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.340
 So it's true that it's not like gasoline on which you travel and you can not move without it 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.340
 But the damage and the importance of lubrication and oil to prevent, at least as much as fuel
