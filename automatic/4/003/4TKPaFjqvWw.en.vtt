 emperor as well as the Mongolian 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.330
 run out of it so the huge number 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.300
 different vertebrates 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.720

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:33.750
 subdivided around these it should go today 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:35.790
 the vertebrate classes first of all

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.339
 the spine owes its name 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.909

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.850
 vertebrate class 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:19.890
 these are the fish the amphibians which 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.310
 to be in logical and logical 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:26.689
 subdivide frog groove 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.689
 then we have the creepers 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.060
 the birds and last but not least the
