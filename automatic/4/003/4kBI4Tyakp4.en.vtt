 all those who are fans of the 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.380
 videogames or at least spend a lot 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:10.300
 time on the internet will have been found 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:13.059
 at some point with the live trailer 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.740
 action the legend of zelda you already know that 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:16.240
 so great trailer in glue karim of time 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.580
 with real characters and effects 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.869
 specials quite well achieved not 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.430
 it would be a long time before someone 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:22.750
 you lower the illusions of without dowries 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.000
 that this was a joke of the day of the 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.880
 innocent people who took the idn there by the 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.900
 2008 but to take away the feeling of 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.699
 who has played with your feelings 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.560
 When you had not left on the altar you should 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.540
 know that this epic trophy involved 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.400
 More than 20 people a professional team 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.990
 of filming and many hours of editing and 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.640
 special effects and you have to do 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.530
 emphasis on the latter since the 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.780
 director of the rainford film team 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.250
 sambol with caixa all these effects in 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.540
 the computer of your house what in 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.130
 reality is an inspiration for all 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.230
 new fans of animation and 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.120
 special effects if you could do it 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.640
 with accessible technology in 2008 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.140
 imagine what you could do in 2015 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.790
 will be in the description for 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.040
 give them a look I hope that 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.630
 put some English and like the fans 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.950
 of the world have already had to repair their 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.989
 broken hearts on more than one occasion 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.460
 from the legend of xinglong in the 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.540
 street fighter until the movie the 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.250
 dance action 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.740
 anyone would think that in this era 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.810
 a joke would be easily recognizable 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.730
 although the long expectation about the 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.070
 higher remake is more initiated by a 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.420
 fan video proved otherwise now 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.940
 that a joke is much more credible 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.220
 when in fact it is not about any 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:28.110
 joke and sure they will be thinking of 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.110
 what is this guy talking about 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.060
 pass 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:39.799
 plus 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.380
 this thing that we just saw is the pilot 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.810
 for the production of a movie 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.130
 animated the legend of zelda the authors 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.360
 of said court are not other than 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:05.380
 artists of the company image imagine the 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:07.390
 company that made astroboy the same as 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:12.060
 he made the movie in cg and of the turtles 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:15.010
 ninja it seems that nobody saw how 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.020
 in the year 2007 this company made a 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.000
 animated cut of one minute 37 seconds 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.500
 of duration to try to convince 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.120
 nintendo to make an animated movie 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.970
 inspired by the story of his game more 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.230
 famous ocarina of time are unknown 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.600
 details but it seems that the 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.980
 negotiations came to nothing and the 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.870
 fourth was confined between infinity 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.459
 of files dependent on testing and not 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.660
 had come to light why 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:36.280
 nobody knew about it until 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.290
 relatively little time though 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.270
 creepy style pasta the chapter 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.530
 lost of was found by someone 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.450
 that played between the archives of 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.400
 supervisor of the year of the adam company 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.200
 jones but far from being a story of 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.790
 terror for all this is something really 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.590
 amazing in it we see a group of 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.360
 gentlemen in caravan going through a 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.190
 place similar to that of duval usa and for 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.959
 escort a maiden and a treasure 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.530
 but they are intercepted on the way by 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.330
 some monkeys 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.000
 and the maid who turns out to be a cell 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.860
 you have to defend yourself but not alone since 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.690
 appears in coffee mare 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.819
 defend it and then see how the 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.130
 earning more broke several that you have 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:10.720
 seen in all your life come on stage the 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:12.220
 video ends showing the cell line to 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.959
 point of fighting against this powerful 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.959
 enemy and leaving us with a tremendous 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:17.470
 javier sada pandey mangonea stuck in 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.510
 throat 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.130
 speaking on technical issues the 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.410
 teaser is pretty well accomplished in its 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.660
 animation fluency sensation and charge of 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.430
 epic action medieval and heroic own 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.260
 of the products enters however 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.910
 we can see that the models and designs of 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.160
 the characters are a little different to 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.840
 what we are used to we could 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.580
 catalog it as quite American 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:40.540
 we could say that the models are a 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:43.000
 Polygonal little square with excess 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:46.000
 chin maybe the word is 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.470
 stylized is a characteristic of 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.970
 American productions that tend to 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:50.800
 get away from the organic forms and 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.110
 natural and look for something more geometric and 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.880
 easy to create and animate what creates a 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.010
 contrast a bit strange comparing with 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:58.930
 the style that we are used to 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:01.390
 even if it was in 2007 and by then 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:03.970
 the wind waker had already left and that year 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.830
 came out the phantom or glass so it seemed 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.660
 the time of experimentation for the saga 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.030
 and this was a proposal that stayed in 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.890
 that a proposal the movie of the 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:14.080
 ninja turtles came out that year and it happened 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:16.090
 unnoticed and the income generated 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:19.000
 by astroboy in 2009 provoked that and 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.979
 May wrote his room in 2010 and 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.419
 all these ideas will be buried 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:24.520
 waiting for the curious boom of 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:25.870
 internet discover only we have left 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.669
 imagine how this could have been 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.350
 movie knowing that to make a 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:31.240
 movie are always taken many times and 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:33.010
 creative taking the jobs more 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.840
 Relevant made by the company I 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:36.729
 I would dare to say that the final product 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:39.010
 it would not have been so impressive 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:41.260
 as we would like but something that would be worth 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:43.900
 It's worth seeing how they think it would have been 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:45.550
 the animated movie of zelda you can 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.260
 behave your ideas theories and 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.060
 frustrations in the comment box 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.800
 who removes and someday we can see 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.520
 our favorite legendary saga in the 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.520
 screen tier
