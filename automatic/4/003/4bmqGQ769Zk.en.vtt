00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
passive and that's the best way it is

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.100

some times there's some newcomers and
you<00:03:12.890> trying<00:03:13.100> to<00:03:13.160> figure<00:03:13.370> out<00:03:13.549> how<00:03:13.700> to<00:03:13.760> how<00:03:13.970> do

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
you trying to figure out how to how do

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.789 
you trying to figure out how to how do
they<00:03:14.209> play<00:03:14.420> and<00:03:14.690> you're<00:03:15.290> just<00:03:15.440> trying<00:03:15.680> to

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
they play and you're just trying to

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:17.530 
they play and you're just trying to
think<00:03:15.950> all<00:03:16.280> the<00:03:16.459> six<00:03:16.670> phases<00:03:16.880> like<00:03:17.209> how<00:03:17.390> you've

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
think all the six phases like how you've

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.320 
think all the six phases like how you've
been<00:03:17.720> playing<00:03:17.959> with<00:03:18.110> them<00:03:18.350> and<00:03:18.620> how<00:03:19.400> you<00:03:19.820> can

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
been playing with them and how you can

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.539 
been playing with them and how you can
probably<00:03:20.600> do<00:03:21.019> something<00:03:21.049> a<00:03:21.500> little<00:03:22.040> different

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
probably do something a little different

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:24.820 
probably do something a little different
now<00:03:22.610> that<00:03:22.970> you<00:03:23.299> should<00:03:23.480> change<00:03:23.660> I'd<00:03:24.530> like<00:03:24.680> to

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
now that you should change I'd like to

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.199 
now that you should change I'd like to
change<00:03:24.980> my<00:03:25.190> game<00:03:25.250> a<00:03:25.370> little<00:03:25.489> bit<00:03:25.730> all<00:03:25.880> the<00:03:25.910> time

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
change my game a little bit all the time

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.580 
change my game a little bit all the time
and<00:03:26.920> and<00:03:29.049> what<00:03:30.049> comes<00:03:30.290> to<00:03:30.410> the<00:03:30.440> understanding

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
and and what comes to the understanding

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.449 
and and what comes to the understanding
of<00:03:31.130> the<00:03:31.280> game<00:03:31.430> I<00:03:31.489> think<00:03:32.030> I<00:03:32.590> think<00:03:33.590> that's<00:03:33.830> we're

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
of the game I think I think that's we're

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.100 
of the game I think I think that's we're
all<00:03:34.640> pretty<00:03:34.940> far<00:03:35.269> in

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
all pretty far in

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.640 
all pretty far in
games<00:03:36.440> but<00:03:37.840> there's<00:03:38.840> a<00:03:38.900> lot<00:03:38.990> of<00:03:39.080> new<00:03:39.230> games<00:03:39.440> to

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
games but there's a lot of new games to

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.310 
games but there's a lot of new games to
that<00:03:39.860> I<00:03:39.890> need<00:03:40.310> to<00:03:40.490> get<00:03:40.580> a<00:03:40.640> better<00:03:40.790> and<00:03:41.120> and<00:03:41.600> it's

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
that I need to get a better and and it's

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.010 
that I need to get a better and and it's
it's<00:03:42.680> a<00:03:42.770> learning<00:03:43.010> process<00:03:43.160> I<00:03:43.700> think<00:03:43.940> I<00:03:44.210> just

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.020 
it's a learning process I think I just

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.660 
it's a learning process I think I just
hoped<00:03:45.380> it's<00:03:45.560> not<00:03:45.680> gonna<00:03:45.830> be<00:03:46.040> appointed<00:03:46.520> when

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
hoped it's not gonna be appointed when

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.910 
hoped it's not gonna be appointed when
my<00:03:46.880> games<00:03:47.120> gonna<00:03:47.420> go<00:03:47.600> a<00:03:47.630> little<00:03:47.780> bit<00:03:47.930> down<00:03:48.170> huh

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
my games gonna go a little bit down huh

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.280 
my games gonna go a little bit down huh
I<00:03:49.250> like<00:03:49.850> where<00:03:50.060> I'm<00:03:50.210> at<00:03:50.240> now<00:03:50.720> and<00:03:51.910> I<00:03:53.050> think<00:03:54.050> the

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
I like where I'm at now and I think the

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.020 
I like where I'm at now and I think the
biggest<00:03:54.500> part<00:03:54.740> in<00:03:54.920> in<00:03:55.250> a<00:03:55.370> learning<00:03:55.640> process

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
biggest part in in a learning process

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.470 
biggest part in in a learning process
you<00:03:56.300> do<00:03:56.750> when<00:03:57.470> you're<00:03:57.680> not<00:03:57.830> playing<00:03:58.040> poker

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 
you do when you're not playing poker

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.120 
you do when you're not playing poker
that<00:03:59.480> when<00:03:59.690> you<00:03:59.780> quit<00:03:59.990> your<00:04:00.140> session<00:04:00.620> playing

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
that when you quit your session playing

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:02.830 
that when you quit your session playing
you<00:04:01.340> have<00:04:01.490> to<00:04:01.610> think<00:04:01.850> all<00:04:02.120> the<00:04:02.300> situations

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
you have to think all the situations

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.480 
you have to think all the situations
that<00:04:02.870> what<00:04:03.110> you<00:04:03.440> could<00:04:04.340> have<00:04:04.370> done

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:04.490 
that what you could have done

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:05.980 
that what you could have done
differently<00:04:04.610> where<00:04:05.390> you<00:04:05.540> could<00:04:05.690> have<00:04:05.750> said

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:05.990 
differently where you could have said

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:08.860 
differently where you could have said
money<00:04:06.400> did<00:04:07.400> you<00:04:07.520> make<00:04:07.700> any<00:04:07.880> bad<00:04:08.060> decisions<00:04:08.240> and

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
money did you make any bad decisions and

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.280 
money did you make any bad decisions and
why<00:04:09.170> did<00:04:09.350> you<00:04:09.380> make<00:04:09.680> those<00:04:09.950> and<00:04:10.280> and<00:04:10.520> then<00:04:11.330> just

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
why did you make those and and then just

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:13.600 
why did you make those and and then just
think<00:04:12.380> about<00:04:12.530> the<00:04:12.740> next<00:04:12.890> time<00:04:13.040> like<00:04:13.400> how<00:04:13.550> you

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
think about the next time like how you

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.140 
think about the next time like how you
gonna<00:04:14.620> try<00:04:15.620> to<00:04:15.650> do<00:04:15.830> better<00:04:16.040> and<00:04:16.340> remember<00:04:16.820> if

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
gonna try to do better and remember if

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:18.460 
gonna try to do better and remember if
you<00:04:17.269> made<00:04:17.450> any<00:04:17.630> mistakes<00:04:18.019> that<00:04:18.140> you're<00:04:18.350> not

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
you made any mistakes that you're not

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:19.750 
you made any mistakes that you're not
gonna<00:04:18.620> do<00:04:18.769> with<00:04:18.829> those<00:04:18.950> mistakes<00:04:19.340> again<00:04:19.519> you

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
gonna do with those mistakes again you

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.580 
gonna do with those mistakes again you
know<00:04:19.850> you<00:04:20.570> only<00:04:20.930> learn<00:04:21.169> from<00:04:21.200> your<00:04:21.530> own

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
know you only learn from your own

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.370 
know you only learn from your own
mistakes<00:04:21.739> I<00:04:22.430> think<00:04:22.720> there<00:04:23.720> seem<00:04:23.900> to<00:04:23.930> be<00:04:24.080> so

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
mistakes I think there seem to be so

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.110 
mistakes I think there seem to be so
many<00:04:24.590> great<00:04:25.010> players<00:04:25.310> coming<00:04:25.730> out<00:04:25.910> of<00:04:26.030> the

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
many great players coming out of the

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.570 
many great players coming out of the
woodwork<00:04:26.510> that<00:04:26.840> it<00:04:27.200> seems<00:04:27.560> poker<00:04:28.100> is<00:04:28.310> getting

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
woodwork that it seems poker is getting

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.340 
woodwork that it seems poker is getting
harder<00:04:29.000> to<00:04:29.300> make<00:04:29.450> money<00:04:29.630> out<00:04:29.810> because<00:04:29.990> all<00:04:30.200> the

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
harder to make money out because all the

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:31.810 
harder to make money out because all the
players<00:04:30.590> seem<00:04:30.950> to<00:04:30.980> be<00:04:31.130> getting<00:04:31.220> better<00:04:31.610> and

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
players seem to be getting better and

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:34.210 
players seem to be getting better and
better<00:04:31.880> do<00:04:32.300> you<00:04:32.390> find<00:04:32.570> that's<00:04:32.690> the<00:04:32.870> case<00:04:33.220> yeah

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
better do you find that's the case yeah

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.020 
better do you find that's the case yeah
I<00:04:34.640> think<00:04:34.940> I<00:04:36.310> think<00:04:37.310> the<00:04:37.400> average<00:04:37.550> level

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
I think I think the average level

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:39.520 
I think I think the average level
whatever<00:04:38.270> people<00:04:38.720> are<00:04:38.930> playing<00:04:39.200> there

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
whatever people are playing there

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.030 
whatever people are playing there
they're<00:04:40.280> all<00:04:40.460> now<00:04:41.110> better<00:04:42.110> and<00:04:42.320> more<00:04:42.470> exited

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
they're all now better and more exited

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.710 
they're all now better and more exited
more<00:04:43.729> experienced<00:04:44.270> players<00:04:44.540> there<00:04:44.840> and<00:04:46.720> for

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
more experienced players there and for

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.800 
more experienced players there and for
the<00:04:47.810> high<00:04:47.960> stakes<00:04:48.290> I<00:04:48.500> think<00:04:49.000> also<00:04:50.000> everything

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
the high stakes I think also everything

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.320 
the high stakes I think also everything
is<00:04:51.310> it's<00:04:52.310> a<00:04:52.400> little<00:04:52.550> tougher<00:04:52.910> but<00:04:53.060> on<00:04:53.210> the

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 
is it's a little tougher but on the

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.900 
is it's a little tougher but on the
other<00:04:53.419> hand<00:04:53.540> there's<00:04:54.250> so<00:04:55.250> much<00:04:55.400> more<00:04:55.610> players

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
other hand there's so much more players

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:00.520 
other hand there's so much more players
so<00:04:56.710> it's<00:04:57.790> it's<00:04:58.790> it's<00:04:59.300> more<00:04:59.479> yeah<00:04:59.870> more<00:05:00.200> faces

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
so it's it's it's more yeah more faces

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.950 
so it's it's it's more yeah more faces
too<00:05:00.680> so<00:05:00.919> it's<00:05:01.100> easier<00:05:01.340> to<00:05:01.400> find<00:05:01.520> a<00:05:01.910> final<00:05:02.450> table

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
too so it's easier to find a final table

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.900 
too so it's easier to find a final table
stuff<00:05:03.520> but<00:05:04.520> if<00:05:05.390> I<00:05:05.750> cope<00:05:05.960> if<00:05:06.680> I<00:05:07.100> go<00:05:07.250> back<00:05:07.490> to<00:05:07.700> like

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:07.910 
stuff but if I cope if I go back to like

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:11.080 
stuff but if I cope if I go back to like
six<00:05:08.720> years<00:05:08.810> seven<00:05:09.169> six<00:05:09.950> five<00:05:10.130> years<00:05:10.460> four

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
six years seven six five years four

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.600 
six years seven six five years four
years<00:05:11.410> when<00:05:12.410> those<00:05:12.590> games<00:05:12.860> were<00:05:13.010> very<00:05:13.250> low

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:13.610 
years when those games were very low

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.050 
years when those games were very low
very<00:05:13.880> low<00:05:13.910> I<00:05:14.830> think<00:05:15.830> you<00:05:16.100> know<00:05:16.250> no<00:05:16.700> one<00:05:16.880> could

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
very low I think you know no one could

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:21.790 
very low I think you know no one could
play<00:05:17.650> decently<00:05:18.650> good<00:05:18.860> poker<00:05:19.150> it<00:05:20.150> was<00:05:20.330> all<00:05:20.800> all

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
play decently good poker it was all all

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.350 
play decently good poker it was all all
bad<00:05:22.160> players<00:05:22.490> you<00:05:23.479> know<00:05:23.740> that's<00:05:24.740> my<00:05:24.919> opinion

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
bad players you know that's my opinion

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.320 
bad players you know that's my opinion
they're<00:05:26.360> just<00:05:26.570> hard<00:05:26.780> and<00:05:27.020> soft<00:05:27.290> down<00:05:28.330> the

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330 
they're just hard and soft down the

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.650 
they're just hard and soft down the
games<00:05:29.780> are<00:05:29.930> just<00:05:30.080> hard<00:05:30.290> and<00:05:30.500> soft<00:05:30.770> now<00:05:31.660> yeah

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:32.660 
games are just hard and soft now yeah

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.670 
games are just hard and soft now yeah
but<00:05:33.260> I<00:05:33.290> mean<00:05:34.090> it's<00:05:35.090> just<00:05:35.410> there's<00:05:36.410> a<00:05:36.470> lot<00:05:36.560> of

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 
but I mean it's just there's a lot of

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.110 
but I mean it's just there's a lot of
players<00:05:36.890> that<00:05:37.010> they<00:05:37.250> come<00:05:37.720> they<00:05:38.720> come<00:05:38.930> to<00:05:39.140> the

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:45.459 
they come to the poker world and they
they've<00:05:43.909> been<00:05:44.120> a<00:05:44.150> lot<00:05:44.389> of<00:05:44.479> money<00:05:44.689> they<00:05:45.229> stop

playing<00:05:45.590> high-stakes<00:05:45.889> and<00:05:46.430> they<00:05:46.520> have<00:05:46.699> a<00:05:46.729> very

00:05:46.929 --> 00:05:46.939 
playing high-stakes and they have a very

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:49.959 
playing high-stakes and they have a very
strong<00:05:47.240> game<00:05:47.710> they<00:05:48.710> play<00:05:48.949> six<00:05:49.340> months<00:05:49.759> very

00:05:49.959 --> 00:05:49.969 
strong game they play six months very

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:52.360 
strong game they play six months very
strong<00:05:50.449> poker<00:05:51.139> or<00:05:51.349> a<00:05:51.379> couple<00:05:51.680> of<00:05:51.889> months<00:05:52.219> and

strong poker or a couple of months and

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:54.850 
strong poker or a couple of months and
then<00:05:52.639> in<00:05:53.449> one<00:05:53.599> point<00:05:53.810> they<00:05:53.990> start<00:05:54.469> steaming

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860 
then in one point they start steaming

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.700 
then in one point they start steaming
and<00:05:55.280> when<00:05:55.939> they<00:05:56.150> when<00:05:56.900> they<00:05:57.020> go<00:05:57.169> for<00:05:57.349> losing

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:57.710 
and when they when they go for losing

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:01.689 
and when they when they go for losing
straight<00:05:58.479> they<00:05:59.979> they<00:06:00.979> can<00:06:01.189> handle<00:06:01.460> those<00:06:01.669> as

00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:01.699 
straight they they can handle those as

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:06.339 
straight they they can handle those as
well<00:06:02.419> and<00:06:02.629> then<00:06:03.250> they<00:06:04.250> end<00:06:04.430> up<00:06:04.520> I<00:06:04.729> guess<00:06:05.349> making

00:06:06.339 --> 00:06:06.349 
well and then they end up I guess making

00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:09.129 
well and then they end up I guess making
a<00:06:06.680> little<00:06:06.919> bit<00:06:07.039> bad<00:06:07.219> place<00:06:07.520> and<00:06:07.819> and<00:06:08.750> it's<00:06:08.990> just

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:09.139 
a little bit bad place and and it's just

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:11.589 
a little bit bad place and and it's just
you<00:06:09.259> know<00:06:09.580> it's<00:06:10.580> a<00:06:10.669> tougher<00:06:11.060> you<00:06:11.270> have<00:06:11.449> to

00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:11.599 
you know it's a tougher you have to
