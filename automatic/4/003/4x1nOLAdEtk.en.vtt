insane<00:01:52.110> acceleration<00:01:52.860> mode<00:01:53.040> which<00:01:53.220> I'm<00:01:53.340> going

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
insane acceleration mode which I'm going

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.830 
insane acceleration mode which I'm going
to<00:01:53.549> engage<00:01:53.670> now<00:01:55.250> yep<00:01:56.250> there<00:01:56.700> we<00:01:56.820> go<00:01:56.939> right<00:01:57.240> all

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
that was close on the acceleration but

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
is even faster just off the line you

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.040 
is even faster just off the line you
just<00:02:33.280> get<00:02:33.610> pushed<00:02:34.000> back<00:02:34.269> in<00:02:34.420> your<00:02:34.540> seat<00:02:34.840> it's

incredible<00:02:35.980> the<00:02:36.130> traction<00:02:36.730> but<00:02:37.510> then<00:02:37.660> above

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
incredible the traction but then above

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:39.840 
incredible the traction but then above
about<00:02:38.200> 85<00:02:38.709> miles<00:02:39.010> an<00:02:39.130> hour<00:02:39.250> you<00:02:39.370> just<00:02:39.519> feel<00:02:39.700> it

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
about 85 miles an hour you just feel it

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.059 
about 85 miles an hour you just feel it
start<00:02:40.090> to<00:02:40.180> tail<00:02:40.540> off<00:02:40.569> and<00:02:40.959> the<00:02:41.019> Porsche<00:02:41.319> just

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
start to tail off and the Porsche just

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.180 
start to tail off and the Porsche just
gets<00:02:42.370> into<00:02:42.640> its<00:02:42.790> stride<00:02:43.150> and<00:02:43.450> then<00:02:44.069> well<00:02:45.069> on

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
gets into its stride and then well on

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.979 
gets into its stride and then well on
the<00:02:45.310> brakes<00:02:45.580> those<00:02:45.850> carbon<00:02:46.299> ceramics<00:02:46.750> on<00:02:46.900> the

the brakes those carbon ceramics on the

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:48.920 
the brakes those carbon ceramics on the
Porsche<00:02:47.230> they<00:02:47.470> are<00:02:47.680> just<00:02:47.950> incredible<00:02:48.670> it

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
Porsche they are just incredible it

Porsche they are just incredible it
ability<00:02:49.930> to<00:02:50.110> stop<00:02:50.680> so<00:02:50.920> quickly<00:02:51.400> is<00:02:51.459> amazing<00:02:52.209> I

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
ability to stop so quickly is amazing I

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.660 
ability to stop so quickly is amazing I
mean<00:02:53.290> the<00:02:53.410> tizzle<00:02:53.769> is<00:02:53.890> no<00:02:54.010> slouch<00:02:54.310> on<00:02:54.549> the

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
mean the tizzle is no slouch on the

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.520 
mean the tizzle is no slouch on the
brakes<00:02:54.910> but<00:02:57.120> I've<00:02:58.120> got<00:02:58.299> so<00:02:58.510> surprised<00:02:59.049> by<00:02:59.319> how

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
brakes but I've got so surprised by how

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.210 
brakes but I've got so surprised by how
much<00:03:00.360> how<00:03:01.360> much<00:03:01.540> more<00:03:02.140> distance<00:03:03.040> there's

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
much how much more distance there's

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:04.259 
much how much more distance there's
needed<00:03:03.580> to<00:03:03.670> stop

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
needed to stop

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.599 
needed to stop
so<00:03:04.930> the<00:03:05.200> Porsche<00:03:05.440> was<00:03:05.500> a<00:03:05.650> clear<00:03:05.890> winner<00:03:06.100> but

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:06.609 
so the Porsche was a clear winner but

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:08.550 
so the Porsche was a clear winner but
exactly<00:03:07.000> how<00:03:07.209> fast<00:03:07.510> were<00:03:07.840> our<00:03:07.959> contenders

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
exactly how fast were our contenders

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.009 
exactly how fast were our contenders

distance but don't underestimate the
