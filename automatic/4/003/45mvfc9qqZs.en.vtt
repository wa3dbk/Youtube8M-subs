just to get rid of old product they had
an<00:02:18.690> overstock<00:02:19.080> of<00:02:19.290> these<00:02:19.410> they're<00:02:19.680> just

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
an overstock of these they're just

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.950 
an overstock of these they're just
looking<00:02:20.010> to<00:02:20.250> get<00:02:20.370> rid<00:02:20.580> of<00:02:20.640> them<00:02:20.820> and<00:02:21.060> they

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
looking to get rid of them and they

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.680 
looking to get rid of them and they
threw<00:02:22.260> in<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.800> figure<00:02:23.190> to<00:02:23.580> increase<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:24.480> cost

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
threw in the figure to increase the cost

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.530 
threw in the figure to increase the cost
of<00:02:24.960> the<00:02:25.020> boxes<00:02:25.560> like<00:02:26.490> I<00:02:26.610> said<00:02:26.670> there<00:02:27.060> are<00:02:27.390> some

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
of the boxes like I said there are some

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.120 
of the boxes like I said there are some
figures<00:02:27.840> that<00:02:28.020> are<00:02:28.050> really<00:02:28.440> nice<00:02:28.650> out<00:02:28.950> there

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
figures that are really nice out there

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.550 
figures that are really nice out there
but<00:02:29.460> this<00:02:29.910> I<00:02:30.240> really<00:02:30.840> don't<00:02:31.050> think<00:02:31.110> is<00:02:31.380> one<00:02:31.530> of

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
but this I really don't think is one of

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.510 
but this I really don't think is one of
them<00:02:31.740> it's<00:02:31.980> half<00:02:32.760> a<00:02:32.910> figure<00:02:33.270> and<00:02:33.590> they<00:02:34.590> you

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
them it's half a figure and they you

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.390 
them it's half a figure and they you
know<00:02:35.630> even<00:02:36.630> retail<00:02:37.200> packs<00:02:37.710> or<00:02:37.950> four<00:02:38.190> bucks

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
know even retail packs or four bucks

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.210 
know even retail packs or four bucks
each<00:02:38.610> so<00:02:39.060> you<00:02:39.570> through<00:02:39.990> on<00:02:40.230> this<00:02:41.010> is

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
each so you through on this is

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.160 
each so you through on this is
essentially<00:02:41.790> saying<00:02:41.970> this<00:02:42.270> this<00:02:42.720> figure<00:02:43.140> is

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
essentially saying this this figure is

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.830 
essentially saying this this figure is
worth<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.740> booster<00:02:44.160> pack<00:02:44.370> I'm<00:02:44.880> sorry<00:02:45.420> I<00:02:45.510> don't

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
worth the booster pack I'm sorry I don't

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.340 
worth the booster pack I'm sorry I don't
see<00:02:46.140> that<00:02:46.170> that<00:02:46.590> figuring<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.460> from<00:02:49.190> yeah<00:02:50.190> um

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
see that that figuring the from yeah um

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.780 
see that that figuring the from yeah um
like<00:02:52.350> I<00:02:52.440> said<00:02:52.470> I<00:02:52.680> wish<00:02:52.740> the<00:02:53.070> Pokemon<00:02:53.460> were<00:02:53.580> just

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
like I said I wish the Pokemon were just

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.790 
like I said I wish the Pokemon were just
keep<00:02:54.000> things<00:02:54.240> separate<00:02:54.630> if<00:02:54.810> I<00:02:54.930> wanted<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:55.530> toy

I<00:02:56.100> could<00:02:56.430> go<00:02:56.550> buy<00:02:56.820> the<00:02:56.880> toys<00:02:57.390> separately<00:02:58.460> I

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
I could go buy the toys separately I

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.590 
I could go buy the toys separately I
want<00:03:00.690> the<00:03:00.840> cards<00:03:01.290> let<00:03:01.830> me<00:03:01.950> buy<00:03:02.070> the<00:03:02.130> cars<00:03:02.600> but

want the cards let me buy the cars but
either<00:03:03.780> way<00:03:04.050> so<00:03:04.560> if<00:03:04.620> you<00:03:04.680> haven't<00:03:04.830> figured<00:03:05.010> it

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
either way so if you haven't figured it

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.660 
either way so if you haven't figured it
out<00:03:05.340> that<00:03:05.670> ground<00:03:06.360> on<00:03:06.540> is<00:03:06.780> available<00:03:07.380> I<00:03:07.670> really

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
the good packs and I do have my reverse

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.220 
the good packs and I do have my reverse
set<00:04:20.220> list<00:04:20.640> pulled<00:04:21.239> out<00:04:21.510> let<00:04:21.660> me<00:04:21.720> just<00:04:21.960> scroll

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.230 
set list pulled out let me just scroll

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:23.570 
set list pulled out let me just scroll
down<00:04:22.290> a<00:04:22.500> little<00:04:22.590> bit<00:04:22.830> so<00:04:23.010> I<00:04:23.040> can<00:04:23.070> see<00:04:23.460> the

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
down a little bit so I can see the

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.400 
down a little bit so I can see the
entire<00:04:23.700> thing

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:27.840 

then<00:04:26.500> if<00:04:26.680> we're<00:04:26.860> lucky<00:04:27.040> we<00:04:27.280> might<00:04:27.310> pull<00:04:27.700> a

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
then if we're lucky we might pull a

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.910 
then if we're lucky we might pull a
reverse<00:04:28.300> that<00:04:28.510> when<00:04:28.660> you<00:04:28.720> need<00:04:28.900> to<00:04:30.870> Phoebus
