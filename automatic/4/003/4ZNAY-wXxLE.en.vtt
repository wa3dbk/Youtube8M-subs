interesting<00:01:22.409> is<00:01:22.619> that<00:01:22.939> the<00:01:23.939> faceplate<00:01:24.479> is

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
interesting is that the faceplate is

that they'd they'd release more overtime

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.880 
that they'd they'd release more overtime
I<00:01:36.390> mean<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.840> would<00:01:36.990> like<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.170> see<00:01:37.380> other<00:01:37.560> colors

that's<00:01:54.090> just<00:01:54.299> me<00:01:54.509> I<00:01:54.720> don't<00:01:55.320> it's<00:01:55.590> just

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
that's just me I don't it's just

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.340 
that's just me I don't it's just
probably<00:01:56.610> me<00:01:57.119> I<00:01:57.149> wouldn't<00:01:57.719> be<00:01:57.780> surprised<00:01:58.140> if

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
probably me I wouldn't be surprised if

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.899 
probably me I wouldn't be surprised if
it's<00:01:58.500> just<00:01:58.950> me<00:01:59.009> I<00:01:59.340> mean<00:01:59.610> just<00:01:59.640> about

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
it's just me I mean just about

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.969 
it's just me I mean just about
everything<00:02:00.180> on<00:02:00.450> my<00:02:00.570> desk<00:02:00.780> here<00:02:00.869> is<00:02:01.290> black

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
everything on my desk here is black

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.520 
everything on my desk here is black
white<00:02:02.579> or<00:02:03.030> silver<00:02:03.810> there's<00:02:04.079> really<00:02:04.170> not<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.439> lot

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
white or silver there's really not a lot

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.449 
white or silver there's really not a lot
of<00:02:04.649> color<00:02:05.040> here<00:02:05.610> so<00:02:05.880> when<00:02:06.869> I<00:02:07.079> set<00:02:07.560> this<00:02:07.890> up<00:02:08.069> I

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
of color here so when I set this up I

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.520 
of color here so when I set this up I
just<00:02:09.300> use<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.599> whites<00:02:09.750> of<00:02:09.899> face<00:02:10.110> plate<00:02:10.379> it

just use the whites of face plate it
just<00:02:10.649> popped<00:02:10.830> off<00:02:11.039> and

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
just popped off and

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
with a red one a fixed and I just popped

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.670 
with a red one a fixed and I just popped
it<00:02:17.330> off<00:02:17.450> put<00:02:17.840> on<00:02:17.930> the<00:02:18.020> white<00:02:18.110> one<00:02:18.320> then<00:02:18.500> I<00:02:18.560> was

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680

it off put on the white one then I was
good<00:02:18.830> to<00:02:18.920> go<00:02:19.010> of<00:02:19.220> course<00:02:19.730> it<00:02:19.880> has<00:02:20.030> a<00:02:20.330> built-in

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
good to go of course it has a built-in

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.830 
good to go of course it has a built-in
microphone<00:02:21.500> it<00:02:22.250> has<00:02:22.520> the<00:02:23.060> sensor<00:02:23.540> that<00:02:23.780> can

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
microphone it has the sensor that can

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.370 
microphone it has the sensor that can
capture<00:02:24.200> up<00:02:24.920> to<00:02:24.980> 1.3<00:02:25.820> megapixel<00:02:26.570> images<00:02:27.020> of

capture up to 1.3 megapixel images of
course<00:02:27.530> it<00:02:27.710> will<00:02:27.890> do<00:02:28.070> video<00:02:28.370> it's<00:02:28.640> got<00:02:28.790> the

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
course it will do video it's got the

button that will let you easily place
calls<00:02:30.680> so<00:02:30.890> long<00:02:31.040> as<00:02:31.160> you're<00:02:31.280> using<00:02:31.400> the

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
calls so long as you're using the

windows<00:02:32.150> live<00:02:32.300> messenger<00:02:33.130> however<00:02:34.130> i<00:02:34.400> think

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.460 
windows live messenger however i think

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.180 
windows live messenger however i think
more<00:02:35.210> interesting<00:02:35.720> to<00:02:35.900> me<00:02:36.050> is<00:02:36.290> the<00:02:36.380> compact

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
more interesting to me is the compact

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.840 
more interesting to me is the compact
nature<00:02:37.610> of<00:02:37.880> this<00:02:38.720> particular<00:02:38.990> model<00:02:39.530> in<00:02:39.850> so

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
nature of this particular model in so

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.199 
nature of this particular model in so
far<00:02:41.150> as<00:02:41.390> you<00:02:41.990> can<00:02:42.200> twist<00:02:42.680> it<00:02:42.860> around<00:02:42.950> and<00:02:43.459> also

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
far as you can twist it around and also

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.260 
far as you can twist it around and also
push<00:02:44.690> it<00:02:44.840> down<00:02:44.990> upon<00:02:45.650> itself<00:02:45.950> so<00:02:46.340> it's<00:02:47.090> very

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
push it down upon itself so it's very

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.410 
push it down upon itself so it's very
thin<00:02:47.690> so<00:02:48.590> when<00:02:48.740> you're<00:02:48.860> traveling<00:02:49.370> it's<00:02:50.209> then

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
thin so when you're traveling it's then

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.030 
thin so when you're traveling it's then
of<00:02:50.959> course<00:02:51.200> then<00:02:51.380> you<00:02:51.470> still<00:02:51.680> have<00:02:51.770> to<00:02:51.860> kind<00:02:52.010> of

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
of course then you still have to kind of

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.530 
of course then you still have to kind of
wrap<00:02:52.220> the<00:02:52.400> cable<00:02:52.610> around<00:02:53.000> and<00:02:53.239> around<00:02:53.330> and

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
wrap the cable around and around and

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.940 
wrap the cable around and around and
around<00:02:53.630> or<00:02:53.989> you<00:02:54.110> know<00:02:54.170> tie<00:02:54.380> it<00:02:54.440> in<00:02:54.620> some<00:02:54.830> other

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
around or you know tie it in some other

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.220 
around or you know tie it in some other
way<00:02:55.130> but<00:02:55.310> the<00:02:55.370> fact<00:02:55.580> that<00:02:55.820> the<00:02:56.209> profile<00:02:56.750> when

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
way but the fact that the profile when

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.190 
way but the fact that the profile when
collapsed<00:02:57.920> is<00:02:58.010> a<00:02:58.250> rather<00:02:58.700> skinny<00:02:59.120> makes<00:03:00.050> it

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
collapsed is a rather skinny makes it

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.170 
collapsed is a rather skinny makes it
really<00:03:00.410> suitable<00:03:00.800> for<00:03:01.190> for<00:03:01.489> moving<00:03:01.760> around<00:03:01.970> if

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
really suitable for for moving around if

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.840 
really suitable for for moving around if
that's<00:03:02.390> something<00:03:02.720> that<00:03:02.840> you<00:03:03.050> do<00:03:03.170> it<00:03:04.070> sits<00:03:04.520> on

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
that's something that you do it sits on

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.250 
that's something that you do it sits on
the<00:03:05.270> backup<00:03:05.630> and<00:03:05.750> this<00:03:05.840> is<00:03:05.930> something<00:03:06.170> you

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
the backup and this is something you

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.680 
the backup and this is something you
have<00:03:06.350> to<00:03:06.410> watch<00:03:06.590> for<00:03:06.890> with<00:03:07.430> with<00:03:07.940> webcams<00:03:08.420> of

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
have to watch for with with webcams of

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.570 
have to watch for with with webcams of
any<00:03:08.930> variety<00:03:09.850> something<00:03:10.850> that<00:03:11.090> allows<00:03:11.750> it<00:03:12.140> to

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
any variety something that allows it to

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.000 
any variety something that allows it to
sit<00:03:13.580> on<00:03:13.790> the<00:03:14.090> top<00:03:14.330> of<00:03:14.540> a<00:03:14.750> screen<00:03:15.110> so<00:03:15.410> I<00:03:15.620> could

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
sit on the top of a screen so I could

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.479 
sit on the top of a screen so I could
position<00:03:16.250> it<00:03:16.489> here<00:03:17.590> there<00:03:18.590> you<00:03:18.709> go<00:03:18.830> okay<00:03:19.220> easy

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
position it here there you go okay easy

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.030 
position it here there you go okay easy
and<00:03:19.850> I<00:03:19.910> can<00:03:20.060> tilt<00:03:20.299> it<00:03:20.390> down<00:03:20.450> and<00:03:21.350> I<00:03:21.769> can<00:03:21.920> move

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
and I can tilt it down and I can move

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.770 
and I can tilt it down and I can move
over<00:03:22.340> it<00:03:22.430> around<00:03:22.700> or<00:03:23.000> i<00:03:23.030> can<00:03:23.180> sit<00:03:23.510> it<00:03:23.600> on<00:03:23.660> the

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
over it around or i can sit it on the

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.870 
over it around or i can sit it on the
back<00:03:23.930> as<00:03:24.170> i<00:03:24.560> have<00:03:24.799> here<00:03:25.130> I've<00:03:25.250> got<00:03:25.280> a<00:03:25.430> logitech

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
back as i have here I've got a logitech

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.170 
back as i have here I've got a logitech
webcam<00:03:26.140> that's<00:03:27.310> on<00:03:28.310> the<00:03:28.640> top<00:03:28.820> of<00:03:29.060> this

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
webcam that's on the top of this

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.229 
webcam that's on the top of this
particular<00:03:29.390> monitor<00:03:30.549> some<00:03:31.549> webcams<00:03:32.000> don't

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
particular monitor some webcams don't

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.000 
particular monitor some webcams don't
have<00:03:32.390> that<00:03:32.600> and<00:03:32.840> so<00:03:33.440> it's<00:03:33.560> an<00:03:33.650> all<00:03:33.799> in<00:03:33.980> one

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
have that and so it's an all in one

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.430 
have that and so it's an all in one
piece<00:03:34.400> I<00:03:34.700> mean<00:03:35.000> the<00:03:35.150> the<00:03:35.540> USB<00:03:35.900> cable<00:03:35.930> does<00:03:36.320> not

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.810 
piece I mean the the USB cable does not
detach<00:03:36.769> there's<00:03:37.160> no<00:03:37.280> chance<00:03:37.459> of<00:03:37.610> you<00:03:37.670> losing
