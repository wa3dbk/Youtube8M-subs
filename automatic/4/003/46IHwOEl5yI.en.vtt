00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:22.310 

alright<00:03:20.459> so<00:03:20.610> I<00:03:20.670> went<00:03:20.820> arrow<00:03:21.060> bomb<00:03:21.330> very<00:03:22.080> first

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
alright so I went arrow bomb very first

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.520 
alright so I went arrow bomb very first
very<00:03:22.620> fast<00:03:22.920> and<00:03:23.690> then<00:03:24.690> I'm<00:03:24.989> actually<00:03:25.200> going<00:03:25.440> to

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
very fast and then I'm actually going to

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.770 
very fast and then I'm actually going to
go<00:03:25.560> straight<00:03:26.040> for<00:03:26.280> soul<00:03:26.519> arrow<00:03:26.730> because<00:03:27.570> it

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
go straight for soul arrow because it

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.740 
go straight for soul arrow because it
saves<00:03:28.050> you<00:03:28.290> arrows<00:03:29.390> enables<00:03:30.390> you<00:03:30.450> use<00:03:30.630> your

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
saves you arrows enables you use your

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.570 
saves you arrows enables you use your
bows<00:03:30.930> without<00:03:31.350> consuming<00:03:31.800> arrows<00:03:32.400> for<00:03:32.550> a

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
bows without consuming arrows for a

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.180 
bows without consuming arrows for a
fixed<00:03:32.850> period<00:03:32.880> of<00:03:33.150> time<00:03:33.500> so<00:03:34.500> we<00:03:34.920> need<00:03:35.130> level<00:03:35.640> 5

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
fixed period of time so we need level 5

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.900 
fixed period of time so we need level 5
you<00:03:38.190> know<00:03:38.310> level<00:03:38.700> 5<00:03:38.910> boat<00:03:39.180> booster<00:03:40.730> so<00:03:41.730> I<00:03:41.790> guess

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
you know level 5 boat booster so I guess

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:49.250 
you know level 5 boat booster so I guess
I<00:03:42.120> got<00:03:42.269> to<00:03:42.299> create<00:03:42.720> my<00:03:42.840> first<00:03:43.080> macro<00:03:47.480> um<00:03:48.480> where
