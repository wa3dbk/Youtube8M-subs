 hello beautiful welcome to the channel 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.610
 today I bring you this makeup 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:24.130
 which is a smoked eye for the newspaper 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:26.650
 It is very easy to do the only thing that 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:31.509
 occupy these three shades 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:34.840
 this is the one and the boarding of mac and 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:37.930
 this smile that is the prep and make up 

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.910
 cake and is preliminary solitaire the bone 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:43.000
 of the hackers the cream only go to 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:45.579
 need these three areas that can 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.230
 have very similar ones in your house and 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:49.690
 that's all I hope you like this 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.760
 tutorial is very simple I send you a 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.760
 kiss please do not forget to subscribe 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:58.150
 which make up their social networks 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:00.130
 by for this look and previously apply 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:03.370
 a pre base of shadows for me 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:05.229
 last longer and be the vibrant ones 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.880
 shadows right now I'm taking this 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:09.009
 shade that they want to make the cream 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:13.689
 but they can take any shade that 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:15.010
 it is of color bone or of color rosita very 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:18.490
 Clear 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:21.300
 this is that it is not white so that it does not 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:25.000
 see so vibrant and especially that it 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.350
 go out of the skin the color and 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.350
 then we have to find the 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:33.370
 average hue that is not so vibrant 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:36.429
 and that it serves as a transition and as 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:39.020
 lighting in the eyebrow bone 

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:45.619
 the second shadow I'm taking is 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:48.740
 is amber that is a reddish brown and what 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:52.249
 I will use to blur it in the 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:56.299
 external part of the eyelid and I'm going to 

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:58.480
 upload it through the eye socket I'm going to 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:02.400
 go blurring 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.400
 in circular movements 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.700
 and that's going to give us a little more 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.700
 depth 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.460
 to see how far we want our 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.280
 smoked 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:18.880
 and the only thing after finishing fogging 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:22.920
 little by little so that the color goes up 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.920
 as far as we 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:57.080
 as next step then it is to apply 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.269
 this shadow is called prep and that is 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.610
 of make up click we can mix it if 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:04.099
 they want with a little tiramisu to 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:07.700
 grab more intensity and take the 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:10.690
 exit from a little darker here is 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.690
 this shadow 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.240
 and that shadow we're going to put in the 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:22.870
 eyelid mobile as our color of 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:26.020
 center if we want to give dimension to the eye 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:28.270
 this shadow for one formed is 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.790
 perfect not to shrink too much 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:33.769
 eye 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:37.319
 nothing else gives a very light smoke without 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:40.890
 make our eyes very dark like 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:44.549
 to create is perfect and if you want if 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:47.340
 they have much bigger eyes 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:50.239
 they want to minimize we can occupy more than 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.239
 the brown shadow 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.950
 in more quantity the coffee zone and that we 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.210
 will darken the eye more and it will not 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:00.300
 make smaller 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:03.330
 and then with a black eyeliner 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:06.270
 of this is the beige tour against water 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:08.220
 and they can also occupy the visu I'm going to 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.320
 make a wing 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:14.240
 and little by little I'm going to blur it 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.240
 with the rubber tip 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:36.639
 I'm going to push the tabs away from applying 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:39.310
 possibly mask 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:42.520
 apply some false eyelashes in the 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:46.090
 external part or outside 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:48.400
 of the eye to raise a little more the 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.760
 look but that's all I'm going to put of 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.460
 the geopolitical individual 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.170
 I'm applying the vissum mask that 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:58.410
 is against water I really liked 

00:04:55.170 --> 00:05:01.180
 much the base brush for the eyelashes 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:06.060
 does not get stuck 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:06.060
 throughout the day and was made against 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:15.220
 I'm going to put the same shadow in amber in 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:17.500
 the lower part of the eye to delineate 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:20.140
 the lower lashes and nothing else the 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:23.530
 I'm going to compact and pull a little 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:25.100
 down the compact and the bass a 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.020
 little bit 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.820
 that as a last step you can add 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:31.340
 mascara on the bottom 

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:34.420
 and superior especially in the false 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.420
 that I put in the end 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:45.850
 and then this is the end in the eyes that 

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:47.620
 it's something simple for the newspaper is a 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:50.770
 almost always we want to take us 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:53.440
 uniformed to work to school and 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:56.260
 we really do not find the way to 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:59.350
 love it and that it does not look dark that if we 

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:01.990
 It is very annoying the eye or fall good 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:05.449
 Well, this is the look, I recommend you 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:09.770
 almost always seal it with 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:12.020
 it's like a makeup fixer 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:15.780
 so that the shadows also fall 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:18.090
 and I will give them all day 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:21.970
 to the mouth 

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:25.780
 use the for the mouth use this 

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:28.000
 lipstick that is the vintage of anastasias 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:31.180
 of the new lipsticks 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:34.210
 Long lasting lip gloss are shine 

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:37.330
 milestones are not mate this color I like 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:40.390
 a lot because it 's like very inside the 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:43.040
 range actually is in the range of 

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:48.020
 examples of knots 

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:49.820
 and it's that this is the wind that I feel 

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:53.900
 that we do well with brunettes are the 

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:59.000
 three lines this color and on the cheeks 

00:06:53.900 --> 00:07:02.120
 apply this which is the ranking of makeup 

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.950
 kick and nothing I put it very lightly and 

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:06.860
 Well that's all beautiful I hope that you 

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:08.210
