shoes<00:03:12.450> I<00:03:12.660> tried<00:03:12.900> them<00:03:13.080> they<00:03:13.140> were<00:03:13.440> they<00:03:13.980> were

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
shoes I tried them they were they were

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.280 
shoes I tried them they were they were
stiff<00:03:14.430> they<00:03:14.640> were<00:03:14.700> bulky<00:03:15.180> they<00:03:15.390> just<00:03:15.630> had<00:03:16.260> no

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
stiff they were bulky they just had no

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.770 
stiff they were bulky they just had no
feel<00:03:16.800> these<00:03:17.489> are<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:17.850> complete<00:03:18.180> opposite

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
feel these are the complete opposite

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.600 
feel these are the complete opposite
these<00:03:19.230> fit<00:03:19.620> like<00:03:19.950> a<00:03:20.190> van<00:03:20.550> slip-on<00:03:21.620> and<00:03:22.620> work

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
these fit like a van slip-on and work

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.050 
these fit like a van slip-on and work
extremely<00:03:24.000> well<00:03:24.300> so<00:03:25.290> I<00:03:25.760> guess<00:03:26.760> that's<00:03:26.940> pretty

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
extremely well so I guess that's pretty

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.750 
extremely well so I guess that's pretty
much<00:03:27.330> it<00:03:27.570> I<00:03:27.860> would<00:03:28.860> highly<00:03:29.010> recommend<00:03:29.190> these

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
much it I would highly recommend these

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.660 
much it I would highly recommend these
and<00:03:30.030> maybe<00:03:30.840> like<00:03:31.260> in<00:03:31.980> a<00:03:32.100> month<00:03:32.280> or<00:03:32.370> two<00:03:32.430> is

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
and maybe like in a month or two is

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.340 
and maybe like in a month or two is
skating<00:03:32.880> them<00:03:33.150> if<00:03:33.300> they're<00:03:33.930> still<00:03:34.140> together

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
skating them if they're still together

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.740 
skating them if they're still together
in<00:03:34.709> one<00:03:34.860> piece<00:03:35.100> I'll<00:03:35.700> show<00:03:35.910> you<00:03:35.970> that<00:03:36.180> and<00:03:36.600> we

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
in one piece I'll show you that and we

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.970 
in one piece I'll show you that and we
see<00:03:36.930> how<00:03:37.050> they<00:03:37.170> hold<00:03:37.290> up<00:03:37.470> I<00:03:37.739> guess<00:03:38.700> that's<00:03:38.880> it
