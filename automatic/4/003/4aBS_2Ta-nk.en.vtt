and I feel since my sky miles are not

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.530 
and I feel since my sky miles are not
worth<00:00:31.079> as<00:00:31.320> much<00:00:31.349> as<00:00:31.800> my<00:00:32.070> American<00:00:33.000> Airlines

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540

worth as much as my American Airlines
miles<00:00:33.900> that<00:00:34.620> I<00:00:34.739> should<00:00:35.010> probably<00:00:35.280> go<00:00:35.910> ahead

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
cancel my sky miles card so that I can

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.020

been in the same exact situation as you

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.000 
been in the same exact situation as you
i<00:01:00.390> used<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.810> live<00:01:00.930> in<00:01:00.960> new<00:01:01.140> york<00:01:01.170> with<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.740> delta

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
i used to live in new york with a delta

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.070 
i used to live in new york with a delta
diamond<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:02.910> then<00:01:03.000> I<00:01:03.090> moved<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.390> Miami<00:01:03.750> and

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
diamond and then I moved to Miami and

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.710 
diamond and then I moved to Miami and
realized<00:01:05.009> that<00:01:05.129> while<00:01:05.460> flying<00:01:05.820> Delta<00:01:06.240> in<00:01:06.540> and

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
realized that while flying Delta in and

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.669 
realized that while flying Delta in and
out<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:06.869> Miami<00:01:07.109> is<00:01:07.259> actually<00:01:07.499> pretty

00:01:07.669 --> 00:01:07.679 
out of Miami is actually pretty

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:09.410 
out of Miami is actually pretty
convenient<00:01:08.039> because<00:01:08.310> you<00:01:08.460> always<00:01:08.759> land<00:01:08.999> close

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
convenient because you always land close

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.690 
convenient because you always land close
to<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:10.109> exit<00:01:10.409> of<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.649> terminal<00:01:11.100> it's<00:01:11.429> a<00:01:11.490> lot

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
to the exit of the terminal it's a lot

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.480 
to the exit of the terminal it's a lot
less<00:01:11.850> crowded<00:01:12.390> than<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.570> American<00:01:12.960> terminal

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
less crowded than the American terminal

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.859 
less crowded than the American terminal
your<00:01:14.490> options<00:01:14.999> especially<00:01:15.179> when<00:01:15.509> redeeming

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
your options especially when redeeming

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.529 
your options especially when redeeming
miles<00:01:16.079> are<00:01:16.350> much<00:01:16.770> more<00:01:17.340> limited<00:01:17.909> so<00:01:18.270> with<00:01:18.420> your

00:01:18.529 --> 00:01:18.539 
miles are much more limited so with your

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:19.669 
miles are much more limited so with your
hundred<00:01:18.840> thousand<00:01:19.200> miles

00:01:19.669 --> 00:01:19.679 
hundred thousand miles

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:21.980 
hundred thousand miles
now<00:01:20.130> with<00:01:20.310> Delta's<00:01:20.670> increases<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:21.719> know<00:01:21.749> the

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
now with Delta's increases you know the

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.389 
now with Delta's increases you know the
the<00:01:22.229> base<00:01:22.409> level<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.799> get<00:01:22.920> business-class

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:23.399 
the base level to get business-class

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:26.899 
the base level to get business-class
round-trip<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:23.999> Europe's<00:01:25.039> 125,000<00:01:26.039> so<00:01:26.219> what<00:01:26.880> I

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
round-trip to Europe's 125,000 so what I

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.370 
round-trip to Europe's 125,000 so what I
would<00:01:27.090> recommend<00:01:27.210> is<00:01:27.600> probably<00:01:27.899> getting<00:01:28.140> up

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
would recommend is probably getting up

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.719 
would recommend is probably getting up
to<00:01:28.499> that<00:01:28.649> level<00:01:28.859> and<00:01:29.130> trying<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.429> book<00:01:29.609> a

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
to that level and trying to book a

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.429 
to that level and trying to book a
Virgin<00:01:30.030> Atlantic<00:01:30.450> flight<00:01:30.479> or<00:01:30.929> trying<00:01:31.319> to<00:01:31.350> get

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
Virgin Atlantic flight or trying to get

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.889 
Virgin Atlantic flight or trying to get
any<00:01:31.679> partner<00:01:32.159> flight<00:01:32.460> out<00:01:32.700> of<00:01:32.729> Miami<00:01:33.179> to<00:01:33.569> avoid

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:33.899 
any partner flight out of Miami to avoid

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:35.719 
any partner flight out of Miami to avoid
Delta<00:01:34.380> because<00:01:35.130> if<00:01:35.249> you<00:01:35.340> can<00:01:35.460> book<00:01:35.609> on

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
Delta because if you can book on

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.700 
Delta because if you can book on
partners<00:01:36.149> you'll<00:01:36.600> lock<00:01:36.960> in<00:01:37.229> at<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.439> saver

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
partners you'll lock in at the saver

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.529 
partners you'll lock in at the saver
rate<00:01:38.189> I<00:01:38.429> would<00:01:38.700> definitely<00:01:39.359> recommend

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:39.539 
rate I would definitely recommend

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:41.989 
rate I would definitely recommend
switching<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.770> American<00:01:41.520> if<00:01:41.639> you<00:01:41.729> want

00:01:41.989 --> 00:01:41.999 
switching to American if you want

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:45.230 
switching to American if you want
valuable<00:01:42.600> miles<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.200> lots<00:01:43.499> of<00:01:43.649> options<00:01:44.240> when

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
valuable miles and lots of options when

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.069 
valuable miles and lots of options when
living<00:01:45.509> in<00:01:45.569> Miami

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
living in Miami

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.389 
living in Miami
I<00:01:46.200> know<00:01:46.319> Delta<00:01:46.649> was<00:01:46.770> making<00:01:47.069> a<00:01:47.159> play<00:01:47.280> from

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
I know Delta was making a play from

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.370 
I know Delta was making a play from
Miami<00:01:47.850> for<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.179> while<00:01:48.299> with<00:01:48.539> the<00:01:48.569> Miami<00:01:48.899> London

flight they had a couple different la
Miami<00:01:51.659> flights<00:01:52.020> but<00:01:52.259> that's<00:01:52.530> really<00:01:52.770> pared

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:53.219 
Miami flights but that's really pared

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:54.709 
Miami flights but that's really pared
down<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.759> American<00:01:54.179> is<00:01:54.270> still<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.539> dominant
