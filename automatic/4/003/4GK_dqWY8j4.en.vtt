00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.650
 Hello 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.309
 On the site of the race tasteful recipe spat 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.840
 I see on the site 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.540
 unusually tasty Turkish sweetness 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.550
 on the bank and yogurt what is today 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:23.920
 try as far as sex 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.869
 and in this video I will show you how 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:29.189
 pour eggs with sugar for 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:32.680
 making the same mourning 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:35.050
 very often baking recipes we see 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.149
 what you need to beat eggs with sugar 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.020
 so how to do it right 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:43.480
 first eggs must be cold 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:46.950
 separate the yolk from the protein and so far 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.950
 beat only Berkeley 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.440
 so that the proteins beat well the capacity in 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.950
 which we will beat 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:09.869
 should be perfectly dry and whites 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.869
 there should be no vein 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.700
 Well 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:22.570
 by the way so that the protein can be broken 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.570
 add a pinch of salt 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:33.820
 when our hands increase immediately as when 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.450
 add sugar and continue to beat 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.450
 farther 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.090
 at the end we add our yolks and more 

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:43.090
 beat a bit 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:55.660
 what is ready our eggs are whipped 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:58.230
 all bon appetit and good 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:58.230
