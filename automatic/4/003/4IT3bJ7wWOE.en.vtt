00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:47.529 

half<00:01:32.820> way<00:01:33.119> along<00:01:33.270> now<00:01:38.959> very<00:01:39.959> little<00:01:40.110> added

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:47.539 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:57.219 

it's<00:01:48.539> beginning<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:48.959> do<00:01:51.530> planting<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.679> so<00:01:52.860> on

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.449 

its<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:58.979> okay<00:01:59.670> oh<00:01:59.970> nothing

00:02:01.449 --> 00:02:01.459 
its and okay oh nothing

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:04.600 
its and okay oh nothing
everything's<00:02:02.459> beginning<00:02:02.789> to<00:02:02.909> grow<00:02:03.119> as<00:02:03.330> I<00:02:03.420> said

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
everything's beginning to grow as I said

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:10.990 
everything's beginning to grow as I said
and<00:02:05.610> then<00:02:06.470> the<00:02:07.470> far<00:02:07.800> end<00:02:08.099> over<00:02:08.250> there<00:02:08.580> which<00:02:08.849> is

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
and then the far end over there which is

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.080 
and then the far end over there which is
only<00:02:12.000> really<00:02:12.390> recently<00:02:12.569> been<00:02:12.959> cultivated

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:23.460 

stunning<00:02:19.250> example

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.820 

and<00:02:23.860> then<00:02:24.100> looking<00:02:24.520> back<00:02:24.730> I<00:02:27.120> think<00:02:28.120> you<00:02:28.480> can

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
and then looking back I think you can

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.920 
and then looking back I think you can
appreciate<00:02:30.630> size<00:02:31.630> and<00:02:31.900> scale<00:02:32.110> all<00:02:32.350> relevant
