00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
I'm gonna do is I found a drill bit that

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.599 
I'm gonna do is I found a drill bit that
works<00:00:28.019> really<00:00:28.380> well<00:00:28.560> with<00:00:28.829> the<00:00:29.039> pins<00:00:29.429> I'm

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
works really well with the pins I'm

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.880 
works really well with the pins I'm
gonna<00:00:29.759> be<00:00:29.880> using<00:00:30.179> I<00:00:30.329> use<00:00:30.630> wire<00:00:30.839> nails<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.649> pin

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
gonna be using I use wire nails to pin

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.680 
gonna be using I use wire nails to pin
them<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.160> clip<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.520> heads<00:00:32.700> off<00:00:32.850> after<00:00:33.600> I'm

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690

done and so you just go everywhere you

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:46.560 
done and so you just go everywhere you
hot-glued<00:00:38.630> you're<00:00:39.630> gonna<00:00:39.780> just<00:00:41.780> hold<00:00:42.780> it

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.790 

you're<00:00:47.570> very<00:00:47.930> careful<00:00:48.080> are<00:00:48.380> you<00:00:48.440> doing<00:00:48.680> this

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
like this we start putting pins and as

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.280 
like this we start putting pins and as
soon<00:00:52.730> as<00:00:52.790> I<00:00:52.880> drill<00:00:53.120> my<00:00:53.270> first<00:00:53.510> Hall<00:00:56.200> once<00:00:57.200> you

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:57.290 
soon as I drill my first Hall once you

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:58.810 
soon as I drill my first Hall once you
start<00:00:57.470> drilling<00:00:57.620> the<00:00:57.770> holes<00:00:57.980> it<00:00:58.280> breaks<00:00:58.550> up

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
start drilling the holes it breaks up

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.200 
start drilling the holes it breaks up
the<00:00:58.850> hot<00:00:59.360> glue<00:00:59.840> and<00:01:00.460> you<00:01:01.460> lose<00:01:01.820> a<00:01:01.850> lot<00:01:01.940> of<00:01:02.090> your

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
the hot glue and you lose a lot of your

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.040 
the hot glue and you lose a lot of your
hold<00:01:02.530> so<00:01:03.530> I'm<00:01:03.590> gonna<00:01:03.770> do<00:01:03.950> is<00:01:04.160> I'm<00:01:04.670> going<00:01:04.850> to

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.050 
hold so I'm gonna do is I'm going to

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.180 
hold so I'm gonna do is I'm going to
instead<00:01:06.050> of<00:01:06.110> just<00:01:06.230> putting<00:01:06.410> the<00:01:06.590> pins<00:01:06.800> in<00:01:07.040> and

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
instead of just putting the pins in and

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.370 
instead of just putting the pins in and
hoping<00:01:07.490> it<00:01:07.640> hoping<00:01:08.570> they<00:01:08.720> stay<00:01:08.960> you<00:01:09.140> know<00:01:09.230> just

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
hoping it hoping they stay you know just

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
hoping it hoping they stay you know just
going<00:01:09.590> by<00:01:09.710> snug<00:01:10.010> fit

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
going by snug fit

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.880 
going by snug fit
I<00:01:10.430> put<00:01:11.000> crazy<00:01:11.330> glue<00:01:11.570> and<00:01:12.230> sort<00:01:12.530> of<00:01:12.560> superglue

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:12.890 
I put crazy glue and sort of superglue

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.070 
I put crazy glue and sort of superglue
on<00:01:13.040> there<00:01:15.940> to<00:01:16.940> help<00:01:17.060> make<00:01:17.270> sure<00:01:17.300> it<00:01:17.510> holds<00:01:17.660> for

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
on there to help make sure it holds for

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.290 
on there to help make sure it holds for
a<00:01:18.320> long<00:01:18.740> time<00:01:18.950> so<00:01:19.310> I'm<00:01:19.400> using<00:01:19.550> a<00:01:19.729> fine<00:01:19.970> point

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:20.300 
a long time so I'm using a fine point

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.859 
a long time so I'm using a fine point
applicator<00:01:20.780> here<00:01:21.760> I'm<00:01:22.760> just<00:01:22.940> I'm<00:01:23.150> putting<00:01:23.780> it

applicator here I'm just I'm putting it

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.000 
applicator here I'm just I'm putting it
into<00:01:24.260> the<00:01:24.530> hole<00:01:24.710> squeezing<00:01:25.310> it<00:01:25.400> into<00:01:25.640> the<00:01:25.880> hole

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.010 
into the hole squeezing it into the hole

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.850 
into the hole squeezing it into the hole
she's<00:01:28.010> getting<00:01:28.280> something<00:01:28.520> okay

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
I used a pretty big drill bit I'm

I used a pretty big drill bit I'm

to<00:01:54.570> a<00:01:54.660> little<00:01:54.870> bit<00:01:55.080> smaller<00:01:55.470> one<00:01:55.740> for<00:01:55.950> these

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
to a little bit smaller one for these

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
into that one see if I can get a good

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:29.630 
into that one see if I can get a good
camera<00:02:21.180> angle<00:02:21.480> on<00:02:21.750> this<00:02:28.190> once<00:02:29.190> you<00:02:29.280> get<00:02:29.430> your

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
camera angle on this once you get your

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:33.170 
camera angle on this once you get your
your<00:02:30.330> hole<00:02:30.570> here<00:02:31.280> this<00:02:32.280> one<00:02:32.520> is<00:02:32.700> just<00:02:32.850> going

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
your hole here this one is just going

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.840 
your hole here this one is just going
through<00:02:33.209> this<00:02:34.080> first<00:02:34.410> about<00:02:35.370> halfway<00:02:35.640> through

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
through this first about halfway through

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.390 
through this first about halfway through
the<00:02:36.150> second<00:02:36.510> one<00:02:36.540> here<00:02:37.100> then<00:02:38.100> I'm<00:02:38.160> going<00:02:38.310> to

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
the second one here then I'm going to

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.430 
the second one here then I'm going to
take<00:02:39.950> my<00:02:40.950> Krazy<00:02:41.310> Glue<00:02:41.520> here<00:02:42.140> this<00:02:43.140> with<00:02:43.410> a

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
take my Krazy Glue here this with a

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.890 
take my Krazy Glue here this with a
little<00:02:43.770> fine<00:02:44.040> point<00:02:44.310> applicator<00:02:44.900> start

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
little fine point applicator start

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.890 
little fine point applicator start
putting<00:02:46.260> crazy<00:02:46.920> glue<00:02:49.820> into<00:02:50.820> the<00:02:51.030> hole<00:02:51.209> as<00:02:51.630> much

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
putting crazy glue into the hole as much

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.320 
putting crazy glue into the hole as much
as<00:02:52.050> I<00:02:52.140> can<00:02:52.290> get<00:02:52.440> in<00:02:52.590> that<00:02:52.680> quick

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
as I can get in that quick

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.070 
as I can get in that quick
then<00:02:54.330> take<00:02:54.540> one<00:02:54.570> my<00:02:54.900> little<00:02:55.530> wire<00:02:55.680> nails<00:02:55.980> here

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
then take one my little wire nails here

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.020 
then take one my little wire nails here
just<00:02:58.080> push<00:02:58.260> it<00:02:58.440> in<00:02:58.560> it's<00:02:58.709> a<00:02:58.769> really<00:02:59.280> snug<00:02:59.670> fit

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
just push it in it's a really snug fit

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.330 
just push it in it's a really snug fit
here

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
here

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.229 
here
and<00:03:02.340> then<00:03:03.380> there<00:03:04.380> we<00:03:04.470> go<00:03:04.680> use<00:03:05.640> this<00:03:05.820> just<00:03:06.030> kind

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
and then there we go use this just kind

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:13.580 
and then there we go use this just kind
of<00:03:06.590> tap<00:03:07.590> it<00:03:07.799> in<00:03:07.920> a<00:03:08.130> little<00:03:08.519> ways<00:03:12.350> now<00:03:13.350> all<00:03:13.530> I

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
of tap it in a little ways now all I

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.350 
of tap it in a little ways now all I
have<00:03:13.680> to<00:03:13.769> do<00:03:13.860> is<00:03:13.980> clip<00:03:14.190> the<00:03:14.310> heads<00:03:14.519> off<00:03:14.700> my<00:03:15.090> pins

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
have to do is clip the heads off my pins

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.610 
have to do is clip the heads off my pins
I<00:03:16.350> think<00:03:16.890> I<00:03:16.980> have<00:03:17.540> six<00:03:18.540> or<00:03:18.690> seven<00:03:19.080> contact

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
I think I have six or seven contact

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.759 
I think I have six or seven contact
points<00:03:19.950> on<00:03:20.070> this<00:03:20.220> so<00:03:21.320> that's<00:03:22.320> always<00:03:22.530> been

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
points on this so that's always been

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.190 
points on this so that's always been
enough<00:03:23.010> in<00:03:23.130> the<00:03:23.220> past<00:03:23.430> as<00:03:23.760> long<00:03:23.790> as<00:03:24.120> you<00:03:25.080> have<00:03:25.170> a

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
enough in the past as long as you have a

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.500 
enough in the past as long as you have a
few<00:03:25.620> in<00:03:25.799> each<00:03:25.860> antler<00:03:26.310> it<00:03:26.940> should<00:03:27.239> be<00:03:27.330> pretty

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
few in each antler it should be pretty

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.330 
few in each antler it should be pretty
good<00:03:27.570> now<00:03:27.810> what<00:03:27.930> we<00:03:28.019> have<00:03:28.110> to<00:03:28.200> do<00:03:28.350> is<00:03:28.500> drill<00:03:28.769> our

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
good now what we have to do is drill our

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.550 
good now what we have to do is drill our
hole<00:03:29.519> for<00:03:29.850> the<00:03:30.269> steel<00:03:30.630> nipple<00:03:30.959> which<00:03:31.260> is<00:03:31.410> what

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
hole for the steel nipple which is what

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.770 
hole for the steel nipple which is what
you're<00:03:31.680> gonna<00:03:31.769> then<00:03:32.070> put<00:03:32.640> all<00:03:32.730> your<00:03:33.000> hardware

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
you're gonna then put all your hardware

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.940 
you're gonna then put all your hardware
on<00:03:33.989> top<00:03:34.260> of<00:03:35.750> you<00:03:36.750> just<00:03:36.959> find<00:03:37.140> a<00:03:37.260> drill<00:03:37.590> bit<00:03:37.769> and

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
on top of you just find a drill bit and

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.310 
on top of you just find a drill bit and
as<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.220> same<00:03:38.400> diameter<00:03:38.730> as<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.750> nipple<00:03:39.989> here

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
as the same diameter as the nipple here

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.920 
as the same diameter as the nipple here
and<00:03:40.760> never<00:03:41.760> start<00:03:42.060> with<00:03:42.180> a<00:03:42.239> small<00:03:42.510> little<00:03:42.840> bit

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
and never start with a small little bit

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:45.170 
and never start with a small little bit
first<00:03:43.200> and<00:03:43.380> then<00:03:43.530> work<00:03:43.680> your<00:03:43.799> way<00:03:43.950> up<00:03:44.180> it's

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
first and then work your way up it's

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.600 
first and then work your way up it's
hard<00:03:45.630> just<00:03:46.170> hard<00:03:46.860> to<00:03:46.950> get<00:03:47.070> it<00:03:47.190> to<00:03:47.280> line<00:03:47.459> up

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
hard just hard to get it to line up

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:49.640 
hard just hard to get it to line up
right<00:03:47.670> but<00:03:48.480> when<00:03:48.959> you<00:03:49.019> first<00:03:49.170> start<00:03:49.440> these

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
right but when you first start these

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.620 
right but when you first start these
because<00:03:50.070> you<00:03:50.190> never<00:03:50.370> can<00:03:50.670> you're<00:03:51.330> never<00:03:51.480> going

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
because you never can you're never going

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:52.759 
because you never can you're never going
to<00:03:51.660> have<00:03:51.810> one<00:03:51.959> that's<00:03:52.049> completely<00:03:52.260> flat

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
to have one that's completely flat

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.100 
to have one that's completely flat
completely<00:03:53.130> vertical<00:03:54.060> what<00:03:54.780> you<00:03:54.840> do<00:03:54.930> is<00:03:55.019> you

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
completely vertical what you do is you

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.780 
completely vertical what you do is you
start<00:03:55.260> out<00:03:55.410> drilling<00:03:56.190> by<00:03:56.760> going<00:03:57.000> straight<00:03:57.359> on

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
start out drilling by going straight on

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.580 
start out drilling by going straight on
once<00:03:59.790> you've<00:03:59.970> gone<00:04:00.150> in<00:04:00.390> a<00:04:00.660> little<00:04:01.200> bit<00:04:01.319> with

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
once you've gone in a little bit with

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.800 
once you've gone in a little bit with
that<00:04:04.940> then<00:04:05.940> you<00:04:06.120> can<00:04:06.239> start<00:04:06.450> doing<00:04:06.630> your

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
that then you can start doing your

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.479 
that then you can start doing your
downward<00:04:07.140> motion<00:04:07.560> you<00:04:07.860> have<00:04:07.950> to<00:04:08.040> go<00:04:08.160> in<00:04:08.340> more

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
downward motion you have to go in more

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.550 
downward motion you have to go in more
ways<00:04:08.670> three<00:04:09.209> straight<00:04:09.720> on<00:04:09.870> then<00:04:10.260> you<00:04:10.319> can<00:04:10.440> go

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
ways three straight on then you can go

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.020 
ways three straight on then you can go
straight<00:04:11.400> down<00:04:11.640> for<00:04:11.940> the<00:04:13.190> steel<00:04:14.190> so<00:04:14.730> I've<00:04:14.850> got

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
straight down for the steel so I've got

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.199 
straight down for the steel so I've got
my<00:04:15.270> hole<00:04:15.989> drilled<00:04:16.290> for<00:04:16.590> the<00:04:16.650> nipple<00:04:17.000> went<00:04:18.000> down

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
my hole drilled for the nipple went down

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.270 
my hole drilled for the nipple went down
actually<00:04:18.660> a<00:04:18.690> pretty<00:04:18.840> good<00:04:18.989> place<00:04:19.169> one<00:04:20.100> thing

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
actually a pretty good place one thing

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.340 
actually a pretty good place one thing
to<00:04:20.430> be<00:04:20.579> careful<00:04:20.940> of<00:04:21.150> if<00:04:21.299> you<00:04:21.389> buy<00:04:21.540> a<00:04:21.570> make<00:04:21.900> your

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
to be careful of if you buy a make your

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.230 
to be careful of if you buy a make your
own<00:04:22.470> lamp<00:04:22.680> kit<00:04:23.010> is<00:04:23.490> sometimes<00:04:23.820> the<00:04:24.000> nipples

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
own lamp kit is sometimes the nipples

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.750 
own lamp kit is sometimes the nipples
are<00:04:24.360> really<00:04:24.750> short<00:04:25.020> so<00:04:25.470> I<00:04:25.800> actually<00:04:26.310> I<00:04:26.700> just

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
are really short so I actually I just

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.030 
are really short so I actually I just
buy<00:04:27.000> another<00:04:27.480> pack<00:04:27.870> of<00:04:28.080> them<00:04:28.139> to<00:04:28.710> get<00:04:28.830> longer

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
buy another pack of them to get longer

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.850 
buy another pack of them to get longer
ones<00:04:29.310> I<00:04:29.580> always<00:04:29.850> prefer<00:04:30.210> longer<00:04:30.620> if<00:04:31.620> you<00:04:31.710> don't
