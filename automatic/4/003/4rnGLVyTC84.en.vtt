I'm a biology teacher I'm always asking

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.000 
I'm a biology teacher I'm always asking
myself<00:00:17.400> how<00:00:18.210> can<00:00:18.270> I<00:00:18.510> use<00:00:18.779> these<00:00:18.990> gadgets<00:00:19.320> to

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
myself how can I use these gadgets to

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.609 
myself how can I use these gadgets to
teach<00:00:20.189> biology<00:00:20.660> after<00:00:21.660> all<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:22.109> lot<00:00:22.470> of<00:00:22.560> my

teach biology after all a lot of my

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.590 
teach biology after all a lot of my
students<00:00:23.010> are<00:00:23.070> into<00:00:23.340> technology<00:00:23.420> it's<00:00:24.420> what

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
students are into technology it's what

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.390 
students are into technology it's what
they're<00:00:24.779> doing<00:00:25.050> every<00:00:25.260> day<00:00:25.289> so<00:00:26.039> how<00:00:26.160> can<00:00:26.220> I

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
they're doing every day so how can I

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.820 
they're doing every day so how can I
take<00:00:26.609> advantage<00:00:27.029> of<00:00:27.150> that<00:00:27.330> for<00:00:28.260> example<00:00:28.680> about

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
take advantage of that for example about

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.099 
take advantage of that for example about
ten<00:00:29.099> years<00:00:29.279> ago<00:00:29.580> I<00:00:29.820> noticed<00:00:30.359> my<00:00:30.630> students<00:00:31.019> were

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
ten years ago I noticed my students were

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.590 
ten years ago I noticed my students were
all<00:00:31.170> come<00:00:31.410> into<00:00:31.529> class<00:00:31.800> wearing<00:00:32.640> iPods<00:00:33.270> but

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
all come into class wearing iPods but

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.930 
all come into class wearing iPods but
they<00:00:34.020> were<00:00:34.079> all<00:00:34.260> listening<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.890> mp3s<00:00:35.640> all<00:00:35.850> the

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
they were all listening to mp3s all the

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.900 
they were all listening to mp3s all the
time<00:00:36.120> so<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:36.899> asked<00:00:37.170> myself<00:00:37.290> hmmm<00:00:37.920> okay<00:00:38.280> how<00:00:38.850> can

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
time so I asked myself hmmm okay how can

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.709 
time so I asked myself hmmm okay how can
I<00:00:39.149> use<00:00:39.540> audio<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:41.040> help<00:00:41.190> teach<00:00:41.399> biology<00:00:41.690> so<00:00:42.690> I

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
I use audio to help teach biology so I

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.720 
I use audio to help teach biology so I
started<00:00:43.079> recording<00:00:43.260> my<00:00:43.649> lectures<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.190> making

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
started recording my lectures and making

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.790 
started recording my lectures and making
them<00:00:44.850> available<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.510> students<00:00:46.200> for<00:00:46.260> download

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
them available to students for download

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:47.990 
them available to students for download
so<00:00:46.829> that<00:00:47.070> they<00:00:47.160> could<00:00:47.280> listen<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.640> them<00:00:47.820> in<00:00:47.940> the

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
so that they could listen to them in the

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.049 
so that they could listen to them in the
car<00:00:48.239> or<00:00:48.510> while<00:00:48.660> they<00:00:48.809> exercise<00:00:49.640> more<00:00:50.640> recently

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
car or while they exercise more recently

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.090 
car or while they exercise more recently
I've<00:00:51.449> noticed<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.230> my<00:00:52.379> students<00:00:52.800> are<00:00:52.890> using

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
I've noticed that my students are using

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.029 
I've noticed that my students are using
their<00:00:53.399> cell<00:00:53.610> phones<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:54.449> watch<00:00:54.629> videos<00:00:55.110> this

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
their cell phones to watch videos this

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.029 
their cell phones to watch videos this
has<00:00:56.550> become<00:00:56.730> very<00:00:57.030> popular<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.949> whenever<00:00:58.949> I

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
has become very popular and whenever I

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.680 
has become very popular and whenever I
see<00:00:59.370> my<00:00:59.399> students<00:00:59.940> using<00:01:00.390> some<00:01:00.570> new

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
see my students using some new

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.170 
see my students using some new
technology<00:01:01.320> I<00:01:01.559> always<00:01:02.039> think<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.250> myself<00:01:02.340> hmmm

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
technology I always think to myself hmmm

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.350 
technology I always think to myself hmmm
how<00:01:03.899> can<00:01:04.110> I<00:01:04.229> use<00:01:04.830> surp<00:01:05.250> this<00:01:05.580> new<00:01:05.760> technology

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
how can I use surp this new technology

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.870 
how can I use surp this new technology
for<00:01:06.570> my<00:01:06.689> own<00:01:06.869> nefarious<00:01:07.830> purposes<00:01:08.310> namely

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
for my own nefarious purposes namely

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.109 
for my own nefarious purposes namely
teaching<00:01:09.600> biology<00:01:09.979> so<00:01:10.979> about<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.700> year<00:01:11.790> ago<00:01:11.939> I

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
teaching biology so about a year ago I

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.000 
teaching biology so about a year ago I
started<00:01:12.420> thinking<00:01:12.780> okay<00:01:12.840> how<00:01:13.530> can<00:01:13.590> I<00:01:13.799> use

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.260 
in a way that's exciting and interesting
to<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.960> students<00:01:58.549> since<00:01:59.549> I<00:01:59.700> didn't<00:01:59.939> find<00:02:00.060> any

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
to the students since I didn't find any

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.109 
to the students since I didn't find any
that<00:02:00.600> I<00:02:00.659> liked<00:02:00.990> I<00:02:01.350> set<00:02:01.829> out<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:01.979> create<00:02:02.130> my<00:02:02.909> own

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
that I liked I set out to create my own

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.959 
that I liked I set out to create my own
set<00:02:03.509> of<00:02:03.750> videos<00:02:04.500> that<00:02:05.219> really<00:02:05.610> take<00:02:05.820> advantage

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
set of videos that really take advantage

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.440 
set of videos that really take advantage
of<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:07.020> video<00:02:07.290> medium<00:02:07.940> so<00:02:08.940> I<00:02:08.970> tried<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.300> think

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
of the video medium so I tried to think

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.380 
of the video medium so I tried to think
of<00:02:09.629> what<00:02:10.050> topics<00:02:10.649> are<00:02:10.860> there<00:02:11.160> from<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.090> intro

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
of what topics are there from the intro

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.700 
of what topics are there from the intro
bio<00:02:12.569> curriculum<00:02:13.200> the

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
bio curriculum the

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.740 
bio curriculum the
students<00:02:14.070> really<00:02:14.310> struggle<00:02:14.820> with<00:02:14.940> that<00:02:15.540> can

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
students really struggle with that can

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.190 
students really struggle with that can
benefit<00:02:16.290> from<00:02:16.740> a<00:02:16.860> video<00:02:17.100> treatment<00:02:17.990> so<00:02:18.990> for

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
benefit from a video treatment so for

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.200 
benefit from a video treatment so for
example<00:02:19.620> in<00:02:19.740> our<00:02:19.830> first<00:02:20.070> set<00:02:20.310> of<00:02:20.340> video<00:02:20.790> tutor

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
example in our first set of video tutor

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.770 
example in our first set of video tutor
sessions<00:02:21.630> we<00:02:22.200> created<00:02:22.680> a<00:02:22.890> video<00:02:23.250> on<00:02:23.780> mitosis

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
sessions we created a video on mitosis

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.370 
sessions we created a video on mitosis
and<00:02:24.930> meiosis<00:02:25.610> this<00:02:26.610> video<00:02:26.970> uses<00:02:27.600> animations

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
and meiosis this video uses animations

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.730 
and meiosis this video uses animations
that<00:02:29.220> really<00:02:29.640> allows<00:02:29.940> students<00:02:30.540> to<00:02:30.570> see<00:02:30.750> the

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
that really allows students to see the

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.710 
that really allows students to see the
differences<00:02:32.460> between<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:33.300> two<00:02:33.450> processes

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
differences between the two processes

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.260 
differences between the two processes
how<00:02:34.620> the<00:02:34.680> chromosomes<00:02:35.310> line<00:02:35.610> up<00:02:35.640> and<00:02:35.940> how<00:02:36.090> they

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
how the chromosomes line up and how they

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.300 
how the chromosomes line up and how they
move<00:02:36.510> and<00:02:36.810> these<00:02:37.230> animations<00:02:37.800> can<00:02:37.980> really

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
move and these animations can really

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.000 
move and these animations can really
help<00:02:38.430> students<00:02:38.850> visualize<00:02:39.290> the<00:02:40.290> similarities

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
help students visualize the similarities

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.200 
help students visualize the similarities
and<00:02:41.160> differences<00:02:41.550> between<00:02:41.610> these<00:02:42.030> two

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
and differences between these two

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.670 
and differences between these two
processes<00:02:42.660> and<00:02:43.050> we<00:02:43.170> know<00:02:43.350> that<00:02:43.500> that's

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
processes and we know that that's

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.630 
processes and we know that that's
something<00:02:43.860> that<00:02:44.040> students<00:02:44.340> really<00:02:44.580> struggle

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
something that students really struggle

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.500 
something that students really struggle

we actually follow a baldness trait
through<00:03:00.330> five<00:03:00.570> generations<00:03:01.200> of<00:03:01.320> my<00:03:01.440> family

video tutor on DNA structure I use props
that<00:03:09.090> I<00:03:09.120> think<00:03:09.390> can<00:03:09.510> really<00:03:09.540> help<00:03:09.810> students<00:03:10.440> to

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
that I think can really help students to

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.310 
that I think can really help students to
visualize<00:03:10.880> some<00:03:11.880> of<00:03:11.970> the<00:03:12.030> details<00:03:12.480> of<00:03:12.750> these

visualize some of the details of these

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.470 
visualize some of the details of these
molecules<00:03:13.950> I<00:03:14.220> think<00:03:14.910> that<00:03:15.000> having<00:03:15.360> these

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
molecules I think that having these

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.110 
molecules I think that having these
props<00:03:15.840> and<00:03:16.170> manipulating<00:03:16.980> them<00:03:17.130> can<00:03:17.850> really

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
props and manipulating them can really

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.060 
props and manipulating them can really
help<00:03:18.300> trigger<00:03:18.960> memories<00:03:19.440> in<00:03:19.680> the<00:03:19.770> students

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
help trigger memories in the students

actually<00:04:04.350> see<00:04:04.650> me<00:04:04.860> run<00:04:05.520> through<00:04:05.700> the<00:04:05.940> steps<00:04:06.270> of

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
actually see me run through the steps of

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.520 
actually see me run through the steps of
constructing<00:04:07.320> a<00:04:07.500> DNA<00:04:07.830> profile<00:04:08.310> in<00:04:08.580> the<00:04:08.790> lab<00:04:08.970> I

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
constructing a DNA profile in the lab I

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.100 
constructing a DNA profile in the lab I
think<00:04:10.530> that<00:04:11.280> watching<00:04:11.580> this<00:04:11.970> makes<00:04:12.570> the<00:04:12.780> order

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
think that watching this makes the order

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.860 
think that watching this makes the order
of<00:04:13.260> the<00:04:13.350> steps<00:04:13.560> much<00:04:14.310> more<00:04:14.580> memorable<00:04:15.090> and<00:04:15.300> can

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
of the steps much more memorable and can

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.990 
of the steps much more memorable and can
help<00:04:16.049> students<00:04:16.380> remember<00:04:16.560> how<00:04:17.340> the<00:04:17.400> different

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
help students remember how the different

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.960 
help students remember how the different
methods<00:04:18.840> link<00:04:19.380> together<00:04:19.770> in<00:04:20.460> the<00:04:20.640> overall

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
methods link together in the overall

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.140 
methods link together in the overall
process<00:04:21.390> of<00:04:21.510> making<00:04:21.690> a<00:04:21.930> DNA<00:04:22.200> profile<00:04:23.030> we'll<00:04:24.030> be

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
process of making a DNA profile we'll be

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.880 
process of making a DNA profile we'll be
shooting<00:04:24.540> more<00:04:24.690> video<00:04:25.050> tutor<00:04:25.410> sessions<00:04:25.770> in

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
shooting more video tutor sessions in

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.620 
shooting more video tutor sessions in
the<00:04:25.950> next<00:04:26.220> year<00:04:26.430> so<00:04:26.640> if<00:04:26.730> anybody<00:04:27.030> has<00:04:27.060> any<00:04:27.210> idea

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
the next year so if anybody has any idea

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.280 
the next year so if anybody has any idea
is<00:04:27.780> I'd<00:04:28.620> love<00:04:28.860> to<00:04:28.980> hear<00:04:29.160> about<00:04:29.190> it<00:04:29.490> I<00:04:30.080> do<00:04:31.080> think

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
is I'd love to hear about it I do think

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.620 
is I'd love to hear about it I do think
that<00:04:31.590> these<00:04:31.740> video<00:04:32.070> tutor<00:04:32.430> sessions<00:04:32.850> help<00:04:33.450> my

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
that these video tutor sessions help my

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.050 
that these video tutor sessions help my
students<00:04:34.020> visualize<00:04:34.650> some<00:04:35.430> of<00:04:35.550> these<00:04:35.610> complex

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
students visualize some of these complex

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.420 
students visualize some of these complex
processes<00:04:36.840> you<00:04:37.740> can<00:04:37.920> check<00:04:38.130> them<00:04:38.280> out<00:04:38.370> for

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
processes you can check them out for

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.460 
processes you can check them out for
