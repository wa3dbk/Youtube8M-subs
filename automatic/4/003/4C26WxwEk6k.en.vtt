00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
retention if you happen to catch the

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.550 
retention if you happen to catch the
bottom<00:01:13.010> on<00:01:13.430> something<00:01:14.150> it<00:01:14.270> still<00:01:14.450> takes<00:01:14.780> quite

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
bottom on something it still takes quite

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.640 
bottom on something it still takes quite
a<00:01:15.620> bit<00:01:15.710> of<00:01:15.890> effort<00:01:16.010> to<00:01:16.250> to<00:01:17.120> move<00:01:17.300> it<00:01:17.450> loose<00:01:17.660> so

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
a bit of effort to to move it loose so

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:19.720 
a bit of effort to to move it loose so
because<00:01:18.950> you<00:01:19.040> kind<00:01:19.220> of<00:01:19.280> have<00:01:19.430> to<00:01:19.460> come

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:19.730 
because you kind of have to come

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:23.710 
because you kind of have to come
straight<00:01:20.420> off<00:01:20.740> if<00:01:21.740> you<00:01:21.920> try<00:01:22.190> to<00:01:22.300> angle<00:01:23.300> it<00:01:23.480> it

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
straight off if you try to angle it it

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.410 
straight off if you try to angle it it
binds<00:01:24.170> up<00:01:24.520> in<00:01:25.520> the<00:01:25.640> Kydex<00:01:25.850> because<00:01:26.240> it's

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
binds up in the Kydex because it's

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.520 
binds up in the Kydex because it's
designed<00:01:26.630> to<00:01:26.930> fit<00:01:26.990> perfectly<00:01:27.410> in<00:01:28.160> there<00:01:29.530> and

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
designed to fit perfectly in there and

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.950 
designed to fit perfectly in there and
that's<00:01:30.710> pretty<00:01:30.830> much<00:01:30.950> it<00:01:31.270> initially<00:01:32.270> I<00:01:32.300> wasn't

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
that's pretty much it initially I wasn't

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.930 
that's pretty much it initially I wasn't
planning<00:01:33.740> on<00:01:33.770> getting<00:01:33.980> a<00:01:34.130> different<00:01:34.550> sheath

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
planning on getting a different sheath

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:40.380 
planning on getting a different sheath
for<00:01:35.210> the<00:01:36.040> for<00:01:37.040> the<00:01:37.130> axe<00:01:37.370> but<00:01:37.640> I<00:01:38.320> actually<00:01:39.320> had<00:01:39.800> a

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:40.390 
for the for the axe but I actually had a

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.780 
for the for the axe but I actually had a
fall<00:01:41.390> this<00:01:41.780> came<00:01:42.650> off<00:01:42.830> my<00:01:43.070> pack<00:01:43.310> when<00:01:43.550> I<00:01:43.580> was

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
fall this came off my pack when I was

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.780 
fall this came off my pack when I was
scrambling<00:01:44.180> up<00:01:44.480> a<00:01:44.510> ridge<00:01:45.310> and<00:01:46.310> when<00:01:46.550> it<00:01:46.640> came

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
scrambling up a ridge and when it came

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.340 
scrambling up a ridge and when it came
down<00:01:47.060> it<00:01:47.690> landed<00:01:48.409> right<00:01:48.650> on<00:01:49.400> the<00:01:50.120> sheath<00:01:50.350> blade

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
down it landed right on the sheath blade

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:59.070 
down it landed right on the sheath blade
side<00:01:51.620> down<00:01:51.860> and<00:01:52.190> that<00:01:53.920> axe<00:01:56.170> blade<00:01:57.370> right<00:01:58.370> here

00:01:59.070 --> 00:01:59.080 
side down and that axe blade right here

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.040 
side down and that axe blade right here
just<00:02:00.080> sheared<00:02:00.530> right<00:02:00.830> through<00:02:01.550> the<00:02:02.240> rivets<00:02:02.840> in

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.050

the leather sheath you know it did its

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.870 
the leather sheath you know it did its
job<00:02:06.140> but<00:02:06.530> protected<00:02:06.979> the<00:02:07.070> blade<00:02:07.340> you<00:02:07.580> couldn't

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
job but protected the blade you couldn't

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.690 
job but protected the blade you couldn't
there<00:02:08.060> was<00:02:08.149> no<00:02:08.300> marking<00:02:08.810> on<00:02:08.929> here<00:02:09.399> but<00:02:10.399> I<00:02:10.429> was

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
out the the rivets and I looked locally

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:14.259 
out the the rivets and I looked locally
I<00:02:12.950> thought<00:02:13.400> about<00:02:13.489> maybe<00:02:13.700> get<00:02:13.939> some<00:02:14.150> of<00:02:14.209> the

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
I thought about maybe get some of the

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:16.270 
I thought about maybe get some of the
screw<00:02:14.540> rivets<00:02:14.900> to<00:02:14.989> put<00:02:15.290> in<00:02:15.409> there<00:02:15.590> and<00:02:15.799> I<00:02:15.829> just

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
screw rivets to put in there and I just

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.979 
screw rivets to put in there and I just
didn't<00:02:16.730> find<00:02:16.909> anything<00:02:17.150> around<00:02:17.269> here<00:02:17.810> that

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
didn't find anything around here that

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:18.840 
didn't find anything around here that
would

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
would

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.330 
would
be<00:02:19.000> an<00:02:19.120> easy<00:02:19.270> fix<00:02:19.600> and<00:02:19.930> because<00:02:20.770> that<00:02:20.980> it<00:02:21.220> was

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
be an easy fix and because that it was

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.430 
be an easy fix and because that it was
every<00:02:21.550> time<00:02:21.580> I<00:02:21.790> put<00:02:21.970> the<00:02:22.090> sheath<00:02:22.300> on<00:02:22.540> she<00:02:23.290> had

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
every time I put the sheath on she had

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.410 
every time I put the sheath on she had
to<00:02:23.530> be<00:02:23.650> careful<00:02:24.040> because<00:02:24.220> the<00:02:24.730> blade<00:02:25.090> would

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
to be careful because the blade would

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.080 
to be careful because the blade would
almost<00:02:26.020> pop<00:02:26.590> through<00:02:26.890> you<00:02:27.670> could<00:02:27.790> feel<00:02:28.060> it

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
almost pop through you could feel it

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.940 
almost pop through you could feel it
right<00:02:28.390> here<00:02:28.420> in<00:02:28.660> the<00:02:28.750> middle<00:02:29.080> the<00:02:29.470> outside

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
right here in the middle the outside

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.290 
right here in the middle the outside
rivets<00:02:30.400> were<00:02:30.520> still<00:02:30.730> there<00:02:30.820> and<00:02:30.940> the<00:02:31.030> two<00:02:31.210> in

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.490 
the middle of her gone so effectively
the<00:02:33.910> sheath<00:02:34.150> did<00:02:34.570> his<00:02:34.660> job<00:02:34.930> it<00:02:35.140> saved<00:02:35.350> the

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
the sheath did his job it saved the

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.620 
the sheath did his job it saved the
accid<00:02:35.950> didn't<00:02:36.640> cut<00:02:36.820> anything<00:02:37.000> didn't<00:02:37.450> cut

right shortly after that campfire talked

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.030 
right shortly after that campfire talked
to<00:02:43.330> the<00:02:43.420> video<00:02:43.630> about<00:02:43.750> grizzly<00:02:44.170> outdoors<00:02:44.530> you
