00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 hello to everyone from sardinia motor news 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.899
 we are here at the sestu kart track for the 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.740
 third consecutive year they are leaving 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.690
 right now the poker drift in a group 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.240
 of boys drift enthusiasts who 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.650
 have organized this event 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.190
 the intent to have fun and entertain 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.190
 the public 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.400
 today we are here with a hunter myth 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.250
 said hurricane you say something we have 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.620
 seen little changes made 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.239
 incredible both with the bike and going 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.680
 on two wheels on an off-road vehicle as if 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.230
 nothing happened 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.160
 went in and out of the van you say 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.199
 something of you 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.820
 well let's say that as a child they have 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:03.530
 put in a wheelchair 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.239
 then one day my mom left me 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.430
 downhill it turned over and from there I have 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.940
 I started and my hair have become 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:13.130
 drifting from the hunting staff 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.690
 of course not, and then we say that 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.660
 a sport is something that leaves you there 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:20.210
 inside you start doing maybe in the 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:22.190
 clearing below the house then when you have the 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.380
 possibility of having places like this 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.880
 circuits so we can do things 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.520
 that we have always liked them in safety 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.520
 having fun everyone in a typical group is one 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.410
 beautiful event because in addition to 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.410
 be the world record michele 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:38.479
 pilia maurizio sinus that the said swan 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.340
 that makes another pilot the ramp and then 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.960
 all the drifting guys that are 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.409
 wonderful states I think we have 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.770
 made a wonderful frame 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:50.229
 we like the sound of the phone 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.600
 we say that we managed to do 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:55.210
 a nice create a beautiful day where 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.799

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.259
 even my daughter's kindergarten we have 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:02.649
 made to do laps always in safety 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:05.079
 a three-wheeled bike sponsoring 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:06.640
 the use of the helmet and of course the 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:07.539
 not having to do these things at 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.789
 outside the slopes 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:11.410
 because this is not me to lose i 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:15.489
 points and rather you can lose then 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:17.260
 more then you can have fun you can 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.910
 approach these sports also take 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.220
 even just to see with having 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.840
 the opportunity to do some laps with 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.450
 people who still know what 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.390
 they do and if something happens they are not there 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:31.180
