00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
was like being on some kind of crazy

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.249 
was like being on some kind of crazy
Pink<00:01:15.000> Floyd<00:01:15.180> acid<00:01:15.689> trip<00:01:15.900> throughout<00:01:16.140> the

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
Pink Floyd acid trip throughout the

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.630 
Pink Floyd acid trip throughout the
whole<00:01:16.409> thing<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:16.950> I<00:01:17.250> found<00:01:17.460> myself

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
whole thing and I found myself

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.370 
whole thing and I found myself
fast-forwarding<00:01:18.450> through<00:01:18.479> all<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.869> lips

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
fast-forwarding through all the lips

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.039 
fast-forwarding through all the lips
singing<00:01:19.560> musical<00:01:20.070> parts<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:21.570> think<00:01:21.930> that

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
singing musical parts and I think that

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.929 
singing musical parts and I think that
the<00:01:22.140> storyline<00:01:22.500> was<00:01:22.680> there<00:01:23.100> on<00:01:23.250> its<00:01:23.430> own<00:01:23.610> that

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
the storyline was there on its own that

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.670 
the storyline was there on its own that
it<00:01:24.060> was<00:01:24.150> unnecessary<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:25.080> have<00:01:25.259> all<00:01:25.530> this

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
it was unnecessary to have all this

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.190 
it was unnecessary to have all this
music<00:01:26.280> involved<00:01:26.790> again<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:27.689> think<00:01:27.990> if<00:01:28.080> the

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
music involved again I think if the

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.539 
music involved again I think if the
music<00:01:28.500> wasn't<00:01:28.650> there<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.159> story<00:01:29.400> would<00:01:29.520> have

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
music wasn't there the story would have

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.030
