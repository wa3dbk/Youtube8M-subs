00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:09.429
 so today I start the 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:13.030
 modifications on the g500 so as I 

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:15.930
 I said I'll redo the table 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:19.150
 Carbon board because he is busy 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:23.919
 and that it will be more presentable I will 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:26.409
 also cover the farm optics with the 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:31.149
 yellow transparent film you see 

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:32.619
 here and I did a test on a small 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:35.710
 body part to see what that 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.390
 gives by covering with a film always 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.809
 it's still vinyl that I bought 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.579
 on ebay 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:44.829
 but here it's blue chrome then 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.660
 just for those who would like to know 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:49.570
 how to apply this kind of product 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.129
 I already did a yellow film test 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.879
 for lighthouses you can find 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:57.789
 the video on one tests all points like 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:00.370
 like I had done a test to show 

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:02.949
 quickly the quality of the vinyls on 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.470
 ebay so that's a new vinyl 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:06.760
 carbon that I bought another one of a 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.660
 other seller 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.830
 this one has a bubble-free system but 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.570
 otherwise it's pretty much the same thing 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.910
 like you can find a video 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.130
 a little more explanatory about one tests 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.450
 all points like and so I do not have 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.630
 for now we're doing video that 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.850
 described the vine and the chrome 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.220
 so you can see that gives when 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.690
 even a pretty nice rendering and who 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.820
 really differentiates we do not have 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.310
 the habit of seeing chrome duty of 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.200
 colors but then by cons I 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.030
 will speak again in a more precise video 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.040
 but it's extremely difficult to 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.790
 apply because unlike 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.740
 two others 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.110
 finally to other types of vinyls he 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.810
 stretches very very little if you pull too much 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.360
 the shiny layer is torn and in 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.710
 the more it is thick enough so that 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.900
 when you arrive on the curbs 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.920
 it's not necessarily easy but 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.010
 good 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:00.250
 so that's what I 'm going to do so the 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:02.260
 lighthouse with yellow 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.610
 the dashboard with the carbon and 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.500
 it is surely the same carbon that 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.280
 I will use for the rest for all this 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.220
 who is 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:12.220
 body parts including the 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.870
 tank is so that's an essay I 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.520
 I'll try to put it up just now 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.020
 on the bike see what happens if I 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.040
 find it nice I would surely 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.600
 some parts on the bike in chrome 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.220
 here it is I will not show you so 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:28.090
 exactly how I did I could 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.650
 see that on my old videos and I 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.540
 you find in two small seconds 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.860
 to show you the result on the 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:38.410
 motorcycle so I finished so all 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.150
 two meters on all vinyl 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.230
 pieces I told you about so this 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.350
 which is the most visible property were 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.480
 it's the far so it gives right away 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.519
 a side a little retro and I think it 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.100
 goes well with the machine's style a 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.840
 gap again one will do what's done of 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.569
 more and more rare now except on 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.290
 the bikes when a retro neo look so 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:59.350
 power 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:03.430
 the finish still pretty good 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:11.200
 there are very few bubbles and armed 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:12.459
 did not bother the dashboard so 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.570
 you can see jelly covered with 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.829
 carbon 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:18.090
 I slashed 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:21.760
 can still see the lights 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:24.280
 like the finish is it 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:28.000
 acceptable a few minutes ago 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:30.370
 snags but on bought vinyl 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.650
 on ebay at cheap it is always necessary to 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.390
 doubt one that we do not put a lot of 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.250
 price in the material but we will spend 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.489
 a lot of time to install it and the 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:43.620
 finish will never be so much but that 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.620
 remains perfectly acceptable 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.760
 and the last piece I told you 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.209
 spoke the one I had covered with 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.010
 chromium 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:53.019
 so this is the small room at the back 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.549
 here you can see that it's done 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:57.750
 immediately an effect really cows 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:04:00.519
 members who had to chrome and who 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:04.780
 harmonizes well with the rest of the 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:06.459
 motorcycle so because it's not too bad but 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.349
 that it's still really hard 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:10.750
 to install 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:12.250
 I will not be part of it while 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.110
 curves because vinyl is really 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.919
 very hard to work I count 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:21.210
 plus do a line so that would be the 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:23.740
 extension of this one so that goes 

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:27.729
 leave on the tank like that since 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:30.729
 the tank here at one and quite flat that 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:35.410
 should be quite easy to achieve and 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:39.250
 on the flanks and as well on the d 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:41.650
 carbon back part as on the 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:44.520
 dashboard so carbon effects 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:49.960
 3d mat 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:53.260
 so that's the first step on the 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:55.630
 machine I hope to quickly receive the 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.220
 some the retro I ordered that I 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:00.700
 have already shown you in the video of 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:02.200
 presentation game I would also like 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.630
 as I say repaint the rims 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.460
 but I do not necessarily have time 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:09.340
 to do that right now 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.889
 the mudguard I'm not great fan of 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:15.099
 look he gives to the bike I would like to 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:17.500
 find a little more minimalist who 

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:20.289
 would not have a party like that on the 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.330
 side but I think unless you do 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:23.169
 to make a tailor-made it may be 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.900
 hard to find 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:27.669
 so I 'll see maybe I 'll try 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.880
 giving an effect similar to putting 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:32.470
 different vinyl layers for for 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.639
 harmonize a bit with the bike network 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:37.510
 it remains to be seen 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:39.449
 I must also be able to remove the 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:42.160
 horn rust 

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:45.770
 I thought as I already said in 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:48.930
 the presentation at six meters 1 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:51.240
 a thermal ribbon on the lines 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:53.580
 exhaust to hide a little 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:56.700
 the appearance a little bit corroded and give 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:06:00.540
 a little more look not believe about 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:02.550
 tasks here that can not repaint 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.750
 the whole frame because it would cost me 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:06.630
 far too expensive it would be necessary to make 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:10.560
 notes disassemble the whole bike I'm going 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:13.740
 try to put carbon vinyl that 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:16.770
 I'll cut it at best so that it 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:18.720
 make a look a little more a little more 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:21.750
 clean because it's really dirty 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:25.640
 it is this painting that is going off 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:28.380
 I must also repaint the 

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:29.780
 footguard protector the a6 starts to be 

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:33.330
 rust 

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:35.910
 so these are the next steps of the 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:38.070
 motorcycle if you have questions 

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:41.760
 do not hesitate to put them in 

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:43.710
 comments I will not hesitate to 

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:45.690
 answer as well so on the video 

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:47.220
 on youtube only on my site 

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:49.460
 we test every point like going to 

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.460
 soon
