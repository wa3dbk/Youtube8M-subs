00:04:48.179 --> 00:04:48.189 
I think today was a really good test for

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:49.859 
I think today was a really good test for
us<00:04:48.339> and<00:04:48.610> I<00:04:48.669> think<00:04:48.699> we<00:04:49.029> did<00:04:49.360> really<00:04:49.569> really<00:04:49.659> well

00:04:49.859 --> 00:04:49.869 
us and I think we did really really well

00:04:49.869 --> 00:04:51.570 
us and I think we did really really well
I<00:04:50.020> think<00:04:50.169> the<00:04:50.409> attack<00:04:50.649> really<00:04:50.889> was<00:04:51.099> fluid<00:04:51.459> and

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
I think the attack really was fluid and

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.790 
I think the attack really was fluid and
really<00:04:51.759> connected<00:04:52.209> and<00:04:52.419> so<00:04:53.409> I<00:04:53.439> think<00:04:53.529> we're

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
really connected and so I think we're

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.199 
really connected and so I think we're
really<00:04:53.979> on<00:04:54.219> our<00:04:54.249> way<00:04:54.429> and<00:04:54.729> I<00:04:54.819> think<00:04:54.969> we've<00:04:55.059> got

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:55.209 
really on our way and I think we've got

00:04:55.209 --> 00:05:04.940 
really on our way and I think we've got
a<00:04:55.240> great<00:04:55.419> shot<00:04:55.599> at<00:04:55.689> winning
