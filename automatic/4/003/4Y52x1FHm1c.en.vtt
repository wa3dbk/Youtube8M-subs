I'll<00:02:44.359> also<00:02:44.600> leave<00:02:44.870> the<00:02:45.049> link<00:02:45.079> to<00:02:45.380> that<00:02:45.650> in<00:02:46.010> the

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
I'll also leave the link to that in the

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:48.260 
I'll also leave the link to that in the

description box

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.350 
description box
and<00:02:48.360> as<00:02:48.960> you<00:02:49.230> can<00:02:49.380> see<00:02:49.440> I<00:02:49.620> put<00:02:49.710> the<00:02:50.100> big<00:02:50.360> crystal

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
and as you can see I put the big crystal

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.510 
and as you can see I put the big crystal
first<00:02:51.630> then<00:02:51.960> the<00:02:52.140> chain<00:02:52.410> and<00:02:52.710> I<00:02:52.860> cut<00:02:53.130> the<00:02:53.280> chain

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
first then the chain and I cut the chain

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.080 
first then the chain and I cut the chain
but<00:02:54.530> my<00:02:55.530> tip<00:02:55.830> is<00:02:56.010> to<00:02:56.190> make<00:02:56.220> sure<00:02:56.730> it's<00:02:56.940> long

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
but my tip is to make sure it's long

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.790 
but my tip is to make sure it's long
enough<00:02:57.150> because<00:02:57.540> I<00:02:57.660> lift<00:02:57.990> it<00:02:58.140> a<00:02:58.230> little<00:02:58.500> too

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
enough because I lift it a little too

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.040 
enough because I lift it a little too
short<00:02:59.070> but<00:02:59.430> all<00:02:59.790> I<00:02:59.850> did<00:03:00.240> was<00:03:00.390> I<00:03:00.510> got<00:03:00.690> two<00:03:00.900> little

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
short but all I did was I got two little

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.000 
short but all I did was I got two little
micro<00:03:01.440> beads<00:03:01.680> and<00:03:02.040> I<00:03:02.190> filled<00:03:02.460> in<00:03:02.640> that<00:03:02.670> gap<00:03:03.030> so

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
micro beads and I filled in that gap so

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.680 
micro beads and I filled in that gap so
no<00:03:05.010> problem<00:03:05.490> there<00:03:05.520> we<00:03:05.910> can<00:03:06.060> just<00:03:06.090> fill<00:03:06.540> it<00:03:06.660> in

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
no problem there we can just fill it in

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.450 
no problem there we can just fill it in
with<00:03:06.780> the<00:03:06.990> micro<00:03:07.290> bead<00:03:07.440> I<00:03:07.590> got<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:08.160> micro

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
with the micro bead I got the micro

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.100
