come over to that first one and this can

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.980 
come over to that first one and this can
be<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.310> little<00:01:11.490> tricky<00:01:11.689> you're<00:01:12.689> going<00:01:12.899> to

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
be a little tricky you're going to

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.349 
be a little tricky you're going to
insert<00:01:13.380> your<00:01:13.649> hook<00:01:13.710> through<00:01:14.249> that<00:01:14.909> stitch

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.749 
grab your yarn and pull it through
complete<00:01:18.600> your<00:01:18.810> treble<00:01:19.340> then<00:01:20.340> you're<00:01:20.549> going

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
complete your treble then you're going

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.319

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:24.329 
to do a treble in that next skip stitch

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:26.179 
to do a treble in that next skip stitch
so<00:01:24.990> you<00:01:25.079> see<00:01:25.229> what<00:01:25.350> I<00:01:25.380> mean<00:01:25.590> about<00:01:25.649> being<00:01:26.100> a

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
so you see what I mean about being a

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.649 
so you see what I mean about being a
little<00:01:26.399> tricky<00:01:26.869> pull<00:01:27.869> that<00:01:28.049> through<00:01:29.210> one<00:01:30.210> two

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
little tricky pull that through one two

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.559 
little tricky pull that through one two
three<00:01:31.229> so<00:01:32.069> you've<00:01:32.579> completed<00:01:33.090> it's<00:01:33.389> like<00:01:33.539> a

00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:33.569 
three so you've completed it's like a

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:35.899 
three so you've completed it's like a
cross<00:01:33.840> stitch<00:01:34.319> but<00:01:35.130> when<00:01:35.280> you're<00:01:35.429> doing<00:01:35.759> them

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
cross stitch but when you're doing them

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.730 
cross stitch but when you're doing them
back<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.359> forth<00:01:36.600> on<00:01:36.749> your<00:01:36.929> rows<00:01:37.139> it<00:01:37.409> actually

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
back and forth on your rows it actually

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.739 
back and forth on your rows it actually
creates<00:01:37.889> a<00:01:38.189> zigzag<00:01:38.700> then<00:01:39.270> we're<00:01:39.479> going<00:01:39.630> to

00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:39.749 
creates a zigzag then we're going to

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:42.050 
creates a zigzag then we're going to
double<00:01:40.170> crochet<00:01:40.619> in<00:01:40.889> the<00:01:40.979> next<00:01:41.219> stitch<00:01:41.579> and

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
double crochet in the next stitch and

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.029 
double crochet in the next stitch and
then<00:01:42.539> we're<00:01:42.689> going<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:42.929> do<00:01:43.170> this<00:01:43.350> cross<00:01:43.709> stitch

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:44.039 
then we're going to do this cross stitch

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:46.819 
then we're going to do this cross stitch
again<00:01:44.219> so<00:01:44.579> we're<00:01:44.729> going<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:45.119> treble<00:01:45.899> skip<00:01:46.679> the

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
again so we're going to treble skip the

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:52.419 
again so we're going to treble skip the
to<00:01:47.069> go<00:01:47.909> into<00:01:48.179> this<00:01:48.509> stitch<00:01:49.429> one<00:01:50.429> two<00:01:50.990> three

00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:52.429 
to go into this stitch one two three

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:58.609 
to go into this stitch one two three
yarn<00:01:53.429> around<00:01:53.579> twice<00:01:55.100> one<00:01:56.240> two<00:01:57.240> three<00:01:57.630> and

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
yarn around twice one two three and

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.069 
yarn around twice one two three and
again<00:01:59.279> we're<00:01:59.639> going<00:01:59.819> to<00:01:59.969> go<00:02:00.090> in<00:02:00.299> that<00:02:00.359> stitch

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
again we're going to go in that stitch

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.379 
again we're going to go in that stitch
we've<00:02:01.349> skipped<00:02:01.709> their<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.189> first<00:02:02.429> one<00:02:02.700> so

00:02:03.379 --> 00:02:03.389 
we've skipped their the first one so

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:05.980 
we've skipped their the first one so
