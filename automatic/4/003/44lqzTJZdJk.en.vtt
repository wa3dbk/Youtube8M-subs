00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.649
 Chapter 5 are therefore firm in the 

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:08.350
 freedom with which Christ made us free 

00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:11.590
 and do not be subject again to the yoke of 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:14.230
 slavery I am here I tell you Paul 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:16.960
 if you circumcise you will take advantage of 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.790
 Christ and again testified to everything 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.760
 man that is circumcised that is 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:23.830
 forced to keep all the law of Christ 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.199
 you loose you those who by law 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.840
 you justify of grace you have fallen 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:31.210
 because we by the spirit await 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.670
 by faith the hope of justice 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.399
 because in Christ Jesus neither the 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:40.120
 circumcision is worth something nor the incision 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:42.640
 but the faith that works for love you 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.489
 you would like well who hindered us for not 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.550
 obey the truth this persuasion does not 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:51.999
 comes from the one who calls you a little 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:54.460
 Yeast gives you all the dough I trust 

00:00:51.999 --> 00:00:56.739
 respect of you in the Lord who does not 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.479
 you will think in another way more what you 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.389
 disturbed will carry the sentence 

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:03.850
 whoever it is and I brothers if still 

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:05.680
 I preach circumcision because I suffer 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.570
 persecution still 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.180
 the case has been removed the stumble of the 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:13.030
 cross hopefully mutilated in those who 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.730
 they disturb because you brothers to 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.950
 freedom you were called only that 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:20.770
 do not use freedom as an occasion to 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.560
 the flesh but Serbs for love about 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.990
 to the others because the whole law in this 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.600
 only word is fulfilled, you will love your 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.540
 neighbor as yourself but if you 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.350
 you bite and eat each other look 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:37.780
 that you also do not consume each other 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.720
 I say they have given in the spirit and not 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.310
 satisfy jce the desires of the flesh 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.590
 because the desire of the flesh is against the 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.200
 spirit and that of the spirit is against the 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.750
 meat and these oppose each other to 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.060
 that you do not do what you want but if 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.910
 you are guided by the spirit you are not 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.090
 under the law and manifests are the works 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:00.130
 of the flesh that are adultery 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:04.420
 fornication filth lascivious 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:08.140
 idolatry witchcraft feuds 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:11.350
 jealousy iras dissensions 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:14.380
 heresies envy 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:17.620
 and drunken orgies and similar things 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:20.050
 to these about which he admonished you 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.660
 As I told you earlier than those who 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:25.720
 practice such things will not inherit the 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:30.060
 kingdom of god plus the fruit of the spirit 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:34.780
 it is love joy peace patience benignity 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:37.870
 goodness faith meekness temperance against 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.330
 such things there is no law but those that are 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.360
 of Christ they have crucified the flesh with 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.750
 your passions and desires if we live by the 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:49.090
 spirit, let us also walk in the spirit 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.080
 let's not make ourselves glorious vain irritating 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.910
 one another 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.910
 sending each other
