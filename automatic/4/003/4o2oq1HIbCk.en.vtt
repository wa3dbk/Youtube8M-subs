in this video we're going to demonstrate

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.680 
in this video we're going to demonstrate
how<00:00:03.689> to<00:00:03.720> use<00:00:03.959> the<00:00:04.259> singer<00:00:05.250> quantum<00:00:05.759> stylus<00:00:06.210> 99

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
how to use the singer quantum stylus 99

60s adjustable length and width on

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.780 
60s adjustable length and width on
various<00:00:09.929> stitches<00:00:10.440> it's<00:00:11.099> pretty<00:00:11.370> simple

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
various stitches it's pretty simple

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.360 
various stitches it's pretty simple
whenever<00:00:12.509> you<00:00:12.630> choose<00:00:12.840> any<00:00:13.200> stitch<00:00:13.799> on<00:00:14.099> the

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
whenever you choose any stitch on the

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.490 
whenever you choose any stitch on the
machine<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:15.420> machine<00:00:15.750> automatically

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
machine the machine automatically

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.120 
machine the machine automatically
defaults<00:00:17.250> to<00:00:17.310> it's<00:00:18.000> about<00:00:18.660> mid<00:00:18.990> range<00:00:19.320> length

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
defaults to it's about mid range length

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.000 
defaults to it's about mid range length
and<00:00:20.369> width<00:00:20.550> so<00:00:21.300> right<00:00:21.900> now<00:00:22.080> for<00:00:22.500> example<00:00:22.560> we're

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
and width so right now for example we're

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.670 
and width so right now for example we're
going<00:00:23.279> to<00:00:23.460> do<00:00:23.670> a<00:00:23.970> just<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:24.960> straight<00:00:25.199> stitch<00:00:25.470> and

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
going to do a just a straight stitch and

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.800 
going to do a just a straight stitch and
it's<00:00:25.830> got<00:00:25.949> just<00:00:26.189> its<00:00:26.340> optimal<00:00:26.880> settings

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
it's got just its optimal settings

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.080 
it's got just its optimal settings
chosen<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.890> reason<00:00:29.189> it<00:00:29.310> does<00:00:29.519> that<00:00:29.550> is<00:00:29.880> so

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
chosen and the reason it does that is so

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.580 
chosen and the reason it does that is so
you<00:00:30.660> don't<00:00:30.779> have<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:31.019> sit<00:00:31.199> there<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.349> pull

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
you don't have to sit there and pull

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:32.749 
you don't have to sit there and pull
around<00:00:31.710> with<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.070> length<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.430> width<00:00:32.550> if<00:00:32.669> you

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
around with the length and width if you

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.310 
around with the length and width if you
just<00:00:32.940> want<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:33.180> quick<00:00:33.210> average<00:00:34.020> straight

of the zig-zag stitch and you can

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.460 
of the zig-zag stitch and you can
basically<00:03:27.200> do<00:03:27.740> this<00:03:27.980> on<00:03:29.050> essentially<00:03:30.050> every

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
you to do it on certain machines it

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.930 
you to do it on certain machines it
looks<00:03:41.750> like<00:03:41.959> on<00:03:42.220> this<00:03:43.220> particular<00:03:43.580> machine

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
looks like on this particular machine

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.080 
looks like on this particular machine
the<00:03:44.690> longest<00:03:45.170> length<00:03:45.470> on<00:03:45.770> the<00:03:46.130> like<00:03:46.880> for

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
the longest length on the like for

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.300 
the longest length on the like for
example<00:03:47.180> the<00:03:47.630> triple<00:03:48.410> straight<00:03:48.709> stitch<00:03:48.770> which

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
example the triple straight stitch which

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.790 
example the triple straight stitch which
is<00:03:49.340> a<00:03:49.489> stretch<00:03:49.790> stitch<00:03:50.090> the<00:03:50.690> longest<00:03:51.260> length

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:51.800 
is a stretch stitch the longest length

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.940 
is a stretch stitch the longest length
you<00:03:52.070> can<00:03:52.220> have<00:03:52.400> it<00:03:52.520> on<00:03:52.610> is<00:03:52.810> 2.6<00:03:53.810> and<00:03:54.110> it<00:03:54.739> looks

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
you can have it on is 2.6 and it looks

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.500 
you can have it on is 2.6 and it looks
like<00:03:55.130> it<00:03:55.280> allows<00:03:55.520> you<00:03:55.760> to<00:03:55.880> go<00:03:56.060> down<00:03:56.300> a<00:03:56.330> little

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
like it allows you to go down a little

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.690 
like it allows you to go down a little
low<00:03:56.959> or<00:03:57.200> to<00:03:57.530> bring<00:03:57.950> the<00:03:58.070> stitch<00:03:58.310> closer

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
low or to bring the stitch closer

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.830 
low or to bring the stitch closer
together<00:03:59.590> allows<00:04:00.590> you<00:04:00.770> to<00:04:00.860> go<00:04:00.980> down<00:04:01.160> to<00:04:01.209> 1.4<00:04:02.209> so

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
together allows you to go down to 1.4 so

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.690 
together allows you to go down to 1.4 so
basically<00:04:03.410> it<00:04:03.560> won't<00:04:03.709> let<00:04:03.890> you<00:04:04.070> mess<00:04:04.280> up<00:04:04.310> it

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
basically it won't let you mess up it
