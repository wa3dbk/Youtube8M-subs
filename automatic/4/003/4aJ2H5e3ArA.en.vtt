00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.900

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.550
 beautiful radiant being is not using 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.529
 mask but can highlight the 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.899
 best of your face and thousands 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.880
 thousands of makeup artists on youtube but 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.190
 a lot of them leave out 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.899
 makeup for black skin it is clear that 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.090
 You can learn makeup from a 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.309
 woman of any color but the effect is 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.350
 much bigger when you see a makeup 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.300
 of a person who has the same tone of 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.520
 skin that you and that's why I'm here today 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.350
 to give some makeup tips for 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.050
 the black skin I wanted to make a step to 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.390
 from the beginning of the preparation of the 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.090
 skin until the end of the mec act 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.850
 I hope you like me well. 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.489
 The first tip is to have the skin clean and 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.070
 moisturized to receive makeup 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.049
 black skin tends to be very oily in the 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.299
 what is the use of good 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.040
 face bonus, why are you going to do this? 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.890
 with which the makeup will last much longer 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.229
 time in the black skin some regions of 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.330
 face are darker than other this 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.479
 if you can use a good concealer 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.250
 or have two basic shades so that 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.060
 the skin is homogeneous 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.100
 always avoid bases that are too light 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.240
 if you have trouble finding the 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.790
 right color 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.450
 try mixing two shades one darker 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:43.200
 that its natural color and a lighter color 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.450
 apply the base on all your face and 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.270
 after you have applied the base 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.520
 apply the powder remembering that the powder should be 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.310
 the skin color so that it does not 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.560
 if you wish you can also 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.380
 make use of the outline to leave your 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.869
 The thinner face set for this should 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.060
 use a darker opaque tone than 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.729
 be the two shades darker than your 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:09.270
 can apply on the sides of the nose 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:12.280
 on the side of the forehead below the apples 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.530
 face and jaw is linear 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.950
 the most indicated shade colors 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:21.220
 The wine has always been golden. 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.110
 brass covers the brown itself 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.110
 It's okay that these colors look beautiful, right? 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:29.739
 people but be used 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:33.580
 shadow run of the blue shadow green 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:36.340
 pink reddish tones and even black 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.319
 looks beautiful on black skin the same 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.410
 thing lipstick all makeup 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:44.470
 bet on the darker tones in the tones 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.330
 closed because they stand out more 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.080
 on black skin and gives a more 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.910
 Natural 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.470
 but that does not mean that there is 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.200
 rules or limits 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.170
 The important thing is that you feel good and use 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.780
 something that matches your personality 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.519
 be pink nude or even that 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.680
 radiant red 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:05.470
 already the best shades of skin blush 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:09.040
 black are intense colors like red 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:12.190
 orange wine and even pink 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.330
 black skin is not opaque it has shine 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.069
