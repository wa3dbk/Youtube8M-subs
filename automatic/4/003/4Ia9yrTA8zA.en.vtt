00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
finish itself is a little bit longer now

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:13.710 
finish itself is a little bit longer now
at<00:03:12.220> at<00:03:12.310> least<00:03:12.370> lasts<00:03:12.940> until<00:03:13.060> the<00:03:13.240> next<00:03:13.450> draw

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
at at least lasts until the next draw

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.480 
at at least lasts until the next draw
but<00:03:14.500> no<00:03:15.370> other<00:03:15.580> flavors<00:03:16.260> that's<00:03:17.260> it<00:03:17.470> so<00:03:18.400> I'll

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:18.490 
but no other flavors that's it so I'll

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.310 
but no other flavors that's it so I'll
keep<00:03:18.640> going<00:03:18.700> and<00:03:19.180> hopefully<00:03:19.630> we<00:03:19.960> get<00:03:20.050> some

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
keep going and hopefully we get some

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.320 
keep going and hopefully we get some
kind<00:03:20.500> of<00:03:20.560> change<00:03:20.800> and<00:03:21.580> as<00:03:21.790> I<00:03:21.850> go<00:03:21.940> towards<00:03:22.120> the

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
through the finish I wish the entire

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.600 
through the finish I wish the entire
cigar<00:03:54.230> had<00:03:54.470> a<00:03:54.500> little<00:03:54.950> bit<00:03:55.100> more<00:03:55.340> of<00:03:55.460> the

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:55.610 
cigar had a little bit more of the

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.910 
cigar had a little bit more of the
flavors<00:03:56.000> but<00:03:56.210> this<00:03:56.810> last<00:03:57.080> half<00:03:57.320> was<00:03:57.380> certainly

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
flavors but this last half was certainly

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.120 
flavors but this last half was certainly
enjoyable<00:03:58.330> $4<00:03:59.330> stick<00:03:59.690> I<00:03:59.870> can't<00:04:00.260> complain<00:04:00.680> does

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130

burn<00:04:01.460> okay<00:04:02.350> decent<00:04:03.350> flavors<00:04:03.710> especially

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.670 
burn okay decent flavors especially
towards<00:04:04.550> the<00:04:04.610> end<00:04:04.790> so<00:04:05.140> I'd<00:04:06.140> say<00:04:06.380> this<00:04:06.500> is<00:04:06.650> a

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
towards the end so I'd say this is a

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.850 
towards the end so I'd say this is a
little<00:04:06.890> bit<00:04:07.130> more<00:04:07.630> than<00:04:08.630> you<00:04:08.780> pay<00:04:08.900> for<00:04:08.930> so<00:04:09.740> if

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
little bit more than you pay for so if

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:10.960 
little bit more than you pay for so if
it<00:04:09.980> sounds<00:04:10.250> like<00:04:10.400> something<00:04:10.670> you<00:04:10.730> might<00:04:10.760> enjoy
