the<00:01:47.970> whole<00:01:48.119> game<00:01:48.360> so<00:01:48.390> I<00:01:48.689> can<00:01:49.049> understand<00:01:49.560> why

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
the whole game so I can understand why

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.770 
the whole game so I can understand why
you<00:01:49.829> decided<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.399> rage<00:01:50.670> quit<00:01:50.970> but<00:01:51.240> still<00:01:51.600> it's

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
you decided to rage quit but still it's

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.389 
you decided to rage quit but still it's
kind<00:01:52.020> of<00:01:52.079> stupid<00:01:52.259> because<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:52.829> will<00:01:53.009> ruin<00:01:53.159> your

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
kind of stupid because it will ruin your

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.730 
kind of stupid because it will ruin your
dnf<00:01:53.909> for<00:01:54.149> any<00:01:54.360> future<00:01:54.570> games<00:01:54.990> so<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.259> get<00:01:55.590> less

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
dnf for any future games so you get less

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.209 
dnf for any future games so you get less
coins<00:01:56.040> so<00:01:56.700> I<00:01:56.729> that's<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:57.719> pretty<00:01:58.290> stupid<00:01:59.040> in<00:01:59.159> my

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
coins so I that's a pretty stupid in my

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.480

score<00:05:52.400> a<00:05:52.430> few<00:05:52.730> miracles<00:05:52.990> because<00:05:53.990> I<00:05:54.320> mean

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:54.470 
score a few miracles because I mean

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.560 
score a few miracles because I mean
dropping<00:05:55.040> your<00:05:55.220> control<00:05:55.610> is<00:05:55.760> probably<00:05:56.120> like

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:56.570 
dropping your control is probably like

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:59.980 
dropping your control is probably like
it's<00:05:57.110> so<00:05:57.470> annoying<00:05:57.740> to<00:05:57.890> play<00:05:58.160> against<00:05:58.580> I<00:05:58.990> would

00:05:59.980 --> 00:05:59.990 
it's so annoying to play against I would

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:01.890 
it's so annoying to play against I would
rather<00:06:00.140> just<00:06:00.500> have<00:06:00.650> my<00:06:00.680> opponent<00:06:01.190> backing<00:06:01.490> out

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:01.900 
rather just have my opponent backing out

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.110 
rather just have my opponent backing out
