00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
I pull one of these up sure and how big

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.789 
I pull one of these up sure and how big
will<00:01:30.150> that<00:01:30.360> sugar<00:01:30.659> beet<00:01:30.869> get<00:01:31.140> so<00:01:31.530> yeah<00:01:31.650> that's

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
will that sugar beet get so yeah that's

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.109 
will that sugar beet get so yeah that's
the<00:01:31.920> start<00:01:32.189> of<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.310> sugar<00:01:32.520> beet<00:01:32.729> right<00:01:32.909> there

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
the start of the sugar beet right there

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.789 
the start of the sugar beet right there
root<00:01:33.540> that's<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.170> root<00:01:34.320> right<00:01:34.350> there<00:01:34.710> and

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
root that's the root right there and

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:35.960 
root that's the root right there and
that<00:01:34.920> root<00:01:35.130> will<00:01:35.280> just<00:01:35.430> keep<00:01:35.579> getting<00:01:35.850> bigger

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
that root will just keep getting bigger

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.539 
that root will just keep getting bigger
and<00:01:36.329> it's<00:01:36.960> gonna<00:01:37.140> grow<00:01:37.380> probably<00:01:38.100> about<00:01:38.310> this

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
and it's gonna grow probably about this

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.530 
and it's gonna grow probably about this
long<00:01:38.960> this<00:01:39.960> big<00:01:40.229> and<00:01:40.409> wide<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:41.360> that<00:01:42.360> should

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
long this big and wide and that should

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.170 
long this big and wide and that should
get<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.750> be<00:01:42.869> 8<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.409> 10<00:01:43.590> pounds<00:01:43.829> 8<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.579> 10<00:01:44.759> pounds

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
get to be 8 to 10 pounds 8 to 10 pounds

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.219 
get to be 8 to 10 pounds 8 to 10 pounds
yeah<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.570> that's<00:01:46.020> sugar<00:01:46.439> that's<00:01:46.860> sugar<00:01:48.229> 5

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
yeah and that's sugar that's sugar 5
