00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.030 
have to wait until the end of the game
where<00:00:30.330> you<00:00:30.420> can<00:00:30.599> find<00:00:30.840> them<00:00:31.109> in<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.619> kiln<00:00:31.859> of

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
the first flame this is almost

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.520 
the first flame this is almost
definitely<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.480> highest<00:00:36.809> damage<00:00:36.989> weapon

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
definitely the highest damage weapon

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.860 
definitely the highest damage weapon
that<00:00:37.680> you<00:00:37.829> can<00:00:38.010> get<00:00:38.190> early<00:00:38.610> on<00:00:38.700> in<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.940> game<00:00:38.969> it

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
that you can get early on in the game it

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.260 
that you can get early on in the game it
does<00:00:40.170> significantly<00:00:40.829> higher<00:00:41.550> damage<00:00:41.820> than

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
does significantly higher damage than

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.560 
does significantly higher damage than
the<00:00:42.300> drake<00:00:42.690> sword<00:00:44.180> one<00:00:45.180> of<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.390> downsides

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
the drake sword one of the downsides

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.750 
the drake sword one of the downsides
that<00:00:46.200> this<00:00:46.320> sword<00:00:46.649> is<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.890> heavy<00:00:47.399> attack

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
that this sword is the heavy attack

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.959 
that this sword is the heavy attack
which<00:00:48.770> just<00:00:49.770> takes<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.100> bit<00:00:50.129> too<00:00:50.460> long<00:00:50.730> to

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
which just takes a bit too long to

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.779 
which just takes a bit too long to
charge<00:00:51.180> up<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:52.199> you<00:00:52.829> may<00:00:53.010> as<00:00:53.070> well<00:00:53.160> just<00:00:53.520> do

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
charge up and you may as well just do

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.139 
charge up and you may as well just do
two<00:00:54.390> lights<00:00:55.140> axe<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:55.860> it'll<00:00:56.640> end<00:00:56.760> up<00:00:56.879> doing

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
two lights axe and it'll end up doing

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.660 
two lights axe and it'll end up doing
more<00:00:57.300> damage<00:00:57.510> anyway<00:00:58.280> this<00:00:59.280> sword<00:00:59.550> will

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
more damage anyway this sword will

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.979 
more damage anyway this sword will
probably<00:01:00.030> be<00:01:00.149> pretty<00:01:00.390> good<00:01:00.629> for<00:01:00.870> like

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
probably be pretty good for like

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.219 
probably be pretty good for like
mid-level<00:01:01.620> PBB<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:03.210> has<00:01:03.390> quite<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:03.690> nice<00:01:03.899> wide

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
mid-level PBB it has quite a nice wide

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.250 
mid-level PBB it has quite a nice wide
arc<00:01:04.619> swing<00:01:05.450> but<00:01:06.450> once<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:06.810> get<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:06.990> higher

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
arc swing but once you get to higher

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.679 
arc swing but once you get to higher
level<00:01:07.560> PvP<00:01:08.130> it's<00:01:08.520> not<00:01:09.000> doesn't<00:01:09.390> really<00:01:09.420> do

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
level PvP it's not doesn't really do

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.149 
level PvP it's not doesn't really do
enough<00:01:09.900> damage<00:01:09.930> you'd<00:01:10.500> be<00:01:10.619> better<00:01:10.830> off<00:01:10.950> with

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
enough damage you'd be better off with

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.030 
enough damage you'd be better off with
one<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.549> other<00:01:11.580> weapons<00:01:12.470> like<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.710> great
