00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.790
 welcome all subscribers to the channel here 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.170
 fan with you rude this transfer is easy 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.740
 which digest you always create 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.490
 some interesting fresh and 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.799
 educational news 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.800
 in today's issue you will learn how 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.350
 the way you can get from 5 when 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.890
 and how personal combat will change 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.050
 tasks when to wait for new hd-models 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.590
 naturally still a whole bunch of interesting 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.590
 of news 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.059
 probably all of you are tired of what you have 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.920
 often the same card comes out 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.329
 for example, some kind of prokhorovka or 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.129
 something like that by the way 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.510
 really a common problem 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.120
 developers on their official 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.820
 Twitter reports that this problem is very 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.829
 will soon be fixed how not 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.260
 known but if it is not, it will be 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.449
 just gorgeous in addition to the official 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.610
 twitter word of tanks it became known that 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.730
 at the end of the summer we are waiting for a new superior 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:03.329
 chat and very soon promise another 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.250
 tank marathon so we are waiting for this 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.680
 moment are developing some new 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.260
 four mechanics for 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.420
 our favorite artillery apparently this 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.240
 all to Artem was difficult and 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.340
 it is easier for us though everything can be 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.409
 but of the latter from the types of developers 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.780
 and generally I want to believe that it will be 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.570
 That's exactly because if art somehow about here 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.240
 then it will be unfair and fights 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.130
 it was recently calculated that if 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.350
 add pace as now, and 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.990
 jdi model is all about 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.479
 in five years and by the way in this something 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.400
 there are in fact for the year added only 60 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.380
 and wait for the models on what the developers 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.240
 answer that no everything happens much 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.340
 quicker possible developers 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.759
 really accelerate but for now it is 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.159
 absolutely not noticed and by the way 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.890
 despite the fact that you shore will end 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.530
 before patch 97 appears 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.100
 developers will not add to 97 anyway 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.270
 IS-3 Pershing and 50100 although before 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.450
 it was assumed that these tanks will not 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.640
 precisely because of baby 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.759
 Andy but one hundred percent known 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.250
 98 to appear from 3 and super pershing 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:13.440
 That's about 50100 and Pershing for now 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:16.420
 unclear and remember the tank of 5 or the object 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.849
 730 so it became known that this is a tank 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.950
 It will be available only for the event on 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:22.780
 century the details are unknown but by 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.209
 apparently it will be very similar with 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.670
 companies but buy this tank at all 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:30.099
 probably never be able to so 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.739
 while there is time looking for a good clan to 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:34.660
 get this car and by the way of 5 will 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.640
 very cool car or at the same time 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.980
 full prem that is on it 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.410
 it will be possible to pofarmit as it was with 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.390
 t23 e3 so fight for it 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.150
 it really makes sense and tank 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:49.269
 It turns out very cool in fact from 8 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.190
 at the eighth level rumbled that 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:54.400
 our game may appear such a tank 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.200
 like tiger 131 bovington this is the one 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.930
 tiger who took part in the shooting 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.549
 films yuri and most likely he will appear in 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.040
 the same form as in the movie with 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:05.560
 exclusive yellow camouflage and gun 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.600
 l 56 but the most interesting thing is that 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.700
 this car will be located on the sixth 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:13.660
 level my opinion consists only of 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:16.480
 three words the next unnecessary clone patch 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.730
 98 will be a major personal change 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.760
 combat tasks touch they specifically 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.459
 conditions and side relief and 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.310
 diversity will also reduce the impact 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.410
 randomly on the task will leave only arson 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.660
 and also change the order of issue in 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.730
 operations pieces and platoon task now 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.010
 it will be possible to perform solo but only in 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.260
 if you have enough skill and 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.600
 do not worry that your progress 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.700
 tasks will be changed actually all 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.500
 I personally will remain the same throughout the 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.019
 very happy because if really 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.609
 reduce the impact of the random house and make 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:50.560
 more some serious 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:52.390
 diverse and more interesting to ask 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.640
 what will be less moments when people 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:57.550
 write out start the fight give me a ram or 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.560
 something like that on this plan today 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.720
 release of light digest ends 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.940
 I hope you were interested with you 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.890
 as always hamish do not forget to put 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.080
 like this video subscribe to my 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.600
