00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
game in the SEC and we just put it up we

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.210 
game in the SEC and we just put it up we
gritted<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:35.970> out<00:01:36.380> the<00:01:37.380> reps<00:01:37.619> helped<00:01:37.920> us<00:01:38.040> out

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
something like that but from what I

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.450 
something like that but from what I
understand<00:02:16.320> they're<00:02:16.440> not<00:02:16.590> allowed<00:02:16.830> to<00:02:16.860> check

understand they're not allowed to check

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.080 
understand they're not allowed to check
a<00:02:18.680> shot<00:02:19.680> clock<00:02:19.860> like<00:02:20.100> that<00:02:20.310> ladies<00:02:20.550> call<00:02:20.850> it

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
a shot clock like that ladies call it

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.180 
a shot clock like that ladies call it
whatever<00:02:21.270> they<00:02:21.600> call<00:02:21.840> it<00:02:21.870> stands<00:02:22.560> and<00:02:23.040> that's

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
whatever they call it stands and that's

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:29.180 
whatever they call it stands and that's
how<00:02:23.340> it<00:02:23.460> is<00:02:24.200> so<00:02:25.220> Kentucky<00:02:26.220> pulls<00:02:26.460> it<00:02:26.610> out<00:02:28.190> not

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
how it is so Kentucky pulls it out not

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.410 
how it is so Kentucky pulls it out not
too<00:02:29.400> impressed<00:02:29.790> with<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.090> wind<00:02:30.300> but<00:02:32.120> it<00:02:33.120> wins

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
too impressed with the wind but it wins

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.690 
too impressed with the wind but it wins
a<00:02:33.570> win<00:02:33.750> we<00:02:34.650> could<00:02:34.830> have<00:02:34.920> lost<00:02:35.040> this<00:02:35.310> game<00:02:35.430> it'd

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
a win we could have lost this game it'd

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.770 
a win we could have lost this game it'd
be<00:02:35.850> a<00:02:35.880> lot<00:02:36.060> worse<00:02:36.270> so<00:02:36.920> I'll<00:02:37.920> take<00:02:38.220> it<00:02:38.570> we<00:02:39.570> can

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
be a lot worse so I'll take it we can

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.270 
be a lot worse so I'll take it we can
build<00:02:39.900> on<00:02:40.110> this<00:02:40.260> hopefully<00:02:40.740> because<00:02:40.950> it<00:02:41.100> was<00:02:41.250> a

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
build on this hopefully because it was a

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.210 
build on this hopefully because it was a
road<00:02:41.550> game<00:02:41.820> in<00:02:42.060> a<00:02:42.180> araina<00:02:42.740> that<00:02:43.740> we've<00:02:44.040> never
