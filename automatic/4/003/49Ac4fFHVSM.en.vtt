00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 hey good that as they are here they 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.060
 greeting salvatto 820 and we are a cat 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.160
 more video from minecraft and today I bring you 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.380
 what has been the information of the 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.269
 new update that came out today 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.730
 who surely must be seeing this 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.710
 video already quite late so you can 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.029
 say came out the update so 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.619
 Well, I'm going to show you what I 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.500
 I feel a little bit the information that 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.990
 It came out in this new update but 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.060
 I could not do everything in one video 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.039
 because there are so many, many things 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.439
 the truth so there are going to be several 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.440
 several videos very, very closely followed by 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.090
 this update because I'm going to 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.670
 inform more or less of the changes that 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.410
 have done so well as I say I'm going to 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.270
 make several videos because I'm going to 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.010
 explain them little by little of all 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.800
 the things that they have gotten and that's because 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.610
 they are many, so without further delay 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.610
 Let's go there 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.160
 so first of all this the informative 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.780
 what I'm going to give is going to be just what 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.820
 principal what has been in 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.710
 minecraft in the next part then I'm going 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.869
 to teach of the things that they have put 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.970
 to what saying in the update 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:12.220
 so now let's start here 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.950
 with the game menu as you can see 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.619
 this is the menu normally ok if you go 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.360
 to play is not like before now is 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:21.460
 much much more different surely 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.690
 Many of you will already know because the 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.940
 video so I'm doing it a bit 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.649
 late and as you can see here they are going to see 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.280
 because all the worlds that you have 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:31.840
 here they can create world ok this very but 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.330
 very important you can play in these 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.420
 worlds this here we have a new world 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.220
 that we have put of the book big planet ' 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.659
 also there so it can its pretty 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.569
 pretty good after I'll explain 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:46.030
 what is this for and what is the 

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:49.509
 benefit what you have to create a new 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.950
 ok world and here the income join when 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.200
 you then join in what has been 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.819
 with other people or with your friends with your 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.920
 players and all that there is here is 

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:58.780
 to join nothing more and as I say no 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.939
 so it was now let's go to the 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.510
 game to teach them some changes that 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:03.760
 have 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.960
 there has been first before entering 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.990
 to the game what you have to do is 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.090
 put host privileges and all 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.060
 all the trophies achievements are going to 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.760
 deactivate because you can not play this 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.620
 with privileges of power and power 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.210
 take out the trophies I want to say that 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.280
 we are going to use it right now 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.740
 just to show you the changes 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.540
 that they have that are in the link game to 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.850
 this update for you to see 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.130
 and then you will know whether to use it or not 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.990
 use it so we go there good already 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.700
 we are here this I mean that what 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.530
 that I 'm going to show you in this video is going to 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.660
 be only things that have changed 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.890
 I'm not going to show you objects or anything 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.930
 that's because I can point that out to you 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.760
 another video because if not the video is made 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.860
 too long and I know I 'm going to leave one 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.240
 that another little thing not so let's go 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.250
 step by step now I'm going to show you 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.860
 only the changes they have made in 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.140
 what is now in the system nothing 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.000
 more not so first we can go 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.670
 here we are going to go to the host option 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.730
 when you go to filter option this 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:03.370
 can see what you can put it 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:06.070
 set in day that's how it is now 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.840
 same ok and you can set it from 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.770
 night what does this mean that you what 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.780
 you can do at night 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:13.000
 at the time that you want for example I 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.740
 I press here and it 's night I 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.480
 pressed here and it 's day that's 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:20.080
 quite interesting enough the truth 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.700
 by the point of when we say this is 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.640
 at night and you want to put it in the daytime 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:27.280
 makes it easy to directly put it on 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.590
 not here but the problem is that if you 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.230
 not what you can not use it in 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.780
 survival can only be used 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.640
 using what they say 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.820
 host privileges so the 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.730
 trophies you will not get what you can not get 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:44.020
 trophies on this map that you use 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.360
 host privileges so this 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.790
 you can use it for a series but not 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.650
 to take out the trophies not as they can 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.750
 see you can change girl and 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.670
 you can change something else at night 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.220
 important and good is that you can 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.380
 change the difficulty being in already 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.810
 in the game previously you could not 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.960
 but now you can do it and that's 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:07.900
 really good but also using as 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:10.240
 I also say using this privileges 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:13.940
 of the host is a bad thing the truth 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:16.790
 because they can not get the trophies 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.290
 and it's just the same way not like that 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:20.750
 that here too can change 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.940
 fire mode you can put here in 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.210
 survival mode and you can put it 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:28.310
 here in creative mode and adventure mode 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:31.910
 being already within the same game is what 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:35.330
 I 'm selling because he's flying it because 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:38.390
 if you say and the map has a fault and 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.460
 you die ok or you are going to die and you are 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:43.580
 exactly playing survival 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:45.200
 let's say and you know that you are going to fall and not 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.970
 it's your problem but it's the problem 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.310
 of the game that became any other 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:53.270
 thing you come and change it lightly to 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:56.240
 creative then then let's say later 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:59.420
 you leave before dying we tell you 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:01.940
 you go out or you go out and put it back in 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:03.950
 survival that is something terrific not 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.530
 for example if your head in lava is 

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:08.750
 normal you come and change it to creative 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.820
 and you're not going to die, you go out and wait 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:12.440
 Remove the fire from the lava and put it on 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.320
 again in survival that's 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.180
 really great very, very good 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.770
 the truth to themselves as a series 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.110
 you already have to explain exactly how 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:24.070
 you're going to do it and here we can put 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:27.680
 we can see what it says to define point of 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:29.720
 reappearance of the world this I believe that 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:33.110
 is for the tube to appear exactly 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:35.050
 at that point that you have put there no longer 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:37.430
 will appear where exactly 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:39.320
 you appeared the first time I imagine myself 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:41.780
 that has to be like that so that's a 

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:45.140
 it's quite important because sometimes you 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:47.330
 you choose a map and the map they give you 

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:49.130
 you appear in the jungle and you do not like it and 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.640
 you do not like your place but you know that 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:54.950
 if you use the compass, it will take you 

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:56.870
 exactly up to where 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:06:00.470
 appears for the first time that would be the 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:02.420
 jungle then with this and you when you 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:04.460
 you're going to appear exactly there 

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:06.020
 so that 's quite enough 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.640
 Well, I hope it's like that 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:10.310
 so down here we can see the 

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:12.860
 Clear weather is how it is right now 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:14.870
 that is nothing but if we 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:17.180
 we put rainy 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:20.360
 we have to leave 2 and it starts to rain 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:22.640
 as you can see it's raining ok that's 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:25.180
 very, very fun to be fun and 

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:29.000
 pretty good and when you put it on 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:31.910
 stormy as they fall to rays 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.830
 thunder and all that is really very but 

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:35.960
 very beautiful the truth you can there as 

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.940
 can see there that there is a lightning bolt fell 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.880
 exactly on the tree if you 

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:43.820
 they saw no rewind the video they're going to 

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:47.120
 to see this again you can not change it and 

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:50.060
 you can come and put it back in 

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:52.670
 cleared normally as I say very but 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:54.560
 very pretty quite interesting 

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:57.590
 the truth in this update here 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:59.390
 how can you do yourself but as 

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:01.640
 I say all this you have to use 

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:03.830
 Host privileges and your trophies 

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:05.750
 Well, no longer has heard no no 

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:07.850
 so here you can see you can 

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:09.740
 change everything then what you want ok 

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:11.900
 this is really quite pretty 

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:14.480
 pretty good to be said here 

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:16.370
 we have this as I tell you I'm going to do 

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:18.440
 videos little by little so that you then 

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:20.690
 go knowing what we are going 

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.470
 changing and all that so this one was 

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:25.640
 exactly 

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:27.290
 have put let me see here here good 

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:29.240
 exactly here you can change 

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:32.680
 also the same or as a game 

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:34.880
 creative survival this is normal 

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:37.040
 here because this this was already 

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:39.440
 previously this because we already had it 

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:41.630
 this if we had not already Now 

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:44.120
 we can have so, as I say 

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:46.550
 Now there's going to be a series of 

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:47.990
 videos on the news channel of 

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:50.720
 all the things that have come out 

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:53.960
 it was only the panel only let's say 

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:56.000
 the as I say the menu what brings the
