00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:16.680
 Since its invention the billiards have been a station for attention and experimentation by physicists and mathematicians. 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:24.420
 This is because it is a great example of how to move and bounce atoms, or to move in this case billiard balls. 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.400
 So now! Enough for these theoretical experiments, let's start building one and apply it. 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:36.500
 The table is oval, and the elliptical shapes are interesting because of its many varieties. 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:47.820
 Oval shapes have distinctive geometric features. If this ball is placed at the point of centering the oval shape (the table). 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:57.180
 The ball will be thrown in any direction, here or here or there. Leading to their descent and falling into the pit. 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:04.900
 This is due to the angle that the ball makes from any point with the center point? 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.500
 As we know, when objects bounce off a surface .. 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.560
 The angle of fall equals the recoil angle (reflection). 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.340
 If the ball is placed at the point of concentration, any shot will enter the ball into the hole. 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.280
 If the ball is here (not the center point), then the ball will not fall into the hole. 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.940
 You will only fall if you find at this point. 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.480
 Okay ! This is the theory, really enjoyable. 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:32.280
 But I'm a mathematician, I like to be perfect stuff. This is not possible! In fact .. 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.660
 There are disturbing physical forces that hinder the process. 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.780
 Strength of friction, and distortions resulting from the difficulty of manufacturing. 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.920
 In addition, the ball must be hit by the appropriate force. 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.640
 For example, if struck by excessive force .. 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.380
 .. It will be reluctant from this side away from the hole. 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.760
 But if they hit it with exaggerated tenderness. 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.460
 .. Vhaha will hesitate from the opposite side completely. 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:07.460
 It is therefore clear that there is an appropriate moderate strike, neither strong nor weak. 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:08.720
 Okay ! Now see if I can do it. 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.860
 it is so difficult. 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.080
 You must be really professional. 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.340
 Very nice, I did it! 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:24.260
 It is very interesting to see the ball spinning constantly until it settles inside the hole. 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.840
 Well, now I'll hit it there. 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.980
 In fact we can choose anywhere else. 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.360
 Again, this strike will not be easy because I did not get used to it much. 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.260
 I'm not good at billiards. 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.520
 But if you hit it like this .. 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.300
 Uh !! 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.340
 Photographer: Take the camera, it's my turn to pay. 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:12.620
 Wonderful ! 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.700
 At first I was sad because it was difficult .. 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.200
 But then I realized that he was more than happy to do the difficult things. 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.740
 In the beginning, place the white ball at one point of the line between the black ball and the hole 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.220
 You are probably thinking about this point and how things were going to be from this point. 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.580
 I have to push the black ball to this edge .. Translated by: Sami Sarraj
