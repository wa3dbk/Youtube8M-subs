00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
can see that I've added little crosses

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.310 
can see that I've added little crosses
in<00:00:31.999> the<00:00:32.119> areas<00:00:32.450> that<00:00:32.630> are<00:00:32.750> all<00:00:32.870> going<00:00:33.110> to<00:00:33.230> be

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
in the areas that are all going to be

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.810 
in the areas that are all going to be
black<00:00:33.590> so<00:00:34.010> I'm<00:00:34.100> just<00:00:34.310> looking<00:00:34.610> at<00:00:34.700> these

black so I'm just looking at these

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.850 
black so I'm just looking at these
darkest<00:00:35.390> parts<00:00:35.720> of<00:00:35.870> the<00:00:35.960> hair<00:00:36.140> and<00:00:36.350> I'm<00:00:36.650> going

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
darkest parts of the hair and I'm going

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.410 
darkest parts of the hair and I'm going
to<00:00:36.950> fill<00:00:37.250> them<00:00:37.460> in<00:00:37.490> where<00:00:37.940> I've<00:00:38.060> done<00:00:38.300> the

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
to fill them in where I've done the

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:44.540 
to fill them in where I've done the
crosses

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.910 

now<00:00:45.550> I'm<00:00:45.700> going<00:00:45.970> to<00:00:46.000> go<00:00:46.239> in<00:00:46.420> and<00:00:46.660> add<00:00:47.620> a<00:00:47.860> little

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
now I'm going to go in and add a little

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.030 
now I'm going to go in and add a little
bit<00:00:48.489> of<00:00:48.610> dimension<00:00:48.820> two<00:00:49.510> lines<00:00:49.840> at<00:00:50.680> a<00:00:50.739> large

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.040 
bit of dimension two lines at a large

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.850 
bit of dimension two lines at a large
height<00:00:51.660> coming<00:00:52.660> at<00:00:52.750> this<00:00:52.930> angle<00:00:53.440> down<00:00:53.590> from

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:53.860 
height coming at this angle down from

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.560 
height coming at this angle down from
the<00:00:53.950> top<00:00:54.129> of<00:00:54.250> the<00:00:54.370> hair<00:00:54.550> and<00:00:54.730> one<00:00:55.120> coming<00:00:55.360> from

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:55.570 
the top of the hair and one coming from

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.930 
the top of the hair and one coming from
the<00:00:55.750> bottom<00:00:56.020> up<00:00:56.170> only<00:00:57.040> very<00:00:57.250> light<00:00:57.520> but<00:00:57.820> this

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
the bottom up only very light but this

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.610 
the bottom up only very light but this
adds<00:00:58.210> dimension<00:00:58.420> to<00:00:58.840> it

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.930 

so<00:01:03.490> has<00:01:03.730> the<00:01:03.910> texture<00:01:04.239> actually<00:01:04.420> created<00:01:05.140> well

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
so has the texture actually created well

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.340 
so has the texture actually created well
let's<00:01:06.940> have<00:01:07.120> a<00:01:07.180> quick<00:01:07.450> look<00:01:07.630> just<00:01:08.140> grab

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
let's have a quick look just grab

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.530 
let's have a quick look just grab
another<00:01:08.470> piece<00:01:08.800> of<00:01:08.980> paper<00:01:09.190> here<00:01:09.490> for<00:01:09.730> hair

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
another piece of paper here for hair

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.550 
another piece of paper here for hair
texture<00:01:11.020> is<00:01:11.229> most<00:01:11.590> easily<00:01:11.860> created<00:01:12.520> by<00:01:13.180> doing

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
texture is most easily created by doing

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.740 
texture is most easily created by doing
very<00:01:14.560> fast<00:01:14.979> dagger<00:01:15.430> strokes<00:01:15.820> and<00:01:16.060> lines<00:01:16.300> back

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
very fast dagger strokes and lines back

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.000 
very fast dagger strokes and lines back
and<00:01:16.960> forth

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.010 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.160 

we're<00:01:22.010> actually<00:01:22.159> going<00:01:22.580> to<00:01:22.760> offset<00:01:23.170> every

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
we're actually going to offset every

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.230 
we're actually going to offset every
couple<00:01:24.560> of<00:01:24.680> hairs<00:01:24.890> so<00:01:25.369> that<00:01:25.580> it's<00:01:25.729> flowing<00:01:26.119> in

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
couple of hairs so that it's flowing in

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.050 
couple of hairs so that it's flowing in
the<00:01:26.360> same<00:01:26.659> direction<00:01:26.960> but<00:01:27.740> not<00:01:27.950> too<00:01:28.280> perfect

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
the same direction but not too perfect

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.210 
the same direction but not too perfect
dagger<00:01:29.600> strikes<00:01:29.990> back<00:01:30.440> this<00:01:30.650> way<00:01:30.860> dagger

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
dagger strikes back this way dagger

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.219 
dagger strikes back this way dagger
strokes<00:01:31.550> back<00:01:31.850> that<00:01:32.090> way<00:01:32.240> it<00:01:32.390> may<00:01:32.600> be<00:01:32.659> easier

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
strokes back that way it may be easier

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.230 
strokes back that way it may be easier
to<00:01:33.800> hold<00:01:33.950> your<00:01:34.250> airbrush<00:01:34.640> on<00:01:34.759> an<00:01:34.850> angle

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
to hold your airbrush on an angle

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.910 
to hold your airbrush on an angle
because<00:01:35.479> I<00:01:35.600> find<00:01:35.869> that<00:01:36.020> you<00:01:36.140> can<00:01:36.259> get<00:01:36.409> sharper

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
because I find that you can get sharper

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.649 
because I find that you can get sharper
dagger<00:01:37.130> strokes<00:01:37.460> this<00:01:37.700> way<00:01:37.850> so<00:01:38.270> let's<00:01:38.450> finish

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
dagger strokes this way so let's finish

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:41.680 
dagger strokes this way so let's finish
the<00:01:38.930> exercise<00:01:39.350> sheet<00:01:40.090> you<00:01:41.090> always<00:01:41.300> get<00:01:41.659> a

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
the exercise sheet you always get a

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.530 
the exercise sheet you always get a
better<00:01:41.899> result<00:01:42.380> when<00:01:43.159> you<00:01:43.550> blend<00:01:44.360> your

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
better result when you blend your

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.100 
better result when you blend your
effects<00:01:45.050> out<00:01:45.229> from<00:01:45.560> the<00:01:45.680> darkest<00:01:46.100> area<00:01:46.460> and<00:01:47.110> to

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
effects out from the darkest area and to

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.320 
effects out from the darkest area and to
finish<00:01:48.440> off<00:01:48.619> hair<00:01:48.860> texture<00:01:49.280> I<00:01:49.460> always<00:01:49.909> like<00:01:50.149> to

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
finish off hair texture I always like to

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.870 
finish off hair texture I always like to
go<00:01:50.479> over<00:01:50.509> it<00:01:50.960> with<00:01:51.170> a<00:01:51.530> series<00:01:51.979> of<00:01:52.009> super<00:01:52.610> fine

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
go over it with a series of super fine

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.719 
go over it with a series of super fine
lines<00:01:53.270> so<00:01:53.720> go<00:01:53.929> far<00:01:54.229> and<00:01:54.530> pull<00:01:54.800> back<00:01:55.009> say

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
lines so go far and pull back say

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:59.800 
lines so go far and pull back say
halfway<00:01:56.030> on<00:01:56.360> the<00:01:56.479> trigger<00:01:58.420> and<00:01:59.420> that's<00:01:59.570> hair

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
halfway on the trigger and that's hair

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.719 
halfway on the trigger and that's hair
texture<00:02:00.200> complete<00:02:00.560> and<00:02:00.740> now<00:02:01.009> for<00:02:01.310> wrinkles

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
texture complete and now for wrinkles

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.690 
texture complete and now for wrinkles
why<00:02:02.179> do<00:02:02.240> we<00:02:02.390> call<00:02:02.630> them<00:02:02.780> micro<00:02:03.080> shapes<00:02:03.710> because

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
why do we call them micro shapes because

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.330 
why do we call them micro shapes because
really<00:02:05.149> all<00:02:05.360> wrinkles<00:02:05.840> are<00:02:05.990> is<00:02:06.259> a<00:02:06.740> series<00:02:07.310> of

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
really all wrinkles are is a series of

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.880 
really all wrinkles are is a series of
small<00:02:07.700> blend<00:02:08.239> merging<00:02:08.959> together<00:02:09.320> it's<00:02:09.769> not

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
small blend merging together it's not

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.070

well<00:02:25.480> at<00:02:26.480> the<00:02:26.690> edge<00:02:26.840> of<00:02:27.049> every<00:02:27.410> shadow<00:02:27.709> is<00:02:28.610> a

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
well at the edge of every shadow is a

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.949 
well at the edge of every shadow is a
highlight<00:02:29.209> so<00:02:29.870> for<00:02:30.079> example<00:02:30.500> this<00:02:30.620> line<00:02:30.860> here

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
highlight so for example this line here

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.870 
highlight so for example this line here
blends<00:02:32.959> out<00:02:33.110> in<00:02:33.500> that<00:02:33.650> direction<00:02:34.010> there's<00:02:34.820> a

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
blends out in that direction there's a

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.420 
blends out in that direction there's a
highlight<00:02:35.380> directly<00:02:36.380> on<00:02:36.500> this<00:02:36.650> side<00:02:36.890> as<00:02:37.130> you

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
highlight directly on this side as you

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:43.039 
highlight directly on this side as you
can<00:02:37.579> see<00:02:37.760> in<00:02:37.880> the<00:02:38.000> reference

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:46.470 

so<00:02:44.049> to<00:02:44.140> finish<00:02:44.409> off<00:02:44.709> the<00:02:44.859> wrinkles<00:02:45.250> all<00:02:45.670> I<00:02:45.730> have

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
so to finish off the wrinkles all I have

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.209 
so to finish off the wrinkles all I have
done<00:02:46.719> is<00:02:46.959> gone<00:02:47.200> over<00:02:47.530> with<00:02:47.680> a<00:02:47.709> little<00:02:47.829> bit<00:02:48.099> of

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:48.219 
done is gone over with a little bit of

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:50.160 
done is gone over with a little bit of
figure<00:02:48.519> 8<00:02:48.640> texture<00:02:49.030> you<00:02:49.390> can<00:02:49.540> see<00:02:49.750> how<00:02:49.930> light

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
figure 8 texture you can see how light

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.979 
figure 8 texture you can see how light
it<00:02:50.409> is<00:02:50.560> or<00:02:50.980> not<00:02:51.040> see<00:02:51.489> how<00:02:51.670> light<00:02:51.879> of<00:02:52.000> this<00:02:52.120> sort

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
it is or not see how light of this sort

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.289 
it is or not see how light of this sort
of<00:02:53.049> line<00:02:53.200> so<00:02:53.650> let's<00:02:53.829> take<00:02:54.040> a<00:02:54.069> look<00:02:54.760> at<00:02:55.060> a<00:02:55.120> good

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
of line so let's take a look at a good

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:57.089 
of line so let's take a look at a good
example<00:02:55.359> of<00:02:55.870> where<00:02:56.139> hair<00:02:56.439> texture<00:02:56.829> might<00:02:56.980> be

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:57.099 
example of where hair texture might be

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:58.860 
example of where hair texture might be
used<00:02:57.310> is<00:02:57.700> a<00:02:57.760> little<00:02:58.120> something<00:02:58.420> I've<00:02:58.540> prepared

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
used is a little something I've prepared

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.349 
used is a little something I've prepared
earlier<00:02:59.310> so<00:03:00.310> you<00:03:00.370> can<00:03:00.549> see<00:03:00.700> I've<00:03:00.849> just<00:03:00.879> on<00:03:01.239> the

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:01.359 
earlier so you can see I've just on the

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:03.270 
earlier so you can see I've just on the
basic<00:03:01.780> shapes<00:03:02.079> of<00:03:02.379> the<00:03:02.500> head<00:03:02.680> the<00:03:02.859> darkest

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
basic shapes of the head the darkest

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.250 
basic shapes of the head the darkest
areas<00:03:03.639> not<00:03:03.969> so<00:03:04.120> much<00:03:04.299> here<00:03:04.510> you'll<00:03:04.750> see<00:03:04.930> me<00:03:05.079> do

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
areas not so much here you'll see me do

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.530 
areas not so much here you'll see me do
that<00:03:05.290> however<00:03:05.920> I<00:03:06.069> really<00:03:06.459> just<00:03:06.849> have<00:03:07.060> to<00:03:07.090> go<00:03:07.359> in

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
that however I really just have to go in

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:13.740 
that however I really just have to go in
and<00:03:07.750> add<00:03:08.019> the<00:03:08.200> detail<00:03:08.650> to<00:03:08.859> the<00:03:08.950> head

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:21.750
