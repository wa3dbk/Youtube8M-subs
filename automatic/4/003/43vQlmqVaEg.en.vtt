00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
just I like the bulkiness of the xbox

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.399 
just I like the bulkiness of the xbox
controller<00:01:58.950> sometimes<00:01:59.579> my<00:02:00.329> hands<00:02:00.750> do<00:02:00.930> her<00:02:01.170> and

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
controller sometimes my hands do her and

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.230 
controller sometimes my hands do her and
when<00:02:01.649> I<00:02:01.680> really<00:02:01.979> focus<00:02:02.340> on<00:02:02.460> like<00:02:02.640> my<00:02:02.790> hands<00:02:03.149> on

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
when I really focus on like my hands on

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.389 
when I really focus on like my hands on
the<00:02:03.329> controller<00:02:03.689> I<00:02:03.780> feel<00:02:04.170> like<00:02:04.320> weird<00:02:04.740> but

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
the controller I feel like weird but

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.459 
the controller I feel like weird but
it's<00:02:05.520> even<00:02:05.759> weirder<00:02:06.060> with<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.570> xbox<00:02:06.990> way<00:02:07.259> with

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
it's even weirder with the xbox way with

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.169 
it's even weirder with the xbox way with
the<00:02:07.590> ps3<00:02:08.099> controller<00:02:08.489> and<00:02:08.640> I<00:02:08.670> know<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.940> ps4

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
the ps3 controller and I know the ps4

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.609 
the ps3 controller and I know the ps4
one<00:02:09.569> is<00:02:09.690> going<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:09.959> be<00:02:10.050> a<00:02:10.080> little<00:02:10.229> bit<00:02:10.349> bigger

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
one is going to be a little bit bigger

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.570 
one is going to be a little bit bigger
but<00:02:10.800> it<00:02:10.950> still<00:02:11.160> has<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.340> same<00:02:11.730> design

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
but it still has the same design

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.220 
but it still has the same design
so<00:02:12.820> that's<00:02:12.970> the<00:02:13.150> main<00:02:13.330> that's<00:02:13.720> one<00:02:14.050> of<00:02:14.140> the

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
so that's the main that's one of the

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.080 
so that's the main that's one of the
main<00:02:14.470> reasons<00:02:14.860> is<00:02:15.070> the<00:02:15.370> the<00:02:15.580> controller<00:02:15.970> I

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
main reasons is the the controller I
