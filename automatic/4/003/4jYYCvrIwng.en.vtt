00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:42.719 
so straight downwards and I just work in

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:47.059 
so straight downwards and I just work in
large<00:01:43.049> sections<00:01:45.380> wrapping<00:01:46.380> away<00:01:46.649> from<00:01:46.920> your

00:01:47.059 --> 00:01:47.069 
large sections wrapping away from your

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.080 
face and it doesn't have to be me or
anything<00:01:51.959> so<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.560> just<00:01:52.979> take<00:01:53.189> any<00:01:53.640> random

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
anything so I just take any random

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.969 
anything so I just take any random
sections<00:01:54.569> I<00:01:54.780> don't<00:01:54.929> section<00:01:55.380> off<00:01:55.500> my<00:01:55.679> hair<00:01:55.859> at

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.969 
sections I don't section off my hair at
all<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.750> sometimes<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:58.289> sections<00:01:58.709> are<00:01:58.829> bear

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
all and sometimes the sections are bear

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.010 
all and sometimes the sections are bear
sometimes<00:01:59.429> sections<00:02:00.149> are<00:02:00.359> smaller<00:02:00.599> and<00:02:00.899> it

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
sometimes sections are smaller and it

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:07.399 
sometimes sections are smaller and it
all<00:02:01.229> adds<00:02:01.289> to<00:02:02.099> that<00:02:02.539> messy<00:02:03.539> beachy<00:02:04.530> look<00:02:06.409> you

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
all adds to that messy beachy look you

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.499 
all adds to that messy beachy look you
can<00:02:07.530> also<00:02:07.679> go<00:02:08.039> back<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.549> curl<00:02:09.030> any<00:02:09.209> pieces

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
can also go back and curl any pieces

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.330 
can also go back and curl any pieces
that<00:02:09.840> you<00:02:09.869> think<00:02:10.200> are<00:02:10.349> too<00:02:10.530> straight<00:02:10.950> but

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
that you think are too straight but

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.850 
that you think are too straight but

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
really it's not supposed to be defined

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.600 
really it's not supposed to be defined
curls<00:02:14.280> just<00:02:14.480> big<00:02:15.480> waves<00:02:15.870> so<00:02:16.370> you<00:02:17.370> don't<00:02:17.549> have

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
curls just big waves so you don't have

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.490 
curls just big waves so you don't have
to<00:02:17.790> worry<00:02:17.940> about<00:02:18.060> getting<00:02:18.360> every<00:02:18.870> single

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
to worry about getting every single

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:32.530 
to worry about getting every single
piece<00:02:19.650> of<00:02:19.709> your<00:02:20.040> hair

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.410 

and<00:02:33.019> this<00:02:33.769> is<00:02:33.950> what<00:02:34.129> it<00:02:34.250> looks<00:02:34.489> like<00:02:34.730> we<00:02:35.090> have

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420
