00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
this is uh there's a couple of

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:02.089 
this is uh there's a couple of
manufacturers<00:04:01.139> that<00:04:01.169> make<00:04:01.349> holsters<00:04:01.769> similar

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:02.099 
manufacturers that make holsters similar

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:03.589 
manufacturers that make holsters similar
to<00:04:02.220> this<00:04:02.310> and<00:04:02.489> I<00:04:02.519> really<00:04:02.790> like<00:04:03.120> these<00:04:03.359> type<00:04:03.569> of

holsters<00:04:04.079> and<00:04:04.260> they<00:04:04.319> talked<00:04:05.010> about<00:04:05.160> the<00:04:05.400> fact

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
holsters and they talked about the fact

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:07.580 
holsters and they talked about the fact
that<00:04:05.700> it<00:04:06.090> has<00:04:06.329> this<00:04:06.569> kind<00:04:06.750> of<00:04:06.870> class<00:04:07.230> but<00:04:07.530> I

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
that it has this kind of class but I

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.430 
that it has this kind of class but I
really<00:04:07.889> like<00:04:08.040> this<00:04:08.250> class<00:04:08.489> because<00:04:09.209> if<00:04:10.049> you're

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
really like this class because if you're

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.110 
really like this class because if you're
there's<00:04:10.829> some<00:04:10.919> other<00:04:11.040> cases<00:04:11.280> that<00:04:11.459> is<00:04:11.730> you<00:04:11.910> put

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
there's some other cases that is you put

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.089 
there's some other cases that is you put
the<00:04:12.209> phone<00:04:12.389> in<00:04:12.540> if<00:04:12.720> you've<00:04:12.840> been<00:04:13.049> down<00:04:13.230> this

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099 
the phone in if you've been down this

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:17.180 
the phone in if you've been down this
could<00:04:14.430> slide<00:04:14.730> up<00:04:14.910> or<00:04:15.120> if<00:04:16.109> you<00:04:16.500> have<00:04:16.769> your<00:04:16.950> case

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
could slide up or if you have your case

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.430 
could slide up or if you have your case
this<00:04:17.760> way<00:04:17.970> so<00:04:18.030> that<00:04:18.329> you<00:04:18.510> don't<00:04:19.169> have<00:04:19.320> this

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
this way so that you don't have this

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.830 
this way so that you don't have this
giant<00:04:19.859> phone<00:04:20.099> hanging<00:04:21.090> down<00:04:21.239> from<00:04:21.269> your<00:04:21.599> hip

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
giant phone hanging down from your hip

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.690 
giant phone hanging down from your hip
you<00:04:22.650> don't<00:04:22.830> really<00:04:22.919> have<00:04:23.099> to<00:04:23.250> worry<00:04:23.400> about<00:04:23.520> it

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
you don't really have to worry about it

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.310 
you don't really have to worry about it
it's<00:04:23.849> sliding<00:04:24.180> out<00:04:24.300> and<00:04:24.570> that's<00:04:24.960> because<00:04:25.200> it

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
it's sliding out and that's because it

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.840 
it's sliding out and that's because it
has<00:04:25.440> you<00:04:25.830> put<00:04:26.070> in<00:04:26.219> your<00:04:26.550> phone

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
no you have this enlarge that it snaps

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.360 
no you have this enlarge that it snaps
in<00:04:29.730> it<00:04:30.390> will<00:04:30.570> not<00:04:30.780> come<00:04:31.020> out<00:04:31.170> so<00:04:31.470> if<00:04:32.040> you<00:04:32.100> notice

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370

if I try to pull it out it won't come
out<00:04:34.980> it<00:04:35.640> literally<00:04:35.940> would<00:04:36.150> have<00:04:36.390> to<00:04:36.690> snap<00:04:37.260> from

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
out it literally would have to snap from

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.510 
out it literally would have to snap from
from<00:04:38.700> the<00:04:38.910> holster<00:04:39.240> arm<00:04:39.690> here<00:04:40.290> from<00:04:41.100> your<00:04:41.280> belt

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
for it to come out if you let's say were

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.230 
for it to come out if you let's say were
to<00:04:45.810> bend<00:04:46.770> out<00:04:46.980> for<00:04:47.250> a<00:04:47.280> second<00:04:47.640> and<00:04:47.790> something

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
to bend out for a second and something

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.400 
to bend out for a second and something
were<00:04:48.330> to<00:04:48.390> push<00:04:48.630> up<00:04:48.840> and<00:04:48.990> you<00:04:49.080> wouldn't<00:04:49.290> notice

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
were to push up and you wouldn't notice

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.770 
were to push up and you wouldn't notice
you<00:04:49.740> notice<00:04:50.460> what<00:04:50.640> happens<00:04:51.000> here<00:04:51.090> as<00:04:51.510> I'm

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
you notice what happens here as I'm

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.720 
you notice what happens here as I'm
pushing<00:04:52.110> up<00:04:52.230> you<00:04:52.890> notice<00:04:53.040> how<00:04:53.250> that<00:04:53.310> gives<00:04:53.580> a

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:53.730 
pushing up you notice how that gives a

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:55.370 
pushing up you notice how that gives a
little<00:04:53.880> bit<00:04:54.030> and<00:04:54.870> that's<00:04:55.020> because<00:04:55.260> of<00:04:55.320> that

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
little bit and that's because of that

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.440 
little bit and that's because of that
little<00:04:55.620> spring<00:04:55.890> that's<00:04:56.130> there<00:04:56.430> it<00:04:56.850> won't<00:04:57.090> come

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.450 
little spring that's there it won't come

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.930 
little spring that's there it won't come
out<00:04:57.570> it<00:04:57.750> will<00:04:57.840> never<00:04:58.080> pop<00:04:58.350> out<00:04:58.500> so<00:04:59.130> I've<00:04:59.670> been

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
out it will never pop out so I've been

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.000 
out it will never pop out so I've been
looking<00:05:00.720> at<00:05:00.840> these<00:05:00.930> cases<00:05:01.260> from<00:05:01.560> various

without a problem at all snapping it in
what<00:05:22.320> I<00:05:22.350> love<00:05:22.560> about<00:05:22.680> it<00:05:22.980> too<00:05:23.010> is<00:05:23.190> that<00:05:23.400> you<00:05:23.520> get

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:23.670 
what I love about it too is that you get

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:25.880 
what I love about it too is that you get
that<00:05:23.910> feedback<00:05:24.210> so<00:05:24.990> if<00:05:25.170> I<00:05:25.290> put<00:05:25.560> it<00:05:25.680> I<00:05:25.740> don't

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:25.890 
that feedback so if I put it I don't
