00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.810
 comic spiderman got 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.820
 practically to all spheres of the industry 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:13.070
 entertainment and today we'll talk about 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.070
 figurines namely marvel legends series 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:22.240
 legends perhaps the largest line 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.430
 figures on marvel universe i want 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.590
 talk about those coming out now 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.440
 currently we have 10 figure people 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.930
 spider and again spiderman 2 electro 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:35.470
 from there superior spiderman 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:37.090
 carnage boomerang toxin beetle female 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.670
 spider and black cat 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:42.190
 but box 9 and I said that the figures 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.800
 10 the fact is that with each character 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.320
 goes the integral part of the green goblin and 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.910
 that's the problem goblin consists of 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.120
 six pieces and figures 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.680
 again 9 and here it appears 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.930
 variability can be collected six 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.479
 heroes that will be mandatory 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.460
 spiders and electro otherwise we can 

00:00:58.479 --> 00:01:03.280
 choose between black female cat 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.409
 spider carnage we toxin and beetle 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.870
 boomerang on the one hand it is convenient 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:10.479
 because between beetles were rank 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.790
 the choice is obvious but on the other hand if 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:15.370
 collect and all those who get extra 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.290
 goblin pieces they are pretty big yes and 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.870
 hardly needed for replacement 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.729
 let's go to the figures and so man 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.950
 the spider is made based on the costumes of 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:26.530
 the second movie set also go two 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.110
 hand fist variations and branded goat 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.180
 the figure is generally good but buyers 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.039
 It is worth only because of the goblins because 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.590
 there are figures of a classic spider 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:37.539
 performed much better with some 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:41.799
 angles look good with some y 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:43.780
 god thats 50 by 50 electro boxes 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:46.030
 looked worse than in the hands of painting 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.909
 the costume is depressing but the performance pleases and 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:52.210
 the forms are bundled with sparkling hands and 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:55.719
 head head way about a hundred looks 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:58.390
 the figure itself is a very black cat 

00:01:55.719 --> 00:02:00.729
 I like her heels and hairstyle though 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.109
 hair almost completely kill 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.499
 head articulation 

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:07.770
 hefty tits all as it should be 

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:11.140
 The kit is some kind of whip cat 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.060
 super spiderman second version costumes 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.470
 superior and since 1 is not much 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.600
 different from the classics 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.360
 there is a difference between the spider from 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.310
 movie from comics have superior hands 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.170
 big bends it stronger 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.540
 bundled go hands in which you can 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.060
 something to fit and branded Cossack 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.760
 ultimate spider-man beetle 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.620
 a great figure of armor gleams though 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.050
 painting on the eyes for example pretty 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.950
 crappy kit go wings it 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.200
 very cool 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.180
 it is very different from the classic 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.700
 beetle so if you do not know who is 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.430
 tooth ultimate then read the plot of the war 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.099
 symbiots article symbiote carnage 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.900
 It is made, apparently by the cartoon of the 90s 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:52.090
 because his legs are slop and 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.310
 looks like spider boots while 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.920
 it takes you like he had claws 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:59.470
 the figure itself is gorgeous head and arms higher 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.230
 all praise of the bundle go pentacles 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.660
 which are inserted in the back 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.700
 I have no other figures yet, but they 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.799
 not needed to collect the best 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.599
 green goblin stick figure series 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:12.910
 from the ultimate spider-man universe 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:15.489
 huge figurine included 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:18.130
 removable flame on arms and back looks 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:20.709
 very cool and very similar at last 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.920
 the articulation is just gorgeous so this 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:24.849
 just the perfect figure is the biggest in 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.940
 my collection 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:30.160
 And finally, this series is worth buying 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.840
 especially if you are a collector for 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.940
 so that you are completely convinced of this 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.780

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.780

 Well, you had Dima, then it was 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:16.849
 a kind of amphibious additional issue 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.849
