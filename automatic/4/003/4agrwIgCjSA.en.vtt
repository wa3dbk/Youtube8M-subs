hey<00:00:15.549> this<00:00:15.789> is<00:00:15.940> Andrew<00:00:16.330> over<00:00:16.570> at<00:00:16.660> turbo<00:00:17.020> ace<00:00:17.199> and

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:17.439 
hey this is Andrew over at turbo ace and

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:18.450 
hey this is Andrew over at turbo ace and
I'm<00:00:17.500> going<00:00:17.680> to<00:00:17.710> show<00:00:17.890> you<00:00:17.949> the<00:00:18.160> different

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:18.460 
I'm going to show you the different

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.580 
I'm going to show you the different
operating<00:00:18.880> modes<00:00:19.000> of<00:00:19.480> this<00:00:19.720> all<00:00:19.960> steady<00:00:20.349> 5

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:20.590 
operating modes of this all steady 5

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.830 
operating modes of this all steady 5
gimble<00:00:21.099> the<00:00:21.789> first<00:00:22.060> mode<00:00:22.360> you<00:00:22.509> click<00:00:22.720> the

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:22.840 
gimble the first mode you click the

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.550 
gimble the first mode you click the
joystick<00:00:23.230> once<00:00:24.810> there<00:00:25.810> we<00:00:25.930> go<00:00:26.079> that's<00:00:26.320> full

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:26.560 
joystick once there we go that's full

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.830 
joystick once there we go that's full
lock<00:00:26.829> mode<00:00:27.160> so<00:00:27.759> you<00:00:27.789> can<00:00:28.000> see<00:00:28.029> it<00:00:28.390> won't<00:00:28.539> follow

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:28.840 
lock mode so you can see it won't follow

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.679 
lock mode so you can see it won't follow
me<00:00:29.050> at<00:00:29.439> all<00:00:29.650> no<00:00:30.579> matter<00:00:30.700> what<00:00:31.029> I<00:00:31.059> do<00:00:31.210> it's<00:00:31.540> a

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:31.689 
me at all no matter what I do it's a

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.010 
me at all no matter what I do it's a
steady<00:00:32.020> one<00:00:32.829> direction<00:00:33.399> or<00:00:33.820> that<00:00:33.879> lens<00:00:34.239> the

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:35.020 
steady one direction or that lens the

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.160 
steady one direction or that lens the
second<00:00:35.410> mode<00:00:35.530> I<00:00:35.559> hit<00:00:35.770> it<00:00:35.800> twice

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
second mode I hit it twice

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.380 
second mode I hit it twice
that's<00:00:38.170> pan<00:00:38.530> follow<00:00:38.910> so<00:00:39.910> you<00:00:40.000> can<00:00:40.149> see<00:00:40.270> it's

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.390 
that's pan follow so you can see it's

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.500 
that's pan follow so you can see it's
going<00:00:40.510> to<00:00:40.600> follow<00:00:40.809> just<00:00:41.590> pan<00:00:41.980> movements<00:00:42.550> not

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
going to follow just pan movements not

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:49.950 
going to follow just pan movements not
the<00:00:43.750> role<00:00:43.960> for<00:00:44.739> the<00:00:44.800> tilts<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:49.510> next<00:00:49.780> three

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
the role for the tilts the next three

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.200 
the role for the tilts the next three
modes<00:00:50.200> are<00:00:50.530> essentially<00:00:51.520> the<00:00:51.640> same<00:00:51.850> except

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
modes are essentially the same except

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.540 
modes are essentially the same except
for<00:00:52.239> different<00:00:52.630> speeds<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:54.070> it's<00:00:54.250> a<00:00:54.340> full

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:54.550 
for different speeds and it's a full

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.560 
for different speeds and it's a full
follow<00:00:54.820> mode<00:00:55.120> so<00:00:55.450> I'll<00:00:55.540> show<00:00:55.750> you<00:00:55.780> mode<00:00:56.200> 3<00:00:57.570> it's

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
follow mode so I'll show you mode 3 it's

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.930 
follow mode so I'll show you mode 3 it's
a<00:00:58.660> slow<00:00:59.050> full<00:00:59.710> follow<00:01:00.070> so<00:01:00.430> you<00:01:00.520> can<00:01:00.670> get<00:01:00.760> that

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
a slow full follow so you can get that

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.850 
a slow full follow so you can get that
real<00:01:01.180> nice<00:01:01.360> cinematic<00:01:02.140> look<00:01:02.380> and<00:01:02.620> you<00:01:02.739> can

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:02.860 
real nice cinematic look and you can

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.850 
real nice cinematic look and you can
even<00:01:03.220> tilt<00:01:04.210> it<00:01:04.420> up<00:01:04.629> whatever<00:01:05.170> you<00:01:05.409> want<00:01:05.560> to<00:01:05.680> do

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
even tilt it up whatever you want to do

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.429 
even tilt it up whatever you want to do
and<00:01:06.100> then<00:01:06.909> I'll<00:01:07.030> show<00:01:07.210> you<00:01:07.240> the<00:01:07.630> range<00:01:07.990> of<00:01:08.259> that

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:08.439 
and then I'll show you the range of that

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:12.389 
and then I'll show you the range of that
this<00:01:09.130> is<00:01:09.159> 5<00:01:09.610> this<00:01:09.909> is<00:01:09.969> the<00:01:10.210> faster<00:01:10.659> mode<00:01:11.280> so<00:01:12.280> you

00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:12.399 
this is 5 this is the faster mode so you

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:13.980 
this is 5 this is the faster mode so you
can<00:01:12.579> see<00:01:12.759> it<00:01:12.880> follows<00:01:13.270> my<00:01:13.390> movements<00:01:13.420> much

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
can see it follows my movements much

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.539 
can see it follows my movements much
faster

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:22.029 

so<00:01:20.180> the<00:01:20.270> next<00:01:20.450> couple<00:01:20.869> of<00:01:21.140> modes<00:01:21.439> of<00:01:21.530> operation

00:01:22.029 --> 00:01:22.039 
so the next couple of modes of operation

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:23.319 
so the next couple of modes of operation
I'm<00:01:22.130> going<00:01:22.280> to<00:01:22.340> show<00:01:22.520> you<00:01:22.549> how<00:01:22.850> to<00:01:22.880> do<00:01:23.090> with<00:01:23.210> how

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:23.329 
I'm going to show you how to do with how

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:25.810 
I'm going to show you how to do with how
I'm<00:01:23.450> holding<00:01:23.689> the<00:01:23.990> gimbal<00:01:24.320> go<00:01:25.280> into<00:01:25.490> mode<00:01:25.640> -

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
I'm holding the gimbal go into mode -

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.050 
I'm holding the gimbal go into mode -
for<00:01:26.060> this<00:01:26.920> this<00:01:27.920> is<00:01:27.979> the<00:01:28.219> standard<00:01:28.670> mode<00:01:28.850> this

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
for this this is the standard mode this

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.550 
for this this is the standard mode this
is<00:01:29.090> what<00:01:29.299> everyone<00:01:29.659> knows<00:01:29.840> right<00:01:30.079> here<00:01:30.350> I<00:01:30.380> got

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
is what everyone knows right here I got

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.219 
is what everyone knows right here I got
my<00:01:30.619> hands<00:01:30.920> out<00:01:31.070> here<00:01:31.450> got<00:01:32.450> a<00:01:32.509> lot<00:01:32.689> of<00:01:32.810> range<00:01:33.020> for

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
my hands out here got a lot of range for

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.889 
my hands out here got a lot of range for
my<00:01:33.319> shop<00:01:33.789> the<00:01:34.789> next<00:01:35.030> one<00:01:35.179> is<00:01:35.299> if<00:01:35.420> I<00:01:35.539> want<00:01:35.719> to<00:01:35.810> get

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:35.899 
my shop the next one is if I want to get

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:38.889 
my shop the next one is if I want to get
down<00:01:36.079> low<00:01:36.409> so<00:01:36.850> you<00:01:37.850> have<00:01:37.939> this<00:01:38.060> handle<00:01:38.479> here<00:01:38.689> if

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:38.899 
down low so you have this handle here if

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:39.669 
down low so you have this handle here if
I<00:01:38.990> want<00:01:39.140> to<00:01:39.200> get<00:01:39.289> low

00:01:39.669 --> 00:01:39.679 
I want to get low

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:42.309 
I want to get low
sometimes<00:01:40.039> my<00:01:40.250> knee<00:01:40.750> will<00:01:41.750> actually<00:01:42.049> get<00:01:42.200> in

00:01:42.309 --> 00:01:42.319 
sometimes my knee will actually get in

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:43.749 
sometimes my knee will actually get in
the<00:01:42.409> way<00:01:42.560> here<00:01:42.920> and<00:01:43.009> I<00:01:43.100> don't<00:01:43.159> like<00:01:43.369> that<00:01:43.579> so

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
the way here and I don't like that so

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:45.520 
the way here and I don't like that so
I'm<00:01:43.850> gonna<00:01:44.000> go<00:01:44.119> into<00:01:44.299> briefcase<00:01:44.539> mode<00:01:45.140> so<00:01:45.409> what

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
I'm gonna go into briefcase mode so what

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.669 
I'm gonna go into briefcase mode so what
I'm<00:01:45.649> gonna<00:01:45.770> do<00:01:46.039> is<00:01:46.250> take<00:01:46.549> it<00:01:47.319> spin<00:01:48.319> it<00:01:48.350> to<00:01:48.590> the

00:01:48.669 --> 00:01:48.679 
I'm gonna do is take it spin it to the

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:51.969 
I'm gonna do is take it spin it to the
right<00:01:48.860> here<00:01:49.100> over<00:01:49.310> by<00:01:49.340> the<00:01:49.490> joystick<00:01:50.979> make

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
right here over by the joystick make

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:53.350 
right here over by the joystick make
sure<00:01:52.130> you're<00:01:52.280> in<00:01:52.399> mode<00:01:52.579> -<00:01:52.789> when<00:01:52.970> you<00:01:53.060> do<00:01:53.179> this

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
sure you're in mode - when you do this

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.929 
sure you're in mode - when you do this
and<00:01:54.049> here<00:01:54.619> we<00:01:54.739> go<00:01:54.860> now<00:01:55.069> I<00:01:55.130> can<00:01:55.310> get<00:01:55.429> that<00:01:55.610> lower

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:55.939 
and here we go now I can get that lower

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:59.710 
and here we go now I can get that lower
shot<00:01:56.420> still<00:01:57.319> got<00:01:57.500> the<00:01:57.619> follow<00:01:57.890> and<00:01:58.420> I<00:01:59.420> can<00:01:59.569> even

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
shot still got the follow and I can even

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.460 
shot still got the follow and I can even
adjust<00:01:59.929> the<00:02:00.409> tilt<00:02:00.619> with<00:02:00.829> the<00:02:00.860> joystick<00:02:01.429> here

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:05.470 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:07.539 

the<00:02:06.470> next<00:02:06.679> moment<00:02:07.099> I'm<00:02:07.159> going<00:02:07.250> to<00:02:07.310> show<00:02:07.520> you

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
the next moment I'm going to show you

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:08.859 
the next moment I'm going to show you
the<00:02:07.759> next<00:02:07.909> two<00:02:08.149> are<00:02:08.329> actually<00:02:08.599> to<00:02:08.690> get<00:02:08.780> up

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
the next two are actually to get up

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.880 
the next two are actually to get up
higher<00:02:09.110> so<00:02:09.849> still<00:02:10.849> in<00:02:11.150> mode<00:02:11.360> -<00:02:11.739> I'm<00:02:12.739> actually

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890

joystick and then for this final mode I
actually<00:02:24.650> need<00:02:25.069> to<00:02:25.100> go<00:02:25.400> into<00:02:26.000> one<00:02:26.840> of<00:02:26.870> the<00:02:26.989> full

actually need to go into one of the full
falling<00:02:27.590> mode<00:02:27.739> so<00:02:27.920> I'm<00:02:28.010> going<00:02:28.130> to<00:02:28.190> go<00:02:28.280> into

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
falling mode so I'm going to go into

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:38.960 
falling mode so I'm going to go into
floor<00:02:31.810> ok<00:02:32.810> turn<00:02:33.380> it<00:02:33.590> around<00:02:33.709> towards<00:02:34.459> me

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970

in post-production there you go those

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.290 
in post-production there you go those
are<00:02:56.470> the<00:02:56.890> operating<00:02:57.520> modes<00:02:57.760> of<00:02:58.030> them<00:02:58.150> all
