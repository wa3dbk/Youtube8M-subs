open the packaging and we'll see what
the<00:00:24.330> yin-yang<00:00:25.019> case<00:00:25.350> is<00:00:25.619> all<00:00:25.830> about<00:00:25.859> now

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
the yin-yang case is all about now

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.609 
the yin-yang case is all about now
there's<00:00:27.090> nothing<00:00:27.210> inside<00:00:27.570> your<00:00:28.109> other<00:00:28.349> than

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
there's nothing inside your other than

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.070 
there's nothing inside your other than
the<00:00:29.010> case<00:00:29.250> itself<00:00:29.670> you<00:00:30.240> do<00:00:30.390> not<00:00:30.539> get<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.810> screen

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
the case itself you do not get a screen

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.139 
the case itself you do not get a screen
shield<00:00:31.230> but<00:00:31.590> on<00:00:31.830> guard<00:00:32.279> does<00:00:32.489> make<00:00:32.790> screen

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
shield but on guard does make screen

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.030 
shield but on guard does make screen
shields<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:33.630> I've<00:00:33.719> actually<00:00:33.870> reviewed<00:00:34.440> some

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
shields and I've actually reviewed some

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.830 
shields and I've actually reviewed some
of<00:00:35.100> their<00:00:35.370> screen<00:00:35.820> shields<00:00:36.120> before<00:00:36.450> so<00:00:36.660> if<00:00:36.780> you

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
of their screen shields before so if you

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.720 
of their screen shields before so if you
need<00:00:37.020> one<00:00:37.050> you<00:00:37.620> like<00:00:37.770> this<00:00:37.950> case<00:00:38.190> you<00:00:38.370> can<00:00:38.520> pick

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
need one you like this case you can pick

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.110 
need one you like this case you can pick
one<00:00:39.120> up<00:00:39.149> at<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.690> same<00:00:39.870> time<00:00:40.219> so<00:00:41.219> as<00:00:41.430> I<00:00:41.730> kind<00:00:42.030> of

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
one up at the same time so as I kind of

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.670 
one up at the same time so as I kind of
pull<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.480> case<00:00:42.660> apart<00:00:43.050> you'll<00:00:43.260> take<00:00:43.469> note

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
pull the case apart you'll take note

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.580 
pull the case apart you'll take note
that<00:00:43.890> this<00:00:43.980> is<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.160> hybrid<00:00:44.579> style<00:00:45.000> case

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
that this is a hybrid style case

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.170 
that this is a hybrid style case
composed<00:00:46.590> of<00:00:46.860> two<00:00:47.160> different<00:00:47.370> materials<00:00:48.000> you

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
composed of two different materials you

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.049 
composed of two different materials you
have<00:00:48.210> an<00:00:48.510> inner<00:00:48.770> softer<00:00:49.770> layer<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.280> a<00:00:50.520> harder

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
have an inner softer layer and a harder

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.750 
have an inner softer layer and a harder
plastic<00:00:51.360> exterior<00:00:52.110> shell<00:00:52.590> so<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.550> inner

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
plastic exterior shell so the inner

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.389 
plastic exterior shell so the inner
layer<00:00:54.030> which<00:00:54.300> is<00:00:54.329> TPU<00:00:55.020> is<00:00:55.260> high<00:00:55.530> gloss<00:00:55.949> and

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
layer which is TPU is high gloss and

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.029 
layer which is TPU is high gloss and
then<00:00:56.850> this<00:00:57.000> outer<00:00:57.239> plastic<00:00:57.780> frame<00:00:58.440> is<00:00:58.739> soft

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
then this outer plastic frame is soft

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.490 
then this outer plastic frame is soft
touch<00:00:59.340> so<00:01:00.030> first<00:01:00.510> step<00:01:00.690> for<00:01:00.930> installation

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
touch so first step for installation

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.170 
touch so first step for installation
it's<00:01:01.890> going<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.100> be<00:01:02.190> taking<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.550> iphone<00:01:02.910> 5<00:01:03.149> and

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
it's going to be taking the iphone 5 and

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.600 
it's going to be taking the iphone 5 and
placing<00:01:03.899> it<00:01:03.960> inside<00:01:04.140> this<00:01:04.530> soft<00:01:05.070> layer<00:01:05.400> like

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
placing it inside this soft layer like

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.730 
placing it inside this soft layer like
so<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.150> then<00:01:06.180> essentially<00:01:07.110> treating<00:01:07.590> this

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
so and then essentially treating this

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.770 
so and then essentially treating this
like<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:08.100> snap<00:01:08.490> on<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.790> back<00:01:08.909> style<00:01:09.150> case<00:01:09.450> so

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
like a snap on the back style case so

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.050 
like a snap on the back style case so
put<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.500> button<00:01:10.680> side<00:01:10.950> first<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.580> then<00:01:11.820> just

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
put the button side first and then just

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.210 
put the button side first and then just
click<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.360> over<00:01:12.840> like<00:01:13.020> so<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:13.920> can<00:01:14.070> see

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
click it over like so and you can see

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.969 
click it over like so and you can see
how<00:01:14.340> easy<00:01:14.610> that<00:01:14.729> installation<00:01:15.390> was<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:16.110> really

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
how easy that installation was I really

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.830 
how easy that installation was I really
like<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.310> look<00:01:17.460> of<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.790> black<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.270> red<00:01:18.509> kind

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
like the look of the black and red kind

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.510 
like the look of the black and red kind
of<00:01:18.960> devilish<00:01:19.409> looking<00:01:19.830> but<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.040> really<00:01:20.189> pops

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
of devilish looking but it really pops

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.149 
of devilish looking but it really pops
with<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.000> black<00:01:21.659> iphone<00:01:22.170> now<00:01:22.409> as<00:01:22.590> far<00:01:22.799> as<00:01:22.860> lay

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
with the black iphone now as far as lay

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.890 
with the black iphone now as far as lay
on<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.369> table<00:01:23.400> protection<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.540> do<00:01:24.689> get<00:01:24.840> a

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
on the table protection you do get a

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.600 
on the table protection you do get a
good<00:01:25.170> amount<00:01:25.290> with<00:01:25.740> this<00:01:25.950> case<00:01:26.189> you<00:01:26.430> can<00:01:26.580> see

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
good amount with this case you can see

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.749 
good amount with this case you can see
that<00:01:26.790> that<00:01:26.939> TPU<00:01:27.659> lip<00:01:27.900> does<00:01:28.500> come<00:01:28.799> up<00:01:28.979> over<00:01:29.159> onto

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
that that TPU lip does come up over onto

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.490 
that that TPU lip does come up over onto
the<00:01:29.790> glass<00:01:30.060> it<00:01:30.659> will<00:01:30.900> work<00:01:31.049> with<00:01:31.229> screen

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
the glass it will work with screen

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.289 
the glass it will work with screen
shields<00:01:31.829> just<00:01:32.070> fine<00:01:32.280> I<00:01:32.520> think<00:01:32.790> even<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.119> glass

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
shields just fine I think even the glass

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.990 
shields just fine I think even the glass
tea<00:01:33.659> should<00:01:34.350> be<00:01:34.380> okay<00:01:34.860> with<00:01:35.040> this<00:01:35.189> as<00:01:35.430> well<00:01:35.460> as

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
tea should be okay with this as well as

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.450 
tea should be okay with this as well as
far<00:01:36.659> as<00:01:36.689> all<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.200> ports<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.619> controls<00:01:37.829> is<00:01:38.310> to
