impressed<00:00:14.660> me<00:00:14.810> about<00:00:14.900> this<00:00:15.260> amplifier<00:00:15.800> is

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:15.980 
impressed me about this amplifier is

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.430 
impressed me about this amplifier is
although<00:00:16.189> it's<00:00:16.460> very<00:00:16.519> British<00:00:17.330> voiced<00:00:17.660> it<00:00:18.050> is

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:18.440 
although it's very British voiced it is

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.560 
although it's very British voiced it is
a<00:00:18.470> very<00:00:18.710> powerful<00:00:18.950> eq<00:00:19.700> section<00:00:19.940> and<00:00:20.330> you<00:00:20.420> could

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570 
a very powerful eq section and you could

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.500 
a very powerful eq section and you could
really<00:00:20.840> shape<00:00:21.200> the<00:00:21.440> tone<00:00:21.730> to<00:00:22.730> whatever<00:00:22.910> fits

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:23.510 
really shape the tone to whatever fits

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:24.970

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:20.140 

this<00:06:18.230> amplifier<00:06:18.530> is<00:06:18.920> also<00:06:19.310> capable<00:06:19.520> of<00:06:19.910> some

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:20.150 
this amplifier is also capable of some

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.750 
this amplifier is also capable of some
high<00:06:20.330> gain<00:06:20.660> lead<00:06:21.170> tones<00:06:21.500> here<00:06:22.250> we've<00:06:22.400> cranked

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:22.760 
high gain lead tones here we've cranked

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.210 
high gain lead tones here we've cranked
up<00:06:22.850> the<00:06:22.910> volume<00:06:23.510> and<00:06:23.660> master<00:06:24.560> volume<00:06:24.770> so<00:06:25.190> you

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:25.220 
up the volume and master volume so you

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:26.920 
up the volume and master volume so you
can<00:06:25.310> hear<00:06:25.460> how<00:06:25.820> much<00:06:25.970> gain<00:06:26.270> this<00:06:26.450> amp<00:06:26.690> really

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:26.930 
can hear how much gain this amp really

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:58.700 
can hear how much gain this amp really
