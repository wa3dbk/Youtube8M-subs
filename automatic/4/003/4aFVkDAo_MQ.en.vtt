and i went and I looked the description
everything<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.630> automatically<00:01:28.350> tactical

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
everything and automatically tactical

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.530 
everything and automatically tactical
mask<00:01:29.040> came<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.400> my<00:01:29.520> head<00:01:29.670> thinking<00:01:30.150> that<00:01:30.420> yeah

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
mask came to my head thinking that yeah

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.670 
mask came to my head thinking that yeah
this<00:01:30.689> would<00:01:30.810> be<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.020> best<00:01:31.200> one<00:01:31.320> that<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:31.530> can

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
this would be the best one that you can

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.039 
this would be the best one that you can
use<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:32.340> disable<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.030> but<00:01:33.210> engineer<00:01:33.869> is

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
use to disable it but engineer is

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.870 
use to disable it but engineer is
basically<00:01:34.530> like<00:01:34.560> stalker<00:01:34.979> pro<00:01:35.340> where<00:01:35.579> you<00:01:35.729> can

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
basically like stalker pro where you can

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.420 
basically like stalker pro where you can
delay<00:01:36.290> explosives<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.619> stuff<00:01:37.890> like<00:01:38.009> that<00:01:38.070> so

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
delay explosives and stuff like that so

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.969 
delay explosives and stuff like that so
shocked<00:01:39.329> charges<00:01:39.810> are<00:01:39.930> basically<00:01:40.350> explosives

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
shocked charges are basically explosives

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.440 
shocked charges are basically explosives
because<00:01:41.310> they<00:01:41.460> are<00:01:41.579> basically<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:42.030> claymore

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
because they are basically a claymore

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.289 
because they are basically a claymore
but<00:01:42.720> with<00:01:42.990> stun<00:01:43.439> grenade<00:01:43.799> qualities<00:01:44.729> into<00:01:45.030> it

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
but with stun grenade qualities into it

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.569 
but with stun grenade qualities into it
as<00:01:45.420> well<00:01:45.570> so<00:01:46.170> if<00:01:46.290> you<00:01:46.409> slap<00:01:46.619> on<00:01:46.829> engineer<00:01:47.399> as

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
as well so if you slap on engineer as

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.030 
as well so if you slap on engineer as
well<00:01:47.820> as<00:01:48.000> tactical<00:01:48.329> mask<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:49.259> have<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.829> little

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
well as tactical mask you have a little

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.740 
well as tactical mask you have a little
bit<00:01:50.220> of<00:01:50.250> extra<00:01:50.520> time<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:51.030> get<00:01:51.119> away<00:01:51.270> from<00:01:51.450> the

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
bit of extra time to get away from the

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.270 
bit of extra time to get away from the
shock<00:01:51.930> charge<00:01:52.200> when<00:01:52.409> you<00:01:52.470> run<00:01:52.619> by<00:01:52.740> it<00:01:52.799> you

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
shock charge when you run by it you

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.679 
shock charge when you run by it you
really<00:01:53.549> don't<00:01:53.700> have<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:53.909> worry<00:01:54.119> about<00:01:54.240> it<00:01:54.540> and

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
really don't have to worry about it and

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.810 
really don't have to worry about it and
then<00:01:54.990> even<00:01:55.259> if<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.439> does<00:01:55.619> does<00:01:56.040> go<00:01:56.189> off<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.670> it

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
then even if it does does go off and it

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.730 
then even if it does does go off and it
affects<00:01:57.119> you<00:01:57.299> it's<00:01:57.750> very<00:01:57.990> minimal<00:01:58.500> like<00:01:58.649> you

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
affects you it's very minimal like you

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.740 
affects you it's very minimal like you
can't<00:01:58.920> even<00:01:58.979> tell<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.579> uh<00:01:59.610> one<00:02:00.390> thing<00:02:00.570> about

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
can't even tell and uh one thing about

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:01.969 
can't even tell and uh one thing about
this<00:02:00.869> map<00:02:01.049> that's<00:02:01.259> really<00:02:01.500> cool<00:02:01.680> is<00:02:01.770> I<00:02:01.829> like

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
this map that's really cool is I like

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.530 
this map that's really cool is I like
the<00:02:02.070> train<00:02:02.280> that<00:02:02.399> goes<00:02:02.490> by<00:02:02.759> a<00:02:02.790> lot<00:02:03.119> of<00:02:03.270> people

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
the train that goes by a lot of people

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.999 
the train that goes by a lot of people
don't<00:02:03.689> like<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:03.990> but<00:02:04.140> it<00:02:04.469> does<00:02:04.710> give<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:04.979> a

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
don't like it but it does give you a

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.740 
don't like it but it does give you a
warning<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.610> when<00:02:05.820> it's<00:02:05.939> coming<00:02:06.149> so<00:02:06.420> you<00:02:06.479> can't

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
warning to when it's coming so you can't

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.730 
warning to when it's coming so you can't
get<00:02:06.840> hit<00:02:06.960> but<00:02:07.079> I<00:02:07.170> just<00:02:07.350> thought<00:02:07.439> I<00:02:07.500> throw<00:02:07.710> that

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
get hit but I just thought I throw that

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.190 
get hit but I just thought I throw that
out<00:02:07.860> there<00:02:08.039> for<00:02:08.190> some<00:02:08.310> reason<00:02:08.610> so<00:02:09.179> those<00:02:09.959> two

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
out there for some reason so those two

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.020 
out there for some reason so those two
are<00:02:10.349> really<00:02:10.530> important<00:02:11.310> because<00:02:11.400> it<00:02:11.819> does<00:02:12.000> a

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
are really important because it does a

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.520 
are really important because it does a
lot<00:02:12.239> for<00:02:12.300> you<00:02:12.720> everybody

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
aura mainly I like to play hard point

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.580 
aura mainly I like to play hard point
which<00:02:15.569> is<00:02:15.600> what<00:02:15.780> I'm<00:02:15.870> playing<00:02:16.050> here<00:02:16.290> but<00:02:16.470> it's

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
which is what I'm playing here but it's

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.410 
which is what I'm playing here but it's
a<00:02:16.650> game<00:02:16.800> mode<00:02:16.980> that<00:02:17.100> I<00:02:17.160> can<00:02:17.400> only<00:02:17.550> play<00:02:17.850> with<00:02:18.390> a

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
a game mode that I can only play with a

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.150 
a game mode that I can only play with a
full<00:02:18.660> team<00:02:18.810> I<00:02:19.020> tried<00:02:19.440> playing<00:02:19.650> earlier<00:02:20.010> today

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
full team I tried playing earlier today

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.250 
full team I tried playing earlier today
and<00:02:20.370> it's<00:02:20.520> it's<00:02:20.940> very<00:02:21.270> difficult<00:02:21.510> to<00:02:21.780> play<00:02:22.020> by

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
and it's it's very difficult to play by

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.260 
and it's it's very difficult to play by
yourself<00:02:22.380> because<00:02:22.830> nobody<00:02:23.459> is<00:02:23.610> in<00:02:23.819> game<00:02:24.000> chat

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
yourself because nobody is in game chat

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.449 
yourself because nobody is in game chat
nobody's<00:02:24.780> trying<00:02:25.050> to<00:02:25.110> win<00:02:25.290> I<00:02:25.500> really<00:02:26.310> thought

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
nobody's trying to win I really thought

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.040 
nobody's trying to win I really thought
that<00:02:26.640> black<00:02:26.850> ops<00:02:27.090> 2<00:02:27.270> would<00:02:27.510> push<00:02:28.020> the

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
that black ops 2 would push the

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.540 
that black ops 2 would push the
objective<00:02:28.590> more<00:02:28.800> but<00:02:29.010> it<00:02:29.100> seems<00:02:29.280> like<00:02:29.430> more

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
objective more but it seems like more

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.640 
objective more but it seems like more
people<00:02:29.700> just<00:02:29.970> camp<00:02:30.180> so<00:02:30.480> anyway<00:02:31.260> with<00:02:31.410> a<00:02:31.440> full

perks of use you don't really have to
use<00:03:20.310> hardline<00:03:20.730> but<00:03:21.450> i<00:03:21.690> would<00:03:21.840> suggest<00:03:22.170> it

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
use hardline but i would suggest it

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.660 
use hardline but i would suggest it
because<00:03:22.739> like<00:03:22.890> i<00:03:23.010> said<00:03:23.040> if<00:03:23.340> you're<00:03:23.400> gonna<00:03:23.519> be

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
because like i said if you're gonna be

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:24.920 
because like i said if you're gonna be
playing<00:03:23.880> the<00:03:23.970> objective<00:03:24.060> like<00:03:24.480> I<00:03:24.600> do<00:03:24.660> when

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
playing the objective like I do when

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:26.660 
playing the objective like I do when
hard<00:03:25.140> point<00:03:25.380> I'm<00:03:25.950> really<00:03:26.100> not<00:03:26.340> playing<00:03:26.579> it

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
hard point I'm really not playing it

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:27.860 
hard point I'm really not playing it
that<00:03:26.820> much<00:03:26.970> on<00:03:27.120> this<00:03:27.239> game<00:03:27.390> because<00:03:27.600> I'm

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
that much on this game because I'm

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.360 
that much on this game because I'm
playing<00:03:28.079> in<00:03:28.230> a<00:03:28.290> full<00:03:28.470> team<00:03:28.650> and<00:03:28.950> I<00:03:29.010> realized

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
playing in a full team and I realized

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.130 
playing in a full team and I realized
the<00:03:29.790> enemies<00:03:30.150> weren't<00:03:30.480> that<00:03:30.630> tough<00:03:30.840> as<00:03:31.110> you

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
the enemies weren't that tough as you

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.810 
the enemies weren't that tough as you
can<00:03:31.350> see<00:03:31.470> the<00:03:31.590> score<00:03:31.829> here<00:03:32.040> so<00:03:32.519> I'm<00:03:32.579> kind<00:03:32.760> of

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
can see the score here so I'm kind of

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.100 
can see the score here so I'm kind of
messing<00:03:33.090> around<00:03:33.150> experimenting<00:03:33.900> with<00:03:33.959> the

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
messing around experimenting with the

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.660 
messing around experimenting with the
crossbow<00:03:34.320> but<00:03:34.739> if<00:03:34.980> you're<00:03:35.310> going<00:03:35.400> to<00:03:35.459> be<00:03:35.579> on

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
crossbow but if you're going to be on

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.690 
crossbow but if you're going to be on
the<00:03:35.760> hardpoint<00:03:36.120> a<00:03:36.299> lot<00:03:36.829> hard<00:03:37.829> hard<00:03:38.130> line<00:03:38.370> is

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
the hardpoint a lot hard hard line is

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.190 
the hardpoint a lot hard hard line is
going<00:03:38.850> to<00:03:39.150> do<00:03:39.269> a<00:03:39.299> really<00:03:39.600> good<00:03:39.750> job<00:03:39.780> because

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
going to do a really good job because

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.840 
going to do a really good job because
it's<00:03:40.440> going<00:03:40.560> to<00:03:40.650> amplify<00:03:41.070> your<00:03:41.100> score<00:03:41.610> I

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
all and I got all my killstreaks twice

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.210 
all and I got all my killstreaks twice
because<00:03:57.900> of<00:03:58.170> hardline<00:03:58.560> and<00:03:58.769> I<00:03:58.829> guess<00:03:59.010> I'm<00:03:59.190> a

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
because of hardline and I guess I'm a

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.490 
because of hardline and I guess I'm a
couple<00:03:59.459> assists<00:03:59.970> from<00:04:00.090> other<00:04:00.299> things<00:04:00.630> but<00:04:01.290> I

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
couple assists from other things but I

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.259 
couple assists from other things but I
got<00:04:01.680> all<00:04:01.920> my<00:04:01.950> killstreaks<00:04:02.340> twice<00:04:02.850> and<00:04:03.090> it<00:04:03.180> was

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
got all my killstreaks twice and it was

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:04.880 
got all my killstreaks twice and it was
really<00:04:03.510> cool<00:04:03.630> if<00:04:03.810> it<00:04:04.200> wasn't<00:04:04.470> for<00:04:04.560> hardline<00:04:04.859> I

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
really cool if it wasn't for hardline I

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.440 
really cool if it wasn't for hardline I
wouldn't<00:04:05.220> been<00:04:05.370> able<00:04:05.489> to<00:04:05.579> do<00:04:05.700> that<00:04:05.820> so

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
wouldn't been able to do that so

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.270 
wouldn't been able to do that so
hopefully<00:04:07.109> you<00:04:07.290> guys<00:04:07.410> can<00:04:07.470> use<00:04:07.829> this<00:04:07.980> class

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
hopefully you guys can use this class

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.789 
hopefully you guys can use this class
f27<00:04:09.000> also<00:04:09.540> is<00:04:09.630> a<00:04:09.690> very<00:04:09.930> good<00:04:10.019> gun<00:04:10.320> to<00:04:10.440> use<00:04:10.590> I
