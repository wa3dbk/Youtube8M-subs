when<00:00:03.350> you're<00:00:03.470> transitioning<00:00:03.830> from<00:00:04.220> seated<00:00:04.700> to

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:04.850 
when you're transitioning from seated to

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.929 
when you're transitioning from seated to
stand<00:00:05.120> in<00:00:05.270> climbing<00:00:05.720> if<00:00:06.319> it's<00:00:06.979> a<00:00:07.130> conditions

00:00:07.929 --> 00:00:07.939 
stand in climbing if it's a conditions

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:10.510 
stand in climbing if it's a conditions
where<00:00:08.480> you<00:00:08.660> have<00:00:08.840> good<00:00:09.080> traction<00:00:09.400> ideally<00:00:10.400> you

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:10.520 
where you have good traction ideally you

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.300 
where you have good traction ideally you
would<00:00:11.270> want<00:00:11.330> to<00:00:11.660> shift<00:00:11.870> up<00:00:12.140> two<00:00:12.530> gears<00:00:12.830> to

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:13.310 
would want to shift up two gears to

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:16.119 
would want to shift up two gears to
harder<00:00:13.820> gears<00:00:14.320> just<00:00:15.320> a<00:00:15.470> comments<00:00:15.830> say<00:00:15.890> for<00:00:16.070> the

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:16.129 
harder gears just a comments say for the

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:17.230 
harder gears just a comments say for the
fact<00:00:16.309> that<00:00:16.430> you're<00:00:16.519> gonna<00:00:16.609> make<00:00:16.820> more<00:00:17.000> power

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:17.240 
fact that you're gonna make more power

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.500 
fact that you're gonna make more power
and<00:00:18.019> get<00:00:18.260> the<00:00:18.320> most<00:00:18.439> efficiency<00:00:18.830> out<00:00:18.980> of<00:00:19.070> it

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:19.510 
and get the most efficiency out of it

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.290 
and get the most efficiency out of it
and<00:00:20.510> then<00:00:21.410> when<00:00:22.100> you<00:00:22.130> are<00:00:22.400> climbing<00:00:22.640> standing

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
and then when you are climbing standing

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.300 
and then when you are climbing standing
it's<00:00:23.600> just<00:00:23.810> you<00:00:24.110> gotta<00:00:24.289> you<00:00:24.560> have<00:00:24.650> to<00:00:24.740> focus<00:00:24.920> on

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
it's just you gotta you have to focus on

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:27.970 
it's just you gotta you have to focus on
keeping<00:00:26.210> your<00:00:26.420> weight<00:00:26.720> shifts<00:00:27.170> appropriately

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
keeping your weight shifts appropriately

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.890 
keeping your weight shifts appropriately
and<00:00:28.340> as<00:00:28.820> we<00:00:28.940> climb<00:00:29.150> this<00:00:29.330> section<00:00:29.600> of<00:00:29.690> trail

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
and as we climb this section of trail

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.139 
and as we climb this section of trail
I'll<00:00:30.590> demonstrate<00:00:30.859> both<00:00:31.279> appropriate<00:00:32.000> and

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:32.149 
I'll demonstrate both appropriate and

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:33.639 
I'll demonstrate both appropriate and
inappropriate<00:00:32.390> weight<00:00:32.960> shifting<00:00:33.410> and<00:00:33.530> weight

00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:33.649 
inappropriate weight shifting and weight

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:35.380 
inappropriate weight shifting and weight
distribution<00:00:33.800> as<00:00:34.760> well<00:00:34.940> as<00:00:34.999> pedaling

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
distribution as well as pedaling

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.000 
distribution as well as pedaling
technique<00:00:35.510> and<00:00:35.960> you'll<00:00:36.079> see<00:00:36.229> what<00:00:36.350> the<00:00:36.499> market

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:37.010 
technique and you'll see what the market

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.189 
technique and you'll see what the market
differences<00:00:37.460> are<00:00:37.640> in<00:00:37.850> style<00:00:38.089> so<00:00:38.870> I'll<00:00:38.960> start

00:00:39.189 --> 00:00:39.199 
differences are in style so I'll start

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:41.469 
differences are in style so I'll start
off<00:00:39.379> trying<00:00:39.769> to<00:00:40.069> trying<00:00:41.059> to<00:00:41.120> ride<00:00:41.269> rather

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:41.479 
off trying to trying to ride rather

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:44.349 
off trying to trying to ride rather
sloppy<00:00:41.780> and<00:00:42.109> we'll<00:00:42.620> see<00:00:42.829> if<00:00:43.609> that<00:00:43.670> Nets<00:00:44.030> the

00:00:44.349 --> 00:00:44.359 
sloppy and we'll see if that Nets the

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:47.020 
sloppy and we'll see if that Nets the
desired<00:00:44.809> negative<00:00:45.170> result<00:00:45.670> so<00:00:46.670> I'm<00:00:46.760> setting

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
desired negative result so I'm setting

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.410 
desired negative result so I'm setting
up<00:00:47.499> um<00:00:48.499> real<00:00:48.949> upright<00:00:49.699> you<00:00:49.940> know<00:00:50.030> standing

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
up um real upright you know standing

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:57.759 
up um real upright you know standing
just<00:00:54.879> you<00:00:55.879> know<00:00:55.999> it's<00:00:56.359> just<00:00:56.539> it's<00:00:57.379> like<00:00:57.440> riding

00:00:57.759 --> 00:00:57.769 
just you know it's just it's like riding

00:00:57.769 --> 00:00:59.680 
just you know it's just it's like riding
a<00:00:57.829> bucking<00:00:58.429> bronco<00:00:58.639> things<00:00:59.359> just<00:00:59.539> aren't

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
a bucking bronco things just aren't

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.989 
a bucking bronco things just aren't
working<00:00:59.839> out<00:01:00.079> well<00:01:00.289> I<00:01:00.530> was<00:01:01.489> in<00:01:01.579> a<00:01:01.639> really<00:01:01.879> low

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:01.999 
working out well I was in a really low

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:04.960 
working out well I was in a really low
gear<00:01:02.409> really<00:01:03.409> standing<00:01:03.829> up<00:01:04.010> you<00:01:04.729> know<00:01:04.850> it's

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
gear really standing up you know it's

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.750 
gear really standing up you know it's
hard<00:01:05.750> for<00:01:05.930> me<00:01:06.020> to<00:01:06.110> mess<00:01:06.260> up<00:01:06.440> sometimes<00:01:06.740> but<00:01:07.730> I

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
hard for me to mess up sometimes but I

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:08.950 
hard for me to mess up sometimes but I
think<00:01:08.000> you<00:01:08.090> understand<00:01:08.570> what<00:01:08.630> the<00:01:08.720> design

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
think you understand what the design

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.600 
think you understand what the design
what's<00:01:09.560> gonna<00:01:09.680> happen<00:01:10.010> is<00:01:10.100> you're<00:01:10.130> gonna<00:01:10.280> spin

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
what's gonna happen is you're gonna spin

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.870 
what's gonna happen is you're gonna spin
out<00:01:10.640> so<00:01:11.350> I'll<00:01:12.350> grab<00:01:12.890> the<00:01:13.130> two<00:01:13.280> gears<00:01:13.490> that<00:01:13.820> I

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
out so I'll grab the two gears that I

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.920 
out so I'll grab the two gears that I
should<00:01:14.180> grab<00:01:14.950> lower<00:01:15.950> my<00:01:16.220> weight<00:01:16.720> get<00:01:17.720> nice<00:01:17.900> and

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:17.930 
should grab lower my weight get nice and

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.450 
should grab lower my weight get nice and
low<00:01:18.280> and<00:01:19.280> enables<00:01:20.030> me<00:01:20.180> to<00:01:20.860> get<00:01:21.860> up<00:01:21.980> this<00:01:22.190> climb

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
low and enables me to get up this climb

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.050 
low and enables me to get up this climb
which<00:01:23.030> is<00:01:23.060> a<00:01:23.650> lot<00:01:24.650> more<00:01:24.830> difficult<00:01:25.040> than<00:01:25.970> the

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
which is a lot more difficult than the

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.120 
which is a lot more difficult than the
section<00:01:26.300> I<00:01:26.360> was<00:01:26.450> just<00:01:26.630> on<00:01:26.860> with<00:01:27.860> a<00:01:27.890> lot<00:01:28.100> less

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
section I was just on with a lot less

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.880 
section I was just on with a lot less
wasted<00:01:28.700> energy<00:01:28.910> and<00:01:29.320> climbing<00:01:30.320> is<00:01:30.440> you<00:01:30.770> know

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
wasted energy and climbing is you know

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.190 
wasted energy and climbing is you know
partially<00:01:31.250> about<00:01:31.750> conserving<00:01:32.750> energy<00:01:32.840> so<00:01:33.140> you

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
partially about conserving energy so you

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.780 
partially about conserving energy so you
can<00:01:33.350> have<00:01:33.500> more<00:01:33.590> fun<00:01:33.650> in<00:01:33.890> the<00:01:33.950> downhill<00:01:34.340> and<00:01:35.500> so

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
can have more fun in the downhill and so

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.640 
can have more fun in the downhill and so
grab<00:01:37.790> that<00:01:37.820> two<00:01:38.300> extra<00:01:38.600> gears<00:01:38.840> what<00:01:39.320> you<00:01:39.440> want

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
grab that two extra gears what you want

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.000 
grab that two extra gears what you want
to<00:01:40.270> you<00:01:41.270> know<00:01:41.330> make<00:01:41.510> sure<00:01:41.540> that<00:01:41.780> you're

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.010 
to you know make sure that you're

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.140 
to you know make sure that you're
getting<00:01:43.010> the<00:01:43.160> most<00:01:43.340> out<00:01:43.460> of<00:01:43.520> your<00:01:43.640> efficiency

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
getting the most out of your efficiency

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.500 
getting the most out of your efficiency
I<00:01:45.580> lowered<00:01:46.580> my<00:01:46.730> center<00:01:46.970> of<00:01:47.030> gravity<00:01:47.090> and

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510 
I lowered my center of gravity and

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.200 
I lowered my center of gravity and
really<00:01:47.720> pulled<00:01:47.900> back<00:01:48.050> on<00:01:48.080> the<00:01:48.290> wheel<00:01:48.440> and

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
really pulled back on the wheel and

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.250 
really pulled back on the wheel and
tried<00:01:50.210> to<00:01:50.270> pedal<00:01:50.420> a<00:01:50.510> little<00:01:50.540> bit<00:01:50.750> smoother<00:01:51.110> and

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:51.260 
tried to pedal a little bit smoother and

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.130 
tried to pedal a little bit smoother and
it<00:01:51.650> kept<00:01:51.890> me<00:01:51.980> on<00:01:52.610> the<00:01:52.670> bike<00:01:53.510> doing<00:01:53.750> what<00:01:53.930> I<00:01:53.960> need

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
it kept me on the bike doing what I need

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.380 
it kept me on the bike doing what I need
to<00:01:54.260> do
