00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
you have to calculate like how far do

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.150 
you have to calculate like how far do
you<00:02:27.390> want<00:02:27.450> to<00:02:27.599> go<00:02:27.750> above<00:02:28.290> his<00:02:28.470> head<00:02:28.680> if<00:02:29.099> you

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
you want to go above his head if you

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.050 
you want to go above his head if you

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
want to kill them with one shot so it's

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.720 
want to kill them with one shot so it's
not<00:02:33.269> just<00:02:33.330> like<00:02:33.799> you<00:02:34.799> zoom<00:02:35.129> in<00:02:35.280> you<00:02:35.430> see<00:02:35.700> the

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
not just like you zoom in you see the

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.789 
not just like you zoom in you see the
guy<00:02:35.970> you<00:02:36.299> wait<00:02:36.510> like<00:02:36.660> two<00:02:36.959> seconds<00:02:37.379> and<00:02:37.650> then

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
guy you wait like two seconds and then

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:41.150 
guy you wait like two seconds and then
you<00:02:37.920> shoot<00:02:38.190> kind<00:02:39.180> of<00:02:39.239> have<00:02:39.330> to<00:02:39.860> sometimes<00:02:40.860> wait

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
you shoot kind of have to sometimes wait

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.569 
you shoot kind of have to sometimes wait
more<00:02:41.370> than<00:02:41.400> that<00:02:41.730> but<00:02:42.799> you<00:02:43.799> can't<00:02:44.010> cook<00:02:44.190> quick

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579 
more than that but you can't cook quick

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
don't really use a button if you got a

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.430 
don't really use a button if you got a
computer<00:04:57.310> that<00:04:57.700> can<00:04:58.090> handle<00:04:58.210> fraps<00:04:58.660> so<00:04:58.990> feel

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
computer that can handle fraps so feel

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.120
