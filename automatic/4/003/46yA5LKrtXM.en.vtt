Collins in dynasty this role and more a

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.870 
Collins in dynasty this role and more a
piece<00:00:37.840> references<00:00:38.590> that<00:00:38.739> mood<00:00:39.040> on<00:00:39.250> the<00:00:39.309> runway

this was shown with a body con dress but

this was shown with a body con dress but
for<00:00:42.399> real<00:00:42.579> life<00:00:42.910> I<00:00:43.239> like<00:00:43.630> the<00:00:43.750> idea<00:00:44.020> of

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.110 
for real life I like the idea of

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.229 
for real life I like the idea of
softening<00:00:44.710> this<00:00:44.920> look<00:00:45.190> so<00:00:45.550> I've<00:00:45.700> teamed<00:00:46.000> it

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
softening this look so I've teamed it

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:48.120 
softening this look so I've teamed it
with<00:00:46.270> a<00:00:46.420> pleated<00:00:46.719> black<00:00:47.110> skirt<00:00:47.530> it's<00:00:47.829> more

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:48.130 
with a pleated black skirt it's more

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:50.369 
with a pleated black skirt it's more
forgiving<00:00:48.820> and<00:00:49.030> I<00:00:49.390> think<00:00:49.600> it<00:00:49.690> really<00:00:49.780> offsets

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:50.379 
forgiving and I think it really offsets

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:52.619 
forgiving and I think it really offsets
the<00:00:50.559> strict<00:00:50.920> structure<00:00:51.489> of<00:00:51.610> this<00:00:51.760> jacket<00:00:52.329> this

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629 
the strict structure of this jacket this

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:54.389 
the strict structure of this jacket this
bold<00:00:52.960> color<00:00:53.290> makes<00:00:53.590> it<00:00:53.680> even<00:00:53.800> more<00:00:53.950> of<00:00:54.309> a

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:54.399 
bold color makes it even more of a

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:56.160 
bold color makes it even more of a
statement<00:00:54.700> piece<00:00:55.120> and<00:00:55.360> I<00:00:55.510> think<00:00:55.719> the<00:00:55.809> easiest

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
statement piece and I think the easiest

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.410 
statement piece and I think the easiest
way<00:00:56.469> to<00:00:56.500> wear<00:00:56.860> bright<00:00:57.160> hues<00:00:57.550> is<00:00:57.969> to<00:00:58.210> team<00:00:58.390> them

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:58.420 
way to wear bright hues is to team them

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.900 
way to wear bright hues is to team them
with<00:00:58.750> black<00:00:59.079> or<00:00:59.350> neutral<00:00:59.770> tones<00:01:00.070> this<00:01:00.579> is<00:01:00.789> an

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910 
with black or neutral tones this is an

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.189 
with black or neutral tones this is an
outfit<00:01:01.210> that<00:01:01.360> you<00:01:01.450> could<00:01:01.600> virtually<00:01:01.750> wear

new<00:01:31.869> and<00:01:32.110> so<00:01:32.170> modern<00:01:32.770> on<00:01:32.979> the<00:01:33.250> runway<00:01:33.670> it<00:01:33.849> was

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:33.910 
new and so modern on the runway it was

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.940 
new and so modern on the runway it was
styled<00:01:34.420> as<00:01:34.509> a<00:01:34.539> top<00:01:34.840> to<00:01:35.020> toe<00:01:35.170> leather<00:01:35.470> look<00:01:35.800> but

styled as a top to toe leather look but
all<00:01:36.340> over<00:01:36.399> leather<00:01:37.000> is<00:01:37.149> a<00:01:37.209> bit<00:01:37.390> much<00:01:37.630> for<00:01:37.660> me<00:01:37.990> so

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.359 
I've opted instead to wear it with a
pair<00:01:40.360> of<00:01:40.390> skinny<00:01:40.780> jeans<00:01:40.959> it<00:01:41.590> maintains<00:01:42.130> the

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
pair of skinny jeans it maintains the

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
the play of the leather against this

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.050 
the play of the leather against this
more<00:01:52.989> textural<00:01:53.500> pattern<00:01:54.009> this<00:01:54.580> jacket

sophisticated spin there is definitely a

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.240 
sophisticated spin there is definitely a
utilitarian<00:02:03.640> influence<00:02:04.360> on<00:02:04.539> the<00:02:04.630> runway<00:02:04.899> this

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
utilitarian influence on the runway this

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:07.230 
and the spell staff jacket is a great

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:08.270 
and the spell staff jacket is a great
example<00:02:08.010> of<00:02:08.100> that

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
example of that

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.790 
example of that
urban<00:02:08.640> Safari<00:02:09.030> trend<00:02:09.570> and<00:02:09.900> the<00:02:10.110> catwalk<00:02:10.590> this

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
skirt but that's by no means the only

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.770 
skirt but that's by no means the only
way<00:02:14.250> that<00:02:14.400> you<00:02:14.490> can<00:02:14.670> wear<00:02:14.820> this<00:02:15.030> piece<00:02:15.360> I've

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
gone for an off-duty take and added

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.330 
gone for an off-duty take and added
these<00:02:18.000> boyfriend<00:02:18.630> jeans<00:02:18.960> regular<00:02:19.800> blue<00:02:20.040> denim

these boyfriend jeans regular blue denim

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.860 
these boyfriend jeans regular blue denim
would<00:02:20.460> also<00:02:20.610> look<00:02:20.910> great<00:02:21.180> with<00:02:21.390> this<00:02:21.540> jacket

would also look great with this jacket

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.930 
would also look great with this jacket
but<00:02:22.290> I<00:02:22.350> love<00:02:22.680> how<00:02:22.800> this<00:02:22.950> army<00:02:23.280> green<00:02:23.550> pair

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
but I love how this army green pair

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.330 
but I love how this army green pair
maintains<00:02:24.510> that<00:02:24.660> utilitarian<00:02:25.530> feel<00:02:25.860> this<00:02:26.190> is

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
maintains that utilitarian feel this is

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.950 
maintains that utilitarian feel this is
a<00:02:26.370> really<00:02:26.670> hard<00:02:26.970> working<00:02:27.420> piece<00:02:27.630> it<00:02:27.870> would

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
a really hard working piece it would

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.270 
a really hard working piece it would
also<00:02:28.110> look<00:02:28.380> great<00:02:28.530> with<00:02:28.800> a<00:02:28.830> lot<00:02:29.010> of<00:02:29.070> your

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
also look great with a lot of your

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.880 
also look great with a lot of your
wardrobe<00:02:29.760> basics<00:02:30.270> like<00:02:30.720> shorts<00:02:31.380> or<00:02:31.620> even

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
wardrobe basics like shorts or even

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.310 
wardrobe basics like shorts or even
white<00:02:32.100> jeans<00:02:32.490> but<00:02:33.150> utility<00:02:33.720> doesn't<00:02:34.110> just

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
white jeans but utility doesn't just

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.320 
white jeans but utility doesn't just
mean<00:02:34.470> casual<00:02:35.100> you<00:02:35.580> can<00:02:35.610> also<00:02:35.910> wear<00:02:36.180> this

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330

mean casual you can also wear this
jacket<00:02:36.570> after<00:02:37.140> dark<00:02:37.410> I'd<00:02:37.680> like<00:02:38.070> to<00:02:38.220> think<00:02:38.370> of

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
jacket after dark I'd like to think of

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.310 
jacket after dark I'd like to think of
this<00:02:38.670> as<00:02:38.880> a<00:02:38.910> modern<00:02:39.420> and<00:02:39.570> unexpected

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
this as a modern and unexpected

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.440 
this as a modern and unexpected
replacement<00:02:40.980> to<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.130> black<00:02:41.340> tux<00:02:41.670> jacket<00:02:42.000> and

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
replacement to the black tux jacket and

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.120 
replacement to the black tux jacket and
the<00:02:42.600> neutral<00:02:43.020> tone<00:02:43.290> is<00:02:43.620> a<00:02:43.680> nice<00:02:43.920> alternative

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
the neutral tone is a nice alternative

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.520 
the neutral tone is a nice alternative
to<00:02:44.640> black<00:02:44.760> it<00:02:45.360> just<00:02:45.390> feels<00:02:45.810> fresher<00:02:46.140> and<00:02:46.380> a<00:02:46.410> bit

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
to black it just feels fresher and a bit

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.320 
to black it just feels fresher and a bit
more<00:02:46.680> interesting<00:02:47.310> that's<00:02:47.760> three<00:02:48.120> new
