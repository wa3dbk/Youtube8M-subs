00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
is that he was sick he had had a

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.670 
is that he was sick he had had a
sickness<00:00:32.700> for<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.120> long<00:00:33.480> time<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.230> that

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
sickness for a long time and that

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.979 
sickness for a long time and that
actually<00:00:35.160> needed<00:00:35.399> him<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:36.090> get<00:00:36.239> healed<00:00:36.809> or

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
actually needed him to get healed or

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.260 
actually needed him to get healed or
stuff<00:00:37.230> but<00:00:37.440> he<00:00:37.620> had<00:00:37.770> a<00:00:37.800> sickness<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:38.579> nobody

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
stuff but he had a sickness and nobody

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.780 
stuff but he had a sickness and nobody
knows<00:00:39.540> if<00:00:39.870> he<00:00:40.110> could<00:00:40.290> have<00:00:40.410> died<00:00:40.680> or<00:00:40.950> not<00:00:40.980> so

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
knows if he could have died or not so

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.400 
knows if he could have died or not so
what<00:00:41.940> am<00:00:42.059> i<00:00:42.120> talking<00:00:42.480> about<00:00:42.660> in<00:00:42.809> this<00:00:42.989> theory

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
what am i talking about in this theory

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.340 
what am i talking about in this theory
well<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.399> theory<00:00:44.640> might<00:00:45.000> be<00:00:45.180> that<00:00:45.510> wally<00:00:45.870> got

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
well the theory might be that wally got

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.139 
well the theory might be that wally got
the<00:00:46.590> sickness<00:00:46.829> simply<00:00:47.489> because<00:00:47.789> he<00:00:47.879> lived

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
the sickness simply because he lived

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.840 
the sickness simply because he lived
closest<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.410> volcano<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.370> that<00:00:50.489> probably

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
closest to the volcano and that probably

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.510 
closest to the volcano and that probably
did<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.239> lot<00:00:51.510> of<00:00:51.539> pollutants<00:00:52.289> into<00:00:53.010> his<00:00:53.250> health

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
did a lot of pollutants into his health

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.700 
did a lot of pollutants into his health
that<00:00:54.000> made<00:00:54.270> him<00:00:54.420> go<00:00:54.840> back<00:00:55.110> maybe<00:00:55.410> he<00:00:55.530> had<00:00:55.680> a

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
that made him go back maybe he had a

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.490 
that made him go back maybe he had a
weak<00:00:55.980> immune<00:00:56.370> system<00:00:57.020> now<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.079> thing<00:00:58.469> is

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
weak immune system now the thing is

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.029 
weak immune system now the thing is
Wally<00:00:59.539> why<00:01:00.539> could<00:01:00.930> he<00:01:01.020> possibly<00:01:01.260> have<00:01:01.770> died

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
Wally why could he possibly have died

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.670 
Wally why could he possibly have died
well<00:01:02.609> basically<00:01:03.000> when<00:01:03.570> you're<00:01:03.899> about<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.439> end

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
well basically when you're about to end

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.399 
well basically when you're about to end
up<00:01:04.890> going<00:01:05.040> into<00:01:05.309> Victory<00:01:05.790> Road<00:01:06.090> Wally<00:01:06.840> is<00:01:07.200> the

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
up going into Victory Road Wally is the

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.859 
up going into Victory Road Wally is the
trainer<00:01:07.950> there<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.670> he<00:01:09.240> is<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.540> one<00:01:09.630> that's

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
trainer there and he is the one that's

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.780 
trainer there and he is the one that's
going<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.170> battle<00:01:10.619> you<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:10.979> even<00:01:11.490> after<00:01:11.640> you

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
going to battle you and even after you

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.510 
going to battle you and even after you
beat<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.330> game<00:01:12.570> he<00:01:12.840> battles<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.409> again<00:01:13.770> so

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
beat the game he battles you again so

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.399 
beat the game he battles you again so
what<00:01:14.729> many<00:01:15.000> people<00:01:15.210> think<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:15.689> he<00:01:16.110> might<00:01:16.380> be

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
what many people think that he might be

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.940 
what many people think that he might be
a<00:01:16.890> ghost<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:18.150> yes<00:01:18.540> I<00:01:18.780> guess<00:01:19.140> I<00:01:19.409> know<00:01:19.470> it<00:01:19.740> sounds

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
a ghost and yes I guess I know it sounds

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.039 
a ghost and yes I guess I know it sounds
kind<00:01:20.130> of<00:01:20.220> odd<00:01:20.400> but<00:01:20.759> he<00:01:21.000> might<00:01:21.420> be<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:21.570> ghost<00:01:21.840> in

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
kind of odd but he might be a ghost in

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.230 
kind of odd but he might be a ghost in
the<00:01:22.140> his<00:01:22.259> spirit<00:01:22.619> lives<00:01:22.740> on<00:01:22.950> there<00:01:23.250> every<00:01:23.729> time

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
the his spirit lives on there every time

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.469 
the his spirit lives on there every time
and<00:01:24.630> continues<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.409> battle<00:01:25.860> until<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:27.030> can

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
and continues to battle until you can

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.010 
and continues to battle until you can
defeat<00:01:27.780> Wally<00:01:28.460> now<00:01:29.460> yeah<00:01:29.970> in<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.600> theory<00:01:30.990> of

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
defeat Wally now yeah in the theory of

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.859 
defeat Wally now yeah in the theory of
that<00:01:31.380> it's<00:01:31.890> kind<00:01:32.130> of<00:01:32.250> odd<00:01:32.490> but<00:01:32.820> in<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.420> Pokemon

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
that it's kind of odd but in the Pokemon

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.300 
that it's kind of odd but in the Pokemon
world<00:01:33.900> they<00:01:34.259> have<00:01:34.439> these<00:01:34.590> theories<00:01:34.950> about

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
world they have these theories about

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.550 
world they have these theories about
ghosts<00:01:35.939> being<00:01:36.240> in<00:01:36.540> different<00:01:36.900> places<00:01:37.170> so

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
ghosts being in different places so

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.120 
ghosts being in different places so
Wally<00:01:38.189> probably<00:01:38.880> ended<00:01:39.390> up<00:01:39.509> dying<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.320> that

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
Wally probably ended up dying and that

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.999 
Wally probably ended up dying and that
he<00:01:41.280> passed<00:01:41.549> away<00:01:41.759> in<00:01:42.390> Victory<00:01:42.810> Road<00:01:43.049> once<00:01:43.649> the

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
he passed away in Victory Road once the

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.920 
he passed away in Victory Road once the
battle<00:01:44.220> ended<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:44.939> that's<00:01:45.180> why<00:01:45.360> his<00:01:45.570> spirit

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
battle ended and that's why his spirit

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.260 
battle ended and that's why his spirit
lives<00:01:46.170> there<00:01:46.350> forever<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.280> that's<00:01:47.820> why<00:01:48.030> every

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
lives there forever and that's why every

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.929 
lives there forever and that's why every
time<00:01:48.299> you<00:01:48.570> go<00:01:48.720> to<00:01:48.780> there<00:01:49.770> he's<00:01:50.070> asking<00:01:50.579> you<00:01:50.700> for

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
time you go to there he's asking you for

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.050 
time you go to there he's asking you for
a<00:01:51.210> battle<00:01:51.930> now<00:01:52.710> he<00:01:52.799> was<00:01:53.100> pretty<00:01:53.340> sick<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:53.939> it

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
a battle now he was pretty sick and it

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.789 
a battle now he was pretty sick and it
was<00:01:54.240> pretty<00:01:54.450> odd<00:01:54.720> that<00:01:54.960> his<00:01:55.140> sentence<00:01:55.619> just

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
was pretty odd that his sentence just

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.100 
was pretty odd that his sentence just
worn<00:01:56.130> away<00:01:56.490> they<00:01:56.850> said<00:01:57.030> he<00:01:57.149> was<00:01:57.329> very<00:01:57.689> sick

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
worn away they said he was very sick

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.950 
worn away they said he was very sick
another<00:01:59.100> theory<00:01:59.340> is<00:01:59.460> that<00:01:59.820> basically<00:02:00.390> when<00:02:00.750> he

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
another theory is that basically when he

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.050 
another theory is that basically when he
got<00:02:01.290> there<00:02:01.619> he<00:02:01.799> didn't<00:02:02.100> have<00:02:02.219> any<00:02:02.399> water<00:02:02.729> type

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
got there he didn't have any water type

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.480 
got there he didn't have any water type
Pokemon<00:02:03.090> or<00:02:03.719> flying-type<00:02:04.200> pokémon<00:02:04.590> so<00:02:05.130> how

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
Pokemon or flying-type pokémon so how

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.210 
Pokemon or flying-type pokémon so how
possibly<00:02:06.210> did<00:02:06.570> he<00:02:06.780> get<00:02:07.049> there<00:02:07.350> some<00:02:07.950> people

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
possibly did he get there some people

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.680 
possibly did he get there some people
are<00:02:08.310> saying<00:02:08.459> that<00:02:08.700> his<00:02:08.879> parents<00:02:09.270> actually

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
are saying that his parents actually

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.390 
are saying that his parents actually
paid<00:02:09.929> for<00:02:09.959> him<00:02:10.289> to<00:02:10.440> go<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:10.590> Evergrande<00:02:11.129> the

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
paid for him to go to Evergrande the

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.550 
paid for him to go to Evergrande the
city<00:02:12.030> so<00:02:12.300> he<00:02:12.330> could<00:02:12.660> battle

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
city so he could battle

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.890 
city so he could battle
you<00:02:13.709> for<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.099> final<00:02:14.640> time<00:02:14.880> which<00:02:15.690> was<00:02:15.870> a

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
you for the final time which was a

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.290 
you for the final time which was a
pretty<00:02:16.140> good<00:02:16.290> battle<00:02:16.560> now<00:02:17.520> I<00:02:17.550> know<00:02:18.000> this

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
pretty good battle now I know this

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.750 
pretty good battle now I know this
theory<00:02:18.599> is<00:02:18.840> not<00:02:19.020> confirmed<00:02:19.560> that<00:02:19.739> any<00:02:19.920> means

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
theory is not confirmed that any means

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.300 
theory is not confirmed that any means
that<00:02:20.970> while<00:02:21.390> he<00:02:21.599> died<00:02:22.230> or<00:02:22.650> anything<00:02:22.980> because

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
that while he died or anything because

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.850 
that while he died or anything because
Omega<00:02:24.060> Ruby<00:02:24.480> and<00:02:24.750> alpha<00:02:24.870> sapphire<00:02:25.080> are<00:02:25.590> coming

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
Omega Ruby and alpha sapphire are coming

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.830 
Omega Ruby and alpha sapphire are coming
out<00:02:25.980> soon<00:02:26.310> and<00:02:26.700> that<00:02:27.209> might<00:02:27.390> change<00:02:27.660> the

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
out soon and that might change the

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.309 
out soon and that might change the
storyline<00:02:28.319> a<00:02:28.349> little<00:02:28.680> bit<00:02:28.890> if<00:02:29.160> he<00:02:30.319> continues

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
storyline a little bit if he continues

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.199 
storyline a little bit if he continues
to<00:02:31.349> see<00:02:31.620> Wally<00:02:31.890> after<00:02:32.340> you<00:02:32.430> defeat<00:02:32.819> him<00:02:32.849> so

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
to see Wally after you defeat him so

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:34.880 
to see Wally after you defeat him so
we'll<00:02:33.390> see<00:02:33.540> in<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:33.750> future<00:02:33.780> of<00:02:34.230> what<00:02:34.440> they<00:02:34.590> say

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
we'll see in the future of what they say

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.040 
we'll see in the future of what they say
and<00:02:35.099> Omega<00:02:35.700> Ruby<00:02:35.880> and<00:02:36.120> alpha<00:02:36.209> sapphire<00:02:36.420> but

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
and Omega Ruby and alpha sapphire but

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.930 
and Omega Ruby and alpha sapphire but
this<00:02:37.230> theory<00:02:37.440> is<00:02:37.800> a<00:02:37.830> pretty<00:02:38.700> interesting

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
this theory is a pretty interesting

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.839 
this theory is a pretty interesting
theory<00:02:39.630> that<00:02:39.780> while<00:02:40.050> he<00:02:40.200> may<00:02:40.319> have<00:02:40.440> died<00:02:40.849> also

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
theory that while he may have died also

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:45.140 
theory that while he may have died also
in<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.390> Pokemon<00:02:43.170> Comics<00:02:44.099> I<00:02:44.250> believe<00:02:44.519> he<00:02:44.880> does

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
in the Pokemon Comics I believe he does

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
in the Pokemon Comics I believe he does
indeed<00:02:46.880> come<00:02:47.880> out<00:02:48.090> in<00:02:48.239> there<00:02:48.540> as<00:02:48.720> well<00:02:48.900> he's

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
indeed come out in there as well he's

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.860 
indeed come out in there as well he's
always<00:02:49.350> wearing<00:02:49.620> a<00:02:49.830> respirator<00:02:50.010> and<00:02:50.730> as<00:02:51.630> well

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
always wearing a respirator and as well

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.530 
always wearing a respirator and as well
they<00:02:52.110> sent<00:02:52.620> him<00:02:52.830> he<00:02:53.310> sent<00:02:53.580> he<00:02:53.760> retired<00:02:54.180> like<00:02:54.420> at

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
they sent him he sent he retired like at

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.390 
they sent him he sent he retired like at
the<00:02:54.690> end<00:02:54.810> I<00:02:54.959> believe<00:02:55.260> where<00:02:55.890> he<00:02:56.040> gave<00:02:56.250> his

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
the end I believe where he gave his

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
the end I believe where he gave his
pokedex<00:02:57.000> back<00:02:57.299> to<00:02:57.750> Ruby<00:02:58.530> and<00:02:58.940> another<00:02:59.940> person

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
pokedex back to Ruby and another person

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.600 
pokedex back to Ruby and another person
so<00:03:00.900> yeah<00:03:01.170> so<00:03:01.500> that<00:03:01.530> so<00:03:01.980> pretty<00:03:02.190> much<00:03:02.400> the

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
so yeah so that so pretty much the

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:08.030 
so yeah so that so pretty much the
theory<00:03:02.940> of<00:03:03.060> the<00:03:03.269> ghost<00:03:03.510> of<00:03:03.750> Wally<00:03:06.950> for<00:03:07.950> our

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
theory of the ghost of Wally for our

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.220 
theory of the ghost of Wally for our
next<00:03:08.250> Pokemon<00:03:08.700> theory<00:03:08.970> is<00:03:09.209> wobbuffet<00:03:09.870> still

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
next Pokemon theory is wobbuffet still

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.990 
next Pokemon theory is wobbuffet still
what<00:03:10.590> am<00:03:10.680> I<00:03:10.769> talking<00:03:11.069> about<00:03:11.130> when<00:03:11.489> I<00:03:11.519> mentioned

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
what am I talking about when I mentioned

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.150 
what am I talking about when I mentioned
Wobbuffet<00:03:12.480> so<00:03:12.810> well<00:03:13.440> as<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:13.680> supposedly

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
Wobbuffet so well as the supposedly

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.339 
Wobbuffet so well as the supposedly
theory<00:03:14.519> is<00:03:14.730> that<00:03:15.000> while<00:03:15.299> if<00:03:15.450> it<00:03:15.660> is<00:03:15.780> actually<00:03:16.319> a

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
theory is that while if it is actually a

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:18.800 
theory is that while if it is actually a
decoy<00:03:16.860> the<00:03:17.040> whole<00:03:17.220> blue<00:03:17.459> body<00:03:17.700> is<00:03:17.970> a<00:03:18.000> decoy<00:03:18.480> and

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
decoy the whole blue body is a decoy and

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.140 
decoy the whole blue body is a decoy and
the<00:03:18.959> thing<00:03:19.140> that<00:03:19.170> hides<00:03:19.500> behind<00:03:19.739> it<00:03:20.130> itself<00:03:20.910> is

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
the thing that hides behind it itself is

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.759 
the thing that hides behind it itself is
actually<00:03:21.390> the<00:03:21.750> one<00:03:21.989> controlling<00:03:22.440> the

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
actually the one controlling the

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:23.509 
actually the one controlling the
pokemons

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
pokemons

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.020 
pokemons
fuel<00:03:24.150> body<00:03:24.510> so<00:03:24.980> basically<00:03:25.980> the<00:03:26.220> decoy<00:03:26.640> of<00:03:26.850> the

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
fuel body so basically the decoy of the

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:28.910 
fuel body so basically the decoy of the
tail<00:03:27.299> is<00:03:27.600> the<00:03:27.660> one<00:03:27.989> that's<00:03:28.230> doing<00:03:28.380> all<00:03:28.739> the

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
tail is the one that's doing all the

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.729 
tail is the one that's doing all the
work<00:03:29.190> in<00:03:29.370> the<00:03:29.850> game<00:03:30.480> or<00:03:30.750> the<00:03:30.810> pokemons

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
work in the game or the pokemons

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.949 
work in the game or the pokemons
controlling<00:03:32.280> the<00:03:32.370> Pokemon<00:03:32.819> and<00:03:33.090> how<00:03:33.660> is<00:03:33.810> this

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
controlling the Pokemon and how is this

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.140 
controlling the Pokemon and how is this
backed<00:03:34.350> up<00:03:34.590> a<00:03:34.859> bit<00:03:34.890> well<00:03:35.400> simply<00:03:35.970> in<00:03:36.060> the

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
backed up a bit well simply in the

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.120 
backed up a bit well simply in the
pokedex<00:03:36.660> entries<00:03:37.049> from<00:03:37.260> gold<00:03:37.590> silver<00:03:38.010> and

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
pokedex entries from gold silver and

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.430 
pokedex entries from gold silver and
crystal<00:03:38.370> it<00:03:38.940> always<00:03:39.120> tries<00:03:39.420> to<00:03:39.600> conceal<00:03:39.959> is

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
crystal it always tries to conceal is

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.440 
crystal it always tries to conceal is
black<00:03:40.890> tail<00:03:41.160> like<00:03:41.370> if<00:03:41.519> it's<00:03:41.700> hiding<00:03:42.000> a<00:03:42.209> secret

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
black tail like if it's hiding a secret

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.319 
black tail like if it's hiding a secret
and<00:03:42.870> actually<00:03:43.709> in<00:03:43.799> some<00:03:43.829> pokedex<00:03:44.519> entries<00:03:44.940> it

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
and actually in some pokedex entries it

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:48.140 
and actually in some pokedex entries it
does<00:03:45.870> state<00:03:46.260> that<00:03:46.290> it's<00:03:46.709> probably<00:03:47.370> hiding

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
does state that it's probably hiding

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
attack it learns in the case where it

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.080 
attack it learns in the case where it

on<00:04:02.190> the<00:04:02.459> tail<00:04:02.700> it<00:04:03.329> will<00:04:03.510> use<00:04:04.019> destiny<00:04:04.560> bond

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:04.889 
on the tail it will use destiny bond

the<00:04:29.430> wobbuffet<00:04:30.030> is<00:04:30.180> the<00:04:30.330> one<00:04:30.509> that<00:04:30.659> has<00:04:30.870> all

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
the wobbuffet is the one that has all

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:33.710

these control over the whole body of

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.809 
these control over the whole body of
wobbuffet<00:04:34.379> and<00:04:34.409> it's<00:04:34.740> actually<00:04:35.190> doing<00:04:35.699> a

00:04:35.809 --> 00:04:35.819 
wobbuffet and it's actually doing a

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:39.499 
wobbuffet and it's actually doing a
pretty<00:04:36.120> much<00:04:36.680> crazy<00:04:37.680> damage<00:04:38.099> about<00:04:38.729> it<00:04:38.909> it's

00:04:39.499 --> 00:04:39.509 
pretty much crazy damage about it it's

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:41.180 
pretty much crazy damage about it it's
controlling<00:04:39.990> the<00:04:40.080> whole<00:04:40.169> pokemon<00:04:40.680> basically

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
controlling the whole pokemon basically

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:43.990 
controlling the whole pokemon basically
is<00:04:41.250> when<00:04:41.400> i'm<00:04:41.490> starting<00:04:41.940> to<00:04:42.330> try<00:04:42.930> it<00:04:42.990> at<00:04:43.199> state

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
is when i'm starting to try it at state

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.610 
is when i'm starting to try it at state
for<00:04:45.000> why<00:04:45.180> not<00:04:45.449> it<00:04:45.750> could<00:04:46.020> actually<00:04:46.229> be

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
for why not it could actually be

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:47.899 
for why not it could actually be
possible<00:04:46.889> they<00:04:47.250> why<00:04:47.430> not

00:04:47.899 --> 00:04:47.909 
possible they why not

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:50.300 
possible they why not
it<00:04:48.330> doesn't<00:04:48.629> really<00:04:48.720> mention<00:04:49.169> as<00:04:49.590> much<00:04:49.860> but<00:04:50.280> as

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
it doesn't really mention as much but as

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.820 
it doesn't really mention as much but as
you<00:04:50.520> can<00:04:50.610> see<00:04:50.789> the<00:04:50.909> tao<00:04:51.150> has<00:04:51.479> only<00:04:51.900> one<00:04:52.289> eye<00:04:52.319> and

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
you can see the tao has only one eye and

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.270 
you can see the tao has only one eye and
it's<00:04:53.340> actually<00:04:53.849> growing<00:04:54.180> so<00:04:54.780> it<00:04:55.190> could<00:04:56.190> be

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
it's actually growing so it could be

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.010 
it's actually growing so it could be
possible<00:04:56.729> that<00:04:56.789> winding<00:04:57.240> on<00:04:57.330> it<00:04:57.479> was<00:04:57.629> also<00:04:57.990> a

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
possible that winding on it was also a

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.800 
possible that winding on it was also a
pokemon<00:04:58.590> that<00:04:58.740> was<00:04:58.830> controlled<00:04:59.370> by<00:05:00.120> this<00:05:00.180> tail

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:00.810 
pokemon that was controlled by this tail

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.980 
pokemon that was controlled by this tail
which<00:05:01.530> is<00:05:01.560> interesting<00:05:02.460> but<00:05:02.759> this<00:05:03.569> is<00:05:03.719> just<00:05:03.870> a

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
which is interesting but this is just a

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.040 
which is interesting but this is just a
theory<00:05:04.409> and<00:05:04.590> as<00:05:05.159> you<00:05:05.310> may<00:05:05.490> know<00:05:05.840> wobbuffet<00:05:06.840> is

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
theory and as you may know wobbuffet is

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.540 
theory and as you may know wobbuffet is
probably<00:05:07.770> controlled<00:05:08.250> by<00:05:08.460> its<00:05:08.669> toe<00:05:09.500> yes<00:05:10.520> so<00:05:11.520> i

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
probably controlled by its toe yes so i

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.219 
probably controlled by its toe yes so i
hope<00:05:11.789> you<00:05:11.969> enjoyed<00:05:12.300> these<00:05:12.479> two<00:05:12.719> Pokemon

theories<00:05:13.590> which<00:05:13.800> may<00:05:14.129> be<00:05:14.190> a<00:05:14.340> little<00:05:14.400> bit

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:14.699 
theories which may be a little bit

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:16.700 
theories which may be a little bit
far-fetched<00:05:14.969> but<00:05:15.780> I<00:05:15.840> just<00:05:16.110> wanted<00:05:16.349> to<00:05:16.469> point

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
far-fetched but I just wanted to point

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.399 
far-fetched but I just wanted to point
them<00:05:16.889> out<00:05:17.009> and<00:05:17.340> they're<00:05:17.819> kind<00:05:18.060> of<00:05:18.120> interesting
