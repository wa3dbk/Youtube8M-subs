the<00:03:54.130> match<00:03:54.310> would<00:03:54.520> return<00:03:54.940> but<00:03:55.270> it<00:03:55.390> now<00:03:55.660> seems

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
the match would return but it now seems

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.160 
the match would return but it now seems
as<00:03:56.230> though<00:03:56.349> it<00:03:56.620> will<00:03:56.739> be<00:03:56.860> an<00:03:56.950> annual<00:03:57.430> tradition

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170
