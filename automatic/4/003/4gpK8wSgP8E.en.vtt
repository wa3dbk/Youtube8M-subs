 shrimp those things personally I get 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.900
 they do is a little disgusting to bring 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:36.180
 like food on the head very viscous the 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.160
 things stuff a bit of filthy plus 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.530
 that your hair does not end up smelling very 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.660
 well let's say there are some very things 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.640
 important that you should know number 1 the 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.500
 hair follicle is to say that little head 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.090
 black that each hair has is the 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.489
 in charge of hair growth and 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.530
 This one is inside the leather 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.300
 scalp so for more menjurjes and 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.890
 things that you put together in your hair is not going 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.079
 to serve a lot because the nutrients 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.149
 they must be absorbed inside of 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.070
 our body that we can do can you 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.480
 eat healthy and here I am going to give you 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.890
 four foods 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.260
 star that we're going to help 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.090
 our hair grows very long 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.340
 our first star food are the 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.869
 proteins some proteins harden 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.030
 to form the keratin that is the 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.770
 structure of a strand of our 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.659
 hair without enough proteins 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.820
 our body does not have those materials 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.070
 needed to create new hair and 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.880
 our hair grows very weak and falls 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.350
 soon after or grows very slowly 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.780
 so try to include in your meals 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.360
 red meats egg fish that are 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.580
 high protein foods or if you're 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.289
 vegetarian the nuts the beans or 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.090
 the soy products will come to you very 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:41.369
 well our second star food 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.020
 is iron iron is essential for 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.270
 the transmission of oxygen to the cells 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.460
 and help your body to use the protein 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.990
 to create a big strong hair 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.940
 Iron sources are also meats 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.130
 red and the egg but you can also 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.200
 find in lentils beans and in the 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.940
 green vegetables among more green more 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.310
 iron has our third food 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.020
 star is sensing the zinc that helps the 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.820
 body to grow and repair the tissue 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.500
 as our hair great sources of 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.509
 zinc are peanut butter the 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.720
 peanut and chickpeas and also what 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.580
 you find in red meats 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.230
 and birds like chicken in our 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.480
 fourth star food is the vitamin 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.400
 c Vitamin C will help us 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.560
 build the collagen that is a 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.120
 essential protein for the production of 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.650
 new hair cells without the 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.630
 vitamin c in our body too 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.310
 has difficulty absorbing the 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.710
 iron therefore is doubly 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.750
 important and where can we find a 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.880
 miss vitamin c well we can 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.760
 find in citrus fruits like 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.130
 tangerine oranges or lemons or 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.850
 in fruits such as pineapple strawberries and 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.590
 guava 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.450
 now we are going to another important point that 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.640
 you should know that it is 'number two' and it is 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.770
 than to make the hair follicle happy 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.660
 and to get to work and grow 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.520
 our hair must be stimulated with 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.350
 massage you can buy tea from these 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.820
 brushes that have massage balls 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.950
 so that brushing is not hair 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.810
 we are giving a massage on the leather 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.400
 scalp or while you're bathing 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.280
 with the shampoo we are going to give us a 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.870
 massage like this with this apart from 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.090
 relax you will help your leather 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.920
 scalp is oxygenated thanks to the massage and 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.810
 torrico that stimulates the blood flow 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.120
 making your hair grow more 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.860
 fast and healthy important point and what 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.870
 minus 3 so your hair grows 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.519
 strong and then avoid unloading 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.170
 in the pillow of those times that we see 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:19.060
 a pillow full of our hair 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.880
 and we feel like we have a hole in the 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.830
 head avoid as much as possible use your 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.989
 hair dryer and if you can not 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.940
 avoid using it at least use it in air 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:30.010
 cold and not hot air hot air 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.840
 constant in the scalp can 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.510
 weaken the follicle by making your 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.760
 hair grow more slowly weaker 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.739
 and opaque also tries to use the least 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.500
 possible spray or hair spray 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:43.420
 because it usually covers the hole where 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.610
 They are doing our hair avoiding 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.410
 that between oxygen another point that also 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.600
 you should take into account is that if you're 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.549
 taking medication if you're sick and 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.110
 you are taking baby pills and 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:55.060
 these things taking medications 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.040
 can also contribute to the fall and the 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.200
 slow growth of our hair already 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.910
 that some are very strong chemicals that 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.040
 although they help us fight the 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.810
 disease can damage other parts of 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.030
 our body that are weakened by 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.310
 the same disease and another very point 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.390
 important to take into account is that you 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.730
 move away from him 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:15.069
 3 run as far as you can that the 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.049
 boyfriend did you put the dal horn there 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:18.609
 fail, do your exam and your parents will 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.370
 they wait in the house with the chancla in the 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:23.350
 dalai hand I know it's very difficult to 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.240
 times being calm before certain 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.490
 situations but nothing will work 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.500
 if you wear everything aesthetic it's not like 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.300
 is going to fix the world truth just 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.430
 you're going to make your skin look fatal 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.130
 by stress and that the growth of your 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.840
 hair is encouraged and encouraging a 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.220
 little more what do you think if we better 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.440
 let's run to a park to 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.630
 relax and exercise to take out 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.550
 that stress that we carry deep inside 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:46.930
 us to lead a healthy life not 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.360
 it's only going to help you 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.520
 hair look super good but all your 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.560
 you're going to look spectacular when we do 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.650
 and we have too many things in our heads 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.720
 the stress the fatigue the unveil and 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.340
 the bad things with food today when 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.630
 I have to finish what I work and not 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.070
 I can go eat but here I have a 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.570
 cookie and I like to kill the 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.370
 hunger we are not parrots to walk 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.380
 eating cookies nothing else all this 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.090
 can cause our body to enter 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.040
 in a survival mode where 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.140

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:18.760
 superficial 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:21.070
 the brightness of the skin the growth of 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:23.560
 hair and blows as intense as 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:25.600
 of not sleeping well for a long time eating 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.550
 bad for a long time your body takes 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.889
 a lot to recover and return to his 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:31.000
