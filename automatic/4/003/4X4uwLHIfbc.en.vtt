 all our history a while ago 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.820
 back when it just evolves a 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.850
 syllable I met a boy you know that 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.070
 boy true father accurate romeo 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.920
 I remember when I first met him 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.590
 evolved into a syllable I left the 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.960
 caves of the 5th keys for the first time and 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.840
 it was there where I saw him not beautiful romeo him 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.970
 It was a little charm and lion instantly 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.610
 I fell in love with him but I got very 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.460
 nervous and I could not always talk to him what 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.860
 I saw walking around the caves as it was 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.009
 passing the time I decided to start 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.649
 follow it one day following it I lost it from 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:23.070
 view and I decided to look for it but I got lost 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:23.750
 I went to a nest of gray thanks to 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.390
 ground 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.150
 he noticed and rescued me with his powerful 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.760
 flamethrower at that time was the 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.190
 first time we could talk from 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:37.070
 then we became friends and from that 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.290
 friendship arose love but of course you 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.110
 you always wanted to interpose between 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:45.410
 we just because we are from 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:48.140
 different species but of course that's 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:50.869
 We did not care and we saw each other hidden 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:53.810
 from you with him I learned to love to be 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:56.240
 better pokemon to be stronger so that 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.360
 never happen again what happens that 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:02.119
 the day passed the time and the two 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.250
 we reached our final stages and or 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:07.790

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:40.220

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.220
 those of we showed our love came the 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.710
 day you did not find an exit 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.320
 you planned a trap saying that I 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:06.200
 I was kidnapped in the mountains where 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:09.890
 many rock- type pokemons were waiting for him 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.960
 which were not problems for him but 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:15.410
 then you did the worst thing that ever 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:17.480
 I thought you would father, that's what I 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.340
 He angered and we have a cold and 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.930
 you know perfectly what I mean 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:26.870
 truth or do you want me to remind you 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:29.120
 Good as you want, I'll remind you 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.760
 you knew what to do so you decided 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.370
 face it yourself and while I left 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.340
 with the other females to the mountains 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:40.220
 and you take this to face 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.739
 he does not know clearly what happened since 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.500
 I was not present but my best friend 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:47.810
 is the actor told me everything he told me that 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.450
 it was an awesome fight and where not 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:53.299
 you knew who would be the winner where you 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:56.450
 you won by cheat when he was at 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:59.329
 to beat duel you spoke to your 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.700
 slaves to help you and as a 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:04.790
 ball of montoneros who are killed him 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:08.599
 between 5 when I found out about that I could 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:11.329
 yes and that's why plan this revenge the 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:14.660
 which murders each of the pokemones 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:17.449
 I was disappearing them one by one all 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.579
 they wondered they were speculating 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:22.340
 who could have disappeared 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:25.340
 but nobody in suspect of me of the pretty 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:28.669
 princess of the innocent unable to kill 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:31.070
 a fly but with training 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:33.849
 who saw me romeo I could kill them 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:37.749
 easily to each of 

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:39.420

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:44.760
 and that's why that disappointment is why 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:48.450
 they kill you before killing you 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:51.060

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:54.240

 I will take care with my life they are the only thing 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:05:01.890
