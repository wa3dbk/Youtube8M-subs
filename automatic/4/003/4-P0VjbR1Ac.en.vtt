the top of the tower the new stuff for
the<00:00:55.739> 4G<00:00:56.100> LTE<00:00:56.750> is<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.870> lot<00:00:58.140> different<00:00:58.320> all<00:00:59.309> those

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
the 4G LTE is a lot different all those

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.220 
the 4G LTE is a lot different all those
little<00:00:59.789> tiny<00:01:00.030> orange<00:01:00.300> cables<00:01:00.809> are<00:01:00.989> fiber

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
little tiny orange cables are fiber

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.700 
little tiny orange cables are fiber
optics<00:01:02.570> there's<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.750> brain<00:01:03.989> box<00:01:04.290> right<00:01:04.559> down

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
optics there's a brain box right down

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.250 
optics there's a brain box right down
here<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:04.949> gray<00:01:05.189> one<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.750> up<00:01:06.750> top<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.110> break

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
here that gray one and up top to break

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260 
here that gray one and up top to break
your<00:01:07.439> panels<00:01:07.740> that<00:01:07.860> send<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.220> power<00:01:08.400> the

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
your panels that send the power the

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.170 
your panels that send the power the
difference<00:01:09.689> is<00:01:10.070> here<00:01:11.070> all<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.670> radios<00:01:12.000> are

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
difference is here all the radios are

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.200 
difference is here all the radios are
downstairs<00:01:12.740> these<00:01:13.740> we<00:01:14.549> actually<00:01:14.700> bring<00:01:15.000> in<00:01:15.150> a

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
downstairs these we actually bring in a

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.580 
downstairs these we actually bring in a
fiber<00:01:15.450> optic<00:01:15.659> cable<00:01:15.900> that<00:01:16.350> goes<00:01:16.470> across

fiber optic cable that goes across

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.460 
fiber optic cable that goes across
Canada<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.490> lead<00:01:18.479> that<00:01:18.659> comes<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:18.960> every<00:01:19.200> site

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
Canada a lead that comes to every site

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.920 
Canada a lead that comes to every site
and<00:01:19.770> we<00:01:20.549> bring<00:01:20.759> these<00:01:20.939> fiber<00:01:21.240> optics<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:21.840> the

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
and we bring these fiber optics to the

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.840 
and we bring these fiber optics to the
top<00:01:22.140> of<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.380> tower<00:01:22.590> where<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.250> radios<00:01:23.670> are

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
top of the tower where the radios are

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.999 
top of the tower where the radios are
right<00:01:24.030> there<00:01:24.299> less<00:01:25.020> loss<00:01:25.320> in<00:01:25.560> any<00:01:25.740> of<00:01:25.920> the

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
right there less loss in any of the

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.270 
right there less loss in any of the
systems<00:01:26.400> much<00:01:27.000> better<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.450> faster<00:01:27.600> network

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
systems much better and faster network

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.910 
systems much better and faster network
as<00:01:29.280> of<00:01:29.520> today<00:01:29.790> you<00:01:30.630> can<00:01:30.810> see<00:01:30.990> we<00:01:31.170> have<00:01:31.409> two

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
as of today you can see we have two

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:32.870 
as of today you can see we have two
sectors<00:01:32.340> down

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
sectors down

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.710 
sectors down
it's<00:01:33.450> oddball<00:01:33.990> cuz<00:01:34.200> it's<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.470> four<00:01:34.710> sector<00:01:35.100> site

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
it's oddball cuz it's a four sector site

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.210 
it's oddball cuz it's a four sector site
why<00:01:36.720> do<00:01:36.780> we<00:01:36.960> have<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.140> down<00:01:37.380> because<00:01:38.009> we're

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
why do we have it down because we're

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.789 
why do we have it down because we're
doing<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.549> upgrade<00:01:38.670> on<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.090> site<00:01:39.530> when<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:40.560> say

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
doing the upgrade on the site when I say

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.160 
doing the upgrade on the site when I say
we're<00:01:40.950> doing<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.220> upgrade<00:01:41.810> we're<00:01:42.810> improving

kind<00:02:10.280> of<00:02:10.369> chilly<00:02:11.050> I'll<00:02:12.050> turn<00:02:12.320> around<00:02:12.530> and<00:02:12.680> see

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
kind of chilly I'll turn around and see

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.280 
kind of chilly I'll turn around and see
one<00:02:12.980> of<00:02:13.070> the<00:02:13.160> towers<00:02:13.520> that<00:02:13.550> actually<00:02:14.000> has<00:02:14.290> the

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
one of the towers that actually has the

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:23.320 
one of the towers that actually has the
antennas<00:02:15.650> on<00:02:15.800> it<00:02:16.630> right<00:02:17.630> here<00:02:22.150> there's<00:02:23.150> two

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
antennas on it right here there's two

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.030 
antennas on it right here there's two
guys<00:02:23.510> over<00:02:23.840> there<00:02:23.930> they<00:02:23.990> actually<00:02:24.410> swapping

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
guys over there they actually swapping

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.340 
guys over there they actually swapping
the<00:02:25.130> antenna<00:02:25.460> that<00:02:25.760> broadcasts<00:02:26.360> a<00:02:26.900> signal<00:02:26.930> out

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
the antenna that broadcasts a signal out

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.620 
the antenna that broadcasts a signal out
to<00:02:27.410> people's<00:02:27.770> cell<00:02:27.950> phones<00:02:28.190> over<00:02:30.190> there<00:02:31.630> the

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
to people's cell phones over there the

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.050 
to people's cell phones over there the
little<00:02:32.750> white<00:02:32.990> doors<00:02:33.260> on<00:02:33.470> the<00:02:33.560> radios<00:02:34.060> that's

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
little white doors on the radios that's

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.000 
little white doors on the radios that's
where<00:02:35.270> all<00:02:35.420> the<00:02:35.570> action<00:02:35.600> happens<00:02:36.320> up<00:02:36.500> here<00:02:36.770> in

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
where all the action happens up here in

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.730 
where all the action happens up here in
those<00:02:37.280> radio<00:02:37.880> units<00:02:38.270> that<00:02:39.110> broadcast<00:02:39.560> to

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
those radio units that broadcast to

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.290 
those radio units that broadcast to
these<00:02:39.860> antennas<00:02:41.500> now<00:02:42.500> there's<00:02:43.060> five<00:02:44.060> guys

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
these antennas now there's five guys

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.910 
these antennas now there's five guys
working<00:02:44.750> up<00:02:44.840> here<00:02:46.120> bringing<00:02:47.120> it<00:02:47.209> all<00:02:47.300> together

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
working up here bringing it all together

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.430 
working up here bringing it all together
swapping<00:02:48.920> antennas<00:02:49.630> changing<00:02:50.630> fibers<00:02:51.050> this

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
swapping antennas changing fibers this

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.530 
swapping antennas changing fibers this
site<00:02:51.650> had<00:02:51.830> some<00:02:52.010> issues<00:02:52.310> the<00:02:53.150> fibers<00:02:53.480> are

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
site had some issues the fibers are

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.810 
site had some issues the fibers are
going<00:02:53.660> to<00:02:53.720> be<00:02:53.810> rearranged<00:02:54.550> making<00:02:55.550> a<00:02:55.610> much

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
going to be rearranged making a much

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:01.740 
going to be rearranged making a much
smoother<00:02:56.330> network<00:02:57.130> for<00:02:58.660> this<00:02:59.660> city

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
smoother network for this city

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.870 
smoother network for this city
originally<00:03:02.750> they<00:03:03.170> had<00:03:03.200> a<00:03:03.380> pretty<00:03:03.880> poor

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
originally they had a pretty poor

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.770 
originally they had a pretty poor
coverage<00:03:05.180> over<00:03:05.450> here<00:03:05.800> when<00:03:06.800> we're<00:03:06.950> done<00:03:07.780> this

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
coverage over here when we're done this

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.560 
coverage over here when we're done this
city<00:03:09.020> will<00:03:09.200> have<00:03:09.350> a<00:03:09.410> full<00:03:09.739> LTE<00:03:10.130> network<00:03:10.610> and<00:03:11.180> a

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
city will have a full LTE network and a

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:17.789 
city will have a full LTE network and a
much<00:03:11.780> faster<00:03:13.239> 1904<00:03:14.239> G<00:03:14.450> network<00:03:15.489> so<00:03:16.489> all<00:03:16.670> in<00:03:16.850> all

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
much faster 1904 G network so all in all

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:19.780 
much faster 1904 G network so all in all
what<00:03:18.799> makes<00:03:18.950> these<00:03:19.190> different<00:03:19.580> than<00:03:19.700> the

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
what makes these different than the

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.630 
what makes these different than the
