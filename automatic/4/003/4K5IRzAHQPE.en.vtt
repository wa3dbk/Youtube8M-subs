00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.759
 hello you, dear, let me know 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.490
 a new video and a halloween 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.650
 tutorial but not even now 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.710
 this mega creepy in germany 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.289
 but rather a bit like that 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.920
 American but with a small one 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.420
 extra 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:23.100
 if everything works out yes and that will be 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.800
 whole a pirate you see it already 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:30.779
 Headline and I hope you like it 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.690
 I'm curious if everything goes this way 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.190
 as I imagine 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:36.600
 Of course, I use it first of all 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.239
 a make-up and I wear it now 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.680
 just open your fingers if that 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.600
 is still just the fastest 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:47.640
 and so I think then I take 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.649
 concealer and asked in his three 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.170
 extreme on then is just the 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.370
 Just married and married 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.670
 then I also associations with the 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.469
 finger then I wear a brother to 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.899
 I always express that with one 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.949
 but that's natural to you 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.629
 leave and now with the sponge 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.080
 makes it easy or directly with the brush 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.210
 one works and then i pull the ones 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.799
 eyebrows after 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.590
 and today I am for the darker one 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.960
 color decided because I think as 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:20.520
 pirate of it by rome one may quietly 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.350
 have dark eyebrows and yes you see 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.369
 It's a bit more accurate than me 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.549
 Apply and I fix it then always 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:30.810
 with just a transparent go 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:32.790
 you could go wild now too 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.280
 I would come to make all the pictures 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.460
 know the but quite normal in shape and 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.479
 then put down the fighting city 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.150
 So just a sharper line 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:47.670
 is achieved and the brown bow 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:49.530
 a little bit lifted so is lifted as 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.840
 first color I take me then one 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.970
 gray brown actually a lightning 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.170
 register and carry that on the whole 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.170
 movable lid on 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.590
 and then I take a commercial one 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:10.200
 applicator and go with the thin side 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.870
 So with the edge in a deep black 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.830
 and that you can neat at the song at the 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.319
 a wreath on mine and I have to 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.910
 also not very neat 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.950
 because the whole thing will be right now as well 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.510
 so blinded 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.920
 I do that by using the brush 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.260
 Set up with the I already that women on 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.000
 I have worn and then I just go 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.980
 again and again over the edge over it 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.260
 the whole gets a nice transition 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:40.829
 and the black something gentler to brown 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:42.769
 a bit of the black goes over 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:45.209
 I then also down on the Japanese wreath on 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:49.110
 I do not associate that now 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:50.579
 because I think that is synonymous then 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.799
 I take a sharp black one 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:54.870
 kajal and draw one more stroke 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:56.220
 I take the channel because it is easy 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.400
 a bit smoother than one 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.829
 liquid eyeliner and also need 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.750
 I still have the kohl around it 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:07.500
 to edge complete eye so both 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:10.109
 waterline no and that's why 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.609
 I just took the squad then 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:15.239
 I do the upper and lower ones 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:19.440
 eyelashes and then the eye make-up 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:21.150
 also finished as far as I control then 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.709
 my face and take something from that 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.970
 bronze also easy on the sleeps 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.069
 so that's a bit too 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:30.410
 tanned in itself and looks like 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:35.340
 rouge I take such a flame colored 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:37.739
 I take such a fluffy mine 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.930
 I have lips in a rich red me 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:42.840
 think that it is typical pirate so 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.190
 this stereotype and I do that too 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.720
 now without a lip brush that works 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.069
 actually quite good but with limpinsel 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.069
 Of course it is neat 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:57.889
 and that's the way it 's done 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:59.530
 Of course you could wear it, too 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:01.700
 Now we make another wound 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.769
 I draw first where the wound 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.349
 should be about and then points 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:08.480
 so again with the same 

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:11.299
 black kohl so again nothing new 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.889
 of hats and then I take such a lip 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:13.280
 cream or a lip gloss or whatever 

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:15.739
 always 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.989
 and potty on the wound because that 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:20.060
 It's a bit wet though 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.639
 still not blurred and therefore 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:26.530
 That's just as good as me 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:26.530
 would say show or something to use 

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.800
 and then I take the deep red 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.389
 Lipstick and it also contributes 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.050
 some just put on the 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:35.050
 reinforce effect 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.599
 I'll go back a little bit with that 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:46.130
 black over it because of course now 

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:48.259
 is pretty covered and then take 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.599
 I'm a sharp object of mine 

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:52.729
 but of course not hurt and do there 

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:54.440
 such a scar purely because then you see 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:57.970
 such a slight clouding and that looks 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:00.259
 then it really looks like a cut 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:02.060
 and that's what it looks like 

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:04.460
 by the way, had previously practiced poor as 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.960
 can you see that because I wanted to 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:09.199
 I do not paint my face directly 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:12.039
 I did it and yes, yes 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:12.039
 then it looks
