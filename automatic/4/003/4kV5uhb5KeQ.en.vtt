it really does damage pretty well

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.330 
it really does damage pretty well
especially<00:01:06.810> in<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.289> category<00:01:07.799> it<00:01:07.979> does<00:01:08.189> it

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
well it deals it far a long range and it

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.020 
well it deals it far a long range and it
really<00:01:10.500> gets<00:01:10.649> you<00:01:10.799> those<00:01:10.979> consistent<00:01:11.369> kills<00:01:11.759> I

think that's what's key here the

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.169 
think that's what's key here the
consistency<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.009> the<00:01:14.159> IMR<00:01:14.579> bores<00:01:14.820> strike

00:01:15.169 --> 00:01:15.179 
consistency of the IMR bores strike

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:16.490

especially<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.979> original<00:01:17.520> IMR<00:01:18.000> it's<00:01:18.450> kind<00:01:18.689> of

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
especially the original IMR it's kind of

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.510 
especially the original IMR it's kind of
unbeatable<00:01:19.289> it's<00:01:19.409> very<00:01:19.649> consistent<00:01:20.009> gun<00:01:20.369> if

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
unbeatable it's very consistent gun if

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.099 
unbeatable it's very consistent gun if
you're<00:01:20.670> gonna<00:01:20.789> hit<00:01:20.969> most<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.420> your<00:01:21.509> shots<00:01:21.780> most

00:01:22.099 --> 00:01:22.109 
you're gonna hit most of your shots most

supercharged<00:02:10.560> you<00:02:10.679> say<00:02:10.800> it<00:02:10.920> takes<00:02:11.190> it<00:02:11.430> so<00:02:11.580> that

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
supercharged you say it takes it so that

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.460 
supercharged you say it takes it so that
it<00:02:11.820> does<00:02:11.970> more<00:02:12.150> damage<00:02:12.180> it<00:02:12.840> multiplies<00:02:13.440> that

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
it does more damage it multiplies that

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.380 
it does more damage it multiplies that
by<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:13.860> more<00:02:14.190> range<00:02:14.640> it<00:02:14.880> which<00:02:14.970> is<00:02:15.060> actually<00:02:15.360> a

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
by the more range it which is actually a

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.570 
by the more range it which is actually a
flaw<00:02:15.630> that<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:15.870> gun<00:02:16.050> of<00:02:16.200> head

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
flaw that the gun of head

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.550 
flaw that the gun of head
at<00:02:16.760> the<00:02:16.880> time<00:02:17.450> and<00:02:17.720> it<00:02:17.930> kind<00:02:18.080> of<00:02:18.140> multiplies

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
at the time and it kind of multiplies

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.260 
at the time and it kind of multiplies
them<00:02:18.740> together<00:02:18.920> adds<00:02:19.340> them<00:02:19.550> together<00:02:19.670> kind<00:02:20.150> of

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
them together adds them together kind of

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:21.550 
them together adds them together kind of
puts<00:02:20.450> them<00:02:20.570> together<00:02:20.690> like<00:02:20.930> a<00:02:20.990> really<00:02:21.320> cool

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
puts them together like a really cool

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.010 
puts them together like a really cool
you<00:02:21.680> know<00:02:21.770> kick-ass<00:02:22.160> combo<00:02:22.670> and<00:02:22.880> it's<00:02:23.420> just

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:24.020 
you know kick-ass combo and it's just

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:25.660 
you know kick-ass combo and it's just
like<00:02:24.140> a<00:02:24.170> death<00:02:24.590> machine<00:02:24.800> to<00:02:25.130> be<00:02:25.220> honest<00:02:25.550> you

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
like a death machine to be honest you

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:26.980 
like a death machine to be honest you
know<00:02:25.760> you're<00:02:25.880> gonna<00:02:26.000> take<00:02:26.240> out<00:02:26.360> enemies<00:02:26.750> it's

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
know you're gonna take out enemies it's

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.750 
know you're gonna take out enemies it's
accurate<00:02:27.260> as<00:02:27.800> fuck<00:02:28.130> it<00:02:28.280> doesn't<00:02:28.460> really<00:02:28.550> even

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
accurate as fuck it doesn't really even

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.490 
accurate as fuck it doesn't really even
matter<00:02:29.120> that<00:02:29.240> you<00:02:29.480> have<00:02:29.510> less<00:02:29.810> accuracy<00:02:30.200> on<00:02:30.380> it

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
matter that you have less accuracy on it

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.690 
matter that you have less accuracy on it
cuz<00:02:30.620> the<00:02:30.740> range<00:02:30.950> and<00:02:31.130> the<00:02:31.220> damage<00:02:31.520> put

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
cuz the range and the damage put

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.370 
cuz the range and the damage put
together<00:02:31.820> kind<00:02:32.420> of<00:02:32.540> makes<00:02:32.690> up<00:02:32.870> for<00:02:33.050> that<00:02:33.080> as

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
together kind of makes up for that as

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:34.480 
together kind of makes up for that as
long<00:02:33.500> as<00:02:33.620> you're<00:02:33.710> hitting<00:02:33.830> your<00:02:34.010> shots<00:02:34.250> kind

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
long as you're hitting your shots kind

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.220

of<00:02:34.670> consistently<00:02:35.450> which<00:02:35.660> is<00:02:35.780> what<00:02:35.930> this<00:02:36.080> gun

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
of consistently which is what this gun

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.840 
of consistently which is what this gun
is<00:02:36.380> a<00:02:36.410> consistent<00:02:36.950> weapon<00:02:37.190> as<00:02:37.490> long<00:02:37.640> as<00:02:37.730> you're

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
is a consistent weapon as long as you're

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.280 
is a consistent weapon as long as you're
hitting<00:02:37.940> them<00:02:38.180> consistent<00:02:38.870> you're<00:02:39.020> gonna<00:02:39.110> be

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
hitting them consistent you're gonna be

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.110 
hitting them consistent you're gonna be
getting<00:02:39.710> those<00:02:39.860> one<00:02:40.220> burst<00:02:40.460> kills<00:02:40.790> that

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
getting those one burst kills that

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.600 
getting those one burst kills that
consistency<00:02:41.900> and<00:02:42.290> it's<00:02:42.710> gonna<00:02:42.830> become<00:02:43.310> like<00:02:43.340> a

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
consistency and it's gonna become like a

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.270 
consistency and it's gonna become like a
