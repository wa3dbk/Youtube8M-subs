nice<00:02:29.910> and<00:02:30.420> if<00:02:31.200> we<00:02:31.350> go<00:02:31.500> ahead<00:02:31.710> and<00:02:31.860> compare<00:02:32.220> it

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
nice and if we go ahead and compare it

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.790 
nice and if we go ahead and compare it
to<00:02:32.460> the<00:02:32.550> candyshell<00:02:33.210> it's<00:02:33.810> very<00:02:34.110> similar<00:02:34.440> but

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
to the candyshell it's very similar but

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.580

this<00:02:35.070> one<00:02:35.280> has<00:02:35.490> a<00:02:35.520> more<00:02:35.850> matte<00:02:36.260> finish<00:02:37.260> to<00:02:37.290> it

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
this one has a more matte finish to it

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.970 
this one has a more matte finish to it
and<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:38.490> IR<00:02:38.790> blasted<00:02:39.530> unfortunately<00:02:40.530> it

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
and the IR blasted unfortunately it

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.270 
and the IR blasted unfortunately it
doesn't<00:02:41.310> work<00:02:41.990> it's<00:02:42.990> very<00:02:43.290> it's<00:02:43.410> covered<00:02:43.860> so

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
the infrared won't be able to pass

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.860
