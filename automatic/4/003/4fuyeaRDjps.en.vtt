cherry picked it's a flawless 9 and 0

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.960 
cherry picked it's a flawless 9 and 0
and<00:00:32.970> I<00:00:33.390> started<00:00:33.870> out<00:00:33.989> sniping<00:00:34.470> in<00:00:34.590> this<00:00:34.710> game

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:34.970 
and I started out sniping in this game

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.830 
and I started out sniping in this game
but<00:00:35.970> I<00:00:36.030> ended<00:00:36.420> up<00:00:36.540> switching<00:00:37.430> because<00:00:38.430> um<00:00:39.030> I

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
but I ended up switching because um I

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.540 
but I ended up switching because um I
don't<00:00:40.500> know<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.739> other<00:00:40.770> weapons<00:00:41.160> are<00:00:41.250> easier

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
don't know the other weapons are easier

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.450 
don't know the other weapons are easier
and<00:00:41.610> sniping<00:00:42.120> isn't<00:00:43.010> terrible<00:00:44.010> but<00:00:44.190> it's<00:00:44.340> not

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
and sniping isn't terrible but it's not

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.270 
and sniping isn't terrible but it's not
easy<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:45.450> as<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:46.530> can<00:00:46.649> see<00:00:46.680> I<00:00:46.829> fail<00:00:47.070> on<00:00:47.160> this

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
easy and as you can see I fail on this

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.569 
easy and as you can see I fail on this
guy<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.489> couple<00:00:47.730> times<00:00:48.090> switch<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.350> my<00:00:49.950> pistol

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
guy a couple times switch to my pistol

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.970 
guy a couple times switch to my pistol
to<00:00:50.700> clean<00:00:50.969> it<00:00:51.090> up<00:00:51.239> which<00:00:51.690> takes<00:00:51.989> me<00:00:52.170> like<00:00:52.649> 10

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
to clean it up which takes me like 10

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.000 
to clean it up which takes me like 10
more<00:00:53.129> seconds<00:00:53.579> so<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.750> pistol<00:00:55.050> is<00:00:55.440> pretty

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
more seconds so the pistol is pretty

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.920 
more seconds so the pistol is pretty
weak<00:00:56.190> but<00:00:56.460> this<00:00:56.940> guy<00:00:57.090> was<00:00:57.120> oblivious<00:00:57.480> and

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
weak but this guy was oblivious and

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.420 
weak but this guy was oblivious and
worse<00:00:58.140> than<00:00:58.320> I<00:00:58.410> am<00:00:58.559> so<00:00:58.770> that<00:00:58.890> worked<00:00:59.160> out<00:00:59.280> for

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
worse than I am so that worked out for

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.770 
worse than I am so that worked out for
me<00:00:59.489> and<00:01:01.760> this<00:01:02.760> is<00:01:02.910> about<00:01:03.120> when<00:01:03.300> I<00:01:03.329> started<00:01:03.690> to

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
me and this is about when I started to

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.710 
me and this is about when I started to
realize<00:01:03.899> this<00:01:04.110> map<00:01:04.320> was<00:01:04.470> pretty<00:01:04.739> small<00:01:05.009> so<00:01:05.039> I

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
realize this map was pretty small so I

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.760 
realize this map was pretty small so I
dropped<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.840> sniper<00:01:07.080> in<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.320> little<00:01:07.530> bit<00:01:07.649> and

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
dropped a sniper in a little bit and

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.380 
dropped a sniper in a little bit and
pick<00:01:07.890> up<00:01:08.039> an<00:01:08.190> assault<00:01:08.490> rifle<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:09.000> then<00:01:09.090> go<00:01:09.360> to

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
pick up an assault rifle and then go to

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.660 
pick up an assault rifle and then go to
town<00:01:09.630> with<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:10.100> but<00:01:11.100> we're<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.310> begin<00:01:11.549> with

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
picked up another one and um as you can

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.740 
picked up another one and um as you can
see<00:01:52.770> after<00:01:53.430> you<00:01:53.759> kill<00:01:53.970> someone<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.360> have<00:01:54.720> to

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
see after you kill someone you have to

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.200 
see after you kill someone you have to
pick<00:01:55.530> up<00:01:55.710> what<00:01:56.430> are<00:01:56.610> called<00:01:56.850> dog<00:01:57.210> tags<00:01:57.570> so<00:01:58.200> it's

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
pick up what are called dog tags so it's

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.940 
pick up what are called dog tags so it's
it's<00:01:59.690> like<00:01:59.810> picking<00:01:59.960> up<00:02:00.140> a<00:02:00.260> scavenger<00:02:00.710> path

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
it's like picking up a scavenger path

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.920 
it's like picking up a scavenger path
except<00:02:01.400> it's<00:02:01.549> dog<00:02:01.760> tags<00:02:02.090> and<00:02:02.360> those<00:02:02.479> are<00:02:02.720> what

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
except it's dog tags and those are what

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.670 
except it's dog tags and those are what
go<00:02:03.049> towards<00:02:03.409> your<00:02:03.500> killstreaks<00:02:04.070> and<00:02:05.260> so<00:02:06.260> there

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
go towards your killstreaks and so there

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.600 
go towards your killstreaks and so there
we<00:02:06.799> go<00:02:06.830> I<00:02:06.979> just<00:02:07.100> picked<00:02:07.520> up<00:02:07.610> another<00:02:07.880> dog<00:02:08.660> tag

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
we go I just picked up another dog tag

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.470 
we go I just picked up another dog tag
for<00:02:10.610> my<00:02:11.000> fourth<00:02:11.840> or<00:02:12.230> fifth<00:02:13.100> pair<00:02:13.459> of<00:02:13.850> dog<00:02:14.180> tags

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
for my fourth or fifth pair of dog tags

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.199 
for my fourth or fifth pair of dog tags
and<00:02:15.130> then<00:02:16.130> you<00:02:16.250> can<00:02:16.400> call<00:02:16.550> your<00:02:16.700> killstreaks

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
and then you can call your killstreaks

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.479 
and then you can call your killstreaks
once<00:02:17.480> you<00:02:17.680> accumulate<00:02:18.680> those<00:02:19.040> and<00:02:19.430> the

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
once you accumulate those and the

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:21.250 
once you accumulate those and the
killstreaks<00:02:19.910> are<00:02:20.120> three<00:02:20.390> five<00:02:20.630> and<00:02:20.660> seven<00:02:20.870> I

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
killstreaks are three five and seven I

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.710 
killstreaks are three five and seven I
believe<00:02:21.470> those<00:02:21.620> are<00:02:21.650> the<00:02:22.010> only<00:02:22.190> set

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
believe those are the only set

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.460 
believe those are the only set
killstreak<00:02:23.720> numbers<00:02:24.110> and<00:02:25.959> it<00:02:26.959> depends<00:02:27.319> on

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
killstreak numbers and it depends on

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.500 
killstreak numbers and it depends on
each<00:02:27.739> map<00:02:28.040> which<00:02:28.340> killstreaks<00:02:28.910> you<00:02:29.270> get

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
each map which killstreaks you get

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.030 
each map which killstreaks you get
because<00:02:29.870> sometimes<00:02:30.260> are<00:02:30.410> smaller<00:02:30.709> than<00:02:30.860> other

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
because sometimes are smaller than other

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.500 
because sometimes are smaller than other
some<00:02:31.310> apps<00:02:31.459> are<00:02:31.610> indoors<00:02:31.940> some<00:02:32.180> apps<00:02:32.390> are

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
some apps are indoors some apps are

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:33.940 
some apps are indoors some apps are
outdoors<00:02:32.870> so<00:02:33.050> the<00:02:33.140> killstreaks<00:02:33.620> change

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
outdoors so the killstreaks change

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.290 
outdoors so the killstreaks change
according<00:02:34.400> to<00:02:34.489> the<00:02:34.580> map<00:02:34.760> which<00:02:35.000> i<00:02:35.120> think<00:02:35.180> is

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
according to the map which i think is

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.690 
according to the map which i think is
kind<00:02:35.480> of<00:02:35.630> cool<00:02:35.810> it<00:02:36.739> changes<00:02:37.070> things<00:02:37.250> up<00:02:37.459> and

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
kind of cool it changes things up and

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.240 
kind of cool it changes things up and
although<00:02:37.940> you're<00:02:38.180> not<00:02:38.300> allowed<00:02:38.540> to<00:02:38.800> vary<00:02:39.800> your

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
although you're not allowed to vary your

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.430 
although you're not allowed to vary your
own<00:02:40.400> killstreaks<00:02:40.940> they<00:02:41.150> do<00:02:41.209> vary<00:02:41.570> maps<00:02:41.870> map<00:02:42.170> so

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
own killstreaks they do vary maps map so

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.630 
own killstreaks they do vary maps map so
it<00:02:43.070> switches<00:02:43.370> it<00:02:43.580> up<00:02:43.670> which<00:02:44.180> is<00:02:44.330> nice<00:02:44.540> and<00:02:45.640> also

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
it switches it up which is nice and also

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.710 
it switches it up which is nice and also
if<00:02:47.440> say<00:02:48.440> you<00:02:48.470> die<00:02:49.250> before<00:02:50.090> you<00:02:50.360> get<00:02:50.450> a<00:02:50.510> chance

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
if say you die before you get a chance

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.930 
if say you die before you get a chance
to<00:02:50.840> pick<00:02:51.019> up<00:02:51.200> the<00:02:51.410> latest<00:02:52.040> dog<00:02:52.400> tag<00:02:52.670> that<00:02:52.820> you

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
to pick up the latest dog tag that you

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.720 
to pick up the latest dog tag that you
got<00:02:53.060> the<00:02:53.150> kill<00:02:53.360> from<00:02:53.650> you<00:02:54.650> can<00:02:54.860> respawn<00:02:55.340> and<00:02:55.580> go

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
got the kill from you can respawn and go

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.090 
got the kill from you can respawn and go
back<00:02:55.910> to<00:02:56.090> the<00:02:56.239> where<00:02:56.660> the<00:02:56.840> dog<00:02:57.290> tag<00:02:57.560> location

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
back to the where the dog tag location

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.390 
back to the where the dog tag location
is<00:02:58.340> and<00:02:58.730> then<00:02:59.530> pick<00:03:00.530> them<00:03:00.680> up<00:03:00.769> again<00:03:01.040> after<00:03:01.190> you

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
is and then pick them up again after you

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.890 
is and then pick them up again after you
die<00:03:01.550> so<00:03:01.790> they'll<00:03:01.940> count<00:03:02.360> towards<00:03:02.630> your<00:03:02.660> kill

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
die so they'll count towards your kill

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.900 
die so they'll count towards your kill
streak<00:03:03.140> for<00:03:03.350> the<00:03:03.440> next<00:03:03.739> level<00:03:04.010> which<00:03:04.730> i<00:03:04.850> think

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
streak for the next level which i think

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:10.060 
streak for the next level which i think
is<00:03:05.090> pretty<00:03:05.299> cool<00:03:05.420> so<00:03:06.320> it's<00:03:07.160> a<00:03:08.230> it<00:03:09.230> says<00:03:09.440> just<00:03:09.980> a

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
is pretty cool so it's a it says just a

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.130 
is pretty cool so it's a it says just a
nice<00:03:10.220> way<00:03:10.250> to<00:03:10.459> make<00:03:10.670> it<00:03:10.820> so<00:03:11.000> it's<00:03:11.150> not<00:03:11.269> as<00:03:11.510> big

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
nice way to make it so it's not as big

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.330 
nice way to make it so it's not as big
of<00:03:12.170> a<00:03:12.320> deal<00:03:12.470> when<00:03:12.739> you<00:03:12.829> die<00:03:13.360> and<00:03:14.410> so<00:03:15.410> it'll<00:03:15.860> make

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
of a deal when you die and so it'll make

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.710 
of a deal when you die and so it'll make
people<00:03:16.610> want<00:03:16.790> to<00:03:16.940> rush<00:03:17.120> more<00:03:17.360> rather<00:03:17.570> than

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
people want to rush more rather than

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.900 
people want to rush more rather than
camp<00:03:18.049> which<00:03:18.290> is<00:03:18.500> another<00:03:19.070> good<00:03:19.549> thing<00:03:19.610> that

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
camp which is another good thing that

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.340 
camp which is another good thing that
dog<00:03:20.060> tags<00:03:20.329> are<00:03:20.480> used<00:03:20.600> for<00:03:20.840> since<00:03:21.079> you<00:03:21.170> have<00:03:21.260> to

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
dog tags are used for since you have to

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.530 
dog tags are used for since you have to
go<00:03:21.440> out<00:03:21.500> and<00:03:21.650> get<00:03:21.799> your<00:03:21.980> dog<00:03:22.220> tags<00:03:22.459> that<00:03:23.239> kind

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
go out and get your dog tags that kind

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:24.900 
go out and get your dog tags that kind

of brings down the camping
well<00:03:25.030> quite<00:03:25.450> a<00:03:25.540> bit<00:03:25.810> because<00:03:26.050> you<00:03:26.440> can't<00:03:26.680> just

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
well quite a bit because you can't just

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.980 
well quite a bit because you can't just
sit<00:03:27.130> there<00:03:27.160> in<00:03:27.670> one<00:03:28.210> corner<00:03:28.480> and<00:03:28.600> get<00:03:28.780> all<00:03:28.870> your

sit there in one corner and get all your
killstreaks<00:03:29.440> actually<00:03:29.770> have<00:03:29.860> to<00:03:29.950> get<00:03:30.070> the

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
killstreaks actually have to get the

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.070 
killstreaks actually have to get the
kill<00:03:30.400> and<00:03:30.670> go<00:03:30.850> out<00:03:30.970> and<00:03:31.530> find<00:03:32.530> the<00:03:32.680> guy<00:03:32.830> and

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
kill and go out and find the guy and

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.840 
kill and go out and find the guy and
what<00:03:35.080> I<00:03:35.110> just<00:03:35.350> what<00:03:35.650> just<00:03:35.860> happened<00:03:36.190> was<00:03:36.310> a<00:03:36.550> mum

what I just what just happened was a mum
I<00:03:37.180> don't<00:03:37.450> know<00:03:37.510> like<00:03:37.630> an<00:03:37.750> eight<00:03:37.870> kill<00:03:38.110> streak

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
I don't know like an eight kill streak

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.030 
I don't know like an eight kill streak
but<00:03:38.560> I<00:03:38.620> had<00:03:38.920> my<00:03:39.070> seven<00:03:39.520> dog<00:03:39.700> tags<00:03:40.380> so<00:03:41.380> the

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
but I had my seven dog tags so the

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.060 
but I had my seven dog tags so the
seventh<00:03:42.580> kill<00:03:42.850> streak<00:03:43.060> for<00:03:43.240> this<00:03:43.360> map<00:03:43.540> is<00:03:43.570> a

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
seventh kill streak for this map is a

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.430 
seventh kill streak for this map is a
super<00:03:45.070> maximum<00:03:45.940> armor<00:03:46.600> thing<00:03:46.990> I<00:03:47.140> don't<00:03:47.200> even

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
super maximum armor thing I don't even

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.160 
super maximum armor thing I don't even
know<00:03:47.620> what<00:03:47.710> it's<00:03:47.860> called<00:03:47.920> but<00:03:48.390> what<00:03:49.390> it<00:03:49.480> does

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
know what it's called but what it does

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.800 
know what it's called but what it does
is<00:03:50.500> gives<00:03:51.340> you<00:03:51.460> a<00:03:51.520> stronger<00:03:51.970> suit<00:03:52.300> of<00:03:52.420> armor

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
is gives you a stronger suit of armor

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.140 
is gives you a stronger suit of armor
and<00:03:53.080> it's<00:03:53.230> just<00:03:53.470> it's<00:03:53.800> permanent<00:03:54.400> and<00:03:54.610> it

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
and it's just it's permanent and it

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.070 
and it's just it's permanent and it
doesn't<00:03:55.330> actually<00:03:55.540> drain<00:03:55.930> your<00:03:56.020> energy

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 
doesn't actually drain your energy

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.440 
doesn't actually drain your energy
because<00:03:56.440> that's<00:03:56.710> what<00:03:56.860> all<00:03:57.070> the<00:03:57.450> the

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
because that's what all the the

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:00.080 
because that's what all the the
abilities<00:03:58.960> will<00:03:59.170> drain<00:03:59.410> your<00:03:59.530> energy

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
abilities will drain your energy

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.000 
abilities will drain your energy
anything<00:04:01.090> from<00:04:01.210> sprinting<00:04:01.780> to<00:04:02.080> the<00:04:02.350> cloak<00:04:02.680> and

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
anything from sprinting to the cloak and

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.030 
anything from sprinting to the cloak and
then<00:04:03.700> there's<00:04:03.880> an<00:04:04.000> armor<00:04:04.390> lock<00:04:04.900> or<00:04:05.260> something

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
then there's an armor lock or something

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.250 
then there's an armor lock or something
I<00:04:06.250> don't<00:04:06.460> really<00:04:06.580> know<00:04:06.730> what<00:04:06.850> it<00:04:06.940> does<00:04:07.120> yet<00:04:07.260> but

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
I don't really know what it does yet but

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.470 
I don't really know what it does yet but
that's<00:04:08.500> what<00:04:08.710> I<00:04:08.740> just<00:04:08.980> had<00:04:09.160> it<00:04:09.190> was<00:04:09.520> a<00:04:09.730> upgraded

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
that's what I just had it was a upgraded

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.420 
that's what I just had it was a upgraded
armor<00:04:10.900> suit<00:04:12.330> so<00:04:13.590> it<00:04:14.590> lasted<00:04:14.950> longer<00:04:15.220> than<00:04:15.250> the

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
armor suit so it lasted longer than the

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.010 
armor suit so it lasted longer than the
normal<00:04:15.760> normal<00:04:16.239> one<00:04:16.330> I<00:04:16.359> didn't<00:04:16.720> bring<00:04:16.840> my

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:17.020 
normal normal one I didn't bring my

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:18.930 
normal normal one I didn't bring my
energy<00:04:17.170> which<00:04:17.530> was<00:04:17.680> nice<00:04:17.859> but<00:04:18.370> it<00:04:18.400> went<00:04:18.850> away

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
energy which was nice but it went away

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.940 
energy which was nice but it went away
rather<00:04:19.450> quickly<00:04:19.600> so<00:04:20.290> as<00:04:20.590> the<00:04:20.770> highest

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:20.950 
rather quickly so as the highest

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.520 
rather quickly so as the highest
killstreak<00:04:21.340> for<00:04:21.850> this<00:04:21.970> map<00:04:22.300> I<00:04:22.630> was<00:04:23.260> a<00:04:23.290> little

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
killstreak for this map I was a little

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.220 
killstreak for this map I was a little
disappointed<00:04:23.650> and<00:04:24.660> as<00:04:25.660> you<00:04:25.780> can<00:04:25.930> see<00:04:25.960> it<00:04:26.140> says

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
disappointed and as you can see it says

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.770 
disappointed and as you can see it says
low<00:04:26.440> energy<00:04:26.860> that's<00:04:27.070> from<00:04:27.250> sprinting<00:04:27.780> using

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
low energy that's from sprinting using

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.870 
low energy that's from sprinting using
the<00:04:28.990> cloak<00:04:29.260> and<00:04:29.470> using<00:04:30.010> the<00:04:30.130> armor<00:04:30.460> that'll

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
the cloak and using the armor that'll

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.350 
the cloak and using the armor that'll
drain<00:04:31.060> your<00:04:31.210> energy<00:04:31.270> real<00:04:31.720> fast<00:04:32.490> so<00:04:33.490> this<00:04:34.270> is

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
drain your energy real fast so this is

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.090 
drain your energy real fast so this is
my<00:04:34.450> first<00:04:34.660> time<00:04:34.840> playing<00:04:34.990> this<00:04:35.200> map<00:04:35.410> and<00:04:35.770> I

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
my first time playing this map and I

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.040 
my first time playing this map and I
have<00:04:36.610> no<00:04:36.760> idea<00:04:37.000> where<00:04:37.150> the<00:04:37.270> enemy<00:04:37.570> is<00:04:37.600> I<00:04:37.930> don't

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
have no idea where the enemy is I don't

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.080 
have no idea where the enemy is I don't
know<00:04:38.230> how<00:04:38.410> to<00:04:38.470> use<00:04:38.650> the<00:04:38.890> mini<00:04:39.010> map<00:04:39.220> very<00:04:39.880> well

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
know how to use the mini map very well

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.460 
know how to use the mini map very well
because<00:04:40.330> a<00:04:40.360> mini<00:04:40.570> map<00:04:40.780> in<00:04:40.900> the<00:04:40.990> kill<00:04:41.169> feet<00:04:41.350> are

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
because a mini map in the kill feet are

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.650 
because a mini map in the kill feet are
switched<00:04:41.770> around<00:04:41.950> then<00:04:42.910> a<00:04:42.940> map<00:04:43.150> bottom-left

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
switched around then a map bottom-left

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.480 
switched around then a map bottom-left
killfeed<00:04:44.169> top<00:04:44.410> left<00:04:44.680> as<00:04:44.830> you<00:04:44.950> can<00:04:45.070> see<00:04:45.310> and

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
killfeed top left as you can see and

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.760 
killfeed top left as you can see and
it's<00:04:45.820> a<00:04:45.880> little<00:04:46.030> confusing<00:04:46.290> as<00:04:47.290> you<00:04:47.470> can<00:04:47.590> see

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
it's a little confusing as you can see

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.350 
it's a little confusing as you can see
on<00:04:47.890> the<00:04:48.010> mini-map<00:04:48.550> right<00:04:48.910> now<00:04:49.060> there's<00:04:49.300> a

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
on the mini-map right now there's a

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.090 
on the mini-map right now there's a
little<00:04:49.510> red<00:04:49.810> line<00:04:50.050> around<00:04:50.680> it<00:04:51.100> and<00:04:51.280> that's<00:04:51.640> a

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
little red line around it and that's a

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.700 
little red line around it and that's a
proximity<00:04:54.100> perk<00:04:54.880> which<00:04:55.450> I'll<00:04:55.900> go<00:04:56.080> into<00:04:56.200> detail

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
proximity perk which I'll go into detail

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.090 
proximity perk which I'll go into detail
in<00:04:56.830> another<00:04:56.890> video<00:04:57.250> but

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
in another video but

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.760 
in another video but
so<00:04:58.940> that<00:04:59.090> was<00:04:59.210> a<00:04:59.240> flawless<00:04:59.810> 90<00:05:00.140> not<00:05:00.560> a<00:05:00.590> lot<00:05:00.740> of

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770 
so that was a flawless 90 not a lot of

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:02.650 
so that was a flawless 90 not a lot of
kills<00:05:01.040> but<00:05:01.280> it<00:05:01.340> was<00:05:01.430> a<00:05:01.460> nice<00:05:01.610> flawless<00:05:01.910> game<00:05:02.300> so

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
kills but it was a nice flawless game so

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.790 
kills but it was a nice flawless game so
I<00:05:02.870> i<00:05:03.880> like<00:05:04.880> i<00:05:05.150> like<00:05:05.780> this<00:05:05.960> game<00:05:06.140> so<00:05:06.350> far<00:05:06.530> so
