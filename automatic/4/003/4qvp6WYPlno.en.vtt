modes are otherwise quite similar to
those<00:03:08.790> presented<00:03:09.600> to<00:03:09.690> you<00:03:09.780> with<00:03:09.900> the<00:03:09.959> biplanes

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
those presented to you with the biplanes

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:11.810 
those presented to you with the biplanes
with<00:03:10.830> the<00:03:10.920> exception<00:03:11.430> of<00:03:11.489> the<00:03:11.640> rather

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
with the exception of the rather

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.910 
with the exception of the rather
interesting<00:03:12.450> three<00:03:12.780> versus<00:03:13.170> one<00:03:13.410> in<00:03:13.650> which

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
interesting three versus one in which

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.440 
interesting three versus one in which
you'll<00:03:14.070> find<00:03:14.100> all<00:03:14.610> of<00:03:14.640> the<00:03:14.850> planes<00:03:15.090> are<00:03:15.360> the

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
you'll find all of the planes are the

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.810 
you'll find all of the planes are the
same<00:03:15.630> size<00:03:15.930> and<00:03:16.230> even<00:03:16.470> though<00:03:16.830> the<00:03:17.100> odds<00:03:17.580> are

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
same size and even though the odds are

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.550 
same size and even though the odds are
quite<00:03:18.000> heavily<00:03:18.239> stacked<00:03:18.600> against<00:03:19.110> the<00:03:19.200> single

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
quite heavily stacked against the single

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.199 
quite heavily stacked against the single
plane<00:03:19.739> I<00:03:19.950> find<00:03:20.280> this<00:03:20.430> mode<00:03:20.610> remains<00:03:20.970> quite

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
plane I find this mode remains quite

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.360 
plane I find this mode remains quite
balanced<00:03:21.720> as<00:03:21.840> even<00:03:22.320> though<00:03:22.500> the<00:03:22.530> three<00:03:23.040> planes

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
balanced as even though the three planes

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.400 
balanced as even though the three planes
to<00:03:23.610> carry<00:03:23.820> a<00:03:23.910> lot<00:03:24.120> more<00:03:24.150> firepower<00:03:24.570> they<00:03:25.170> still

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
to carry a lot more firepower they still

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.440 
to carry a lot more firepower they still
demand<00:03:25.769> a<00:03:25.890> lot<00:03:26.070> of<00:03:26.190> scalars<00:03:26.670> as<00:03:26.880> their<00:03:27.060> target

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
demand a lot of scalars as their target

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.810 
demand a lot of scalars as their target
is<00:03:27.570> so<00:03:27.720> very<00:03:27.900> small<00:03:28.230> in<00:03:28.680> conclusion<00:03:29.160> combat<00:03:29.670> is

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
is so very small in conclusion combat is

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.729 
is so very small in conclusion combat is
a<00:03:29.850> great<00:03:30.180> and<00:03:30.360> varied<00:03:30.690> game<00:03:30.930> and<00:03:31.140> the<00:03:31.350> variety

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
a great and varied game and the variety

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.650 
a great and varied game and the variety
of<00:03:31.769> gameplay<00:03:32.100> presented<00:03:32.880> here<00:03:33.090> is<00:03:33.269> really

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
of gameplay presented here is really

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.360 
of gameplay presented here is really
astonishing<00:03:33.900> for<00:03:34.320> the<00:03:34.380> time<00:03:34.620> with<00:03:34.890> a<00:03:34.980> mix<00:03:35.190> of

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
astonishing for the time with a mix of

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.759 
astonishing for the time with a mix of
different<00:03:35.580> Maps<00:03:36.000> fire<00:03:36.660> modes<00:03:36.989> and<00:03:37.320> different

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
different Maps fire modes and different

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.350 
different Maps fire modes and different
styles<00:03:38.070> of<00:03:38.160> gameplay<00:03:38.370> you're<00:03:38.940> sure<00:03:39.090> to<00:03:39.209> find

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
styles of gameplay you're sure to find

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.759 
styles of gameplay you're sure to find
something<00:03:39.810> here<00:03:39.959> that<00:03:40.080> you<00:03:40.110> like<00:03:40.380> rather

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
something here that you like rather

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:43.190 
something here that you like rather
shockingly<00:03:41.220> across<00:03:41.730> all<00:03:41.880> 27<00:03:42.420> game<00:03:42.600> modes<00:03:42.870> the

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
shockingly across all 27 game modes the

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.170 
shockingly across all 27 game modes the
quality<00:03:43.560> is<00:03:43.680> fairly<00:03:43.890> consistent<00:03:44.130> rather<00:03:44.910> than

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
quality is fairly consistent rather than

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.060 
quality is fairly consistent rather than
the<00:03:45.390> mixed<00:03:45.840> bag<00:03:46.019> you<00:03:46.260> come<00:03:46.440> to<00:03:46.560> expect<00:03:46.890> from

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
the mixed bag you come to expect from

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.370 
the mixed bag you come to expect from
games<00:03:47.610> that<00:03:47.880> sport<00:03:48.209> so<00:03:48.510> many<00:03:48.720> different<00:03:49.140> modes

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
games that sport so many different modes

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.500 
games that sport so many different modes
in<00:03:49.650> addition<00:03:50.190> the<00:03:50.310> vehicles<00:03:50.730> genuinely<00:03:51.269> feel

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
in addition the vehicles genuinely feel

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.120 
in addition the vehicles genuinely feel
different<00:03:52.019> and<00:03:52.170> aren't<00:03:52.470> just<00:03:52.500> different

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
different and aren't just different

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.190 
different and aren't just different
aesthetically<00:03:53.790> and<00:03:54.120> with<00:03:54.239> this<00:03:54.390> much<00:03:54.630> variety
