 Today I have to repair VAZ 2107 on 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:13.799

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:17.730

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:20.960
 general took this will do and so 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.960
 in general, unscrew the wheel 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.940
 so well pads 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:50.920

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:13.810
 right side to disassemble and so in general I 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.869
 removed the rear drums 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:20.470
 that is, removed the rear brake pads 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:21.100
 and that's what i discovered i have is the back 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.360

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:42.040
 on the brake drum, well, that is, somewhere 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:47.350
 there under the wedge shaft can be seen so that in general 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:50.820

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:57.010
 handbrake here goes to the pace of brake that 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.290
 the very thing that is here should 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:04.080

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:07.450

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:34.370
 There is no place just for the handbrake replacement 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:37.310
