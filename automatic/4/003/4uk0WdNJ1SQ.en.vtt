 I look forward to ending up being able to taste 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:17.090

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.199
 true focaccia yes of course we will make a bread e 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.039
 chocolate a very chocolate sandwich 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:23.359
 greedy 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.470
 let's start reading the ingredients 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:31.490
 thanks to our graphics for the dough 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:36.010
 a kilo of petra flour 5 300 g of 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:39.980
 water 200 grams of milk 100 g of butter 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:44.660

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:56.750
 drops 20 grams of salt 500 grams of 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:59.660
 filler paste 10 grams of yeast 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.360
 compressed and finally for the filling a 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.100
 40 grams of scented ricotta cream 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.740
 the flour is pure orange and 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:11.630
 bric ok today we use petra 5 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:14.360
 we put our bill bric water all over 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:18.200
 I am sure will be the six safe 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.480
 milk and carry my share and 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.210
 use as yeast 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:25.040
 ok that it is a dough with the 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.560
 milk without milk of a return not 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.190
 matter to us the amount of 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.230
 yeast comes from the fact that thanks 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:35.930
 right in this case is the I concept 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:37.880
 I recover what I have left 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.610
 that is, I did my major I have 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.140
 made some sandwiches and made bread 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.120
 I have a little bit left instead of 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.370
 throw it away you don't know what to do 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.170
 take add to the chocolate of the 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.090
 butter and how you will see the sugar and 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.490
 recovery also let's say this is the 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.500
 chocolate where you see it good 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.299
 practice and put in the freezer when me 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.010
 I insert my dough into a color 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:00.860
 reshuffle but also intrigue 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.690
 inside ok and getting all those 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.540
 we are the droplets that are fantastic 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:08.420
 quality was to emulsify the ricotta a little 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:11.030
 then you have the orange paste add 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.850
 First sugar icing sugar 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.760
 here too we must form first and 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:22.180
 gluten then we add ours 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.180
 butter sugar rises together 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.590
 continue to incorporate my ingredients 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.510
 the butter must be 16 to soft pomade 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.340
 soft 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:40.739
 after the time with the time always fat 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.739
 a little at a time from almost finished 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:51.570
 the butter I go with the salt 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:53.280
 now I control my dough 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:57.360
 samp is using a planetary ma 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.770
 absolutely yes when we see that the 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.990
 our dough is bound so you see 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.660
 it becomes beautiful many born elastic and 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:05.610
 glossy gloss if it is ready 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.800
 yes we say that now we can insert 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:11.400
 our chocolate 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.930
 slowly that if it were instead 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.870
 a little harder to just add a little 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.250
 of water than water as opposed to 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.130
 never add flour 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:23.130
 here this operation takes very little 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:26.280
 time to incorporate just the tip 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:28.980
 so as not to warm them too well 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.910
 see not tired from the hook 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:35.940
 wonderfully looks at a cast of 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:40.890
 chocolate not all attention 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:44.250
 a little he colored but he was certainly the last 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:47.730
 excuse operations born so please 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.690
 work better and this too must be left 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.560
 rest 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:54.920
 always for about 20 minutes and then we'll do 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:58.050
 our sufferings rest is 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:00.150
 very important agreement then it has 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.690
 Rested our dough is about twenty 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.760
 of minutes 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.890
 as you can see he relaxed a little 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.080
 also lying on our cutting board 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.300
 Now we can do the portioning 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.930
 let's take our dough e 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:14.730
 then serve hand pd score that 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:18.120
 if the wonderful mind we make 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:20.700
 of the small portions then we have 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:23.520
 portioned I try to keep then I do 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.440
 yes the game over very hot e 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.510
 working on it will cut and in this case it is 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.360
 determining the weighing for one 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:33.030
 balance if for cooking maranza of 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.890
 balance here very important and this 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.840
 weighs all of the same weight so ok 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:39.270
 we close again subject 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.740
 exactly we close and I point them out 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:44.760
 on my mom I do the same with them 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:48.390
 so he must do it so ok let's do 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:51.320
 last two three and two sandwiches 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:54.420
 in fact I put them directly 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:57.320
 nothing to rehabilitate from paper you paper 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:05:02.100
 we put them in the oven 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:05.750
 as you can see, I make fun of one more 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:10.260
 just apologize for this speed but 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:14.670
 often making them to me we randomly have one 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:17.010
 little more time maybe if the shape 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:19.230
 round do not like you can take a 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:25.140
 piece and make a sandwich sum 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:27.180
 Here we are, T-shirt 

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:28.740
 we use our light bulb oven 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.500
 on there are about 30 degrees 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:33.570
 within four hours we pull out the 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.990
 our product preheated one 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:40.860
 I sink to 160 170 gravity 60 170

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.620
 15 minutes

 the product must be ready on 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:50.370
 final result culture here here i 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:53.900
