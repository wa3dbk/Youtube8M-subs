well I was watching um I got a fantastic

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:10.890 
well I was watching um I got a fantastic
video<00:00:07.509> of<00:00:07.779> a<00:00:08.379> DVD<00:00:09.099> of<00:00:09.129> Derek<00:00:09.490> Trucks<00:00:09.730> is<00:00:10.059> a<00:00:10.480> live

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:10.900 
video of a DVD of Derek Trucks is a live

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.049 
video of a DVD of Derek Trucks is a live
fan<00:00:11.200> I<00:00:11.379> really<00:00:12.039> consider<00:00:12.369> Derek<00:00:12.699> to<00:00:12.789> be<00:00:12.910> the

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:13.059 
fan I really consider Derek to be the

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:14.670 
fan I really consider Derek to be the
great<00:00:13.449> a<00:00:13.480> slide<00:00:13.840> player<00:00:14.109> I've<00:00:14.230> ever<00:00:14.439> seen<00:00:14.619> or

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:14.680 
great a slide player I've ever seen or

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.120 
great a slide player I've ever seen or
heard<00:00:14.980> and<00:00:15.969> and<00:00:16.960> I<00:00:17.380> was<00:00:17.650> watching<00:00:17.949> his

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:18.130 
heard and and I was watching his

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.679 
heard and and I was watching his
technique<00:00:18.550> I<00:00:18.699> think<00:00:18.730> he<00:00:19.029> doesn't<00:00:19.180> use<00:00:19.330> a<00:00:19.390> pick

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:19.689 
technique I think he doesn't use a pick

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:22.170 
technique I think he doesn't use a pick
and<00:00:19.960> when<00:00:20.530> he<00:00:20.619> plays<00:00:20.860> the<00:00:21.160> higher<00:00:21.670> strings<00:00:22.030> the

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:22.180 
and when he plays the higher strings the

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:23.700 
and when he plays the higher strings the
thumb<00:00:22.390> comes<00:00:22.630> right<00:00:22.869> across<00:00:23.080> and<00:00:23.170> it's<00:00:23.530> all

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:23.710 
thumb comes right across and it's all

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.260 
thumb comes right across and it's all
the<00:00:23.830> low<00:00:23.980> strings<00:00:24.400> it's<00:00:24.610> fantastic<00:00:25.180> I<00:00:25.240> think

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:25.270 
the low strings it's fantastic I think

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.000 
the low strings it's fantastic I think
it<00:00:25.539> does<00:00:25.690> I've<00:00:25.960> seen<00:00:26.199> Duane<00:00:26.410> Allman's<00:00:26.770> sort<00:00:26.949> of

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.010 
it does I've seen Duane Allman's sort of

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.250 
it does I've seen Duane Allman's sort of
do<00:00:27.130> that<00:00:27.250> -<00:00:27.490> it's<00:00:27.670> a<00:00:27.910> really<00:00:28.600> good<00:00:28.690> approach<00:00:28.900> I

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:29.260 
do that - it's a really good approach I

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.099 
do that - it's a really good approach I
sort<00:00:29.650> of<00:00:29.770> I<00:00:29.920> use<00:00:30.250> the<00:00:30.430> heel<00:00:30.640> of<00:00:30.820> my<00:00:30.850> hand<00:00:31.180> to

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:32.109 
sort of I use the heel of my hand to

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:34.529 
sort of I use the heel of my hand to
keep<00:00:32.259> all<00:00:32.439> these<00:00:32.619> guys<00:00:32.969> quiet<00:00:33.969> while<00:00:34.300> I'm<00:00:34.420> on

00:00:34.529 --> 00:00:34.539 
keep all these guys quiet while I'm on

00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:40.049 
keep all these guys quiet while I'm on
the<00:00:34.629> high<00:00:34.780> string<00:00:35.140> so<00:00:36.089> I'm<00:00:37.089> down<00:00:37.269> here<00:00:39.059> the

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:40.059 
the high string so I'm down here the

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:43.379 
the high string so I'm down here the
right-hand<00:00:40.479> fingers<00:00:40.690> help<00:00:41.050> to<00:00:42.239> shut<00:00:43.239> these

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:43.389 
right-hand fingers help to shut these

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:45.450 
right-hand fingers help to shut these
guys<00:00:43.449> up<00:00:43.690> so<00:00:43.960> it's<00:00:44.769> exactly<00:00:45.159> the<00:00:45.280> same

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
guys up so it's exactly the same

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.340 
guys up so it's exactly the same
technique<00:00:45.819> he<00:00:45.940> uses<00:00:46.120> opens<00:00:46.510> there's<00:00:46.809> a<00:00:46.839> north

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
technique he uses opens there's a north

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.410 
technique he uses opens there's a north
string<00:00:47.620> there<00:00:47.800> isn't<00:00:48.010> very<00:00:48.219> much<00:00:48.339> it's<00:00:49.089> just

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
string there isn't very much it's just

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.660 
string there isn't very much it's just
me<00:00:49.989> I've<00:00:50.079> got<00:00:50.229> a<00:00:50.260> slide<00:00:50.530> on<00:00:50.710> on<00:00:51.069> my<00:00:51.309> left<00:00:51.489> hand

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
me I've got a slide on on my left hand

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.610 
me I've got a slide on on my left hand
so<00:00:52.059> it's<00:00:52.420> kind<00:00:52.659> of<00:00:52.719> nice<00:00:52.899> I<00:00:53.109> don't<00:00:53.199> really<00:00:53.469> have

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
so it's kind of nice I don't really have

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.379 
so it's kind of nice I don't really have
to<00:00:53.710> change<00:00:54.129> my<00:00:54.309> mental<00:00:54.639> process<00:00:55.059> and<00:00:55.210> because

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:55.389 
to change my mental process and because

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:57.599 
to change my mental process and because
I'm<00:00:55.510> in<00:00:55.629> standard<00:00:55.989> tuning<00:00:56.139> I<00:00:56.379> can<00:00:56.530> still<00:00:56.709> see

00:00:57.599 --> 00:00:57.609 
I'm in standard tuning I can still see

00:00:57.609 --> 00:00:59.669 
I'm in standard tuning I can still see
the<00:00:57.729> notes<00:00:57.940> the<00:00:58.600> same<00:00:58.839> way<00:00:59.049> on<00:00:59.199> the<00:00:59.289> neck<00:00:59.469> and

00:00:59.669 --> 00:00:59.679 
the notes the same way on the neck and

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:01.619 
the notes the same way on the neck and
and<00:01:00.010> you<00:01:00.819> know<00:01:00.879> if<00:01:00.969> I<00:01:01.030> hear<00:01:01.149> a<00:01:01.209> melody<00:01:01.449> I

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
and you know if I hear a melody I

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:03.809 
and you know if I hear a melody I
understand<00:01:02.079> how<00:01:02.229> to<00:01:02.289> play<00:01:02.499> it<00:01:02.709> from<00:01:02.949> from<00:01:03.639> just

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:03.819 
understand how to play it from from just

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:06.840 
understand how to play it from from just
being<00:01:04.059> in<00:01:04.239> standard<00:01:04.809> tuning<00:01:05.520> suppose<00:01:06.520> you

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
being in standard tuning suppose you

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.850 
being in standard tuning suppose you
yeah<00:01:07.240> yeah<00:01:07.659> it's<00:01:07.810> sort<00:01:07.990> of<00:01:08.020> less<00:01:08.530> to<00:01:08.680> think

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 
yeah yeah it's sort of less to think

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.840 
yeah yeah it's sort of less to think
about<00:01:09.100> which<00:01:09.250> is<00:01:09.370> funny<00:01:09.580> it's<00:01:09.730> good

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.360 

well<00:01:13.780> this<00:01:14.350> is<00:01:14.440> what<00:01:14.560> works<00:01:14.740> for<00:01:14.860> me<00:01:15.010> because<00:01:15.190> I

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:15.370 
well this is what works for me because I

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:16.860 
well this is what works for me because I
had<00:01:15.490> trouble<00:01:15.640> with<00:01:15.880> Rio<00:01:16.180> too<00:01:16.540> it<00:01:16.659> was<00:01:16.780> always

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:16.870 
had trouble with Rio too it was always

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.640 
had trouble with Rio too it was always
too<00:01:17.080> nervy<00:01:17.500> and<00:01:17.620> uncontrollable<00:01:18.310> when<00:01:18.610> I<00:01:19.210> play

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
too nervy and uncontrollable when I play

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.500 
too nervy and uncontrollable when I play
the<00:01:20.650> thumbs<00:01:20.979> basically<00:01:21.729> stays<00:01:21.940> behind<00:01:22.180> the

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:22.510 
the thumbs basically stays behind the

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.270 
the thumbs basically stays behind the
slide<00:01:22.780> I<00:01:22.810> never<00:01:23.170> I<00:01:23.229> never<00:01:23.350> sort<00:01:23.710> of<00:01:23.800> doing<00:01:24.190> this

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
slide I never I never sort of doing this

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.560 
slide I never I never sort of doing this
unless<00:01:24.490> I<00:01:24.700> get<00:01:24.820> way<00:01:24.970> up<00:01:25.000> the<00:01:25.240> top<00:01:25.390> of<00:01:25.510> the

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
unless I get way up the top of the

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.600 
unless I get way up the top of the
guitar<00:01:25.690> I<00:01:25.869> just<00:01:26.140> can't<00:01:26.320> go<00:01:26.500> any<00:01:26.710> further<00:01:26.890> but<00:01:27.580> I

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
guitar I just can't go any further but I

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.550 
guitar I just can't go any further but I
never<00:01:27.820> do<00:01:27.970> that<00:01:28.150> sort<00:01:28.360> of<00:01:28.450> thing<00:01:28.540> and<00:01:29.260> it<00:01:29.380> just

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
never do that sort of thing and it just

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.200 
never do that sort of thing and it just
it<00:01:29.770> doesn't<00:01:29.920> even<00:01:30.100> it<00:01:30.340> just<00:01:30.520> touches<00:01:30.760> the<00:01:31.030> neck

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
it doesn't even it just touches the neck

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:32.850 
it doesn't even it just touches the neck
and<00:01:31.390> doesn't<00:01:31.630> apply<00:01:31.780> any<00:01:32.080> pressure<00:01:32.110> until<00:01:32.770> I

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
and doesn't apply any pressure until I

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.200 
and doesn't apply any pressure until I
need<00:01:33.040> vibrato<00:01:33.340> and<00:01:33.670> then<00:01:33.790> I<00:01:33.850> can<00:01:33.970> sort<00:01:34.150> of

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
need vibrato and then I can sort of

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.810 
need vibrato and then I can sort of
pivot<00:01:34.509> against<00:01:34.720> the<00:01:34.900> thumb<00:01:35.170> and<00:01:35.770> just<00:01:36.640> rock

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
pivot against the thumb and just rock

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.790 
pivot against the thumb and just rock
against<00:01:37.240> it<00:01:37.360> and<00:01:37.509> it's<00:01:37.720> really<00:01:38.110> controllable

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:38.800 
against it and it's really controllable

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.590 
against it and it's really controllable
you<00:01:38.890> can<00:01:39.040> sort<00:01:39.280> of<00:01:39.369> you<00:01:39.940> can<00:01:40.060> really<00:01:40.270> control

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
you can sort of you can really control

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:49.170 
you can sort of you can really control
the<00:01:40.780> speed<00:01:41.050> of<00:01:41.200> the<00:01:41.290> whole<00:01:41.440> things<00:01:48.180> you've

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.180 
the speed of the whole things you've

like that eye-opening dessert

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.949 
like that eye-opening dessert
then<00:02:30.310> the<00:02:31.030> only<00:02:31.150> way<00:02:31.209> I<00:02:31.330> could<00:02:31.450> even<00:02:31.599> simulate

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
then the only way I could even simulate

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.570 
then the only way I could even simulate
it<00:02:32.290> was<00:02:32.409> with<00:02:32.530> a<00:02:32.560> whammy<00:02:32.830> but<00:02:33.129> like<00:02:33.459> to

actually hit the note with the slide and
then<00:02:35.080> when<00:02:35.319> we<00:02:35.500> when<00:02:36.159> in<00:02:36.310> the<00:02:36.400> guitar<00:02:36.730> but
