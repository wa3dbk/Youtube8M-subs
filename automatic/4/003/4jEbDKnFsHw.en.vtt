00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:19.100
 with action everything very happy for 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.939
 for the achievements that I had last year and 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.580
 now work with the same 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.860
 responsibility and thinking I have to 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.169
 overcome me every day a lot more is very 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.930
 nice that anybody quoted that they go the 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:33.030
 people identify and always give you a 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.620
 greetings of good vibes in the 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.410
 neighborhood that family that everyone is 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.649
 proud of one is very beautiful but 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.410
 Of course, everything has to be done with 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.600
 calm and with much responsibility more 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.460
 that many people know when is when 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.080
 it infuriates you if you do a punch today is 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.360
 the goals but no clay tecos are 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.640
 seeing many times outside the field - and 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.250
 what happens that when when it touches me 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.620
 play I give myself completely not 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.840
 I'm completely crazy with a lot 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.250
 personal professionalism and that's why 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.660
 It's very hard to be seen smiling 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.369
 in a field they will not always see me 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.770
 next to the claw with all the ideas of 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.470
 want to win and everything is the bread of the 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.060
 merconorte barcalÃ¡ is going to be a surprise 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.180
 oh yes oh yes exactly 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.640
 now he 's starting with the president 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.950
 and this time we no longer prepare 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.770
 for since it's almost a fact that it's going to 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.479
 be in your faith 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.159
 open if I'm not wrong so 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.700
 prepare with the same responsibility 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:30.380
 to try to achieve a medal the 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.869
 new additions we have this 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.360
 year are also very good players well 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.280
 that we know that if we train if we do 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.500
 things conscientiously and collaborated with the 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.719
 professionalism of the case we can achieve 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.270
 many goals you know and I think that 

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:45.530
 it is also known by the whole country that goes to 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.270
 see very structural changes in the 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.950
 Peruvian futsal may not be the 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.810
 same leaders as before with that 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.729
 message for them mostly transmitted 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.709
 that confidence that the team can 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.709
 play these results clear yes 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:09.440
 good faith that supports that they complement 

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:12.230
 more with him with futsal is a very good 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.940
 sport and that I think by putting a 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.860
 little bit more than we can achieve 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.209
 great goals here in the profile a 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.319
 greeting very well for all lovers 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:23.960
 of football and tell them that this football 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:26.420
 is here in Peru is 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.460
 more professionally and that I am 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.780
 sure in a couple of years we're going to 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.780
 make much bigger still
