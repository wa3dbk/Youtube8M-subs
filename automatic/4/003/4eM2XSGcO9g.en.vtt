00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:12.610
 things like 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.610
 that this is installed from the east 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.050
 now on this side 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.830
 which is similar to the others 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:51.270
 and from here to nothing and a lot and here more 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.270
 that is, these are the ones that have more 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:57.770
 little 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:59.210
 and if we put this here and they are all 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.370
 same to see let's put the more 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:05.770
 the same 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:08.620
 in equal to see you tell me 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:13.680
 I'm putting them all next to 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:13.680
 his partner are the same in each 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:22.300
 so that they are equal hey and if this one 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:26.820
 I do here and here to here with the 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.820
 which also as soon as there are more 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:33.000
 in this more 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.000
 now I have 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:42.820
 but this play dough is big not 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:45.479
 if it now accommodates the largest ones to 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.479
 the smallest 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:56.220
 this is bigger than there is the 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:56.220
 We put here but it's already put 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:04.449
 and in the little girl here is now put her 

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:08.560
 dish to each ball that corresponds 

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:08.560
 That little girl with whom she is doing very well 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:12.470
 very good analysis 

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:24.110
 to the exam so that alexis leaves there but 

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:24.110
 everything is alexander true 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:35.320
 sad not because I'm alive here very well 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:37.710

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.710
