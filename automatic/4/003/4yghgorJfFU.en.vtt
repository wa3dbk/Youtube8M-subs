diet<00:02:19.160> for<00:02:19.519> me<00:02:19.670> then<00:02:20.209> guess<00:02:20.420> what<00:02:20.600> don't<00:02:21.170> keep

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410

unhealthy foods in the house I know
that's<00:02:24.019> easier<00:02:24.470> said<00:02:24.500> than<00:02:24.890> done<00:02:24.950> so<00:02:25.790> it's

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
that's easier said than done so it's

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.050 
that's easier said than done so it's
just<00:02:26.330> me<00:02:26.510> and<00:02:26.930> my<00:02:27.050> fiance<00:02:27.620> we<00:02:27.890> can<00:02:28.100> do<00:02:28.280> that<00:02:28.550> but

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
just me and my fiance we can do that but

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.390
