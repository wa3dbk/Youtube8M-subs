00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.120
 hello and welcome today I present a 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:15.630
 trick on the rise of how to get out of the 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.970
 map and create a low barrier of the map 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.830
 The first thing we need is to stay 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.980
 with a zombie that runs more if 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.810
 it can be and nothing we stretch them up 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.730
 here we put ourselves here in the corner we 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.590
 we knock down and as you can see in the image of 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.670
 above we put the left towards the 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.810
 left and right to the right 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.460
 at the same time and that's it 

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.380
 bad is that it costs a lot to do it 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.300
 most times they killed us 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:42.600
 lots of times so I recommend it 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.110
 do it with a good partner now you 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.420
 I will show another barrier 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.820
 that since I was here, I'm going to 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:52.329
 teach a barrier that is also 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.870
 to show you the 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.760
 but well here you have it, you see 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.350
 the zombie stuck there and put here I know 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.110
 that he also stuck is next to the 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.180
 shotgun 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.840
 well now I will teach the trick that 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.899
 I was really going to teach you 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.079
 what is going to be going here here 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:15.370
 we are just walking little by little over here 

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:18.610
 well and we will fall slowly 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:20.470
 once we fall we throw forward 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.680
 forward we will meet with 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:27.970
 this we keep going forward without fear 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:31.600
 walking around here we bend over 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:34.120
 around here and we take everything and 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.090
 we keep going forward 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:41.780
 to 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.780
 This is a bit slow but nothing happens 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.180
 well once we have arrived then the 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:50.380
 zombies will not be attracted so the best 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.380
 is jumping to attract 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.840
 and well I recommend that there be someone 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:58.690
 out because what are the power thats 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.580
 you can not catch 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.870
 what are instant deaths to 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.520
 doubles point and all that can not be 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.400
 catch so if you have a partner 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.920
 out, it would be fucking true 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:11.390
 and well this is all I hope you like 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.560
 and nothing until soon 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.560
 no no no 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.709
 yes 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:33.379
 all right
