00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.639
 because good look at the beatbox 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.340
 monthly payments for the sixteen years were 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:15.030
 influences by by hours and that by 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.980
 friends with whom I mainly started 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.380
 very young in this hip hop and inside 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.500
 of rap in the beatbox take a 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:26.269
 trend of both digital videos and 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.650
 as I mentioned from a friend of my own 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:31.320
 basically it's like the beatboxes do not 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.170
 an ability to make music with the voice 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.600
 the culture of hip hop basically in to 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.829
 I was influenced by in all 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.350
 aspects 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.910
 well I'm a graphic designer and I 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.100
 It attracts a lot of attention the part of 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.780
 colorful drawings and all that in that 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.059
 then I saw the graffiti on the 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.590
 streets and it caught my attention because 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.360
 at the end of accounts it is also a way 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.410
 of expression that ends up by pulling or 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.750
 moving to the skittle 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.980
 other aspects such as what 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.450
 is the dj and the break I have friends who are 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.400
 fundamental in those aspects that are 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.290
 they basically devote to that but to me 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.150
 It caught the attention of the teacher of 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.130
 ceremonies not me I've always been like that 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.640
 I can not keep things 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:16.460
 silent and then I said not to access and hence 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.280
 I dedicated myself to writing and we make a rhyme 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.380
 of not so much basic nor rhyme by rhyming not 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.930
 because many tend to jump to rhymes 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.790
 basic and strenuous for rhyme not what 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.360
 we try to do this way in the 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.950
 case of blasts everything from my case you 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:34.100
 we make a structure as I said 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.050
 personal political partner but it is a 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.060
 puzzle way mode we 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.160
 we basically cheat the pieces for 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.289
 that in the end there is a coherence and a 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.229
 style impregnated in each theme there is no 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:46.970
 some basic rules to follow 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.680
 doing us but what what is 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.110
 must do is follow your own 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:54.170
 expression is to follow what one thinks what 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.570
 that one thinks personally and both of 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.830
 society and throw yourself like a little to 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.080
 themes 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.030
 that go in our country although they go 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.680
 within the hip hop culture to do 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.480
 some percussions with the mouth in the 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.970

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.680
