 Husband Nick who is your skin , or is it a code keeper in Final Fantasy today 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:12.030
 I want to send a tea ceremony 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:16.190
 Once upon a time there was Final Fantasy games also garbled meeting It is this type of mega 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.190
 A game day with some events 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:25.350
 I did something for years but 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:25.350
 I think that game has always been an app 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:31.560
 What a great game of heavy weapons! 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:36.040
 I think Tsu Rokkitsu 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:40.890
 I didn't play that game and I thought it was the same game 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:47.790
 I didn't put in, but when I put it 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:49.530
 Went logged Datte only tutorial not a Kaose and Na is Well next round because like a 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.010
 Feeling 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.480
 I knew 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:57.489
 clean 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.489
 It is Katya event day 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:06.019
 Skinner's character 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.019
 That the weapon is transcendence up 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.440
 this 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.520
 I'm the one I'm doing right now 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:21.829
 Well I thought that I came to play because it came 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.969
 I think first I guess normal gacha 0 normal fortune-I feel a little pull normal feeling 

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:24.590
 Or Let's Do the 

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:28.320
 To the star 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:31.330
 Since always Well stars 1 only out 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.690
 Because Well Mainja no 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.690
 but 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.490
 I also like to dance this squall 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.880
 Cipher too 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:58.399
 It is this Irvine in projects 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:01.140
 And There Do glad If the ball lands in any one of the three characters is because it is quite like 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:07.100
 Well it would be best if you could get a vine 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:11.420
 I wondered if I would do it for this purpose . 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.640
 It is three years I'd draw a Gacha or say I think the first time Gacha events 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.930
 Money 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.800
 I wonder if it changes 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:21.140
 What is equal? ​​R 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:26.410
 Since that mean r guarantee r Marvel and 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.410
 Because I think that r does not change so much with the brain 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.720
 me 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:40.610
 Well after Nde is the dramaturgic of suck tea came to a positive Rikai 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:40.610
 I think it will be a single shot 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:54.300
 Put out a gold ball 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.970
 Maintain 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.970
 Keep going and head 15 stars 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.150
 Day after death 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:07.780
 This is not my direction 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.780
 variant 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:22.640
 The or so went to wait wanted j ah ah # 1 comes out advanced to where the 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:27.350
 Pretty probability area that I think I want at least to do until there I'd kinda there is no 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:29.480
 I think it was 4 parts, so I think I can not close it so much I cherish this weapon 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.959
 I think that I want to use 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:38.510
 After that, it is time when there is not yet an Urban position 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:43.750
 Wakan when no I'm that I mean this weapon can be used might Well common sense 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.750
 I think that want to try a little experiment Nde no 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.470
 Because it is still early to onma 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:02.739
 Now it What is is equipped with 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.739
 Dancing Dagger 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:10.270
 Character twist corner 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:15.120
 I also feel like I can get it 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:15.120
 Because I think it is a character that can be a profession 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:45.530
 That f 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.530
 It means that 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:54.680
 There Oh 

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:56.139
 I wonder if I could not bear the decision 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:01.689
 with this 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:05.849
 At the time of other characters, it does not appear in the selection of weapons first , so it works fine 

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:05.849
 Is it equipped now? 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:13.730
