00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
competition on the west coast somewhere

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.219 
competition on the west coast somewhere
I<00:01:40.270> don't<00:01:41.270> know<00:01:41.329> what's<00:01:41.479> going<00:01:41.689> on<00:01:41.810> on<00:01:41.960> the<00:01:42.049> west

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:42.229 
I don't know what's going on on the west

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.249 
I don't know what's going on on the west
coast<00:01:42.320> I<00:01:43.100> know<00:01:44.060> it's<00:01:44.270> tough<00:01:44.450> and<00:01:44.659> California

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
coast I know it's tough and California

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:47.260 
coast I know it's tough and California
with<00:01:45.710> all<00:01:45.860> the<00:01:46.039> laws<00:01:46.399> and<00:01:46.430> restrictions<00:01:46.820> on

with all the laws and restrictions on
the<00:01:47.360> cars<00:01:47.570> I<00:01:47.750> think<00:01:47.930> that's<00:01:48.049> kind<00:01:48.229> of<00:01:48.259> what's

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 
the cars I think that's kind of what's

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:51.279 
the cars I think that's kind of what's
killing<00:01:48.710> it<00:01:48.860> over<00:01:49.100> here<00:01:49.450> people<00:01:50.450> can't<00:01:50.689> have<00:01:51.259> a

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:51.289 
killing it over here people can't have a

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:52.450 
killing it over here people can't have a
car<00:01:51.590> that<00:01:51.619> they<00:01:51.890> can<00:01:52.009> drive<00:01:52.189> on<00:01:52.340> the<00:01:52.399> street

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
car that they can drive on the street

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:53.679 
car that they can drive on the street
taking<00:01:52.939> track<00:01:53.179> so<00:01:53.360> it<00:01:53.420> makes<00:01:53.539> it<00:01:53.630> difficult

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
taking track so it makes it difficult

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:55.209 
taking track so it makes it difficult
you<00:01:54.200> pretty<00:01:54.350> much<00:01:54.470> have<00:01:54.679> to<00:01:54.770> have<00:01:54.920> a<00:01:55.009> dedicated

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:55.219 
you pretty much have to have a dedicated

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:57.279 
you pretty much have to have a dedicated
trap<00:01:55.729> card<00:01:56.000> here<00:01:56.179> and<00:01:56.750> all<00:01:56.869> the<00:01:56.929> tracks<00:01:57.170> are

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289 
trap card here and all the tracks are

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:59.859 
trap card here and all the tracks are
shut<00:01:57.470> down<00:01:57.500> Callie<00:01:57.979> so<00:01:58.310> it's<00:01:59.179> not<00:01:59.299> a<00:01:59.360> lot<00:01:59.569> left

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869
