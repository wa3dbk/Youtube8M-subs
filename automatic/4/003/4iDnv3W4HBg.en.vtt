00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.350 
was rather amusing after the fact during
it<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:40.799> was<00:01:40.950> kind<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.250> scared<00:01:41.820> that<00:01:42.240> we<00:01:42.329> were

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
it I was kind of scared that we were

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.080 
it I was kind of scared that we were
gonna<00:01:42.570> something<00:01:43.470> bad<00:01:43.590> was<00:01:43.770> gonna<00:01:43.829> happen<00:01:44.090> but

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
gonna something bad was gonna happen but

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.389 
gonna something bad was gonna happen but
regardless<00:01:45.420> we<00:01:45.540> got<00:01:45.750> out<00:01:45.930> of<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.290> no<00:01:47.070> we<00:01:47.280> do

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
regardless we got out of it and no we do

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.870 
regardless we got out of it and no we do
not<00:01:47.520> use<00:01:47.700> jammers<00:01:49.130> we<00:01:50.130> do<00:01:50.250> use<00:01:50.490> radar

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
not use jammers we do use radar

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.550 
not use jammers we do use radar
detectors<00:01:51.420> on<00:01:51.689> occasion<00:01:52.140> when<00:01:52.259> we<00:01:52.350> need<00:01:52.530> to

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
detectors on occasion when we need to

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.219 
detectors on occasion when we need to
evidently<00:01:53.460> we<00:01:53.729> were<00:01:53.880> not<00:01:54.060> using<00:01:54.299> one<00:01:54.630> that<00:01:54.960> day

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
evidently we were not using one that day

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.709 
evidently we were not using one that day
so<00:01:55.290> that<00:01:55.740> happened<00:01:56.100> but<00:01:56.219> we<00:01:56.369> got<00:01:56.549> off<00:01:56.729> and

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
so that happened but we got off and

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.440 
so that happened but we got off and
basically<00:01:58.079> we<00:01:58.259> just<00:01:58.290> go<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.450> secluded

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
basically we just go to secluded

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.450 
basically we just go to secluded
locations<00:02:01.079> we<00:02:01.350> try<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.619> get<00:02:01.770> away<00:02:01.890> from<00:02:02.040> as

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
locations we try to get away from as

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.940 
locations we try to get away from as
many<00:02:02.909> people<00:02:03.299> as<00:02:03.390> possible<00:02:03.450> with<00:02:04.110> us<00:02:04.229> as<00:02:04.380> few

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
many people as possible with us as few

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.859 
many people as possible with us as few
traffic<00:02:05.250> lights<00:02:05.579> as<00:02:05.729> possible<00:02:06.240> we<00:02:06.420> generally

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
traffic lights as possible we generally

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.380 
traffic lights as possible we generally
scout<00:02:07.140> out<00:02:07.290> locations<00:02:07.320> beforehand<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.520> you

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
scout out locations beforehand and you

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.240 
scout out locations beforehand and you
know<00:02:09.509> just<00:02:09.780> simple<00:02:10.590> things<00:02:10.619> like<00:02:10.950> that<00:02:11.099> we

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
know just simple things like that we

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.330 
know just simple things like that we
don't<00:02:11.370> go<00:02:11.520> shooting<00:02:11.670> and

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
don't go shooting and

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.210 
don't go shooting and
populated<00:02:13.030> residential<00:02:13.690> areas<00:02:14.230> to<00:02:14.950> answer<00:02:15.190> a
