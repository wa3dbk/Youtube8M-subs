00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.339
 hi girls raniero video today will be up 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:08.750
 this smashbox primer 

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:11.300
 photofinishing hybrid and hyde primer 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.290
 this first with a very long name 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:17.310
 practically a problem that serves for 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:20.100
 the very delicate area below where we have 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.250
 the glasses and below the locchi so it is 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.019
 practically what makes the area hydrate and does 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.869
 so that our curator does not go to the 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.000
 folds and the idea evacuating signal because 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.859
 because it allows us to use less cream 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.130
 moisturizing juve while many usually 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.840
 is really the number one reason for the 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.040
 which our corrector goes in 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.100
 folds because they are usually a lot 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.719
 very heavy fat 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.270
 When we put virtually 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.149
 our corrector poor beast arrives 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.230
 in fact folds usually 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.390
 they advise above all why not so much 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.160
 so much so that it is to use a gel not one 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.510
 But this cream under the eyes 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.309
 product a little bit anyway goes 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:04.949
 solve this problem in fact hydrates 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:07.290
 and is slightly illuminating while that 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.080
 however it is slightly reflective too 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.189
 they are inside straw and nothing is 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.409
 what ours when he puts it 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.080
 under the eyes is that it is very light it is 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.830
 yes moisturizing and when I put the 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.610
 checker I notice that he sticks 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.460
 better just like taken like it was 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:31.470
 honey for bees is exemplified 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:34.380
 multimedia dock not very slightly ne 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:44.250
 puts the dome stand up a little , then there 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:46.259
 puts under the concealer is not not 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.600
 miraculous in the sense that a minimum 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.659
 however the concealer goes into the folds 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.530
 if our license is fixed well and if 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.780
 not it 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.180
 work well but much less respect 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.409
 al calÃ² for example where it does not put it 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.240
 the money is proof so we do too 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.659
 with an eye without to see the 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.390
 difference within a couple of hours is 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.370
 especially useful for those girls not 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.539
 for those who have the collector problem 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.209
 that goes in the folds but also for those who have 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.410
 the problem that corrector after a while 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.360
 then vanishes and the glasses come back 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.670
 out more overbearingly than before 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:20.630
 because in any case he fixes it much better 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:23.420
 inside there are 10 ml of product e 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:26.990
 the price of 24 euros 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.810
 the very good effect you see my vote 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:33.410
 so for this product it is roll of 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.590
 drums 8 the reduced because it is a 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.780
 very valid product as I said not 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.989
 prevents one hundred percent for ad 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.450
 go into the folds but fix it 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.220
 much better and in any case minimizes that 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.420
 problem at least 50 percent 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.420
 hello guys
