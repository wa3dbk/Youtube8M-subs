something<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:52.530> might<00:00:52.890> want<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.370> take<00:00:53.789> into

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
something you might want to take into

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.920 
something you might want to take into
account<00:00:54.329> is<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:56.300> cultivator<00:00:57.300> kit<00:00:57.600> might

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
account is that a cultivator kit might

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.630 
account is that a cultivator kit might
be<00:00:58.140> next<00:00:58.379> so<00:00:58.739> if<00:00:58.980> you<00:00:59.100> were<00:00:59.219> thinking<00:00:59.609> about

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
be next so if you were thinking about

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.090 
be next so if you were thinking about
buying<00:01:00.030> it<00:01:00.329> I<00:01:00.480> would<00:01:00.870> definitely<00:01:01.079> get<00:01:01.649> on<00:01:01.859> that

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
buying it I would definitely get on that

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.729 
buying it I would definitely get on that
because<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:03.329> might<00:01:03.809> not<00:01:04.019> be<00:01:04.080> here<00:01:04.500> forever

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
because it might not be here forever
