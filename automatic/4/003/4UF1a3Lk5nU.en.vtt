00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.049
 as you have seen with the title does more 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.969
 in the introduction of the videos is that 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:18.220
 I'm going to talk about how they started in lolita 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:19.750
 If you want to know what is reedited for me 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.369
 personal level 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:23.650
 I made a video of the first ones that I made 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:27.279
 here with the channel then I'll tell you 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:29.020
 I leave here in safety what is a video 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:30.550
 a little special where I do not count what 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.140
 today he told today that he will continue 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.170
 strictly speaking yes although I give you 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:38.410
 they are my point of view 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.420
 lolita in the middle is a subculture that 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.829
 comes from Japan they are 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.440
 interpreting our past ready 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:45.640
 critic analyzing it yet 'I do not eat it 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.109
 thing that your culture today 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.929
 they managed to do what today 

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:52.059
 we know how lolÃ­n japan was inspired by 

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:55.059
 the aristocratic centuries that is crazy 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.829
 as victorian western 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:59.440
 practically Europeans we could say 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:01.949
 because the court of risso the inverse reads is 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.809
 the court up victory this image so 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.990
 I 've only seen more romantic movies there 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:10.890
 of those palaces those infinite dresses 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.909
 so many details that romanticism is 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.150
 will consolidate with the beautiful part not the 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:16.370
 part d 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.990
 that the plague of the bald people of the 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.420
 poverty that that part did not stay with 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:24.140
 Republican that shines and make them 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.060
 counting on elements rather than their 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.590
 culture did a little bit what we could the 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.510
 already weak city of chopped list 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.970
 it is still not known exactly how 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.070
 came the hour there are ideas ideas that 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.870
 go back to the 70s when it started 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.820
 gestar to manufacture a subculture is not 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.440
 would create the morning so that you and you 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.560
 we believe their cultures and because we have 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.990
 controlled was not created so there is already a 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.340
 revolution process because also when 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.650
 we talk about the costumes that is a part 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.570
 very important of this and we talked about the 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.729
 part in fashion is that I'm talking about 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.100
 the subculture part a subculture of 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:57.380
 new a lot of things and in a 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.180
 sculpture somewhere artistic a 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.890
 part in this case for example the most 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.440
 striking is the fashion includes a 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.720
 social philosophical part that this has 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.970
 Revolution imagine where he began 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.800
 forge the girls that started 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.870
 take it and they were the ones that at the time 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.670
 they said we do not want to follow this role that 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.700
 imposed on society we do not want 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.520
 that perfect woman who so much premium 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.680
 she is a perfect housewife wife of his 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.410
 husband and if you do not do what they 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.269
 they wanted they were liberated by an army 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.489
 it was also what has to do with the part 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:29.989
 of cultural partner don hamponio is 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.459
 going through an economic movement 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.370
 the people that are seeing in the 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:36.080
 moment in the country in an account that 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.489
 section everything that marked their 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.459
 older brothers had done that 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:42.730
 I had served for nothing they wanted 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.510
 break all that a very movement 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.069
 revolutionary 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:50.769
 very fast in a certain way 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:53.260
 women with princes' pools 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:55.420
 men with dresses and women with 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.829
 dresses that were not what the 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.469
 associated ago he had marked is 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:01.269
 really break a beam whatever you want and 

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:03.159
 possibly as tickets to the street 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:05.889
 with this clothes you are going to look back it would be 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:07.569
 give something is going to happen to you that you do not 

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:09.879
 He is wearing jeans but would like 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:11.379
 yes because society as it is 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:13.090
 returns for something that understands it with 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:15.939
 something that I have not wanted since I was little 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.680
 it's okay he disowned it because he feels 

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:20.430
 uncomfortable you do not understand it if you do not 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.709
 he understands that making the cup 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.569
 in short let's say that the first ones are 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.329
 very brave girls even to day of 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:30.930
 today the current balls we also have 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:32.819
 that being very brave did not come from that 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:35.069
 time those that arose other 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:36.930
 as many as jazz could be 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:38.400
 action more or less at the same time we can not 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.930
 go to have a lot to see groups 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.359
 views have always had a horde of 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.939
 followers who dressed 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:47.340
 resembling group images 

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:49.349
 one of the most influential groups that does not 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.909
 the creators because that is also a 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:53.099
 failures I'm saying get many 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:55.169
 things because a person dresses like that 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:57.269
 is the creator perhaps is a big driver 

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:59.760
 because it makes it reach many people 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:02.910
 after a chair that what is 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:05.430
 talking maybe you know about healthy manga 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.680
 this gentleman is a gentleman that you see here 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.810
 this gentleman prescribes that of component 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.000
 of the Weiser mothers group has already 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.100
 disappeared that were the first 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.950
 The more the movement is encouraged, the 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.360
 done I knew lolita you try fisher 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.130
 if you want to know them a little more look 

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.750
 advice but here not 2000 or pizza we 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.700
 very solid proposal problem in the 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.340
 aesthetics you'll see what I'm talking about xxi 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.930
 you will start will not put dates also 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.580
 we could say that the other pillars 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.680
 most important in the diet was and it's not going 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:36.540
 nothing comfortable that was a bit the one 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:38.460
 wrote the most philosophical part achieves 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.260
 tanimoto called with the nickname of 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:44.660
 bard to lolita in a hand 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.660
 let's say that putting together the social part 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.750
 static
