00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:09.590
 or the girls as you know we have done 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:12.170
 a collaboration with ghd on the blog and os 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:15.949
 I want to present these plates that are 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.810
 new and they're called wonderland ballet in 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:19.910
 this case are the same as the classic ones 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.550
 the only thing that I keep noticing that the 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.190
 another is matte and satiny is so 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:28.280
 so much when I'm going to slip to make myself 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:31.310
 the wave because I touch it slides with more 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:33.770
 easy facility well if you like the 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.659
 effect I invite you to stay and see 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.359
 the video and thank you very much for 

00:00:35.659 --> 00:00:40.819
 accompany me well because the first step 

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:42.850
 let's do is divide the hair into 

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:44.859
 two sections 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.440
 and in this case as I have a little hair 

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:49.690
 Well, I do not have to do both 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.449
 sections but if you have more amount of 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:55.269
 longer hair you can divide us more 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:56.900
 good sessions the first would be in the 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:59.780
 temples 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:02.240
 more or less if you have bangs as it is 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.010
 better that I reid you with a pair of tweezers 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.890
 small and let it go for the last 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:10.790
 good step once we have the but 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:13.100
 divided into two parts we begin with the 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:15.110
 first strand more or less this thickness 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.200
 that is not a lot of quantity because if not 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.090
 the wave is not totally defined 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.890
 good at the beginning, it costs, but the 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:26.500
 iron always has to be towards 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:31.920
 up parallel to our head 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:35.550
 we use it more or less in half 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:38.700
 we turn the iron 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:41.120
 and the lock always like looking towards 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.120
 the ground 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:48.710
 diagonally 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:50.600
 and we get lambda I like it more 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:54.230
 fine natural with playing hat 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:58.130
 loose good once we have the part already 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:02:00.590
 bottom already finished as we take the 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:05.050
 top and the same thing that we did 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.050
 before we separated them into 2 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:13.560
 this side we hold with pizza 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:17.940
 good if in your case the bangs 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.590
 like me because more or less makes the 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:24.599
 sona 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:26.670
 up to the ear you see the line roughly 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:29.459
 I rest him 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.319
 you have to keep in mind that the hair 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.290
 which is in the frame of the face has 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:38.330
 to stay out so it stays 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.330
 nicest open and retired 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.710
 always looking towards the ground in 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.710
 diagonal 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.209
 as I am not a professional not with the 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.489
 iron and maybe to many of 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:01.370
 you happen if the curl is too 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:03.290
 above it remains strange especially when 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:08.980
 the area of the fringe is totally smooth 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:14.480
 it's okay, let's cojemos again the lock 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:17.000
 and we throw a little the top 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.370
 Well, we have only the part left 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.709
 from the bangs to the final 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.340
 this hair that I have here and a little more 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:27.120
 long 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:30.510
 it's worth the same thing we do it backwards 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.640
 so that it is separated from the face and 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.540
 nothing 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.269
 the bottom 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:38.920
 and not very marked but totally 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:43.480
 natural 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:45.970
 since being closer to the fringe is not 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.310
 I like that it is so laughs from above 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:52.540
 good and in your case if you have me 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:54.640
 like me in this area of a whirlpool and 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.430
 to try to make it as smooth as possible 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:04:01.090
 possible iron only what is the area 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:04.470
 in front it's worth below it did not arrive because it 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.470
 it is not totally straight 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.939
 always looking straight ahead 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:16.930
 and it took us to the end we give a little 

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:20.590
 of air down and the hair is left 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:22.480
 smarter the area here in here as I 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:26.290
 happens to me that I have eddies and that 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:28.870
 I insist a little more but it's above 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:33.010
 I do not finish ironing if I do not put 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:35.380
 a little visit and already while I'm leaving 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:38.460
 finishing making up since it gives 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:40.080
 the effect upwards and there are no 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.259
 looking 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:47.039
 as very electrified for those who 

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:49.590
 you want to make the loop in this case the 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:51.270
 more closed loop 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.940
 then you have to do in the same 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:56.430
 procedure the only thing that the iron 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:59.820
 you have to turn a little bit more and you should 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:02.930
 be diagonally like the other one has to 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.930
 be more down 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:12.180
 we make the totally complete turn 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.960
 slower than before so that it is still 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.420
 unclosed 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:20.070
 and straight down 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:20.070
 not so diagonally 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:27.900
 and the loop is still much more marked 

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:30.180
 Well, we've already finished if you want 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.969
 get a more natural effect I'll 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:35.969
 What I do in this case is to move the hair 

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:38.360
 a little down and then open the 

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:38.360
 fingers
