00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.470
 hello welcome we go again to a 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.630
 intervention that as I know it is a 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:24.949
 person in the lobby 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.949
 and be able to collect bullets 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.650
 or how is a pretty open map the 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.850
 channels and all that 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.850
 they will kill quite 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:45.550
 it could be an open map is that 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.559
 whether he is nervous 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.969
 not knowing where you can go can you 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:51.090
 kill right now through all the 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:51.090
 Map 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.670
 no one 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.229
 but 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.400
 because 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.400
 to paste media that h 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:48.510
 How fair and just do I think too much of 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.510
 Radar 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.920
 I should collect your bullets you know that 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.920
 they have been very risky 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:29.680
 is that because to see God to see how he has 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:32.349
 killed him 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.799
 if mom is going through is ignored hit 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:36.159
 marker 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:37.540
 no longer only the slaughterhouse is na 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:40.680
 that should give him gilmar that if not 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:43.819
 me to him that would hurt the killed 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:47.499
 because it's my truth 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.499
 not having made your fault I have that 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.050
 nothing happens there may still be a 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.160
 movement 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.160
 to take for ass 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.569
 today 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.709
 Well I'm pissed that's a good sign 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.709
 let it be like before 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.510
 good me with itching 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:26.280
 it's already happened because people get blood 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.300
 cold but I do not understand that you realize 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.300
 which is not as strong 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:34.270
 there is cold not that informant what 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.270
 I can play 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.730
 as I know that nothing happens if they kill me 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.090
 destroying here by the center of the map 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.090
 without fear 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:57.260
 s 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.260
 height 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.010
 we go 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:22.540
 the guys that cost the day 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.000
 to tie is also strong is the 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.000
 study 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:37.479
 yes 

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:41.800
 sniper call themselves good what the fuck 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:41.800
 people use this to one 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.490
 good though I think this was better 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.350
 that of more factors because apart from 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.100
 be all split ends full 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.100
 of emt of these 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.850
 it runs out of electronics every two 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:59.850
 three 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:06.840
 I say this, I do not dislike it because I do not 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:08.340
 there is only one person that SME who has 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.510
 electronic that sees the map and everything is 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:13.220
 enrique is nothing more 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:16.680
 I can also go unnoticed and 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:18.300
 take advantage of them there you have to tackle it 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.750
 what a bad habit to throw it without 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:20.750
 think about it 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.599
 sorry 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.900
 we go 

00:05:54.249 --> 00:05:57.359
 other gyms 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:09.520
 the shit attacks harry the truth 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:20.610
 it could have been 4 

00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:23.599
 with the harrier but I do not care about the water 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:23.599
 tritten all against all 

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:32.820
 sometimes with dark it's wearing 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:35.240
 slash 

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:38.010
 I do not like being the other sniper but 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:39.169
 you had to see an analgesic and good 

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:42.330
 may l 

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:44.960
 it is impossible to kill is like a place 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.960
 good 

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:54.050
 and every time it's going better because it's not going 

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:54.050
 going not bad
