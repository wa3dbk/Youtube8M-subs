on<00:00:39.890> the<00:00:40.010> screen<00:00:40.160> that<00:00:40.550> is<00:00:40.969> the<00:00:41.480> first<00:00:42.200> way<00:00:42.350> to

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
on the screen that is the first way to

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.680 
on the screen that is the first way to
launch<00:00:42.649> simple<00:00:42.980> tap<00:00:43.160> just<00:00:43.969> by<00:00:44.149> touching<00:00:44.420> that

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
red icon brings up the layer over top so

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.540 
red icon brings up the layer over top so
you<00:00:48.140> notice<00:00:48.469> there's<00:00:48.710> no<00:00:48.829> disruption<00:00:49.520> to

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
the other way to invoke simple tap is

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.380 
the other way to invoke simple tap is
with<00:00:54.649> a<00:00:54.680> two<00:00:54.800> finger<00:00:55.340> double<00:00:55.699> tap<00:00:55.820> of<00:00:56.239> your

screen so just by two finger tap like
that<00:00:59.359> brings<00:01:00.320> it<00:01:00.500> the<00:01:00.530> simple<00:01:00.739> tap<00:01:01.039> layer<00:01:01.309> and

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
that brings it the simple tap layer and

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:04.030 
that brings it the simple tap layer and
from<00:01:02.269> here<00:01:02.690> you<00:01:02.989> really<00:01:03.230> have<00:01:03.410> access<00:01:03.800> to

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
from here you really have access to

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.710 
from here you really have access to
things<00:01:04.250> that<00:01:04.400> on<00:01:04.610> this<00:01:04.730> tablet<00:01:05.000> for<00:01:05.300> example

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
things that on this tablet for example

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.440 
things that on this tablet for example
are<00:01:06.200> not<00:01:06.350> that<00:01:06.500> easy<00:01:06.710> without<00:01:06.950> the<00:01:07.250> keyboard

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
are not that easy without the keyboard

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.999 
are not that easy without the keyboard
without<00:01:08.450> access<00:01:08.900> to<00:01:08.930> the<00:01:09.110> keyboard<00:01:09.320> so<00:01:09.740> for

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:10.009 
without access to the keyboard so for

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:11.560 
without access to the keyboard so for
example<00:01:10.100> you<00:01:10.729> want<00:01:11.150> to<00:01:11.210> adjust<00:01:11.299> the

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
noticed within windows seven if you use

noticed within windows seven if you use
touch<00:02:03.049> systems<00:02:03.500> yet<00:02:03.740> some<00:02:04.670> things<00:02:04.880> are<00:02:05.030> a

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
touch systems yet some things are a

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.330 
touch systems yet some things are a
little<00:02:05.240> bit<00:02:05.479> less<00:02:05.869> easy<00:02:06.350> than<00:02:06.710> then<00:02:07.070> you<00:02:07.159> might

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
little bit less easy than then you might

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.740 
little bit less easy than then you might
like<00:02:07.549> for<00:02:07.909> example<00:02:08.030> if<00:02:08.330> you<00:02:08.390> just<00:02:08.539> want<00:02:08.690> to

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
like for example if you just want to

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.180 
like for example if you just want to
walk<00:02:08.899> the<00:02:09.110> system<00:02:09.440> and<00:02:09.560> again<00:02:09.770> we<00:02:09.920> don't<00:02:10.009> have

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
walk the system and again we don't have

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.090 
walk the system and again we don't have
access<00:02:10.369> to<00:02:10.640> the<00:02:10.729> keyboard<00:02:10.910> to<00:02:11.150> use<00:02:11.420> Windows<00:02:11.780> L

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
access to the keyboard to use Windows L

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.200 
access to the keyboard to use Windows L
you<00:02:13.100> got<00:02:13.220> to<00:02:13.310> touch<00:02:13.460> that<00:02:13.610> little<00:02:13.820> arrow<00:02:14.000> right

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
you got to touch that little arrow right

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.240 
you got to touch that little arrow right
there<00:02:14.450> and<00:02:14.600> use<00:02:14.720> lock<00:02:14.960> and<00:02:15.170> if<00:02:15.230> you<00:02:15.350> miss<00:02:15.530> you

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
there and use lock and if you miss you

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.790 
there and use lock and if you miss you
hit<00:02:16.370> shut

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
hit shut

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.410 
hit shut
so<00:02:17.190> that's<00:02:17.370> one<00:02:17.520> of<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:17.670> things<00:02:17.730> we<00:02:18.000> targeted

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
so that's one of the things we targeted

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.140 
so that's one of the things we targeted
with<00:02:18.570> simple<00:02:19.200> tab<00:02:19.380> give<00:02:20.370> you<00:02:20.490> a<00:02:20.520> nice<00:02:20.670> ability

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
with simple tab give you a nice ability

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.770 
with simple tab give you a nice ability
to<00:02:21.360> just<00:02:21.720> tap<00:02:21.930> that<00:02:22.200> and<00:02:22.440> lock<00:02:22.950> your<00:02:23.160> computer

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
to just tap that and lock your computer

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.570 
to just tap that and lock your computer
and<00:02:24.780> be<00:02:25.410> able<00:02:25.500> to<00:02:25.650> walk<00:02:25.830> all<00:02:26.010> right<00:02:26.130> away<00:02:26.370> and

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
and be able to walk all right away and

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.010 
and be able to walk all right away and
not<00:02:26.640> have<00:02:26.880> to<00:02:26.970> convert<00:02:27.240> back<00:02:27.420> to<00:02:27.450> the<00:02:27.630> keyboard

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
not have to convert back to the keyboard

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.310 
not have to convert back to the keyboard
mode<00:02:28.230> or<00:02:28.860> go<00:02:29.040> digging<00:02:29.670> down<00:02:29.700> into<00:02:29.820> Windows<00:02:30.360> to

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
mode or go digging down into Windows to

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.060 
mode or go digging down into Windows to
use<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:31.890> lock<00:02:32.070> function<00:02:32.340> on<00:02:32.700> on<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.300> thinkpad

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
use the lock function on on the thinkpad

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.950 
use the lock function on on the thinkpad
so<00:02:35.070> we<00:02:35.160> think<00:02:35.280> it<00:02:35.460> will<00:02:35.550> make<00:02:35.670> touch<00:02:36.570> just<00:02:36.900> a

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
so we think it will make touch just a

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.630 
so we think it will make touch just a
very<00:02:37.140> natural<00:02:37.350> interactive<00:02:38.040> way<00:02:38.190> stay<00:02:38.580> in

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
very natural interactive way stay in

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.920 
very natural interactive way stay in
tablet<00:02:39.060> mode<00:02:39.090> which<00:02:39.450> is<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.690> reason<00:02:39.810> you

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930
