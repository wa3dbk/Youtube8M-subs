00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 hello everyone my name is Michael and me 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:07.529
 constantly asks to make a movie while I 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.050
 sky sbu while there is 1 of 6 but unfortunately 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.059
 I play this game very rarely for a year 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.820
 what I have it and simulated hours 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.830
 40 kopecks no more and honestly 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.619
 I don't even know what to do with it 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.869
 again ridiculous cut boring and skill 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.930
 me there is insufficient time to 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.849
 pull it no but one idea is me 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.769
 head still came why not 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.710
 talk about how it all began 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.850
 because I witnessed the appearance 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.710
 counter-strike watched as 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.809
 developed game like it grew 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.700
 the popularity involved various 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.500
 tournaments so sit down 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.510
 more comfortable now Uncle Misha will 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.510
 tell how everything was really 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.410
 I present to your attention the clan do is a 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.780
 finite his group vk 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.970
 want to find a partner to join the clan 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.680
 or just read the latest news about 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.530
 favorite game then you here 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.600
 join the link in the description of those who 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.820
 following me at least from the middle 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.100
 last year should remember the movie under 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.320
 called nostalgia for half-life there i'm 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.630
 told us how we were in the past 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.210
 this beautiful multiplayer game 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.310
 went to clubs and so on and there I 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.649
 casually mentioned pro k with one 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:33.050
 fine day we came after school 

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:35.690
 or even instead of school to the club as well 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:38.179
 usually play chopped give all 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.130
 played some new game that is 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:42.560
 unlike various blasters 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.740
 vacuum cleaners that were there in half-life and 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.240
 this game was realistic that is there 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.679
 there were sniper rifles 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.990
 Kalashnikov m16 we fucked I can of course 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:56.270
 wrong but in my opinion the first version 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.310
 the counter who appeared to our club there 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.500
 there was only one card i mean i am straight 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.869
 I clearly remember that everyone played on one 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.550
 the map there needed to take hostages 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:07.640
 if you played for the mines you must first 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:10.160
 was to pass a photo to someone a long corridor 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.800
 and open the platform for which something 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.870
 like a castle type castle and there were 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.060
 terrorist way kill me don't remember the name 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.890
 this card in my opinion it has not been preserved and 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.010
 and now there is no one among the most popular 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.810
 cards so far with but in my opinion everything was so we 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.140
 were really amazed by this game in 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:29.090
 particular and realistic after all 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.910
 absolutely all popular shooters on that 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.610
 moment were fantastic setting it 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.620
 half-life quake anril travel 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.410
 and so on after some time after 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:41.900
 counter-strike success i remember exactly 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.959
 a whole bunch of different mods appeared 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.970
 such as dfd fit opposition force 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.310
 but I was most pleased with this mod 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.989
 like a fair thumbs up if you remember 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.300
 This mod I am sure among my subscribers 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.970
 there are such people it was something like 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.159
 super hardcore control versions ie 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:59.569
 there were much more weapons there if 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:02.239
 you will give you 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:04.800
 bleeding you should have been bandaged 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:07.020
 and there they could break your legs 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.000
 In the club at that time, not a few people played 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.800
 and I had to abandon her not to play 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.230
 live girl right so we 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.570
 focused on country music came with 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.300
 friends every day the club was played by 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:20.040
 two to three hours windows spend time 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.770
 developed out all new and new 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.620
 version and as I remember my favorite 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:29.280
 it was not everyone's favorite 1.6 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:31.230
 and the previous 1.5 I especially liked to play 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.290
 on the map from you are bad 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:36.660
 guys how did I drag just endured 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.790
 enemies with 2 bullet especially adored i 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.890
 play cops simochka with a silencer 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.430
 run by the way speaking even though i am now 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.650
 love 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.650
 gaming sniping but when i played cs 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.540
 never ran with an elephant 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.860
 I know why, but I liked it with 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.350
 automatic weapons 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.560
 she even a little despised snayperok 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:57.420
 type suckers 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.880
 like real cool players run 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.190
 Seeds once I saw that I was about 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.890
 I understand why many now burn 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.020
 a bunch of that battle from snipers and since 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.630
 I also spoke played her very cool as well 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:12.030
 my friends and the time has come when it came 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.130
 time to realize us skill in something 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.980
 more serious and we set up a team 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.840
 the truth did not last long in the first 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.090
 in the same tournament, we won in my third 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.250
 place and after that somehow the team 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.680
 fell apart but I continued to play and 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:28.020
 then I will let the more serious guys 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.690
 in the end we won the championship twice 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:33.330
 cities 5 by 5 and once we won with 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.460
 mate championship two by two repent 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:38.040
 but unfortunately or fortunately on my 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:40.680
 eSports career has not progressed 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:43.440
 then I was finishing school I needed 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.270
 think about something more serious than a game 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.310
 in counter-strike plus we became 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.169
 much less practice games in the end 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.210
 because there is another cool 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:51.900
 the game was called warcraft frozen 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.000
 throne 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.070
 that is, if we used to come to the club 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.890
 and played exclusively in the stroller 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:02.040
 now we chose to play the elevator or in 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:04.250
 this is literally a year later and at all beginning 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.870
 ends with computer clubs 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:09.690
 2004 I had my first 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.169
 com all of our favorite clubs closed 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.360
 since it became unprofitable 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:15.159
 already do this and the internet is 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.139
 the moment was very weak that is 

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:20.319
 I personally play on the network at the end was 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:22.270
 very hard and too expensive therefore i 

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:24.699
 At the time I abandoned this game 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.620
 only played very rarely this with bots 

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:28.689
 As for counter strike source, I 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.569
 I remember exactly that she appeared for the first time 

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:33.669
 even when was flying clubs and even remember 

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:35.949
 that we will play her for a while 

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:38.919
 think well, like nothing then 

00:05:35.949 --> 00:05:42.039
 but again returned so in one and 5.16 and 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:45.430
 here is a rather long period in 2012 

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:48.129
 year I met and became interested in this YouTube 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:49.930
 I decided to create a gaming channel in my 

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:51.849
 just that moment appeared counter 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:53.830
 strike global offensive than gameplay you 

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:56.680
 see on your screen and that's how it is now 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:58.779
 I remember everything scolded her overwhelming 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.060
 most reviewers shouted it 

00:05:58.779 --> 00:06:03.759
 practically no different from to with 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.569
 surs that the shooting has become more random 

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:06.969
 wretched 

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:09.669
 that is, almost everyone scolded this game 

00:06:06.969 --> 00:06:11.409
 that's how I remember but now after three 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:14.139
 years after the release you look 

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:14.620
 almost everyone plays facebook even those 

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:17.229
 Who 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:19.810
 fanatel from 1 and 6 and in no case 

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:22.000
 I wanted to move to ks go back and decided 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:23.529
 already after the appearance of all these cases and 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.750
 gun colorings 

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:26.649
 the game attracted a huge amount 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:29.080
 diverse 

00:06:26.649 --> 00:06:31.210
 players mostly junior course 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:33.759
 ages and now is on the second 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:34.120
 place on the popularity of the incentive after dota 

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:35.979
 2 

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:38.409
 By the way, about a dotka, too 

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:40.659
 stories to tell for was witness 

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:42.370
 the appearance of the first dota since i was 

00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:44.289
 fan of warcraft frozen throne 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:46.569
 but we'll talk about it another time and 

00:06:44.289 --> 00:06:48.550
 Here I go periodically vks head and 

00:06:46.569 --> 00:06:51.789
 just missing those old days 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:53.020
 when we played clubs to reed not 

00:06:51.789 --> 00:06:55.300
 there were no cheats 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.740
 no one could offend you say that 

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:59.319
 there your mother stuck 

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:01.389
 for sitting opposite you literal you 

00:06:59.319 --> 00:07:03.370
 could become and break his mouse in the head 

00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:06.279
 Now the end of all this is not have to 

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:07.899
 Sorry but enough senile fermentation 

00:07:06.279 --> 00:07:10.509
 I hope you enjoyed my story 

00:07:07.899 --> 00:07:11.710
 I hope you were interested in it for me 

00:07:10.509 --> 00:07:14.189
