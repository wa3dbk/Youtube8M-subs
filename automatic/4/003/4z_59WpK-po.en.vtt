 simple and here you have it, it opens 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.950
 the weird open to me 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.990
 automatically since I have it put 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.020
 well then then after this 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:54.440
 we just have to execute it 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:56.650
 as you see gamers mini craft cetera what 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:00.400

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:04.960
 all right and execute let's go out 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:06.670
 and we see that they execute us and tell us 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.530
 this distraction found we have 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.440
 found an act of science is 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.390
 need to update to be able to 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.700
 connect to that record you want to update 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.650
 at the first start it is necessary to 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.530
 we say yes and you can update 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.330

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:06.420
 they want me I do not know why 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:12.080
 kicks 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:12.080
 I have a silly rhythm today 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.230
 Well here we see finished updating 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.710
 and we have the launcher and we can walk 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.840
 in good yes so you know it then 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:31.200
 these links up here lead to 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:34.980
 the different facebook twitter and youtube 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.900
 of gamers is worth to subscribe to 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.570
 your channel follow us on twitter facebook 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.990
 out there they put a lot of information 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:45.290
 about games news and so on and then 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:47.760
 also for access to have an access 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.980
 directly to the minecraft community 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.990
 as such if we click on these letters 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.140
 we see that it takes us to the forum directly 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:57.180
 you see you can not web is simply the 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.370
 curiosity of the very busy pitcher as 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:02.310
 thanks to sergi as he puts it here and dvd 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:05.070
 recorder and good now to see there is a 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.560
 small bug that you have is not a let's say 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:09.180
 because failure is not good is still a 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.160
 inconvenience that they have at the beginning is 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.780
 that we select the first of them 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.220
 selected and game mods is worth and 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.230
 we select our radio for example 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.440
 started with five gigs that's a lot 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:21.600
 but but you can select 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.820
 depending on what you have if 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.780
 example has 2 gb of ram so you can 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.360
 put me 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:29.010
 2500 the program itself seems to me that 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.300
 the limited lets us start if not 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.560
 you have enough but good 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:36.360
 we put the account 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.360
 we put our password 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:42.389
 and now where does what I say the 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.249
 first time we started the launcher 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:46.289
 will give us this ruling but nobody 

00:04:44.249 --> 00:04:48.930
 worry because it's normal is worth the 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:51.590
 launcher creates us a direct access to the 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:54.419
 work here in a thousand open houses and nothing 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.789
 we created this direct access okay let's go 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:58.110
 to run from here again and now 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:00.870
 it will not fail 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:03.659
 now it will enter now let's enter 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:06.090
 the version with mods is valid and we enter the 

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:06.930
 version with mods here tells us news the 

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:09.419
 tea worth 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.740
 here you have to tell him that it's not worth not 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:14.349
 lose the mods 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.780
 very important please the second time 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:19.979
 that asks us to update minecraft does not 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.979
 we say that it is not worth 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.110
 well it would be multiplayer obviously if 

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:25.910
 we try to enter this server we do not 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:28.110
 will let us go to let this 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:31.830
 for you to see 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:34.650
 here we are connected be with 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:36.780
 here with willy unexpectedly ask 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:40.140
 disconnect anything else they come pointed sixth 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:44.430
 and so you can see that simply with a 

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:45.840
 click ok and click on the no version 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:49.430
 you have to change nothing else simply the 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:49.430
 normal version enter 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:56.099
 we tell him that this is this about you 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:58.349
 tell who is to be updated 

00:05:56.099 --> 00:06:01.110
 I'm going to remove it because update the 

00:05:58.349 --> 00:06:03.360
 client right now to the 125 that I do not 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:05.220
 it had realized then that 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.139
 ignore it but good for me to see 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:09.840
 with one click you enter the other server 

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:11.669
 no problem everything works right 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:16.199
 I am here I do not know where I am but 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:20.880
 but I am and well, this has been 

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:25.740
 I hope everything works for the tutorial and 

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:27.540
 a brief explanation to all the people the 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:31.730
 number of people who are asking me 

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:31.730
 please pass them on my server 

00:06:32.249 --> 00:06:36.959
 my servers I can not pass it on to anyone 

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:40.169
 because my server is configured to 

00:06:36.959 --> 00:06:42.989
 by and for the gamers community and for 

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:44.729
 so it 's from that community I 'm 

00:06:42.989 --> 00:06:46.469
 private is not that we are private 

00:06:44.729 --> 00:06:48.089
 we put it in the public but not what 

00:06:46.469 --> 00:06:48.859
 I can pass, I can not give you the 

00:06:48.089 --> 00:06:52.409
 server 

00:06:48.859 --> 00:06:54.479
 I'm trying to prepare something for you all 

00:06:52.409 --> 00:06:56.399
 but you have to have a little bit of 

00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:58.799
 patience ok I'll prepare a mini 

00:06:56.399 --> 00:07:01.349
 tutorial how do I download the base 

00:06:58.799 --> 00:07:02.849
 how I started my server and from 

00:07:01.349 --> 00:07:04.409
 there you go customizing yours 

00:07:02.849 --> 00:07:07.169
 until you do not work to your 

00:07:04.409 --> 00:07:10.169
 taste and good 

00:07:07.169 --> 00:07:13.590
 Well, nothing more from here from the 

00:07:10.169 --> 00:07:17.580
 city of gamers skyscrapers a 

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:20.960
 kripper and nothing here I let you come up 

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:20.960
 the next goodbye
