sticks<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:51.930> his<00:01:52.020> hand<00:01:53.509> definitely<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.780> recon

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200

armor so blue band

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:09.600 
armor so blue band
so<00:02:03.229> this<00:02:04.149> blue<00:02:05.149> team<00:02:05.719> I<00:02:05.990> think<00:02:06.380> um<00:02:07.209> the

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
so this blue team I think um the

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.320 
so this blue team I think um the
grifball<00:02:10.610> it's<00:02:10.970> very<00:02:11.900> simple<00:02:12.319> and<00:02:13.239> there's<00:02:14.239> a

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
grifball it's very simple and there's a

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:22.500 
grifball it's very simple and there's a
little<00:02:14.959> hole<00:02:15.430> um<00:02:16.930> and<00:02:18.640> right<00:02:19.640> there<00:02:19.910> is<00:02:20.090> the

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.390 

peg<00:02:23.510> deployed<00:02:23.900> on<00:02:24.110> which<00:02:24.709> is<00:02:24.890> not<00:02:25.040> removable

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
peg deployed on which is not removable

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:31.289 
peg deployed on which is not removable
from<00:02:26.300> the<00:02:26.390> character<00:02:26.750> oh<00:02:27.069> and<00:02:28.069> the<00:02:29.440> wrists

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
from the character oh and the wrists

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:41.250 
from the character oh and the wrists
move<00:02:35.560> yeah<00:02:36.610> you<00:02:37.610> know<00:02:37.730> what<00:02:37.880> I<00:02:37.940> mean<00:02:37.970> and<00:02:39.010> the

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
move yeah you know what I mean and the

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:52.120 
move yeah you know what I mean and the
curve<00:02:42.260> hammer

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:03:05.190 

um<00:02:52.450> it<00:02:53.450> attaches<00:02:53.810> to<00:02:54.050> his<00:02:54.290> back<00:02:55.360> by<00:02:56.360> their<00:03:02.440> peg

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
um it attaches to his back by their peg

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.950 
um it attaches to his back by their peg
energy<00:03:06.200> so<00:03:06.350> it<00:03:06.380> comes<00:03:06.650> with<00:03:06.830> the<00:03:06.860> peg<00:03:07.160> and<00:03:07.960> a

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:08.960 
energy so it comes with the peg and a

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.250 
energy so it comes with the peg and a
rubber<00:03:09.260> band<00:03:09.560> to<00:03:10.010> keep<00:03:10.190> it<00:03:10.310> on<00:03:10.430> I<00:03:10.750> do<00:03:11.750> not<00:03:12.050> want

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
rubber band to keep it on I do not want

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.350 
rubber band to keep it on I do not want
to<00:03:12.440> take<00:03:12.650> it<00:03:12.680> off<00:03:12.920> because<00:03:13.400> I<00:03:13.850> like<00:03:14.030> it<00:03:14.180> there

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
to take it off because I like it there

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.750 
to take it off because I like it there
and<00:03:14.590> it'd<00:03:15.590> be<00:03:15.770> pointless<00:03:15.950> to<00:03:16.220> put<00:03:16.490> it<00:03:16.580> on

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
and it'd be pointless to put it on

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.390 
and it'd be pointless to put it on
because<00:03:17.180> you<00:03:17.510> can't<00:03:17.780> really<00:03:18.170> hold<00:03:18.320> that<00:03:18.530> good

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
because you can't really hold that good

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:31.360 
because you can't really hold that good
um<00:03:22.690> go<00:03:23.690> a<00:03:23.720> nice<00:03:23.930> figure<00:03:24.320> uh<00:03:26.200> I<00:03:27.850> got<00:03:28.850> lucky<00:03:30.370> cuz
