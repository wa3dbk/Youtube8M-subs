your device all the way to the nearest

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.150 
your device all the way to the nearest
one<00:01:00.090> um<00:01:00.480> step<00:01:00.989> two<00:01:01.230> you<00:01:01.620> cannot<00:01:01.920> have

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
one um step two you cannot have

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.889 
one um step two you cannot have
assistive<00:01:02.579> touch<00:01:02.789> actually<00:01:03.420> miss<00:01:03.719> three

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
assistive touch actually miss three

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.289 
assistive touch actually miss three
steps<00:01:04.110> in<00:01:04.290> step<00:01:04.409> three<00:01:04.830> it<00:01:05.580> helps<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:06.119> have<00:01:06.240> a

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
steps in step three it helps to have a

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.320 
steps in step three it helps to have a
folder<00:01:06.780> so<00:01:07.680> basically<00:01:07.979> I<00:01:08.070> think<00:01:08.909> that<00:01:09.119> is

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
folder so basically I think that is

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.450 
folder so basically I think that is
great<00:01:09.689> about<00:01:09.840> this<00:01:10.110> is<00:01:10.320> that<00:01:10.409> it<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:10.619> universal

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
great about this is that it is universal

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.609 
great about this is that it is universal
you<00:01:11.729> can<00:01:11.880> have<00:01:12.000> an<00:01:12.119> Android<00:01:12.510> or<00:01:12.720> iOS<00:01:12.900> it<00:01:13.409> works

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
you can have an Android or iOS it works

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.560 
you can have an Android or iOS it works

hundred<00:01:26.490> like<00:01:27.270> let's<00:01:27.450> say<00:01:27.540> you<00:01:27.659> have<00:01:27.780> two

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
hundred like let's say you have two

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.200 
hundred like let's say you have two
hundred<00:01:28.110> thousand<00:01:28.439> coins<00:01:28.530> right<00:01:28.680> now<00:01:28.860> um<00:01:29.729> I

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
hundred thousand coins right now um I

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.880 
hundred thousand coins right now um I
would<00:01:30.570> spend<00:01:30.780> fifty<00:01:31.110> thousand<00:01:31.470> coins<00:01:31.590> because

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
would spend fifty thousand coins because

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.679 
would spend fifty thousand coins because
you're<00:01:32.400> always<00:01:32.610> gonna<00:01:32.850> go<00:01:33.030> back<00:01:33.150> down<00:01:33.299> to<00:01:33.329> zero

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
you're always gonna go back down to zero

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.330 
you're always gonna go back down to zero
so<00:01:33.960> can't<00:01:34.170> like<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.380> million<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:35.310> have

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
so can't like a million you have

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.160 
so can't like a million you have
anywhere<00:01:35.729> more<00:01:35.970> than<00:01:36.210> like<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.689> pack<00:01:36.930> that

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
anywhere more than like the pack that
