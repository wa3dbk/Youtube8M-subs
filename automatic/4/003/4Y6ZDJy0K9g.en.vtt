00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
so kind of interesting twist i mean i

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.630 
so kind of interesting twist i mean i
remember<00:01:09.540> at<00:01:09.689> some<00:01:09.869> point<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:11.310> kobes

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
remember at some point the the kobes

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.160 
remember at some point the the kobes
would<00:01:12.060> come<00:01:12.210> out<00:01:12.330> with<00:01:12.479> some<00:01:12.600> dope<00:01:12.750> colorways

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
would come out with some dope colorways

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.140 
would come out with some dope colorways
and<00:01:13.320> they'd<00:01:13.680> sell<00:01:13.950> out<00:01:14.070> instantly<00:01:14.460> but<00:01:14.640> seems

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
and they'd sell out instantly but seems

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.390 
and they'd sell out instantly but seems
like<00:01:15.240> towards<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.689> end<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.140> well<00:01:16.979> i<00:01:17.009> guess

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
like towards the end of the well i guess

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.670 
like towards the end of the well i guess
now<00:01:17.610> towards<00:01:18.119> now<00:01:18.600> like<00:01:18.900> in<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.140> last<00:01:19.320> three

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
now towards now like in the last three

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.859 
now towards now like in the last three
months<00:01:19.710> or<00:01:20.009> so<00:01:20.130> four<00:01:20.549> months<00:01:20.689> they<00:01:21.689> just

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
months or so four months they just

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.450 
months or so four months they just
haven't<00:01:22.049> been<00:01:22.140> selling<00:01:22.470> out<00:01:22.560> so<00:01:22.799> but<00:01:23.189> this<00:01:23.280> is

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
haven't been selling out so but this is

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.649 
haven't been selling out so but this is
another<00:01:23.640> one<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:23.850> was<00:01:24.090> like<00:01:24.119> crazy<00:01:24.270> because

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
another one that was like crazy because

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.429 
another one that was like crazy because
it<00:01:24.900> costs<00:01:25.049> so<00:01:25.259> much<00:01:25.320> to<00:01:26.299> to<00:01:27.299> buy<00:01:27.900> like<00:01:28.229> two

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
it costs so much to to buy like two

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.109 
it costs so much to to buy like two
hundred<00:01:28.500> dollars<00:01:28.890> is<00:01:29.040> just<00:01:29.430> ridiculous<00:01:29.939> for

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
hundred dollars is just ridiculous for

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.910 
hundred dollars is just ridiculous for
those<00:01:30.240> so<00:01:30.450> i<00:01:30.630> think<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:31.290> was<00:01:31.380> two<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:31.619> i<00:01:31.710> can't

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530

laces<00:02:17.920> on<00:02:18.040> these<00:02:18.160> guys<00:02:18.340> but<00:02:18.760> I<00:02:18.790> kind<00:02:19.000> of

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
laces on these guys but I kind of

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.979 
laces on these guys but I kind of
thought<00:02:19.209> about<00:02:19.420> it<00:02:19.540> I<00:02:19.599> was<00:02:19.690> like<00:02:19.959> I

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
thought about it I was like I

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:21.420 
thought about it I was like I
should<00:02:20.230> take<00:02:20.319> the<00:02:20.500> laces<00:02:20.650> off<00:02:20.950> of<00:02:21.069> these<00:02:21.160> ones

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
should take the laces off of these ones

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.270 
should take the laces off of these ones
and<00:02:21.660> put<00:02:22.660> them<00:02:22.720> on<00:02:22.870> these<00:02:23.739> guys<00:02:23.980> so<00:02:24.129> that's

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
and put them on these guys so that's

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.710 
and put them on these guys so that's
probably<00:02:24.430> I'm<00:02:24.610> gonna<00:02:24.760> end<00:02:24.849> up<00:02:24.879> doing<00:02:25.180> just

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720
