put it up against the wall mattress side

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.160 
put it up against the wall mattress side
first<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:48.350> it<00:00:49.350> could<00:00:49.620> be<00:00:50.360> shortened<00:00:51.360> as<00:00:51.899> far

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
first and it could be shortened as far

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.250 
first and it could be shortened as far
as<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.410> depth<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.829> little<00:00:52.860> bit<00:00:53.390> by<00:00:54.390> taking<00:00:54.930> off

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
as the depth a little bit by taking off

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.479 
as the depth a little bit by taking off
that<00:00:55.559> footboard<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:57.109> I<00:00:58.109> could<00:00:58.980> gain<00:00:59.160> about

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
that footboard and I could gain about

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.740 
that footboard and I could gain about
three<00:00:59.879> inches<00:01:00.379> as<00:01:01.379> you<00:01:01.590> can<00:01:01.770> see<00:01:02.510> about<00:01:03.510> two

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
three inches as you can see about two

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.359 
three inches as you can see about two
and<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:03.930> half<00:01:03.989> inches<00:01:04.439> over<00:01:04.769> there<00:01:04.949> that<00:01:05.189> could

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
and a half inches over there that could

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.760 
and a half inches over there that could
be<00:01:05.400> gained<00:01:05.810> so<00:01:06.810> it<00:01:06.990> could<00:01:07.110> be<00:01:07.290> slightly

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
be gained so it could be slightly

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.530 
be gained so it could be slightly
smaller<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:10.100> next<00:01:11.100> I'm<00:01:11.220> just<00:01:11.280> going<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.700> lower
