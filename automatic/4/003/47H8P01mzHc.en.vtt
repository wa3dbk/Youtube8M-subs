like<00:03:14.620> a<00:03:14.739> snap<00:03:15.070> sound<00:03:15.430> and<00:03:15.790> then<00:03:16.209> you<00:03:16.329> slide

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
like a snap sound and then you slide

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.080 
like a snap sound and then you slide
them<00:03:17.049> onto<00:03:17.530> the<00:03:17.980> sectioned<00:03:18.370> hair<00:03:18.579> and<00:03:18.790> close

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
them onto the sectioned hair and close

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.180 
them onto the sectioned hair and close
the<00:03:19.329> clip<00:03:19.570> and<00:03:19.780> then<00:03:20.769> it<00:03:20.890> should<00:03:21.040> look

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
the clip and then it should look

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:22.800 
the clip and then it should look
something<00:03:21.250> like<00:03:21.640> this<00:03:21.970> it's<00:03:22.750> very

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
something like this it's very

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.420 
something like this it's very
straightforward<00:03:23.350> I<00:03:25.799> actually<00:03:26.799> like<00:03:27.130> to<00:03:27.160> give

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
straightforward I actually like to give

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:28.770 
straightforward I actually like to give
the<00:03:27.579> weft<00:03:27.730> a<00:03:27.850> little<00:03:28.060> tug<00:03:28.269> just<00:03:28.480> to<00:03:28.600> make<00:03:28.750> sure

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
the weft a little tug just to make sure

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.610 
the weft a little tug just to make sure
it's<00:03:29.079> all<00:03:29.200> secure<00:03:30.959> then<00:03:31.959> it<00:03:32.079> is<00:03:32.170> just<00:03:32.200> a<00:03:32.440> case

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
it's all secure then it is just a case

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.199 
it's all secure then it is just a case
of<00:03:32.650> repeating<00:03:33.190> these<00:03:33.280> steps<00:03:33.340> until<00:03:33.850> your<00:03:34.060> hair

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
of repeating these steps until your hair

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:36.449 
of repeating these steps until your hair
is<00:03:34.329> complete<00:03:34.690> all<00:03:35.530> you<00:03:35.769> have<00:03:35.920> to<00:03:36.040> do<00:03:36.130> is<00:03:36.250> place

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
is complete all you have to do is place

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.640 
is complete all you have to do is place
the<00:03:36.640> clips<00:03:36.880> where<00:03:37.090> they<00:03:37.209> fit<00:03:37.450> best<00:03:37.750> and<00:03:38.170> the

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
the clips where they fit best and the

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:42.509 
the clips where they fit best and the
weft<00:03:40.350> the<00:03:41.350> wefts<00:03:41.560> with<00:03:41.890> the<00:03:41.980> most<00:03:42.220> clips

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
weft the wefts with the most clips

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:44.580 
weft the wefts with the most clips
should<00:03:42.670> go<00:03:42.880> in<00:03:43.150> a<00:03:43.600> central<00:03:44.079> section<00:03:44.380> of<00:03:44.440> your

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.289 
should go in a central section of your
head<00:03:44.799> obviously<00:03:44.950> if<00:03:45.340> that<00:03:45.370> makes<00:03:45.670> sense<00:03:45.760> I

head obviously if that makes sense I

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:48.270 
head obviously if that makes sense I
usually<00:03:46.989> place<00:03:47.200> three<00:03:47.590> widths<00:03:47.920> at<00:03:48.040> the<00:03:48.100> back

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
usually place three widths at the back

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.220 
usually place three widths at the back
and<00:03:48.549> the<00:03:48.670> rest<00:03:48.880> I<00:03:49.030> sort<00:03:49.239> of<00:03:49.299> have<00:03:49.510> curving

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
and the rest I sort of have curving

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.050 
and the rest I sort of have curving
around<00:03:50.320> the<00:03:50.739> side<00:03:50.920> of<00:03:50.950> my<00:03:51.190> head<00:03:51.370> with<00:03:51.730> my<00:03:51.880> hair

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.789 
to the front and that way the extensions
will<00:03:54.880> blend<00:03:55.120> perfectly<00:03:55.480> with<00:03:56.049> my<00:03:56.440> natural

texture in here so I want to sort of

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.110 
texture in here so I want to sort of
replicate<00:04:30.350> it<00:04:30.710> a<00:04:30.770> bit<00:04:30.890> on<00:04:30.980> this<00:04:31.130> part<00:04:31.400> so<00:04:31.670> what

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
and glide quite difficult to do it 24

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.140 
and glide quite difficult to do it 24
inch<00:04:45.140> sessions<00:04:45.590> but<00:04:46.010> just<00:04:46.220> like<00:04:46.460> from<00:04:46.820> the<00:04:46.940> end

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:47.150 
inch sessions but just like from the end

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:49.510 
inch sessions but just like from the end
of<00:04:47.390> my<00:04:47.540> fringe<00:04:47.840> which<00:04:48.230> is<00:04:48.350> around<00:04:48.530> here<00:04:48.770> you

of my fringe which is around here you

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.330 
of my fringe which is around here you
can<00:04:49.670> see<00:04:49.820> this<00:04:50.000> method<00:04:50.990> chair<00:04:51.320> glides<00:04:52.160> down

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
can see this method chair glides down

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.970 
can see this method chair glides down
there<00:04:52.850> making<00:04:53.240> gentle<00:04:53.750> chops<00:04:54.050> until<00:04:54.860> I'm

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:54.980 
there making gentle chops until I'm

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:00.190 
there making gentle chops until I'm
happy<00:04:55.160> with<00:04:55.340> it<00:04:55.550> so<00:04:56.380> back<00:04:57.380> here<00:04:58.600> just<00:04:59.600> gliding

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.200 
happy with it so back here just gliding

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:09.780 
happy with it so back here just gliding
down<00:05:01.600> making<00:05:02.600> gentle<00:05:06.160> layers<00:05:07.160> like<00:05:07.670> that

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:09.790 
down making gentle layers like that

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.220 
down making gentle layers like that
might<00:05:10.790> take<00:05:10.970> a<00:05:11.000> few<00:05:11.240> guys<00:05:11.390> to<00:05:11.420> get<00:05:11.720> it<00:05:11.810> perfect

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:12.230 
might take a few guys to get it perfect

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:15.820 
might take a few guys to get it perfect
but<00:05:12.350> once<00:05:12.560> it<00:05:12.710> is<00:05:13.120> absolutely<00:05:14.120> fine<00:05:14.620> be<00:05:15.620> much

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 
but once it is absolutely fine be much

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.760 
but once it is absolutely fine be much
