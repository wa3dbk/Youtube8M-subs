00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:06.040
 Y 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:08.830
 for the girls see today I'm going to 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:11.950
 share my homemade mask with the 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:16.299
 that I defined my curls as they can 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:17.770
 see are super super defined and about 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.680
 we are all hydrated as you can see 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:23.169
 in that it does not look parched anywhere 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:26.439
 nor does he have any frizz in catching much 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:30.530
 very much but because they are good 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:32.600
 defined others the hair shrinks more 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.820
 The only thing that I am going to recommend is that 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:38.390
 good to apply the first time your 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:41.330
 hair when you have it developed 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.640
 share small mentions and apply 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.710
 the cream abundantly from above 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.150
 from the trunk to the tips and what 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.970
 I will distribute at the tips so that 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.890
 Do not have Felix when it dries when 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.570
 is finished putting the product is not 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.309
 go crazy and you can avoid the 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.680
 oils why I will not feel that the dog 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:00.050
 you need hydration but do not wait 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.010
 until everything dries up and I have almost 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.860
 all day 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.700
 like the hours mask that was 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.890
 a little fenced and dry 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.229
 wait until the end and then if you see 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:16.220
 that they lack hydration they put 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:18.560
 oil but I think you can see it 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.310
 all the times that I stay well 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.310
 hydrous 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.230
 two 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.440
 because the mask has many 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:29.420
 oils 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.190
 what are you going to see next I think 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.420
 that I appreciate commented with the oil them 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.520
 I would advise that these are a little 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.560
 less so that the hair did not stay very 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.810
 fatty but if they do not have excessively 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.090
 dry, then put the amounts such 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:45.280
 which are in the video 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.280
 well this is all 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.610
 but what I like to be told 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.539
 the girl the ingredients that we're going to 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.090
 use are very simple here we have 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:09.849
 a mixture of oils this is oil 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.099
 olive argan oil a-7 rosemary oil 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:13.900
 of coconut and sweet almond oil 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:16.480
 you can use those who want 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.880
 as you can see is a good amount of 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.220
 oil 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.140
 and I've also added two tablespoons of 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.510
 honey and about two tablespoons of 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:28.010
 shea butter that I'm going to put on 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.010
 a bain-marie to melt 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.409
 I'm going to add here 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:37.470
 more or less a spoonful a plug 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:39.600
 vegetable glycerin 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.950
 is going to help you control frizz but 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.730
 neither should you abuse because you can not 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.730
 get to dry your hair 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.569
 what am I using is this what can 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.090
 buy at any pharmacy is not worth 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:54.970
 almost nothing 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.520
 Now we will let it melt 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.470
 and I will also add 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.910
 this blister this is from the mark of a 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.860
 hair that is for hair loss 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.810
 can use any and if not 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.410
 they have not only have to throw 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.410
 obligatorily 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:13.730
 once it's all melted we're going to 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:18.049
 continue with the recipe 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:20.090
 and I already have all the mixture well melted 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:21.920
 he has added a stream of water 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.769
 approximately 5 tablespoons of 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.860
 cold water and now that it's outside the 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:29.910
 fire is when I'm going to add 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.910
 the blister 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.750
 and now the trick for us to have one 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.010
 mix well tense like this I have 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.930
 here that is what I wear now 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:44.989
 same is to add 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:47.030
 a spoonful of shea butter has 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:50.450
 ones that are not going to melt 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.330
 she does not have 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.150
 very high 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.860
 and we are going to also add a big whole 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:01.250
 of our conditioner we're 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:04.010
 using the first mix 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.510
 that I made him use a very cheap one 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.400
 that I sold in my supermarket that did not 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.170
 it cost more than one euro 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.189
 and in our staff how long 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.189
 will be the one who wants 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:22.139
 sometimes you have to beat with a blender and 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:25.409
 it will be ready 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:28.680
 the girls already finish mixing it 

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:31.560
 I did with a fork because this machine 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.879
 the minipimer did not want to work like that 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.400
 that nothing can also do with the 

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:36.960
 hands 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:40.380
 perfectly the only difference of the 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:42.030
 first mix that we have is that it is the 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.190
 second mix and more amount of 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:50.090
 olive oil and that's why he stayed with a 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:50.090
 yellow color both and ready and you're done 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:55.570
 I hope you like it and we'll see you in another 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.570
 Kisses thing
