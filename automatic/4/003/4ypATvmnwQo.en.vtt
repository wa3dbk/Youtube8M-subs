00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
space I what I was looking out at the

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.279 
space I what I was looking out at the
first<00:00:49.530> time<00:00:49.739> I'm<00:00:50.070> just<00:00:50.340> like<00:00:50.520> okay<00:00:51.239> as<00:00:51.570> bestest

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
first time I'm just like okay as bestest

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.810 
first time I'm just like okay as bestest
got<00:00:52.710> stupid<00:00:54.020> pretty<00:00:55.020> much<00:00:55.170> because<00:00:55.820> these

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
got stupid pretty much because these

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.430 
got stupid pretty much because these
positions<00:00:57.390> here<00:00:57.660> don't<00:00:57.989> make<00:00:58.140> sense<00:00:58.440> for

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
positions here don't make sense for

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.420 
positions here don't make sense for
double<00:01:01.440> giant<00:01:01.649> bombs<00:01:03.890> because<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.070> party

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
double giant bombs because the party

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.480 
double giant bombs because the party
doesn't<00:01:05.610> exist<00:01:06.030> ER<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.920> it<00:01:07.920> turns<00:01:08.130> out<00:01:08.280> that's

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
doesn't exist ER and it turns out that's

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.480 
doesn't exist ER and it turns out that's
where<00:01:08.729> they<00:01:08.850> were<00:01:09.350> so<00:01:10.350> it's<00:01:10.530> doubly<00:01:11.010> stupid<00:01:11.400> I

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
where they were so it's doubly stupid I

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:17.149 
where they were so it's doubly stupid I
guess<00:01:13.729> and<00:01:14.729> just<00:01:15.509> extremely<00:01:15.990> easy<00:01:16.259> to<00:01:16.439> pick

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
guess and just extremely easy to pick

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.800 
guess and just extremely easy to pick
apart<00:01:17.280> so<00:01:17.640> there's<00:01:17.790> no<00:01:17.909> threat<00:01:18.360> to<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.659> Hogs

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
apart so there's no threat to the Hogs

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.700 
apart so there's no threat to the Hogs
