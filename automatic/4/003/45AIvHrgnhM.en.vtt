00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.000 
pretty frequently i'd say around fifty
percent<00:02:30.340> of<00:02:30.460> the<00:02:30.550> time<00:02:30.700> and<00:02:31.680> you<00:02:32.680> can

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
percent of the time and you can

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.380 
percent of the time and you can
basically<00:02:33.220> just<00:02:33.490> sit<00:02:33.670> over<00:02:33.880> here<00:02:33.910> and<00:02:34.180> a<00:02:34.210> one

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
basically just sit over here and a one

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
basically just sit over here and a one
hit<00:02:34.540> them<00:02:34.660> all<00:02:34.870> day<00:02:35.730> so<00:02:36.730> it's<00:02:36.910> not<00:02:37.090> exactly<00:02:37.930> too

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
hit them all day so it's not exactly too

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.380 
hit them all day so it's not exactly too
hard<00:02:38.740> for<00:02:38.830> levels<00:02:39.460> or<00:02:39.670> high<00:02:39.910> levels<00:02:40.240> it

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
hard for levels or high levels it

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.270 
hard for levels or high levels it
doesn't<00:02:40.690> really<00:02:40.780> matter<00:02:40.990> it's<00:02:41.950> really<00:02:42.130> good

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
doesn't really matter it's really good

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.980 
doesn't really matter it's really good
to<00:02:42.460> a<00:02:42.640> start<00:02:43.450> summoning<00:02:44.640> so<00:02:45.690> guess<00:02:46.690> that's<00:02:46.900> all

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:46.990 
to a start summoning so guess that's all

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.080 
to a start summoning so guess that's all
