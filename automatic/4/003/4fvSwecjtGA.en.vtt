00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
so the industry is used to doing things

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.050 
so the industry is used to doing things
this<00:05:24.449> way<00:05:24.509> and<00:05:24.900> they<00:05:25.410> can<00:05:25.710> because<00:05:26.580> even<00:05:27.030> now

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
this way and they can because even now
