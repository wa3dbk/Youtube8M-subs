going to be making a falcon and in order

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.090 
going to be making a falcon and in order
to<00:00:18.029> do<00:00:18.180> this<00:00:18.390> you<00:00:19.020> want<00:00:19.380> to<00:00:19.590> start<00:00:19.920> off<00:00:20.070> by

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
to do this you want to start off by

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.500 
to do this you want to start off by
making<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.850> valley<00:00:21.119> fold<00:00:21.420> diagonally<00:00:22.130> like<00:00:23.130> so

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:26.510 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:32.179 

make<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.539> good<00:00:28.349> crease<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:30.890> you're<00:00:31.890> going<00:00:32.099> to

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
make a good crease and you're going to

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.250 
make a good crease and you're going to
measure<00:00:32.340> about<00:00:32.520> a<00:00:32.730> centimeter<00:00:33.510> up<00:00:33.719> from<00:00:34.110> that

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
measure about a centimeter up from that

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.110 
measure about a centimeter up from that
edge<00:00:34.500> that<00:00:34.800> you<00:00:34.890> just<00:00:35.100> made<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.640> you're<00:00:35.880> going

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
edge that you just made and you're going

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.290 
edge that you just made and you're going
to<00:00:36.149> pleat<00:00:36.570> that<00:00:36.600> edge<00:00:37.399> back<00:00:38.399> up<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.059> top

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
to pleat that edge back up to the top

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.900 
to pleat that edge back up to the top
like<00:00:40.170> so<00:00:42.829> from<00:00:43.829> there<00:00:44.040> you're<00:00:44.430> going<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.670> take

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
like so from there you're going to take

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.350 
like so from there you're going to take
each<00:00:45.120> wing<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:46.399> you're<00:00:47.399> just<00:00:47.610> going<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:47.910> swing

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
each wing and you're just going to swing

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.740 
each wing and you're just going to swing
it<00:00:48.390> in<00:00:48.750> until<00:00:49.469> this<00:00:49.739> edge<00:00:50.120> meets<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.390> crease

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
it in until this edge meets the crease

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:58.819 
it in until this edge meets the crease
of<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.559> baseline<00:00:53.250> what<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:53.610> just<00:00:53.789> made

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.829 

and<00:00:58.920> from<00:00:59.670> there<00:00:59.850> you're<00:00:59.999> going<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.359> take<00:01:00.539> just

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:00.839 
and from there you're going to take just

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:05.270 
and from there you're going to take just
a<00:01:00.989> little<00:01:01.530> bit<00:01:01.820> more<00:01:02.820> than<00:01:03.120> halfway<00:01:03.390> down<00:01:04.280> move

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
a little bit more than halfway down move

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.910 
a little bit more than halfway down move
from<00:01:05.489> there<00:01:05.759> to<00:01:06.000> this<00:01:06.899> access<00:01:07.380> point<00:01:07.409> and

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
from there to this access point and

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.800 
from there to this access point and
you're<00:01:08.759> going<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.119> swing<00:01:09.450> this<00:01:09.780> swing<00:01:10.399> back<00:01:11.399> up

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
you're going to swing this swing back up

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.910 
you're going to swing this swing back up
so<00:01:12.810> that<00:01:12.960> kind<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.200> forms<00:01:13.710> outward<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:15.920> you're

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
so that kind of forms outward and you're

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.230 
so that kind of forms outward and you're
going<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.130> do<00:01:17.280> just<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.700> same<00:01:17.970> with<00:01:18.119> the

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
going to do just the same with the

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:39.529 
going to do just the same with the
opposite<00:01:18.750> side<00:01:37.850> and<00:01:38.850> now<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.209> you've<00:01:39.330> got

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:39.539 
opposite side and now that you've got

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:41.899 
opposite side and now that you've got
that<00:01:39.750> you're<00:01:40.500> going<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:40.979> flip<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.759> whole

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
that you're going to flip the whole

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.570 
that you're going to flip the whole
thing<00:01:41.970> over<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:44.030> you're<00:01:45.030> going<00:01:45.330> to<00:01:46.340> make<00:01:47.340> a

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
thing over and you're going to make a

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.190 
thing over and you're going to make a
crease<00:01:47.959> that's<00:01:48.959> Valley<00:01:50.539> point<00:01:51.539> it<00:01:51.630> up<00:01:51.810> like

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
crease that's Valley point it up like

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.969 
crease that's Valley point it up like
this<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:55.700> you're<00:01:56.700> going<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:57.000> pleat<00:01:57.390> that<00:01:57.600> edge

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
this and you're going to pleat that edge

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:04.190 
this and you're going to pleat that edge
back<00:01:58.979> down<00:01:59.450> like<00:02:00.450> so<00:02:02.450> so<00:02:03.450> now<00:02:03.720> you<00:02:03.780> can<00:02:04.050> see

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
back down like so so now you can see

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.809 
back down like so so now you can see
it's<00:02:04.349> going<00:02:04.649> to<00:02:04.739> start<00:02:04.950> taking<00:02:05.190> more<00:02:05.369> of<00:02:05.640> a

00:02:05.809 --> 00:02:05.819 
it's going to start taking more of a

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:09.740 
it's going to start taking more of a
bird<00:02:06.090> type<00:02:06.420> shape<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:07.940> to<00:02:08.940> make<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.509> beak

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
bird type shape and to make the beak

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.770 
bird type shape and to make the beak
you're<00:02:10.259> going<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:10.830> pleat<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.640> head<00:02:12.000> down<00:02:12.330> and

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
you're going to pleat the head down and

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:20.809 
you're going to pleat the head down and
then<00:02:14.870> back<00:02:15.870> up<00:02:18.140> now<00:02:19.140> we're<00:02:19.379> ready<00:02:19.590> to<00:02:19.680> take<00:02:20.610> the

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
then back up now we're ready to take the

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.979 
then back up now we're ready to take the
entire<00:02:20.940> unit<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:22.280> do<00:02:23.280> a<00:02:23.310> valley<00:02:24.060> fold<00:02:24.360> right

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
entire unit and do a valley fold right

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:33.839 
entire unit and do a valley fold right
along<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.440> base<00:02:25.620> line<00:02:25.920> and<00:02:26.220> fold<00:02:26.640> it<00:02:26.879> in<00:02:27.000> half

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:36.390 

now<00:02:34.540> from<00:02:34.780> here<00:02:34.989> you<00:02:35.260> want<00:02:35.440> to<00:02:35.530> take<00:02:35.769> each<00:02:36.069> of

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
now from here you want to take each of

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:44.089 
now from here you want to take each of
these<00:02:36.519> wings<00:02:36.879> and<00:02:37.709> fold<00:02:38.709> them<00:02:39.069> down<00:02:39.659> like<00:02:40.659> so

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:52.040 

make<00:02:45.099> sure<00:02:45.129> that<00:02:45.340> you<00:02:45.610> do<00:02:45.730> that<00:02:45.760> on<00:02:46.150> both<00:02:46.540> sides

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.690 

and<00:02:52.410> then<00:02:52.740> you're<00:02:52.920> going<00:02:53.130> to<00:02:53.280> give<00:02:53.400> a<00:02:53.430> little

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
and then you're going to give a little

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.630 
and then you're going to give a little
more<00:02:53.940> dimension<00:02:54.240> to<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:54.660> head<00:02:55.070> by<00:02:56.070> taking<00:02:56.520> the

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
more dimension to the head by taking the

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.780 
more dimension to the head by taking the
front<00:02:56.940> here<00:02:57.270> and<00:02:57.560> folding<00:02:58.560> it<00:02:58.680> down<00:03:00.080> and<00:03:01.790> again

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
front here and folding it down and again

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:10.480 
front here and folding it down and again
on<00:03:02.970> both<00:03:03.210> sides<00:03:06.470> and<00:03:08.510> there<00:03:09.510> you<00:03:09.720> have<00:03:09.750> a

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.490 
on both sides and there you have a

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.240 
on both sides and there you have a
finished<00:03:11.490> falcon
