00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500
 Okay, so already, to successfully bring a book to the screen is not won 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.500
 and adapting a movie in game is downright risky 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.500
 But then make a good game by drawing inspiration from a movie, taken from a book 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.000
 that's just impossible. 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.200
 So watch out do not make me say what I did not say 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:16.969
 The Last of Us is not the adaptation of a movie in video games 

00:00:16.969 --> 00:00:18.520
 and yet, it's just like. 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.800
 Because yes, The Last of Us is more than just a game, 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.820
 in fact we can even say that this is one of the most beautiful tribute 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.880
 returned to the seventh art by the tenth art 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:26.960
 Yes, I decided that video games were an art. 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.980
 And besides, this tribute is entirely assumed by the developers of the game 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.460
 who have never hidden their passion for this film 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:33.860
 and its impact on their work. 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.980
 And to find out which film it is, let's go back together until 2006 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.339
 release date in all good American bookstores 

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:42.299
 from writer Cormac McCarthy's masterpiece 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.860
 I named: The Road 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.000
 or, The Road in good French. This book with oppressive stories tells us the story 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.929
 of a couple of survivors, a man and a child, trying to travel in the middle of 

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:52.340
 what remains of humanity. 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.339
 You will understand we are here in the presence of 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:57.570
 the seed that will spawn eight years later the story of Joel and Ellie 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.430
 the protagonists of the game The Last of Us 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.210
 So we could say that the authors of The Last of Us have found their 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.600
 inspiration in a novel appeared 7 years before the release of their game and 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.490
 yet this is not really the case since it is not the book but its 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.320
 film adaptation that was mentioned by the developers 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.960
 of the game, but to discover this film from the novel we need this time to make a 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.300
 little leap forward in time until 2009 because that year was coming out 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.340
 in the dark rooms a very faithful adaptation of the book and this 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.720
 adaptation would really impress the future developers of The Last of Us 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.540
 and that to such a point by the way that it's only a few times after the 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.030
 release of the film that the project The Last of Us would see the day 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.909
 So of course I strongly recommend you to watch this movie if 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.330
 you want to see for yourself the obvious affluence 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.080
 he had on The Last of Us, and watch out! This is not about 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.639
 plagiarism but more of a tribute assumed and quality 

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:13.309
 note, moreover, that the two stories could perfectly well be 

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:16.219
 the same universe, but a few years apart anyway if we hold 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.960
 account of the few elements specific to the game. 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.520
 And if all that I have just told you did not give you the desire to discover 

00:02:22.529 --> 00:02:26.379
 the book, the movie, and the video game that pays homage to them, so learn, in addition 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:29.749
 that the main actor of this film is a comedian accustomed to protecting the most 

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:31.749
 small as he crossing dangerous areas 

00:02:31.749 --> 00:02:35.009
 since it is about Viggo Mortensen, the actor who embodies Aragorn 

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:37.640
 in The Lord of the Rings. Plus, another interesting detail for movie buffs 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.760
 one of the small roles of the film The Road is held by Michael Williams 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.539
 an actor that can be found in the cult series 

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:46.539
 The Wire in the role of the charismatic Omar, yes after five seasons in 

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:49.029
 original version we can not pronounce his name otherwise. 

00:02:49.029 --> 00:02:51.349
 It is besides this same actor and its troubling scar which embodies 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:54.649
 the character of Irish, in the fourth episode of the Battlefield license. 

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:57.540
 But the real question that one is entitled to ask is: 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:58.540
 Did you know ?
