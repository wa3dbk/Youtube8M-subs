00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:09.929
 list backing the right side 

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:13.320
 jack under the lever what to try 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:16.350
 water ball now take pry 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:20.400
 I run between the lever and the swivel 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.859
 fist and start checking that is here 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:32.610
 relatively lever wheel but either 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:37.770
 it is necessary to change the lower ball upper 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:41.730
 okay i took off the right wheel to ripped off 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.670
 nuts on the bottom on the top ball between 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.789
 they put a puller specifically for me 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.789
 there is, that is, he is bursting with each other 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.969
 top and bottom ball first 1 you 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:57.719
 jump out then another nut not 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.789
 unscrew to the end that is here tore off 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.660
 unscrewed 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:06.570
 a couple of millimeters is not all I left 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:10.380
 so that it does not fly out and the bottom nut 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.540
 There is not this in principle, even if in general 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.810
 the bottom nut does not loosen until the end 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.740
 she retracts into the swivel body itself 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.770
 fist 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.070
 that is, it only gets out when 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:25.500
 the ball will break loose from the steering knuckle 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:28.369
 Only then it can be unscrewed in 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.320
 general i am now putting a stripper between them 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:34.799
 ripping off the ball with the knuckle 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.840
 removed the top ball well and not 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.430
 it was necessary to shoot it is normal 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.729
 that is tugovato 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:46.110
 moves from the elevator up and down he doesn't have 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:49.259
 Absolutely Sharov still trains now 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.780
 Pine put it in place and I will shoot 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.869
 bottom so I inserted a spacer between 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.990
 two balls will be lower now 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.119
 squeeze out 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:06.450
 lower ball too ripped off now 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:06.450
 Turn off here from the hook 13 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.750
 here is a new ball 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:25.180
 Once I will put in place as shot 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:28.840
 stop and so and put on the same dinner 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:32.170
 sequence ball inserted from below 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.100
 and and screwed already now on top 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:39.299
 we twist 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:39.299
 new nut new ball put 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.990
 tightened everything 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.310
 now put the wheel and put the car on 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.310
