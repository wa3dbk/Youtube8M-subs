00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:15.930
 androids the video 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:17.880
 well this is the new new game that 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.770
 just left has very little just 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.119
 get out and well then it 's more number than you 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.310
 eches the continuity of the page 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.349
 interfered with and then the truth is that 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.820
 It has many innovations and improvements that 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:28.740
 all this is going to be here in the 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.630
 description of this video and then nothing 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.369
 less than this is totally free of 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.290
 virus already analyzed what I have done and 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.329
 It is declared totally of the place 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.520
 ton so do not worry do not have 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.649
 afraid if they think they have a virus or 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.180
 something like that and then nothing this 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.219
 that what is being the continuity and 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.340
 the service in which it will be 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.109
 upload the file and it's going to be the mega no 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.670
 I'm just going to load mega and they say the 

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:51.899
 First night is very boring so no 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.399
 it can be a cancer and from this now more 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.719
 so you can see more or less how 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.390
 changed a bit what has been the 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.600
 graphic animation and those things for the 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.660
 style and then nothing friends so good that 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.720
 I can tell you for this we need 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:09.060
 At least we need at least 512 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.970
 of ram an 800 gigahertz processor 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.320
 good of a gigahertz or higher 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:18.260
 the truth is that it runs the truth is 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.260
 that does not demand too much 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:23.480

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.060
