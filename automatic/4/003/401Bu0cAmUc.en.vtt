because a lot of these like I said are
actually<00:03:09.269> pretty<00:03:09.389> expensive<00:03:09.780> a<00:03:10.079> really<00:03:10.439> good

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
actually pretty expensive a really good

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.619 
actually pretty expensive a really good
size<00:03:10.950> sample<00:03:11.159> it's<00:03:11.909> a<00:03:12.030> really<00:03:12.209> good<00:03:12.299> size

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:12.629 
size sample it's a really good size

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:14.270 
size sample it's a really good size
sample<00:03:12.900> for<00:03:13.290> mascara<00:03:13.650> especially<00:03:14.069> for<00:03:14.250> a

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
sample for mascara especially for a

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.629 
sample for mascara especially for a
high-end<00:03:14.430> mascaras<00:03:15.000> so<00:03:16.099> my<00:03:17.099> experience<00:03:17.519> with

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:17.639 
high-end mascaras so my experience with

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:19.369 
high-end mascaras so my experience with
these<00:03:17.760> kind<00:03:18.030> of<00:03:18.090> mascara<00:03:18.540> samples<00:03:18.989> is<00:03:19.199> that

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:19.379 
these kind of mascara samples is that

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:22.220 
these kind of mascara samples is that
generally<00:03:20.310> they<00:03:20.849> even<00:03:21.329> make<00:03:21.480> the<00:03:21.629> wand<00:03:21.870> just

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
generally they even make the wand just

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.479 
generally they even make the wand just
like<00:03:22.379> how<00:03:22.500> it<00:03:22.620> is<00:03:22.709> in<00:03:22.829> the<00:03:22.889> full-sized<00:03:23.340> version

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
like how it is in the full-sized version

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.099 
like how it is in the full-sized version

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109 
because a lot of mascara samples will

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:28.520 
because a lot of mascara samples will
just<00:03:25.260> give<00:03:25.440> you<00:03:25.470> some<00:03:26.090> bad<00:03:27.090> generic<00:03:27.810> ones<00:03:28.109> you
