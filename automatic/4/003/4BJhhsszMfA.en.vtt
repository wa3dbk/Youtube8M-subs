00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:07.440
 hello to all and thank you for being with us 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.019
 on the techno chain continue this crs 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.880
 2013 then the cs of course it's from 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.620
 the electronics these computer this 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.780
 are connected TVs the 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.070
 oled screens but it's also becoming 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.070
 more connected house 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.179
 hp envy x2 touch designed for windows 8 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:32.910
 the laptop pc that turns into 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.280
 tablet by hp and look behind 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.960
 we are on the stand of a big 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.000
 Japanese manufacturer toshiba for not 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.989
 not quote it and so we see that the 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.930
 connected house takes a place 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.449
 important with a fridge but also a 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.339
 floor a washing machine then the 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:48.629
 lights also beers also of course 

00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:49.559
 what's the use of connected home 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.659
 how it works 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.489
 answer right away actually has 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:56.370
 at toshiba we do not just 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.320
 TVs and PCs we do not do that 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.100
 we also have the chance in the countries 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.290
 such as Japan to make fridges 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.790
 finally washing machine ovens 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.270
 all the sets of products that we 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.009
 can find 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.680
 we will say that we find electronic 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:13.009
 the house and there actually we are going 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.180
 today be able to connect the whole 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:16.920
 of his products at home directly 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.360
 in the cloud and what is very 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.950
 interesting this fair drive them to 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.820
 distance directly on your 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.380
 TV for example 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.549
 then there is the fascination of the fridge 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.710
 collect it's been years that we 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.140
 spoke with tv on your stand 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.670
 he has a touch pad ahead of his 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.090
 bishops June there he has a tablet 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.280
 tactile 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.749
 we can record content by 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.950
 example say we should not forget 

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:39.659
 pause do not forget about will 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.219
 can also make a visual memo send 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.829
 to his friends because we have a tablet 

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:45.600
 who will also be connected with the 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.030
 cloud tivi that I introduced you 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.310
 above and can be directly 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.420
 interact with your friends on facebook 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.590
 or kind of things or products 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.880
 connected what does that mean 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.999
 only from your smartphone 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.280
 whether under apple platform or 

00:01:56.999 --> 00:02:00.899
 under android platform you go 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.630
 ability to remotely control your 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.369
 products and find out what they are in 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.999
 doing so typically doing on a 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.220
 washing machine 

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:11.100
 you will be able to trigger remotely 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.360
 the washing cycle of your machine to 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.890
 wash when you want for example 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.520
 back from the office 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.860
 and put your 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.420
 our product en route you can the 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.910
 trigger when you leave the office 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:25.120
 you can also trigger it to 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.080
 distance for example over periods where 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.450
 you will be able to save money 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.410
 of energy saving water so a 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.000
 consumer point of view it's 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.940
 extremely interesting and from a point of 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.250
 energy consumption view was 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.810
 also extremely important at lg 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.730
 all products are 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.080
 now connected one of the very good 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.770
 example it is particularly at the level of 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.390
 refrigerators 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.620
 you're going to tell me but why is this 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.720
 that a refrigerator will be connected 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.850
 it's very simple it will allow you 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.330
 to manage automatically and also to 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.980
 distance 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.050
 everything you will have in your 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.830
 refrigerator in terms of products 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.940
 still fresh 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.820
 so they are who is in the 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.340
 refrigerator to check also the 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.890
 dates of validity and 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.379
 the dlc of your products to be sure of 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.090
 always consume the products before 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:09.890
 deadline is a very simple example 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.810
 which goes in simplicity for them 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.459
 consumers if you are at the market 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.650
 you know more than you have in the 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.660
 refrigerator with your phone you 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.890
 will be able to know from a distance what 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.510
 you stay in the refrigerator and 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.549
 so to be able to buy the products 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.410
 you really need 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:26.269
 other feature on the 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.069
 refrigerators it's you have a 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:30.140
 menu feature that will you 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:32.120
 allow automatically from 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:36.650
 products you have two left to have 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:38.299
 meals offered directly from 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.310
 of your refrigerator and so so 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:41.989
 all this service works with her from 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.610
 which software environment then the 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:46.160
 communication protocols use 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:49.489
 the wifi standards it's these are only 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.140
 two information energy we will 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:53.540
 to say that they are sent to a box that 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.950
 the use of interfaces we will say 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.420
 standardized agree for after 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:57.739
 communicate directly with the cloud 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:59.989
 stone that the floor the washing machine 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:01.730
 the fridge are collected at boxing the 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.769
 house exactly know in japan he 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.690
 uses a network called econet 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:07.819
 who use the protocols of 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.380
 own communication in Japan and who 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:10.940
 exist that is not labeled in 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.040
 europe and united states so it's for 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.019
 it's used in Japan that allows 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.239
 to connect washing machine and so on and 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:17.690
 so directly said certainly in 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.400
 Europe 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.460
 we are also working on solutions from 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.050
 smart home who will power who is going 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.210
 allow during those to connect 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:29.510
 all of its electrical products 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:31.190
 agree to catch or box 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.870
 directly and makeen other systems 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.880
 exactly then we see that the 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.800
 Asian builders are thoroughly there 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.300
 unhappy top honoring his share they 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.190
 are ahead unfortunately this does not 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.510
 not really concerned yet it does 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.650
 laugh too a little bit like she 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.320
 connected house it's true we say 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.500
 good the fridge with the tablet what it 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.500
 serves 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:50.780
 for sure it's a bit of a fantasy and 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:54.290
 then the price too is it okay 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:56.750
 very expensive all that but me that it me me 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:58.400
 falls well it's a fridge with a 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.840
 small a little touch pad on it 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.160
 that's good but it's the logic of 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.880
 screens everywhere in cars and 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.560
 also on the fridges 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.330
 the techno chain all news high 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:09.370
 tech so on the tv point techno channel 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.370
 01net has very quickly hi to all
