in this tutorial I'm going to show how

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:07.599 
in this tutorial I'm going to show how
to<00:00:05.750> save<00:00:06.109> a<00:00:06.140> PowerPoint<00:00:06.800> presentation<00:00:06.859> as<00:00:07.580> a

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:10.849 
template I'm also going to show how to

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:13.270 
template I'm also going to show how to
apply<00:00:11.420> the<00:00:11.540> current<00:00:12.170> university<00:00:12.500> template<00:00:13.100> as

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:13.280 
apply the current university template as

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.119 
apply the current university template as
a<00:00:13.340> default<00:00:13.880> template<00:00:14.780> to<00:00:15.110> current<00:00:15.590> and<00:00:15.860> new

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:16.129 
a default template to current and new

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:18.640 
a default template to current and new
powerpoints<00:00:16.850> that<00:00:17.000> you<00:00:17.119> create<00:00:17.480> so<00:00:18.410> to<00:00:18.529> get

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:18.650 
powerpoints that you create so to get

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.010 
powerpoints that you create so to get
started<00:00:18.859> open<00:00:19.460> PowerPoint<00:00:20.270> first<00:00:20.750> and<00:00:20.960> I'm

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.020 
started open PowerPoint first and I'm

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.040 
started open PowerPoint first and I'm
using<00:00:21.260> PowerPoint<00:00:21.800> 2010<00:00:22.430> and<00:00:22.730> usually<00:00:23.690> when

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
using PowerPoint 2010 and usually when

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.290 
using PowerPoint 2010 and usually when
you<00:00:24.230> create<00:00:24.650> a<00:00:24.680> new<00:00:24.770> PowerPoint<00:00:25.490> by<00:00:25.760> default

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
you create a new PowerPoint by default

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.840 
you create a new PowerPoint by default
the<00:00:26.810> design<00:00:27.440> is<00:00:27.680> going<00:00:27.860> to<00:00:27.920> be<00:00:28.039> just<00:00:28.340> a<00:00:28.490> blank

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:28.850 
the design is going to be just a blank

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.269 
the design is going to be just a blank
white<00:00:29.390> template<00:00:30.050> when<00:00:30.650> you<00:00:30.800> change<00:00:31.160> the

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 
white template when you change the

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:33.910 
white template when you change the
design<00:00:31.610> you'd<00:00:32.329> go<00:00:32.539> under<00:00:32.780> designs<00:00:33.260> and<00:00:33.710> then

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
design you'd go under designs and then

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.850 
design you'd go under designs and then
apply<00:00:34.399> one<00:00:34.730> of<00:00:34.760> those<00:00:35.090> predefined<00:00:36.079> templates

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
apply one of those predefined templates

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.130 
apply one of those predefined templates
that<00:00:36.980> already<00:00:37.370> exist<00:00:37.760> or<00:00:38.000> themes<00:00:38.840> that

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
that already exist or themes that

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.720 
that already exist or themes that
already<00:00:39.500> exist<00:00:39.890> in<00:00:40.070> the<00:00:40.130> PowerPoint

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
already exist in the PowerPoint

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.970 
already exist in the PowerPoint
application<00:00:41.260> so<00:00:42.260> for<00:00:42.440> example<00:00:42.710> we're<00:00:42.860> going

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
application so for example we're going

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.880 
application so for example we're going
to<00:00:43.070> apply<00:00:43.309> this<00:00:43.460> or<00:00:44.030> any<00:00:44.420> of<00:00:44.570> those<00:00:44.780> that's<00:00:45.649> how

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
to apply this or any of those that's how

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.100 
to apply this or any of those that's how
you<00:00:45.950> traditionally<00:00:46.730> change<00:00:47.090> them<00:00:47.329> so<00:00:47.510> the

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
you traditionally change them so the

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.069 
you traditionally change them so the
question<00:00:48.559> is<00:00:48.770> how<00:00:49.460> can<00:00:49.640> we<00:00:49.670> apply<00:00:50.149> one<00:00:50.719> that<00:00:50.930> we

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
question is how can we apply one that we

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:53.620 
question is how can we apply one that we
have<00:00:51.260> already<00:00:51.680> created<00:00:51.920> and<00:00:52.610> defined<00:00:53.239> and

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:53.630 
have already created and defined and

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.440 
have already created and defined and
designed<00:00:54.230> out<00:00:54.500> there<00:00:54.800> and<00:00:55.149> reuse<00:00:56.149> that<00:00:56.390> same

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:56.450 
designed out there and reuse that same

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.010 
designed out there and reuse that same
template<00:00:57.230> for<00:00:57.649> other<00:00:58.010> applications<00:00:58.870> what<00:00:59.870> we

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
template for other applications what we

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.560 
template for other applications what we
need<00:01:00.170> to<00:01:00.320> do<00:01:00.559> is<00:01:00.860> first<00:01:01.550> open<00:01:02.149> an<00:01:02.420> existing

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
need to do is first open an existing

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.380 
need to do is first open an existing
PowerPoint<00:01:03.289> that<00:01:03.829> we<00:01:04.129> prefer<00:01:04.670> and<00:01:05.089> that<00:01:05.239> we

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
PowerPoint that we prefer and that we

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.710 
PowerPoint that we prefer and that we
like<00:01:05.659> for<00:01:06.250> here<00:01:07.250> at<00:01:07.400> Karen<00:01:07.729> University<00:01:08.390> the

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
like for here at Karen University the

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.100 
like for here at Karen University the
templates<00:01:09.290> are<00:01:09.409> located<00:01:09.979> on<00:01:10.159> K<00:01:10.840> forms<00:01:11.840> and

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
templates are located on K forms and

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.910 
templates are located on K forms and
then<00:01:12.710> brand<00:01:13.250> folder<00:01:14.090> then<00:01:14.900> you<00:01:15.020> go<00:01:15.229> under<00:01:15.710> the

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
then brand folder then you go under the

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.820 
then brand folder then you go under the
PowerPoint<00:01:16.790> templates<00:01:17.720> folder<00:01:17.900> and<00:01:18.260> open<00:01:18.799> the

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
PowerPoint templates folder and open the

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.429 
PowerPoint templates folder and open the
Karen<00:01:19.610> template<00:01:20.229> 2012<00:01:21.640> once<00:01:22.640> you<00:01:22.880> open<00:01:23.299> it

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:23.439 
Karen template 2012 once you open it

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:27.760 
Karen template 2012 once you open it
you'll<00:01:24.439> see<00:01:24.710> something<00:01:25.280> similar<00:01:25.640> to<00:01:26.060> this<00:01:26.770> so

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
you'll see something similar to this so

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.700 
you'll see something similar to this so
the<00:01:27.890> question<00:01:28.340> is<00:01:28.520> how<00:01:28.939> can<00:01:29.360> we<00:01:29.390> make<00:01:29.570> this<00:01:30.200> the

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
the question is how can we make this the

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.820 
the question is how can we make this the
default<00:01:30.890> template<00:01:31.900> so<00:01:32.900> it<00:01:33.020> shows<00:01:33.350> up<00:01:33.619> under

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
default template so it shows up under

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.810 
default template so it shows up under
designs<00:01:34.420> as<00:01:35.420> well<00:01:35.810> as<00:01:36.159> when<00:01:37.159> we<00:01:37.340> open<00:01:37.729> a<00:01:37.790> new

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
designs as well as when we open a new

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.030 
designs as well as when we open a new
PowerPoint<00:01:38.330> that<00:01:38.840> template<00:01:39.320> will<00:01:39.439> be<00:01:39.470> applied

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
PowerPoint that template will be applied

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.550 
PowerPoint that template will be applied
automatically<00:01:40.939> so<00:01:41.750> what<00:01:41.900> we<00:01:42.020> do<00:01:42.170> in<00:01:42.259> this<00:01:42.380> case

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
automatically so what we do in this case

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.730 
automatically so what we do in this case
it's<00:01:42.799> actually<00:01:43.100> very<00:01:43.189> simple<00:01:43.610> we<00:01:44.320> go<00:01:45.320> under

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
it's actually very simple we go under

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.630 
it's actually very simple we go under
the<00:01:45.890> design<00:01:46.250> tab<00:01:46.310> and<00:01:46.960> then<00:01:48.340> scroll<00:01:49.340> all<00:01:49.579> the

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
the design tab and then scroll all the

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.450 
the design tab and then scroll all the
way<00:01:49.909> to<00:01:50.090> the<00:01:50.329> bottom<00:01:50.689> here<00:01:50.930> and<00:01:50.960> you'll<00:01:51.259> see

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
way to the bottom here and you'll see

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.910 
way to the bottom here and you'll see
save<00:01:52.460> current<00:01:53.000> template<00:01:53.689> so<00:01:54.530> we<00:01:54.590> click<00:01:54.799> on

save current template so we click on
save<00:01:55.479> and<00:01:56.479> we<00:01:56.750> give<00:01:56.960> it<00:01:57.049> a<00:01:57.140> new<00:01:57.320> name

00:01:58.319 --> 00:01:58.329 
save and we give it a new name

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.369 

in<00:02:52.840> designing<00:02:53.680> a<00:02:53.739> PowerPoint<00:02:54.810> now<00:02:55.810> how<00:02:55.989> can<00:02:56.200> we

00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:56.379 
in designing a PowerPoint now how can we

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:59.280 
in designing a PowerPoint now how can we
make<00:02:56.620> it<00:02:56.650> so<00:02:57.310> that<00:02:57.340> anytime<00:02:58.239> we<00:02:58.480> create<00:02:58.900> a<00:02:58.930> new

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
make it so that anytime we create a new

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.570 
make it so that anytime we create a new
PowerPoint<00:03:00.129> this<00:03:01.060> would<00:03:01.390> be<00:03:01.629> the<00:03:02.019> default<00:03:02.580> and

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
PowerPoint this would be the default and

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.850 
PowerPoint this would be the default and
this<00:03:03.819> is<00:03:03.970> very<00:03:04.150> easy<00:03:04.239> to<00:03:04.599> do<00:03:04.750> as<00:03:04.959> well<00:03:05.200> so<00:03:05.230> we<00:03:05.560> go

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
this is very easy to do as well so we go

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.720 
this is very easy to do as well so we go
under<00:03:06.159> designs<00:03:06.640> and<00:03:07.060> then<00:03:07.959> we<00:03:08.769> go<00:03:09.010> on<00:03:09.370> a<00:03:09.430> drop

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
under designs and then we go on a drop

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.539 
under designs and then we go on a drop
down<00:03:09.909> here<00:03:10.030> under<00:03:10.930> the<00:03:10.959> custom<00:03:11.500> templates<00:03:11.980> and

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.970 
we choose to make this as a default
theme<00:03:16.980> so<00:03:17.980> once<00:03:18.159> we<00:03:18.310> click<00:03:18.430> on<00:03:18.640> default<00:03:18.819> theme
