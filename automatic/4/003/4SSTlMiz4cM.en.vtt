00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.990 
literally want you to open up your hand
like<00:01:48.240> this<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:49.229> where<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.560> racket<00:01:50.100> butt<00:01:50.310> faces

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
like this to where the racket butt faces

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.480 
like this to where the racket butt faces
the<00:01:51.180> sky<00:01:51.590> just<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.710> get<00:01:52.860> that<00:01:53.009> feeling<00:01:53.399> of

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
the sky just to get that feeling of

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.520 
the sky just to get that feeling of
relaxation<00:01:54.090> I<00:01:54.390> think<00:01:54.630> this<00:01:54.750> is<00:01:54.899> why<00:01:55.079> lots<00:01:55.439> of

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
relaxation I think this is why lots of

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.340 
relaxation I think this is why lots of
people<00:01:55.799> can't<00:01:56.130> get<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.299> racket<00:01:57.869> drop<00:01:58.020> it's

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
people can't get the racket drop it's

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.080 
people can't get the racket drop it's
not<00:01:58.590> that<00:01:59.009> they're<00:01:59.159> not<00:01:59.189> flexible<00:01:59.939> enough

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
not that they're not flexible enough

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.240 
not that they're not flexible enough
it's<00:02:00.450> that<00:02:00.540> they<00:02:00.689> hold<00:02:01.290> their<00:02:01.530> hand<00:02:01.799> too<00:02:02.009> tight

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
it's that they hold their hand too tight

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.039 
it's that they hold their hand too tight
so<00:02:02.460> if<00:02:02.520> you<00:02:02.610> hold<00:02:02.820> your<00:02:03.030> hand<00:02:03.299> tight<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:04.020> whole

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
so if you hold your hand tight the whole

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.660 
so if you hold your hand tight the whole
way<00:02:04.259> you<00:02:04.320> get<00:02:04.530> to<00:02:04.680> about<00:02:04.829> here<00:02:05.219> and<00:02:05.340> then<00:02:05.490> you

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
way you get to about here and then you

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.930 
way you get to about here and then you
start<00:02:06.540> messing<00:02:06.689> forward<00:02:07.320> but<00:02:07.439> if<00:02:07.560> you<00:02:07.649> can

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
start messing forward but if you can

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.050 
start messing forward but if you can
start<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.149> learn<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.629> just<00:02:10.550> dangle<00:02:11.550> there<00:02:11.790> you

the link here but if you haven't seen my

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.700 
the link here but if you haven't seen my
free<00:05:16.940> syrup<00:05:17.390> progression<00:05:17.930> it's<00:05:18.050> about<00:05:18.230> 15

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
free syrup progression it's about 15

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.120 
free syrup progression it's about 15
minutes<00:05:18.950> long<00:05:19.160> and<00:05:19.780> we<00:05:20.780> cover<00:05:21.080> a<00:05:21.470> little<00:05:21.980> bit

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.130 
minutes long and we cover a little bit

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:23.710 
minutes long and we cover a little bit
more<00:05:22.220> in<00:05:22.400> the<00:05:22.490> self<00:05:22.790> we<00:05:22.940> also<00:05:23.090> go<00:05:23.390> over<00:05:23.420> move

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720 
more in the self we also go over move

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.640 
more in the self we also go over move
called<00:05:24.020> the<00:05:24.080> seesaw<00:05:24.680> we've<00:05:25.670> got<00:05:26.050> the<00:05:27.050> tuck<00:05:27.380> in

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
called the seesaw we've got the tuck in

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:29.770 
called the seesaw we've got the tuck in
there<00:05:27.890> it's<00:05:28.130> it's<00:05:28.310> kind<00:05:28.580> of<00:05:28.640> a<00:05:28.700> cool<00:05:28.880> way<00:05:28.910> to

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
there it's it's kind of a cool way to

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.000 
there it's it's kind of a cool way to
think<00:05:29.930> about<00:05:30.020> the<00:05:30.230> syrup<00:05:30.440> from<00:05:30.560> beginning<00:05:30.950> to

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.010 
think about the syrup from beginning to

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.180 
think about the syrup from beginning to
end<00:05:31.040> and<00:05:31.600> and<00:05:32.600> make<00:05:33.260> it<00:05:33.470> into<00:05:33.740> a<00:05:33.770> flowing

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190 
end and and make it into a flowing

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:35.890 
end and and make it into a flowing
progression<00:05:34.940> so<00:05:35.060> if<00:05:35.120> you've<00:05:35.240> not<00:05:35.570> checked

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
progression so if you've not checked

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:40.390 
progression so if you've not checked
that<00:05:36.320> out<00:05:36.380> yet<00:05:36.560> you<00:05:37.550> can<00:05:37.850> click<00:05:38.510> here<00:05:39.400> below

that out yet you can click here below

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.280 
that out yet you can click here below
there<00:05:41.030> may<00:05:41.270> also<00:05:41.510> I<00:05:41.690> think<00:05:41.930> if<00:05:42.050> you're<00:05:42.200> on

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:42.290
