base and then bass okay

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.260 
base and then bass okay
after<00:01:08.790> that<00:01:09.350> the<00:01:10.350> measure<00:01:10.680> is<00:01:10.979> so<00:01:11.340> easy<00:01:11.790> we're

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
after that the measure is so easy we're

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.920 
after that the measure is so easy we're
just<00:01:12.299> going<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.600> go<00:01:12.780> three<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.979> four<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:17.930> we

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
just going to go three and four and we

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.510 
just going to go three and four and we
don't<00:01:19.110> even<00:01:19.259> play<00:01:19.530> bass<00:01:19.799> for<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.159> rest<00:01:20.340> of<00:01:20.460> the

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
don't even play bass for the rest of the

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.030 
don't even play bass for the rest of the
measure<00:01:20.729> it's<00:01:21.000> great<00:01:21.270> so<00:01:21.780> here<00:01:22.530> we<00:01:22.650> go<00:01:22.799> the

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
measure it's great so here we go the

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:44.469 
measure it's great so here we go the
whole<00:01:23.250> thing<00:01:23.520> together

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.270 

all<00:01:45.479> right<00:01:45.689> so<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.380> trickiest<00:01:46.740> part<00:01:47.069> about

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
all right so the trickiest part about

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.300 
all right so the trickiest part about
this<00:01:47.549> is<00:01:47.880> those<00:01:48.450> doubles<00:01:49.350> on<00:01:49.679> the<00:01:49.740> bass<00:01:50.280> drum

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
this is those doubles on the bass drum

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.639 
this is those doubles on the bass drum
there's<00:01:50.819> two<00:01:51.060> sixteenth<00:01:51.600> notes<00:01:51.810> right<00:01:52.259> beside

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
there's two sixteenth notes right beside

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.789 
there's two sixteenth notes right beside
each<00:01:52.679> other<00:01:53.539> it<00:01:54.539> gets<00:01:54.840> tricky<00:01:55.350> because<00:01:55.380> you

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
each other it gets tricky because you

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.919 
each other it gets tricky because you
increase<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.490> speed<00:01:56.700> on<00:01:57.060> this<00:01:57.179> beat<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:57.659> it

00:01:57.919 --> 00:01:57.929 
increase the speed on this beat and it

00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:59.809 
increase the speed on this beat and it
can<00:01:58.079> be<00:01:58.200> kind<00:01:58.469> of<00:01:58.590> hard<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:59.009> keep<00:01:59.219> it<00:01:59.429> in<00:01:59.579> the

00:01:59.809 --> 00:01:59.819 
can be kind of hard to keep it in the

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:03.080 
can be kind of hard to keep it in the
pocket<00:02:00.200> so<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.530> best<00:02:01.709> way<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:01.950> do<00:02:02.280> that<00:02:02.490> is<00:02:02.819> to

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
pocket so the best way to do that is to

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.419 
pocket so the best way to do that is to
incorporate<00:02:03.539> some<00:02:04.110> technique<00:02:04.649> like<00:02:04.890> slide

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:05.429 
incorporate some technique like slide

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:08.749 
incorporate some technique like slide
technique<00:02:05.880> or<00:02:06.619> heel-toe<00:02:07.619> technique<00:02:08.220> on<00:02:08.399> the

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
technique or heel-toe technique on the

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.479 
technique or heel-toe technique on the
bass<00:02:08.910> drum<00:02:09.299> I<00:02:09.709> have<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:10.739> video<00:02:11.099> about

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
bass drum I have a video about

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.420 
bass drum I have a video about
increasing<00:02:12.360> your<00:02:12.390> bass<00:02:13.079> drum<00:02:13.110> speed<00:02:13.920> and<00:02:14.310> it

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
increasing your bass drum speed and it

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.330 
increasing your bass drum speed and it
touches<00:02:14.760> on<00:02:15.060> some<00:02:15.299> ideas<00:02:15.930> and<00:02:16.230> touches<00:02:17.160> on

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
touches on some ideas and touches on

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.809 
touches on some ideas and touches on
slide<00:02:18.150> technique<00:02:18.769> I'll<00:02:19.769> put<00:02:20.069> the<00:02:20.190> link<00:02:20.400> right

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
slide technique I'll put the link right

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.240 
slide technique I'll put the link right
here<00:02:20.880> but<00:02:21.690> I<00:02:21.720> encourage<00:02:22.260> you<00:02:22.500> if<00:02:22.680> you<00:02:22.829> if<00:02:23.040> you

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
aren't locked into one of those yet then

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.759 
aren't locked into one of those yet then
watch<00:02:25.799> videos<00:02:26.310> on<00:02:26.670> heel-toe<00:02:27.329> watch<00:02:28.019> videos<00:02:28.500> on

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
watch videos on heel-toe watch videos on

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:30.619 
watch videos on heel-toe watch videos on
slide<00:02:29.040> technique<00:02:29.370> feel<00:02:29.910> them<00:02:30.060> both<00:02:30.239> out<00:02:30.450> and

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
slide technique feel them both out and

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:33.020 
slide technique feel them both out and
see<00:02:30.840> which<00:02:30.989> one<00:02:31.290> just<00:02:31.950> comes<00:02:32.160> more<00:02:32.400> naturally

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
see which one just comes more naturally

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.870 
see which one just comes more naturally
to<00:02:33.060> you<00:02:33.480> and<00:02:33.810> then<00:02:33.989> just<00:02:34.230> take<00:02:34.500> that<00:02:34.709> and<00:02:35.040> work

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
to you and then just take that and work

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.949 
to you and then just take that and work
with<00:02:35.910> it<00:02:36.260> now<00:02:37.260> about<00:02:37.650> this<00:02:37.920> groove<00:02:38.540> it<00:02:39.540> really

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
with it now about this groove it really

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.860 
with it now about this groove it really
grooves<00:02:40.790> it<00:02:41.790> is<00:02:41.940> a<00:02:41.970> group<00:02:42.269> so<00:02:42.510> I<00:02:42.540> guess<00:02:42.720> it

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
grooves it is a group so I guess it

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.129 
grooves it is a group so I guess it
should<00:02:43.049> I<00:02:43.980> really<00:02:44.790> it<00:02:45.180> works<00:02:45.420> a<00:02:45.660> lot<00:02:45.810> of<00:02:45.870> things

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:46.139 
should I really it works a lot of things

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:48.020 
should I really it works a lot of things
but<00:02:46.319> I<00:02:46.380> do<00:02:46.500> really<00:02:46.950> like<00:02:47.280> it<00:02:47.340> when<00:02:47.609> the<00:02:47.790> bass

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
but I do really like it when the bass

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.509 
but I do really like it when the bass
player<00:02:48.359> locks<00:02:48.780> in<00:02:49.049> with<00:02:49.380> that<00:02:49.590> bass<00:02:49.920> drum<00:02:50.250> part

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
player locks in with that bass drum part

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.699 
player locks in with that bass drum part
and<00:02:50.760> both<00:02:51.209> of<00:02:51.389> them<00:02:51.540> at<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:51.810> same<00:02:51.989> time<00:02:52.049> just

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
and both of them at the same time just

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:58.370 
and both of them at the same time just
like<00:02:52.769> doh-doh<00:02:53.359> doh-doh<00:02:55.310> did<00:02:56.310> it<00:02:56.519> that<00:02:57.450> a<00:02:57.480> I<00:02:57.959> can

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
like doh-doh doh-doh did it that a I can

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.309 
like doh-doh doh-doh did it that a I can
sound<00:02:58.709> really<00:02:59.150> Rocking<00:03:00.150> I<00:03:00.239> love<00:03:00.420> that<00:03:00.630> so

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
sound really Rocking I love that so
