good on it the performance is good and
as<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.340> said<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.640> design<00:02:02.939> it's<00:02:03.270> very

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
as I said the design it's very

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.719 
as I said the design it's very
lightweight<00:02:03.810> but<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:05.040> one<00:02:05.310> thing<00:02:05.579> it<00:02:05.700> has

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
lightweight but the one thing it has

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.749 
lightweight but the one thing it has
going<00:02:06.030> against<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:06.750> is<00:02:06.960> that<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:08.129> competition

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
going against it is that the competition

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.119 
going against it is that the competition
has<00:02:08.970> that<00:02:09.239> integrated<00:02:09.929> light<00:02:10.410> in<00:02:10.649> it<00:02:10.800> and<00:02:10.979> both

has that integrated light in it and both

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.820

the<00:02:11.310> Kindle<00:02:11.760> and<00:02:11.910> Nook<00:02:12.599> cost<00:02:13.110> $10

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830

less<00:02:14.250> than<00:02:14.520> this<00:02:14.670> so<00:02:15.270> this<00:02:15.360> is<00:02:15.420> a<00:02:15.570> little<00:02:16.020> bit

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
less than this so this is a little bit

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.020 
less than this so this is a little bit
