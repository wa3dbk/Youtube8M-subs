of<00:04:00.520> this<00:04:00.670> unit<00:04:00.730> is<00:04:01.300> so<00:04:01.840> light<00:04:02.080> that<00:04:02.410> we're<00:04:03.130> able

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
of this unit is so light that we're able

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.670 
of this unit is so light that we're able
to<00:04:03.520> incorporate<00:04:03.940> that<00:04:04.450> velcro<00:04:04.720> mounting

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
to incorporate that velcro mounting

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.250 
to incorporate that velcro mounting
system<00:04:06.390> you<00:04:07.390> turn<00:04:07.600> it<00:04:07.750> around

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
system you turn it around

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.350 
system you turn it around
another<00:04:08.650> thing<00:04:08.920> we<00:04:09.070> really<00:04:09.490> focused<00:04:09.940> on<00:04:10.090> is

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
another thing we really focused on is

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.440 
another thing we really focused on is
the<00:04:10.600> simplicity<00:04:10.840> of<00:04:11.650> use<00:04:12.130> that<00:04:12.430> was<00:04:12.910> my<00:04:13.180> main

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
the simplicity of use that was my main

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.820 
the simplicity of use that was my main
focus<00:04:14.550> the<00:04:15.550> man<00:04:15.850> kevin<00:04:16.420> Van<00:04:16.570> Dam's<00:04:16.900> main<00:04:17.290> focus

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:17.830 
focus the man kevin Van Dam's main focus

focus the man kevin Van Dam's main focus
and<00:04:18.040> everyone<00:04:18.370> involved<00:04:18.640> with<00:04:18.910> the<00:04:19.000> project's

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
and everyone involved with the project's

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:21.870 
and everyone involved with the project's
main<00:04:19.720> focus<00:04:20.140> we'd<00:04:20.650> simply<00:04:21.010> turn<00:04:21.430> it<00:04:21.549> on<00:04:21.670> with

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
main focus we'd simply turn it on with

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.440 
main focus we'd simply turn it on with
one<00:04:22.090> button<00:04:22.360> on<00:04:23.250> and<00:04:24.250> the<00:04:24.610> unit<00:04:24.940> the<00:04:25.420> unit

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
one button on and the unit the unit

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.950 
one button on and the unit the unit
fires<00:04:26.020> up<00:04:26.350> the<00:04:27.300> second<00:04:28.300> button<00:04:28.630> which<00:04:28.780> I've

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
fires up the second button which I've

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.380 
fires up the second button which I've
just<00:04:29.110> pushed<00:04:29.410> changes<00:04:30.280> it<00:04:30.460> immediately<00:04:30.880> to

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
just pushed changes it immediately to

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.840 
just pushed changes it immediately to
our<00:04:31.630> first<00:04:32.320> sound<00:04:32.560> which<00:04:32.860> is<00:04:32.890> shad<00:04:33.280> frenzy

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:33.850 
our first sound which is shad frenzy

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:35.700 
our first sound which is shad frenzy
okay<00:04:34.570> she<00:04:34.750> had<00:04:34.870> frenzies<00:04:35.290> our<00:04:35.470> most

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
okay she had frenzies our most

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.490 
okay she had frenzies our most
aggressive<00:04:35.980> sound<00:04:36.550> and<00:04:36.850> the<00:04:37.480> sound<00:04:37.720> of

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
aggressive sound and the sound of

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.430 
aggressive sound and the sound of
used<00:04:40.250> for<00:04:40.460> this<00:04:40.610> demonstration<00:04:40.990> but<00:04:41.990> if<00:04:42.290> you

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
used for this demonstration but if you

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.390 
used for this demonstration but if you
could<00:04:42.620> focus<00:04:42.800> in<00:04:43.390> on<00:04:44.390> our<00:04:44.750> display<00:04:45.020> unit<00:04:45.560> the

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
could focus in on our display unit the

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.240 
could focus in on our display unit the
display<00:04:47.120> unit<00:04:47.450> is<00:04:47.510> very<00:04:47.660> simple<00:04:48.050> it<00:04:48.200> just

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
display unit is very simple it just

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.980 
display unit is very simple it just
basically<00:04:49.250> tells<00:04:49.550> you<00:04:49.640> what<00:04:50.330> we're<00:04:50.510> about<00:04:50.660> to

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
basically tells you what we're about to

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.530 
basically tells you what we're about to
do<00:04:51.170> now<00:04:51.650> I'll<00:04:51.770> scroll<00:04:52.130> through<00:04:52.580> and<00:04:53.420> then

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:53.540 
do now I'll scroll through and then

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:54.820 
do now I'll scroll through and then
we've<00:04:53.690> got<00:04:53.900> friends<00:04:54.320> even<00:04:54.440> with<00:04:54.710> the

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
we've got friends even with the

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.370 
we've got friends even with the
30-second<00:04:55.520> delay<00:04:55.580> loop<00:04:55.940> the<00:04:56.690> shad<00:04:56.930> frenzy

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:57.380 
30-second delay loop the shad frenzy

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.380 
30-second delay loop the shad frenzy
loops<00:04:57.620> about<00:04:57.890> 52<00:04:58.430> seconds<00:04:58.850> and<00:04:59.000> then<00:04:59.120> if<00:04:59.270> you

00:04:59.380 --> 00:04:59.390 
loops about 52 seconds and then if you

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:02.320 
loops about 52 seconds and then if you
choose<00:04:59.920> 30-second<00:05:00.920> delay<00:05:01.010> loop<00:05:01.340> you<00:05:01.850> simply

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
choose 30-second delay loop you simply

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.480 
choose 30-second delay loop you simply
at<00:05:02.540> the<00:05:02.870> end<00:05:03.170> of<00:05:03.290> the<00:05:03.380> 52<00:05:03.860> seconds<00:05:04.250> get<00:05:04.460> a

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
at the end of the 52 seconds get a

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.570 
at the end of the 52 seconds get a
30-second<00:05:05.300> delay<00:05:05.390> that's<00:05:06.230> real<00:05:06.470> important<00:05:07.190> in

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
30-second delay that's real important in

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:09.220 
30-second delay that's real important in
environments<00:05:08.270> where<00:05:08.420> you<00:05:08.540> just<00:05:08.750> can't<00:05:08.930> have

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:09.230 
environments where you just can't have

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:11.530 
environments where you just can't have
that<00:05:09.440> sound<00:05:09.740> soak<00:05:10.100> for<00:05:10.310> too<00:05:10.520> long<00:05:10.700> but<00:05:11.270> let<00:05:11.450> me

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:11.540 
that sound soak for too long but let me

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.380 
that sound soak for too long but let me
scroll<00:05:11.930> through<00:05:12.290> and<00:05:12.770> get<00:05:13.010> back<00:05:13.280> to<00:05:13.670> sad

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:14.390 
scroll through and get back to sad

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:20.260 
scroll through and get back to sad
frenzy<00:05:18.040> and<00:05:19.040> give<00:05:19.370> you<00:05:19.460> an<00:05:19.640> example<00:05:19.940> of<00:05:20.210> the

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
frenzy and give you an example of the

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.330 
frenzy and give you an example of the
sound<00:05:20.570> once<00:05:21.140> you're<00:05:21.290> on<00:05:21.320> shad<00:05:21.680> frenzy<00:05:22.100> all<00:05:22.220> you

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:22.340 
sound once you're on shad frenzy all you

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.880 
sound once you're on shad frenzy all you
do<00:05:22.460> is<00:05:22.580> hit<00:05:22.730> play<00:05:23.000> and<00:05:23.270> then<00:05:23.860> choose<00:05:24.860> your

do is hit play and then choose your

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:27.190 
do is hit play and then choose your
volume<00:05:25.400> we<00:05:25.580> start<00:05:25.850> at<00:05:26.000> a<00:05:26.030> low<00:05:26.270> volume<00:05:26.300> so<00:05:27.140> you

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:27.200 
volume we start at a low volume so you

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.200 
volume we start at a low volume so you
don't<00:05:27.440> spook<00:05:27.740> anything<00:05:28.220> initially<00:05:28.760> starting

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210 
don't spook anything initially starting

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:34.740 
don't spook anything initially starting

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.480 
bass truly pickup lateral lines I'm
gonna<00:05:56.120> put<00:05:56.300> this<00:05:56.450> on<00:05:56.660> pause<00:05:56.950> so<00:05:57.950> I<00:05:58.010> can<00:05:58.160> explain

00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:58.490 
gonna put this on pause so I can explain

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:00.070 
gonna put this on pause so I can explain
the<00:05:58.670> speaker<00:05:59.000> when<00:05:59.360> we<00:05:59.510> built<00:05:59.720> the<00:05:59.840> speaker

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080 
the speaker when we built the speaker

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.230 
the speaker when we built the speaker
system<00:06:00.350> we<00:06:00.710> had<00:06:01.340> a<00:06:01.370> lot<00:06:01.580> of<00:06:01.610> things<00:06:01.910> in<00:06:02.060> mind

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:02.240 
system we had a lot of things in mind

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.390 
system we had a lot of things in mind
regarding<00:06:02.810> the<00:06:02.990> design<00:06:03.200> the<00:06:03.830> first<00:06:04.070> thing<00:06:04.250> we

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 
regarding the design the first thing we

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.810 
regarding the design the first thing we
had<00:06:04.550> in<00:06:04.730> mind<00:06:04.970> was<00:06:05.690> how<00:06:05.960> we<00:06:06.860> place<00:06:07.310> the<00:06:07.550> speaker

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:07.820 
had in mind was how we place the speaker

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:09.610 
had in mind was how we place the speaker
on<00:06:08.090> the<00:06:08.120> bottom<00:06:08.480> of<00:06:08.600> the<00:06:08.660> trolling<00:06:08.930> motor<00:06:09.020> it's

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:09.620 
on the bottom of the trolling motor it's

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.490 
on the bottom of the trolling motor it's
very<00:06:09.860> critical<00:06:10.130> that<00:06:10.750> we<00:06:11.750> had<00:06:12.290> the

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:12.500 
very critical that we had the

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.650 
very critical that we had the
omnidirectional<00:06:13.090> technology<00:06:14.090> of<00:06:14.210> how<00:06:14.420> this

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:14.660 
omnidirectional technology of how this

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.930 
omnidirectional technology of how this
speaker<00:06:14.990> produces<00:06:15.620> sound<00:06:15.890> we<00:06:16.430> couldn't<00:06:16.760> have

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:16.940

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:32.870 
sound the second thing we incorporated

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:33.490 
sound the second thing we incorporated
is

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:33.500 
is

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.030 
is
and<00:06:33.590> in<00:06:34.520> the<00:06:34.730> design<00:06:35.110> was<00:06:36.110> a<00:06:36.140> deflection<00:06:36.650> mount

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:37.040 
and in the design was a deflection mount

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.910 
and in the design was a deflection mount
the<00:06:37.790> speaker<00:06:38.210> is<00:06:38.330> very<00:06:38.750> very<00:06:39.110> rigid<00:06:39.380> in<00:06:39.680> my

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:39.920 
the speaker is very very rigid in my

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.410 
the speaker is very very rigid in my
opinion<00:06:40.340> I<00:06:40.430> think<00:06:40.640> you're<00:06:40.790> gonna<00:06:40.910> bend<00:06:41.270> your

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:41.420 
opinion I think you're gonna bend your

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:43.390 
opinion I think you're gonna bend your
troll<00:06:41.750> Muller<00:06:41.990> motor<00:06:42.410> shaft<00:06:42.680> before<00:06:43.190> you<00:06:43.280> ever

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:43.400 
troll Muller motor shaft before you ever

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.070 
troll Muller motor shaft before you ever
get<00:06:43.640> the<00:06:43.790> chance<00:06:44.060> of<00:06:44.180> breaking<00:06:44.540> this<00:06:44.630> speaker

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:45.080 
get the chance of breaking this speaker

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.440 
get the chance of breaking this speaker
but<00:06:45.530> we<00:06:45.680> made<00:06:45.830> it<00:06:45.980> a<00:06:46.040> very<00:06:46.250> very<00:06:46.520> rigid<00:06:46.850> object

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:47.450 
but we made it a very very rigid object

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:50.770 
but we made it a very very rigid object
and<00:06:47.600> we<00:06:47.690> made<00:06:47.870> it<00:06:48.020> also<00:06:48.820> in<00:06:49.820> innocent

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:50.780 
and we made it also in innocent

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:54.160 
and we made it also in innocent
I<00:06:50.810> guess<00:06:51.470> in<00:06:51.650> a<00:06:51.740> position<00:06:52.400> for<00:06:53.000> deflection<00:06:53.840> of

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:54.170 
I guess in a position for deflection of

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:56.110 
I guess in a position for deflection of
any<00:06:54.410> object<00:06:54.890> should<00:06:55.040> it<00:06:55.160> be<00:06:55.280> a<00:06:55.310> rock<00:06:55.610> or<00:06:55.910> tree

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:56.120 
any object should it be a rock or tree

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.860 
any object should it be a rock or tree
or<00:06:56.210> stomp<00:06:56.750> or<00:06:57.020> whatever<00:06:58.360> that's<00:06:59.360> a<00:06:59.600> speaker

00:06:59.860 --> 00:06:59.870 
or stomp or whatever that's a speaker

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:02.530 
or stomp or whatever that's a speaker
system<00:07:00.250> and<00:07:01.250> this<00:07:01.520> is<00:07:01.700> the<00:07:01.850> system<00:07:02.090> as<00:07:02.360> a<00:07:02.390> whole

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:02.540 
system and this is the system as a whole

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:04.510 
system and this is the system as a whole
now<00:07:03.170> I'll<00:07:03.230> show<00:07:03.470> you<00:07:03.530> something<00:07:03.830> else<00:07:04.130> that

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:04.520 
now I'll show you something else that

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:05.920 
now I'll show you something else that
was<00:07:04.610> kind<00:07:04.850> of<00:07:04.940> really<00:07:05.210> important<00:07:05.600> to<00:07:05.660> me<00:07:05.780> when

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:05.930 
was kind of really important to me when

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:07.540 
was kind of really important to me when
we're<00:07:06.110> designing<00:07:06.320> this<00:07:06.770> is<00:07:07.130> the<00:07:07.280> amount<00:07:07.430> of

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:07.550 
we're designing this is the amount of

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:10.750 
we're designing this is the amount of
power<00:07:07.850> that<00:07:08.030> the<00:07:08.330> unit<00:07:08.720> truly<00:07:09.290> needs<00:07:09.530> to<00:07:09.800> run<00:07:10.040> a

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:10.760 
power that the unit truly needs to run a

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.120 
power that the unit truly needs to run a
lot<00:07:11.450> of<00:07:11.570> our<00:07:11.690> graphs<00:07:11.990> today<00:07:12.320> take<00:07:12.710> a<00:07:12.740> lot<00:07:13.100> of

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:13.130 
lot of our graphs today take a lot of

power of our boat out of our boat this
does<00:07:15.470> not<00:07:15.620> this<00:07:16.220> is<00:07:16.370> a<00:07:16.400> simple<00:07:16.910> unit<00:07:17.210> and<00:07:17.360> it

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:17.480 
does not this is a simple unit and it

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.210 
does not this is a simple unit and it
doesn't<00:07:17.870> take<00:07:18.020> much<00:07:18.260> power<00:07:18.530> and<00:07:18.980> we

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:19.220 
doesn't take much power and we

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:21.670 
doesn't take much power and we
considered<00:07:19.700> even<00:07:20.330> ice<00:07:20.600> fishermen<00:07:21.200> when<00:07:21.560> we

00:07:21.670 --> 00:07:21.680 
considered even ice fishermen when we

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.130 
considered even ice fishermen when we
developed<00:07:22.160> it<00:07:22.310> in<00:07:22.400> the<00:07:22.520> ease<00:07:22.700> of<00:07:22.730> them<00:07:23.140> taking

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:24.140 
developed it in the ease of them taking

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:25.870 
developed it in the ease of them taking
it<00:07:24.260> out<00:07:24.410> on<00:07:24.440> the<00:07:24.740> ice<00:07:24.919> and<00:07:25.250> carrying<00:07:25.640> it<00:07:25.730> around

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:25.880 
it out on the ice and carrying it around

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:30.040 
it out on the ice and carrying it around
with<00:07:26.240> them<00:07:26.360> but<00:07:26.540> simply<00:07:26.720> under<00:07:27.470> here<00:07:27.680> I<00:07:28.960> have<00:07:29.960> a

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:30.050 
with them but simply under here I have a

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:33.850 
with them but simply under here I have a
six<00:07:30.350> bulb<00:07:31.450> lantern<00:07:32.450> battery<00:07:32.740> running<00:07:33.740> this

six bulb lantern battery running this

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:35.620 
six bulb lantern battery running this
thing<00:07:34.100> I've<00:07:34.280> been<00:07:34.460> running<00:07:34.850> it<00:07:35.000> now<00:07:35.030> for<00:07:35.210> two

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:35.630 
thing I've been running it now for two

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:36.070 
thing I've been running it now for two
weeks

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:36.080 
weeks

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.830 
weeks
giving<00:07:36.650> demos<00:07:37.040> and<00:07:37.490> it<00:07:37.610> hasn't<00:07:38.000> even<00:07:38.090> touched

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:38.840 
giving demos and it hasn't even touched

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:41.770 
giving demos and it hasn't even touched
the<00:07:39.500> capacity<00:07:40.130> of<00:07:40.250> this<00:07:40.430> battery<00:07:41.000> so<00:07:41.510> that<00:07:41.630> was

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:41.780 
the capacity of this battery so that was

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:44.100 
the capacity of this battery so that was
another<00:07:42.020> important<00:07:42.590> thing<00:07:42.710> but<00:07:43.190> essentially

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:44.110 
another important thing but essentially

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:46.450 
another important thing but essentially
that's<00:07:45.110> the<00:07:45.290> hydro<00:07:45.650> way<00:07:45.800> if<00:07:45.860> there's<00:07:46.130> one

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:46.460 
that's the hydro way if there's one

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:47.860 
that's the hydro way if there's one
other<00:07:46.640> thing<00:07:46.760> I<00:07:47.030> forgot<00:07:47.060> to<00:07:47.450> mention<00:07:47.570> that<00:07:47.810> I

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:47.870 
other thing I forgot to mention that I

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:49.270 
other thing I forgot to mention that I
wanna<00:07:48.110> mention<00:07:48.290> real<00:07:48.620> quick<00:07:48.800> because<00:07:48.860> we<00:07:49.100> do

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:49.280 
wanna mention real quick because we do

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:52.150 
wanna mention real quick because we do
have<00:07:49.430> a<00:07:49.490> footswitch<00:07:50.290> connection<00:07:51.290> here<00:07:51.530> so<00:07:52.100> if

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:52.160 
have a footswitch connection here so if

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:53.950 
have a footswitch connection here so if
you<00:07:52.280> want<00:07:52.490> to<00:07:52.550> instead<00:07:53.000> of<00:07:53.150> the<00:07:53.510> hit<00:07:53.690> pause

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:53.960 
you want to instead of the hit pause

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:57.460 
you want to instead of the hit pause
play<00:07:55.330> manually<00:07:56.330> with<00:07:56.570> your<00:07:56.600> finger<00:07:57.110> and<00:07:57.290> start

00:07:59.740 --> 00:07:59.750 
beginning again we have a foot switch

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:01.719 
beginning again we have a foot switch
that's<00:08:00.320> incorporated<00:08:00.650> so<00:08:01.130> if<00:08:01.220> you're<00:08:01.370> in<00:08:01.490> big

00:08:01.719 --> 00:08:01.729 
that's incorporated so if you're in big

00:08:01.729 --> 00:08:03.250 
that's incorporated so if you're in big
waves<00:08:02.060> and<00:08:02.419> you're<00:08:02.510> taking<00:08:02.840> them<00:08:02.960> over<00:08:03.169> the

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:03.260 
waves and you're taking them over the

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:04.630 
waves and you're taking them over the
bow<00:08:03.380> and<00:08:03.620> you<00:08:03.710> really<00:08:04.040> don't<00:08:04.340> have<00:08:04.490> the

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:04.640 
bow and you really don't have the

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.969 
bow and you really don't have the
opportunity<00:08:05.330> to<00:08:05.479> bend<00:08:06.080> down<00:08:06.290> and<00:08:06.350> turn<00:08:06.740> it<00:08:06.860> off

00:08:06.969 --> 00:08:06.979 
opportunity to bend down and turn it off

00:08:06.979 --> 00:08:09.310

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:09.320 
you can actually hit a foot switch but

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:12.340
