a good tape measurer can always use a
pin<00:02:09.709> permanent<00:02:10.709> marker<00:02:14.150> this<00:02:15.150> is<00:02:15.360> a<00:02:15.390> surf<00:02:16.230> form

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
pin permanent marker this is a surf form

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.940 
pin permanent marker this is a surf form
by<00:02:17.430> using<00:02:17.459> the<00:02:18.140> takedown<00:02:19.140> appendages<00:02:19.620> and

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
by using the takedown appendages and

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.390 
by using the takedown appendages and
straighten<00:02:20.519> them<00:02:20.700> out<00:02:21.290> it's<00:02:22.290> not<00:02:22.470> required

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
have the solder iron and probably use

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:52.100 
have the solder iron and probably use
that<00:02:44.459> instead<00:02:47.900> staple<00:02:48.900> gun<00:02:50.599> you<00:02:51.599> can<00:02:51.780> use<00:02:51.959> this

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
that instead staple gun you can use this

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.839 
that instead staple gun you can use this
to<00:02:52.170> secure<00:02:52.829> some<00:02:53.040> of<00:02:53.129> the<00:02:53.190> wires<00:02:53.430> with<00:02:53.700> in

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
to secure some of the wires with in

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:56.449 
to secure some of the wires with in
there<00:02:54.410> it's<00:02:55.410> really<00:02:55.709> good<00:02:55.860> if<00:02:56.010> your<00:02:56.129> staple

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
there it's really good if your staple

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.690 
there it's really good if your staple
gun<00:02:56.579> will<00:02:56.760> take<00:02:57.560> staples<00:02:58.560> for<00:02:59.160> wires

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
gun will take staples for wires

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.449 
gun will take staples for wires
specifically<00:03:00.480> they've<00:03:00.660> got<00:03:00.840> a<00:03:00.870> rounded<00:03:01.459> side

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
specifically they've got a rounded side

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:09.280 
specifically they've got a rounded side
to<00:03:02.730> them<00:03:02.879> so<00:03:03.540> that<00:03:03.569> they<00:03:03.750> don't<00:03:03.840> cut<00:03:04.769> the<00:03:04.890> wires

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.180 

you<00:03:10.290> can<00:03:10.440> use<00:03:10.620> a<00:03:10.650> circular<00:03:10.950> saw<00:03:12.560> I'm<00:03:13.560> not<00:03:13.920> going

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
you can use a circular saw I'm not going

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.970 
you can use a circular saw I'm not going
to<00:03:14.340> right<00:03:14.579> now<00:03:15.049> okay<00:03:16.049> now<00:03:16.260> we're<00:03:16.470> going<00:03:16.530> to<00:03:16.620> be
