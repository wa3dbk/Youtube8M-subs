00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.400
 silver- roman ibero whose primitive 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:17.980
 name of argentaría was turned into 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.590
 Argentina for the native pronunciation 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:24.369
 during the low empire preserved by 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:26.619
 Mozarabs as they would teira and 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:29.470
 finally transformed into the allianz 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:32.140
 medieval teira that would end up giving 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.570
 current place name owes its denomination to 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.540
 the abundance of argentiferous mineral that 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.980
 there was always in his municipality his own 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.620
 madoff gave an account of it in his 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.810
 geographical dictionary says that in 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.970
 the time of the Moors were exploited in 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:48.090
 this land many and abundant mines 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.710
 of iron 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.420
 although it has been claimed that for being 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.580
 away from the main roads of 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.830
 communication the locality of lanteira 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:58.530
 never had importance in the time 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:01:00.780
 andalusí the archaeological remains that of 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.199
 they are preserved they deny this 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.119
 theory with rotundity to start are 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.940
 two the medieval castles that the 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.979
 they defended something very unlikely if they 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.080
 I would have tried a simple refuge 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.840
 nazarí like some little historian 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.580
 documented will come to imply the 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.290
 first of them located in front of the 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.750
 village and next to a ravine that more 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.630
 down will become river is found 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.830
 currently completely ruined 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.350
 keeping only in conditions 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.290
 medium acceptable a rectangular cistern 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.970
 in the highest part of the deposit 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.040
 whose work betrays the Nasrid hand in his 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.830
 construction although they have also 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.690
 appeared objects and ceramics pre califal 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.420
 according to Professor Antonio 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:46.000
 malpica would be on this platform where 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.160
 was located the defensive bastion of 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.400
 that are still visible many remains of 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.290
 walls and the drawing of some tower although 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.900
 it is a space of reduced 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.090
 dimensions around stretched to 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.220
 a kind of village that is left 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.410
 also remains of walls and fragments 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.990
 of tile as well as abundant slag 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:07.510
 from the metal casting 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.320
 which makes associate this settlement to the 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.320
 metallurgical activity 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.400
 the second plant strength 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.099

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.769
 of the current municipal cemetery and being 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:22.510
 Easier to access than the previous one 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:25.239
 she is also more grateful for her 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:28.409
 observation by keeping large standing 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:30.670
 canvases of wall and part of its towers 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:32.590
 so much for its characteristics 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.840
 constructive as for the ceramics 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.610
 found in its enclosure can be affirmed 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.239
 that it is a work typically 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.239
 Nasrid 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.340
