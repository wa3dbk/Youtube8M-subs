900 now first thing you'll notice once
we<00:00:45.270> get<00:00:45.390> into<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.810> benchmark<00:00:46.560> running<00:00:46.950> itself

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:47.220 
we get into the benchmark running itself

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.250 
we get into the benchmark running itself
is<00:00:47.460> that<00:00:48.030> these<00:00:48.420> schemes<00:00:48.630> of<00:00:48.810> the<00:00:48.870> characters

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
is that these schemes of the characters

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.200 
is that these schemes of the characters
are<00:00:49.380> not<00:00:49.470> the<00:00:49.590> same<00:00:49.739> basically<00:00:50.280> I<00:00:50.430> went<00:00:50.970> and

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
are not the same basically I went and

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.150 
are not the same basically I went and
downloaded<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.810> whole<00:00:51.900> bunch<00:00:52.079> of<00:00:52.170> skins<00:00:52.560> so<00:00:53.130> I

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
downloaded a whole bunch of skins so I

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.920 
downloaded a whole bunch of skins so I
apologize<00:00:53.670> for<00:00:53.850> that<00:00:53.910> then<00:00:54.390> had<00:00:54.540> the<00:00:54.630> time<00:00:54.780> to

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
apologize for that then had the time to

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.800 
apologize for that then had the time to
remove<00:00:55.140> those<00:00:55.350> skins<00:00:56.239> so<00:00:57.239> this<00:00:57.480> is<00:00:57.600> when<00:00:57.720> you

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:57.810 
remove those skins so this is when you

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.740 
remove those skins so this is when you

this<00:01:13.920> is<00:01:14.069> using<00:01:14.219> the<00:01:14.429> same<00:01:14.579> demo<00:01:14.819> file<00:01:14.999> I've

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:15.149 
this is using the same demo file I've

this is using the same demo file I've
used<00:01:15.359> previously<00:01:15.569> so<00:01:16.109> you<00:01:16.200> can<00:01:16.350> also

00:01:16.489 --> 00:01:16.499 
used previously so you can also

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:18.980 
used previously so you can also
reference<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.520> Nvidia<00:01:18.119> video<00:01:18.299> that<00:01:18.600> I<00:01:18.630> used

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
reference the Nvidia video that I used

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.840

with<00:01:19.679> this<00:01:19.889> demo<00:01:20.100> file<00:01:20.369> if<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:20.670> were

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
with this demo file if you were

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.459 
with this demo file if you were
interested<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.569> see<00:01:21.749> the<00:01:21.899> difference<00:01:22.200> between

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:22.469 
interested to see the difference between

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:25.160 
interested to see the difference between
performance<00:01:22.649> of<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.189> two<00:01:23.399> graphics<00:01:24.060> cards<00:01:24.389> do

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
performance of the two graphics cards do

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.690 
performance of the two graphics cards do
note<00:01:25.380> though<00:01:25.560> that<00:01:25.590> that<00:01:25.950> previous<00:01:26.340> video<00:01:26.490> is

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
note though that that previous video is

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.340 
note though that that previous video is
1080p<00:01:27.090> while<00:01:27.359> this<00:01:27.509> video<00:01:27.659> I'm<00:01:27.959> running<00:01:28.229> this

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
1080p while this video I'm running this

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:35.599 
1080p while this video I'm running this
game<00:01:28.619> this<00:01:29.310> game<00:01:29.459> at<00:01:29.759> 1600<00:01:30.450> by<00:01:30.569> 900<00:01:34.340> so<00:01:35.340> this<00:01:35.490> is

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:35.609 
game this game at 1600 by 900 so this is

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:40.039 
game this game at 1600 by 900 so this is
running<00:01:35.759> on<00:01:35.969> a<00:01:35.999> desktop<00:01:36.600> system<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:39.049> I

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
running on a desktop system and I

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.980 
running on a desktop system and I
believe<00:01:40.490> this<00:01:41.490> ink<00:01:41.729> is<00:01:41.880> disabled<00:01:42.479> yes<00:01:42.659> it<00:01:42.840> is

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
believe this ink is disabled yes it is

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.139 
believe this ink is disabled yes it is
it<00:01:43.229> is<00:01:43.469> indeed

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
it is indeed

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:46.429 
it is indeed
alright<00:01:45.149> so<00:01:45.299> we're<00:01:45.450> starting<00:01:45.630> off<00:01:45.899> both

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
alright so we're starting off both

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.410 
alright so we're starting off both
systems<00:01:46.950> above

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
systems above

at<00:02:09.690> 140<00:02:10.640> we<00:02:11.640> are<00:02:11.730> seeing<00:02:11.970> drops<00:02:12.270> on<00:02:12.450> both

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
at 140 we are seeing drops on both

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.600 
at 140 we are seeing drops on both
systems<00:02:13.020> but<00:02:13.170> just<00:02:13.709> slightly<00:02:14.010> at<00:02:14.280> different

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.850 
systems but just slightly at different
times<00:02:14.880> so<00:02:17.030> far<00:02:18.030> either<00:02:18.720> interface<00:02:19.560> is<00:02:19.680> not

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.490 
times so far either interface is not
playing<00:02:20.099> a<00:02:20.220> very<00:02:20.400> big<00:02:20.610> role<00:02:20.819> in<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.450> drops<00:02:21.959> or

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
playing a very big role in the drops or

performance<00:02:23.190> gains<00:02:23.459> both<00:02:23.880> are<00:02:24.120> dropping

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
performance gains both are dropping

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.650 
performance gains both are dropping
let's<00:02:26.610> drop<00:02:26.790> we've<00:02:27.090> seen<00:02:27.269> the<00:02:27.360> drop<00:02:27.540> at

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
let's drop we've seen the drop at

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.390 
let's drop we've seen the drop at
different<00:02:27.930> times<00:02:28.080> of<00:02:28.230> when<00:02:28.350> to<00:02:28.470> drop<00:02:28.650> down<00:02:28.769> 64

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
different times of when to drop down 64

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.259 
moment excessive 30 per second there one
thing<00:02:34.470> I<00:02:34.560> noted<00:02:35.010> with<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.549> catalyst<00:02:36.000> driver

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
thing I noted with the catalyst driver

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:37.729 
thing I noted with the catalyst driver
as<00:02:36.480> you<00:02:36.569> can<00:02:36.720> see<00:02:36.900> here<00:02:37.140> is<00:02:37.260> that<00:02:37.290> there<00:02:37.620> is

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
as you can see here is that there is

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.660 
as you can see here is that there is
huge<00:02:38.069> stutter<00:02:38.489> in<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:38.730> beginning<00:02:39.090> of<00:02:39.180> this

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
huge stutter in the beginning of this

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.030 
huge stutter in the beginning of this
level<00:02:41.670> for<00:02:41.970> some<00:02:42.150> reason<00:02:42.540> lags<00:02:43.319> for<00:02:43.709> moment

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
happen with the Nvidia cards don't know

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.309 
happen with the Nvidia cards don't know
why<00:02:48.150> looks<00:02:48.989> like<00:02:49.140> it's<00:02:49.290> a<00:02:49.350> catalyst<00:02:49.739> problem

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
why looks like it's a catalyst problem

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:54.050 
why looks like it's a catalyst problem
so<00:02:52.319> so<00:02:52.590> far<00:02:52.799> the<00:02:53.010> lowest<00:02:53.160> we've<00:02:53.489> seen<00:02:53.670> it<00:02:53.760> drop

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
so so far the lowest we've seen it drop

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.240 
so so far the lowest we've seen it drop
was<00:02:54.299> for<00:02:54.570> a<00:02:54.600> moment<00:02:55.019> at<00:02:55.140> 30<00:02:55.470> frames<00:02:55.620> per<00:02:55.799> second

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
was for a moment at 30 frames per second

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.280 
was for a moment at 30 frames per second

when<00:03:02.220> this<00:03:02.340> heavy<00:03:02.549> part<00:03:02.880> here<00:03:03.060> we<00:03:03.209> see<00:03:03.390> dropped

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
when this heavy part here we see dropped

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.060 
when this heavy part here we see dropped
about<00:03:03.930> fifty<00:03:04.320> sixteen<00:03:04.739> back<00:03:05.070> up<00:03:05.250> to<00:03:06.200> 180<00:03:07.200> to

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
about fifty sixteen back up to 180 to

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.740 
about fifty sixteen back up to 180 to
190<00:03:09.680> seven<00:03:10.680> seventeen<00:03:11.579> it's<00:03:12.420> looking

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
190 seven seventeen it's looking

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.360 
190 seven seventeen it's looking
relatively<00:03:13.320> the<00:03:13.350> same<00:03:13.470> here<00:03:13.920> I'm<00:03:14.070> not<00:03:14.220> really

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
relatively the same here I'm not really

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.390 
relatively the same here I'm not really
seeing<00:03:15.049> large<00:03:16.049> performance<00:03:16.829> increased<00:03:17.100> with

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
seeing large performance increased with

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.360 
seeing large performance increased with
xfce<00:03:18.560> so<00:03:19.560> if<00:03:19.680> you're<00:03:19.829> thinking<00:03:19.950> you're<00:03:20.250> going

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
xfce so if you're thinking you're going

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:21.979 
xfce so if you're thinking you're going
to<00:03:20.489> get<00:03:20.579> a<00:03:20.609> boost<00:03:20.850> with<00:03:21.120> it<00:03:21.239> it<00:03:21.359> doesn't<00:03:21.630> seem

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
to get a boost with it it doesn't seem

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.940 
to get a boost with it it doesn't seem
so<00:03:22.260> yet<00:03:23.120> alright<00:03:24.180> most<00:03:25.109> either<00:03:25.590> one<00:03:25.920> just

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
so yet alright most either one just

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.630 
so yet alright most either one just
drops<00:03:26.280> at<00:03:26.489> a<00:03:26.519> different<00:03:26.910> time

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
drops at a different time

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.729 
drops at a different time
still<00:03:29.640> watching<00:03:29.820> both<00:03:30.269> they<00:03:30.870> look<00:03:31.079> relatively

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
still watching both they look relatively

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.130 
still watching both they look relatively
similar<00:03:32.269> but<00:03:33.269> then<00:03:33.480> again<00:03:33.569> this<00:03:33.780> video<00:03:33.959> is

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
similar but then again this video is

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.780 
similar but then again this video is
here<00:03:34.440> for<00:03:34.650> you<00:03:34.829> to<00:03:34.859> take<00:03:35.160> a<00:03:35.190> look<00:03:35.400> at<00:03:35.489> yourself

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
here for you to take a look at yourself

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.069 
here for you to take a look at yourself
if<00:03:35.910> you're<00:03:36.060> not<00:03:36.090> just<00:03:36.450> and<00:03:36.600> listen<00:03:36.840> to<00:03:36.989> my

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:37.079 
if you're not just and listen to my

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:38.569 
if you're not just and listen to my
commentary<00:03:37.650> you<00:03:37.709> can<00:03:37.890> mute<00:03:38.010> it<00:03:38.190> and<00:03:38.280> then<00:03:38.430> look

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
commentary you can mute it and then look

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:42.600 
commentary you can mute it and then look
at<00:03:38.640> the<00:03:38.760> numbers<00:03:39.060> for<00:03:39.269> yourself

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.190 

both<00:03:43.610> still<00:03:44.000> at<00:03:44.150> about<00:03:44.360> a<00:03:44.390> hundred<00:03:44.600> frames<00:03:44.900> per

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
both still at about a hundred frames per

both still at about a hundred frames per

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.120 
it ever drops below thirty that's when
