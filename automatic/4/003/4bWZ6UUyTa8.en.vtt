00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
you go up and do this and it kind of

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.460 
you go up and do this and it kind of
gives<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:12.000> effect<00:02:12.090> that<00:02:12.570> it's<00:02:13.140> a<00:02:13.260> really

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
gives the effect that it's a really

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.750 
gives the effect that it's a really
really<00:02:13.950> kind<00:02:14.640> of<00:02:14.760> pleated<00:02:15.630> ish<00:02:15.830> dress<00:02:16.830> that

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
does that make sense I'm kind of going

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.259 
does that make sense I'm kind of going
for<00:02:22.080> a<00:02:22.110> memory<00:02:22.590> here<00:02:22.950> if<00:02:23.220> what<00:02:23.430> mycoses<00:02:23.910> dress

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269

for a memory here if what mycoses dress
looks<00:02:24.540> like<00:02:24.780> so<00:02:25.560> it's<00:02:25.680> not<00:02:25.799> going<00:02:26.010> to<00:02:26.160> look<00:02:26.420> the

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
looks like so it's not going to look the

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:33.520 
looks like so it's not going to look the
same

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530

that and that looks really cute but if

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.670 
that and that looks really cute but if
you<00:03:32.250> want<00:03:32.459> you<00:03:32.670> can<00:03:32.940> do<00:03:33.090> this<00:03:33.350> which<00:03:34.350> kind<00:03:34.590> of

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
you want you can do this which kind of

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.100 
you want you can do this which kind of
gives<00:03:35.040> it<00:03:35.160> more<00:03:35.370> realistic<00:03:35.730> kind<00:03:36.450> of<00:03:36.890> effect
