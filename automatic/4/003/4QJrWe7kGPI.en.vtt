00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.939
 but of course a very powerful taboo taboo 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:36.180
 a very powerful taboo because of course 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:39.250
 human being is not the end of life 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:43.589
 civilized civilization very much fears the 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.589
 death is a terror 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:54.720
 superstitious because of the suspicion of 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.760
 to be in it up to your neck because you fear 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:00.030
 life in reality with a big pole 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.610
 of life and knows that the fear of life 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:08.030
 it is a search for refuge in forms of death 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:10.040
 there are so many there are so many ways to 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.320
 kill yourself in agony 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.810
 there is a very nice Russian tale 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:20.550
 we are the sofas of the icers who die 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:22.020
 story of an investigating judge who did 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.710
 he gets sick that he has a long and terrible one 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.300
 agony 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:30.330
 but why a kidney disease that does 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:33.210
 very bad and desperate because all 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.460
 his life turns out to be destroyed by a 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.700
 kidney problem that those who lead it 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.850
 very quickly towards the end given up 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.979
 absurd and absurd in the last moment 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.320
 he realizes that his whole life is 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.080
 it was false that everything was wrong 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.790
 how he always lied to you 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.190
 always done differently from how 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:57.690
 he thought in that instant he discovers 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:02:00.630
 be who he really is and the true storyteller 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:03.750
 story says the life of hands was there 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.450
 just that instant from there on 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.810
 an infinite life began for the 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.370
 distant was endless endless evening 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.230
 all that in the life of menelik 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.860
 preceded that instant was his 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:22.040
 death so you have to be very careful 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:24.299
 because it is very easy to be dead 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.730
 think that waiting for them at the end of 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:29.180
 life and worry about what 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.320
 will happen after a way actually 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.180
 to calm down and to forget that 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.160
 an object inside up the neck 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.830
 if you are not careful in the likeness of 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.780
 so many other people around you 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:42.080
 that seem alive but 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.080
 not only
