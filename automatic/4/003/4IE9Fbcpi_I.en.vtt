style so they may add a little bit or
take<00:02:20.020> away<00:02:20.170> from<00:02:20.350> it<00:02:20.709> not<00:02:20.920> the<00:02:21.100> substance<00:02:21.400> of

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
take away from it not the substance of

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.059 
take away from it not the substance of
the<00:02:21.850> story<00:02:21.880> but<00:02:22.660> stylistically<00:02:23.440> there<00:02:23.890> may<00:02:24.040> be

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
the story but stylistically there may be

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:25.650 
the story but stylistically there may be
some<00:02:24.370> differences<00:02:24.850> and<00:02:25.030> yes<00:02:25.150> we<00:02:25.330> do<00:02:25.450> have<00:02:25.480> a

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
some differences and yes we do have a

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.210 
some differences and yes we do have a
laugh<00:02:25.870> every<00:02:26.170> now<00:02:26.290> and<00:02:26.440> then<00:02:26.500> when<00:02:26.980> it<00:02:27.100> is

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
laugh every now and then when it is

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.670 
laugh every now and then when it is
appropriate<00:02:27.820> on<00:02:27.940> a<00:02:28.030> program<00:02:28.780> so<00:02:28.989> perhaps<00:02:29.440> that

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
appropriate on a program so perhaps that

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.130 
appropriate on a program so perhaps that
is<00:02:30.040> what<00:02:30.250> you<00:02:30.370> may<00:02:30.489> interpret<00:02:30.850> as<00:02:31.150> you<00:02:32.019> know

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
is what you may interpret as you know

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.170 
is what you may interpret as you know
almost<00:02:32.470> joking<00:02:33.190> but<00:02:33.310> if<00:02:33.580> it's<00:02:33.850> a<00:02:33.910> serious

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
almost joking but if it's a serious

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.120 
almost joking but if it's a serious
story<00:02:34.510> I<00:02:34.630> can<00:02:34.930> guarantee<00:02:35.380> you<00:02:35.650> we<00:02:35.800> take<00:02:35.980> it

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
story I can guarantee you we take it

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:48.729 
story I can guarantee you we take it
very<00:02:36.160> seriously

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.640 

well<00:02:49.739> great<00:02:50.280> question<00:02:50.700> I<00:02:51.180> think<00:02:51.989> I've

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
well great question I think I've

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.979 
well great question I think I've
developed<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.489> skill<00:02:53.849> that<00:02:54.360> I<00:02:54.420> think<00:02:54.840> many

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
developed the skill that I think many

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.430 
developed the skill that I think many
presenters<00:02:55.470> have<00:02:55.709> developed<00:02:56.489> as<00:02:56.610> well<00:02:56.760> of

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
presenters have developed as well of

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.780 
presenters have developed as well of
compartmentalizing<00:02:58.440> I<00:02:58.830> mean<00:02:59.040> when<00:02:59.580> it's<00:02:59.730> a

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
compartmentalizing I mean when it's a

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.330 
compartmentalizing I mean when it's a
serious<00:02:59.970> issue<00:03:00.269> you<00:03:00.840> need<00:03:00.959> to<00:03:01.140> focus<00:03:01.379> address

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
serious issue you need to focus address

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.330 
serious issue you need to focus address
that<00:03:02.580> get<00:03:03.150> it<00:03:03.269> on<00:03:03.420> air<00:03:03.690> tell<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.230> story<00:03:04.650> get

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
that get it on air tell the story get

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.580 
that get it on air tell the story get
people<00:03:05.670> to<00:03:05.790> draw<00:03:05.970> their<00:03:06.180> own<00:03:06.260> conclusions<00:03:07.260> if

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
people to draw their own conclusions if

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.229 
people to draw their own conclusions if
it's<00:03:07.800> a<00:03:07.890> light-hearted<00:03:08.099> story<00:03:08.730> we'll<00:03:09.030> present

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
it's a light-hearted story we'll present

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.870 
it's a light-hearted story we'll present
it<00:03:09.540> as<00:03:09.720> such<00:03:10.349> but<00:03:10.890> in<00:03:11.040> terms<00:03:11.280> of<00:03:11.430> making<00:03:11.640> a

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
it as such but in terms of making a

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.460 
it as such but in terms of making a
sudden<00:03:12.209> switch<00:03:12.510> I<00:03:12.660> think<00:03:12.840> we're<00:03:12.989> always<00:03:13.140> very

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
sudden switch I think we're always very

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.949 
sudden switch I think we're always very
cautious<00:03:13.739> not<00:03:14.400> to<00:03:14.459> place<00:03:15.150> a<00:03:15.180> very<00:03:15.480> serious

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
cautious not to place a very serious

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:17.750 
cautious not to place a very serious
story<00:03:16.260> next<00:03:16.680> to<00:03:16.860> one<00:03:17.040> that<00:03:17.190> is<00:03:17.250> rather

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
story next to one that is rather

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:18.500 
story next to one that is rather
humorous

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
humorous

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.030 
humorous
I<00:03:18.540> think<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:19.019> serious<00:03:19.319> issues<00:03:19.680> need<00:03:19.920> to<00:03:19.950> be

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
I think the serious issues need to be

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.190 
I think the serious issues need to be
addressed<00:03:20.519> as<00:03:20.700> such<00:03:20.849> and<00:03:21.090> be<00:03:21.209> respected<00:03:22.080> in

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
addressed as such and be respected in

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.839 
addressed as such and be respected in
their<00:03:22.349> own<00:03:22.560> right<00:03:22.799> and<00:03:23.040> because<00:03:23.549> there's<00:03:23.730> so

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:23.849 
their own right and because there's so

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:25.759 
their own right and because there's so
much<00:03:23.970> emotion<00:03:24.480> involved<00:03:24.780> for<00:03:25.140> some<00:03:25.500> who<00:03:25.650> may

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
much emotion involved for some who may

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.250 
much emotion involved for some who may
be<00:03:25.830> watching<00:03:26.160> you<00:03:26.819> want<00:03:27.090> to<00:03:27.209> present<00:03:27.420> it<00:03:27.750> you

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
be watching you want to present it you

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.380 
be watching you want to present it you
know<00:03:28.410> with<00:03:28.590> a<00:03:28.620> degree<00:03:29.190> of<00:03:29.239> gravitas<00:03:30.239> and

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
know with a degree of gravitas and

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.690 
know with a degree of gravitas and
sobriety<00:03:30.780> so<00:03:31.470> yes

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
sobriety so yes

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.819 
sobriety so yes
sometimes<00:03:33.480> you<00:03:33.690> got<00:03:33.840> to<00:03:33.959> make<00:03:34.140> a<00:03:34.170> difficult

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
sometimes you got to make a difficult

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:38.120 
sometimes you got to make a difficult
transition<00:03:35.280> but<00:03:36.150> I<00:03:36.450> think<00:03:36.989> we<00:03:37.530> just<00:03:37.860> try<00:03:38.069> and

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
transition but I think we just try and

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.830 
transition but I think we just try and
be<00:03:38.250> as<00:03:38.340> professional<00:03:38.670> as<00:03:38.940> possible<00:03:39.450> when

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
be as professional as possible when

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:49.640 
be as professional as possible when
doing<00:03:40.349> those<00:03:40.500> programs

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.680 

very<00:03:50.650> interesting<00:03:51.190> question<00:03:51.370> I<00:03:51.730> think<00:03:51.819> the

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
very interesting question I think the

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.180 
very interesting question I think the
role<00:03:52.900> of<00:03:52.930> journalists<00:03:53.560> especially<00:03:53.709> on<00:03:54.099> the

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
role of journalists especially on the

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.030 
role of journalists especially on the
continent<00:03:54.730> is<00:03:54.910> to<00:03:55.390> report<00:03:55.989> accurately<00:03:56.290> to

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
continent is to report accurately to

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.920 
continent is to report accurately to
tell<00:03:57.250> the<00:03:57.430> truth<00:03:57.700> and<00:03:57.879> to<00:03:57.970> cover<00:03:58.150> the<00:03:58.390> stories

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
tell the truth and to cover the stories

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.710 
tell the truth and to cover the stories
that<00:03:59.110> are<00:03:59.349> not<00:03:59.590> on<00:04:00.160> the<00:04:00.640> beaten<00:04:01.000> path<00:04:01.030> I<00:04:01.569> mean

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
that are not on the beaten path I mean

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.020 
that are not on the beaten path I mean
there's<00:04:01.930> so<00:04:02.140> many<00:04:02.290> issues<00:04:02.620> out<00:04:02.769> there<00:04:02.890> on<00:04:03.790> the

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
there's so many issues out there on the

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.339 
there's so many issues out there on the
continent<00:04:04.450> that<00:04:04.480> need<00:04:04.810> to<00:04:04.959> be<00:04:04.989> addressed

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:05.349 
continent that need to be addressed

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:06.870 
continent that need to be addressed
whether<00:04:05.709> it's<00:04:05.860> Ghana<00:04:06.099> Nigeria

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
whether it's Ghana Nigeria

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.780 
whether it's Ghana Nigeria
Zambia<00:04:07.540> or<00:04:07.780> Malawi<00:04:08.500> and<00:04:08.830> I<00:04:08.890> think<00:04:09.099> journalists

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
Zambia or Malawi and I think journalists

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.120 
Zambia or Malawi and I think journalists
have<00:04:09.910> a<00:04:09.959> responsibility<00:04:10.959> to<00:04:11.140> be<00:04:11.170> objective<00:04:11.920> to

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
have a responsibility to be objective to

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:13.470 
have a responsibility to be objective to
hold<00:04:12.340> their<00:04:12.730> governments<00:04:13.239> to<00:04:13.330> account

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
hold their governments to account

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.780 
hold their governments to account
because<00:04:14.110> to<00:04:14.470> a<00:04:14.500> large<00:04:14.709> extent<00:04:15.130> they<00:04:15.340> are<00:04:15.519> the

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
because to a large extent they are the

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.360 
because to a large extent they are the
voice<00:04:16.030> if<00:04:16.359> you<00:04:16.600> like<00:04:16.959> of<00:04:17.200> ordinary<00:04:17.859> people<00:04:18.250> who

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
voice if you like of ordinary people who

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.759 
voice if you like of ordinary people who
may<00:04:18.519> not<00:04:18.729> in<00:04:18.940> some<00:04:19.389> cases<00:04:19.630> be<00:04:19.989> able<00:04:20.290> to<00:04:20.410> express

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
may not in some cases be able to express

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.010 
may not in some cases be able to express
themselves<00:04:21.370> so<00:04:21.850> I<00:04:22.090> think<00:04:22.510> the<00:04:22.600> best<00:04:22.780> they<00:04:22.960> can

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
themselves so I think the best they can

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.560
