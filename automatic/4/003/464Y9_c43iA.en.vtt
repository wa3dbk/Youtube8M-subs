00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.180
 hello guys I'm henna wine motorcycle for 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.070
 nothing good cosplay today I bring you a 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:14.340
 tutorial that you will like much we 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.859
 to learn not one way but two to 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.019
 make feathers like maeva is a technique 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:24.370
 very simple that surely will be 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:27.250
 very useful so let's see the materials 

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:30.550
 to begin with we will need a piece of 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:33.190
 rubber eva and a marker first 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.960
 we draw the shape of a pen in a 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.500
 piece of eva rubber with the help of a 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.500
 black marker 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.500
 Y 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:48.470
 then we add a horizontal line and 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.470
 some details 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.390
 then we cut with the help of some 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.390
 scissors 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.390
 the 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.420
 and 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.970
 when we have it ready with the help of a 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.380
 toothpick 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:18.790
 we outlined the signs we had 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.790
 marked initially 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.359
 and 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.820
 and 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.170
 then with the help of scissors 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.800
 we will cut small triangles in the 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.800
 outside part 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.410
 nothing 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.569
 now to make our next pen 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:23.489
 We will do the same in pieces of rubber eva 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.489
 we will draw the shape of a pen 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.570
 we cut them 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:44.660
 and on this occasion 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.660
 with help of 3d paint 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:52.600
 first trying on a piece we will do the 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.600
 center of the pen 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:03:01.140
 now with the help of a welder or with a 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:01.140
 fine wood carver 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:10.180
 let's do the details as we can 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.180
 see in this pen already finished 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.940
 now we will proceed to paint we put a 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:23.610
 paper on the table so as not to stain the 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:26.170
 we will use water color tempera paints 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:30.700
 black and white you can also use 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:32.590
 Acrylics with the paint you want 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.870
 first in the pens that we made of 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.140
 blue color we will give you a base layer 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.140
 black 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:45.260
 once we have it 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:47.650
 over we will apply a layer of color 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.650
 White 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.200
 i 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:19.320
 using pointed stick 

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:22.320
 again the areas that have remained 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:26.090
 covered by white paint to 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.090
 make the black appear 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:44.490
 once dry we return to paint with 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:47.810
 we add little details so that 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.810
 look like a real pen 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:14.080
 with the white feather we will do the same 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:14.080
 but without using black paint 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:25.090
 and we paint it completely color 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.090
 White 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:32.300
 and we add little details to make it look 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.300
 a real feather 

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:38.270
 and more or less that would be our pen 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:40.699
