00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
be because I guess I didn't think over

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.860 
be because I guess I didn't think over

like<00:02:48.870> this<00:02:49.080> and<00:02:49.940> if<00:02:50.940> you<00:02:51.180> want<00:02:51.390> to<00:02:51.540> you<00:02:51.959> can<00:02:52.110> use

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
like this and if you want to you can use

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.130

00:04:58.939 --> 00:04:58.949 
right first but it's always a good idea

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:01.070 
right first but it's always a good idea
to<00:04:59.250> do<00:04:59.580> the<00:04:59.699> opposite<00:05:00.270> first<00:05:00.539> which<00:05:00.870> of<00:05:01.050> course

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
to do the opposite first which of course

to do the opposite first which of course
I<00:05:01.470> didn't<00:05:01.770> do<00:05:01.889> and<00:05:02.490> don't<00:05:02.880> know<00:05:03.090> I<00:05:03.120> think<00:05:03.300> so

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
I didn't do and don't know I think so

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.969 
I didn't do and don't know I think so
but<00:05:04.080> um<00:05:04.860> just<00:05:05.820> use<00:05:06.210> like<00:05:06.539> if<00:05:06.900> you<00:05:07.530> paint<00:05:07.800> it

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:07.979 
but um just use like if you paint it

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:09.800 
but um just use like if you paint it
like<00:05:08.009> this<00:05:08.400> without<00:05:08.910> those<00:05:09.270> other<00:05:09.509> nails

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
like this without those other nails

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.480 
like this without those other nails
being<00:05:10.080> white<00:05:10.320> will<00:05:10.500> make<00:05:10.650> it<00:05:10.770> a<00:05:10.830> ton<00:05:11.130> easier

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
being white will make it a ton easier

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:17.990 
being white will make it a ton easier
and<00:05:12.270> if<00:05:13.020> you<00:05:13.169> do<00:05:13.349> this<00:05:14.900> after<00:05:16.250> like<00:05:17.250> and<00:05:17.490> then

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
and if you do this after like and then

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.070 
and if you do this after like and then
do<00:05:18.210> this<00:05:18.660> one<00:05:18.900> after<00:05:19.410> after<00:05:19.800> it's<00:05:20.190> a<00:05:20.539> great<00:05:21.539> try

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
do this one after after it's a great try

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:32.399 
do this one after after it's a great try
a<00:05:22.110> little<00:05:22.410> bit<00:05:22.620> and<00:05:23.370> that'll<00:05:23.820> be<00:05:24.000> good

00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:32.409 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:34.469
