00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
actually slide it over a hook at this

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.339 
actually slide it over a hook at this
point<00:02:59.300> you're<00:02:59.390> actually<00:02:59.660> don't<00:02:59.840> want<00:02:59.930> to<00:02:59.989> fray

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
okay so go ahead and split this in half

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:34.490 
okay so go ahead and split this in half
half<00:03:26.470> on<00:03:26.680> one<00:03:26.890> side<00:03:27.159> half<00:03:27.549> on<00:03:27.730> the<00:03:27.879> other

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
and once you got that squared away you

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.940 
and once you got that squared away you
