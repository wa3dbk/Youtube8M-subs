00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.950
 You told me that I would lose my innocence. I 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:25.190
 I didn't think you meant 1 look in 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:27.740

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.689

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.400

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:49.400

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:53.030

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:55.070
 cattle and my silly heys like 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.740
 of the lost ark is a child from steven 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.720
 Spielberg and George Lucas are the two most 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:03.830
 talented producers of our generation 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:05.630
 before him video 36 times except for scenes with a snake 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.549
 poison down your face 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.360
 I can see them only when the light 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:12.080
 so let's surprise me find problems 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:17.259
 in the plot 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:20.119
 so we learned let it droop gone 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:22.700
 indiana johnes play no part in 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.560
 the outcome of the events of the films and if it were to 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.189
 he was not all asshole left without 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.710
 changes in what you do a little bit 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:33.880
 confused and Diana Jones from this to 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:36.579
 hat and split stand 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.799
 I understood everything correctly, but if 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:41.110
 he was not in the film the Nazis anyway 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:41.770
 would have found the ark brought him to the island 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:53.979
 have hidden 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:55.869
 bat and role -let me cover and what 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.299
 you read pride and prejudice 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.549
 spoiled them for me searching 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:02.590
 of the lost ark so i want 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:11.319
 spoil anything expensive 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:14.230
 and spoiled life is not enough for you though 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:16.660
 how can you ruin the ark? 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.510
 and divides yes only indiana johns them 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.459
 no influence on club events with him 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.690
 or without him the Nazis find the ark 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.690
 opens him eurusd 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.080
 wait a minute the nazis are digging the wrong 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.180
 place 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.610
 they got the ark just because 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.230
 he dug it up first but they didn't dig 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.830
 there only because the medallion was in 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.570
 indians 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.860
 and if they had a locket, they would 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.860
 quietly dug where necessary 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.500
 wait if not for indiana johns 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.220
 only a check would never turn up 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.220
 stock 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:06.460
 and after all he really took the ark and became 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.460
 his authority as a man 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.599
 although in fact he should have driven 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.140
 him in the museum for studying but he and with this 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:15.140
 did not cope 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.300
