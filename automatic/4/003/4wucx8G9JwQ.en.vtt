00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
anything to time owner that I think I'm

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.110 
anything to time owner that I think I'm
thinking<00:02:51.019> one<00:02:51.709> of<00:02:51.830> these<00:02:52.459> yeah<00:02:52.760> I<00:02:52.820> think<00:02:52.910> this

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
thinking one of these yeah I think this

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.990 
thinking one of these yeah I think this
is<00:02:53.180> digital<00:02:53.480> this<00:02:54.320> is<00:02:54.500> the<00:02:54.739> analog<00:02:55.130> one<00:02:55.489> yeah

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
is digital this is the analog one yeah

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.270 
is digital this is the analog one yeah
this<00:02:56.239> is<00:02:56.360> digital<00:02:56.510> in<00:02:56.780> this<00:02:56.900> map<00:02:57.110> but<00:02:58.040> those

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
this is digital in this map but those

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.850 
this is digital in this map but those
suicide<00:02:59.799> some<00:03:01.150> instruction<00:03:02.470> and<00:03:03.470> also<00:03:03.650> the

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
suicide some instruction and also the

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
suicide some instruction and also the
power<00:03:04.100> cable<00:03:04.640> with<00:03:04.820> a<00:03:05.110> flower<00:03:06.640> so<00:03:07.640> he's<00:03:07.850> a

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
power cable with a flower so he's a

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.380 
power cable with a flower so he's a
sticky<00:03:08.360> Fowler<00:03:08.720> I<00:03:09.519> think<00:03:10.519> it's<00:03:10.700> a<00:03:10.850> green<00:03:11.180> or

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
sticky Fowler I think it's a green or

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:22.510 
sticky Fowler I think it's a green or
something<00:03:11.570> that's<00:03:12.019> why<00:03:12.820> quick<00:03:13.820> set-up<00:03:14.150> guide
