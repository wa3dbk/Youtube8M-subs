00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:17.130

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:20.210

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:27.630
 tablespoons of sugar a little sesame and 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:29.760
 frying pan on the grammy of goods house add 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.969
 generally pizza is censured now goes 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:37.370
 garlic finely crushed for roasting 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:44.280
 and red pepper paste you're small but 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:52.920
 so we can deal with sugar 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:57.199
 but the average and most importantly do not miss 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.199
 moment to 40 will begin to settle 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:10.490

 century new guns add he 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.200
 it is necessary to add feather bed 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:50.750

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.030
 do not forget to constantly stir 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:57.470
 because sugar 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.470
 caramelized and need it all the time 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:06.350

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:17.600
 I increase the fire and wait a little 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:19.210
 until this liquid is completely evaporated 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.910
 sauce but always necessarily 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:27.290

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:22.989
