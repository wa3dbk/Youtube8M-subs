back this is the interest for graphics
tablet<00:00:37.280> it<00:00:38.059> comes<00:00:38.390> in<00:00:38.600> three<00:00:38.900> different<00:00:39.080> sizes

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
tablet it comes in three different sizes

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.920 
tablet it comes in three different sizes
and<00:00:39.830> in<00:00:40.489> this<00:00:40.640> review<00:00:41.030> we're<00:00:41.239> looking<00:00:41.570> at<00:00:41.720> the

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
and in this review we're looking at the

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.770 
and in this review we're looking at the
medium<00:00:42.559> size<00:00:42.830> graphics<00:00:43.400> tablet<00:00:43.820> now<00:00:44.420> has<00:00:44.629> an

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
medium size graphics tablet now has an

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.649 
medium size graphics tablet now has an
active<00:00:45.260> area<00:00:45.470> in<00:00:46.100> this<00:00:46.670> central<00:00:47.210> position

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:47.659 
active area in this central position

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:53.770 
active area in this central position
here<00:00:48.110> of<00:00:49.210> 223<00:00:51.309> 540<00:00:52.309> millimeters<00:00:52.970> and<00:00:53.629> that's

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
here of 223 540 millimeters and that's

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.789 
here of 223 540 millimeters and that's
roughly<00:00:54.500> this<00:00:55.220> is<00:00:55.280> an<00:00:55.489> a4<00:00:55.729> sheet<00:00:56.360> of<00:00:56.479> paper

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:56.799 
roughly this is an a4 sheet of paper

00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:01.079 
roughly this is an a4 sheet of paper
roughly<00:00:57.799> half<00:00:58.129> of<00:00:58.370> an<00:00:58.489> a4<00:00:58.670> sheet<00:00:59.290> so<00:01:00.290> a<00:01:00.320> good

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:01.089 
roughly half of an a4 sheet so a good

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:05.229 
roughly half of an a4 sheet so a good
area<00:01:02.089> for<00:01:02.750> actually<00:01:03.229> working<00:01:03.640> on<00:01:04.640> your

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
area for actually working on your

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.039 
area for actually working on your
artwork<00:01:06.100> now<00:01:07.100> these<00:01:07.850> new<00:01:08.299> interest<00:01:08.900> for

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:09.049 
artwork now these new interest for

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:10.920 
artwork now these new interest for
tablets<00:01:09.500> have<00:01:09.619> increased<00:01:10.159> sensitivity

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
tablets have increased sensitivity

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.550 
tablets have increased sensitivity
you'll<00:01:11.930> get<00:01:12.049> in<00:01:12.940> 2048<00:01:13.940> levels<00:01:13.970> of<00:01:14.750> pressure

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
you'll get in 2048 levels of pressure

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.459 
you'll get in 2048 levels of pressure
sensitivity<00:01:15.740> and<00:01:16.700> there's<00:01:17.180> also<00:01:17.509> tilt<00:01:17.930> sensor

00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:18.469 
sensitivity and there's also tilt sensor

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:22.029 
sensitivity and there's also tilt sensor
sensitivity<00:01:19.189> too<00:01:19.729> so<00:01:20.359> with<00:01:20.750> your<00:01:20.899> pen<00:01:21.200> it<00:01:21.710> will

00:01:22.029 --> 00:01:22.039 
sensitivity too so with your pen it will

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:25.510 
sensitivity too so with your pen it will
actually<00:01:23.109> adjust<00:01:24.109> the<00:01:24.680> thickness<00:01:25.189> and<00:01:25.430> the

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
actually adjust the thickness and the

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.090 
actually adjust the thickness and the
angle<00:01:25.909> of<00:01:25.969> your<00:01:26.180> lines<00:01:26.420> if<00:01:26.780> you<00:01:27.109> tilt<00:01:27.590> the<00:01:27.740> pen

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
angle of your lines if you tilt the pen

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.569 
angle of your lines if you tilt the pen
on<00:01:28.310> the<00:01:29.030> tablet<00:01:29.750> as<00:01:29.869> well<00:01:30.079> so<00:01:30.740> really<00:01:30.770> really

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:31.579 
on the tablet as well so really really

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:34.779 
on the tablet as well so really really
nice<00:01:32.649> features<00:01:33.649> on<00:01:33.829> this<00:01:34.009> particular<00:01:34.340> tablet

00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:34.789 
nice features on this particular tablet

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:38.349 
nice features on this particular tablet
now<00:01:35.750> there<00:01:35.990> are<00:01:36.170> eight<00:01:36.469> Express<00:01:37.280> keys<00:01:37.609> down

00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:38.359 
now there are eight Express keys down

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:42.569 
now there are eight Express keys down
the<00:01:38.570> side<00:01:38.810> here<00:01:38.840> and<00:01:40.240> these<00:01:41.240> have<00:01:41.630> tiny<00:01:42.140> little

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
LED screens next to the next to the

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.230 
LED screens next to the next to the
express<00:01:47.359> keys<00:01:47.630> now<00:01:47.929> they<00:01:48.049> can<00:01:48.229> be<00:01:48.350> customized

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
express keys now they can be customized

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.029 
express keys now they can be customized
depending<00:01:50.240> on<00:01:50.390> which<00:01:50.689> application<00:01:50.929> you're<00:01:51.829> in

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:52.039 
depending on which application you're in

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:53.560 
depending on which application you're in
so<00:01:52.219> it<00:01:52.280> will<00:01:52.369> actually<00:01:52.490> show<00:01:52.909> you<00:01:52.939> what<00:01:53.270> the

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
so it will actually show you what the

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.830 
so it will actually show you what the

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
function of each Express key is next to

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.809 
function of each Express key is next to
it<00:01:56.960> on<00:01:57.079> the<00:01:57.170> little<00:01:57.319> screen<00:01:57.740> and<00:01:57.950> if<00:01:58.369> you<00:01:58.490> flip

00:01:58.809 --> 00:01:58.819 
it on the little screen and if you flip

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:02.050 
it on the little screen and if you flip
the<00:01:59.060> tablet<00:01:59.479> round<00:01:59.749> then<00:02:00.530> the<00:02:00.909> orientation<00:02:01.909> of

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
the tablet round then the orientation of

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.679 
the tablet round then the orientation of
the<00:02:02.450> screens<00:02:03.340> rotates<00:02:04.340> as<00:02:04.609> well<00:02:04.819> so<00:02:05.420> it<00:02:05.479> works

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
the screens rotates as well so it works

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:08.020
