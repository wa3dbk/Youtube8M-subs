it<00:01:12.420> looks<00:01:12.689> is<00:01:13.189> the<00:01:14.189> fact<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:14.490> it<00:01:14.640> has<00:01:14.760> dual

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
it looks is the fact that it has dual

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
is large ribbon microphones are able to

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.410 
is large ribbon microphones are able to

capture the nuances the detail and all
the<00:01:24.570> subtleties<00:01:24.990> of<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.409> performance<00:01:25.740> with

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
the subtleties of a performance with

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.160 
the subtleties of a performance with
ribbon<00:01:26.790> microphones<00:01:27.299> that<00:01:27.570> are<00:01:27.630> small

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
ribbon microphones that are small

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.590 
ribbon microphones that are small
elements<00:01:28.740> it<00:01:29.070> tend<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.549> lose<00:01:29.790> that<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:30.270> a

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
elements it tend to lose that to a

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.200 
elements it tend to lose that to a
degree<00:01:30.780> so<00:01:31.619> having<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.369> dual<00:01:32.610> elements

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
degree so having the dual elements

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.569 
degree so having the dual elements
increases<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.049> sensitivity<00:01:34.200> in<00:01:35.100> fact<00:01:35.369> this

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
increases the sensitivity in fact this

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.310 
increases the sensitivity in fact this
microphone<00:01:36.060> sensitivity<00:01:36.329> is<00:01:36.810> rated<00:01:37.170> at

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
microphone sensitivity is rated at

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.140 
microphone sensitivity is rated at
negative<00:01:37.619> 53<00:01:38.490> DBV<00:01:39.950> so<00:01:40.950> with<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:41.670> you're<00:01:41.939> not

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
negative 53 DBV so with it you're not

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.480
