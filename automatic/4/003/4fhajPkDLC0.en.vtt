show you the lay back it might be a
little<00:06:22.020> farther<00:06:22.350> out<00:06:22.680> because<00:06:23.040> i<00:06:23.070> can't<00:06:23.370> do<00:06:23.490> it

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:23.610 
little farther out because i can't do it

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:40.940

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:53.640 
I didn't do a full 180 because I didn't

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.910

you have to have speed so because I

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:00.650
