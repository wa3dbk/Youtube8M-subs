getting them in the right depth from

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.869

from<00:00:53.050> my<00:00:53.230> experience<00:00:53.800> in<00:00:53.890> the<00:00:53.980> past<00:00:54.160> I<00:00:54.519> tend<00:00:54.760> to

00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
from my experience in the past I tend to

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:59.220 
from my experience in the past I tend to
work<00:00:55.089> better<00:00:55.870> and<00:00:56.079> deeper<00:00:56.409> waters<00:00:57.039> like<00:00:57.659> in<00:00:58.659> in

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 
work better and deeper waters like in in

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.189 
work better and deeper waters like in in
an<00:00:59.379> idea<00:00:59.680> over<00:00:59.829> right<00:01:00.129> foot<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:01.750> the<00:01:01.930> cue<00:01:02.170> of

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:02.199 
an idea over right foot and the cue of

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:04.170 
an idea over right foot and the cue of
the<00:01:02.350> water<00:01:02.530> that<00:01:02.710> bear<00:01:02.949> our<00:01:03.129> families<00:01:03.760> I<00:01:03.909> can't

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
the water that bear our families I can't

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.430 
the water that bear our families I can't
think<00:01:04.420> of<00:01:04.479> many<00:01:04.540> times<00:01:04.869> I've<00:01:05.080> had<00:01:05.229> them<00:01:05.350> in

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
think of many times I've had them in

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.310 
think of many times I've had them in
murky<00:01:05.890> water<00:01:06.100> apart<00:01:06.820> from<00:01:07.060> say<00:01:07.630> runs<00:01:07.899> waters

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
murky water apart from say runs waters

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.810 
murky water apart from say runs waters
like<00:01:08.500> for<00:01:08.710> play<00:01:08.979> where<00:01:09.250> you<00:01:09.280> spotted<00:01:09.700> in<00:01:09.790> a

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
like for play where you spotted in a

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.039 
like for play where you spotted in a
totally<00:01:10.240> different<00:01:10.299> scenario

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:11.049 
totally different scenario

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:13.980 
totally different scenario
so<00:01:11.979> yeah<00:01:12.100> generally<00:01:12.399> deep<00:01:12.729> water<00:01:12.940> deeper<00:01:13.869> the

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
so yeah generally deep water deeper the

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:22.680 
so yeah generally deep water deeper the
better<00:01:14.170> and<00:01:14.560> the<00:01:14.860> clearer<00:01:15.100> the<00:01:15.250> better

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.090 

it<00:01:23.690> does<00:01:23.930> depend<00:01:24.290> on<00:01:24.440> the<00:01:24.500> venue

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
it does depend on the venue

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.160 
it does depend on the venue
you<00:01:25.190> know<00:01:25.340> if<00:01:25.460> it's<00:01:25.640> quite<00:01:26.210> a<00:01:26.240> flat<00:01:26.900> bottom

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
you know if it's quite a flat bottom

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.860 
you know if it's quite a flat bottom
like<00:01:27.950> then<00:01:28.310> it<00:01:28.460> can<00:01:28.610> be<00:01:28.790> more<00:01:29.000> of<00:01:29.030> an<00:01:29.180> area<00:01:29.390> you

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:29.870 
like then it can be more of an area you

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.469 
like then it can be more of an area you
know<00:01:30.020> but<00:01:30.200> if<00:01:30.370> if<00:01:31.370> it's<00:01:31.520> baby<00:01:31.790> then<00:01:32.120> it<00:01:32.240> can<00:01:32.390> be

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
know but if if it's baby then it can be

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.300 
know but if if it's baby then it can be
very<00:01:32.510> very<00:01:32.990> spotty<00:01:33.380> or<00:01:33.650> if<00:01:33.740> it's<00:01:33.860> so<00:01:33.979> a<00:01:34.070> little

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
very very spotty or if it's so a little

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.590 
very very spotty or if it's so a little
patch<00:01:34.550> of<00:01:34.580> gravel<00:01:34.820> in<00:01:34.940> a<00:01:35.000> monkey<00:01:35.210> suit<00:01:35.270> and

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
patch of gravel in a monkey suit and

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.450 
patch of gravel in a monkey suit and
stuff<00:01:35.780> that's<00:01:36.320> depend<00:01:36.650> on<00:01:36.740> the<00:01:36.830> venue<00:01:37.130> so

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
stuff that's depend on the venue so

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:38.890 
stuff that's depend on the venue so
there<00:01:37.700> are<00:01:37.760> lakes<00:01:38.000> like<00:01:38.240> lately<00:01:38.570> where<00:01:38.869> I

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
there are lakes like lately where I

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.400 
there are lakes like lately where I
fished<00:01:39.140> there<00:01:39.380> it<00:01:39.890> was<00:01:40.010> exceptionally<00:01:41.000> spotty

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410 
fished there it was exceptionally spotty

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.810 
fished there it was exceptionally spotty
and<00:01:42.410> lakes<00:01:42.650> like<00:01:42.830> this<00:01:43.040> one<00:01:43.220> in<00:01:43.340> Ringwood<00:01:43.520> it

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:43.820 
and lakes like this one in Ringwood it

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.580 
and lakes like this one in Ringwood it
seems<00:01:44.030> to<00:01:44.119> be<00:01:44.210> more<00:01:44.390> back<00:01:44.570> there<00:01:44.810> the<00:01:45.050> vicinity

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
seems to be more back there the vicinity

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:53.160 
seems to be more back there the vicinity
rather<00:01:45.860> than<00:01:46.040> the<00:01:46.160> exact<00:01:46.460> spot

and<00:02:19.070> confidence<00:02:19.490> comes<00:02:19.700> from<00:02:19.820> catching<00:02:20.150> fish

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
and confidence comes from catching fish

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.870 
and confidence comes from catching fish
so<00:02:20.690> if<00:02:20.750> you've<00:02:20.870> caught<00:02:21.080> a<00:02:21.110> few<00:02:21.550> you<00:02:22.550> know<00:02:22.700> what
