00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
right now I'm working it in training the

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:47.159 
right now I'm working it in training the
curl<00:04:44.770> breaking<00:04:45.770> through<00:04:46.010> it<00:04:46.190> with<00:04:46.729> one<00:04:46.940> hand

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:47.169 
curl breaking through it with one hand

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:49.740 
curl breaking through it with one hand
closing<00:04:48.169> the<00:04:48.199> curl<00:04:48.500> back<00:04:48.680> up<00:04:48.860> with<00:04:49.070> the<00:04:49.220> other

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
closing the curl back up with the other

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.050 
closing the curl back up with the other
so<00:04:50.750> the<00:04:50.990> crow<00:04:51.229> at<00:04:51.289> the<00:04:51.500> end<00:04:51.680> see<00:04:52.520> how<00:04:52.610> the<00:04:52.669> ends

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
so the crow at the end see how the ends

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.860 
so the crow at the end see how the ends
get<00:04:53.240> better<00:04:53.479> once<00:04:53.810> you<00:04:53.990> close<00:04:54.199> the<00:04:54.260> curl<00:04:54.650> and

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
get better once you close the curl and

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.629 
get better once you close the curl and
for<00:04:56.870> me<00:04:57.050> that<00:04:57.080> makes<00:04:57.470> micros<00:04:57.949> a<00:04:57.979> lot<00:04:58.310> more

00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639 
for me that makes micros a lot more

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:02.510 
for me that makes micros a lot more
spiral

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:08.189 

um<00:05:03.539> if<00:05:04.539> I<00:05:04.750> left<00:05:05.110> them<00:05:05.409> as<00:05:05.650> they<00:05:06.550> work<00:05:07.080> after<00:05:08.080> i'm

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:08.199 
um if I left them as they work after i'm

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:09.629 
um if I left them as they work after i'm
done<00:05:08.409> this<00:05:08.620> they'd<00:05:08.919> be<00:05:09.069> really<00:05:09.370> really

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:09.639 
done this they'd be really really

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:11.969 
done this they'd be really really
spiraled<00:05:10.060> but<00:05:10.870> in<00:05:10.990> order<00:05:11.229> to<00:05:11.319> where<00:05:11.590> the<00:05:11.800> hair

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:11.979 
spiraled but in order to where the hair

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:13.619 
spiraled but in order to where the hair
style<00:05:12.220> that<00:05:12.400> I<00:05:12.460> like<00:05:12.490> to<00:05:12.879> wear<00:05:13.060> I<00:05:13.090> have<00:05:13.389> to<00:05:13.509> have
