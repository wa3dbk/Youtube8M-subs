00:00:08.739 --> 00:00:10.359
 let's see how to create 

00:00:10.359 --> 00:00:13.539
 between the resale of frontex design 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:16.699
 a simple web page 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:18.849
 this initial page 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:22.060
 i three pages that depend on her 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.439
 The first thing to do is close 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.439
 the sites that most adept a more open pajera 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.250
 by I follow 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.660
 close sites close pages second 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.170
 but creation 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.160
 give to the new 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.350
 and in the panel that appears on the right 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.350
 we should think one page website 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.130
 later on we can be so good 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.130
 blank page 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.910
 in this window 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.680
 from among the attendees that exist 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.670
 and that we will use again was the website of the page 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.300
 although there are others 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.200
 for other types of pages 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.080
 more complex 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.100
 personal website 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.730
 important to choose a folder 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.520
 without knowing where we are going to endorse the page 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.590
 we can address the site 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.090
 or if you have a folder with the series b 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.950
 files and folders 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.000
 cobos changed 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.270
 the default booth 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.220
 eat them as recommended 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.220
 change it 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.610
 the change a folder to make 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.470
 for example 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.300
 I could continue without titles 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.300
 and here and we believe in folder for example 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.200
 and is that the woman 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.200
 conae create it 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.899
 we are not creating a folder in the one websites folder and here is your 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.899
 to the page we accept 

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:16.369
 as you see, it has not been created 

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:19.829
 a folder the points vars tilburg 1 within it 

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:23.059
 a series folders a couple images 

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:26.059
 and the home page the index point htm 

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:28.889
 this is the page that see the user when 

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:31.199
 with these websites 

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:32.769
 we should 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:35.769
 give content 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:39.599
 we double click 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:42.599
 Quique on the right we appear on the page 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:47.019
 right now it is empty and we are interested in adding content 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:51.079
 a text or images 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:53.639
 I have already prepared some 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:56.639
 documents 

00:02:57.499 --> 00:02:58.779
 specifically 

00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:01.679
 for the main page of an image 

00:03:01.679 --> 00:03:04.959
 and a file the text 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:06.209
 you talked about goat 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.209
 and copied the content that interests me 

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:15.449
 I'm going to copy some text 

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:17.289
 for example 

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:20.289
 with this conference 

00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:26.149
 I come back with frontex 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:31.609
 and I have 

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:35.099
 the information that never 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:37.869
 if you want to enter an image doubts like contests nene 

00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:40.869
 chÃ¡vez that sergio like here 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.149
 let's take out 

00:03:45.149 --> 00:03:47.469
 image of this file 

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:50.129
 we are going to 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:53.069
 the folder where the images are 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:56.069
 we want to be 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:01.329
 there had to be the folder with 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:04.509
 and you are interested molt mÃ©s term 

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:07.759
 copy the venice interest 

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:10.759
 and sometimes it appears on the page 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:13.779
 below the text 

00:04:13.779 --> 00:04:17.349
 if you want to leave it right you can apply some of these properties 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.479
 I could also have made a table 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:26.900
 It should be highlighted and placed to the right of the table by a 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.289
 they were designed 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:31.999
 once the page is already built with that image it is a text 

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:32.849
 suitable 

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:34.960
 to be able to do the rest 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.439
 what pages 

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:38.900
 of this website 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.309
 then let's say something all in 

00:04:41.309 --> 00:04:44.449
 to create a new standard page 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:46.939
 a new national tab appears 

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:49.370
 like that format according to assistants 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.939
 I will not use it 

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:54.520
 I have a new page 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.060
 that he should return the goal to have a man adjusted to what 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.059
 we want 

00:04:59.059 --> 00:05:02.059
 I'm going to look for him to call him 

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:06.219
 showcase 

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:08.830
 go Go 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.589
 and again you have to save 

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:14.029
 they commit information texts and images from the east 

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:16.599
 of this file 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:17.780
 we are going to kill 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:20.780
 to see the carpetania that I have information 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:27.080
 kirk 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.809
 As before 

00:05:28.809 --> 00:05:31.809
 we copy other entities 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:40.020
 and let's have 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:41.999
 that we have embassy in Cuba 

00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:44.719
 where we are so hard 

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:46.479
 We are the board on August 11 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:49.210
 a white line according to interest 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:50.589
 again 

00:05:50.589 --> 00:05:52.249
 of those assets 

00:05:52.249 --> 00:05:55.249
 we look for a showcase you think 

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:59.289
 and so with all the pages 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.990
 important and wait for the pages we are doing 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.990
 change the folder of the images 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.770
 and pass it possibly there is more 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:17.210
 the same in English 

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:23.119
 they were very low 

00:06:23.119 --> 00:06:26.119
 more than 180 seats 

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:34.210
 The rest of the pages are created in the same way 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.990
 and at the end of everything there has to be 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:39.990
 watching the camera images a series of images 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.800
 those that are inside the pages 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.369
 the kpk so I hang you 1 

00:06:47.369 --> 00:06:50.169

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:52.770
 from the pages of the site 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:54.959
 English ignacio that has that is the main page
