that they regretted them so i can

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:04.810 
that they regretted them so i can
actually<00:04:03.620> get<00:04:03.920> him<00:04:04.040> a<00:04:04.160> lot<00:04:04.310> of<00:04:04.400> people<00:04:04.520> slept

actually get him a lot of people slept

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.130 
actually get him a lot of people slept
on<00:04:04.970> this<00:04:05.090> you<00:04:05.209> people<00:04:05.480> really<00:04:05.690> worried<00:04:05.959> about

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.140 
on this you people really worried about

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.440 
on this you people really worried about
the<00:04:06.290> 11th<00:04:06.770> and<00:04:06.980> the<00:04:07.430> six<00:04:07.700> is<00:04:07.850> instead<00:04:08.150> of<00:04:08.209> the

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
the 11th and the six is instead of the

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.240 
the 11th and the six is instead of the
13th<00:04:08.900> and<00:04:09.140> I<00:04:09.230> think<00:04:09.410> the<00:04:09.500> 13th<00:04:09.859> were<00:04:10.010> better

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
13th and I think the 13th were better

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.200 
13th and I think the 13th were better
than<00:04:10.340> the<00:04:10.670> sixes<00:04:11.060> in<00:04:11.090> my<00:04:11.329> opinion

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:12.210 
than the sixes in my opinion

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:14.360 
than the sixes in my opinion
and<00:04:12.630> 11th<00:04:13.170> because<00:04:13.560> I'm<00:04:13.860> not<00:04:13.950> a<00:04:14.010> big<00:04:14.190> fan<00:04:14.220> of

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
and 11th because I'm not a big fan of

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.270 
and 11th because I'm not a big fan of
the<00:04:14.550> 11-time<00:04:15.060> lunch<00:04:15.330> the<00:04:15.450> 30s<00:04:15.810> better<00:04:15.990> so<00:04:16.560> I'd

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
the 11-time lunch the 30s better so I'd

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.480 
the 11-time lunch the 30s better so I'd
