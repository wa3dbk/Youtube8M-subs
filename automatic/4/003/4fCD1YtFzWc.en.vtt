follow so the best person to try the

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.810 
follow so the best person to try the
side<00:00:41.870> me<00:00:42.199> because<00:00:42.589> I<00:00:42.800> have<00:00:43.070> absolutely<00:00:43.580> no

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
side me because I have absolutely no

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.610 
side me because I have absolutely no
eyelashes<00:00:44.420> I<00:00:44.449> mean<00:00:44.629> I<00:00:44.720> do<00:00:44.780> have<00:00:45.140> our<00:00:45.260> lashes

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
eyelashes I mean I do have our lashes

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:46.930 
eyelashes I mean I do have our lashes
but<00:00:45.739> they're<00:00:45.890> really<00:00:46.220> really<00:00:46.400> short<00:00:46.579> and

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
but they're really really short and

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.090 
but they're really really short and
they're<00:00:47.540> very<00:00:47.720> thin<00:00:47.989> so<00:00:48.320> this<00:00:48.589> is<00:00:48.739> perfect

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
they're very thin so this is perfect

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.380 
they're very thin so this is perfect
because<00:00:49.129> if<00:00:49.519> it<00:00:49.640> makes<00:00:49.790> a<00:00:49.879> difference<00:00:49.909> to<00:00:50.180> my

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
because if it makes a difference to my

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.270 
because if it makes a difference to my
eyelashes<00:00:50.839> then<00:00:51.379> it'll<00:00:51.589> definitely<00:00:51.829> make<00:00:52.129> a

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
eyelashes then it'll definitely make a

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.250 
eyelashes then it'll definitely make a
difference<00:00:52.640> to<00:00:52.699> anybody<00:00:53.059> else's<00:00:53.420> so<00:00:54.079> what

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
difference to anybody else's so what

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.479 
difference to anybody else's so what
I've<00:00:54.350> done<00:00:54.500> is<00:00:54.559> gone<00:00:54.710> ahead<00:00:54.920> and<00:00:55.070> apply<00:00:55.430> this

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
I've done is gone ahead and apply this

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:57.340 
I've done is gone ahead and apply this
first<00:00:55.879> gel<00:00:56.420> which<00:00:56.720> is<00:00:56.839> like<00:00:56.960> a<00:00:56.989> mascara

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350

first gel which is like a mascara
basically<00:00:57.980> you<00:00:58.460> apply<00:00:58.489> that<00:00:58.910> and<00:00:59.059> express

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
basically you apply that and express

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.299 
basically you apply that and express
away<00:00:59.510> a<00:00:59.539> few<00:00:59.809> seconds<00:01:00.170> for<00:01:00.260> it<00:01:00.320> to<00:01:00.469> dry<00:01:00.739> or<00:01:01.010> turn

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309

away a few seconds for it to dry or turn
tacky<00:01:01.820> and<00:01:02.000> then<00:01:02.390> you<00:01:02.480> apply<00:01:02.719> the<00:01:02.780> fibers<00:01:03.260> like

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.410 
tacky and then you apply the fibers like

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.229 
tacky and then you apply the fibers like
I'm<00:01:03.559> doing<00:01:03.800> here<00:01:04.039> I'll<00:01:04.699> throw<00:01:04.879> away<00:01:04.940> you<00:01:05.089> don't

I'm doing here I'll throw away you don't
know<00:01:05.479> is<00:01:05.690> a<00:01:05.899> great<00:01:06.259> difference<00:01:06.530> I<00:01:06.890> mean<00:01:07.009> there

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.160 
know is a great difference I mean there

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.350 
know is a great difference I mean there
is<00:01:07.280> a<00:01:07.310> bit<00:01:07.460> of<00:01:07.520> a<00:01:07.580> difference<00:01:07.910> but<00:01:08.060> you<00:01:08.119> can

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
is a bit of a difference but you can

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.969 
is a bit of a difference but you can
sort<00:01:08.539> of<00:01:08.570> achieve<00:01:08.840> this<00:01:08.960> look<00:01:09.200> with<00:01:09.500> a<00:01:09.530> mascara

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
sort of achieve this look with a mascara

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.600 
sort of achieve this look with a mascara
anyway<00:01:11.530> so<00:01:12.530> now<00:01:12.770> I'm<00:01:12.890> just<00:01:13.009> going<00:01:13.160> to<00:01:13.220> go<00:01:13.369> ahead

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
anyway so now I'm just going to go ahead

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.700 
anyway so now I'm just going to go ahead
and<00:01:13.820> seal<00:01:14.149> it<00:01:14.300> again<00:01:14.539> with<00:01:14.750> the<00:01:14.869> mascara<00:01:15.410> so

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
and seal it again with the mascara so

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.770 
and seal it again with the mascara so
you<00:01:15.770> apply<00:01:16.640> the<00:01:16.700> gel<00:01:17.060> and<00:01:17.330> then<00:01:17.479> you<00:01:17.539> apply<00:01:17.720> the

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
you apply the gel and then you apply the

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.779 
you apply the gel and then you apply the
fibers<00:01:18.440> and<00:01:18.679> then<00:01:18.890> you<00:01:18.979> seal<00:01:19.190> it<00:01:19.310> again<00:01:19.580> with

00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:19.789 
fibers and then you seal it again with

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:26.630 
fibers and then you seal it again with
the<00:01:19.850> gel<00:01:20.060> that's<00:01:20.360> the<00:01:20.780> method

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.460 

so<00:01:27.210> as<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.360> can<00:01:27.480> see<00:01:27.540> this<00:01:27.810> is<00:01:27.960> how<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.230> looks

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
so as you can see this is how it looks

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.500 
so as you can see this is how it looks
with<00:01:28.710> one<00:01:29.100> coat<00:01:29.400> of<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.850> fiber

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510 
with one coat of the fiber

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.050 
with one coat of the fiber
so<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:31.140> basically<00:01:31.320> applied<00:01:31.830> the<00:01:31.980> e<00:01:32.010> gel<00:01:32.400> fiber

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
so I basically applied the e gel fiber

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.180 
so I basically applied the e gel fiber
and<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.660> gel<00:01:33.840> again<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.230> seal<00:01:34.410> it<00:01:34.530> all<00:01:34.680> there

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
and the gel again to seal it all there

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.680 
and the gel again to seal it all there
is<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.370> difference<00:01:35.820> but<00:01:36.060> like<00:01:36.180> I<00:01:36.210> said<00:01:36.360> you<00:01:36.540> can

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
is a difference but like I said you can

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.070 
is a difference but like I said you can
achieve<00:01:36.810> this<00:01:37.260> look<00:01:37.560> with<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:38.190> normal<00:01:38.520> mascara

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
achieve this look with a normal mascara

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.720

now it looks like I'm applying a lot of

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.199 
now it looks like I'm applying a lot of
fibers<00:02:16.650> I'm<00:02:16.860> not<00:02:17.190> actually<00:02:17.580> basically<00:02:18.030> just

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
fibers I'm not actually basically just

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.000 
fibers I'm not actually basically just
using<00:02:18.540> what's<00:02:18.690> on<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:18.930> wand<00:02:19.140> just<00:02:19.739> trying<00:02:19.920> to

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
using what's on the wand just trying to

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.550 
using what's on the wand just trying to
get<00:02:20.100> it<00:02:20.280> on<00:02:20.459> all<00:02:20.910> the<00:02:21.060> lashes<00:02:21.239> now<00:02:22.110> my<00:02:22.320> lashes

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
get it on all the lashes now my lashes

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.770 
get it on all the lashes now my lashes
are<00:02:22.830> very<00:02:22.980> short<00:02:23.400> and<00:02:23.670> very<00:02:23.760> thin<00:02:24.090> so<00:02:24.390> for<00:02:24.600> even

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
are very short and very thin so for even

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.930 
are very short and very thin so for even
look<00:02:25.020> like<00:02:25.200> this<00:02:25.380> was<00:02:25.739> a<00:02:25.770> big<00:02:26.160> WOW<00:02:26.430> factor<00:02:26.459> for

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
look like this was a big WOW factor for

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.540 
look like this was a big WOW factor for
me<00:02:27.180> so<00:02:27.840> this<00:02:28.290> is<00:02:28.350> really<00:02:28.590> good<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:29.070> this<00:02:29.430> is

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
me so this is really good and this is

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.220 
me so this is really good and this is
just<00:02:29.730> with<00:02:29.880> a<00:02:29.910> second<00:02:30.330> coat<00:02:30.480> of<00:02:30.510> progress<00:02:31.019> and

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
just with a second coat of progress and

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.020 
just with a second coat of progress and
I've<00:02:31.680> just<00:02:31.920> sealed<00:02:32.070> all<00:02:32.220> that<00:02:32.370> in<00:02:32.459> place<00:02:32.670> with

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
I've just sealed all that in place with

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.960 
I've just sealed all that in place with
the<00:02:33.269> gel<00:02:33.890> so<00:02:34.890> this<00:02:35.040> is<00:02:35.160> how<00:02:35.280> it<00:02:35.370> looks<00:02:35.519> like

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
the gel so this is how it looks like

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.300 
the gel so this is how it looks like
with<00:02:36.150> only<00:02:36.390> two<00:02:36.720> coats<00:02:36.959> of<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.230> fiber<00:02:37.470> as<00:02:37.860> you

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
with only two coats of the fiber as you

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.430 
with only two coats of the fiber as you
can<00:02:38.459> see<00:02:38.640> it's<00:02:38.970> really<00:02:39.330> thick<00:02:39.720> it's<00:02:40.080> really

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
can see it's really thick it's really

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.560 
can see it's really thick it's really
long<00:02:40.709> and<00:02:41.070> definitely<00:02:42.030> a<00:02:42.150> difference<00:02:42.450> between

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
long and definitely a difference between

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.210 
long and definitely a difference between
my<00:02:42.840> two<00:02:43.049> eyes

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.680 

if<00:02:47.220> you<00:02:47.400> don't<00:02:47.550> like<00:02:47.730> spider<00:02:48.060> lashes<00:02:48.300> if<00:02:48.660> you

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
if you don't like spider lashes if you

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.930 
if you don't like spider lashes if you
don't<00:02:48.870> like<00:02:48.989> clumpy<00:02:49.319> lashes<00:02:49.400> if<00:02:50.400> you<00:02:50.760> don't

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
don't like clumpy lashes if you don't

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:51.920 
don't like clumpy lashes if you don't
like<00:02:51.090> actually<00:02:51.450> looking<00:02:51.660> like<00:02:51.690> this

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
like actually looking like this

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.809 
like actually looking like this
basically<00:02:52.200> then<00:02:52.739> stay<00:02:52.980> away<00:02:53.010> because<00:02:53.400> I<00:02:53.610> don't

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
basically then stay away because I don't

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.119 
basically then stay away because I don't
think<00:02:54.090> you<00:02:54.269> can<00:02:54.450> achieve<00:02:54.540> a<00:02:55.019> clean<00:02:55.290> look<00:02:55.650> that

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
considering false lashes but for me this

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.180 
considering false lashes but for me this
was<00:03:23.819> WOW<00:03:24.540> enough<00:03:24.930> I<00:03:25.140> really<00:03:25.620> like<00:03:25.799> this<00:03:26.040> effect

on<00:04:55.370> to<00:04:55.460> my<00:04:55.550> hijab

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
on to my hijab

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.480 
on to my hijab
it's<00:04:56.570> very<00:04:56.750> pretty<00:04:57.050> very<00:04:57.380> chunky<00:04:57.740> it<00:04:58.340> does

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
it's very pretty very chunky it does

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.159 
it's very pretty very chunky it does
also<00:04:58.729> catch<00:04:59.030> the<00:04:59.180> light<00:04:59.389> it's<00:04:59.690> really<00:04:59.990> nice

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:00.169 
also catch the light it's really nice

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:01.780 
also catch the light it's really nice
and<00:05:00.680> I<00:05:00.800> think<00:05:00.830> to<00:05:01.070> wear<00:05:01.220> a<00:05:01.250> necklace<00:05:01.460> like<00:05:01.700> this

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:01.790 
and I think to wear a necklace like this

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:03.760 
and I think to wear a necklace like this
makes<00:05:02.210> it<00:05:02.389> a<00:05:02.450> whole<00:05:02.600> look<00:05:02.810> look<00:05:03.020> more<00:05:03.560> elegant

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
makes it a whole look look more elegant

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.100 
makes it a whole look look more elegant
so<00:05:04.250> if<00:05:04.700> you've<00:05:04.850> got<00:05:05.030> a<00:05:05.090> chocolate<00:05:05.330> necklace

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.110 
so if you've got a chocolate necklace

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:07.180 
so if you've got a chocolate necklace
that<00:05:06.229> you<00:05:06.350> can't<00:05:06.560> wear<00:05:06.740> around<00:05:06.950> your<00:05:07.100> neck

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
that you can't wear around your neck

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.610 
that you can't wear around your neck
because<00:05:07.669> of<00:05:07.820> the<00:05:08.000> job<00:05:08.540> because<00:05:09.140> too<00:05:09.320> tight
