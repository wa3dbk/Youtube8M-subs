00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.700

 but it is ready for a new mixtape 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:42.250

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.850
 sometimes an insult abroad at least 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.879
 do not turn around income then because 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.980
 Much of the music combination comes from 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:55.150
 from the hand of jill and accordingly 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.489
 it is actually a bit more there 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:00.070
 a topic because he is our leader ours 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:01.780

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.229
 do not rag 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.810
 now said one again and again 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:11.800

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:33.190
 a day to go to the morning country 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.390
 at home and, above all, it is 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.760
 again no costs and trouble spared 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.100
 As always, it is an issue 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.690
 so when should he come out to change 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.270
 if then said on the weekend 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.430
 yes in any case on time as 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.500
 so much that it's on 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.050
 topic for me is music i have 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.960
 I ever in an independent 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.310
 jet mentions music is really for me 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.170
 once the biggest motivation ever 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.690
 you look at one sees me in the 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.040
 always with heart and jim on the one hand 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.720
 I would not babble on 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.430
 at least not during the sentences, then 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.870
 I also like to speak 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.910
 like to please but not during the 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.649
 Jamsession we come there completely always 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.769
 come out of the jars that 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:15.129
 annoying one of the reasons and just 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:17.920
 it is said with studies that 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:19.180
 one with the favorite route roja if 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.550
 you the the favorite track around the 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.590
 ears fix up to 20 percent more power 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.980
 Has 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.780
 the motorcycle tells us so we have the 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.849
 something thoroughly easier to stream 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.040
 if you only do it with the 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:35.110
 background noise 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.760
 that would be out again but 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.260
 something from his australian trips 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.420
 tell but I stay with the topic 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.489
 music actually it's back in 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.700
 the same direction as we are talking about here 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:48.400
 Electronic folklore is what you have to do 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.959
 say but I take distance from the 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.430
 I like it commercial mock 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.470
 even then I am originally from 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.910
 the area you have there, however 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.150
 but only the underground 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.920
 The things do not celebrate in the radio 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.190
 came and warned all tracks the system 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.780
 and then if it is altogether 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.329
 which then made it to the radio 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.370
 I feel like I have reported 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:13.150
 afterwards it was also chris brown lady with 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:15.099
 with save the world to me or something like that 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.680
 art is already here forever 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:20.530
 i was 29 the time was between 16 and 21 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:23.230
 can you figure it out like madame 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.720
 Of course, 13 years is a tough one 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:29.019
 generation and now in the meantime 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:31.090
 Gym I immensely celebrate the electro-music 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:33.180
 and besides not commercial 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:37.930
 must rattle properly that must be right 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:42.989
 flats are hard beats there 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:45.760
 he comes out of the book and it 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.079
 Do not wait until we finish 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.940
 Sometimes they are quite whole with the media 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:49.780
 in a hurry and I want three cats 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:54.489
 live to promote 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:57.310
 maybe yes yes yes yes never felt like it 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:59.560
 I was even naked so it's little 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:03.220
 vocals in it means little singing 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:05.319
 so earlier is our dj dj devils 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.819

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:07.389
 state unfortunately not like this time 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:09.099
 before 

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:11.200
 but I trust him for mixed 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:12.730
 help by 5 just immensely that just the 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.010
 tracks who named her 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.139
 are built beautiful transitions in it 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.180
 are now synonymous with shakespeare 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:20.620
 ozu glory every three to four we have 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.750
 Let's see if he can implement it 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.120
 I was really looking forward to it 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.650
 last test mode has me personally up 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.690
 Here's the best thing to see if 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.849
 he can still put one on it so the 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.890
 Songs are definitely inviting 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:35.169
 I have been back in the last 30 days 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:36.090
 neatly collected a beautiful 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:37.680
 playlist together 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.870

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.810
 similar to me actually like 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:45.270
 I am especially good for a woman 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.460
 that ended the last song yes yes who 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.290
 would like to see his favorite song again 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.600
 That's right at the end of the year 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:54.060

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.220

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:17.430

 with the tape called yes how would it have 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.789
 can be different 

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:28.970
 half of it was learned by that 

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:31.289
 the name of the title of the mixtapes 

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:33.060
 Keep all of you writing the commons like 

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:34.169
 it may also write in 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.000
 the comments if you are a bit 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:37.500
 we want to build other years, too 

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.919
 among other things little trap hip hop and 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.780
 like this 

00:06:37.919 --> 00:06:43.500
 that is also pretty much in places 

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:45.659
 pretty dependent so partysound first time 

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:47.020
 Know what you have built in there 

00:06:45.659 --> 00:06:48.460
 and if we also rock a bit 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:50.560
 should be brought in with the 

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:53.830
 Of course, go a bit harder 

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:55.680
 well it 's hard from electro on 

00:06:53.830 --> 00:07:00.190
 rock transitions to conjure but also 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:01.750
 upstairs and down your stories so it 

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:04.180
 is definitely feasible and ours 

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:05.889
 talent never janet knows for sure 

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:07.240
 So deal in the comments what 

00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:09.610
 you want to get in there next 

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:11.110

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:13.240
 spaceship laurie mixtape around the ears 

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:15.009

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:16.930
 busy thumbs up in the field 

00:07:15.009 --> 00:07:19.740
 Of course, the clicks also want to be 

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:21.819
 then we have to see sprout again 

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:23.560
