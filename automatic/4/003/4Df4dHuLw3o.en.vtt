rooting your device here is my firmware

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.799 
rooting your device here is my firmware
version<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.230> G<00:00:37.620> 9<00:00:37.829> -<00:00:38.219> 5<00:00:38.399> V<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:39.030> OC<00:00:39.390> 3<00:00:39.570> there

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
version the G 9 - 5 V a OC 3 there

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.260 
version the G 9 - 5 V a OC 3 there
that's<00:00:40.079> me<00:00:40.500> so<00:00:41.280> that<00:00:41.430> would<00:00:41.550> be<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.760> Verizon

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
that's me so that would be the Verizon

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.600 
that's me so that would be the Verizon
variant<00:00:42.690> on<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.930> latest<00:00:43.260> firmware<00:00:43.469> so<00:00:44.460> what

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
variant on the latest firmware so what

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:45.860 
variant on the latest firmware so what
we'll<00:00:44.730> do<00:00:44.820> here<00:00:45.059> is<00:00:45.120> we'll<00:00:45.300> scroll<00:00:45.600> down<00:00:45.750> to

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
we'll do here is we'll scroll down to

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.990 
we'll do here is we'll scroll down to
the<00:00:45.989> bottom<00:00:46.250> and<00:00:47.250> we'll<00:00:47.579> grab<00:00:47.789> this
