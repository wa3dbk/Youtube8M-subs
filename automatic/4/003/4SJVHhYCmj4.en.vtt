00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.810
 what's happening live welcome to 365 bboying 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.630
 everyday we start with the 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.189
 workouts already 165 practicing 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.660
 mills without going through baby is very 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:24.939
 important that at every turn in the head 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.070
 go find the next point and then 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:28.390
 trying to link to many that the 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.160
 truth is that it costs quite this 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.390
 close it and reopen it and follow the 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.370
 inertia I do not tell you anymore 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.470
 and here testing it from bucks ping and 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.390
 then I'm learning a rock club 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.980
 from the butterfly slide of shoulder and 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.870
 Here I learned the set Knockout 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.850
 inspired by fat and fusion rockers 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:46.000
 in the battle that touched me against him in 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.230
 the challenge of jimb on day 166 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.870
 training in calella with neighborhood and 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.460
 company trying to pass win thousand air 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.710
 but you have to be clear about where 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.270
 you jump where you put your hands and 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.649
 where are the legs going and go 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.980
 trying different sensations with 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:02.550
 legs open and legs closed 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.530
 there I pricked myself with a staple day 167 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.420
 learning from mill opposite to elbow 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.130
 jalo freeze opposite and since I was 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.960
 I learned to change an elbow halo 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.820
 freeze to the other and it is very important 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.830
 change the point of support of both the elbow 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.210
 as from the hand that we put as 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.400
 making a set that calls him time of 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.619
 close because it went up open and then 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.880
 closed first came back to elbow jalo 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.150
 bad freeze and then I go to the good 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.710
 obviously day 168 how I hurt the 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.080
 dolls I was working quite the 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.300
 expression in both the top box and the 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.700
 futures as in the flows rocks as in 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.380
 ways to lower ways to raise the 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.220
 energy and the speed that I give in 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.750
 each step the orientation the look the 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.090
 changes in height are also very 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.590
 important to make it look dynamic and 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.970
 doing this work many times you 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.979
 come ideas to do later 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.410
 more beautiful movements and that in addition to your 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.869
 body comes out natural here an idea 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:53.789
 to get out of a flow and I was 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.289
 practicing the thompsons that the trick 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:57.030
 is on how to make a mill with a head 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:58.740
 trying to pass by the shoulder and by the 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.050
 head but the hip and legs are 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.509
 very important here here I invented a 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.920
 new flow to put in a set and the 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.439
 set was like that I called him 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.380
 pack bum more than anything for this to 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:13.140
 here I need to clean it and do it more 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.940
 handsome and all that but this is the idea and 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.849
 maybe I repeat too many times in the flu 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.620
 rock would have to do it less times and 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.870
 then the idea would be to put power from 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.580
 there what the scoundrel will tell me that day 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:27.959
 that sees very burst but with many 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:30.150
 ideas was happy day 169 at what 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.410
 shoulder training in killed he was already going 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.790
 catching and could do a few 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.790
 but there is one thing that failed me 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:39.200
 and that did not do strength with the shoulder only 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:42.489
 I had to try it and it improves a lot 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.489
 thanks magic for the advice 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.880
 and then I tried to try two followed but 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.670
 that's another story 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.470
 DÃ­az 170 improving this Zulu football 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.030
 knee espn the truth is that everything 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.610
 this type of football is that way 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.990
 I love it and then I was creating some 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.100
 sets from some ideas that I got 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.350
 they happened the day before doing 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.750
 freestyle I take a flawed climb 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.430
 head and do this here the spider up 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.230
 that is silly but to nail it 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.709
 does not wait for anyone and this same as 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.900
 I have called the 171 day accordion 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.000
 dolls every day hurt me more and more like this 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.790
 that I decided to rest a bit practicing 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.740
 all the time that espn and then in addition to 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.060
 with the helmet with the hat the truth is 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.980
 that at last I thought it was much more 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.989
 easy to learn and if you give a couple of 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.900
 laps is fine but hold it alone 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:28.489
 with the head it is hard day 172 follow 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.020
 with the sprint I do not do it because I had 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:32.120
 things like lowering the legs that 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.980
 had automated and I could concentrate 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:38.090
 more on doing strength with the head day 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:39.380
 173 in london travel with nois as no 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.459
 there was another place I had to get to 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.050
 do physical preparation in the 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:43.700
 room but then we went to a local 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.270
 where there was live music and they played 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.270
 james brown 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.810
 already 174 training at london bridge with 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.890
 Chinese bow checking a little air 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.330
 freight to see that I had not 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.880
 forgotten was also in kick-off 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:22.390
 crisis his electrolyte tangerine and 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:24.070
 vo of flavor kings day 175 we went back to 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.450
 train the london bridge remembering the 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.010
 shoulder halo and doing a bit of 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.780
 freestyle by the way there followed me 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.160
 the dolls hurt a lot but I am 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:32.020
 one more plays and now I realize by 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.820
 what is not healing me this day we had to 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.620
 have competed in Birmingham in the 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.480
 classifier of the world boy classics 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.670
 but canceled by snow and 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.080
 they were so wide come and we had already 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:43.420
 bought the train and bus ticket and 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.280
 we did not return the money and worth to them and 

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:48.870
 already to finish stretching until the 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.870
 next video to take care of myself I'm going
