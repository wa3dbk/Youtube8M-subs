 received today and look at the 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.890
 true that this is something that is no longer seen 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.030
 a lot of the case companies have 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.799

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.049
 Microfiber have also included what 

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:57.760
 which is a screen saver something that 

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:59.440
 the companies are not sending much 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.479
 they are the truth that is very, very 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.670
 well we will proceed to take what is the 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:06.520
 founds itself and we will show it is 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:09.280
 like a bone style because it's stylish 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.380
 inserted then we have these courts and 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.390
 we are going to show you why 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.330
 can see here is what is this the 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.460
 case comes from two parts two pieces one 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.880
 this for example is that it is totally 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.380
 rubber hot pu and this other piece that is 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.220
 of inserted style that is totally of 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.410
 plastic some small design back 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.000
 to give it a little style and we're going to 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.520
 proceed to put what is our sleeve 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.010
 this with this thread but we only put 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.990
 the following way friends check the 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.090
 top part we put what is the 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.730
 bottom part and since it is what it is 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.800
 what is our foundation laid or to 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.630
 less this piece we will proceed to put what 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.730
 which is the back and it's just 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.160
 putting it in position by himself and this 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.750
 falls in the way that the truth must go 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.610
 how good this first type of cover 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.350
 time you see me I like the design 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.090
 like the model because it gives us what 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.770
 what is the protection of a bumper and the 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.970
 same time it gives us this design very but 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.040
 that very nice what is the part of 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.860
 back here they bring what is the logo of the 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.140
 company on the bottom as another 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.970
 inserted this is totally 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.100
 different brings three individual holes 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.660
 one for what is the microphone and the 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.330
 hearing aids other what is to be able 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.680
 load our iphone and here is what 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.690
 is the speaker of our of this 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.870
 phone then be totally 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.220
 covered with three individual holes in 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.740
 the top part comes totally 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.660
 covered with a small button that this one 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.760
 it gives us the feeling of being using the 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.620
 original button power and the truth that 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.000
 is very well positioned very soft the 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.550
 true 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.380
 very easy when it comes to using what that 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.910
 function is not like other cases that 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.950
 they are very, very strong, what is 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.260
 this part in the part of the other of what 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.270
 which are two buttons also for what 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.130
 are our volumes of buttons 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.870
 volumes and brings what is a small 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.240
 cut for what is the switch 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.740
 sounds a little bit of this little the 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.870
 true that for other people who 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.850
 have thicker fingers are going to be 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.740
 a little bit uncomfortable but also this one 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.350
 is accessible the only thing that we have to 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.490
 put a little more the nail in the part 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.650
 in front brings screen design 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.300
 on the table very good we can put it 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.260
 in this way and here is the case 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.260
 gentlemen wake 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.110
 sou este the prodigy on the website of 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.260
 them is a price of 34 dollars with 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:20.110
 99 cents you see take it out there remember 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.670
 that always something that I am 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.410
 I highly recommend that you look in 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.570
 all the websites that can and 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.520
 buy them where they are cheaper 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:30.280
 this other question that a lot of people have 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.440
 it's like with shipping problems go 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.300
 to be their website read gentlemen and 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.120
 that many people who are buying from 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.160
 outside of the us this report is from a 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.870
 shortly before the shipments I can not 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.950
 say how long it takes for the shipment to 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.090
 other countries 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.530
 I can only talk about my experience 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.620
 that for example here in the states 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:50.940
 united and there is a system of sending the 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:53.290
 postal mail that is two to three days 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.450
 guaranteed your product already in orders 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.590
 international I could not tell you but 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.600
 I am more than sure that this information 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.040
 is the website there see you gentlemen 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.810
 this also something else that is before 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.180
 I forget two colors come in black 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.890
 and blank can go check it will not be 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.560
 until next time I have and we are prodigy 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.700
 force in in case for review and this 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.320
 lady we said goodbye if you liked 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.630
 the video leave in like now we are 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.700
 bringing checked cases for what 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:18.130
 they are the iphone 5 the iphone 5 s 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.959
 thing I wanted to take this into account and 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.070
 they sent me this other cover that 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.610
 could have seen in the video a 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:26.680
 boxing is the c slide for the iphone 5 c 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:29.590
 and that product unfortunately not what 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.570
 I have what that phone is over here 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.040
 can see the case completely from 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:35.229
 plastic and I think it's a sheath of 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.270
 slipped style that I already have 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:39.520

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.169
 screen protectors and here is the 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.970
 cover brings all this pile of holes 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:45.250
 which I think is very good and there it is 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:46.810
 well this I think that the least I can 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.389
 to do is show it to you even though you do not 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:51.100
