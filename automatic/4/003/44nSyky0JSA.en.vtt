00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:04.709
 W 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.850
 you already know that the processors 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:09.909
 they are the heart of the markets 

00:00:09.909 --> 00:00:13.179
 and with complex and heavy software 

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:17.570
 the chips are increasingly decisive the performance of machines 

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:23.829
 in the past week the market received with the news with processors 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.869
 the most efficient check 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.990
 has new processor in the area actually are three new chips 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.150
 two of them are focused on the eyes and Williams for the server market in the 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.830
 case of the novelty servers is the xeon 3400 processors and comes to supply the 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:45.270
 companies with 50 to 100 employees. 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.820
 the product has a low power consumption in addition to performances that the 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.920
 exceptional price for a more affordable price than the 5,000th 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.370
 five hundred years it is a past for servers 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.399
 many accounting firms 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:00.460
 in the company that needs printed initiatives 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.240
 the arena they 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.760
 ah the synop team 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.760
 perhaps late is punished 24% 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.580
 already for the end user two news were announced one of them is the new 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.430
 version of the core i7 the world's fastest processor some changes 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.770
 physics happened in the cores of the 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.579
 Can you get more? 

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:26.829
 reduce energy consumption because you require less of the 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:28.780
 and with that too 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.020
 you provide here the drawing 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.940
 more simplified, more optimized with 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.060
 other components 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.540
 providing a more attractive course for consumers 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.620
 but in practice what this means for you user 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.180
 well the answer is simple with a more simplified architecture 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.770
 ecosystem is also simplified in this way fonts motherboards chipset 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.490
 become the cheapest the 'performance' remains the same luck now costing 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.380
 any less 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.650
 Last but not least we have the launch of the core processor 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.119
 i5 the team's own number we are also talking about a processor tops 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.050
 but with some different characteristics that occur 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.900
 sure it's actually a great choice for anyone who wants a kind of 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.900
 last generation spending less 

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:23.039
 because it is the big difference 35 are correctly 

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:28.029
 the 47 got higher copies so it looks like it has ample with a bit more 

00:02:28.029 --> 00:02:30.239
 low compared to core i7 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.479
 My body in five years did not have to bring 

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:37.589
 who prefers to see that a characteristic that works the capacity 

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:40.019
 processing of each of the rooms 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.809
 then run ect has 4 physical pole cores 

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:49.469
 in eight logical cores in qualifying yesterday 4 among the physique of four dead 

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:52.039
 so when he referred 

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:55.039
 eight heads that the coritiba had the fourth position 

00:02:56.529 --> 00:03:00.069
 is planning on upgrading your machine so if you want the 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.680
 maximum performance and energy savings be sure to search the 

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:07.139
 respect to these two intel core i5 and core i7 processors 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.530
 is today the most modern in terms of processing are already 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.129
 available throughout Brazil and if you want to better understand why I 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:19.069
 I would have considered the best processor on the planet to look 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.799
 digital on the internet next to this report you find a link to 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.420
 another matter that explains just how the new 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.290
 processors represents a leap in speed and efficiency. 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.610
 but what 

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:40.199
