 rousseff the lawsuit does not exist 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:07.570
 how to make it effective once per 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.399
 because if messi every time he catches the ball 

00:00:10.399 --> 00:00:12.099
 they knock it down 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:15.099
 said that the one who took conjugate vaccine 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.210

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.210
 third that I have messi and plasma agribusinesses 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:27.069
 why he did not do it in series 

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:29.079

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:32.180
 I gave him I fight messi he got him head in the door 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.840
 the external web 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.260
 and the ball 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.820
 old inside the ball hits the stick but inside of palisade 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.740
 and from that header experience 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.260
 that you are asked to make exact 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.710
 project I think we are 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.710
 just when 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.620
 we have already proven ourselves 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.970
 that everything is very stressful 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.960
 they were wrong 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.960
 they were wrong a lot 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.760
 it was because 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.760
 although I'm still strong about this 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.900
 a fool or and I think that 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.040
 the same thinks they said that I would speak of Eden an apology to 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.990
 player 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.990
 because we leave everything inside the court because they are professionals 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.750
 I always feel 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.750
 and because I think they're making people happy 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.710

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.710

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.830
 defending the Argentine shirt 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.050
 that the kishimoto at the same time 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.560
 here there was not a before and after 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.780
 these players are always the same 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.020
 who dressed today 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.230
 they were also eliminator can and had some time 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.270
 but I would love that what next seller mouthpiece 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:57.790
 ian apologized 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.939
 I wanted to ask you what is the meaning and is part 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.620
 the cinematographic studio that we are martín palermo false peace i and also 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.430
 he added that there was a little secret before I came in that you told him something martin 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.510
 I was looking, I do not know if I told him that you were going to be there was something that corrupted martí but 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.989
 they will tell me 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:19.269
 to since childhood 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:21.309
 26s was 

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:24.309
 I want to emphasize that everything has been a great match 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:28.039
 I think we're going by name age 

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:31.399
 it does not surprise me for the web it is very respectful total 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.489
 he is a rude man of football 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:40.889
 he has his face his eyes like crazy he clears free credit or is and for 

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:41.449
 what 

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:44.329
 that he had played four five world 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:47.329
 It happens when I put it on and go have fun 

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:54.719
 the court and the pilot influenced so that Argentina can not solve it before the 

00:02:54.719 --> 00:02:56.569
 match 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.209
 unit and that this one I know the street to lend for both 

00:03:03.029 --> 00:03:06.029
 there is a silversmith myth before 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:09.849
 they do not have a foot 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:13.659
 then who will harm if the ball here 

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:18.009
 and it bounces you like the rebounds 

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:21.689
 he came back with the old story 

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:24.779
 pt platini or beckenbauer 

00:03:24.779 --> 00:03:27.979
 a lot of players inside the fifa 

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:31.289
 I would ask him to tell me about Diego Maradona 

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:33.239
 to be fixed a ball said 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:36.079
 a feat that suits the soccer player 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:37.249
 a ball that 

00:03:37.249 --> 00:03:40.089
 that can give them the luxury of going to power 

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:43.089
 I can see the chanfle they want and three of the PSOE is impossible 

00:03:43.929 --> 00:03:47.629
 I personally experienced it in training, he says 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:52.500
 all the squad that has every ten days second suit if you fall 

00:03:53.249 --> 00:03:56.269
 it is impossible to do preventive work and a change of front 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.079
 and the ball has been like that 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:00.509
 city ​​being like this 

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:03.019
 it is impossible to change front 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:06.019
 in this world is not going to move any work I can stop 

00:04:06.929 --> 00:04:10.389
 involved to stop 

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:13.499
