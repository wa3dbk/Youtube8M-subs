00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:11.829 

okay<00:00:10.639> so<00:00:10.700> another<00:00:11.030> one<00:00:11.209> of<00:00:11.299> the<00:00:11.360> questions<00:00:11.719> we

00:00:11.829 --> 00:00:11.839 
okay so another one of the questions we

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:14.320 
okay so another one of the questions we
get<00:00:12.019> is<00:00:12.619> a<00:00:13.070> customer<00:00:13.639> will<00:00:13.789> call<00:00:13.940> in<00:00:14.150> and<00:00:14.179> will

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:14.330 
get is a customer will call in and will

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.630 
get is a customer will call in and will
say<00:00:14.509> my<00:00:14.839> machine<00:00:15.199> runs<00:00:15.589> fine<00:00:15.919> first<00:00:16.369> thing<00:00:16.580> in

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:16.640 
say my machine runs fine first thing in

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.970 
say my machine runs fine first thing in
the<00:00:16.699> morning<00:00:16.910> when<00:00:17.029> I<00:00:17.060> started<00:00:17.419> up<00:00:17.800> maybe<00:00:18.800> it's

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:18.980 
the morning when I started up maybe it's

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.920 
the morning when I started up maybe it's
cold<00:00:19.189> outside<00:00:19.369> or<00:00:19.699> whatever<00:00:19.820> but<00:00:20.150> then<00:00:20.360> after

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:20.930 
cold outside or whatever but then after

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.439 
cold outside or whatever but then after
10<00:00:21.199> or<00:00:21.230> 15<00:00:21.619> minutes<00:00:21.890> of<00:00:22.009> driving<00:00:22.520> it<00:00:22.669> they<00:00:23.239> find

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:23.449 
10 or 15 minutes of driving it they find

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:24.640 
10 or 15 minutes of driving it they find
that<00:00:23.539> it<00:00:23.660> just<00:00:23.840> doesn't<00:00:23.960> want<00:00:24.140> to<00:00:24.199> go<00:00:24.259> forward

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:24.650 
that it just doesn't want to go forward

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.100 
that it just doesn't want to go forward
or<00:00:24.710> backwards<00:00:25.419> can<00:00:26.419> you<00:00:26.509> explain<00:00:26.809> how<00:00:27.079> that

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:27.110 
or backwards can you explain how that

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.859 
or backwards can you explain how that
works<00:00:27.710> and<00:00:28.040> what<00:00:28.279> the<00:00:28.369> problem<00:00:28.669> might<00:00:28.790> be<00:00:28.869> what

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 
works and what the problem might be what

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:33.100 
works and what the problem might be what
happens<00:00:30.439> is<00:00:30.710> as<00:00:30.980> the<00:00:31.279> oil<00:00:31.460> gets<00:00:31.879> warmer<00:00:32.539> the

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
happens is as the oil gets warmer the

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.560 
happens is as the oil gets warmer the
oil<00:00:33.260> gets<00:00:33.590> thinner<00:00:33.980> and<00:00:34.280> if<00:00:34.820> there's<00:00:35.059> some

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
oil gets thinner and if there's some

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.410 
oil gets thinner and if there's some
damage<00:00:36.079> in<00:00:36.260> the<00:00:36.410> system<00:00:36.890> somewhere<00:00:37.219> where<00:00:38.180> oil

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
damage in the system somewhere where oil

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.450 
damage in the system somewhere where oil
is<00:00:38.629> leaking<00:00:38.780> internally<00:00:39.649> the<00:00:39.860> warmer<00:00:40.190> the<00:00:40.309> oil

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
is leaking internally the warmer the oil

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.340 
is leaking internally the warmer the oil
gets<00:00:40.789> the<00:00:41.120> more<00:00:41.300> it<00:00:41.360> leaks<00:00:41.630> internally

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
gets the more it leaks internally

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.440 
gets the more it leaks internally
therefore<00:00:42.860> the<00:00:43.040> less<00:00:43.220> output<00:00:43.520> that<00:00:44.030> component

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450 
therefore the less output that component

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.690 
therefore the less output that component
has<00:00:44.690> and<00:00:45.290> you<00:00:45.650> experience<00:00:46.190> that<00:00:46.370> as<00:00:46.520> less

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:46.700 
has and you experience that as less

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.010 
has and you experience that as less
power<00:00:47.030> or<00:00:47.510> less<00:00:47.720> speed<00:00:48.579> on<00:00:49.579> a<00:00:49.640> drive<00:00:50.450> system

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.020 
power or less speed on a drive system

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.639 
power or less speed on a drive system
this<00:00:51.200> is<00:00:51.440> out<00:00:51.770> of<00:00:51.800> a<00:00:53.110> standard<00:00:54.110> drive<00:00:54.350> pump

inch that's roughly that's a lot of
pressure<00:01:22.520> and<00:01:23.770> there's<00:01:24.770> no<00:01:25.009> rubber<00:01:25.219> seals<00:01:25.609> you

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
pressure and there's no rubber seals you

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.879 
pressure and there's no rubber seals you
rub<00:01:26.299> or<00:01:26.420> seal<00:01:26.659> would<00:01:26.840> blow<00:01:27.139> out<00:01:27.170> under<00:01:27.859> that

00:01:27.879 --> 00:01:27.889 
rub or seal would blow out under that

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:31.330 
rub or seal would blow out under that
speed<00:01:28.459> in<00:01:28.759> that<00:01:28.939> load<00:01:29.209> you<00:01:29.630> can't<00:01:30.229> seal<00:01:30.859> it<00:01:31.039> so

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
speed in that load you can't seal it so

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.910 
speed in that load you can't seal it so
the<00:01:31.850> what<00:01:32.209> the<00:01:32.329> engineers<00:01:32.840> discovered<00:01:33.319> for<00:01:33.740> us

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
the what the engineers discovered for us

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.760 
the what the engineers discovered for us
is<00:01:34.130> they<00:01:34.819> can<00:01:35.029> get<00:01:35.479> these<00:01:35.689> tolerances<00:01:36.049> so

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
is they can get these tolerances so

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.209 
is they can get these tolerances so
close<00:01:37.459> that<00:01:38.329> the<00:01:38.719> oil<00:01:38.899> film<00:01:39.349> is<00:01:39.649> thicker<00:01:40.069> than

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:40.219 
close that the oil film is thicker than

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:43.080 
close that the oil film is thicker than
the<00:01:40.520> tolerances<00:01:41.299> and<00:01:41.539> the<00:01:41.630> oil<00:01:41.810> cannot<00:01:42.380> escape

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
the tolerances and the oil cannot escape

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.459 
the tolerances and the oil cannot escape
through<00:01:44.090> that<00:01:44.299> so<00:01:44.569> that's<00:01:44.779> what<00:01:44.959> you<00:01:45.079> see<00:01:45.289> you

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:45.469 
through that so that's what you see you

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:47.319 
through that so that's what you see you
see<00:01:45.499> this<00:01:45.799> thing<00:01:46.069> spinning<00:01:46.459> on<00:01:46.729> here<00:01:47.119> this<00:01:47.270> is

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:47.329 
see this thing spinning on here this is

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:50.859 
see this thing spinning on here this is
the<00:01:47.630> inside<00:01:47.990> of<00:01:48.020> your<00:01:48.229> drive<00:01:48.529> palm<00:01:49.179> and<00:01:50.179> if<00:01:50.749> you

the inside of your drive palm and if you

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:53.469 
the inside of your drive palm and if you
got<00:01:51.049> somewhere<00:01:52.009> say<00:01:52.399> it<00:01:52.520> got<00:01:52.669> it<00:01:52.789> started<00:01:53.060> dry

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
got somewhere say it got it started dry

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.379 
got somewhere say it got it started dry
sometime<00:01:54.169> say<00:01:54.950> a<00:01:54.979> little<00:01:55.369> bit<00:01:55.549> of<00:01:55.669> dirt<00:01:55.849> got<00:01:56.090> in

00:01:56.379 --> 00:01:56.389 
sometime say a little bit of dirt got in

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:59.349 
sometime say a little bit of dirt got in
it<00:01:56.539> or<00:01:56.719> here's<00:01:56.959> a<00:01:57.020> good<00:01:57.259> one<00:01:57.759> you<00:01:58.759> replaced<00:01:59.179> a

00:01:59.349 --> 00:01:59.359 
it or here's a good one you replaced a

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:02.199 
it or here's a good one you replaced a
hydraulic<00:01:59.929> hose<00:02:00.169> and<00:02:00.679> the<00:02:01.399> person<00:02:01.849> that<00:02:02.029> made

00:02:02.199 --> 00:02:02.209 
hydraulic hose and the person that made

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:05.080 
hydraulic hose and the person that made
the<00:02:02.419> hose<00:02:02.799> didn't<00:02:03.799> wash<00:02:04.069> the<00:02:04.549> little<00:02:04.819> metal

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
the hose didn't wash the little metal

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.969 
the hose didn't wash the little metal
shavings<00:02:05.329> out<00:02:05.689> of<00:02:05.899> it<00:02:06.020> that<00:02:06.200> happened<00:02:06.709> when<00:02:06.889> he

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
shavings out of it that happened when he

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.669 
shavings out of it that happened when he
cut<00:02:07.219> it<00:02:07.399> when<00:02:08.209> he<00:02:08.750> cut<00:02:08.959> it<00:02:09.080> off<00:02:09.200> at<00:02:09.349> the<00:02:09.440> bulk

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
cut it when he cut it off at the bulk

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.010 
cut it when he cut it off at the bulk
reel<00:02:09.950> to<00:02:10.310> make<00:02:10.489> the<00:02:10.670> hose<00:02:10.849> those<00:02:11.630> little<00:02:11.900> metal

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
reel to make the hose those little metal

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.350

little bit of wear looks like and you

be<00:03:49.760> okay<00:03:49.940> we<00:03:50.450> get<00:03:50.600> that<00:03:50.660> question

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
be okay we get that question

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.819 
be okay we get that question
occasionally<00:03:52.100> as<00:03:52.220> well<00:03:52.459> I<00:03:53.359> redid<00:03:54.079> my<00:03:54.140> pump<00:03:54.590> I

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:54.829 
occasionally as well I redid my pump I

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:56.680 
occasionally as well I redid my pump I
used<00:03:55.010> some<00:03:55.280> of<00:03:55.310> your<00:03:55.430> parts<00:03:55.970> everything<00:03:56.480> look

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
used some of your parts everything look

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.630 
used some of your parts everything look
good<00:03:56.720> I<00:03:56.930> put<00:03:57.290> it<00:03:57.440> back<00:03:57.590> together<00:03:57.739> it's<00:03:58.340> still

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
good I put it back together it's still

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.620 
good I put it back together it's still
not<00:03:58.790> working<00:03:59.150> right

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
not working right

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.229 
not working right
but<00:04:00.410> once<00:04:00.709> we<00:04:00.920> look<00:04:01.100> at<00:04:01.310> it<00:04:01.459> we<00:04:01.579> can<00:04:01.760> explain

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
but once we look at it we can explain

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:05.289 
but once we look at it we can explain
that<00:04:02.630> those<00:04:03.100> tolerances<00:04:04.100> are<00:04:04.489> so<00:04:04.940> much

00:04:05.289 --> 00:04:05.299 
that those tolerances are so much

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:08.979 
that those tolerances are so much
tighter<00:04:05.870> than<00:04:06.109> anything<00:04:07.090> else<00:04:08.090> in<00:04:08.600> the

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:08.989 
tighter than anything else in the

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:11.590 
tighter than anything else in the
mechanical<00:04:09.680> industry<00:04:10.010> that<00:04:10.609> it<00:04:11.120> might<00:04:11.390> look

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
mechanical industry that it might look

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.890 
mechanical industry that it might look
good<00:04:11.840> and<00:04:12.140> you'll<00:04:12.410> be<00:04:12.560> junk
