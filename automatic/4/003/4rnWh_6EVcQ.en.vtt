00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:11.400
 disconnect the washing machine from the outlet 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:13.049
 before working on it open the panel 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.279
 higher 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:19.230
 remove the front panel 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:21.630
 leaning the washing machine against the wall and 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.720
 make sure it will not fall 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:30.630
 on top move the engine 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.630
 and disconnect these two wires 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:42.340
 make a bridge wire like this 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:47.280
 with this the wire of the bridge between 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.280
 two wires and put insulating tape 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:55.930
 lower the washing machine and treat it in the cycle 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:58.329
 of centrifugation if the engine works well 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.970
 with the bridge wire 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:03.550
 then the overload switch 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:06.250
 the engine is bad and you have to 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:09.040
 replace the engine I do not think you can 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.710
 get the switch only if the 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.409
 engine does not run with the bridge wire 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.630
 instead of the surcharge switch the 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:17.950
 problem can be in another piece in the 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.950
 motor circuit 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:24.490
 you have to check the engine to see 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.890
 if it runs or not do not continue running the 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.789
 washing machine with the bridge wire since 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.789
 it is dangerous 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.780
 disconnect the two wires from 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.780
 switch 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.210
 put a multimeter on the scale more 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.970
 low to read together 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:51.570
 everything is a reading between the two 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.730
 switch terminals the multimeter 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:58.180
 from bel-air close to zero or less 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:02:02.320
 if you read infinity the switch is bad 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:05.110
 and you have to replace the engine 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.900
 if this video helps you fix your 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:11.380
 washing machine and you can make a small 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:14.050
 donation to help me produce more 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.880
 videos in Spanish I will be very 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.459
 grateful
