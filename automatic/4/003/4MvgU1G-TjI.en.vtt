once<00:00:07.410> you<00:00:07.560> get<00:00:07.740> your<00:00:08.010> your<00:00:08.820> post<00:00:09.090> layout<00:00:09.360> mark

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
once you get your your post layout mark

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.049 
once you get your your post layout mark
I<00:00:09.960> would<00:00:10.080> mark<00:00:10.290> out<00:00:10.500> this<00:00:11.250> is<00:00:11.400> going<00:00:11.549> to<00:00:11.639> be<00:00:11.760> for

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
I would mark out this is going to be for

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.390 
I would mark out this is going to be for
an<00:00:12.180> 80<00:00:12.389> inch<00:00:12.600> post<00:00:12.960> so<00:00:13.350> I'd<00:00:13.469> mark<00:00:13.710> out<00:00:13.889> 8<00:00:14.100> inches

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
an 80 inch post so I'd mark out 8 inches

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.730 
an 80 inch post so I'd mark out 8 inches
all<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:14.639> way<00:00:14.789> around<00:00:15.270> so<00:00:15.510> that<00:00:15.660> you're<00:00:15.900> inside

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
all the way around so that you're inside

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.580 
all the way around so that you're inside
and<00:00:16.949> outside<00:00:17.130> posts<00:00:17.880> are<00:00:18.060> marked<00:00:18.480> out<00:00:18.660> then<00:00:19.440> we

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
and outside posts are marked out then we

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.080 
and outside posts are marked out then we
would<00:00:19.710> take<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.539> steel<00:00:21.539> or<00:00:21.930> in<00:00:22.380> some<00:00:23.160> cases<00:00:23.430> an

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
would take the steel or in some cases an

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.540 
would take the steel or in some cases an
aluminum<00:00:24.630> knife<00:00:24.810> plate<00:00:25.170> these<00:00:25.980> ones<00:00:26.160> are<00:00:26.220> 100%

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
aluminum knife plate these ones are 100%

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.930 
aluminum knife plate these ones are 100%
aluminum<00:00:27.210> is<00:00:27.740> typically<00:00:28.740> what<00:00:29.039> we<00:00:29.160> use<00:00:29.400> in

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:29.940 
aluminum is typically what we use in

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.869 
aluminum is typically what we use in
some<00:00:30.270> cases<00:00:30.570> we'll<00:00:31.110> need<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.440> use<00:00:31.500> the

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:31.879 
some cases we'll need to use the

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:35.750 
some cases we'll need to use the
structural<00:00:32.879> steel<00:00:33.200> and<00:00:34.280> you'll<00:00:35.280> end<00:00:35.460> up<00:00:35.520> just

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
structural steel and you'll end up just

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.810 
structural steel and you'll end up just
Center<00:00:36.059> in<00:00:36.180> it<00:00:36.360> centering<00:00:36.960> it<00:00:37.079> in<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.559> in<00:00:37.829> post

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
Center in it centering it in the in post

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.690 
Center in it centering it in the in post
layout<00:00:39.300> mark<00:00:39.570> then<00:00:40.320> you<00:00:40.500> can<00:00:40.680> begin<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.430> mark

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
layout mark then you can begin to mark

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.900 
layout mark then you can begin to mark
for<00:00:42.630> your<00:00:42.810> for<00:00:43.739> your<00:00:43.770> post<00:00:44.070> here<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:44.579> then

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
for your for your post here and then

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.540 
for your for your post here and then
eventually<00:00:45.180> put<00:00:45.660> your<00:00:45.810> two<00:00:46.550> redheads

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
eventually put your two redheads

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.700 
eventually put your two redheads
concrete<00:00:48.480> bolts<00:00:48.750> either<00:00:48.989> put<00:00:49.649> them

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
concrete bolts either put them

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.120 
concrete bolts either put them
kitty-corner<00:00:50.190> or<00:00:51.090> in<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.230> case<00:00:52.410> like<00:00:52.620> this<00:00:52.680> I

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:53.130 
kitty-corner or in a case like this I

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.190 
kitty-corner or in a case like this I
would<00:00:53.280> put<00:00:53.460> them<00:00:53.550> here<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:53.970> here<00:00:54.750> so<00:00:54.780> we're

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:55.200 
would put them here and here so we're

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.420 
would put them here and here so we're
not<00:00:55.320> doing<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:55.680> on<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.890> corner<00:00:56.250> of<00:00:56.280> the

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
not doing it on the corner of the

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.840 
not doing it on the corner of the
concrete<00:00:56.880> here<00:00:57.059> so<00:00:58.309> once<00:00:59.309> you've<00:00:59.489> got<00:00:59.670> all

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
concrete here so once you've got all

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.600 
concrete here so once you've got all
four<00:01:00.149> posts<00:01:00.360> laid<00:01:00.960> out<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:02.130> next<00:01:02.460> thing

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610 
four posts laid out the next thing

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.209 
four posts laid out the next thing
you'll<00:01:02.760> want<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:03.059> do<00:01:03.300> is<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.630> get<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.809> height<00:01:04.219> for

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:05.219 
you'll want to do is to get a height for

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:07.219 
you'll want to do is to get a height for
each<00:01:05.460> post<00:01:05.820> because<00:01:06.329> your<00:01:06.450> concrete<00:01:06.990> is<00:01:07.110> going

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
each post because your concrete is going

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.340 
each post because your concrete is going
to<00:01:07.350> have<00:01:07.560> some<00:01:08.070> slope<00:01:08.509> so<00:01:09.509> we've<00:01:09.689> set<00:01:09.930> up<00:01:09.960> the

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
to have some slope so we've set up the

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.919 
to have some slope so we've set up the
laser<00:01:10.950> here<00:01:11.280> on<00:01:11.459> one<00:01:11.670> corner<00:01:11.999> we're<00:01:12.749> going<00:01:12.780> to

00:01:12.919 --> 00:01:12.929 
laser here on one corner we're going to

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:16.239 
laser here on one corner we're going to
shoot<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.530> use<00:01:13.679> that<00:01:13.950> corner<00:01:14.429> as<00:01:14.609> zero<00:01:15.600> and

00:01:16.239 --> 00:01:16.249 
shoot and use that corner as zero and

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:23.370 
shoot and use that corner as zero and
shoot<00:01:17.249> each<00:01:17.490> post<00:01:17.819> and<00:01:17.999> get<00:01:18.149> a<00:01:18.209> height<00:01:18.420> so

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.950 

we'll<00:01:23.980> see<00:01:24.220> where<00:01:24.430> the<00:01:24.610> where<00:01:25.330> the<00:01:25.360> laser<00:01:25.659> is

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
we'll see where the where the laser is

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.680 
we'll see where the where the laser is
there<00:01:26.290> and<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:27.700> it<00:01:27.850> will<00:01:27.909> go<00:01:28.090> through<00:01:28.120> and

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
there and and it will go through and

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.350 
there and and it will go through and
shoot<00:01:29.350> the<00:01:29.500> heights<00:01:29.710> for<00:01:29.860> each<00:01:30.100> post<00:01:30.460> here

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
shoot the heights for each post here

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.680 
shoot the heights for each post here
we've<00:01:31.600> created<00:01:31.930> a<00:01:32.320> little<00:01:33.160> map<00:01:33.460> of<00:01:33.490> where<00:01:34.450> and

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:34.690 
we've created a little map of where and

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.960 
we've created a little map of where and
numbered<00:01:35.500> we're<00:01:35.950> going<00:01:36.070> to<00:01:36.130> number<00:01:36.310> each<00:01:36.640> post

plate exactly where it's going to sit

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.380 
plate exactly where it's going to sit
and<00:02:56.320> stand<00:02:57.070> on<00:02:57.340> the<00:02:57.460> corner<00:02:57.640> so<00:02:58.000> it<00:02:58.090> doesn't

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
and stand on the corner so it doesn't

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:06.340

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:11.090 

so<00:03:07.350> we<00:03:07.440> get<00:03:07.620> to<00:03:08.750> the<00:03:09.750> holes<00:03:09.959> drilled<00:03:10.350> and<00:03:10.590> then

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
so we get to the holes drilled and then

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.370 
so we get to the holes drilled and then
we'll<00:03:11.280> be<00:03:11.400> able<00:03:11.459> to<00:03:11.760> to<00:03:12.600> just<00:03:12.810> go<00:03:12.930> ahead<00:03:13.050> and

we'll be able to to just go ahead and
pound<00:03:13.620> these<00:03:13.830> down<00:03:14.069> in<00:03:14.360> to<00:03:15.360> where<00:03:15.450> they're
