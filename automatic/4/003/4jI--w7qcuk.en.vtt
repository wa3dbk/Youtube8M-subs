00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
PS microphone so let's take a look at

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.370 
PS microphone so let's take a look at
the<00:00:25.440> specs<00:00:25.770> of<00:00:25.980> this<00:00:26.310> microphone<00:00:26.790> right<00:00:27.270> now

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:27.380 
the specs of this microphone right now

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.130 
the specs of this microphone right now
okay<00:00:28.380> so<00:00:28.770> this<00:00:29.010> is<00:00:29.280> a<00:00:29.310> super<00:00:29.940> cardioid<00:00:30.539> pickup

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
okay so this is a super cardioid pickup

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.229 
okay so this is a super cardioid pickup
pattern<00:00:31.380> you<00:00:32.250> know<00:00:32.340> what<00:00:32.489> that<00:00:32.669> means<00:00:32.940> it's

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
pattern you know what that means it's

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.130 
pattern you know what that means it's
basically<00:00:33.589> cardioid<00:00:34.640> super<00:00:35.640> fine<00:00:36.239> if<00:00:36.749> you<00:00:36.960> get

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
basically cardioid super fine if you get

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.899 
basically cardioid super fine if you get
what<00:00:37.289> I'm<00:00:37.409> saying<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:38.100> that<00:00:38.460> means<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.760> pick

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:38.909 
what I'm saying and that means to pick

00:00:38.909 --> 00:00:41.020 
what I'm saying and that means to pick
up<00:00:39.059> patterns<00:00:39.239> even<00:00:39.719> more<00:00:39.960> narrow<00:00:40.319> than

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
up patterns even more narrow than

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.399 
up patterns even more narrow than
cardioid<00:00:42.030> so<00:00:42.269> it<00:00:42.449> only<00:00:42.569> picks<00:00:42.839> up<00:00:43.050> sound<00:00:43.319> from

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:43.409 
cardioid so it only picks up sound from

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:44.660 
cardioid so it only picks up sound from
the<00:00:43.620> front<00:00:43.920> that's<00:00:44.069> what<00:00:44.159> a<00:00:44.280> shotgun

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
the front that's what a shotgun

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.549 
the front that's what a shotgun
microphone<00:00:44.999> is<00:00:45.359> supposed<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.839> be<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.289> then

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
microphone is supposed to be and then

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.979 
microphone is supposed to be and then
it's<00:00:47.159> also<00:00:47.399> got<00:00:47.640> its<00:00:47.819> high<00:00:47.940> pass<00:00:48.210> filter<00:00:48.690> 10

really<00:01:10.860> picky<00:01:11.250> maybe<00:01:11.550> it<00:01:11.790> didn't<00:01:12.270> but<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:12.810> think

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
really picky maybe it didn't but I think

you know panniers the on and off switch

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:04.890 
you know panniers the on and off switch
there<00:03:03.489> should<00:03:03.730> be<00:03:03.880> a<00:03:03.910> light<00:03:04.180> that<00:03:04.390> comes<00:03:04.630> on

there should be a light that comes on

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.500 
there should be a light that comes on
and<00:03:05.260> this<00:03:05.769> is<00:03:05.829> how<00:03:05.950> you<00:03:06.130> connect<00:03:06.670> the<00:03:06.880> 3.5

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
and this is how you connect the 3.5

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.440 
and this is how you connect the 3.5
millimeter<00:03:08.019> stereo<00:03:08.440> jack<00:03:09.040> you<00:03:09.340> just<00:03:09.730> keep

millimeter stereo jack you just keep

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.660 
millimeter stereo jack you just keep
spinning<00:03:11.170> it<00:03:11.440> I'm<00:03:11.890> gonna<00:03:12.040> skip<00:03:12.370> through<00:03:12.579> that

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
spinning it I'm gonna skip through that

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.640 
spinning it I'm gonna skip through that
and<00:03:13.090> then<00:03:13.239> this<00:03:13.390> would<00:03:13.599> plug<00:03:13.780> into<00:03:13.930> your<00:03:14.110> DSLR

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650
