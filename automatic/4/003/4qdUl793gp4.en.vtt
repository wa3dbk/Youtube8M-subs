00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
I feel like if this is fitted correctly

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.100 
I feel like if this is fitted correctly
and<00:01:26.520> then<00:01:26.670> your<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.450> rest<00:01:27.570> of<00:01:27.720> your<00:01:27.810> blanks

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
and then your the rest of your blanks

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.469 
and then your the rest of your blanks
are<00:01:28.229> cut<00:01:28.409> from<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.619> same<00:01:28.860> piece<00:01:29.240> they're<00:01:30.240> not

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
are cut from the same piece they're not

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.149 
are cut from the same piece they're not
going<00:01:30.810> it's<00:01:31.079> not<00:01:31.259> going<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.470> move<00:01:31.619> as<00:01:31.829> much<00:01:31.979> as

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
going it's not going to move as much as

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.920 
going it's not going to move as much as
you<00:01:32.280> think<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:33.090> doesn't<00:01:33.329> really<00:01:33.450> need<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.659> go

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
you think it doesn't really need to go

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.350 
you think it doesn't really need to go
side<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.140> side<00:01:34.229> so<00:01:34.650> I<00:01:35.130> just<00:01:35.549> left<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:35.909> as<00:01:36.060> a

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
side to side so I just left it as a

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.770 
side to side so I just left it as a
straight<00:01:36.900> up<00:01:37.250> butt<00:01:38.250> joint<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:39.270> it<00:01:39.390> slides<00:01:39.600> in

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
straight up butt joint and it slides in

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.109 
straight up butt joint and it slides in
pretty<00:01:40.020> well<00:01:40.200> I<00:01:40.409> went<00:01:41.070> ahead<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.369> cut<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.820> few

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
pretty well I went ahead and cut a few

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.149 
pretty well I went ahead and cut a few
more<00:01:42.299> pieces<00:01:42.570> like<00:01:42.869> this<00:01:42.990> so<00:01:43.229> so<00:01:43.710> that<00:01:43.890> I<00:01:43.920> could

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
more pieces like this so so that I could

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.069 
more pieces like this so so that I could
you<00:01:44.759> know<00:01:44.820> swing<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.210> back<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.540> forth<00:01:45.780> I<00:01:45.930> mean

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
you know swing it back and forth I mean

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.530 
you know swing it back and forth I mean
use<00:01:46.320> up<00:01:46.530> this<00:01:47.369> space<00:01:47.610> here<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.090> then<00:01:48.210> flip

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
use up this space here and then flip

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.210 
use up this space here and then flip
this<00:01:48.720> around<00:01:48.840> as<00:01:49.259> well<00:01:49.409> then<00:01:49.649> use<00:01:49.829> up<00:01:50.040> the

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
this around as well then use up the

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.130 
this around as well then use up the
sacrificial<00:01:50.850> piece<00:01:51.000> before<00:01:51.270> replacing<00:01:51.810> it

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
sacrificial piece before replacing it

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.170 
sacrificial piece before replacing it
and<00:01:52.950> then<00:01:53.159> a<00:01:53.189> B<00:01:53.369> because<00:01:53.790> this<00:01:53.880> is<00:01:54.030> just

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
and then a B because this is just

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.289 
and then a B because this is just
quarter-inch<00:01:54.630> Baltic<00:01:54.960> birch<00:01:55.110> so<00:01:55.579> also<00:01:56.579> I

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299
