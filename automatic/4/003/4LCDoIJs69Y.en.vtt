00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:07.330
 so if the idea of ​​preparing a surface 

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:09.070
 for a renovation is much 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.629
 to be bored where you set that today 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.759
 in the company of martin good point which is 

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:14.980
 a specialist in equipment in 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:16.359
 martin tooling hello you have 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.460
 a lot of calls here his equipment 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:20.260
 his valets I presume to provide 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.320
 equipment when we want to prepare a 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:25.119
 surface to affix something there 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.050
 new and there are all the tools that 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.679
 exist on the market 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.480
 for sure it is not if we attack 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:33.760
 well first let's talk about surfers in 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:37.510
 come in wood if I'm going to remove the 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.340
 prelate in the direction yes we have one 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.170
 machine that can do pretty much 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.270
 all the work obviously people get 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.879
 always ask what to use they 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:49.180
 think forced one is a recent small 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:51.280
 who avoids a lot of effort 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.989
 the tile stripper here of ecology 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.570
 after the art of rapeseed oil rapeseed 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:58.120
 carpet and even the stripper to 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:01.180
 parquet flooring presses on the coming 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:04.360
 accessories when we changed everything 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.780
 simply here in 203 screws with a wrench 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.450
 allen 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.490
 I need it here we see this kind 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.220
 different functions I imagine yes 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:15.520
 this one is one for carpets on 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.170
 has a little more here that allows 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.540
 to remove the lines their scrums near 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.010
 the race and mike goes ripping on the 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.690
 sides what makes are even more 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.370
 easy and less defend bias 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.410
 and then we even have the knives to 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.870
 parquet flooring that allow to come 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:31.360
 remove the floors but also the 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:33.640
 tiles tva the coatings more rigid come 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.620
 there is a cutting angle that we are going 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.600
 use if we are on concrete or a 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.420
 cutting angle that we will use if we 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.910
 is on the good order have believed good and healthy 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.740
 according to sana at the end of this machine that 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.660
 who will simply touch with 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.140
 slight vibrations that will go do the 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.700
 job 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.890
 yes customers who call us on 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.440
 often think that they will force as 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.050
 I said earlier and then we walked 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.120
 pautrel at the back of the machine while 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.740
 just wonder light pressure that 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.300
 scares a lot of people 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.300
 material that resists this machine 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.490
 sink works I see a tool here that is 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.470
 a little more spectacular we did not 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.810
 nothing to see a kind of barrels 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.790
 dimitra is something special 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.350
 is for the ceramics the party is 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.150
 exactly this is called the 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:17.740
 ceramic knife since a few 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.500
 years of people who takes more and 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.420
 more the ground but even the 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.920
 renovation contractors a 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.690
 do not know all this machinery 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.670
 once they have used his sales 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.110
 to do without it 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.480
 definitely it's still a tool that 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.100
 allows few effects removed enough 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.280
 quickly it's just a 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:39.970
 knife more or less sharp that we will 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:42.100
 fit on a percussion drill and 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.920
 instead of persists hammer demolition 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.690
 we speak and that as well does enough 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.990
 quickly here with a little leader 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:53.070
 that's plenty here and then it's 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:55.750
 to use by tilting slightly and 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.490
 in the ceramic joint or even 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.320
 on ceramics if it takes because the 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.240
 hammer a pretty strong enough power 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.680
 of the bench of the queen abla it is for 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.620
 able to pull out just about anywhere 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.630
 what else here on a come on the concrete 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.980
 it's even faster then perfect 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.300
 once we took two turns like 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.980
 we say here it's very good work 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.870
 for in town and the famous big ones 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.340
 this is the year when we have the exchanged have 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.410
 always very surprised customers who 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.420
 he would have grabbed a tool to 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.970
 do this work there but here it's 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.739
 quite exceptional what I have under the 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:27.280
 eyes that we show to our viewers 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:29.650
 it's a kind of what we 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.800
 call the diamond pad yes for a 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.550
 the times if the school very hard on the 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.980
 concrete floors 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:38.230
 we made ourselves exclusively 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.790
 for concrete surfaces very often 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.850
 the people who will put the ceramics 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:45.370
 the kind friends that require more concrete 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:47.709
 or less rough without peeling paint 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.900
 chick and epoxy so you have to remove 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:51.760
 his milk is something very hard 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.650
 it's with diamond panels as well 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.420
 that will be used on a police 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.489
 throw here behind us paul ceuzin 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.810
 little bit special an enemy force on 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.400
 can put weights to go 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.810
 look deeper to put a lot 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.400
 more weight on the machine to go 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.580
 really go get all that 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.230
 wants to go off as residues of 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.720
 investors was important precisely 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.640
 when we prepare a surface as much with 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.640
 this machine there that the offer has been shown 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:18.010
 for the morning ceramics everything has to be 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.290
 be clean and smooth because the future 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.630
 porsche coming 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.150
 good to enjoy others it's for the purpose 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.490
 adhere either the tile or the 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.500
 next polar a surface that is very 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.970
 clean for this is clean 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.040
 we have to take the tool off 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.900
 why here in earning us without 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:41.250
 problem in everything you need thanks
