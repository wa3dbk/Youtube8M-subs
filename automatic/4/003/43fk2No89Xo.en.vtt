00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
as the spacing the numbers and things

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.460 
as the spacing the numbers and things
like<00:01:02.010> that<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:03.329> location<00:01:03.960> of<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.199> as<00:01:04.320> well

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
like that and the location of it as well

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.990 
like that and the location of it as well
that<00:01:04.500> that's<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.070> big<00:01:05.250> deal<00:01:05.280> so<00:01:05.640> folks<00:01:05.820> what<00:01:05.970> I

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
that that's a big deal so folks what I

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
that that's a big deal so folks what I
think<00:01:06.210> Apple<00:01:06.420> is<00:01:06.479> doing<00:01:06.570> is<00:01:06.750> they're<00:01:06.840> just

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
think Apple is doing is they're just

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.929 
think Apple is doing is they're just
taking<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.320> current<00:01:07.680> notification<00:01:08.549> system<00:01:08.820> if

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
taking a current notification system if

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.310 
taking a current notification system if
you<00:01:09.030> want<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.240> call<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.510> that<00:01:09.540> things<00:01:10.110> for<00:01:10.260> like

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
you want to call it that things for like

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.500 
you want to call it that things for like
personal<00:01:10.710> hotspot<00:01:10.860> etc<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:11.820> they're<00:01:12.360> just

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
personal hotspot etc and they're just

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.390 
personal hotspot etc and they're just
applying<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:13.080> you<00:01:13.560> know<00:01:13.680> for<00:01:14.280> the

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
applying it you know for the

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.340 
applying it you know for the
notifications<00:01:14.939> in<00:01:15.090> general<00:01:15.540> so<00:01:16.110> it's<00:01:16.259> just

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
notifications in general so it's just

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.260 
notifications in general so it's just
gonna<00:01:16.530> be<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.830> new<00:01:17.009> notification<00:01:17.640> system<00:01:18.030> is

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
gonna be the new notification system is

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.820 
gonna be the new notification system is
kind<00:01:18.780> of<00:01:18.810> what<00:01:18.960> we're<00:01:19.049> already<00:01:19.200> used<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.710> and

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
kind of what we're already used to and

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.260 
kind of what we're already used to and
that's<00:01:19.950> kind<00:01:20.159> of<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.310> good<00:01:20.400> thing<00:01:20.640> because<00:01:20.820> it's

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
that's kind of a good thing because it's

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.880 
that's kind of a good thing because it's
not<00:01:21.479> gonna<00:01:21.600> be<00:01:21.810> this<00:01:22.020> huge<00:01:22.229> learning<00:01:22.560> curve

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
not gonna be this huge learning curve

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.370 
not gonna be this huge learning curve
that<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:23.189> lot<00:01:23.430> of<00:01:23.460> folks<00:01:23.869> need<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:25.080> adapt<00:01:25.350> to

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
that a lot of folks need to adapt to

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.649 
that a lot of folks need to adapt to
that's<00:01:26.070> what<00:01:26.280> I<00:01:26.310> think<00:01:26.729> I<00:01:26.909> think<00:01:27.180> this<00:01:27.390> is

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
that's what I think I think this is

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.510 
that's what I think I think this is
indeed<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.229> real<00:01:28.380> deal<00:01:28.650> some<00:01:29.189> people<00:01:29.400> are

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
indeed the real deal some people are

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.510 
indeed the real deal some people are
skeptical<00:01:29.790> about<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.240> font<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.689> whatnot<00:01:31.020> of

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
skeptical about the font and whatnot of

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.890 
skeptical about the font and whatnot of
the<00:01:32.520> notification<00:01:33.180> but<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:33.390> think<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.689> font

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
the notification but I think that font

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.450 
the notification but I think that font
matches<00:01:34.200> up<00:01:34.350> what<00:01:34.500> Apple's<00:01:34.860> done<00:01:35.040> in<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.250> past

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
matches up what Apple's done in the past

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.429 
matches up what Apple's done in the past
I<00:01:35.759> mean<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:36.000> looks<00:01:36.210> pretty<00:01:36.840> much<00:01:36.930> spot-on<00:01:37.290> with

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
I mean it looks pretty much spot-on with

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.499 
I mean it looks pretty much spot-on with
the<00:01:37.680> personal<00:01:38.009> hotspot<00:01:38.189> font<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:39.240> know<00:01:39.329> when

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
the personal hotspot font you know when

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:40.399 
the personal hotspot font you know when
you<00:01:39.570> get<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.720> notification<00:01:40.229> for<00:01:40.259> the

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
you get the notification for the

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.260 
you get the notification for the
personal<00:01:40.770> hotspot<00:01:40.920> so<00:01:41.640> folks<00:01:41.820> we'll<00:01:42.000> see<00:01:42.119> in<00:01:42.210> a

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
personal hotspot so folks we'll see in a

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.580
