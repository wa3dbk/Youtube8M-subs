right so you would see in this top

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:38.599 
right so you would see in this top
right-hand<00:00:36.030> corner<00:00:36.739> that<00:00:37.739> would<00:00:37.920> be<00:00:38.070> update

00:00:38.599 --> 00:00:38.609

00:00:43.189 --> 00:00:43.199 
there's 12 you'd see 12 in brackets if

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:46.400 
there's 12 you'd see 12 in brackets if
there's<00:00:43.379> 25<00:00:43.829> years<00:00:44.070> or<00:00:44.160> 25<00:00:44.609> in<00:00:44.760> brackets<00:00:45.410> right

which was the figure that I had to
update<00:02:45.959> and<00:02:46.959> it<00:02:47.050> was<00:02:47.200> just<00:02:47.380> kind<00:02:47.650> of<00:02:48.090> baffling

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
update and it was just kind of baffling

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.390 
update and it was just kind of baffling
me<00:02:49.209> when<00:02:49.330> I<00:02:49.360> came<00:02:49.630> to<00:02:49.870> it<00:02:49.900> that<00:02:50.200> what<00:02:50.980> why<00:02:51.220> was

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
me when I came to it that what why was

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.430 
me when I came to it that what why was
it<00:02:51.519> downloading<00:02:52.180> installing<00:02:52.510> them<00:02:53.140> and

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
it downloading installing them and

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.590 
it downloading installing them and
everything<00:02:53.890> seemed<00:02:54.310> fine<00:02:54.400> and<00:02:54.970> then<00:02:55.120> towards

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
everything seemed fine and then towards

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.449 
everything seemed fine and then towards
the<00:02:55.660> end<00:02:55.720> it<00:02:56.049> would<00:02:56.110> come<00:02:56.410> up<00:02:56.440> no<00:02:56.739> license<00:02:57.310> he

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
the end it would come up no license he

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.490 
the end it would come up no license he
well<00:02:58.120> he<00:02:58.269> wouldn't<00:02:58.420> comp<00:02:58.660> no<00:02:58.810> license<00:02:59.230> geeks

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
well he wouldn't comp no license geeks

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.920 
well he wouldn't comp no license geeks
if<00:02:59.709> he<00:02:59.769> came<00:02:59.980> up<00:03:00.130> that<00:03:00.310> I<00:03:00.340> think<00:03:00.670> God<00:03:00.930> we've

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
if he came up that I think God we've

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.080 
if he came up that I think God we've
understood<00:03:02.230> straight<00:03:03.040> away<00:03:03.280> that<00:03:03.310> someone's

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
understood straight away that someone's

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.449 
understood straight away that someone's
going<00:03:04.239> on<00:03:04.540> but<00:03:04.780> I<00:03:04.989> kind<00:03:05.769> of<00:03:05.890> like<00:03:06.100> I<00:03:06.130> must've

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
going on but I kind of like I must've

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.720 
going on but I kind of like I must've
tried<00:03:06.910> to<00:03:07.120> update<00:03:07.269> about<00:03:07.750> three<00:03:08.319> times<00:03:08.590> but<00:03:09.400> I

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
tried to update about three times but I

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.000 
tried to update about three times but I
kept<00:03:10.630> currently<00:03:10.989> there<00:03:11.140> is<00:03:11.170> so<00:03:11.470> then<00:03:11.620> I<00:03:11.709> I've

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
kept currently there is so then I I've

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.680 
kept currently there is so then I I've
must<00:03:12.280> I<00:03:12.430> think<00:03:12.910> I<00:03:13.030> just<00:03:13.060> come<00:03:13.360> and<00:03:13.450> look<00:03:13.540> at
