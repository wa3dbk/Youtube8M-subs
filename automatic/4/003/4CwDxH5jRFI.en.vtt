00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.450

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.980
 Hello dear friends, we are about 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.170
 joker and in this video i will tell you how 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.270
 you can become a ghost 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.970
 right in the hangar do not need to go anywhere and 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.010
 something complicated doing everything is very easy and 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.350
 just and so in order to become 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.530
 ghost we need two accounts 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.200
 one left and the other is your main and so 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.090
 To demonstrate this, I propose 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.640
 we all go to any destination on 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:01.710
 random training room so 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:04.410
 starting to search on the server ru1 in sims 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:08.070
 no no no I don't want anything sims ii 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:11.160

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:18.090

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:20.250
 time guys are fine fine so guys 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.100
 as you saw me do now do 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.550
 these four transformations and now we will 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.280
 all troll so now we are 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:32.009
 on my account and let's check everything 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.330
 is okay as you hear already heard 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.539

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.679
 training room or check for 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:40.960
 I can hear 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:51.490
 and I 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:58.659

00:01:51.490 --> 00:02:01.780

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:22.900
 I'm in my hangar I'm not even on 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:25.330
 I can do my ghost but 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.000
 how do you hear guys just fucking 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:29.220
 do not understand what is happening and it seems to me 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.450
 produced 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:36.070
 I can not see now training 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:38.380
 try to add me to the ignore room 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:41.260
 or remove from workout 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:50.560
 try to do with me how are we 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:52.510

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:59.799
 all the burn guys do not understand what 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:03:02.620
 about the features of seconds and now 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:05.350
 some info about the bug and so this bug 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.600
 can do like fortifications in 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:10.360
 training room in team battles 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:13.090
 on the global map I mean on 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:15.910
 landing in special battles in platoon 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.100
 general wherever possible this bug everywhere 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.530
 works to do this to you 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.260
 will need two accounts one left one 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.030
 Unfortunately, I donâ€™t show my main 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.670
 I can because it is a direct violation 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.739
 the rules can not just for the bath 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.650
 Yes, and in principle, I will show how it is 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.880
 do will start in tanks full 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.830
 Apocalypse 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:39.550
 it works now at 0 9 at 0 9 209 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:42.190
 1090 worked 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.200
 I hope she will also work 94 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.420
 the most interesting thing you can't 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.450
 add to ignore you can not be excluded 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.430
 from a company fight for example overwhelm you and 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.010
 so on in general you can sit and 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.390
 troll you for it absolutely nothing 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.480
 will be the only one you can shabbyat 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.950
 ban for breaking the rules of the game 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.500
 show how to do it I can not 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.420
 because they can simply ban me 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.490
 so before you nickname player who 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.530
 I showed it to you, thank you very much 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:09.310

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.960
 rest 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.940
 if you want to know how to do that 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.760
 write to him in a personal but with you 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:18.280

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.900

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.540
 mocking but with you was about the joker and 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:28.770
