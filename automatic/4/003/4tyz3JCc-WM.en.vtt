00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.120
 any sense of these laments in 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.650
 which I usually indulge

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.390
 cannet the whole body brought back by the 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.310
 the flames of the years the one who fashion them 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.660

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.330
 without even wanting to believe what I 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.330
 holds back that of despair 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.580
 louis of despair 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.250
