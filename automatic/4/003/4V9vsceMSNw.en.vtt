00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:13.939 
there usually works a little better than

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:18.039 
there usually works a little better than
that<00:01:14.770> if<00:01:15.770> I<00:01:15.979> forget<00:01:16.159> to<00:01:16.399> pick<00:01:16.579> it<00:01:16.700> up<00:01:16.850> I<00:01:17.119> go<00:01:17.960> to

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:18.049 
that if I forget to pick it up I go to

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:21.010 
that if I forget to pick it up I go to
Walmart<00:01:18.289> or<00:01:19.479> autozone<00:01:20.479> and<00:01:20.659> pick<00:01:20.810> something

Walmart or autozone and pick something
it<00:01:21.229> up<00:01:21.350> but<00:01:21.649> it<00:01:21.950> works<00:01:22.159> just<00:01:22.369> as<00:01:22.520> good<00:01:22.549> as<00:01:22.819> the

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
it up but it works just as good as the

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.590 
it up but it works just as good as the
other<00:01:23.030> stuff<00:01:23.560> but<00:01:24.560> um<00:01:24.829> basically<00:01:25.670> you<00:01:26.209> take

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
other stuff but um basically you take

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.289 
other stuff but um basically you take
that<00:01:26.840> and<00:01:27.530> spray<00:01:27.799> it<00:01:27.859> on<00:01:27.950> the<00:01:28.039> fabric<00:01:28.399> then<00:01:29.209> you

00:01:32.739 --> 00:01:32.749 
spray it on the panel then you lay the

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:35.169 
spray it on the panel then you lay the
panel<00:01:33.200> from<00:01:33.530> the<00:01:33.619> middle<00:01:33.950> and<00:01:34.100> work<00:01:34.189> smoothly

00:01:35.169 --> 00:01:35.179 
panel from the middle and work smoothly

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:39.190 
panel from the middle and work smoothly
out<00:01:36.130> never<00:01:37.130> work<00:01:37.340> from<00:01:37.549> this<00:01:37.700> side<00:01:37.969> over<00:01:38.509> work

lighting and just recording off this

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:49.240 
lighting and just recording off this
phone<00:02:44.750> but<00:02:46.610> pretty<00:02:47.610> much<00:02:47.819> the<00:02:47.970> best<00:02:48.150> I<00:02:48.420> can<00:02:48.480> do

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
phone but pretty much the best I can do

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:55.370 
phone but pretty much the best I can do
so<00:02:50.250> I<00:02:50.310> can<00:02:50.459> get<00:02:50.610> it<00:02:50.700> outside<00:02:51.150> but<00:02:54.140> it's<00:02:55.140> pretty

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
so I can get it outside but it's pretty

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:02.059 
so I can get it outside but it's pretty
much<00:02:55.530> how<00:02:55.709> it's<00:02:55.860> going<00:02:56.010> to<00:02:56.099> be<00:02:57.590> now<00:02:58.819> I<00:03:00.799> know<00:03:01.799> I'm

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
much how it's going to be now I know I'm

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.240 
much how it's going to be now I know I'm
going<00:03:02.310> to<00:03:02.400> get<00:03:02.519> some<00:03:02.700> people<00:03:03.000> that<00:03:03.120> say<00:03:03.360> that

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
going to get some people that say that

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.590 
going to get some people that say that
that<00:03:05.250> purple<00:03:05.910> and<00:03:06.150> this<00:03:06.690> purple<00:03:07.260> don't<00:03:08.190> match

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
that purple and this purple don't match

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:14.509 
that purple and this purple don't match
but<00:03:10.730> it's<00:03:11.730> pretty<00:03:11.940> close<00:03:12.269> I<00:03:12.600> mean<00:03:13.230> is<00:03:13.620> it's<00:03:14.400> not

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
but it's pretty close I mean is it's not

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:20.569 
but it's pretty close I mean is it's not
as<00:03:14.670> close<00:03:14.880> as<00:03:14.910> I<00:03:15.180> can<00:03:15.239> get<00:03:15.750> and<00:03:19.250> you're<00:03:20.250> gonna

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
as close as I can get and you're gonna

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:24.110 
as close as I can get and you're gonna
probably<00:03:20.910> never<00:03:21.720> going<00:03:22.560> to<00:03:22.650> be<00:03:22.859> able<00:03:22.980> to<00:03:23.190> meet

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
probably never going to be able to meet

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.800 
probably never going to be able to meet
I<00:03:24.450> mean<00:03:24.750> find<00:03:25.609> fabric<00:03:26.609> and<00:03:26.970> paint<00:03:27.239> to<00:03:27.480> match

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
I mean find fabric and paint to match

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.059 
I mean find fabric and paint to match
100%<00:03:28.200> I<00:03:29.130> mean<00:03:29.819> he's<00:03:30.000> going<00:03:30.180> to<00:03:30.329> always<00:03:30.480> be<00:03:30.690> off

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:31.069 
100% I mean he's going to always be off

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:36.970 
100% I mean he's going to always be off
so<00:03:32.810> the<00:03:33.810> main<00:03:34.019> reason<00:03:34.049> why<00:03:34.470> I<00:03:34.500> painted<00:03:35.010> it<00:03:35.160> and

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
so the main reason why I painted it and

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.559 
so the main reason why I painted it and
wrapped<00:03:37.980> the<00:03:38.130> top<00:03:38.370> part<00:03:38.700> because<00:03:39.090> painting

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
wrapped the top part because painting

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:44.240 
wrapped the top part because painting
brings<00:03:40.350> I<00:03:40.769> think<00:03:41.579> it<00:03:41.730> brings<00:03:42.739> the<00:03:43.739> purple<00:03:44.160> from

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
brings I think it brings the purple from

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.819 
brings I think it brings the purple from
the<00:03:44.400> outside<00:03:44.790> to<00:03:45.000> the<00:03:45.030> inside<00:03:45.500> so<00:03:48.650> it's<00:03:49.650> not

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
the outside to the inside so it's not

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.170 
the outside to the inside so it's not
like<00:03:50.040> that's<00:03:50.220> a<00:03:50.370> totally<00:03:50.639> different<00:03:50.970> color

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
like that's a totally different color

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.970 
like that's a totally different color
it's<00:03:51.540> the<00:03:51.630> exact<00:03:52.019> same<00:03:52.049> color<00:03:52.530> that's<00:03:52.769> on<00:03:52.859> the

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
it's the exact same color that's on the

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.370 
it's the exact same color that's on the
outside<00:03:53.430> it's<00:03:54.060> the<00:03:54.239> exact<00:03:54.630> same<00:03:54.810> color<00:03:55.139> that's

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
outside it's the exact same color that's

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.890 
outside it's the exact same color that's
painted<00:03:55.739> on<00:03:55.889> the<00:03:56.010> dashboard<00:03:56.639> so<00:03:56.750> it's<00:03:57.750> going

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
painted on the dashboard so it's going

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.539 
painted on the dashboard so it's going

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
to flow in with with each other and the

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:04.309 
to flow in with with each other and the
top<00:04:02.819> part<00:04:03.120> is<00:04:03.209> you<00:04:03.329> want<00:04:03.450> to<00:04:03.540> match<00:04:03.690> the<00:04:03.720> seats

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319
