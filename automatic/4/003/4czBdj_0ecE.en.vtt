00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:05.310
 Hi guys, I'm here painting these 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.319
 daisies 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.260
 I decided to make this video class 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.480
 teaching you how to do the 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:17.789
 daisy core 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:22.410
 Okay, come on, look, I already did. 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:24.900
 nor the petals of the daisy and me now 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:29.099
 I'll make a crumb here for you. 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.119
 looked step yellow gold is all over the 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.920
 world and the ninth 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.320
 We'll come back then, as usual. 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.890
 expect such a smaller brush 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.450
 this is number 8 of reference 815 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.120
 of the tiger 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:47.430
 Okay, look, you're going to put the ink on it. 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:53.969
 and are going to make a half moon over the 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:56.180
 having tapped doing doing half 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.180
 moon 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:07.210
 Then we do the same 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.490
 process down here 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.010
 filling here that the very end 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:14.170
 maintenance 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:18.310
 mollen this is the number 6 is 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:24.000
 that was 8 is 6 smaller it will get better 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:28.119
 that to do what we will beating 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.830
 until filling here only that people 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:33.040
 learn just that we let down 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:37.060
 this space but clarÃ­n put more 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:40.300
 a little up here ready made 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:45.390
 This we're going to come home with. 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:48.100
 sky surrounds here comes the white paint 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.950
 Let's do the same process only here. 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:54.130
 I'll turn the paint on so it was not 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.740
 hitting here is top to bottom 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:00.990
 Bringing up to get here out of the dark 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:04.179
 When I approach that darkness I leave 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:07.450
 now again the ink on top of just one 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:09.940
 side of the ink brush up I go 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:18.849
 position her who watches it and I go 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:21.340
 beating tapped doing this is one of 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:23.410
 boys I do I throw another 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:29.160

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:31.510
 I'm going to make this one, we can 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:35.849
 train in a little bit 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:39.069
 So here we make the half moon. 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:42.569
 I'm not even going to put a camera here any more 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.569
 next is for you to see 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.070

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:55.439
 We'll make it down here later. 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:10.549
 cleans the brush comes with white ink 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:13.269
 Up, up, I come here. 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:13.269

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:35.780
 folks 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:40.190
 I usually pull this one too. 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:42.230
 than a greater depth in the 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.990
 then when we make the stone and 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:49.340
 valencia, I see that I pulled the fi6 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:51.860
 has been released and therefore a depth is 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:55.070
 that bigger in the core then this tip 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:04:00.310
