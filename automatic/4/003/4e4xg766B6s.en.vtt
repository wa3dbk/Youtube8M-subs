00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.510
 ah 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.850
 Hello, how about today I want to talk to you 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.250
 about driver's licenses in japan 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.500
 and I will also tell you my odyssey of 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.530
 how am I going to acquire mine there are two 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.000
 ways to acquire it the first one is 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.130
 acquire it as the Japanese do 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.560
 you take a written test of 100 questions 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:24.079
 and if I'm not wrong, you can 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.700
 fail 5 answers of those 100 once 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:27.410
 you have passed the written test you 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.619
 they give the driving test and this is where 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.809
 many people fail the second way that 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.540
 is the simplest is to convert the 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:37.219
 leave your country to a Japanese this 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.469
 is if your country qualifies to do this 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:42.350
 conversion the exam is only 10 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:44.239
 very easy questions and once what 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.370
 you have passed the driving test 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.679
 on a driving track that the 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.480
 transit department has to 

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:52.309
 At the moment of applying you will be asked if 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.829
 You want a driver 's license 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:56.659
 automatic or change cars if 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:58.460
 you choose the one of automatic nothing else 

00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:00.620
 you can handle those you can not handle from 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.289
 changes if you choose the license for 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.900
 handle change cars then you can 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:08.180
 handle automatic the second option is 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.180
 the one that I opted for is the conversion of 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.220
 the license of my country 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.100
 for this I had to go to the office of 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:17.230
 transit and they asked me for the passport the 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.050
 residence card remain in Japan my 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.310
 license of mexico photographs and also 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.380
 they asked me for a translation of my 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.630
 license from japanese mexico for that I had 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:29.080
 to go to another office called caf 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:31.000
 jf that's how an insurance or something 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.310
 so there they can translate the 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.200
 license of your country and they do it as in 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:37.869
 one hour or less depending on how much 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.460
 people have that day down in the 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:41.530
 description of this video I leave the 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.960
 web page for those who need 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.600
 see the cost of the translation is three 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.220
 thousand yen right there in that office already 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.440
 can you buy this book that is called 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.060
 roosevelt roads that will serve them for 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.520
 the written exam and the driving test 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.220
 I recommend they have it in Spanish and 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.869
 it costs a thousand yen once he had all 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.850
 the necessary documents I went back to the 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:03.280
 transit department to apply and 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.200
 do the written exam that was ten 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.820
 questions in front of a computer and 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.890
 The exam can be taken in Spanish if 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.739
 they want a very simple test 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.270
 anyone can pass after 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.890
 passing the written exam made me 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.110
 the eye exam once 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.690
 I spent all that I could make an appointment to 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.130
 take the driving test the first time 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.500
 take the driving test what re 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.750
 provides the instructor said he failed him 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.130
 because in the section where I had to 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.160
 go fast 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:32.890
 I went very slowly the driving test 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.530
 it's not easy there are many techniques and 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.450
 skills that one has to demonstrate 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:41.690
 many foreigners compare this exam 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:43.970
 of handling with with the tea ceremony 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.730
 because it requires precision and that you follow 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.560
 all the steps from beginning to end of 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.870
 true that it is a ritual to take 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.850
 this driving test I think almost 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.590
 all Japanese go to schools of 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.450
 driving to prepare for this exam 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.850
 the second time I took the exam 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.110
 fortunately I passed it but I got to 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.000
 practice in the car of one of my 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.250
 friends and I started watching videos to spend 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.170
 this exam because I did not want to fail 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.510
 the exam again I did not want to pay for 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.130
 the exam again and lose a whole day 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.530
 in the transit department for nothing 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.730
 down in the description I leave you links 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.860
 of some videos that I found and 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.960
 I was studying for this exam that 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.700
 they served me a lot and I think these 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.980
 videos were one of the reasons why 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.950
 that I passed the exam I recommend them 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.600
 a tokio tip if you want to practice in the 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.760
 track where it will make them test 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.440
 management here in Tokyo can pay for 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.650
 one hour of practice that will serve you 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:36.020
 very much I do not remember how much they charge I think 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.240
 which are around 30,000 yen or 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.820
 50,000 yen and they have to accompany 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:43.310
 a person who is licensed in my 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:45.980
 case a friend of me accompanied and lent me 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.720
 your car to practice if you do not know 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.220
 to nobody then they can pay you 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.080
 to an instructor from a school of 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.940
 management to accompany them and 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.260
 provide the car and give them 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.970
 instructions and teach them what 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.730
 They need to know to pass this test 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.530
 of driving if you passed the test 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.930
 the instructor has a pink paper 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.000
 if you do not pass it, it will give you a white paper and 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.430
 you have to make another appointment for another 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.620
 driving test if you want to do another 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.630
 once you have passed the exam 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.580
 they will take you to take your picture 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.950
 this and after that you have to 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.570
 wait for another three hours more than the 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.570
 license is processed and delivered to you 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.430
 to go get the license and take the 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.800
 driving test is to lose everything a 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.990
 day so make sure they have all the 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.400
 Free day of the day that they have to go good 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.740
 that 's all for today many 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.970
 thank you for seeing and luck to those who 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.560
 have to take the driving test 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.560
