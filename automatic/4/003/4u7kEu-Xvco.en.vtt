00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:05.920
 and the arrival of the new millennium will be 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.680
 remembered for events that changed 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.600
 radically to the world as the attack 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.539
 terrorist to the twin towers or the 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.699
 facebook creation better said it was a 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:17.830
 new moment a new world without 

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:20.170
 untouchable giants and where the 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:23.590
 older people came into contact with the more 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.990
 little john de mol a dutch lover 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.300
 of television he realized that and 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.130
 proposed a chord television format 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.649
 with the times that combined the 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.020
 reality and fiction it was about 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:36.870
 big brother the first reality show of 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.480
 the history of the planet 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.670
 then more and more content would come 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.980
 risky based on protagonists of 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.219
 real life but put in situations 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.500
 limit was this the case of expedition 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.390
 robinson a reality where types of 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.089
 city ​​had to survive on an island 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.010
 deserted and based on this the 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:58.110
 creative snail decided that it was 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.570
 the moment to create one to the Colombian 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:04.470
 and thus open the way for all those who 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.210
 they went on like that the 2004 challenge was born a 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.950
 reality from that moment 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.890
 became one of the most 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.210
 seen from Colombian television 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.700
 basically because he added the virtues 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.030
 of the format the regional rivalry of 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.030
 country 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:27.000
 I wear this scarf when I go out 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.070
 walked because I walk a lot 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.760
 I put here when the visit arrives for 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.730
 to see who received them was the challenge 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:37.890
 and what and when I go to my therapies 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.900
 in such a case he enjoyed in the soul the 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.490
 I have here at the entrance in a seat 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:46.170
 ready to put me to leave 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:48.240
 running with this scarf of the challenge 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.830
 in original dispatch format 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.300
 roll not south several are 13 chapters 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.130
 this was the first season of 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.190
 robinson expedition in colombia were 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.729
 13 episodes won by rolando patarroyo 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.619
 a latonero won it with all the 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.410
 merits of the world then that's 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.690
 returns to one many times the faith in that 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:09.500
 not only be famous or be rich 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:13.380
 but be smart and be constant 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:17.520
 pays off the male gender 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.890
 female gender the vicissitudes the 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:23.970
 different regions the different 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:25.920
 social classes the different blind and 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.470
 then the element of the three is included 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.840
 beaches that is already another new format that 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.489
 it is the challenge that we do in 2004 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.980
 obviously how the format evolves 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:37.560
 we brought elements from the east 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.750
 universe the elements of society that 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:44.060
 it was the class difference we 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:46.430
 we raised at that time what 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.770
 that in real life one touches 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.330
 compete for a job but not all 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.800
 we arrive in the same conditions are 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.230
 reproducing the injustice of the 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:57.050
 society 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.660
 in those places where they have passed 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:02.090
 starving and surviving is admirable how 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.130
 overlap them and I frankly the 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.920
 I admire all and more girls because 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.690
 there are difficult juries that survive 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.430
 the greatest adventure of all 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.849
 times and is that the participants 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.800
 they arrive with the expectation that everything is 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:17.780
 lie that they will not stand hungry 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.180
 that they are not going to stay in a cave 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.280
 that the clubs are not so big 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.530
 that the tests are not so hard that 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.299
 all that is mounted for the camera and that 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.549
 It is not true that it is so bad 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:30.709
 they are real characters like we are 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:33.110
 all living real situations but 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.810
 in a created universe we have made them the 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.950
 challenge let's call it classic that is 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:40.099
 obedient and challenging celebrities who 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.890
 they are famous former participants and people from 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:45.230
 We have also made the challenge of 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.030
 generations later we would 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.489
 towards the struggle of the region the countries 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.630
 they are very regionalist and everything but and the 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:54.290
 concellos also 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:58.030
 starting to see that fight and the cachacos 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.030
 I realize they do not love us very much 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:06.510
 of last people are neither good nor 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:10.190
 bad we are made of temptations of 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:13.190
 opportunity of circumstances that is 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:13.190
 that 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:18.810
 I believe that it is still a 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:22.580
 way to ask ourselves how we are like 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:24.900
 country how do we interact when we 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:27.150
 we relate to other regions the 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:30.030
 variety is what makes this country 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:33.750
 be what we have and what we are 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.940
 the challenge a 'reality' to the Colombian 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:39.030
 it has been exported to countries like mexico 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:40.590
 Romania and France besides, it was not only 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:42.419
 pioneer in terms of production of 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.250
 this format in Colombia but that the 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:46.710
 queues in the cities where the 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:49.200
 castings last for days and their first and 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.840
 second season they managed to be in the 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.700
 top 10 of the most watched programs of the 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.320
 history of our television 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:57.870
 entrance the program has sold this idea 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:01.110
 that we can all be there venues of 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:03.570
 stratum 7 post 35 or stratum 1 without 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.870
 have studies do not be pretty or 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:07.530
 be ugly 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:11.080
 somehow it seems to me that it is 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:13.750
 shows a bit how successful is the 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:16.060
 format see not just a famous 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:18.580
 for being famous always has those of 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:21.520
 win in them sees one also the 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:24.220
 human weakness but above all that a 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.740
 common person can not only be given to 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:28.930
 know if you can not compete in equality 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:32.110
 of conditions to be able to count 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:34.360
 this company in these 11 years and more than 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:36.280
 200 and peak of participants 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.770
 someone knows someone who helped the 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.750
 challenge without it being someone famous 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:43.330
 where he had a thread or that he has nothing 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:46.110
 I think that's not a program 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.110
 credible 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:52.560
 I would like to go back to live and be more 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:54.870
 young to participate in a challenge is 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:57.980
 would have made sensational because what 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.980
 I discovered very late 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.560
 and remembering the war of the 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:07.340
 integrations I believe that with your 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:10.560
 combative spirit you can still give 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:13.110
 a lot of battle to make you smile 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:15.330
 the viewers and I'm sure already 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:17.610
 the participants already at least 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:19.410
 at least they would calm the conflicts 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:21.890
 between different people many 

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:21.890
 Thank you 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:30.200
 the hardest and most demanding of all 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:30.200
 challenges begins now 

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.450
 but no 

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.660
 ah
