Whenever you feel like snacking then you can prepare corn pakora for tea time.

00:00:26.141 --> 00:00:29.320
So let's start preparing corn pakora.

00:00:29.734 --> 00:00:40.335
For that take tender c orn or sweet corn - 4.

00:00:40.992 --> 00:00:48.421
Corn flour/  plain flour/  gram flour- 2-3 tbsp.

00:00:49.141 --> 00:00:51.875
Finely chopped green coriander leaves - 2-3 tbsp.

00:00:52.523 --> 00:00:58.132
Ginger paste - 1 tsp or 1 inch ginger grated

00:00:58.464 --> 00:01:00.581
Finely chopped green chillies - 2.

00:01:00.893 --> 00:01:02.866

00:01:11.166 --> 00:01:13.149
Oil for frying.

00:01:14.423 --> 00:01:20.407
For corn pakora we need to grate the corn .

00:01:20.945 --> 00:01:25.828
We will extract the pulp of corn. So let's start grating the corn.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.602
Since the corn is tender, we can grate it easily

00:01:35.282 --> 00:01:38.118
Grate the corn seeds from the chaff by rotating it continuosly.

00:01:38.422 --> 00:01:41.483
And therefore we will extract all the pulp.

00:01:44.413 --> 00:01:51.555
We have grated the corn seeds. The grated corn is nearly equivalent to 1 cup.

00:01:52.306 --> 00:01:58.712
Transfer the paste to a bowl.  It will be easier to mix all the spices then.

00:02:02.477 --> 00:02:06.684
Add corn flour to the bowl.

00:02:08.984 --> 00:02:12.974
We have made the paste from the grated corn.

00:02:14.233 --> 00:02:22.099
If we have sweet corn kernels then we need to take one cup sweet corn kernels.

00:02:22.928 --> 00:02:31.092
Grind them coarsely and mix them to make pakora.

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:42.748
Add coriander powder, ginger powder, green chilly

00:02:44.764 --> 00:03:00.303
 red chilly powder, salt and green coriander leaves.

00:03:01.108 --> 00:03:07.342
Stir and mix them for two minutes.

00:03:08.631 --> 00:03:10.740
The mixture is finally ready.

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.320
The oil is hot now and now we will start preparing pakoras.

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.942
Take a spoonful of mixture and deep fry in oil.

00:03:28.147 --> 00:03:33.076
Fry the pakora until golden brown.

00:03:46.458 --> 00:03:50.676
When the pakora turns golden brown transfer it to the plate.

00:03:57.181 --> 00:03:59.949
Fry the rest of the pakoras.

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:17.755
Hot and crispy pakora is ready. They are tasty too.

00:04:18.067 --> 00:04:23.856
Serve the corn pakora with green coriander chutney or tomato sauce.

00:04:24.676 --> 00:04:27.805
Preparing corn pakora is really very simple.

00:04:28.161 --> 00:04:36.364
While preparing corn pakora make sure that the oil is perfectly hot.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:47.778
Else the corn pakora will absorb the oil in excess.

00:04:48.435 --> 00:04:54.473
Whenever you feel like eating corn pakora, just make them at home and enjoy it.

00:04:54.661 --> 00:04:58.700
