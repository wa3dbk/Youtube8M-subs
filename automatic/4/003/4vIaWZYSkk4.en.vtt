the<00:01:47.100> Internet<00:01:47.490> would<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:47.909> call<00:01:48.090> this<00:01:48.240> an

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
the Internet would you call this an

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.870 
the Internet would you call this an
Internet<00:01:48.750> show<00:01:48.780> they've<00:01:49.170> got<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.320> chance<00:01:49.880> I

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
Internet show they've got a chance I

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.749 
Internet show they've got a chance I
would<00:01:51.149> call<00:01:51.570> this<00:01:52.409> interview<00:01:52.979> an<00:01:53.250> Internet

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
would call this interview an Internet

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.460 
would call this interview an Internet
show<00:01:53.790> that<00:01:54.509> has<00:01:54.689> gotten<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.049> chance

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
show that has gotten a chance

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.660 
show that has gotten a chance
I<00:01:55.590> think<00:01:55.829> what's<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.100> little<00:01:56.310> different<00:01:56.399> about

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
I think what's a little different about

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:57.679 
I think what's a little different about
the<00:01:56.909> sketch<00:01:57.119> shows<00:01:57.299> that<00:01:57.420> you've<00:01:57.540> got

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
the sketch shows that you've got

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.209 
the sketch shows that you've got
characters<00:01:58.200> but<00:01:58.500> then<00:01:58.680> they<00:01:58.799> recur

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
characters but then they recur

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.310 
characters but then they recur
throughout<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.700> season<00:02:00.149> so<00:02:00.390> it's<00:02:00.990> almost

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
throughout the season so it's almost

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.649 
throughout the season so it's almost
like<00:02:01.619> you're<00:02:02.310> watching<00:02:03.090> like<00:02:03.930> mini
