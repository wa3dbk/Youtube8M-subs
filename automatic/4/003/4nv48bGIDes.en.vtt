judgment so the gravity crash should be

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.760 
judgment so the gravity crash should be
somewhere<00:00:37.469> between<00:00:37.530> but<00:00:38.460> it's<00:00:38.730> missing<00:00:39.770> if

it got removed officially removed from

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.789 
it got removed officially removed from
PSN<00:01:47.460> stock<00:01:47.729> so<00:01:48.420> you<00:01:48.450> can't<00:01:49.079> buy<00:01:49.320> it<00:01:49.380> but<00:01:49.740> you

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
PSN stock so you can't buy it but you

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.080 
PSN stock so you can't buy it but you
are<00:01:50.399> still<00:01:50.790> able<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.240> download<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:53.090> think

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
are still able to download it I think

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.719 
are still able to download it I think
Sony<00:01:56.719> did<00:01:57.719> this<00:01:58.079> step<00:01:58.680> that<00:01:59.040> you're<00:01:59.280> still

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
Sony did this step that you're still

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.109 
Sony did this step that you're still
able<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.090> download<00:02:00.450> is<00:02:00.780> it<00:02:01.140> because

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
able to download is it because

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.340 
able to download is it because
they<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:04.320> last<00:02:04.530> time<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:04.890> remove<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.399> games

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
they the last time to remove the games

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:13.759 
they the last time to remove the games
they<00:02:07.350> had<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:07.619> lot<00:02:08.039> of<00:02:11.540> let's<00:02:12.540> call<00:02:12.750> it<00:02:13.140> trouble

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
they had a lot of let's call it trouble

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:17.089 
they had a lot of let's call it trouble
with<00:02:14.129> some<00:02:14.370> customers<00:02:15.290> which<00:02:16.290> wants<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:16.830> game

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
with some customers which wants the game

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:21.080 
with some customers which wants the game
or<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:18.120> money<00:02:18.360> back<00:02:18.660> and<00:02:19.129> they<00:02:20.129> got<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.819> money

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
or the money back and they got the money

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.199 
or the money back and they got the money
back<00:02:21.330> but<00:02:22.260> I<00:02:22.290> think<00:02:22.709> this<00:02:23.069> is<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.519> easiest<00:02:23.970> way

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
back but I think this is the easiest way

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.420 
back but I think this is the easiest way
for<00:02:24.450> Sony<00:02:24.959> to<00:02:25.110> handle<00:02:25.590> was<00:02:25.739> explored<00:02:26.160> games

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.690 
for Sony to handle was explored games
remove<00:02:26.879> it<00:02:27.060> for<00:02:27.799> for<00:02:28.799> people<00:02:28.950> who<00:02:29.310> don't<00:02:29.549> own

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
remove it for for people who don't own

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.479 
remove it for for people who don't own
it<00:02:29.940> and<00:02:30.120> still<00:02:30.989> let<00:02:31.290> people<00:02:31.650> who<00:02:31.769> own<00:02:32.069> it<00:02:32.099> buy

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
it and still let people who own it buy

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.360

it<00:02:33.110> combined<00:02:34.110> with<00:02:34.319> a<00:02:34.349> new<00:02:34.620> farmer<00:02:35.040> update

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
it combined with a new farmer update

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.080 
it combined with a new farmer update
this<00:02:35.549> is<00:02:35.730> pretty<00:02:35.970> much<00:02:36.860> a<00:02:37.860> method<00:02:38.579> for

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
this is pretty much a method for

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:45.890 
this is pretty much a method for
preventing<00:02:39.450> the<00:02:39.900> usage<00:02:40.260> of<00:02:40.620> exploits<00:02:44.900> well
