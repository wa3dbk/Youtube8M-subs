00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.030 
dread printing front to back because you
can't<00:00:16.599> remember<00:00:17.140> quite<00:00:17.560> how<00:00:17.770> to<00:00:17.830> put<00:00:17.980> the

paper<00:00:18.189> in<00:00:18.369> the<00:00:18.430> printer<00:00:18.580> so<00:00:18.880> I'm<00:00:18.939> going<00:00:19.060> to

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:19.090 
paper in the printer so I'm going to

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.139 
paper in the printer so I'm going to
show<00:00:19.270> you<00:00:19.329> my<00:00:19.960> little<00:00:20.259> tricks<00:00:20.529> for<00:00:21.099> making<00:00:21.430> out

00:00:22.139 --> 00:00:22.149 
show you my little tricks for making out

00:00:22.149 --> 00:00:23.940 
show you my little tricks for making out
a<00:00:22.180> lot<00:00:22.360> easier<00:00:22.750> so<00:00:22.989> the<00:00:23.110> first<00:00:23.380> thing<00:00:23.649> that<00:00:23.860> I

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:23.950 
a lot easier so the first thing that I

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.700 
a lot easier so the first thing that I
do<00:00:24.009> is<00:00:24.790> like<00:00:25.000> setup<00:00:25.360> kind<00:00:25.630> of<00:00:25.720> a<00:00:25.809> test<00:00:26.079> sheet<00:00:26.439> so

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:26.710 
do is like setup kind of a test sheet so

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.519 
do is like setup kind of a test sheet so
I<00:00:26.739> write<00:00:27.099> headline<00:00:28.059> pretend<00:00:28.960> like<00:00:29.079> this<00:00:29.290> is

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:29.529 
I write headline pretend like this is

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:31.979 
I write headline pretend like this is
the<00:00:30.520> page<00:00:30.730> I<00:00:30.849> want<00:00:31.000> to<00:00:31.059> print<00:00:31.210> on<00:00:31.329> here's<00:00:31.840> the

00:00:31.979 --> 00:00:31.989 
the page I want to print on here's the

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:37.830 
the page I want to print on here's the
writing<00:00:33.030> then<00:00:34.030> I<00:00:36.030> figure<00:00:37.030> out<00:00:37.210> how<00:00:37.480> I<00:00:37.510> want<00:00:37.780> to

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:37.840 
writing then I figure out how I want to

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.750 
writing then I figure out how I want to
test<00:00:38.080> putting<00:00:38.470> it<00:00:38.560> in<00:00:38.680> the<00:00:38.740> printer<00:00:39.040> so<00:00:39.340> I'm

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
test putting it in the printer so I'm

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.270 
test putting it in the printer so I'm
just<00:00:39.910> going<00:00:40.180> to<00:00:40.380> flip<00:00:41.380> it<00:00:41.590> over<00:00:41.740> and<00:00:41.890> then<00:00:42.070> this

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
just going to flip it over and then this

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.880 
just going to flip it over and then this
is<00:00:42.460> the<00:00:42.580> key<00:00:42.790> I'm<00:00:42.940> going<00:00:43.090> to<00:00:43.150> put<00:00:43.270> arrows

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
is the key I'm going to put arrows

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.860 
is the key I'm going to put arrows
showing<00:00:44.890> what<00:00:45.220> direction<00:00:45.700> it<00:00:46.180> went<00:00:46.360> into<00:00:46.780> the

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870 
showing what direction it went into the

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.860 
showing what direction it went into the
printer<00:00:47.230> and<00:00:47.829> then<00:00:48.640> I'm<00:00:48.970> going<00:00:49.150> to<00:00:49.180> slide<00:00:49.690> it

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
printer and then I'm going to slide it

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.040 
printer and then I'm going to slide it
in<00:00:50.050> and<00:00:50.320> I'm<00:00:50.440> gonna<00:00:50.560> go<00:00:50.770> ahead<00:00:51.190> and<00:00:51.630> print<00:00:52.630> the

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
in and I'm gonna go ahead and print the

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.720 
in and I'm gonna go ahead and print the
sheet<00:00:53.320> that<00:00:53.500> I<00:00:53.560> wanted<00:00:53.890> to<00:00:53.950> print<00:00:56.730> meanwhile

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 
sheet that I wanted to print meanwhile

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:59.250 
sheet that I wanted to print meanwhile
I'm<00:00:58.030> just<00:00:58.300> gonna<00:00:58.420> go<00:00:58.600> ahead<00:00:58.840> and<00:00:59.050> set<00:00:59.230> up

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
I'm just gonna go ahead and set up

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.560 
I'm just gonna go ahead and set up
another<00:00:59.470> test<00:01:00.100> sheet<00:01:00.400> for<00:01:00.610> myself<00:01:00.970> just<00:01:01.300> in

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
another test sheet for myself just in

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.930 
another test sheet for myself just in
case<00:01:01.860> that<00:01:02.860> one<00:01:03.070> doesn't<00:01:03.370> come<00:01:03.520> out<00:01:03.640> correctly

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
case that one doesn't come out correctly

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.940 
case that one doesn't come out correctly
so<00:01:04.659> we<00:01:05.500> can<00:01:05.680> already<00:01:06.040> see<00:01:06.610> that<00:01:07.590> it's<00:01:08.590> putting

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
so we can already see that it's putting

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:16.230 
so we can already see that it's putting
over<00:01:09.250> my<00:01:10.030> test<00:01:10.479> case<00:01:10.870> so<00:01:11.310> I<00:01:12.310> know<00:01:12.610> that<00:01:13.150> I<00:01:15.240> want

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
over my test case so I know that I want

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.580 
over my test case so I know that I want
it<00:01:16.330> it<00:01:16.810> needs<00:01:17.440> to<00:01:17.590> flip<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:19.479> where<00:01:19.690> the<00:01:20.049> side

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
it it needs to flip to where the side

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.670 
it it needs to flip to where the side
with<00:01:20.830> the<00:01:20.920> printing<00:01:21.370> is<00:01:21.610> going<00:01:21.970> crazy<00:01:22.240> up<00:01:22.680> so

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
with the printing is going crazy up so

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.960 
with the printing is going crazy up so
I'm<00:01:23.950> gonna<00:01:24.070> go<00:01:24.220> ahead<00:01:24.490> and<00:01:24.640> put<00:01:24.729> it<00:01:24.820> in<00:01:24.940> that

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
I'm gonna go ahead and put it in that

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.940 
I'm gonna go ahead and put it in that
way<00:01:25.330> and<00:01:25.479> it<00:01:25.600> put<00:01:25.780> arrows<00:01:25.990> so<00:01:26.470> I'm<00:01:26.560> gonna<00:01:26.680> put

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
way and it put arrows so I'm gonna put

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.450 
way and it put arrows so I'm gonna put
the<00:01:27.130> top<00:01:27.460> of<00:01:27.729> the<00:01:27.790> page<00:01:28.290> going<00:01:29.290> in<00:01:29.590> first<00:01:29.890> and

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
the top of the page going in first and

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.670 
the top of the page going in first and
we're<00:01:30.850> just<00:01:31.030> gonna<00:01:31.210> see<00:01:31.479> what<00:01:31.659> happens<00:01:31.780> and<00:01:32.229> in

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
we're just gonna see what happens and in

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.250 
we're just gonna see what happens and in
a<00:01:32.770> second<00:01:33.100> I'll<00:01:33.790> show<00:01:34.299> you<00:01:34.360> how<00:01:34.810> to<00:01:34.869> make<00:01:35.080> sure

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:35.260 
a second I'll show you how to make sure

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.450 
a second I'll show you how to make sure
that<00:01:35.290> you<00:01:35.470> don't<00:01:35.650> have<00:01:35.770> to<00:01:35.890> do<00:01:35.979> this<00:01:36.100> every

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
that you don't have to do this every

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.600 
that you don't have to do this every
time<00:01:36.490> you<00:01:36.670> print

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.950 

okay<00:01:40.610> we're<00:01:40.939> already<00:01:41.149> looking<00:01:41.329> better<00:01:41.509> we

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
okay we're already looking better we

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.660 
okay we're already looking better we
definitely<00:01:42.560> got<00:01:42.770> it<00:01:42.979> on<00:01:43.159> the<00:01:43.280> correct<00:01:43.490> side

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
definitely got it on the correct side

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.959 
definitely got it on the correct side
but<00:01:44.450> we<00:01:44.570> want<00:01:44.750> to<00:01:44.840> see<00:01:45.049> if<00:01:45.950> it's<00:01:46.280> obviously

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:46.969 
but we want to see if it's obviously

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:48.810 
but we want to see if it's obviously
going<00:01:47.299> the<00:01:47.390> correct<00:01:47.719> direction

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
going the correct direction

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.499 
going the correct direction
so<00:01:49.820> oh<00:01:50.570> looks<00:01:51.380> good<00:01:51.679> never<00:01:52.070> be<00:01:52.219> my<00:01:52.340> headline<00:01:52.729> so

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
so oh looks good never be my headline so

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:56.080 
so oh looks good never be my headline so
now<00:01:53.719> we<00:01:53.780> know<00:01:54.020> this<00:01:54.259> is<00:01:54.320> the<00:01:54.679> way<00:01:54.799> that<00:01:55.100> we<00:01:55.340> want

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
now we know this is the way that we want

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.270 
now we know this is the way that we want
to<00:01:56.179> always<00:01:56.479> put<00:01:56.689> the<00:01:56.780> paper<00:01:57.020> in<00:01:57.350> like<00:01:58.039> this

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
to always put the paper in like this

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.210 
to always put the paper in like this
arrow<00:01:58.939> is<00:01:59.149> going<00:01:59.270> this<00:01:59.509> way<00:01:59.569> so<00:01:59.990> the<00:02:00.829> simple

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
arrow is going this way so the simple

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.130 
arrow is going this way so the simple
trick<00:02:01.429> to<00:02:01.610> make<00:02:01.819> sure<00:02:02.030> I<00:02:02.060> always<00:02:02.240> know<00:02:02.719> this<00:02:02.869> is

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
trick to make sure I always know this is

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.980 
trick to make sure I always know this is
I<00:02:03.319> just<00:02:03.590> save<00:02:04.369> this<00:02:04.610> paper<00:02:04.909> right<00:02:05.539> next<00:02:05.840> to<00:02:05.899> my

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
I just save this paper right next to my

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.499 
I just save this paper right next to my
printer<00:02:06.289> so<00:02:06.860> the<00:02:06.950> next<00:02:07.130> time<00:02:07.460> I<00:02:07.880> want<00:02:08.299> to<00:02:08.360> print

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
printer so the next time I want to print

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.809 
printer so the next time I want to print
something<00:02:08.660> out<00:02:08.929> I<00:02:09.140> go<00:02:09.649> to<00:02:09.709> my<00:02:09.890> guide<00:02:10.099> you<00:02:10.700> can

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
something out I go to my guide you can

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.539 
something out I go to my guide you can
even<00:02:11.030> kind<00:02:11.660> of<00:02:11.810> stack<00:02:12.260> it<00:02:12.500> up<00:02:12.590> on<00:02:12.769> top<00:02:13.069> put<00:02:13.430> it

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:13.549 
even kind of stack it up on top put it

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:15.520 
even kind of stack it up on top put it
in<00:02:13.670> and<00:02:13.880> take<00:02:14.060> it<00:02:14.090> out<00:02:14.360> so<00:02:14.840> you<00:02:14.870> know<00:02:15.200> you<00:02:15.260> have

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
in and take it out so you know you have

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:16.750 
in and take it out so you know you have
it<00:02:15.620> the<00:02:15.709> right<00:02:15.739> way<00:02:16.010> and<00:02:16.250> there's<00:02:16.370> one<00:02:16.549> more

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
it the right way and there's one more

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.250 
it the right way and there's one more
little<00:02:16.880> trick<00:02:17.120> I<00:02:17.209> want<00:02:17.329> to<00:02:17.420> show<00:02:17.480> you<00:02:17.660> don't

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
little trick I want to show you don't

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.210 
little trick I want to show you don't
just<00:02:18.920> do<00:02:19.340> that<00:02:19.489> test<00:02:19.849> case<00:02:20.150> do<00:02:20.810> one<00:02:21.079> where<00:02:21.709> it's

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
just do that test case do one where it's

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.880 
just do that test case do one where it's
going<00:02:22.670> sideways<00:02:23.269> because<00:02:23.750> sometimes<00:02:24.709> you<00:02:24.799> do

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
going sideways because sometimes you do

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.979 
going sideways because sometimes you do
have<00:02:25.040> things<00:02:25.160> going<00:02:25.400> sideways<00:02:25.700> and<00:02:26.090> sometimes

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
have things going sideways and sometimes

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:29.800 
have things going sideways and sometimes
it<00:02:27.349> can<00:02:27.440> be<00:02:27.500> a<00:02:27.620> little<00:02:27.799> bit<00:02:28.040> confusing<00:02:28.810> you

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
it can be a little bit confusing you

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.420 
it can be a little bit confusing you
know<00:02:29.900> which<00:02:30.079> way<00:02:30.200> it<00:02:30.319> goes<00:02:30.500> in<00:02:30.739> so<00:02:31.069> I'm<00:02:31.340> gonna

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
know which way it goes in so I'm gonna

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.850 
know which way it goes in so I'm gonna
test<00:02:31.790> let's<00:02:32.239> say<00:02:32.450> I<00:02:32.480> put<00:02:32.720> it<00:02:32.840> in<00:02:32.930> this<00:02:33.260> way

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
test let's say I put it in this way

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.520 
test let's say I put it in this way
there's<00:02:34.790> my<00:02:34.910> arrows<00:02:35.390> and<00:02:35.840> I'll<00:02:36.170> just<00:02:36.349> do<00:02:36.500> a

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
there's my arrows and I'll just do a

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.819 
there's my arrows and I'll just do a
test<00:02:36.769> case<00:02:37.220> and<00:02:37.700> see<00:02:38.480> how<00:02:38.599> that<00:02:38.750> turns<00:02:39.049> out

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:41.829 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:44.229 

all<00:02:42.829> right<00:02:42.950> so<00:02:43.280> we<00:02:43.519> can<00:02:43.549> see<00:02:43.730> here<00:02:44.090> that

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
all right so we can see here that

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:45.819 
all right so we can see here that
actually<00:02:44.660> came<00:02:44.810> out<00:02:44.959> correctly<00:02:45.350> there<00:02:45.620> was<00:02:45.709> my

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:45.829 
actually came out correctly there was my

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:48.129 
actually came out correctly there was my
headliner<00:02:46.010> my<00:02:46.370> writing<00:02:46.819> and<00:02:47.060> here's<00:02:47.989> the

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:48.139 
headliner my writing and here's the

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:49.539 
headliner my writing and here's the
direction<00:02:48.350> this<00:02:48.799> goes<00:02:49.010> so<00:02:49.250> if<00:02:49.340> I<00:02:49.400> have<00:02:49.519> a

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:49.549 
direction this goes so if I have a

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:52.240 
direction this goes so if I have a
sideways<00:02:50.000> paper<00:02:50.269> this<00:02:51.170> is<00:02:51.230> exactly<00:02:51.980> the<00:02:52.160> way

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
sideways paper this is exactly the way

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.059 
sideways paper this is exactly the way
that<00:02:52.430> I<00:02:52.549> need<00:02:52.730> to<00:02:52.819> put<00:02:52.940> it<00:02:53.030> in<00:02:53.180> so<00:02:53.900> all<00:02:54.319> I<00:02:54.440> do<00:02:54.650> is

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
that I need to put it in so all I do is

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:57.940 
that I need to put it in so all I do is
I<00:02:55.819> save<00:02:56.120> these<00:02:56.389> two<00:02:56.630> papers<00:02:56.840> right<00:02:57.560> next<00:02:57.799> to<00:02:57.859> my

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
I save these two papers right next to my

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.530 
I save these two papers right next to my
printer<00:02:58.220> and<00:02:58.430> the<00:02:58.519> next<00:02:58.760> time<00:02:58.910> I<00:02:59.209> need<00:02:59.329> to

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
printer and the next time I need to

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.390 
printer and the next time I need to
print<00:02:59.720> back-to-back<00:03:00.260> there's<00:03:00.920> no<00:03:01.160> more

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
print back-to-back there's no more

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:02.830 
print back-to-back there's no more
guessing<00:03:01.519> games<00:03:01.940> and<00:03:02.180> no<00:03:02.239> more<00:03:02.450> trial<00:03:02.720> and

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
guessing games and no more trial and

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.059 
guessing games and no more trial and
error<00:03:02.930> that's<00:03:03.590> all<00:03:03.769> I<00:03:03.799> do

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
error that's all I do

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:07.060 
error that's all I do
