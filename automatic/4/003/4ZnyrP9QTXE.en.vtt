00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:06.600
 hello and welcome to the very first one 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.069
 impact of this review presents a 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.900
 Today's boxer is about it 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.620
 all media keyboard 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.620
 from microsoft 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.830
 all media from keyboard 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.390
 Microsoft is there last April 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.130
 expected from the end of April to the beginning of May 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.920
 Microsoft are also available in 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.630
 the netherlands is the box in the first respect 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.579
 just for a compact probably 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.630
 already a keyboard contains it 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.790
 and any explanation and on the back 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.120
 is from quick start guide 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.550
 see services lie test is shown 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.020
 and here is what you can spend more time with 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.969
 to do 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.190
 listen keyboard these are left 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.469
 mouse button that cannot use that 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.989
 only here is hungry 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.460
 but also your life died on it 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.370
 keyboard 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.739
 here is volume up volume down and 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.519
 this is volume so you mute 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:08.549
 qwerty keyboard just standard with 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:12.030
 the windows button so specially the afternoon 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.920
 new at the top is also handy then the 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.860
 keys that you send and can use 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.310
 especially with Windows 8 or later so 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:23.250
 keys that let you quickly play music here 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.610
 back break or continue playing sick 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:30.140
 search sleep mode 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.140
 configures and configures 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:38.450
 this is no idea 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.450
 daimler faith share it's institutions 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.689
 this is publish you want to duplicate 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.149
 this is desktop 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:54.450
 this point to the dispatcher and therefore here 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:56.759
 another keys such as home wit and that 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.590
 you know that brings you straight to 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.360
 homepage of your web browser 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.180
 this is before the music 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.369
 automatic files of music on that 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.979
 probably on your document 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.560
 around the grain folder of music 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.670
 and this one is for videos so it became rack 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.950
 so must stretch there 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.620
 these are the features that you can do and 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:21.790
 swiping from right to left is therefore 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:25.569
 now for me to start again to 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.610
 search duplicate start and black and 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:29.050
 this is to make another tab different 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:33.310
 open tab is for example start 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:35.920
 or if your pdf file hopefully together like this 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.640
 and you can do animals with two fingers 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.160
 scroll 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.590
 string godwits come and two fingers 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:48.000
 from or in a clay place 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:48.000
 zoom and open the box 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.590
 in the keyboard 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.880
 just wrapped neatly and so on here 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.160
 the box 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.049
 manuals whole book package 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.950
 probably nobody will read and so 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:13.959
 about books and so this is you 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.470
 that it is you with which your keyboard can 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:19.989
 connect it all media keyboard 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:23.079
 is ideal adapter for your living room or 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:24.940
 home office says microsoft and that is 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:26.680
 indeed the case with this usb adapter 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.660
 if it were connected with Bluetooth 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.799
 it would be handy for with your mobile 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.780
 but it would have been no different now 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:36.030
 to connect to your TV and you would 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:40.000
 his five front house parents all the box 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:45.010
 from far beyond anything else and therefore 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:53.799
 further to the keyboard itself we have 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:55.690
 Here yoga or unzipped get me 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:59.440
 feels light 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:05.470
 he is 7 and the 36.7 centimeters in the 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:12.600
 width and therefore the so and 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:12.600
 13.2 so in the widths but measure length 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:17.650
 it feels pretty light and feels good 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.840
 lights on and it is also built by 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.909
 microsoft nice and compact that they are size 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.910
 that he does not immediately break or what you 

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:27.060
 there on Mars that he was not equal 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:30.320
 stops abruptly through the deep or 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:34.200
 so that it simply does not break immediately 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:35.730
 and here the sides at the bottom 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.910
 nothing special 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:41.100
 as well as on the left top nothing 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:42.570
 but the side is on from the group 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.280
 again so that you do not have unnecessary power 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.720
 used with the keyboard 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.050
 so that laid out goes a light 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.400
 and the keyboard still looks 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:52.410
 nice looking 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.360
 just all the keys that need especially 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.530
 the between those cells that you rail above 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.740
 put that woman 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:01.770
 useful with windows 8 higher 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:04.560
 appeals to me and this volume 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:07.470
 keys strong but it is nice to pull with 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:10.260
 feels nice not to push it that way 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:12.270
 your fingers can make you go and do it 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:15.810
 pain from going to hurt is just like that 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:18.420
 pretty tasty on the deep bread nice and good 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:20.820
 for daily use and 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:24.000
 head general I think this is a murder 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:25.560
 key is thanked for looking at 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.220
 our first inbox
