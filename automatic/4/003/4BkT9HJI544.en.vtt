website is the better it does in search
results<00:01:30.659> I<00:01:30.840> think<00:01:31.170> I<00:01:31.260> succeeded<00:01:31.860> because<00:01:32.340> I

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
results I think I succeeded because I

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.610 
results I think I succeeded because I
just<00:01:32.550> tested<00:01:32.909> it<00:01:33.150> out<00:01:33.300> using<00:01:33.540> ping<00:01:34.229> dumb<00:01:34.440> or

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:34.620 
just tested it out using ping dumb or

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.940 
just tested it out using ping dumb or
whatever<00:01:34.860> um<00:01:35.220> calm<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.450> it<00:01:37.409> said<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:37.830> was

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
whatever um calm and it said it was

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.620 
whatever um calm and it said it was
faster<00:01:38.580> than<00:01:38.610> ninety<00:01:38.940> percent<00:01:39.030> of<00:01:39.240> websites

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
faster than ninety percent of websites

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.260 
faster than ninety percent of websites
so<00:01:40.229> uh<00:01:40.260> pretty<00:01:40.860> fast<00:01:41.250> there<00:01:41.850> are<00:01:41.940> times<00:01:42.120> that

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
so uh pretty fast there are times that

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.060 
so uh pretty fast there are times that
it<00:01:42.420> starts<00:01:42.659> like<00:01:42.870> it<00:01:43.020> hangs<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.380> little<00:01:43.560> bit<00:01:43.710> but

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
it starts like it hangs a little bit but

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.950 
it starts like it hangs a little bit but
i<00:01:44.280> think<00:01:44.580> it's<00:01:44.700> it's<00:01:44.970> really<00:01:45.360> fast<00:01:45.690> for<00:01:45.930> a

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
i think it's it's really fast for a

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.080 
i think it's it's really fast for a
website<00:01:46.110> that's<00:01:46.290> filled<00:01:46.979> with<00:01:47.040> videos<00:01:47.460> video

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
website that's filled with videos video

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.880 
website that's filled with videos video
and<00:01:48.240> beds<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.780> pictures<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.350> my<00:01:49.440> high

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
and beds and pictures and my high

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.500 
and beds and pictures and my high
resolution<00:01:50.400> images<00:01:50.850> on<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.060> videos<00:01:51.330> and

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.510 
resolution images on the videos and

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.480 
resolution images on the videos and
stuff<00:01:51.690> so<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:52.110> takes<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.680> long<00:01:52.830> time<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:53.100> load

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
stuff so that takes a long time to load

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.940 
stuff so that takes a long time to load
and<00:01:53.850> it<00:01:54.210> did<00:01:54.450> at<00:01:54.570> first<00:01:54.600> but<00:01:55.049> I<00:01:55.229> worked<00:01:55.590> it<00:01:55.770> and

because<00:03:17.090> I<00:03:17.450> mean<00:03:17.630> I'm<00:03:18.230> not<00:03:18.320> gonna<00:03:18.440> get<00:03:18.620> rid<00:03:18.680> of

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
because I mean I'm not gonna get rid of

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:21.310 
because I mean I'm not gonna get rid of
it<00:03:18.890> i<00:03:18.980> like<00:03:19.370> the<00:03:19.609> the<00:03:20.090> group's<00:03:20.329> ability<00:03:20.510> I<00:03:21.019> mean

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
it i like the the group's ability I mean

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.960 
it i like the the group's ability I mean
if<00:03:21.440> it<00:03:21.560> doesn't<00:03:21.829> no<00:03:22.040> one<00:03:22.160> uses<00:03:22.430> it<00:03:22.700> then<00:03:22.880> I

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
if it doesn't no one uses it then I

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.640 
if it doesn't no one uses it then I
might<00:03:23.150> eventually<00:03:23.660> get<00:03:23.840> rid<00:03:24.019> of<00:03:24.049> it<00:03:24.200> but<00:03:24.470> I

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
might eventually get rid of it but I

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.860 
might eventually get rid of it but I
feel<00:03:24.950> like<00:03:25.100> it<00:03:25.310> has<00:03:25.459> potential<00:03:26.180> so<00:03:26.540> see<00:03:26.750> if<00:03:26.840> you

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
feel like it has potential so see if you

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.180 
feel like it has potential so see if you
could<00:03:27.019> figure<00:03:27.170> it<00:03:27.380> out<00:03:27.470> play<00:03:27.680> with<00:03:27.859> it<00:03:27.980> play

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
could figure it out play with it play

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:29.590 
could figure it out play with it play
around<00:03:28.370> with<00:03:28.519> the<00:03:28.609> website<00:03:28.940> and<00:03:29.090> see<00:03:29.359> what<00:03:29.510> you

around with the website and see what you

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.840 
around with the website and see what you
could<00:03:29.690> do<00:03:29.810> with<00:03:29.840> it<00:03:30.079> and<00:03:30.260> tell<00:03:31.220> me<00:03:31.400> if<00:03:31.579> you<00:03:31.700> find

any bugs while you're doing that because
I<00:03:33.680> just<00:03:33.980> thought<00:03:34.190> since<00:03:34.670> it's<00:03:34.910> gonna<00:03:35.000> be<00:03:35.180> a

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
I just thought since it's gonna be a

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:36.310 
I just thought since it's gonna be a
little<00:03:35.329> bit<00:03:35.480> of<00:03:35.540> time<00:03:35.690> before<00:03:35.930> I<00:03:36.140> actually

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
little bit of time before I actually

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.530 
little bit of time before I actually
finalize<00:03:36.950> the<00:03:37.070> website<00:03:37.430> and<00:03:37.640> have<00:03:38.060> everything
