00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.100
 art 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.309
 at s 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.830
 I think we were able to raise our level of play the debates of concentration 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:11.849
 especially 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.669
 and we showed that we could fight this team 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:16.960
 yet it will be played on details claiming to be as 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.960
 concentrated during the assault 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:22.819
 so many opportunities ie not much 

00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:25.339
 with this circular do not know which 

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:26.210
 approach 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.210
 you have to know not to lose 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.970
 if you push you push it's fine 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.770
 we have to keep the security because we have players in front by boat 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:36.900
 return 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.860
 nimani who can make the difference individually in the apartment 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.530
 a concert to destabilize the block we did so much they are in France 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.800
 and echoes 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.500
 over there any time on my captivity convoy 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.500
 this one equalized to the power of m 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.770
 we will have spaces 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:58.820
 cdc 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.390
 these panels was happening 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.810
 we do not know who died this summer yet do not pay the pots broken 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.570
 and after that it's complicated there was not satisfied 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.840
 these good things we add the department especially it's like a 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.370
 other injured 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.370
 on his side that tomtom and values ​​of his car 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.270
 not a big difference between that and the games that came back that a 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.920
 handle 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.620
 eager to play but it's already a step 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.400
 we must finally remove it will be played on a match this page 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.270
 we stack on 15 euros at home 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.040
 I do not know bad either 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.350
 on Monday 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.550
 to conclude before the end 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.730
 I have the impression that you 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.530
 - if serena did not want to press to score this goal 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.530
 every song so sure to win 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.350
 to win perhaps aa brewery at home so 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.360
 it's true they're not had a lot of 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.750
 I like a lot of games to see so 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.830
 let's say that very little purpose if i had 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.830
 and then it's true that high-performance people at home now 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.260
 watson the confident sense and I think that 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.810
 moments when we will have nothing to lose we will see 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.810
 if we win it will not win some devices 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.589
 if we qualify it will be a feat that will heat both of us 

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:12.199
 especially from robert aron's parents after his affair
