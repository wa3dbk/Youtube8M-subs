00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.080 
I was in pain I think I was more just
like<00:01:08.930> her<00:01:09.380> and<00:01:10.600> just<00:01:11.600> didn't<00:01:12.320> do<00:01:12.530> that<00:01:12.850> and<00:01:13.850> all

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
like her and just didn't do that and all

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.330 
like her and just didn't do that and all
that<00:01:14.270> time<00:01:14.420> stuff<00:01:14.480> I<00:01:15.140> think<00:01:15.440> all<00:01:15.800> kind<00:01:16.280> of

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
that time stuff I think all kind of

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.040 
that time stuff I think all kind of
emotions<00:01:16.550> ran<00:01:17.060> through<00:01:17.270> my<00:01:17.390> mind<00:01:17.600> once<00:01:17.930> I

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:18.050 
emotions ran through my mind once I

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.980 
emotions ran through my mind once I
finally<00:01:18.350> came<00:01:18.950> out<00:01:19.520> of<00:01:19.700> that<00:01:19.820> shit<00:01:20.090> but<00:01:20.750> I<00:01:20.780> was

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
finally came out of that shit but I was

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.560 
finally came out of that shit but I was
a<00:01:21.020> little<00:01:21.380> relieved<00:01:21.740> that<00:01:21.920> that<00:01:22.820> first<00:01:23.090> step

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
a little relieved that that first step

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.020 
a little relieved that that first step
was<00:01:24.320> over<00:01:24.740> I<00:01:24.860> think<00:01:24.950> that<00:01:25.370> first<00:01:25.670> jump<00:01:25.970> was

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
was over I think that first jump was

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.850 
was over I think that first jump was
mine<00:01:26.860> one<00:01:27.860> of<00:01:27.890> my<00:01:28.070> scariest<00:01:28.550> moments<00:01:29.000> because
