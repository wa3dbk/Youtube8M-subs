00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 Hello, I 'm daniel leonardo and your hair 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.210
 and the book of today is called 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.119
 The Tempest of Juliana Closs 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:19.260
 soon after Ambienta 

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:21.480
 [Music] 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.760
 I took this book to read because I 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.170
 I was in a kind of hangover 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.240
 finalist books 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.699
 So I thought I might pick up some books. 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.619
 from the most stupid books to 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.440
 see if this happens a bit 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.890
 Which does not mean I was 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.850
 willing to read badly written books 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.800
 this book has some things 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.920
 interesting but it has other known 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.649
 enough crochet and let's start now 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.039
 introduction of the interesting book 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:49.890
 looks 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.620
 but it just seems like the author is going to play 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.170
 including some of the clichés 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.570
 teenage romances and everything and have 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.910
 advancing this here is a book the law is 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.070
 for young adults have a gender dimension 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.750
 but this is no big deal 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.790
 Who has not heard of this book? 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.250
 is about Jackson who tells the story in 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.659
 first person and he has the power to 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.450
 time travel 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.909
 apparently the problem at first he 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.520
 can not change anything in relation to time 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.950
 and can only get new information 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.110
 traveling through the past and never traveling 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.299
 for before he's alive actually 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.689
 can not even travel for so long 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.729
 ago in the maximum question of days or 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.720
 last week the other characters 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:36.659
 central part of this book is the hole that is the 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.390
 His girlfriend is finally going to cause 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.259
 several confusions in this group of 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.360
 noise 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.049
 the Adam who is a friend of his very 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:49.950
 Intelligent stuck scientist bar 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:52.950
 hacker knows everything and the father himself 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.470
 of jackson that an end 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.869
 I will not even start here basically 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.560
 it seemed that the book was taking a 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.909
 direction to a family drama with 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.469
 romance since holly seemed to be 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:09.020
 quite important 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:12.750
 although it is a good little cliche, well 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.980
 because Jackson is the typical boy to 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.620
 sweat 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:20.010
 I have relationship problems, I do not 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:23.489
 I can open myself with women, etc. 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.200
 holly is a typical girl who likes 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.480
 Boy, then, hold on to anything. 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.760
 he does in the beginning until he has a certain 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.709
 because the route has a friend who is 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.900
 very feminist then you will be playing 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.910
 in her face and the jackson jackson 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.430
 it is this and that and she is 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.709
 completely right but soon it is 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.599
 discarded narrative as if it were there 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.069
 a dead cockroach 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:46.110
 I was really impressed with the 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.720
 lack of ability that some 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.180
 writers seems to demonstrate in writing 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.370
 interesting female characters and 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.459
 not for nothing that several of the most 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.590
 Celebrities portray female characters 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.989
 or that they are strong or that girls 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.780
 can identify themselves perhaps one of the 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:05.730
 elements more emotionally 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:09.000
 interesting is the relationship of the 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:11.640
 jackson with his deceased sister I 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.640
 I can admit that almost even with 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.560
 some tears thus the issue of 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.230
 His family's drama with his sister is 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.109
 really quite interesting and well 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:25.349
 developed and adílio cruz could have 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:27.720
 in this area could have developed 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:29.700
 a relationship a family drama 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.889
 could have developed a little better 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.569
 question of this mythology of travel in 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:35.370
 time although it's serious then 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:37.109
 I imagine this will be better. 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.440
 developed in the coming years as well 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:44.280
 but where the book most sins is a 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:47.790
 arrogance to attempt to insert a 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:52.160
 the cyclic or cia right for those who are reading 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:54.599
 Portuguese only to completely false 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:58.560
 apparently everything is part of a 

00:03:54.599 --> 00:04:00.989
 conspiracy with enemies of time 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:04.230
 who are other time travelers who 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:06.750
 do that are created by a scientist and 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:09.720
 Then there's another scientist and 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.970
 Suddenly Father Jackson entered and he 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:16.650
 is obviously part of controlling 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:18.389
 everything and there the boy who has an attack that 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.280
 I must say until it is enough 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:22.560
 you can believe that 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.890
 it is minimized because I was created 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.639
 anyway it's a good and always better with 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.389
 credit card 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:32.509
 I'm limited etc and suddenly you see 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:35.430
 played in a plot a conspiracy 

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:38.189
 but what is most impressive is that 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.469
 other people accept the fact that 

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:43.229
 he is completely overbearing and spoiled 

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:45.090
 with the greatest naturalness the world knows 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:47.789
 if the president were to appear here 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:50.550
 president would turn to speak I deserve 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:52.740
 to know everything start to dec char and the 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:56.069
 president will probably come to him 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:58.319
 talk you're right what was done 

00:04:56.069 --> 00:05:00.889
 With you it's not fair, I'll tell you 

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:03.659
 all the secrets of the white house now 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:06.029
 but do not tell anyone is this 

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:08.389
 it bothers because without dialogues and dialogue 

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:10.710
 of the bad dialogues that do not make sense 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:12.810
 that you can not believe that people 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:15.680
 actually reacting from that 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:18.810
 way and the very mythology of a 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:21.719
 complicated of the complete embarrassed oma there 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:23.939
 in the end you do not know anymore why 

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:26.879
 that jackson is doing the things that 

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:28.919
 he is doing trying to justify with 

00:05:26.879 --> 00:05:30.779
 something happened before but does not make the 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:32.580
 I also have to say that the 

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:35.069
 really good things this book is that 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:38.099
 one story goes forward then 

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:40.560
 does not have as much entanglement with 

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:43.080
 jackson pampered thoughts is the fact 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:45.599
 that we are discovering the aspects 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.759
 of this time travel mythology 

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:50.279
 along with the main character then 

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:52.469
 this causes a great suspense that goes 

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:54.629
 leaving at least curious to 

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:56.279
 continue reading even if you have 

00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:58.800
 Such bad dialogues in between 

00:05:56.279 --> 00:06:02.699
 so my relatively quick book of 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:05.279
 Reads very easy will probably fan 

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:07.889
 Your curiosity if you are 

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:10.740
 willing to face the problems of the 

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:12.810
 book and also to continue the series at last. 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:14.610
 I do not know if I'm going to stay there. 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:16.740
 There really is a lot for now, but 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:18.330
 who knows the second book is here in 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:20.909
 house has already been released in Brazil is called 

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:23.879
 vortex study released by publisher 

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:27.629
 played with all that fish will take 

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:29.460
 two dolphins but I'll admit that I 

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:32.039
 I was amused I moved with some 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:34.740
 The piece actually falls because I 

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:37.169
 I can not stand dialogues the beginning 

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:39.670
 that's it if you watched it so far 

00:06:37.169 --> 00:06:41.110
 leave your wishes for happiness 

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:44.860
