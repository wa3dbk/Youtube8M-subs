00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:09.280
 hello my friends welcome to this 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:12.310
 preparation of pasta mad pasta 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.050
 crazy the stuff chichas a kitchen 

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:16.779
 childish 

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:19.570
 let's use sausages we use 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:20.789
 here a ranchera type sausage we are going to 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.419
 remove 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.579
 the tips that have something hard there and 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:30.160
 will bother us in the process we are going to 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:32.110
 distribute it to divide it into 3 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.160
 we try that in three equal parts there 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:38.160
 matter if not but good are three parts 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.470
 we divide each sausage we take the 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.040
 spaghetti pasta this is hard 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:47.640
 before cooking it and we're going to go through 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.700
 each part quotes those sausages from 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.980
 I recommend this form to force 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.800
 very close to the sausage as well as they are 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.739
 seeing because if they do it from the part of 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.550
 up far away we are going to split this 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.610
 It is very delicate 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.890
 very delicate packages and it's easy 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.780
 to be split then very carefully 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.390
 making the force very close to the 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.390
 sausage let's insert the 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.420
 in this way as we are seeing 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:24.000
 more or less fit between 7 and 8 spaghetti 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:27.830
 in each 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.370
 in each sausage produced 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:35.500
 that depends on the patience of each one 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:35.500
 go jumping little by little 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:41.009
 the sausage with spaghetti 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.100
 this is going to love the children and it is 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:47.390
 a fun way to make them how it is 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.390
 the pasta if you do not like it 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.970
 here we are already 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.119
 we have inserted well here says it very 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.460
 up and the court split this step 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.230
 for us to you who is better 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.120
 do it from the bottom 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.970
 I like that you also see the 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.670
 mistakes and things that should not be 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.470
 do 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.410
 and at the end of all those that we have 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:15.900
 inserted we have them here ready 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:19.099
 well I would advise that for a meal 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:23.760
 small imagine this for a lot of people 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:26.800
 we put salt in the water to taste 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:30.610
 I put this amount here 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.800
 we put the fire on high fire we add a 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:37.980
 trickle of oil 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:42.180
 and while the water boils we are going to catch 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.180
 4 tomatoes and we're going to grate them 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:50.830
 by the thin part of the striped 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:55.040
 I like to do it so they can 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:59.780
 cut it into pieces and put it to fry 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:01.969
 and live it as you get ready 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.069
 they can with a fork and a spoon 

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:07.459
 can you go 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:10.459
 breaking crushing I prefer this 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:12.019
 I think it's way easier and is 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.379
 As the sauce seems to me it is more 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:16.909
 rich here we have already scratched the four 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:18.920
 tomatoes and we put them to be the 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:22.219
 container notice that I flipped the 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.200
 do not let handle it never by for 

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:27.980
 outside of stove is dangerous 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:31.370
 if there are children and there are animals 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:34.560
 Here we have a big basil and garlic 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:37.290
 we are going to add it 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:41.959
 to this tomato that is already here what 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.959
 we have on fire 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:54.540
 and now we add the garlic 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.930
 well already in our water is boiling 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:05.870
 so we are very careful because 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:10.209
 we can leave to put these 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:13.299
 sausages threaded with spaghetti 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:16.699
 And notice that this starts to boil 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:19.579
 let's add milk cream here 

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:22.039
 we add about 200 grams no matter the 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.330
 amount depends on the amount of pasta 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:25.400
 that you are going to do we do not have 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.100
 exact measurements in this case you are going 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.930
 watching you see how he likes it 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:33.639
 with more cream with less cream this is not 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:36.830
 a secret formula nor is it a formula 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:40.340
 special is everything to the taste this of the 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:43.849
 kitchen is very very to taste we are going to 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.709
 mix all this well 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:49.569
 and we are going to add a couple of 

00:04:45.709 --> 00:04:49.569
 teaspoons of salt 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.970
 we leave 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.970
 until it boils 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:03.130
 add a teaspoon 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.130
 of mustard 

00:05:03.689 --> 00:05:08.979
 and we integrate all this 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.900
 in these sauce pans that is going to 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:14.060
 accompany our pasta 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:16.970
 It is very very very rich 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:19.490
 already when this is finally boiling 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:23.020
 let's add Parmesan cheese to it 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:26.319
 I have a parmesan cheese almost powdered 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:30.220
 very rich let's add add 

00:05:26.319 --> 00:05:32.870
 Pretty enough Parmesan cheese is very 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:36.849
 rich is false 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:38.790
 and this cheese gives a spectacular touch 

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:41.760
 we stir well 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:45.780
 the cheese look like it's already melted 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:48.650
 and it has made us more believe and is this 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:51.470
 delicious sauce 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:53.960
 we are going to stir well that it is integrated 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:56.900
 well the cheese integrate well all these 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:06:00.940
 spices that we have tossed and tested 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:05.210
 let's try salt let's try everything and 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:09.259
 the dog you notice this treat 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:11.080

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:21.620
 very bad to remember dishes but 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:23.389
 I just wanted to teach you this 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:26.150

 put them serve as they want 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:34.490
 many people put no 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:37.550
 care one has gone propose the dish and 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:39.020
 it also looks very very nice here we go 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:41.660
 try to make a figure any 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:44.389
 figure as for as for children 

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:45.919
 they feel a little more attracted but 

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:48.349

 french fries somebody will say that 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:55.249
 a lot of web flour in the end this is an idea 

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:57.019
 simply for you 

00:06:55.249 --> 00:07:01.189
 the idea was pasta and the rest is already running 

00:06:57.019 --> 00:07:03.889
 on your behalf and apart from the 

00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:06.019
 potatoes we are going to put these cochinita that 

00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:08.379
 they're just thick sausages and 

00:07:06.019 --> 00:07:11.629
 you're wrapped in bacon with 

00:07:08.379 --> 00:07:15.349
 olives and we take them to the oven and 

00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:18.229
 You stayed spectacular with chinitas and the 

00:07:15.349 --> 00:07:21.499
 we accompany the pasta with our 

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:23.149
 pillbugs the French dewlap and here 

00:07:21.499 --> 00:07:25.069
 we put the sauce you can put it 

00:07:23.149 --> 00:07:26.749
 they can put the pasta on top 

00:07:25.069 --> 00:07:28.610
 can put it aside on a plate 

00:07:26.749 --> 00:07:31.249
 aside as you want 

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:33.409
 the idea is this and you develop it 

00:07:31.249 --> 00:07:37.219
 already with the creativity that very 

00:07:33.409 --> 00:07:40.099
 surely they have more than mine and here 

00:07:37.219 --> 00:07:43.129
 finally we give it a touch with cheese 

00:07:40.099 --> 00:07:45.370
