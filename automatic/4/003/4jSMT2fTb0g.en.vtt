way that I like to do okay let's get

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.990 
way that I like to do okay let's get
started<00:00:39.649> first<00:00:40.649> roll<00:00:41.040> your<00:00:41.219> fondant<00:00:41.399> out<00:00:41.790> as

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
started first roll your fondant out as

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
started first roll your fondant out as
thin<00:00:42.300> as<00:00:42.570> possible<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:44.450> it<00:00:45.450> won't<00:00:45.629> work<00:00:45.780> if

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
thin as possible and it won't work if

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.740 
thin as possible and it won't work if
your<00:00:46.140> fondant<00:00:46.559> is<00:00:46.770> moister<00:00:47.399> sticky<00:00:47.850> so<00:00:48.180> if<00:00:48.570> you

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
your fondant is moister sticky so if you

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.660 
your fondant is moister sticky so if you
just<00:00:48.989> colored<00:00:49.320> it<00:00:49.500> let<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:49.800> arrow<00:00:50.100> for<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.489> few
