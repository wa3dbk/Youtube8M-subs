00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.180
 I really liked 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:38.219
 interesting number and so small 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.910

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:03.030
 only three there used to be still top I 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:05.489
 I remember that and that it did not grow 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.320
 stops if production activities 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.310

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.880
 ceases release is that last 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.390
 release here was a spiderman who 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.070
 bought 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.830
 The lights that I bought, that is, they even 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.860
 they will not finish these numbers 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.900
 close abruptly as if there were right away 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.700
 so many earthly comments and outraged 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.320
 Yes, those that did not finish the series there 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.970
 I had someone to number one 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.850
 series finishes for example here's the x people 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.430
 against the avengers which I somehow here 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.350
 started to buy steadily collected same 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.509
 how many there are 6 in my issues and here 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.270
 I don’t have to collect until the end 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.280
 I always like to buy 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.759
 the log until it is stable and it closes 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.979
 as sharp as it was with the playstation shop psm 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.720
 also started to buy and even the code is not 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.299
 held out the same very close 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.270
 the story repeated and here and singles from 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.159
 panini they fired in the course of all these 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.490
 translators there Vasily Shevchenko 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.170
 who did it all removed them 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.060
 there from the leadership of the group some 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.649
 often the woman remained the main type 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.360
 editor she answers nothing there on 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.060
 user questions 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.250
 Here is such a story with comics something 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.870
 damn, as if it was growing as if 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.120
 comics industry in russia so much any 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.980
 releases did yes there bent as it were already 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.400
 for future plans and on you 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:29.370
 the walkers do not release the sequel already 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.960
 how many months wait for these 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.970
 single don't know who will be next 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.710
 release a comic book what will the people later 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.050
 only marvolo remains to read 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.240
 shot, they said that while they do not like 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.950
 miss but probably up to 25 numbers 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.010
 stretched out then too by the end of the year 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:48.090
 close nafig oh well let's not about 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:52.730
 sad we will look at number 19 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:03:00.239
 captain america but still it's all 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:03:02.670
 sad so now we go 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:09.470
 the drawing is already hulk already finished 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:12.150
 iron man so here is the sidewall 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.730
 actually with captain america is depicted 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.709
 I saw each other later on the twentieth 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.940
 I'll probably show you a release 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:24.000
 looks like the picture at the moment so well 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:30.900
 that we open more precisely we open we close 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:33.090
 so here we have to have it either 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:37.489
 burning flags new captain america 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:42.390
 course so here it is well ka still pointing 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:44.790
 our such translators from panin 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:50.470
 comic you can see che not here 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:53.600
 indicated who translated oh well 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.790
 in general we have a comic from john on and 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.490
 raider and john caesaga caesaga which 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.430
 we wrote X-men gifted several 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:04.940
 my memory changes me 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:06.470
 scott still we have a greeting here 1 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.720
 cover comic captain america here 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:10.370
 he is a classic suit like that yes 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.320
 probably one of the very first that 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.320
 he was in the second world war 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:22.400
 looks like osama bin laden maybe it's him 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:26.240
 there is a way the plot is generally given comics 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:28.640
 we twisted like here events 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.590
 occurred in september 2011 type with 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.169
 this is terrorism and this is related 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.480
 in comic here you can see the nickname fury again 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:37.390
 he classically Fury nickname is not the shaft 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:41.500
 the subject of the universe is the negro 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:45.860
 cap is also a classic can be said 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:48.770
 as for drawing, drawing is also like that 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:51.410
 as modern not too old but 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:54.550
 not really like this right now in 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.550
 latest comics 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:06.680
 and immediately 2 cover hurts thin 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.680
 issues are more accurate parts 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:17.800
 as I said the plot we will have 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.800
 twisted on the fight against terrorism 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:32.000
 bomber in the course of the action will be with us 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:35.440
 Is it pure in the desert? 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.450
 such as on yellow tones 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.830
 here is another such moment many on it 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:43.810
 draws attention as a captain america 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:47.020
 the whole is saved or something is holding on 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.020
 American flag 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:54.139
 [applause] 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:02.870
 here it is the cover of which she is in charge 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:05.830
 the cover of the comic book is still on the flag 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.449
 america dos symbol eagles freedom 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:12.229
 justice 

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:14.210
 looking for by the way I will come soon poster 

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:16.729
 captain america who i ordered a pancake 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:19.159
 by chance but then when I come 

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:21.490
 tell you the story of how it acquired 

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:26.750
 did not want to buy 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:28.129
 so well let's look at how 

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:30.979
 extra stuff like i said 

00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:34.520
 here we have about September 11th I am a new course 

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:36.800
 apparently the author will be combined 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:39.830
 comics inspired by events 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.460
 2001 when we have a twin tower 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:43.189
 crashed 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:45.650
 either 132 I don’t remember the planes like 

00:06:43.189 --> 00:06:47.449
 there how many 2000 people died shorter 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:50.689
 the dinner of the biggest terrorist attacks 

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:53.840
 in the world for all history but the very cattle yes 

00:06:50.689 --> 00:06:55.120
 the way to this kind involved here is a 

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:58.849
 cup 

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.689
 classic well that's all 

00:06:58.849 --> 00:07:01.819

00:06:59.689 --> 00:07:04.629
 the next issue will be devoted to us 

00:07:01.819 --> 00:07:07.250
 how my memory serves me 20 

00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:08.289
 Daredevil in Daredevil or someone like 

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:12.259
 more convenient 

00:07:08.289 --> 00:07:14.270

00:07:12.259 --> 00:07:17.270
