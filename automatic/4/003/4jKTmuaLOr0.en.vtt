00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.359 
why they add a guy like robert woods to
go<00:01:36.210> along<00:01:36.450> with<00:01:36.590> Stevie<00:01:37.590> Johnson<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.189> look

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
go along with Stevie Johnson and I look

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.789 
go along with Stevie Johnson and I look
at<00:01:38.520> CJ<00:01:38.970> spiller<00:01:39.270> being<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.689> direct<00:01:40.140> beneficiary

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
at CJ spiller being a direct beneficiary

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.429 
at CJ spiller being a direct beneficiary
of<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.310> guy<00:01:41.490> like<00:01:41.700> EG<00:01:42.090> manual<00:01:42.270> back<00:01:42.689> there<00:01:42.930> when

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
of a guy like EG manual back there when

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.170 
of a guy like EG manual back there when
you<00:01:43.560> have<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.770> quarterback<00:01:44.220> that<00:01:44.340> has<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.729> threat

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
you have a quarterback that has a threat

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.539 
you have a quarterback that has a threat
to<00:01:45.210> run<00:01:45.659> it<00:01:45.930> makes<00:01:46.439> everything<00:01:46.829> open<00:01:47.310> up<00:01:47.369> for

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
to run it makes everything open up for

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:48.620 
to run it makes everything open up for
the<00:01:47.640> running<00:01:47.850> game<00:01:48.000> so<00:01:48.180> I<00:01:48.210> wouldn't<00:01:48.600> be

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
the running game so I wouldn't be

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.690 
the running game so I wouldn't be
surprised<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:49.170> see<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.350> guy<00:01:49.590> like<00:01:49.799> Spiller<00:01:50.130> get

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
surprised to see a guy like Spiller get

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.030 
surprised to see a guy like Spiller get
1,600<00:01:51.600> yards<00:01:51.720> this<00:01:51.990> season<00:01:52.200> for<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.829> Buffalo

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.030 
1,600 yards this season for the Buffalo
Bills<00:01:53.220> that's<00:01:53.759> why<00:01:54.030> EJ<00:01:54.570> Manuel<00:01:55.200> went<00:01:55.500> ahead<00:01:55.710> of

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
Bills that's why EJ Manuel went ahead of

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.590 
Bills that's why EJ Manuel went ahead of
a<00:01:56.130> guy<00:01:56.159> like<00:01:56.490> Geno<00:01:56.820> spent<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.450> Buffalo

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600

Bills he gives you more athletically on
the<00:01:59.909> ground<00:02:00.210> than<00:02:00.630> does<00:02:00.960> Geno<00:02:01.560> Smith<00:02:01.950> although

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
the ground than does Geno Smith although

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.270 
the ground than does Geno Smith although
Geno<00:02:02.579> Smith<00:02:02.850> is<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.119> better<00:02:03.299> passer<00:02:04.280> and

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
Geno Smith is the better passer and

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.100 
Geno Smith is the better passer and
again<00:02:05.549> i<00:02:05.579> love<00:02:05.880> that<00:02:06.000> Robert<00:02:06.420> Wood<00:02:06.600> selection

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110

gives<00:02:07.439> you<00:02:07.530> more<00:02:08.069> big<00:02:08.429> play<00:02:08.670> capability<00:02:09.360> and

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
gives you more big play capability and

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.690 
gives you more big play capability and
also<00:02:10.140> adds<00:02:10.410> explosiveness<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.459> receiver

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
also adds explosiveness to the receiver

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.070 
also adds explosiveness to the receiver
position<00:02:11.790> something<00:02:12.510> that's

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080

a<00:02:46.830> better<00:02:47.220> player<00:02:47.640> at<00:02:47.910> that<00:02:47.940> spot<00:02:48.480> maybe<00:02:48.720> I

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
a better player at that spot maybe I

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.260 
a better player at that spot maybe I

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
Khaseem Greene out of Rutgers key code

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:52.670 
Khaseem Greene out of Rutgers key code
is<00:02:51.450> a<00:02:51.480> guy<00:02:51.750> that<00:02:51.930> does<00:02:52.080> a<00:02:52.110> great<00:02:52.350> job<00:02:52.380> in

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
is a guy that does a great job in

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.230 
is a guy that does a great job in
blitzing<00:02:53.070> although<00:02:53.340> he<00:02:53.459> tends<00:02:53.670> to<00:02:53.760> overrun

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
blitzing although he tends to overrun

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.870

but<00:02:56.970> I<00:02:57.030> think<00:02:57.240> Khaseem<00:02:57.540> Greene<00:02:57.570> would<00:02:57.990> have

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
but I think Khaseem Greene would have

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.260 
but I think Khaseem Greene would have
given<00:02:58.260> him<00:02:58.410> a<00:02:58.590> better<00:02:59.040> player<00:02:59.400> and<00:02:59.610> marquise

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270
