there's<00:04:06.950> a<00:04:07.280> slight<00:04:07.819> discrepancy<00:04:08.120> on<00:04:08.659> this

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
there's a slight discrepancy on this

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.330 
there's a slight discrepancy on this
side<00:04:09.110> in<00:04:09.379> terms<00:04:09.560> of<00:04:09.830> filling<00:04:10.610> the<00:04:11.330> spaces<00:04:11.659> in

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
side in terms of filling the spaces in

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:17.740 
side in terms of filling the spaces in
over<00:04:13.340> here<00:04:15.519> here<00:04:16.519> I<00:04:16.790> mean<00:04:17.000> it<00:04:17.150> can<00:04:17.299> go<00:04:17.419> a<00:04:17.449> lot

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
over here here I mean it can go a lot

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.590 
over here here I mean it can go a lot
thicker<00:04:18.109> this<00:04:18.500> sum<00:04:18.859> here<00:04:19.190> here<00:04:20.150> what<00:04:20.359> is<00:04:20.479> it

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
thicker this sum here here what is it

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:21.250 
thicker this sum here here what is it
doing<00:04:20.780> this

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
doing this

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.080 
doing this
well<00:04:21.650> it's<00:04:21.859> hoped<00:04:22.040> for<00:04:22.400> some<00:04:22.520> reason<00:04:22.790> but<00:04:22.910> I'll

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
well it's hoped for some reason but I'll

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.460 
well it's hoped for some reason but I'll
fix<00:04:23.389> that<00:04:23.479> later<00:04:23.600> and<00:04:24.280> you<00:04:25.280> know<00:04:26.080> here<00:04:27.080> maybe

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
fix that later and you know here maybe

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.740 
fix that later and you know here maybe
or<00:04:27.860> maybe<00:04:28.040> if<00:04:28.190> I<00:04:28.250> just<00:04:28.400> readjust<00:04:29.000> it<00:04:29.180> it<00:04:29.570> won't

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
or maybe if I just readjust it it won't

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.960 
or maybe if I just readjust it it won't
seem<00:04:30.020> as<00:04:30.199> thin<00:04:30.500> because<00:04:31.340> it<00:04:31.460> feels<00:04:31.639> like<00:04:31.790> a<00:04:31.820> lot

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
seem as thin because it feels like a lot

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.990 
seem as thin because it feels like a lot
of<00:04:32.120> pieces<00:04:32.840> got<00:04:33.080> cooked<00:04:33.290> onto<00:04:33.740> tied<00:04:34.639> into<00:04:34.820> each

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
of pieces got cooked onto tied into each

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.180 
of pieces got cooked onto tied into each
other<00:04:35.150> but<00:04:35.360> well<00:04:35.690> well<00:04:36.110> I'll<00:04:36.350> fix<00:04:36.620> that<00:04:36.710> later

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
other but well well I'll fix that later

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.830 
other but well well I'll fix that later
um<00:04:37.760> one<00:04:38.330> style<00:04:38.900> that<00:04:39.260> I<00:04:39.340> have<00:04:40.340> worn<00:04:40.669> to<00:04:41.449> keep

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
this hair up at night you might got to

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.120 
this hair up at night you might got to
keep<00:04:44.090> it<00:04:44.270> up<00:04:44.419> at<00:04:44.810> night<00:04:45.080> what<00:04:45.590> you<00:04:45.620> got<00:04:45.860> to<00:04:45.949> put

keep it up at night what you got to put

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:50.020 
keep it up at night what you got to put
out<00:04:46.340> of<00:04:46.669> sight<00:04:46.910> and<00:04:47.030> some<00:04:47.150> joy<00:04:47.650> it<00:04:48.650> was<00:04:49.039> this

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
out of sight and some joy it was this

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.510 
out of sight and some joy it was this
braid<00:04:50.690> that<00:04:50.900> I<00:04:51.020> do<00:04:51.080> so<00:04:51.500> let<00:04:51.620> me<00:04:51.710> do<00:04:51.830> one<00:04:52.100> side<00:04:52.340> of

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
braid that I do so let me do one side of

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.390 
braid that I do so let me do one side of
it<00:04:53.020> alright<00:04:54.020> so<00:04:54.229> party<00:04:54.590> everybody<00:04:54.949> one<00:04:55.070> party

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
it alright so party everybody one party

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:01.810 
it alright so party everybody one party
and<00:04:55.639> then<00:04:58.000> separate<00:04:59.000> it<00:04:59.120> in<00:04:59.180> the<00:04:59.270> back<00:05:00.639> not<00:05:01.639> too

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
and then separate it in the back not too

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.310 
and then separate it in the back not too
harsh<00:05:02.060> because<00:05:02.270> the<00:05:02.600> part<00:05:02.840> doesn't<00:05:03.139> matter

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
harsh because the part doesn't matter

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:08.290 
harsh because the part doesn't matter
and<00:05:04.180> just<00:05:05.180> make<00:05:05.900> sure<00:05:06.080> you<00:05:06.199> brush<00:05:07.300> everything

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 
and just make sure you brush everything

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.830 
and just make sure you brush everything
together

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
together

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:20.529 
together
clear<00:05:10.030> braiding<00:05:11.030> path<00:05:19.060> and<00:05:20.060> you<00:05:20.240> want<00:05:20.450> to

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:20.539 
clear braiding path and you want to

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:22.420 
clear braiding path and you want to
start<00:05:20.840> from<00:05:21.080> here<00:05:21.620> and<00:05:21.860> essentially<00:05:22.190> the

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.430 
start from here and essentially the

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.790 
start from here and essentially the
braid<00:05:22.639> is<00:05:22.760> going<00:05:22.789> to<00:05:23.000> go<00:05:23.120> down<00:05:23.930> the<00:05:24.200> front<00:05:24.530> of

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
braid is going to go down the front of

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.990 
braid is going to go down the front of
this<00:05:25.419> section<00:05:26.419> and<00:05:26.570> and<00:05:27.470> so<00:05:27.710> that<00:05:28.070> you<00:05:28.729> have<00:05:28.970> it

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
this section and and so that you have it

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.800 
this section and and so that you have it
like<00:05:29.240> this

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:29.810 
like this

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:31.089 
like this
that's<00:05:30.349> how<00:05:30.470> it's<00:05:30.620> going<00:05:30.740> to<00:05:30.830> hold<00:05:30.919> together

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:31.099 
that's how it's going to hold together

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:34.930 
that's how it's going to hold together
so<00:05:32.060> let's<00:05:32.270> start<00:05:33.490> you<00:05:34.490> can<00:05:34.639> start<00:05:34.729> from

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 
so let's start you can start from

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.129 
so let's start you can start from
however<00:05:35.270> how<00:05:35.419> you<00:05:35.479> want<00:05:35.720> her<00:05:35.750> but<00:05:35.960> the<00:05:36.050> only

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:40.669 
one I'm going to start pretty high just

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:43.270 
one I'm going to start pretty high just
continue<00:05:41.330> going<00:05:41.360> down<00:05:41.750> remember<00:05:42.410> don't<00:05:42.919> break

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280

down one thing for the here you're not
going<00:05:44.750> to<00:05:44.840> get<00:05:44.960> to<00:05:45.080> the<00:05:45.169> end<00:05:45.320> of<00:05:45.470> this<00:05:45.620> hair

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:45.919 
going to get to the end of this hair

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:47.860 
going to get to the end of this hair
you're<00:05:46.430> getting<00:05:46.669> you're<00:05:46.910> gonna<00:05:47.030> end<00:05:47.270> up<00:05:47.419> back

gonna break down

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:15.469 
gonna break down

saw just grab this whole section to put
into<00:06:28.470> one<00:06:29.389> but<00:06:30.389> it's<00:06:30.509> kind<00:06:30.690> of<00:06:30.810> hard<00:06:30.870> to<00:06:31.139> do

00:06:31.249 --> 00:06:31.259 
into one but it's kind of hard to do
