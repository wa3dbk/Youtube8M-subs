00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:05.180
 a new traffic accident where a motorcycle is involved 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.140
 presented this week in sonsÃ³n 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.740
 the event was presented in the Olympic sector corner of entry to the 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.049
 henao square 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:15.709
 a motorcycle that had been doing driven by a person who had breath 

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:16.740
 alcoholic 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.150
 nevertheless san investigation the subject 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.119
 percent collided with a motor vehicle 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:24.699
 on the motorcycle there were three people 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:29.329
 two of which resulted in severe injuries iii multiple fractures 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:31.429
 percent 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:34.930
 the first of them that has multiple fractures finds the clinic somer in 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:35.890
 Black river 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.760
 The other one was already operated on in MedellÃ­n 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.740
 percent 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.520
 the other passenger of the motorcycle resulted in bruises and 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.190
 and some were killed mateo was discharged 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.310
 imprudence and speeding would have been the cause of the 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:58.300
 accident maybe not yet with much speed of vehicles or motorcycles 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.880
 and bicycles 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.000
 and you have to see nothing 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.790
 and very dry already disembarked that do not have network as a bonus 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.440
 as they come mechanically and if they are about to crash I stay with them 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.340
 in this corner 1 one gets to see what 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.270
 the passage between then what exactly how to have a very little life 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.859
 of the distribution therefore of education and a commitment of all must take care of 

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:26.020
 good the life of each additional to it in this corner have been presented 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.630
 different setbacks 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.000
 which would have occurred after the lack of adequate signaling 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.650
 added to the deterioration presented by both the pavement and the drain queens 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.609
 defined as stella signage 

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:43.349
 and at least since I know what is the reality of our days she 

00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:44.770
 I know a 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.580
 pray for yllana and raised 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.960
 it was already included a few bars of the year has gone 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.770
 and this week I think we can treat it the next load that there was 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.990
 because of that as there is a gap 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.560
 people look for left to be able to read by the ash that threw the body 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.000
 what the authority should take sea sea letter in the matter 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.590
 be so that soon and well the vehicles for the saving item 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.599
 believe some some call jumps or accused policemen for that already 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:19.659
 the expression of transit had requested a budgetary service area 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:22.879
 we hope you know how to count on the same 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:25.269
 to pay attention 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:30.209
 to this site as well as some others where we see that the reducers of 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.289
 speed present 

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:36.659
 defects for not complying with technical standards 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:38.909
 I heard in some places where it's necessary 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:42.269
 it is expected that authorities and citizens in general assume their responsibility 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:46.989
 before these issues and thus avoid incidents in which it is put in 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:48.580
 risk physical integrity 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.110
 both drivers and pedestrians
