00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
air dry for a little bit so it was damp

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.920 
air dry for a little bit so it was damp
but<00:01:06.000> not<00:01:06.060> soaking<00:01:06.210> wet<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:07.100> I<00:01:08.100> did<00:01:08.720> like<00:01:09.720> one

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930

braids<00:01:12.990> um<00:01:14.119> so<00:01:15.119> I<00:01:15.960> I<00:01:16.229> thought<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:16.860> was<00:01:16.979> really

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
braids um so I I thought it was really

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.649 
braids um so I I thought it was really
going<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.400> come<00:01:17.580> out<00:01:17.610> really<00:01:17.820> flat<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.509> was

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
going to come out really flat and it was

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.270 
going to come out really flat and it was
actually<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.049> lot<00:01:19.259> more<00:01:19.320> flat<00:01:19.770> this<00:01:20.220> morning

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
actually a lot more flat this morning

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.219 
actually a lot more flat this morning
than<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:20.880> is<00:01:20.970> now<00:01:21.119> it's<00:01:21.479> kind<00:01:21.720> of<00:01:21.750> puffed<00:01:21.960> up<00:01:22.080> a

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
than it is now it's kind of puffed up a

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.730 
than it is now it's kind of puffed up a
little<00:01:22.439> bit<00:01:22.590> um<00:01:22.860> I<00:01:23.220> only<00:01:23.850> used<00:01:24.600> half<00:01:24.810> a<00:01:25.200> pump<00:01:25.500> of

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
little bit um I only used half a pump of

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.520 
little bit um I only used half a pump of
the<00:01:25.830> curls<00:01:26.430> rock<00:01:26.610> on<00:01:26.850> each<00:01:27.090> side<00:01:27.420> so<00:01:27.840> one<00:01:28.200> pump

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
the curls rock on each side so one pump

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.130 
the curls rock on each side so one pump
for<00:01:28.740> my<00:01:28.829> whole<00:01:29.040> head<00:01:29.360> so<00:01:30.360> I<00:01:30.420> think<00:01:30.509> maybe<00:01:30.810> next

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
for my whole head so I think maybe next

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.590 
for my whole head so I think maybe next
time<00:01:31.350> forever<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.799> do<00:01:31.979> it<00:01:32.159> I<00:01:32.189> would<00:01:32.520> do<00:01:33.119> the

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
time forever to do it I would do the

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.380 
time forever to do it I would do the
product<00:01:34.140> for<00:01:34.380> each<00:01:34.590> braid<00:01:34.979> just<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:35.909> give<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.119> a

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
product for each braid just to give it a

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.359 
product for each braid just to give it a
little<00:01:36.630> more<00:01:36.780> hold<00:01:37.259> because<00:01:37.619> it's<00:01:37.979> gotten<00:01:38.280> a

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
little more hold because it's gotten a

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.510 
little more hold because it's gotten a
lot<00:01:38.520> fluffier<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.509> lot<00:01:39.720> less<00:01:39.750> defined

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
lot fluffier and a lot less defined

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.410 
lot fluffier and a lot less defined
