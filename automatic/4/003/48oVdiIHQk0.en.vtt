00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.820

 throw with no appointments and well I'm going to 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.369
 create or visuals could create something so 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.040
 simple as an axis hub and if you are 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.379
 listening well in pokemon kuwait the 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.480
 truth is that easy is it is very easy to 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:40.769
 create the truth and what am I going to do I am going to 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.900
 leave the image I think I'm going to 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:45.510
 import so you can if 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.100

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.229
 that your auction appears in our 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.629

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:54.180
 interesting very good this zurullo plast 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.760
 the initial can be perfectly fleeting and 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.190
 something smaller and the best is very 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.979
 big you have something smaller toy 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.519

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:04.519
 no one canijo 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.500
 and I think that that can be the body of 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.960
 act perfectly to know you are going 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.160

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.820
 everything not the easiest of everything for you 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.290
