actually I didn't get far enough before
I<00:00:44.969> died<00:00:45.270> to<00:00:45.510> be<00:00:45.629> able<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.840> show<00:00:45.960> you<00:00:46.129> one<00:00:47.129> of<00:00:47.160> the

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
I died to be able to show you one of the

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.520 
I died to be able to show you one of the
interesting<00:00:47.520> things<00:00:48.030> about<00:00:48.329> this<00:00:48.960> is<00:00:49.320> you'll

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
interesting things about this is you'll

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.610 
interesting things about this is you'll
see<00:00:49.860> just<00:00:50.129> how<00:00:50.940> slow<00:00:51.480> this<00:00:51.870> game<00:00:52.140> can<00:00:52.379> move

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
see just how slow this game can move

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.529 
see just how slow this game can move
already<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.520> can<00:00:53.550> see<00:00:53.699> it's<00:00:53.969> starting<00:00:54.329> to

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
already you can see it's starting to

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.000 
already you can see it's starting to
slow<00:00:54.719> down<00:00:54.750> just<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.199> little<00:00:55.350> bit<00:00:55.440> well<00:00:55.739> granted

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
slow down just a little bit well granted

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.770 
slow down just a little bit well granted
my<00:00:56.160> computer<00:00:56.550> might<00:00:56.730> not<00:00:56.879> be<00:00:57.059> quite<00:00:57.270> powerful

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
my computer might not be quite powerful

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.740 
my computer might not be quite powerful
enough<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.559> process<00:00:59.340> all<00:00:59.489> of<00:00:59.520> this<00:00:59.640> but<00:01:00.030> if<00:01:00.359> you

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
enough to process all of this but if you

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.039 
enough to process all of this but if you
really<00:01:01.050> cranked<00:01:01.469> up<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.949> debris<00:01:02.840> I'm<00:01:03.840> out

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
really cranked up the debris I'm out

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.050 
really cranked up the debris I'm out
where<00:01:04.650> all<00:01:04.680> of<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.159> little<00:01:05.400> shrapnel<00:01:05.700> all

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
where all of the little shrapnel all

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.680 
where all of the little shrapnel all
over<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.390> board

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 
over the board

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.310 
over the board
really<00:01:07.470> begins<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.980> pile<00:01:08.250> up<00:01:08.540> then<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.810> game

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
really begins to pile up then the game

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.320 
really begins to pile up then the game
goes<00:01:10.590> almost<00:01:11.400> entirely<00:01:11.730> in<00:01:11.910> slow<00:01:12.150> motion

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
goes almost entirely in slow motion

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.090 
goes almost entirely in slow motion
makes<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.780> lot<00:01:13.020> easier<00:01:13.080> to<00:01:13.440> dodge<00:01:13.650> things

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
makes it a lot easier to dodge things

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.420 
makes it a lot easier to dodge things
look<00:01:14.250> really<00:01:14.550> cool<00:01:14.850> but<00:01:15.630> man<00:01:16.350> oh<00:01:16.380> man<00:01:16.680> just<00:01:17.070> not

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
you could just dodge as I mentioned

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.670 
you could just dodge as I mentioned
before<00:01:52.400> if<00:01:52.729> you<00:01:52.880> stick<00:01:53.150> to<00:01:53.300> the<00:01:53.390> walls<00:01:53.660> a<00:01:54.080> lot

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
before if you stick to the walls a lot

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.450 
before if you stick to the walls a lot
of<00:01:55.119> shots<00:01:56.119> will<00:01:56.509> move<00:01:56.900> like<00:01:57.650> that<00:01:57.680> a<00:01:58.100> lot<00:01:58.400> of

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
of shots will move like that a lot of

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.480 
of shots will move like that a lot of
the<00:01:58.550> shots<00:01:58.820> will<00:01:59.560> overcompensate<00:02:00.560> swing

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
the shots will overcompensate swing

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.450 
the shots will overcompensate swing

to just one left on the screen and then

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.000 
to just one left on the screen and then
you<00:03:01.629> need<00:03:01.780> to<00:03:01.930> wait<00:03:02.109> for<00:03:02.139> them<00:03:02.439> to<00:03:02.470> alternate

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:07.659 
red shots and once they do fire red

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:09.569 
red shots and once they do fire red
shots<00:03:07.959> you<00:03:08.439> gotta<00:03:08.590> sort<00:03:08.859> of<00:03:08.919> circle<00:03:09.400> around

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
shots you gotta sort of circle around

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:11.309
