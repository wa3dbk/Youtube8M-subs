don't<00:02:34.330> know<00:02:34.510> I<00:02:34.720> don't<00:02:34.930> know<00:02:35.080> why<00:02:35.290> but<00:02:35.980> every

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
don't know I don't know why but every

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.850 
don't know I don't know why but every
single<00:02:36.730> person<00:02:36.910> just<00:02:37.660> noticed<00:02:38.230> me<00:02:38.410> I<00:02:38.590> couldn't

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
single person just noticed me I couldn't

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.030 
single person just noticed me I couldn't
walk<00:02:39.010> anywhere<00:02:39.670> and<00:02:39.970> it<00:02:40.090> was<00:02:40.269> eyes<00:02:41.110> and<00:02:41.650> they

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
walk anywhere and it was eyes and they

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.110 
walk anywhere and it was eyes and they
just<00:02:42.160> knew<00:02:42.280> I<00:02:42.310> wasn't<00:02:42.519> supposed<00:02:42.760> to<00:02:42.790> be<00:02:42.940> there

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
just knew I wasn't supposed to be there

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.520 
just knew I wasn't supposed to be there
so<00:02:43.360> I<00:02:43.390> felt<00:02:43.660> like<00:02:43.780> a<00:02:43.840> dad<00:02:44.110> and<00:02:44.379> a<00:02:44.440> house

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
so I felt like a dad and a house

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:45.449 
so I felt like a dad and a house
probably<00:02:44.739> cause<00:02:45.010> you're<00:02:45.160> so<00:02:45.280> awkward

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
probably cause you're so awkward

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.309 
probably cause you're so awkward
socially<00:02:46.060> awkward<00:02:46.420> and<00:02:46.569> weird<00:02:46.720> looking<00:02:46.900> yeah

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
socially awkward and weird looking yeah

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:51.410 
socially awkward and weird looking yeah
I<00:02:47.349> think<00:02:47.530> I<00:02:47.890> think<00:02:47.920> so

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.900 

seventeen<00:02:52.420> again
