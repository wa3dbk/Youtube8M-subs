Molina may be one one or two rounds
where<00:00:12.570> he<00:00:12.630> looked<00:00:12.809> dangerous<00:00:13.019> where<00:00:13.650> he

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
where he looked dangerous where he

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.589 
where he looked dangerous where he
managed<00:00:14.219> to<00:00:14.400> land<00:00:14.549> a<00:00:14.790> couple<00:00:15.089> decent<00:00:15.210> shots

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:17.700 
against Brona but for the most part he

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.160 
against Brona but for the most part he
just<00:00:17.730> couldn't<00:00:18.150> get<00:00:18.240> his<00:00:18.360> off<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:18.720> started

often<00:00:27.120> with<00:00:27.270> his<00:00:27.360> right<00:00:27.600> hands<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.080> it<00:00:28.590> was

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
predictable i guess for Adrien Broner

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.130 
predictable i guess for Adrien Broner
and<00:00:49.680> easier<00:00:50.010> for<00:00:50.220> him<00:00:50.310> to<00:00:50.520> defense<00:00:51.140> Brona

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
and easier for him to defense Brona

and easier for him to defense Brona
never<00:00:52.410> really<00:00:52.710> heard<00:00:52.890> Molina<00:00:53.250> or<00:00:53.460> anything

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
never really heard Molina or anything

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.500 
never really heard Molina or anything
like<00:00:53.790> that<00:00:53.970> it<00:00:54.840> was<00:00:55.170> just<00:00:55.579> both<00:00:56.579> guys<00:00:56.850> circling

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
like that it was just both guys circling

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.770 
like that it was just both guys circling
the<00:00:57.660> ring<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.020> Brona<00:00:59.480> dominating<00:01:00.480> from<00:01:00.660> the

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
the ring and Brona dominating from the

the ring and Brona dominating from the
outside<00:01:01.170> using<00:01:01.560> his<00:01:01.649> superior<00:01:02.160> hand<00:01:02.399> speed

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
outside using his superior hand speed

superior<00:01:03.690> foot<00:01:03.960> speed<00:01:04.199> Molina<00:01:04.949> really<00:01:05.309> could

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
superior foot speed Molina really could

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.440 
superior foot speed Molina really could
again<00:01:05.670> if<00:01:05.850> it<00:01:05.940> off<00:01:06.060> it<00:01:06.180> was<00:01:06.300> quite

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
again if it off it was quite

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.930 
again if it off it was quite
disappointing<00:01:07.050> from<00:01:07.200> John<00:01:07.380> Molina<00:01:07.729> as<00:01:08.729> soon

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:08.940 
disappointing from John Molina as soon

disappointing from John Molina as soon
as<00:01:09.060> this<00:01:09.150> fight<00:01:09.390> was<00:01:09.510> announced<00:01:10.050> I

as this fight was announced I

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.020 
as this fight was announced I
immediately<00:01:12.330> said<00:01:13.140> that<00:01:13.740> Broner<00:01:14.580> should<00:01:14.880> win

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
immediately said that Broner should win

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.050 
immediately said that Broner should win
this<00:01:15.180> fight<00:01:15.470> but<00:01:16.470> when<00:01:16.650> I<00:01:16.680> saw<00:01:17.010> the<00:01:17.070> condition

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
this fight but when I saw the condition

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.630 
this fight but when I saw the condition

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
of Adrien Broner a couple months out I

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.230 
of Adrien Broner a couple months out I
saw<00:01:21.299> how<00:01:21.570> much<00:01:21.750> weight<00:01:22.049> he'd<00:01:22.890> porn<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.549> I<00:01:24.000> saw

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
saw how much weight he'd porn and I saw

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.450 
saw how much weight he'd porn and I saw
a<00:01:24.270> mighty<00:01:24.540> way<00:01:25.049> in<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:25.470> started<00:01:26.190> to<00:01:26.310> have<00:01:26.430> doubts

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
a mighty way in I started to have doubts

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.969 
a mighty way in I started to have doubts
about<00:01:27.270> whether<00:01:27.690> Branagh<00:01:28.440> would<00:01:28.680> win<00:01:28.860> the

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
about whether Branagh would win the

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.859 
about whether Branagh would win the
match<00:01:29.130> even<00:01:29.310> though<00:01:29.490> he<00:01:29.670> is<00:01:29.850> definitely<00:01:30.690> the

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
match even though he is definitely the

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.020 
match even though he is definitely the
far<00:01:31.080> more<00:01:31.229> skilled<00:01:31.590> fighter<00:01:31.890> when<00:01:32.790> you've<00:01:32.909> got

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
far more skilled fighter when you've got

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.990 
far more skilled fighter when you've got
a<00:01:33.090> guy<00:01:33.299> who's<00:01:34.490> fluctuating<00:01:35.490> in<00:01:35.610> weight<00:01:35.790> so

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
a guy who's fluctuating in weight so

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.180 
a guy who's fluctuating in weight so
badly<00:01:36.270> it<00:01:36.630> cannot<00:01:36.990> only<00:01:37.170> affect<00:01:37.650> his<00:01:37.830> stamina

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
badly it cannot only affect his stamina

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:39.950 
badly it cannot only affect his stamina
and<00:01:38.520> his<00:01:38.640> energy<00:01:38.970> levels<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.420> can<00:01:39.450> also<00:01:39.690> affect

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
and his energy levels it can also affect

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.770 
and his energy levels it can also affect
his<00:01:40.290> punch<00:01:40.500> resistance<00:01:40.940> so<00:01:41.940> although<00:01:42.360> i<00:01:42.479> was

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
his punch resistance so although i was

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.410 
his punch resistance so although i was
still<00:01:43.250> staying<00:01:44.250> with<00:01:44.520> my<00:01:44.909> prediction<00:01:45.330> of

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
still staying with my prediction of

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.160 
still staying with my prediction of
Adrien<00:01:45.750> Broner<00:01:45.930> winning<00:01:46.320> I<00:01:46.470> was<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.159> little<00:01:47.520> bit

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
Adrien Broner winning I was a little bit

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.380 
Adrien Broner winning I was a little bit
wary<00:01:49.170> of<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.619> because<00:01:50.100> like<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:50.820> say<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.180> fact

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
wary of it because like I say the fact

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.000 
wary of it because like I say the fact
that<00:01:51.450> he's<00:01:51.630> been<00:01:51.750> fluctuating<00:01:52.170> in<00:01:52.530> weight<00:01:52.710> but

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.010 
that he's been fluctuating in weight but

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.179 
that he's been fluctuating in weight but
it<00:01:53.460> didn't<00:01:53.760> come<00:01:53.909> into<00:01:54.950> didn't<00:01:55.950> become<00:01:56.040> a

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
it didn't come into didn't become a

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.520 
it didn't come into didn't become a
factor<00:01:56.580> in<00:01:56.700> fight<00:01:56.970> he<00:01:57.210> won<00:01:57.600> easily<00:01:57.780> he<00:01:58.140> outbox

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
factor in fight he won easily he outbox

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.460
