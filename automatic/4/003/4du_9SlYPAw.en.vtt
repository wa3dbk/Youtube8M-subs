00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.860 
had in the past was that my follow focus
would<00:00:42.170> i'd<00:00:42.920> like<00:00:42.980> to<00:00:43.340> i<00:00:43.580> like<00:00:44.000> to<00:00:44.120> shoot<00:00:44.360> with<00:00:44.660> a

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
would i'd like to i like to shoot with a

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.110 
would i'd like to i like to shoot with a
vertical<00:00:45.200> grip<00:00:45.680> or<00:00:45.920> a<00:00:46.840> battery<00:00:47.840> pack<00:00:48.230> and<00:00:48.560> you

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
vertical grip or a battery pack and you

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.870 
vertical grip or a battery pack and you
can<00:00:50.120> see<00:00:50.360> what<00:00:51.020> would<00:00:51.170> happen<00:00:51.380> here<00:00:51.830> is<00:00:52.040> this

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:52.880 
can see what would happen here is this

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.110 
can see what would happen here is this
follow<00:00:53.240> focus<00:00:53.680> would<00:00:54.680> smack<00:00:55.430> into<00:00:55.760> this

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
follow focus would smack into this

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.990 
follow focus would smack into this
vertical<00:00:56.660> grip<00:00:56.990> and<00:00:57.290> i<00:00:58.070> just<00:00:58.310> can't<00:00:58.580> get<00:00:58.940> it

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
vertical grip and i just can't get it

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.320 
vertical grip and i just can't get it
close<00:00:59.510> enough<00:00:59.920> to<00:01:00.920> be<00:01:01.070> able<00:01:01.190> to<00:01:01.460> mesh<00:01:01.880> up<00:01:02.120> with

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:02.330 
close enough to be able to mesh up with

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.130 
close enough to be able to mesh up with
that<00:01:02.510> gear<00:01:02.930> but<00:01:03.770> our<00:01:03.920> new<00:01:04.129> fall<00:01:04.460> focus<00:01:05.030> we<00:01:05.509> put

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
that gear but our new fall focus we put

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.370 
that gear but our new fall focus we put
a<00:01:06.170> design<00:01:06.920> change<00:01:07.310> into<00:01:07.789> it<00:01:07.939> and<00:01:08.090> this<00:01:08.990> is<00:01:09.200> just

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
a design change into it and this is just

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.620 
a design change into it and this is just
great<00:01:09.590> because<00:01:09.999> with<00:01:10.999> some<00:01:11.179> other<00:01:11.359> fall

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630

I'm<00:02:01.369> taking<00:02:01.700> it<00:02:01.789> off<00:02:01.939> and<00:02:02.509> now<00:02:02.659> I'm<00:02:02.810> just<00:02:02.929> going

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
I'm taking it off and now I'm just going

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.240 
I'm taking it off and now I'm just going
to<00:02:03.139> put<00:02:03.229> it<00:02:03.409> on<00:02:03.649> the<00:02:04.459> other<00:02:04.700> side<00:02:05.060> and

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
to put it on the other side and

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.100 
to put it on the other side and
you'll<00:02:06.370> see<00:02:06.610> it's<00:02:06.940> totally<00:02:07.600> going<00:02:07.810> to<00:02:07.840> solve

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
you'll see it's totally going to solve

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.570 
you'll see it's totally going to solve
that<00:02:08.410> that<00:02:09.220> problem<00:02:09.729> for<00:02:10.030> me

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.910 

okay<00:02:14.210> so<00:02:14.270> that<00:02:14.630> slops<00:02:15.020> in<00:02:15.260> there<00:02:15.440> like<00:02:15.680> that

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
okay so that slops in there like that

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.420 
okay so that slops in there like that
nice<00:02:16.760> and<00:02:17.030> neat<00:02:17.210> and<00:02:17.450> it's<00:02:18.080> got<00:02:18.290> a<00:02:19.030> nice<00:02:21.430> screw

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
nice and neat and it's got a nice screw

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.210 
nice and neat and it's got a nice screw
that<00:02:22.610> goes<00:02:22.820> in<00:02:23.060> here<00:02:23.270> on<00:02:23.420> the<00:02:23.600> other<00:02:23.630> side<00:02:24.220> you

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
that goes in here on the other side you

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.150 
that goes in here on the other side you
just<00:02:25.250> screw<00:02:25.670> this<00:02:25.850> in<00:02:26.090> nice<00:02:26.300> and<00:02:26.330> tight<00:02:27.160> it's

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
just screw this in nice and tight it's

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.920 
just screw this in nice and tight it's
narrowed<00:02:28.640> so<00:02:28.910> it's<00:02:29.060> nice<00:02:29.240> and<00:02:29.270> easy<00:02:29.600> to<00:02:29.780> get<00:02:29.870> a

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
narrowed so it's nice and easy to get a

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.240 
narrowed so it's nice and easy to get a
hold<00:02:29.990> of<00:02:31.540> now<00:02:32.540> you<00:02:32.600> can<00:02:33.020> see<00:02:33.290> that<00:02:33.530> just

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
hold of now you can see that just

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.160 
hold of now you can see that just
changed<00:02:34.640> the<00:02:34.790> whole<00:02:34.940> world<00:02:35.330> of<00:02:35.570> everything

for<00:02:36.590> using<00:02:36.950> this<00:02:37.100> lens<00:02:37.450> now<00:02:38.450> I<00:02:38.480> can<00:02:38.870> get<00:02:38.990> this

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
for using this lens now I can get this

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.680 
for using this lens now I can get this
down<00:02:39.200> here<00:02:39.440> nice<00:02:39.950> and<00:02:39.980> snug<00:02:40.520> right<00:02:41.420> into

down here nice and snug right into

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.880 
down here nice and snug right into
position<00:02:42.230> where<00:02:42.440> I<00:02:42.470> need<00:02:42.740> it<00:02:42.770> to<00:02:42.980> be<00:02:44.650> mesh<00:02:45.650> that

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
position where I need it to be mesh that

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.220 
position where I need it to be mesh that
gear<00:02:46.220> up<00:02:46.400> just<00:02:46.730> perfectly<00:02:48.670> with<00:02:49.670> this<00:02:50.230> 50

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
gear up just perfectly with this 50

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.590 
gear up just perfectly with this 50
millimeter<00:02:51.709> on<00:02:51.920> there<00:02:52.180> and<00:02:53.180> now<00:02:53.330> watch<00:02:53.570> this

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
millimeter on there and now watch this

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.550 
millimeter on there and now watch this
guy's

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.390 

there<00:02:58.220> it<00:02:58.340> is<00:02:59.230> move<00:03:00.230> this<00:03:00.410> hard<00:03:00.739> stop<00:03:01.040> out<00:03:01.280> of

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
there it is move this hard stop out of

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.500 
there it is move this hard stop out of
the<00:03:01.459> way<00:03:01.610> so<00:03:02.739> this<00:03:03.739> this<00:03:04.250> gear<00:03:04.940> that's<00:03:05.120> on<00:03:05.330> here

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
the way so this this gear that's on here

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:06.850 
the way so this this gear that's on here
has<00:03:05.690> it<00:03:05.720> been<00:03:05.959> trimmed<00:03:06.230> down<00:03:06.380> so<00:03:06.620> there's<00:03:06.800> a

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
has it been trimmed down so there's a

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.380 
has it been trimmed down so there's a
lot<00:03:07.010> of<00:03:07.069> excess<00:03:07.489> there<00:03:07.730> I<00:03:07.760> would<00:03:07.940> cut<00:03:08.120> a<00:03:08.150> lot<00:03:08.360> of

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
lot of excess there I would cut a lot of

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:09.970 
lot of excess there I would cut a lot of
that<00:03:08.599> off<00:03:08.780> but<00:03:09.200> i<00:03:09.260> just<00:03:09.500> want<00:03:09.650> to<00:03:09.709> show<00:03:09.920> you
