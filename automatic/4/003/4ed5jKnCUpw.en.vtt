one straight line going on like that and

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.460 
one straight line going on like that and
for<00:02:31.720> the<00:02:31.810> gun<00:02:32.020> it's<00:02:32.380> just<00:02:32.470> a<00:02:32.710> stick<00:02:33.010> and

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
another stick guys and you could put

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.220 
another stick guys and you could put
like<00:02:38.680> a<00:02:39.190> clip<00:02:39.940> program<00:02:40.540> all<00:02:40.720> right<00:02:40.840> there<00:02:41.020> and

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
like a clip program all right there and

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.450 
like a clip program all right there and
so<00:02:42.220> that's<00:02:42.790> your<00:02:43.060> basic<00:02:43.980> stick<00:02:44.980> figure

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 
so that's your basic stick figure

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.580 
so that's your basic stick figure
running<00:02:45.820> around<00:02:45.990> trying<00:02:46.990> to<00:02:47.170> kill<00:02:47.410> other

running around trying to kill other

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:48.780 
running around trying to kill other
stick<00:02:47.860> feeders<00:02:48.160> okay

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
stick feeders okay

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.920 
stick feeders okay
so<00:02:49.740> part<00:02:50.740> two
