00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:09.000
 good afternoon ladies and gentlemen 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.000
 we are now almost three in the afternoon 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:21.720
 day the first working day after a long 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:24.840
 when today is tuesday 2015 may need 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.759
 Today, in my opinion , today we have 18 exactly 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.090
 I can't say for sure with me 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:30.730
 in numbers 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:33.210
 always confusion and so i answer to 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.790
 The question was: 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:40.950
 where do you think is best to live 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:45.720
 when are you going to immigrate to canada 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:49.600
 my answer is very simple 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:51.900
 itâ€™s best to live where you have 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:58.059
 some close friends 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:01:01.420
 native friends so that in a moment of doubt 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:03.809
 to a minute incomprehensibility of some in 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.759
 life could come to them and 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:10.690
 ask for 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:15.759
 just simple ask for advice ask for 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:18.820
 for help listening to their experiences and not migrating 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:20.440
 repeat their mistakes although mistakes will 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.080
 your own but 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.550
 a third is also someone else's chic is also useless 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.039
 good does not lead 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.170
 but errors will be necessary because 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:31.000
 without mistakes just live impossible glory 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:36.209
 god we make mistakes because 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.209
 I think from mistakes we can learn 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:42.240
 the main thing is not to repeat them not to step on 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.240
 rake on your favorite 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:50.149
 which part of Canada is better to live again 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:53.570
 here opinions differ I acted 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:56.469
 I personally when my personal family when 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:59.929
 emigrated we decided we were migrating 

00:01:56.469 --> 00:02:03.500
 who is the projector where we have our friend 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:06.200
 vitali with his family we did it we 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:10.610
 really emigrated to the provinces 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:13.430
 on time to the city of toronto where we are vital 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:18.319
 immediately helped with her accommodation and the first week 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:21.140
 he us how we say mother duck and we 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:24.319
 little ducklings are following her 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:27.709
 they were dressed then everything in a week we 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:30.080
 said all the floor and thanks we now 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.849
 ourselves will be questions we will come in we 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.510
 lived just in one building with him 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:37.640
 we'll go ask questions 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:42.230
 we will ask and we will try 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:44.840
 swim out yourself and understand what it is 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.700
 nice to have friends and at the same time 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.829
 guys remember that your friends have 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.109
 your relatives u can buddies 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:54.850
 have their own personal life and 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:54.850
 here the most important thing is not to overdo it 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:04.410
 many say that the province will come 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.110
 ontario step on the second then this is how 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.930
 get a big meat grinder live here 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:13.490
 lives a huge number of immigrants 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:16.470
 compare with a huge number of different 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:21.860
 representatives of different cultures from all over 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:25.740
 of the world and here in this meat grinder 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:27.170
 everything will get in the way and many say it 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.120
 not really good ideas 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:34.910
 go second then that is you won't see 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:37.770
 even canadians canadians are real to the nation 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:43.500
 not erased the same somewhere a little away on 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:45.810
 north they live a little further away and on the other 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:50.239
 hand guys nobody to mess with you 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.239
 will you be left to yourself 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.300
 in my opinion the most important thing was 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.930
 who to ask questions even if anyone 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:01.480
 ask questions brave children let's 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:03.370
 with your co-workers with whom you work 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.510
 who do you live next door ask 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.489
 these questions do not be afraid 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:10.540
 people are generally benevolent 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:11.769
 open and when they say I'm here 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.170
 arrived did not eat 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:16.090
 a big pile of shit and now i'm this one 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.579
 a bunch of crap will pay will feed 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:20.709
 surrounding honest i'm not 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:23.800
 I faced it did not face 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:26.110
 because they always gave me good and 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.419
 advice and again respect your 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:30.130
 own head through a prism 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:32.080
 own consciousness you will be very 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:36.360
 much will miss something 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.360
 take something will not accept 

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:45.449
 and it's interesting that even when you 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:48.029
 meet someone here for you and even 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:49.379
 advise where better to go to study where 

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:52.079
 better live 

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:54.419
 smaller towns provide less 

00:04:52.079 --> 00:04:57.599
 opportunities big city is big 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:59.999
 opportunities if you see that by your 

00:04:57.599 --> 00:05:01.590
 specialty fails to live and 

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:04.590
 work then 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:07.410
 you will change your specialty and choice 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:11.990
 professions and educational institutions you 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:11.990
 understand the big city much more 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:19.950
 I think that I answered this question 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:23.250
 everything and the most important thing is the most important thing 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:26.070
 the very first to choose will not go 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:28.350
 go there they will take it earlier we 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:30.740
 could choose a province when we went 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:33.240
 here because the possibilities 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:36.510
 immigrations were much, much more 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:38.580
 now there is no such possibility and if 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:41.520
 this province takes you 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:43.650
 thank God there and work out 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.050
 there three years and then you will choose and 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:48.870
 the province and the city and everything everything everything 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:51.080
 the rest is all you all good luck and good luck 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.080
 until
