00:00:05.033 --> 00:00:06.200
 Hello, everyone! 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.533
 The enemy rushed from the front 

00:00:08.633 --> 00:00:12.133
 The situation is tense, but the enemy planes rushed past 

00:00:12.467 --> 00:00:14.600
 If you want to go around as soon as possible 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.700
 What is the best way? 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.300
 Using combat steering is the fastest way 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:40.100
 This air action combines 180 degree steering and lifting height 

00:00:40.433 --> 00:00:41.600
 The approach is simple 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.533
 Use ailerons and rudders to roll 45 to 50 degrees 

00:00:46.633 --> 00:00:47.933
 Then up 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.433
 After a little experience, you will grasp the angle that each different situation should adopt. 

00:00:53.667 --> 00:00:59.267
 Aircraft with high climb rates turn faster and require a larger angle of inclination 

00:00:59.367 --> 00:01:02.400
 It is not difficult to raise the height for these aircraft. 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.700
 This is difficult for a highly flexible aircraft. 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.367
 So you should use a smaller slope angle 

00:01:08.867 --> 00:01:12.800
 Move the mouse to the direction you want to turn, and tilt it up slightly 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.933
 After completing the maneuver, it will lose a little speed, in exchange for height. 

00:01:17.033 --> 00:01:20.067
 It takes some time to get back to the original speed 

00:01:20.967 --> 00:01:25.033
 Extend the flaps and accelerate when fighting the steering 

00:01:25.133 --> 00:01:30.100
 Stretching the flaps makes the steering faster, but it will greatly affect the speed of the aircraft 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.767
 Use acceleration to keep you at the ideal speed 

00:01:33.867 --> 00:01:39.600
 Combat steering is often used to catch up with enemies or attack ground targets. 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.333
 So far today 

00:01:41.433 --> 00:01:44.067
 Learn to use it! 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.600
 We will join the special squadron in the next episode.
