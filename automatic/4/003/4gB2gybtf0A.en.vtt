00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:04.890
 I care about the city of Lecco, the provincial capital 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.240
 and I want to alter a country jewel in the churches 

00:00:09.939 --> 00:00:12.939
 where I lived several years of my childhood 

00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:17.269
 and where currently hoppla civic residencial 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.779
 my pastoral commitment also takes place in the parish of sant ambrogio 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.730
 monte di rovagnate 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.029
 lecco 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:27.210
 in good 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.119
 or in the evil house symbol 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.500
 cultural and literary symbol which, however, has its roots in a 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.070
 remote past 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.130
 it seems 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:39.700
 there are left 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.550
 phrases 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.050
 in hibernation 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.050
 as a religious symbol say little 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.280
 coveted political symbol 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.540
 from communion and liberation 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.090
 and from the league 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.930
 and I have not yet come out of the fence that looks like an impregnable fortress 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.620
 in recent elections the province has ended up in the hands of churches 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.080
 wrong 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.960
 of a sentienti center 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.960
 started of politically ine chief 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.970
 culpa a bit of everything 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.330
 not last 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.210
 of a center left divided the poor of media means 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.400
 lecco's turn 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.010
 that binds another silence 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.520
 and who wants to recover 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:31.820
 that does it 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.410
 fielding its leader 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.220
 local corradi 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.730
 but whose fame passed past Italic DVDs 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.180
 those who do not remember him as minister of justice deal with the act of being first 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.180
 protected by law enforcement 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.970
 apart from my personal dislikes 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.060
 roberto castelli is a politician you don't see 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.180
 beyond a narrow world where the law of pragmatism applies most 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.710
 boorish 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.820
 if you talk to him xd 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.820
 will ask you what they are for if they do not produce quantities 

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:15.909
 what scares me of politicians like castles and poverty even a big one 

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:17.819
 cross 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:23.180
 that it is not enough to fill things up so many things are then taxes if there is a big one 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.049
 project 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:26.459
 of course 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.869
 it is not the only shortage from the league 

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:31.369
 also the center-left 3 

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:33.549
 of a political project 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:38.749
 but unfortunately the league has a land that if it was cultivated 

00:02:38.749 --> 00:02:40.879
 as he deserved 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:44.599
 it would be euro with a kind of paradise the net close 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:47.179
 UNDESA 

00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:52.409
 so I think roberto castelli is a politician capable of turning things around 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:54.919
 radical to the city of lecco all here 

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:56.989
 not because it doesn't have a program 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.489
 the problem is another I don't think I can have a political project on 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:04.489
 city ​​is not part of the League's subculture 

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:10.559
 the same thing I should say about my little country for &amp; go 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:16.139
 the two lists with the names of the respective candidates are known to the public 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.319
 I don't judge people 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.339
 I judge their political capacity in the sense of 

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:27.529
 administer the country with a big project 

00:03:27.529 --> 00:03:30.139
 ahead 

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:34.169
 when I read these words of one of the two candidates for mayors in ours 

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:39.159
 program we will talk about street parking water service in the country 3 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:43.719
 in the problems of the municipality that need a solution, I wonder 

00:03:43.719 --> 00:03:44.319
 if there is 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:46.469
 where the political project is 

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:50.299
 things things things to put in the pipeline to say that something will be done for 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:51.659
 the good of the country 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:55.849
 what is the true common good for our administrators, please just ask 

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:59.449
 things to do courtly pragmatism 

00:04:02.179 --> 00:04:06.349
 it's not that the other list inspires me to trust some heaven plus one reserve 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:11.569
 it is depressing uncertainties having to choose between two lists that do not give a guarantee 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:13.729
 of political credibility 

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:15.579
 I insist we are tired 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:18.949
 whenever we are called to vote to choose pragmatic ny 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:23.469
 the candidate is only to make a list of things to do when instead 

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:26.469
 first of all we must have a great country project 

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:31.029
 what our administrators mean by development 

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:35.360
 only building development for more unsustainable chaotic wild 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.270
 what they mean by respect for the environment 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.129
 for example, there is telecom sirio complete geological study 

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:48.939
 to prevent it from being built on loose ground 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.760
 and sad stories of landslides these days do not teach anything 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:58.719
 because there continues to be dull grain 

00:04:58.719 --> 00:05:01.929
 there is no doubt that behind there are strong economic interests of 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:08.010
 because neither of the two lists talks about what it intends to do to comply 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:09.460
 the environment 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.360
 and to prevent it from being sent free of charge to planes as program queries 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.550
 on the area above the municipality 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.770
 I insist you cannot afford to destroy a country 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.710
 encourage wild building development though 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.150
 on the other hand as bourgeoisie 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.289
 they promise us jabs 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:31.289
 pavements efficient services 

00:05:31.809 --> 00:05:36.270
 one country extends and the more it becomes invisible 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.020
 we want to understand it or not 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.700
 you administrators 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:42.280
 first guilty sites 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.210
 destroy your countries 

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.139
 chievo citizens by voting for them 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:48.340
 bucket just as guilty 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.460
 i favorited their crime
