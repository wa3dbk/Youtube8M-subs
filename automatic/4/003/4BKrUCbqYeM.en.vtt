really<00:02:01.799> hard<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.250> do<00:02:02.399> interesting<00:02:03.000> so<00:02:03.840> so<00:02:04.110> so

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
really hard to do interesting so so so

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.480 
really hard to do interesting so so so
trim<00:02:04.680> earlier<00:02:04.890> got<00:02:05.189> to<00:02:05.280> make<00:02:05.369> some

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
trim earlier got to make some

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.550 
trim earlier got to make some
adjustments<00:02:05.880> here<00:02:06.000> but<00:02:06.240> I<00:02:06.420> think<00:02:07.380> you<00:02:07.439> can

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
adjustments here but I think you can

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.510 
adjustments here but I think you can
definitely<00:02:07.829> do<00:02:07.890> it<00:02:07.950> you<00:02:08.069> just<00:02:08.129> got<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:08.340> tighten

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
definitely do it you just got to tighten

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.010 
definitely do it you just got to tighten
up<00:02:08.640> a<00:02:08.700> little<00:02:08.729> bit<00:02:08.970> not<00:02:09.209> let<00:02:09.450> mobo<00:02:09.690> she<00:02:09.750> get

so<00:02:33.470> far<00:02:33.650> forward<00:02:33.980> but<00:02:34.099> if<00:02:34.189> you<00:02:34.280> jump<00:02:34.519> at<00:02:34.640> the

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
so far forward but if you jump at the

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:35.830 
so far forward but if you jump at the
right<00:02:34.879> cross<00:02:35.120> exactly<00:02:35.569> i'll<00:02:35.659> just<00:02:35.780> go

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
right cross exactly i'll just go

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.599 
right cross exactly i'll just go
underneath<00:02:36.140> yeah<00:02:36.620> the<00:02:36.799> uppercut<00:02:37.220> just<00:02:37.400> whisk

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:37.609 
underneath yeah the uppercut just whisk

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.629 
you just use it fat the earliest zero
invincibility<00:03:18.139> and<00:03:18.319> I'm<00:03:19.310> gonna<00:03:19.459> get

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:19.639 
invincibility and I'm gonna get

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:21.729 
invincibility and I'm gonna get
technical<00:03:20.090> well<00:03:21.049> I<00:03:21.079> mean<00:03:21.349> technically

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
technical well I mean technically

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.110 
technical well I mean technically
actually<00:03:22.220> I<00:03:22.310> think<00:03:22.340> it<00:03:22.579> has<00:03:22.639> one<00:03:22.849> or<00:03:22.970> two

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
actually I think it has one or two

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.970 
actually I think it has one or two
invincibility<00:03:23.750> frames<00:03:23.959> but<00:03:24.319> the<00:03:24.440> first<00:03:24.680> frame

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
invincibility frames but the first frame

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.589 
invincibility frames but the first frame
that<00:03:25.190> it<00:03:25.310> can<00:03:25.430> hit<00:03:25.609> you<00:03:25.819> is<00:03:26.000> also<00:03:26.209> the<00:03:26.449> first

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:26.599 
that it can hit you is also the first

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:28.599 
that it can hit you is also the first
frame<00:03:26.810> you<00:03:26.930> can<00:03:27.079> hit<00:03:27.230> it<00:03:27.500> yes<00:03:27.949> so<00:03:28.220> the<00:03:28.310> e<00:03:28.340> ex
