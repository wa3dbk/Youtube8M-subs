we're gonna be talking about soos is

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.419 
we're gonna be talking about soos is
dead<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:27.090> what<00:00:27.930> role<00:00:28.170> he<00:00:28.410> has<00:00:28.680> on<00:00:29.010> gravity

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
dead and what role he has on gravity

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.180 
dead and what role he has on gravity
falls<00:00:29.699> so<00:00:30.150> what<00:00:30.300> I<00:00:30.420> do<00:00:30.660> let's<00:00:31.199> begin<00:00:31.590> so<00:00:34.190> what

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
falls so what I do let's begin so what

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.430 
falls so what I do let's begin so what
exactly<00:00:35.309> do<00:00:35.820> we<00:00:35.850> know<00:00:36.059> about<00:00:36.180> this<00:00:36.480> is<00:00:36.630> dead<00:00:36.870> we

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
exactly do we know about this is dead we

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.790 
exactly do we know about this is dead we
know<00:00:37.800> that<00:00:37.829> soos<00:00:38.399> never<00:00:38.850> met<00:00:39.210> his<00:00:39.450> father<00:00:39.800> so

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
know that soos never met his father so

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.229 
know that soos never met his father so
either<00:00:41.280> his<00:00:41.520> father<00:00:41.850> was<00:00:42.180> busy<00:00:42.510> or<00:00:43.079> his<00:00:43.800> father

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
either his father was busy or his father

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:46.340 
either his father was busy or his father
left<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.450> family<00:00:45.480> because<00:00:45.960> he<00:00:46.050> couldn't

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
left the family because he couldn't

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.619 
left the family because he couldn't
handle<00:00:46.530> being<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:47.010> father<00:00:47.280> now<00:00:48.210> we're<00:00:48.510> gonna

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
handle being a father now we're gonna

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.450 
handle being a father now we're gonna
pretend<00:00:48.780> that<00:00:49.079> that<00:00:49.379> wasn't<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.890> reason<00:00:50.070> and

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
pretend that that wasn't the reason and

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.459 
pretend that that wasn't the reason and
we're<00:00:50.610> gonna<00:00:50.700> pretend<00:00:51.090> that<00:00:51.360> he<00:00:51.719> got<00:00:51.899> occupied

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
we're gonna pretend that he got occupied

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.130 
we're gonna pretend that he got occupied
because<00:00:53.039> when<00:00:53.699> they<00:00:53.879> moved<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.300> gravity<00:00:54.870> falls

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
because when they moved to gravity falls

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.729 
because when they moved to gravity falls
maybe<00:00:55.980> he<00:00:56.879> saw<00:00:57.149> something<00:00:57.570> interesting<00:00:57.840> that

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
maybe he saw something interesting that

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.139 
maybe he saw something interesting that
got<00:00:59.370> his<00:00:59.550> attention

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
got his attention

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.779 
got his attention
maybe<00:01:00.570> something<00:01:01.109> so<00:01:01.350> interesting<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:02.430> soos

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
maybe something so interesting that soos

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.490 
maybe something so interesting that soos
would<00:01:03.090> not<00:01:03.270> be<00:01:03.420> able<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.719> handle<00:01:03.989> it

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
would not be able to handle it

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.920 
would not be able to handle it
and<00:01:04.589> when<00:01:05.369> he<00:01:05.519> goes<00:01:05.670> investigating<00:01:06.450> he<00:01:06.630> starts

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
and when he goes investigating he starts

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.679 
and when he goes investigating he starts
to<00:01:07.080> write<00:01:07.290> down<00:01:07.590> what<00:01:08.010> he<00:01:08.159> sees<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.790> later<00:01:09.420> on

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
to write down what he sees and later on

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.830 
to write down what he sees and later on
through<00:01:10.049> his<00:01:10.170> life<00:01:10.409> he<00:01:11.250> creates<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:12.000> portal<00:01:12.390> for

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
through his life he creates a portal for

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.570 
through his life he creates a portal for
an<00:01:13.080> unknown<00:01:13.560> reason<00:01:13.740> we<00:01:14.040> don't<00:01:14.220> know<00:01:14.310> why<00:01:14.549> he

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
an unknown reason we don't know why he

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.969 
an unknown reason we don't know why he
would<00:01:14.909> create<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.299> portal<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:15.930> you<00:01:16.830> would

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
would create the portal and you would

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.880 
would create the portal and you would
try<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.189> go<00:01:17.400> through<00:01:17.700> it<00:01:17.790> or<00:01:18.150> maybe<00:01:18.900> try<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.560> use

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
try to go through it or maybe try to use

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.999 
try to go through it or maybe try to use
it<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.430> suck<00:01:21.030> up<00:01:21.240> all<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.869> bad<00:01:22.380> things<00:01:22.710> and

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
it to suck up all the bad things and

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:23.929 
it to suck up all the bad things and
gravity<00:01:23.460> falls

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
gravity falls

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.870 
gravity falls
we'd<00:01:24.299> only<00:01:24.330> know<00:01:24.750> yet<00:01:25.439> but<00:01:26.130> maybe<00:01:26.400> what<00:01:26.790> I'm

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
we'd only know yet but maybe what I'm

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.670 
we'd only know yet but maybe what I'm
trying<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.119> get<00:01:27.270> at<00:01:27.450> is<00:01:27.659> that<00:01:27.689> soos<00:01:28.200> his<00:01:28.380> father

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
trying to get at is that soos his father

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.910 
trying to get at is that soos his father
is<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.790> author<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.540> maybe<00:01:31.110> that's<00:01:31.409> why<00:01:31.650> he's

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
is the author and maybe that's why he's

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.800 
is the author and maybe that's why he's
vanished<00:01:32.220> now<00:01:32.759> we<00:01:32.820> know<00:01:33.060> Hugh<00:01:33.479> sent<00:01:33.659> a

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
vanished now we know Hugh sent a

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.440 
vanished now we know Hugh sent a
postcard<00:01:34.259> when<00:01:34.770> he<00:01:34.920> was<00:01:35.070> 10<00:01:35.369> but<00:01:36.000> as<00:01:36.150> I've<00:01:36.299> said

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
postcard when he was 10 but as I've said

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.710 
postcard when he was 10 but as I've said
before<00:01:36.590> Suzie's<00:01:37.590> father<00:01:37.920> didn't<00:01:38.880> disappear

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
before Suzie's father didn't disappear

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.289 
before Suzie's father didn't disappear
necessarily<00:01:40.560> because<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.729> creature<00:01:41.939> says

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
necessarily because the creature says

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.990 
necessarily because the creature says
that<00:01:42.689> author<00:01:42.869> hasn't<00:01:43.320> been<00:01:43.439> himself<00:01:43.649> in<00:01:44.250> 30

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
that author hasn't been himself in 30

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.569 
that author hasn't been himself in 30
years<00:01:45.600> so<00:01:46.200> obviously<00:01:46.439> he's<00:01:47.040> not<00:01:47.250> gone

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
years so obviously he's not gone

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.789 
years so obviously he's not gone
obviously<00:01:48.240> he's<00:01:48.450> still<00:01:48.570> here<00:01:49.020> he's<00:01:49.530> just

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
obviously he's still here he's just

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.319 
obviously he's still here he's just
hidden<00:01:50.040> somewhere<00:01:50.399> that<00:01:50.700> we<00:01:50.850> don't<00:01:51.149> know

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
hidden somewhere that we don't know

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.350 
hidden somewhere that we don't know
where<00:01:51.810> he's<00:01:52.110> hidden<00:01:52.439> that<00:01:52.740> he<00:01:53.729> could<00:01:54.000> be<00:01:54.149> gone

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
where he's hidden that he could be gone

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.350 
where he's hidden that he could be gone
but<00:01:55.140> we<00:01:55.530> don't<00:01:55.710> really<00:01:55.829> know<00:01:56.130> I<00:01:56.490> mean<00:01:57.030> he<00:01:57.149> did

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
but we don't really know I mean he did

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.170 
but we don't really know I mean he did
since<00:01:57.600> ooze<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:58.110> postcard<00:01:58.710> so<00:01:59.430> it<00:01:59.820> could<00:02:00.149> be

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
since ooze the postcard so it could be
