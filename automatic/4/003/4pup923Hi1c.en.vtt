00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.539
 welcome to topless point it in one 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.280
 new bet to play saving 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:19.260
 an address book in the back random 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.550
 where we explain how to buy 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.769
 original games 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.449
 being careful precisely with yours 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.880
 portfolio in this installment 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.619
 we will answer the numerous questions that 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.169
 you did asking us how 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.730
 buy console games and 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:34.079
 especially in physical copy indeed 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.490
 in the previous episodes we have 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.990
 treated many topics though 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.270
 mainly concerned with the purchase 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.970
 of gaming in digital delivery and therefore 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.320
 without a real physical copy when 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.840
 instead we want to buy a copy 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.670
 physics of a game with box 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.380
 manual all because we are interested in 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.390
 we simply like collecting 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:55.290
 have it on our shelf as you can 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.790
 see the cheapest way we are 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.470
 managed to find the one to buy them 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.600
 from other countries outside of Italy 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.780
 like England , France 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.890
 Germany and so on and so forth 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.450
 obviously this practice brings with it 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.830
 some problems like the problems of the 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.570
 shipping cost 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.550
 the problem of the game is or is not 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.200
 multilingual all the problems we are 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.750
 managed to dissolve and we will explain 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.220
 just how to solve them too i 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.430
 major cheaper sites that 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:24.600
 we managed to find are play.com 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:28.220
 game.com shopto.net and game.co.uk beyond 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.360
 obviously to the ever-present amazon.co.uk 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.890
 Amazon branch present in large 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.860
 britain all these sites have one 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.659
 what in common allow us to order 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.659
 outside of Italy without having 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.979
 no customs fees , in fact, all 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.380
 these sites by entering inside 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.240
 of the European Union are not subject to 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.430
 customs fees so our package 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.290
 you can easily pass any 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.080
 check and get to us without 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.280
 additional fees or possibility of having them 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.840
 so this is a big advantage 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.210
 because it allows us to buy 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.119
 abroad saving without having and 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.740
 fearful ghost above us of the 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.210
 customs allowing us to 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.950
 buy them at a great price 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.659
 lower than those we can 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.190
 Italy in fact find all these 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.629
 stores are very competitive 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.790
 compared to Italy therefore they propose 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.720
 always the lowest price discounts and who 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.430
 so on and so forth 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.990
 obviously buying from abroad there is 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.120
 a main problem which is that of 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.470
 Multilingual game buying a game 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.180
 precisely from England from France 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.560
 from Germany and who assures us that 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.100
 inside is also the language 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.350
 Italian 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.090
 otherwise we would have thrown away only the 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.560
 our money and therefore this 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.110
 situation come to our aid two 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.870
 italian portals game tal punto it e 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.060
 fifth dimension point it where at their 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.250
 internal we will always find a database 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.160
 updated is constantly checked 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.840
 of securities that can be purchased on foreign sites 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.220
 presenting one on the disc 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.810
 localization in Italian 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.780
 obviously everything is divided by 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:50.670
 xbox 360 wii wii playstation platforms 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.260
 3 the more you have, the more you set it 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.850
 always be sure of what 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.800
 so we are buying if we want 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.000
 buy from abroad saving money 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.440
 little something 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.850
 there is nothing left but to consult these 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.890
 two portals to check if the game 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.209
 which we are interested in presents 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.860
 an Italian localization 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.660
 now we come to the shipping costs i 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.150
 shipping costs for these portals 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.830
 normally they are free 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.330
 if sent within the union 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.100
 European thing that is right for us 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.000
 because we are residing in the union 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.709
 European 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.260
 therefore we will not pay any expenses of 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:21.030
 shipping attention however a few times 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.950
 to get around the cost problem 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.850
 shipping will ship games in 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.250
 separate envelopes 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.260
 so if you order five games a lot 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.450
 probably reveal five games in 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.100
 five separate envelopes and of course with 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.500
 the timing that requires one 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.209
 free shipping of course if you want 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.190
 a shipment within a day within 2 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.900
 days you will have to pay but if for you not 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:43.320
 it is a problem to receive the package 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.540
 with a week or two you can 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.310
 use free shipping 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.890
 obviously all relative and sometimes 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.239
 I myself ordered and came the 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.799
 goods within two or three days 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.840

 even a month you know his 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.870
 his discs free edition his 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.459
 pros and cons 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.620
 having said that I hope I have been there 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.299

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.010
