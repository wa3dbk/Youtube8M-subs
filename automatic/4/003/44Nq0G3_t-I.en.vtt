00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
the system as you're going to see

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.500 
the system as you're going to see
without<00:00:33.000> really<00:00:33.710> taking<00:00:34.710> it<00:00:34.950> apart<00:00:35.190> so<00:00:36.180> are

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
without really taking it apart so are

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.569 
without really taking it apart so are
really<00:00:36.750> quickly<00:00:37.079> with<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.410> battery<00:00:37.770> it's

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
really quickly with the battery it's

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:39.860 
really quickly with the battery it's
right<00:00:38.820> here<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.210> can<00:00:39.329> see<00:00:39.450> that<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.719> battery

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
right here you can see that the battery

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.040 
right here you can see that the battery
is<00:00:40.079> gigantic<00:00:40.590> it's<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.370> 63<00:00:41.790> watt<00:00:42.420> hour<00:00:42.600> battery

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
is gigantic it's a 63 watt hour battery

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.750 
is gigantic it's a 63 watt hour battery
crammed<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:44.280> this<00:00:44.670> 11<00:00:45.090> inch<00:00:45.239> chassis<00:00:45.890> so<00:00:46.890> you

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
crammed to this 11 inch chassis so you

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.580 
crammed to this 11 inch chassis so you
know<00:00:47.850> if<00:00:47.969> you<00:00:48.120> want<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.660> battery<00:00:48.989> this<00:00:49.079> big<00:00:49.320> it's

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
know if you want a battery this big it's

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.049 
know if you want a battery this big it's
really<00:00:49.829> not<00:00:49.980> going<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.190> be<00:00:50.280> removable<00:00:50.760> the

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
really not going to be removable the

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.139 
really not going to be removable the
other<00:00:51.690> option<00:00:52.079> would<00:00:52.170> be<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.760> take<00:00:53.760> off<00:00:53.969> some

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
other option would be to take off some

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.520 
other option would be to take off some
the<00:00:54.180> battery<00:00:54.539> life<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:54.960> then<00:00:55.289> have<00:00:55.500> a

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
the battery life and then have a

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.470 
the battery life and then have a
removable<00:00:55.829> but<00:00:56.309> most<00:00:56.910> people<00:00:57.120> rather<00:00:57.300> have

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
removable but most people rather have

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.090 
removable but most people rather have
the<00:00:57.600> extra<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:58.050> know<00:00:58.140> half<00:00:58.320> an<00:00:58.469> hour<00:00:58.530> or<00:00:58.710> 40

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
the extra you know half an hour or 40

the extra you know half an hour or 40
minutes<00:00:59.129> of<00:00:59.340> battery<00:00:59.520> life<00:00:59.670> and<00:01:00.469> then<00:01:01.469> you

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
minutes of battery life and then you

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.590 
minutes of battery life and then you
know<00:01:01.620> have<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.890> larger<00:01:02.250> battery<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:03.390> can

not<00:02:11.140> symmetric<00:02:11.650> but<00:02:12.840> you<00:02:13.840> know<00:02:13.930> you<00:02:13.989> do<00:02:14.140> have

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
not symmetric but you know you do have

two<00:02:14.410> speakers<00:02:14.769> which<00:02:15.069> is<00:02:15.220> nice<00:02:15.400> not<00:02:15.640> all<00:02:15.849> small

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180

the<00:02:19.860> all<00:02:20.860> the<00:02:21.040> important<00:02:21.370> junk<00:02:21.580> is<00:02:21.730> under<00:02:21.940> here

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
the all the important junk is under here

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.600 
the all the important junk is under here
it's<00:02:22.480> uh<00:02:22.870> obviously<00:02:23.860> there's<00:02:24.040> a<00:02:24.099> fan<00:02:24.400> right

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
it's uh obviously there's a fan right

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.199 
it's uh obviously there's a fan right
here<00:02:24.849> and<00:02:25.090> your<00:02:25.209> CPU<00:02:25.569> and<00:02:26.170> your<00:02:26.519> GPU<00:02:27.519> or<00:02:27.940> both

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
here and your CPU and your GPU or both

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:34.220 
here and your CPU and your GPU or both
under<00:02:28.510> that<00:02:28.690> the<00:02:29.470> CPU<00:02:30.099> is<00:02:30.459> roughly<00:02:33.030> CPUs<00:02:34.030> a

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
under that the CPU is roughly CPUs a

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.600 
under that the CPU is roughly CPUs a
look<00:02:35.230> at<00:02:35.349> I<00:02:35.379> have<00:02:35.530> a<00:02:35.590> chart<00:02:35.860> written<00:02:36.250> out<00:02:36.340> and

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
look at I have a chart written out and

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
look at I have a chart written out and
it's<00:02:36.730> upside<00:02:37.030> down<00:02:37.170> so<00:02:38.170> I<00:02:39.180> think<00:02:40.180> it<00:02:40.299> was<00:02:40.390> I

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
it's upside down so I think it was I

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.479 
it's upside down so I think it was I
think<00:02:40.780> the<00:02:40.959> CPU<00:02:41.440> is<00:02:41.560> right<00:02:41.680> here<00:02:41.829> and<00:02:42.069> the<00:02:42.130> GPU

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
think the CPU is right here and the GPU

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.699 
think the CPU is right here and the GPU
is<00:02:42.549> right<00:02:42.700> here<00:02:42.910> maybe<00:02:43.239> it's<00:02:43.420> it's<00:02:44.349> reversed

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
is right here maybe it's it's reversed

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.470 
is right here maybe it's it's reversed
anyway<00:02:45.250> the<00:02:45.370> point<00:02:45.489> is<00:02:45.640> they're<00:02:45.910> both<00:02:46.090> under

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
anyway the point is they're both under

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.220 
anyway the point is they're both under
here<00:02:46.690> and<00:02:46.930> there<00:02:47.890> is<00:02:48.400> a<00:02:48.430> big<00:02:48.670> fan<00:02:48.910> and<00:02:49.239> then

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
here and there is a big fan and then

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.559 
here and there is a big fan and then
there's<00:02:50.379> a<00:02:50.470> two<00:02:50.950> copper<00:02:51.549> heat<00:02:51.700> pipes<00:02:51.940> which

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 
there's a two copper heat pipes which

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:55.559 
there's a two copper heat pipes which
are<00:02:52.720> gonna<00:02:52.930> cool<00:02:53.290> those<00:02:54.209> some<00:02:55.209> people<00:02:55.450> have

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
are gonna cool those some people have

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:57.780 
are gonna cool those some people have
taken<00:02:55.660> it<00:02:55.900> apart<00:02:56.079> online<00:02:56.500> and<00:02:56.799> so<00:02:57.640> if<00:02:57.700> you

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
taken it apart online and so if you

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.460 
taken it apart online and so if you
really<00:02:57.970> do<00:02:58.090> want<00:02:58.299> to<00:02:58.329> get<00:02:58.450> a<00:02:58.510> look<00:02:58.690> at<00:02:58.930> the

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
really do want to get a look at the

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.009 
really do want to get a look at the
schematics<00:03:00.010> or<00:03:00.599> mathematics<00:03:01.599> at<00:03:01.930> the

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
schematics or mathematics at the

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:04.949 
schematics or mathematics at the
motherboard<00:03:02.410> then<00:03:02.890> you<00:03:03.069> can<00:03:03.280> so<00:03:03.660> anyway<00:03:04.660> this

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
motherboard then you can so anyway this

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:05.699 
motherboard then you can so anyway this
is<00:03:05.019> the<00:03:05.290> Alienware

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
is the Alienware

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.330 
is the Alienware
M<00:03:05.829> 11x<00:03:06.610> it's<00:03:07.090> a<00:03:07.530> somewhat<00:03:08.530> user<00:03:08.829> serviceable

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
M 11x it's a somewhat user serviceable

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.000 
M 11x it's a somewhat user serviceable
not<00:03:10.239> you<00:03:11.109> know<00:03:11.200> the<00:03:11.319> important<00:03:11.620> stuff<00:03:11.650> like

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
not you know the important stuff like

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.349 
not you know the important stuff like
the<00:03:12.160> memory<00:03:12.459> and<00:03:12.639> the<00:03:12.730> hard<00:03:12.819> drive<00:03:13.060> are<00:03:13.209> easy

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:13.359 
the memory and the hard drive are easy

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:16.620 
the memory and the hard drive are easy
to<00:03:13.510> get<00:03:13.660> at<00:03:13.810> the<00:03:14.500> rest<00:03:14.799> of<00:03:14.950> the<00:03:15.069> stuff<00:03:15.630> you

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
to get at the rest of the stuff you

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.690 
to get at the rest of the stuff you
probably<00:03:16.750> want<00:03:17.079> to<00:03:17.109> leave<00:03:17.230> alone<00:03:17.519> anyway<00:03:18.519> this

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
probably want to leave alone anyway this

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.400 
probably want to leave alone anyway this
