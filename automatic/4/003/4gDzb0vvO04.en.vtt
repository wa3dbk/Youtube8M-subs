around the base on the outside layer

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.569 
around the base on the outside layer
where<00:00:53.760> all<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.000> defenses<00:00:54.480> are<00:00:55.070> while<00:00:56.070> these

going<00:01:05.519> around<00:01:05.790> in<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.150> circle<00:01:06.180> on<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.869> outside

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
going around in a circle on the outside

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.060 
going around in a circle on the outside
now<00:01:08.100> on<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:09.000> outside<00:01:09.689> in<00:01:10.110> between<00:01:10.740> all<00:01:10.979> the

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
now on the outside in between all the

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.760 
now on the outside in between all the
defenses<00:01:11.640> there'll<00:01:12.600> be<00:01:12.630> spring<00:01:13.080> traps<00:01:13.439> and

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
defenses there'll be spring traps and

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.570 
defenses there'll be spring traps and
giant<00:01:14.340> bombs<00:01:14.549> so<00:01:15.479> every<00:01:15.689> time<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.900> hog<00:01:16.580> goes

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
giant bombs so every time a hog goes

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.910 
giant bombs so every time a hog goes
over<00:01:17.939> those<00:01:18.119> traps<00:01:18.509> or<00:01:18.720> giant<00:01:19.350> bombs<00:01:19.560> they

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
over those traps or giant bombs they

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.030 
over those traps or giant bombs they
will<00:01:20.280> eliminate<00:01:20.909> a<00:01:21.299> few<00:01:21.540> at<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.080> time<00:01:22.170> sometimes

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
will eliminate a few at a time sometimes

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
will eliminate a few at a time sometimes
a<00:01:23.790> double<00:01:24.509> giant<00:01:24.869> bomb<00:01:25.140> will<00:01:25.890> explode<00:01:26.220> and

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
a double giant bomb will explode and

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.260 
a double giant bomb will explode and
kill<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.540> lot<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:27.990> or<00:01:28.530> most<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:30.000> Hogs

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
kill a lot of or most of the the Hogs

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.510 
kill a lot of or most of the the Hogs
that<00:01:30.540> go<00:01:30.720> over<00:01:30.750> them<00:01:31.170> so<00:01:31.470> sometimes<00:01:32.250> you<00:01:32.369> see<00:01:32.490> a

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
that go over them so sometimes you see a

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.609 
that go over them so sometimes you see a
whole<00:01:32.759> bunch<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.060> hogs<00:01:33.240> I'm<00:01:33.619> disappear

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
whole bunch of hogs I'm disappear

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.069 
whole bunch of hogs I'm disappear
because<00:01:34.860> they<00:01:35.369> have<00:01:35.880> been<00:01:36.090> exploded<00:01:36.570> by<00:01:36.720> a

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
because they have been exploded by a

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.520 
because they have been exploded by a
giant<00:01:37.860> bomb<00:01:38.040> ok<00:01:38.820> so<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.420> best<00:01:39.600> explanation<00:01:39.840> is

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
giant bomb ok so the best explanation is

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.550 
giant bomb ok so the best explanation is
a<00:01:41.100> demonstration<00:01:41.570> so<00:01:42.570> I'm<00:01:43.049> going<00:01:43.290> to<00:01:43.320> show<00:01:43.500> you

is using the textbook hog lower to get
those<00:01:58.140> clan<00:01:58.380> castles<00:01:58.829> out<00:01:59.009> of<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.280> center<00:01:59.610> and

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
those clan castles out of the center and

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.600 
those clan castles out of the center and
lowered<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.049> edge<00:02:01.200> so<00:02:01.680> he<00:02:01.920> can<00:02:02.130> kill<00:02:02.399> them

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610

lowered to the edge so he can kill them
I<00:02:02.850> would<00:02:03.570> explain<00:02:03.869> a<00:02:03.960> little<00:02:04.140> bit<00:02:04.259> more<00:02:04.469> of<00:02:04.680> the

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
I would explain a little bit more of the

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.100 
I would explain a little bit more of the
anti<00:02:05.159> health<00:02:05.310> base<00:02:05.520> so<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.149> Hogs<00:02:06.420> go<00:02:06.780> for<00:02:07.049> the

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
anti health base so the Hogs go for the

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.999 
anti health base so the Hogs go for the
closest<00:02:08.119> defense<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.390> it<00:02:09.539> can<00:02:09.720> find<00:02:10.020> that's

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
closest defense that it can find that's

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.760 
closest defense that it can find that's
why<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.730> outside<00:02:12.180> ring<00:02:12.450> has<00:02:12.870> defenses

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
why the outside ring has defenses

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.520 
why the outside ring has defenses
all<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:13.980> way<00:02:14.100> around<00:02:14.450> because<00:02:15.450> in<00:02:15.720> between

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
all the way around because in between

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.010 
all the way around because in between
the<00:02:16.650> middle<00:02:16.800> and<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.640> outside<00:02:18.090> layer<00:02:18.390> there's

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
the middle and the outside layer there's

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.460 
the middle and the outside layer there's
only<00:02:19.350> there's<00:02:19.830> no<00:02:19.950> defenses<00:02:20.610> so<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:21.720> hogs<00:02:22.260> are

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
only there's no defenses so the hogs are

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.040 
only there's no defenses so the hogs are
likely<00:02:22.980> not<00:02:23.250> to<00:02:23.280> hop<00:02:23.670> into<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.180> center<00:02:24.600> to

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
likely not to hop into the center to

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.370 
likely not to hop into the center to
knock<00:02:25.200> out<00:02:25.410> the<00:02:26.070> Expos<00:02:26.820> and<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.180> mortars<00:02:27.780> so

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
knock out the Expos and the mortars so

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.410 
knock out the Expos and the mortars so
it'll<00:02:28.590> just<00:02:28.620> go<00:02:29.070> all<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.370> way<00:02:29.400> around<00:02:29.490> and<00:02:30.030> get

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
it'll just go all the way around and get

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.480 
it'll just go all the way around and get
picked<00:02:30.690> off<00:02:30.870> by<00:02:31.440> either<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.860> defense<00:02:32.250> in<00:02:32.400> the

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
picked off by either the defense in the

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.780 
picked off by either the defense in the
center<00:02:32.820> or<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.870> traps<00:02:34.830> in<00:02:35.070> between<00:02:35.580> the

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
center or the traps in between the

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.170 
center or the traps in between the
defenses<00:02:36.300> okay<00:02:36.690> so<00:02:36.750> let's<00:02:37.380> have<00:02:37.620> a<00:02:37.680> look<00:02:38.180> after

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
defenses okay so let's have a look after

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.780 
defenses okay so let's have a look after
he<00:02:39.390> has<00:02:39.690> trouble<00:02:40.680> killing<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.580> clan<00:02:41.760> castle

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
he has trouble killing the clan castle

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.700 
he has trouble killing the clan castle
troops<00:02:42.150> and<00:02:42.570> sending<00:02:42.990> in<00:02:43.080> the<00:02:43.140> Hogs<00:02:43.290> right<00:02:43.530> now

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
troops and sending in the Hogs right now

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.070 
troops and sending in the Hogs right now
so<00:02:44.400> he'll<00:02:44.790> find<00:02:45.060> a<00:02:45.120> bomb<00:02:45.360> here<00:02:45.630> yet<00:02:45.870> there's

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
so he'll find a bomb here yet there's

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.720 
so he'll find a bomb here yet there's
one<00:02:46.260> there<00:02:46.530> and<00:02:46.740> then<00:02:47.310> you'll<00:02:47.430> find<00:02:47.640> the

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
one there and then you'll find the

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.910 
one there and then you'll find the
second<00:02:48.090> bomb<00:02:48.240> and<00:02:48.510> that<00:02:49.050> wiped<00:02:49.350> out<00:02:49.440> a<00:02:49.500> few<00:02:49.860> of

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
second bomb and that wiped out a few of

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.040 
second bomb and that wiped out a few of
those<00:02:50.070> homes<00:02:50.370> already<00:02:50.580> and<00:02:50.970> then<00:02:51.600> because<00:02:51.960> he

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
those homes already and then because he

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.510 
those homes already and then because he
started<00:02:52.200> on<00:02:52.380> the<00:02:52.470> corner<00:02:52.830> it'll<00:02:53.010> split<00:02:53.370> up

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
started on the corner it'll split up

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.420 
started on the corner it'll split up
those<00:02:53.700> hogs<00:02:53.940> in<00:02:54.270> half<00:02:54.990> or<00:02:55.350> more<00:02:55.380> than<00:02:55.950> half<00:02:56.160> on

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
those hogs in half or more than half on

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.540 
those hogs in half or more than half on
one<00:02:56.700> side<00:02:56.970> and<00:02:57.240> in<00:02:58.050> between<00:02:58.350> those<00:02:58.980> defenses

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
one side and in between those defenses

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.580 
one side and in between those defenses
he'll<00:02:59.790> find<00:03:00.090> those<00:03:00.270> traps<00:03:00.600> spring<00:03:00.960> traps<00:03:01.320> and

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
he'll find those traps spring traps and

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.920 
he'll find those traps spring traps and
bombs<00:03:02.370> just<00:03:02.700> watch<00:03:02.850> closely<00:03:03.120> the<00:03:03.420> Hogs<00:03:03.660> at<00:03:03.840> the

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
bombs just watch closely the Hogs at the

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.720 
bombs just watch closely the Hogs at the
moment<00:03:04.290> the<00:03:04.680> rest<00:03:04.890> of<00:03:05.010> troops<00:03:05.250> aren't<00:03:05.490> really

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
moment the rest of troops aren't really

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:06.920 
moment the rest of troops aren't really
relevant<00:03:05.850> because<00:03:06.330> I<00:03:06.420> won't<00:03:06.570> be<00:03:06.660> doing<00:03:06.810> much

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
relevant because I won't be doing much

alright<00:03:34.260> let's<00:03:34.470> check<00:03:34.770> this<00:03:34.950> base<00:03:35.610> out<00:03:36.380> it's<00:03:37.380> a

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
alright let's check this base out it's a

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.520 
alright let's check this base out it's a
town<00:03:37.709> hall<00:03:37.890> 8<00:03:38.010> i'm<00:03:38.670> not<00:03:39.060> only<00:03:39.180> anti<00:03:39.900> hog<00:03:40.260> based

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
town hall 8 i'm not only anti hog based

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.370 
town hall 8 i'm not only anti hog based
designs<00:03:40.920> cater<00:03:41.430> for<00:03:41.730> hogs<00:03:41.970> it<00:03:42.690> also<00:03:42.870> caters

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
designs cater for hogs it also caters

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.380 
designs cater for hogs it also caters
for<00:03:43.410> giants<00:03:44.250> as<00:03:44.370> well<00:03:44.550> as<00:03:44.790> i<00:03:44.820> have<00:03:45.090> the<00:03:45.209> same

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
for giants as well as i have the same

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.510 
for giants as well as i have the same
principle<00:03:45.930> their<00:03:46.380> favorite<00:03:46.800> target<00:03:47.220> is<00:03:47.370> the

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:47.520 
principle their favorite target is the

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.780 
principle their favorite target is the
closest<00:03:48.150> defense<00:03:48.690> they<00:03:48.870> can<00:03:49.020> find<00:03:49.350> and<00:03:49.790> watch

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
closest defense they can find and watch

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.790 
closest defense they can find and watch
the<00:03:51.090> raid<00:03:51.300> at<00:03:51.750> the<00:03:51.870> moment<00:03:52.230> focus<00:03:52.560> on<00:03:52.709> the

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
the raid at the moment focus on the

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.730 
the raid at the moment focus on the
giants<00:03:53.220> that<00:03:53.340> he<00:03:53.670> deploys<00:03:54.330> and<00:03:54.690> see<00:03:55.380> what<00:03:55.620> they

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:55.740 
giants that he deploys and see what they

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.199 
giants that he deploys and see what they
do<00:03:55.800> because<00:03:56.160> the<00:03:56.340> other<00:03:56.459> troops<00:03:56.790> don't<00:03:56.970> really

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
do because the other troops don't really

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.800 
do because the other troops don't really
matter<00:03:57.360> for<00:03:57.480> this<00:03:57.720> example<00:03:58.850> so<00:03:59.850> he's<00:04:00.600> going

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810

castle<00:04:05.820> troops<00:04:06.209> which<00:04:06.630> is<00:04:06.780> a<00:04:06.810> big<00:04:07.050> no-no<00:04:07.200> for

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
castle troops which is a big no-no for

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.220 
castle troops which is a big no-no for
Giants<00:04:08.010> and<00:04:08.130> ha<00:04:08.490> grades<00:04:08.790> and<00:04:09.090> he'll<00:04:09.870> find<00:04:10.110> that

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
Giants and ha grades and he'll find that

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.890 
Giants and ha grades and he'll find that
giant<00:04:11.100> bomb<00:04:11.280> that<00:04:11.970> obviously<00:04:12.450> kills<00:04:12.750> those

giant bomb that obviously kills those

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.530 
giant bomb that obviously kills those
giants<00:04:13.380> so<00:04:13.860> now<00:04:14.070> he's<00:04:14.340> sending<00:04:14.970> in<00:04:15.090> some<00:04:15.239> hogs

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
giants so now he's sending in some hogs

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.210 
giants so now he's sending in some hogs
he's<00:04:15.870> got<00:04:15.989> a<00:04:16.020> mixture<00:04:16.260> between<00:04:16.320> hogs<00:04:16.830> and

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
he's got a mixture between hogs and

he's got a mixture between hogs and
Giants<00:04:17.669> at<00:04:17.760> the<00:04:17.790> moment<00:04:18.209> and<00:04:18.359> just<00:04:19.140> focus<00:04:19.470> on

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
Giants at the moment and just focus on

Giants at the moment and just focus on
the<00:04:19.680> Hogs<00:04:19.830> now<00:04:20.100> and<00:04:20.370> see<00:04:21.060> what<00:04:21.239> they<00:04:21.390> do<00:04:21.450> and

outer<00:04:25.919> layer<00:04:26.220> ring

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
outer layer ring

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.010 
outer layer ring
and<00:04:27.530> the<00:04:28.530> middle<00:04:29.360> defense<00:04:30.360> is<00:04:30.539> shooting<00:04:30.870> them

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
and the middle defense is shooting them

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.469

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:35.729 
between those defenses here we go

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:37.999 
between those defenses here we go
there's<00:04:35.969> a<00:04:36.000> giant<00:04:36.300> bomb<00:04:36.449> now<00:04:36.770> destroys<00:04:37.770> that

00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:38.009 
there's a giant bomb now destroys that

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:40.249 
there's a giant bomb now destroys that
last<00:04:38.250> group<00:04:38.460> of<00:04:38.699> hogs<00:04:39.629> and<00:04:39.930> you'll<00:04:40.020> set

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:40.259 
last group of hogs and you'll set

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:42.529 
last group of hogs and you'll set
another<00:04:40.500> group<00:04:40.830> from<00:04:41.520> the<00:04:41.699> other<00:04:41.879> side<00:04:42.180> and

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
just watch the rest the Hogs now and you

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.350 
just watch the rest the Hogs now and you
will<00:04:46.620> see<00:04:46.889> them<00:04:47.099> dwindle<00:04:47.610> the<00:04:47.729> numbers<00:04:48.120> and

will see them dwindle the numbers and

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.619 
will see them dwindle the numbers and
eventually<00:04:48.900> go<00:04:49.500> to<00:04:49.560> zero<00:04:50.210> all<00:04:51.210> right<00:04:51.389> so

00:04:51.619 --> 00:04:51.629 
eventually go to zero all right so

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:54.110 
eventually go to zero all right so
there's<00:04:51.990> an<00:04:52.139> there's<00:04:52.439> only<00:04:52.620> one<00:04:52.770> left<00:04:53.189> and<00:04:53.610> bam

base design is and i want you guys to

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.600 
base design is and i want you guys to
know<00:05:12.150> that<00:05:12.330> anti<00:05:13.020> hog<00:05:13.199> bases<00:05:13.650> can<00:05:14.069> be<00:05:14.099> still

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
know that anti hog bases can be still

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.629 
know that anti hog bases can be still
rated<00:05:14.849> by<00:05:15.150> hogs<00:05:15.509> or<00:05:16.110> giants<00:05:16.710> but<00:05:17.280> there<00:05:17.460> is<00:05:17.490> a

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:17.639 
rated by hogs or giants but there is a

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:20.029 
rated by hogs or giants but there is a
tactic<00:05:18.240> on<00:05:18.389> how<00:05:18.599> to<00:05:18.659> do<00:05:18.900> that<00:05:19.080> and<00:05:19.319> i'll<00:05:19.680> show
