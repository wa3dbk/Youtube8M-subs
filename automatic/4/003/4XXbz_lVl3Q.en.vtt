your torso the reverse wood shop or the
Wood<00:00:17.800> chop<00:00:18.160> let's<00:00:18.400> check<00:00:18.640> out<00:00:18.759> the<00:00:18.880> technique

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:19.210 
Wood chop let's check out the technique

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.109 
Wood chop let's check out the technique
start<00:00:19.990> with<00:00:20.140> a<00:00:20.169> wide<00:00:20.410> base<00:00:20.680> outside

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
start with a wide base outside

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.880 
start with a wide base outside
shoulder-width<00:00:22.119> stand<00:00:22.900> one<00:00:23.199> two<00:00:23.350> three<00:00:23.590> feet

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:23.890 
shoulder-width stand one two three feet

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.400 
shoulder-width stand one two three feet
away<00:00:24.099> from<00:00:24.369> the<00:00:24.640> cable<00:00:25.060> with<00:00:25.570> your<00:00:25.750> feet<00:00:26.019> hips

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.410 
away from the cable with your feet hips

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.589 
away from the cable with your feet hips
and<00:00:26.710> head<00:00:26.890> square<00:00:27.310> this<00:00:27.550> is<00:00:27.730> a<00:00:27.760> pool<00:00:28.090> movement

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:28.599 
and head square this is a pool movement

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:30.480

there's<00:01:08.200> many<00:01:08.440> mistakes<00:01:08.800> that<00:01:08.979> could<00:01:09.130> be<00:01:09.250> done

00:01:09.449 --> 00:01:09.459 
there's many mistakes that could be done

00:01:09.459 --> 00:01:11.460 
there's many mistakes that could be done
in<00:01:09.580> this<00:01:09.700> exercise<00:01:10.090> but<00:01:10.899> the<00:01:10.959> biggest<00:01:11.170> of<00:01:11.380> the

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
in this exercise but the biggest of the

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.490 
in this exercise but the biggest of the
two<00:01:11.590> will<00:01:11.740> be<00:01:11.770> not<00:01:12.039> shifting<00:01:12.520> of<00:01:12.640> the<00:01:12.670> legs

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.730 

now<00:01:15.650> keeping<00:01:16.040> the<00:01:16.130> hips<00:01:16.310> and<00:01:16.520> head<00:01:16.730> square

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.230 

far<00:01:19.860> as<00:01:19.950> implementing<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.579> Wood<00:01:20.790> chop<00:01:21.060> and

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
far as implementing the Wood chop and

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.230 
far as implementing the Wood chop and
reverse<00:01:21.540> woodshop<00:01:21.930> into<00:01:22.439> our<00:01:22.909> programming<00:01:23.909> we

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
reverse woodshop into our programming we

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.330 
reverse woodshop into our programming we
would<00:01:24.600> use<00:01:24.750> this<00:01:24.899> as<00:01:25.110> typically<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.799> auxilary

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
would use this as typically a auxilary

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.820 
would use this as typically a auxilary
type<00:01:26.759> movement<00:01:27.270> where<00:01:27.689> we<00:01:27.990> can<00:01:28.170> increase<00:01:28.560> the

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
type movement where we can increase the

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.440 
type movement where we can increase the
intensity<00:01:29.250> make<00:01:29.549> it<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.729> little<00:01:29.880> bit<00:01:30.060> heavier

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
intensity make it a little bit heavier

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.600 
intensity make it a little bit heavier
but<00:01:30.630> we<00:01:31.020> want<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.290> decrease<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:32.040> volume<00:01:32.280> this

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
but we want to decrease the volume this

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.580 
but we want to decrease the volume this
would<00:01:32.820> look<00:01:32.970> like<00:01:33.210> five<00:01:33.570> sets<00:01:34.049> of<00:01:34.320> five

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
would look like five sets of five

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.950 
would look like five sets of five
repetitions<00:01:35.250> or<00:01:35.939> maybe<00:01:36.479> even<00:01:36.600> lower

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
repetitions or maybe even lower

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.550 
repetitions or maybe even lower
depending<00:01:37.439> on<00:01:37.530> how<00:01:37.710> heavy<00:01:38.009> you<00:01:38.250> go<00:01:39.560> normally

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
depending on how heavy you go normally

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.590 
depending on how heavy you go normally
what<00:01:40.710> we<00:01:40.799> do<00:01:40.979> use<00:01:41.220> it<00:01:41.369> though<00:01:41.520> is<00:01:41.789> a<00:01:42.299> low

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
what we do use it though is a low

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.880 
what we do use it though is a low
intensity<00:01:43.110> where<00:01:43.350> we're<00:01:43.439> going<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.619> lighten

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
intensity where we're going to lighten

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.230 
intensity where we're going to lighten
the<00:01:44.100> load<00:01:44.130> we're<00:01:44.520> going<00:01:44.640> to<00:01:44.700> implement<00:01:44.909> this

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
the load we're going to implement this

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.389 
the load we're going to implement this
motor<00:01:45.539> pattern<00:01:46.020> we<00:01:46.500> might<00:01:46.679> go<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:46.950> little<00:01:47.220> bit

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
motor pattern we might go a little bit

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.460 
motor pattern we might go a little bit
higher<00:01:47.549> volume<00:01:48.119> as<00:01:48.240> far<00:01:48.450> as<00:01:48.539> repetition<00:01:49.170> so<00:01:49.350> we

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
higher volume as far as repetition so we

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.090 
higher volume as far as repetition so we
might<00:01:49.710> go<00:01:50.270> three<00:01:51.270> sets<00:01:51.600> of<00:01:51.689> ten<00:01:52.200> or<00:01:52.619> maybe<00:01:52.979> even

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
might go three sets of ten or maybe even

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.980 
might go three sets of ten or maybe even
a<00:01:53.310> little<00:01:53.549> bit<00:01:53.640> higher<00:01:53.850> than<00:01:54.119> that<00:01:54.179> now

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
a little bit higher than that now

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.270 
a little bit higher than that now
there's<00:01:55.170> so<00:01:55.319> many<00:01:55.440> benefits<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.159> this

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
there's so many benefits to this

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.430 
there's so many benefits to this
exercise<00:01:56.789> including<00:01:57.390> force<00:01:57.959> coupling

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
exercise including force coupling

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.070 
exercise including force coupling
