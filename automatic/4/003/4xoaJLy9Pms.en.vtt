called<00:03:08.490> the<00:03:08.580> data<00:03:08.910> protocol<00:03:09.570> which<00:03:09.810> I<00:03:09.990> believe

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
called the data protocol which I believe

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.830 
called the data protocol which I believe
is<00:03:10.440> Ultron<00:03:10.920> so<00:03:11.310> is<00:03:11.490> this<00:03:11.670> mostly<00:03:11.970> so<00:03:12.360> that<00:03:12.540> TV

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
is Ultron so is this mostly so that TV

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.880 
is Ultron so is this mostly so that TV
show<00:03:12.930> uh<00:03:12.990> supposed<00:03:13.200> to<00:03:13.230> wait<00:03:13.380> up<00:03:13.500> until<00:03:13.770> this

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:28.200 
Avengers movie for some reason I think
