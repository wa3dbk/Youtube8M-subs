00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 hi guys the card game you are 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.710
 seeing is called infinite forms and I have it 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.380
 created for the clementoni blog 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.170
 through a paper toy or a game of 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.059
 paper that you can print and download 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.390
 now let's see how I made it like 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.369
 it works this is the sheet you print 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.350
 right from the web as I saw printed 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.350
 sorry unfortunately as a printer in 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.150
 black and white and also in color but a 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.060
 colors and well this step instructions 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.830
 step is good that now we see well that 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.450
 in color these cards are and 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.579
 cards that must be at least of 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.730
 a weight of 120 grams because then 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.620
 paper is enough to make 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.649
 the different defined shapes you have 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.719
 seen some of which you have had 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.340
 way to see them with the introductory video 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.809
 previously showed here at 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.649
 There are others at the end of this video 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.030
 examples 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.129
 made these prints in the we find ourselves 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.770
 already ready-made paper strips 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.930
 which I have already prepared with the lines lines 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.910
 canteen where you can then go to 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.379
 then print to cut out carefully 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.000
 with scissors 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.379
 I recommend rounded tip or 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.060
 with a cutter if you want to be 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.310
 still precise and in this case aims 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.600
 when it takes precision because then i 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.220
 pieces will be placed next to one another 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.200
 to the other and owe the lengths 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.259
 absolutely height width 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.009
 match as you see we do 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:19.950
 in this case we cut out I chose 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.799
 had the red and green yellow cards 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.500
 blue is used to make the 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.810
 our endlessly shaped game you can 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.759
 obviously then go also to decorate 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.250
 and customize maybe insert some 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.250
 Numbers letters and so on 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.380
 give it a richer look and more 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.180
 playful to this game of forms 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.220
 endless to download the pdf more 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.220
 left the link below 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.200
 in the descriptions to this video of 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.700
 all information made to it 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.159
 these bits and folded 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.049
 carefully as you have seen along the 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.840
 dashed lines that you find right 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.490
 in the press I have to go to fix 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.990
 these triangles like scotch pieces 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.750
 and I used scotch tape 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.079
 transparent also quite rather 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.579
 wide so you can do it 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:07.619
 then cut to methane and have the 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.330
 last a little wider than what the 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.979
 classic scotch and typical transparent 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.900
 let's say why 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.690
 the newsstand that uses school etc. 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.970
 this to give more support to make 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.459
 more rigid the game therefore also for 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.489
 make it easier just from from 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:25.220
 achieve and I did so for all 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:27.620
 two colors for four colors the eight 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.420
 little triangles very slowly ok when aiming 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.430
 calmly and precisely because later 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.200
 best result but I manage to 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.000
 handle the game of infinite shapes 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.310
 once done all this what i do 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.930
 I put them in this order by one 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.459
 all the others left 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.129
 on the other side to the right 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:46.220
 I take other scotch pieces like 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:48.200
 you see I go to insert and create them 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.230
 of couples two by two 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.470
 here they are in a pair up here one 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.810
 couple below 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.519
 then now I go to the top right with the 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.340
 big fan theme can not mess up 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:03.290
 things is just a bungling moment of the 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.819
 I always work there, though 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.269
 the commitment in the end turned out to be there 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:08.720
 guys ok then now another piece of 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.940
 Scotch tape 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.560
 here it is we have created so we are 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.599
 four different groups these two i 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.340
 calls to create two groups 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:17.780
 only then did you see we were 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.880
 also the movement that must make the 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.139
 own paper object that 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.299
 let's go home once 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:25.700
 then all these we have here is the 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:28.099
 green on yellow perfect movement where 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.970
 go and connect them all then to 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:30.470
 new 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.419
 I take the scotch that maybe I have 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.310
 prepared for not in naked cases 

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:35.989
 stick the scotches with the etc. 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.980
 scissors and so on and here's result 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:38.389
 the final 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.430
 having done this, the point remains only 

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:42.049
 don't move your hands anymore 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.880
 because it is beautiful to really experience the 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:45.440
 coffins and different shapes I could 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.660
 make with this game of shapes 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.310
 infinite I await the next 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:50.750
 call for this information you can 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.849
 write in below in the comments vi 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.769
 I remember you can go to download it 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:56.209
