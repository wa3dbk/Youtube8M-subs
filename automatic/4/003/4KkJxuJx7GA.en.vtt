00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.370
 you also organize sessions 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.509
 cayenne and gold what does this 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.410
 session is to transmit your 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.660
 know 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.420
 I started organizing events 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.849
 at the age of 17 because in fact with 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.949
 the arrival of online I had more and 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.380
 more envied to share this passion 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.289
 there with players but in real life 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.480
 offline as they say and suddenly I 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.090
 found a room on paris we reacted 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.090
 organized this with about fifty 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.850
 early players after that is to go 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:34.280
 around 200 players on paris always 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.080
 to confront game players from 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.430
 fight to train especially to have fun 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.960
 because there is no competition 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.270
 it's really a session 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.800
 workout together and then I 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.930
 developed that outside Paris 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.879
 so there I have a lot in the south by 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.100
 example I'm going to Montpellier soon 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:50.780
 and jean-pierre one there okay and 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.510
 with children too I want you 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.800
 do a little bit of pedagogy 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.699
 because you also defend 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.550
 video game values 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:02.630
 oh yeah I won white is associated 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.890
 the decline in schools to metz and that's 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.509
 amazing because I was expecting 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.700
 really not at such a welcome from 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:13.009
 children I was afraid of boring them 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:14.240
 or what in fact I did not know I say 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:17.660
 that it may be another 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.630
 generation who knows and actually yes there is 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:23.020
 two weeks I was in ermont for in 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.880
 the youth space where there were 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.470
 consoles to me and some fighting games that 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.270
 fighting games from elsewhere and a 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.950
 small scene where we could face 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.600
 what are the virtues of a fighting game 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.630
 because a priori in July good 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:43.160
 rather violent question then not the 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:45.800
 all violent I do not think I do 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.569
 the devil's advocate but yes in fact I 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.789
 really think that already to educate the 

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:51.200
 children or even when we go in a 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:52.610
 combat tournament there are always the 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.709
 same values it's always the 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.899
 determination fair play the desire to 

00:01:54.709 --> 00:02:00.050
 exceed all the time to be better 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:02.060
 of give their all to win 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.940
 and his character because we have gold 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:07.640
 and because we want to prove that our 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.709
 training really allowed to be 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.550
 among the best or at least to have 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.550
 does better than the previous time
