 cadena3 the most open television that 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.649
 never 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:10.469
 it will be published that mara escalator had 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.139
 voluntarily followed the rights of the 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:17.740
 character of albertano ariel miramontes 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:20.590
 the actor clarifies if this is true 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.779
 we are negotiating so that I have the 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.450
 rights of the character we need 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:27.490
 just the stop levels for me 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.770
 invites to work with her in a show 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:34.439
 called clothes hanging a lot ago 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.439
 time she already had the idea 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:41.449
 that these angels had a boyfriend 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:45.570
 this is in cabaret for standox and sketch 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:47.269
 then I already had the idea that I had 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.129
 a boyfriend named albertano 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:52.409
 so yes it was an idea of ​​mara 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.360
 alberta character is not something that I 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:57.329
 I have to recognize and I also have to 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:01.170
 recognize that he taught me a lot of things 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.839
 and I was 10 years old and I already had another one 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.289
 so not being average peak and then 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:09.090
 she sheltered me in that sense and emerged 

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:11.070
 our half when she invited me to 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.030
 do this character but somehow 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.740
 way then the character me and I 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.310
 I gave him characteristics I think so too 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.289
 not then it's like it's a son and 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.300
 then they will sit down to sign papers 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:25.890
 corresponding to see regarding the 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.790
 session of rights 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:32.090
 exactly that when you go in ariel 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:35.330
 I do not know how to say in our days 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.750
 that's just going to be directly with 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.750
 lawyers 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:45.579
 if you need a lawyer yes but not the 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.920
 there is 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:51.189
 they will arrive at the courts if I do not know what 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.020
 as much and they do it as seeing everything as a 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:55.600
 very serious problem and really 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.060
 only one difference and already the 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.890
