00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:05.810
 and now another service run by the 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.280
 pan a show 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:13.280
 this is a puma instrument panel 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:19.500
 gt and we also find the model gt 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:21.359
 and in gts the customization created here 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:27.539
 It was a black background with the numbers 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:32.430
 whites original spelling and lighting 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:35.850
 green then by day we have the panel with 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.950
 black background the white and leaked numbers 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.370
 At night we have the numbers ascending 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.350
 untruth 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:47.820
 in this customizations were used 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:52.430
 five leds in these two segments 5 in the 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.430
 and one in each marker 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:00.420
 again one off we keep all the 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:04.019
 original characteristics which are the 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:13.040
 interesting final tracks 41 200 beds 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:13.040
 we will now see the contagion 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:31.219
 also infected with excellent results 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:32.780
 maintaining all original and 

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:36.909
 other things can be used too 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:41.319
 blue and white is a color 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:47.950
 Lately lots of red searching 

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:52.549
 orange and green is the most common 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.689
 been asked over the years for the most 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:57.229
 conservatives 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:58.129
 so we have all the spelling in the pattern 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:02.289
 original 

00:01:58.129 --> 00:02:02.289
 now let's see the markers we have 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:35.140
 the oil pressure killer in the kit 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:39.190
 We even send the stickers that go 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:41.950
 in that part above the original plate 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:47.489
 many are well deteriorated over time 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:49.870
 a 1 will have a full effect there 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:52.420
 attaching this upper part 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:56.040
 all components are in acrylic are 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.040
 Translucent plates so here 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.550
 now we will see the temperature marker 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.310
 it's a great result 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:31.460
 in the end we will see the marker of 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:31.460
 fuel 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:52.280
 and here with pressure on the video 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:56.060
 explanatory on the personalization of 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:59.770
 cougar instruments gt s 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.770
 the gt is
