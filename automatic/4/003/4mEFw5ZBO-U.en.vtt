00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:06.740 

ok<00:00:05.130> the<00:00:05.279> next<00:00:05.310> dog<00:00:05.700> really<00:00:05.910> want<00:00:06.210> to<00:00:06.300> go<00:00:06.450> over

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
ok the next dog really want to go over

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.369 
ok the next dog really want to go over
is<00:00:06.960> one<00:00:07.200> of<00:00:07.350> the<00:00:07.529> dot<00:00:07.799> whole<00:00:08.549> else<00:00:09.379> it's

00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:10.379 
is one of the dot whole else it's

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:12.080 
is one of the dot whole else it's
actually<00:00:10.500> price<00:00:10.950> quite<00:00:11.429> simple<00:00:11.880> when<00:00:12.059> you

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
actually price quite simple when you

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.350 
actually price quite simple when you
break<00:00:12.360> it<00:00:12.389> down<00:00:12.570> and<00:00:13.080> if<00:00:13.230> you<00:00:13.349> learn<00:00:13.620> this<00:00:13.920> one

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:14.360 
break it down and if you learn this one

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.330 
break it down and if you learn this one
it's<00:00:15.360> going<00:00:15.599> to<00:00:15.660> lead<00:00:15.900> into<00:00:16.139> two<00:00:16.529> more<00:00:16.860> because

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
it's going to lead into two more because

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.500 
it's going to lead into two more because
the<00:00:17.520> bulk<00:00:17.759> of<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.300> algorithm<00:00:18.779> is<00:00:18.990> used<00:00:20.240> in<00:00:21.240> two

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
the bulk of the algorithm is used in two

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.599 
the bulk of the algorithm is used in two
into<00:00:22.080> two<00:00:22.439> more<00:00:22.770> will<00:00:22.920> show<00:00:23.220> in<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.460> next

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
into two more will show in the next

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.620 
into two more will show in the next
video<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.330> then<00:00:24.750> a<00:00:24.779> video<00:00:25.080> after<00:00:25.500> that<00:00:26.630> so

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
video and then a video after that so

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.019 
video and then a video after that so
we'll<00:00:27.840> get<00:00:27.960> right<00:00:28.199> into<00:00:28.380> it<00:00:28.859> can<00:00:29.490> be<00:00:29.580> done<00:00:29.730> from

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
we'll get right into it can be done from

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.640 
we'll get right into it can be done from
either<00:00:30.330> way<00:00:31.610> but<00:00:32.610> from<00:00:32.850> this<00:00:32.970> angle<00:00:33.210> or<00:00:34.110> this

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:34.650 
either way but from this angle or this

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.389 
either way but from this angle or this
angle<00:00:35.040> because<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.610> symmetry<00:00:37.340> so<00:00:38.340> I'll

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
angle because of the symmetry so I'll

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.440 
angle because of the symmetry so I'll
get<00:00:38.550> straight<00:00:38.610> into<00:00:39.030> it<00:00:39.180> ah<00:00:41.030> you<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.360> our<00:00:43.290> prime

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450 
get straight into it ah you to our prime

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.590 
get straight into it ah you to our prime
slide<00:00:45.450> channel<00:00:45.780> which<00:00:45.930> is<00:00:46.079> our<00:00:46.320> prime<00:00:46.649> f<00:00:46.920> 0<00:00:47.370> f

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
slide channel which is our prime f 0 f

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.760 
slide channel which is our prime f 0 f
prime<00:00:49.039> you<00:00:50.039> two<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.750> sledgehammer<00:00:52.200> again

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
prime you two and a sledgehammer again

00:00:52.770 --> 00:01:02.510 
prime you two and a sledgehammer again
is<00:00:53.370> our<00:00:53.789> prime<00:00:54.180> F<00:00:55.399> F<00:00:56.399> prime<00:01:00.710> the<00:01:01.710> reason<00:01:02.070> why<00:01:02.489> I

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
is our prime F F prime the reason why I

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.420 
is our prime F F prime the reason why I
do<00:01:02.760> our<00:01:03.390> prime<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.140> then<00:01:04.350> our<00:01:04.559> prime<00:01:04.830> again<00:01:05.190> is

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
do our prime and then our prime again is

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.300 
do our prime and then our prime again is
for<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.180> benefit<00:01:06.630> of<00:01:06.840> remembering<00:01:07.439> because

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
for the benefit of remembering because

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.200 
for the benefit of remembering because
if<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.549> see<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.420> algorithm<00:01:09.900> on<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.200> screen

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
if you see the algorithm on the screen

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.350 
if you see the algorithm on the screen
it's<00:01:12.210> basically<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.750> set<00:01:13.470> up<00:01:13.560> move

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
it's basically a set up move

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.070 
it's basically a set up move
sledgehammer<00:01:15.360> you<00:01:16.260> too<00:01:16.500> slow<00:01:17.070> channel<00:01:18.020> so<00:01:19.020> if

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
sledgehammer you too slow channel so if

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.359 
sledgehammer you too slow channel so if
we<00:01:19.140> look<00:01:19.170> at<00:01:19.350> it<00:01:19.500> one<00:01:19.619> more<00:01:19.770> time<00:01:20.009> are<00:01:20.840> you<00:01:21.840> to

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
we look at it one more time are you to

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:28.190 
we look at it one more time are you to
our<00:01:23.369> prime<00:01:24.049> and<00:01:25.909> then<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.030> sledgehammer<00:01:27.479> our

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
our prime and then the sledgehammer our

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.770 
our prime and then the sledgehammer our
prime<00:01:28.650> F<00:01:29.180> R<00:01:30.180> f<00:01:30.810> prime<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.979> too<00:01:32.450> so<00:01:33.450> camera

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
prime F R f prime you too so camera

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:42.289 
prime F R f prime you too so camera
again<00:01:33.840> our<00:01:34.560> prime<00:01:35.130> F<00:01:35.430> our<00:01:36.470> F<00:01:37.470> prime<00:01:39.170> and<00:01:41.150> how<00:01:42.150> it

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
again our prime F our F prime and how it

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:51.560 
again our prime F our F prime and how it
should<00:01:42.509> be<00:01:42.540> performed<00:01:46.520> is<00:01:47.520> are<00:01:48.439> you<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:50.570> then

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
should be performed is are you to then

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.569 
should be performed is are you to then
the<00:01:51.689> red<00:01:51.869> grip<00:01:52.140> keep<00:01:52.710> your<00:01:52.979> finger<00:01:53.280> on<00:01:53.310> the

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
the red grip keep your finger on the

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.609 
the red grip keep your finger on the
bottom<00:01:53.990> here<00:01:54.990> so<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:55.920> can<00:01:56.220> go<00:01:56.399> hard<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:57.619> into

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
bottom here so you can go hard to into

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.980 
bottom here so you can go hard to into
the<00:01:58.710> sledgehammer<00:01:59.219> f<00:02:00.560> F<00:02:01.560> prime<00:02:02.130> you<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:03.270> your

the sledgehammer f F prime you to your

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.499 
the sledgehammer f F prime you to your
left<00:02:04.140> finger<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:04.939> then<00:02:05.939> our<00:02:06.869> prime<00:02:07.290> F<00:02:07.950> our<00:02:08.509> F

left finger and then our prime F our F

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.860 
left finger and then our prime F our F
