pull back if you want we'll explore
today<00:00:19.199> how<00:00:19.529> we<00:00:19.590> can<00:00:19.859> use<00:00:20.100> basic<00:00:20.640> unix<00:00:20.939> commands

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
today how we can use basic unix commands

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.320 
today how we can use basic unix commands
to<00:00:21.660> navigate<00:00:21.689> in<00:00:22.230> finder<00:00:22.880> we<00:00:23.880> will<00:00:24.029> use<00:00:24.180> the

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
to navigate in finder we will use the

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.240 
to navigate in finder we will use the
go-to<00:00:24.539> dialog<00:00:25.050> window<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.710> open<00:00:25.740> it<00:00:26.099> the

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
go-to dialog window to open it the

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.160 
go-to dialog window to open it the
keyboard<00:00:26.640> shortcut<00:00:27.000> is<00:00:27.150> shift<00:00:27.449> command<00:00:27.779> G<00:00:27.960> so

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
keyboard shortcut is shift command G so

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.310 
keyboard shortcut is shift command G so
let's<00:00:28.349> use<00:00:28.560> it<00:00:28.590> shift<00:00:29.099> command<00:00:29.490> G<00:00:30.199> there<00:00:31.199> you

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
let's use it shift command G there you

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.850 
let's use it shift command G there you
have<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:31.500> go<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.520> folder<00:00:32.759> dialog<00:00:33.420> window

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:33.860 
have it go to the folder dialog window

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.069 
have it go to the folder dialog window
right<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.820> purpose<00:00:36.210> of<00:00:36.329> this<00:00:36.390> command<00:00:36.840> is<00:00:37.020> to
