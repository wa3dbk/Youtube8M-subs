00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:26.380 
logo so I'm going to start with two

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:27.870 
logo so I'm going to start with two
lines<00:00:26.650> on<00:00:26.830> the<00:00:26.920> sides<00:00:27.100> of<00:00:27.220> my<00:00:27.280> nails<00:00:27.520> and<00:00:27.760> these

lines on the sides of my nails and these

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.880 
lines on the sides of my nails and these
will<00:00:28.060> be<00:00:28.150> for<00:00:28.420> like<00:00:28.840> a<00:00:28.869> frame<00:00:29.199> of<00:00:29.230> reference<00:00:29.380> so

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:29.890 
will be for like a frame of reference so

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.470 
will be for like a frame of reference so
i<00:00:29.920> know<00:00:30.039> where<00:00:30.250> i'm<00:00:30.340> starting<00:00:30.699> with<00:00:30.850> and<00:00:31.060> then

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.480 
i know where i'm starting with and then

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.119 
i know where i'm starting with and then
i'm<00:00:31.570> going<00:00:31.750> to<00:00:31.810> move<00:00:31.960> down<00:00:31.990> to<00:00:32.379> the<00:00:32.410> middle<00:00:32.890> and

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:33.129 
i'm going to move down to the middle and

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:36.750 
i'm going to move down to the middle and
the<00:00:33.489> bottom<00:00:33.519> and<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:35.350> bottom<00:00:35.379> of<00:00:35.949> the<00:00:36.219> DW

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760 
the bottom and the bottom of the DW

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.639 
the bottom and the bottom of the DW
points<00:00:37.329> down<00:00:37.569> towards<00:00:37.929> the<00:00:37.960> tip<00:00:38.170> and<00:00:38.379> the<00:00:38.440> top

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:38.649 
points down towards the tip and the top

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:40.319 
points down towards the tip and the top
of<00:00:38.829> it<00:00:38.949> points<00:00:39.219> up<00:00:39.370> towards<00:00:39.670> your<00:00:39.699> cuticle<00:00:40.210> and

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:40.329 
of it points up towards your cuticle and

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:42.450 
of it points up towards your cuticle and
so<00:00:40.839> the<00:00:41.019> sides<00:00:41.319> are<00:00:41.800> the<00:00:41.829> bottom<00:00:42.159> of<00:00:42.219> the<00:00:42.280> top

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.460 
so the sides are the bottom of the top

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.469 
so the sides are the bottom of the top
of<00:00:42.609> the<00:00:42.760> letters<00:00:43.539> are<00:00:43.749> on<00:00:44.440> an<00:00:44.620> angle<00:00:45.300> so<00:00:46.300> as<00:00:46.329> you

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:46.479 
of the letters are on an angle so as you

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:47.969 
of the letters are on an angle so as you
can<00:00:46.569> see<00:00:46.749> how<00:00:46.870> i'm<00:00:47.050> painting<00:00:47.289> those<00:00:47.530> angles

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:47.979 
can see how i'm painting those angles

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:50.279 
can see how i'm painting those angles
and<00:00:48.389> this<00:00:49.389> make<00:00:49.629> it<00:00:49.780> almost<00:00:50.019> look<00:00:50.260> like

00:00:50.279 --> 00:00:50.289 
and this make it almost look like

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:51.950 
and this make it almost look like
they're<00:00:50.739> three<00:00:51.010> dimensional<00:00:51.519> it'll<00:00:51.729> give<00:00:51.879> a

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
they're three dimensional it'll give a

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.989 
they're three dimensional it'll give a
kind<00:00:52.960> of<00:00:53.049> a<00:00:53.109> cool<00:00:53.289> little<00:00:53.559> effect<00:00:53.920> so<00:00:54.699> then<00:00:54.879> i'm

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:54.999 
kind of a cool little effect so then i'm

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:56.340 
kind of a cool little effect so then i'm
going<00:00:55.089> to<00:00:55.149> be<00:00:55.269> adding<00:00:55.569> those<00:00:55.870> lines<00:00:56.109> in<00:00:56.289> the

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
going to be adding those lines in the

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.110 
going to be adding those lines in the
middle<00:00:56.559> and<00:00:56.679> if<00:00:56.889> these<00:00:57.190> all<00:00:57.429> get<00:00:57.850> kind<00:00:58.059> of

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
middle and if these all get kind of

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.309 
middle and if these all get kind of
messed<00:00:58.299> up<00:00:58.420> you<00:00:58.510> can<00:00:58.629> always<00:00:58.989> fix<00:00:59.139> them<00:00:59.289> later

00:00:59.309 --> 00:00:59.319 
messed up you can always fix them later

00:00:59.319 --> 00:01:01.289 
messed up you can always fix them later

without<00:01:23.920> filling<00:01:24.430> it<00:01:24.549> in<00:01:24.640> because<00:01:24.909> it's<00:01:25.240> not

00:01:25.349 --> 00:01:25.359 
without filling it in because it's not

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:27.660 
without filling it in because it's not
that<00:01:25.420> difficult<00:01:25.780> just<00:01:26.200> to<00:01:26.320> fill<00:01:26.979> in<00:01:27.159> around<00:01:27.280> it

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
that difficult just to fill in around it

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.230 
that difficult just to fill in around it
so<00:01:27.909> much<00:01:28.060> and<00:01:29.189> you<00:01:30.189> also<00:01:30.609> have<00:01:30.729> to<00:01:30.850> add<00:01:31.030> a

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
so much and you also have to add a

00:01:31.240 --> 00:02:00.700 
so much and you also have to add a
little<00:01:31.450> like<00:01:31.990> little<00:01:32.350> nubs<00:01:32.649> on<00:01:32.859> the<00:01:33.039> end<00:01:33.189> of<00:01:33.429> d

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.370 

and<00:02:01.100> then<00:02:01.520> there's<00:02:01.670> also<00:02:01.820> a<00:02:02.090> little<00:02:02.540> point<00:02:03.140> on

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
and then there's also a little point on

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:11.830 
and then there's also a little point on
the<00:02:03.680> top<00:02:09.940> so<00:02:10.940> then<00:02:11.090> as<00:02:11.240> I<00:02:11.390> mentioned<00:02:11.750> with

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
the top so then as I mentioned with

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.180 
the top so then as I mentioned with
white<00:02:11.990> paint<00:02:12.170> you<00:02:12.380> can<00:02:12.530> fix<00:02:12.709> any<00:02:12.950> of<00:02:13.040> your

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
white paint you can fix any of your

mistakes that you have like I have those

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.229 
mistakes that you have like I have those
two<00:02:15.470> little<00:02:15.709> dots<00:02:16.010> that<00:02:16.340> just<00:02:16.940> sort<00:02:17.120> of

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
two little dots that just sort of

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:19.210 
two little dots that just sort of
created<00:02:17.810> themselves<00:02:17.959> and<00:02:18.410> then<00:02:18.920> add<00:02:19.069> the

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
created themselves and then add the

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:50.740 
created themselves and then add the
prongs<00:02:19.459> in<00:02:19.670> the<00:02:19.700> w

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.000 

and<00:02:50.840> then<00:02:51.020> on<00:02:51.200> your<00:02:51.290> point<00:02:51.530> your<00:02:51.680> middle<00:02:51.890> and
