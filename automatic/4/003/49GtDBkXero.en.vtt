when it's not capture the flag I'm act
like<00:02:12.260> that<00:02:12.549> probably<00:02:13.549> i<00:02:13.609> do<00:02:13.669> scab

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
like that probably i do scab

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
stopping power copy ninja I don't I

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.500 
stopping power copy ninja I don't I
usually<00:02:19.490> do<00:02:19.610> a<00:02:19.640> little<00:02:19.790> bit<00:02:19.910> came<00:02:20.030> for<00:02:20.209> myself

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
usually do a little bit came for myself

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.800 
usually do a little bit came for myself
too<00:02:20.690> okay<00:02:21.650> see<00:02:22.280> I'm<00:02:22.400> using<00:02:22.430> i<00:02:23.120> think<00:02:23.600> i'm<00:02:23.720> using

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
too okay see I'm using i think i'm using

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.720 
too okay see I'm using i think i'm using
sleight<00:02:24.200> of<00:02:24.230> hand<00:02:24.590> stopping<00:02:25.280> power<00:02:25.520> and

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
sleight of hand stopping power and

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.000 
sleight of hand stopping power and
steady<00:02:26.000> aim<00:02:26.209> i'm<00:02:26.510> not<00:02:26.630> too<00:02:26.780> sure<00:02:26.810> because<00:02:27.680> it's

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
steady aim i'm not too sure because it's

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.120 
steady aim i'm not too sure because it's
not<00:02:28.130> on<00:02:28.250> the<00:02:28.310> screen<00:02:28.550> right<00:02:28.700> now<00:02:28.760> but<00:02:30.130> yeah

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
not on the screen right now but yeah

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.670 
not on the screen right now but yeah
this<00:02:31.370> this<00:02:31.760> class<00:02:32.150> seems<00:02:32.360> to<00:02:32.510> work<00:02:32.690> well<00:02:32.720> for

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
this this class seems to work well for

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.170 
this this class seems to work well for
this<00:02:33.800> map<00:02:34.040> especially<00:02:34.730> because<00:02:34.820> you<00:02:34.970> can

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
this map especially because you can

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.780 
this map especially because you can
hipfire<00:02:35.630> the<00:02:35.870> mp5<00:02:36.350> with<00:02:37.100> steady<00:02:37.370> aim<00:02:37.550> because

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
hipfire the mp5 with steady aim because

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.190 
hipfire the mp5 with steady aim because
the<00:02:38.240> the<00:02:38.570> reticule<00:02:38.990> it's<00:02:39.740> not<00:02:39.980> too<00:02:40.340> wide<00:02:40.640> open

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
the the reticule it's not too wide open

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.100 
the the reticule it's not too wide open
so<00:02:42.200> I<00:02:42.230> find<00:02:42.709> myself<00:02:43.630> especially<00:02:44.630> maps<00:02:44.989> like

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
so I find myself especially maps like

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.880 
so I find myself especially maps like
vacant<00:02:45.560> as<00:02:45.680> well<00:02:45.860> I<00:02:45.890> find<00:02:46.160> myself<00:02:46.780> like<00:02:47.890> hip

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
vacant as well I find myself like hip

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.720 
vacant as well I find myself like hip
fire<00:02:49.130> in<00:02:49.340> them<00:02:49.520> from<00:02:50.270> a<00:02:50.360> long<00:02:50.510> ways<00:02:50.690> away<00:02:50.720> but

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
fire in them from a long ways away but

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.729 
fire in them from a long ways away but
the<00:02:52.730> most<00:02:53.450> in<00:02:53.570> this<00:02:53.630> video<00:02:53.930> is<00:02:54.170> coming<00:02:54.590> from<00:02:54.650> my

the most in this video is coming from my

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.060 
the most in this video is coming from my
killstreaks<00:02:55.070> which<00:02:55.550> are<00:02:55.760> 5<00:02:56.090> 7<00:02:56.420> 11<00:02:56.510> I<00:02:57.070> usually

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.460 
killstreaks which are 5 7 11 I usually
run<00:02:58.459> with<00:02:58.730> nuke<00:02:59.000> as<00:02:59.269> most<00:02:59.600> of<00:02:59.810> you<00:03:00.019> know<00:03:00.110> this

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470

video is from my from my chopper gunner
I'd<00:03:26.480> like<00:03:26.690> to<00:03:26.840> I<00:03:26.989> like<00:03:27.049> to<00:03:27.290> spawn<00:03:27.530> trap<00:03:27.739> them<00:03:27.920> in

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
I'd like to I like to spawn trap them in

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.110 
I'd like to I like to spawn trap them in
their<00:03:28.220> spawn<00:03:28.430> when<00:03:28.610> I'm<00:03:28.730> in<00:03:28.850> the<00:03:28.940> chopper

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
their spawn when I'm in the chopper

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.199 
their spawn when I'm in the chopper
gunner<00:03:29.829> would<00:03:30.829> you<00:03:30.980> prefer<00:03:31.130> a<00:03:31.280> c-130<00:03:32.060> your

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
gunner would you prefer a c-130 your

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.960 
gunner would you prefer a c-130 your
chopper<00:03:32.480> gunner<00:03:33.130> it<00:03:34.130> really<00:03:34.370> just<00:03:34.519> depends<00:03:34.850> on

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
chopper gunner it really just depends on

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.910 
chopper gunner it really just depends on
the<00:03:35.060> map<00:03:35.239> a<00:03:35.480> map<00:03:35.600> like<00:03:35.930> this<00:03:35.989> I<00:03:36.440> would<00:03:36.799> rather

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
the map a map like this I would rather

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.310 
the map a map like this I would rather
use<00:03:37.190> the<00:03:37.459> chopper<00:03:38.269> gunner<00:03:38.420> if<00:03:38.510> it's<00:03:38.750> just<00:03:39.140> so

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 
use the chopper gunner if it's just so

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.680 
use the chopper gunner if it's just so
easy<00:03:39.350> to<00:03:39.739> spawn<00:03:40.160> trap<00:03:40.400> with<00:03:40.549> that<00:03:40.700> map<00:03:41.390> site

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
easy to spawn trap with that map site

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.690 
easy to spawn trap with that map site
like<00:03:42.200> it's<00:03:42.410> a<00:03:42.500> bigger<00:03:42.920> maps<00:03:43.190> where<00:03:43.430> you<00:03:43.519> can't

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
like it's a bigger maps where you can't

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.850 
like it's a bigger maps where you can't
really<00:03:43.790> sponsor<00:03:44.209> them<00:03:44.360> as<00:03:44.480> easy<00:03:44.630> Alexei's<00:03:45.470> 81

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
really sponsor them as easy Alexei's 81

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:51.130 
really sponsor them as easy Alexei's 81
x<00:03:45.980> ray<00:03:46.480> can't<00:03:47.480> really<00:03:47.660> run<00:03:47.780> away<00:03:48.370> okay<00:03:49.930> but<00:03:50.930> yet

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
x ray can't really run away okay but yet

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.600 
x ray can't really run away okay but yet
for<00:03:51.470> some<00:03:51.590> reason<00:03:51.650> that<00:03:52.070> i<00:03:52.190> don't<00:03:52.370> know<00:03:52.430> why

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
for some reason that i don't know why

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:54.340 
for some reason that i don't know why
but<00:03:52.640> my<00:03:53.030> chopper<00:03:53.510> gunner<00:03:53.660> seems<00:03:53.930> to<00:03:54.049> stay<00:03:54.230> up

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
but my chopper gunner seems to stay up

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.870 
but my chopper gunner seems to stay up
longer<00:03:54.739> than<00:03:54.769> usual<00:03:55.420> but<00:03:56.420> um<00:03:57.280> yeah<00:03:58.280> like<00:03:58.730> in

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
longer than usual but um yeah like in

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.020 
longer than usual but um yeah like in
this<00:03:59.000> map<00:03:59.239> anyway<00:03:59.570> but<00:04:00.200> as<00:04:00.410> you<00:04:01.190> saw<00:04:01.489> i'm<00:04:01.700> using

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
this map anyway but as you saw i'm using
