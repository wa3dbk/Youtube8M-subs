said<00:01:26.130> mid-range<00:01:26.700> weapon<00:01:27.229> usually<00:01:28.229> we<00:01:29.189> would

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
said mid-range weapon usually we would

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.390 
said mid-range weapon usually we would
try<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:29.939> do<00:01:30.119> this<00:01:30.299> at<00:01:30.509> 300<00:01:30.990> meters<00:01:31.079> today<00:01:32.040> the

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
try to do this at 300 meters today the

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.340 
try to do this at 300 meters today the
wind<00:01:32.640> is<00:01:32.850> above<00:01:33.180> 20<00:01:33.570> miles<00:01:33.750> per<00:01:33.930> hour

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
wind is above 20 miles per hour

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.890 
wind is above 20 miles per hour
so<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.369> be<00:01:35.490> fair<00:01:35.520> we're<00:01:36.060> going<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.479> shoot<00:01:36.630> just

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
about two inches the two and a half I'd

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.420 
about two inches the two and a half I'd
say<00:03:42.970> two<00:03:43.030> and<00:03:43.300> a<00:03:43.330> half<00:03:43.480> inch<00:03:43.750> of<00:03:44.280> grouping<00:03:45.280> on

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
say two and a half inch of grouping on

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.690 
say two and a half inch of grouping on
here<00:03:45.700> alright<00:03:46.000> so<00:03:46.240> for<00:03:46.870> this<00:03:47.860> little<00:03:48.100> contest

here<00:03:48.970> the<00:03:49.210> SOCOM<00:03:49.630> beats<00:03:49.960> out<00:03:50.170> the<00:03:50.380> ar-10

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:50.740 
here the SOCOM beats out the ar-10

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.740 
here the SOCOM beats out the ar-10
alright<00:03:51.670> so<00:03:51.940> we<00:03:52.030> just<00:03:52.210> got<00:03:52.390> done<00:03:52.420> shooting

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
both of them they are 10 and the SOCOM

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.590 
both of them they are 10 and the SOCOM
and<00:03:55.959> out<00:03:56.590> of<00:03:56.740> the<00:03:56.890> two<00:03:57.100> it<00:03:58.030> seemed<00:03:58.330> like<00:03:58.450> the

and out of the two it seemed like the

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.480 
and out of the two it seemed like the
SOCOM<00:03:58.990> held<00:03:59.260> a<00:03:59.380> little<00:03:59.560> bit<00:03:59.770> better<00:03:59.950> grouping

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:00.490 
SOCOM held a little bit better grouping

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.910 
SOCOM held a little bit better grouping
which<00:04:01.390> was<00:04:01.630> a<00:04:01.660> surprise<00:04:01.930> actually<00:04:02.680> to<00:04:02.830> make
