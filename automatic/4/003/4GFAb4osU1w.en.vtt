00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:09.109
 hi guys and evolutionary this third tutorial 

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:12.979
 today I show ùù of course a new play and thanks for the 

00:00:12.979 --> 00:00:15.879
 views then we leave 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:19.409
 and please tell me stop when you want boh 

00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:22.159
 here is ok perfect ok 

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:25.220
 keep this card well 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.439
 I don't see her ruining the camera 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.100
 lapland mo over the boulder and have the boulder cut in this case 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.100
 of course I do it 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.520
 perfect 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.460
 believe it or not 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.070
 with a simple gesture of the hands 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.930
 the card of your choice is already in the deck 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.020
 foot 5 pic 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.980
 However 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.570
 it's not 5 of spades 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.250
 but we could try to see a clue 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.520
 we count 5 cards after the 5 of spades 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.590
 2 years 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:06.620
 4 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.620
 what a card it was 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.270
 ok 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.200
 how this game works 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.490
 let's say that compared to the other games you've seen this here 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.479
 has a greater impact it is a little more professional even if very easy 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.030
 follow I recommend the presentation 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.950
 basically we have to prepare the deck at the beginning as it works 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.580
 we must take 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.409
 a 5 a 4 on average a low card let's say we're down if 4 5 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:42.980
 as a number 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.370
 and we put it 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.580
 on the contrary right of back 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.520
 example this intel i5 and we put it as the fifth card 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.160
 on the contrary in March 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.010
 remains as the fifth card now we do nothing but 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:04.620
 let the viewer choose any card in this case we have 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:05.930
 afraid of flowers 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.899
 we tell the viewer to put the card on and let's have it done 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.899
 spectator let's cut the deck where it wants 

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:16.899
 of course we make our magic gesture 

00:02:18.029 --> 00:02:19.169
 let's say 

00:02:19.169 --> 00:02:20.799
 that paper 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:24.420
 the spectator was already filmed in the deck and of the 5 of spades 

00:02:24.419 --> 00:02:27.479
 pira is not so but we know that 

00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:32.699
 the 5 card of spades is only the indication that will go to take us to the 

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:37.709
 exact card in fact if he loves me to count the fifth card after 5 of pic in this 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.730
 if you look at the deck to your left in the camera it will be 

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:43.089
 the right 

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:46.369
 I have to mount a 2 34 

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:49.499
 hi5 incredibly will come out ours 

00:02:49.499 --> 00:02:53.749
 3 of flowers this because I show you the principle so we understand one 

00:02:53.749 --> 00:02:54.749
 time for all 

00:02:54.749 --> 00:02:57.819
 then we keep our card turned off 

00:02:58.619 --> 00:03:03.079
 in the fifth position the 6 and 5 attention if you put six must be sixth 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:04.969
 position 6 4 in fourth 

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:07.149
 the wrong thing 

00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:10.809
 the paper that the viewer chooses for us is indifferent I recommend 

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:13.809
 the important fabric does not show how I did now 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:16.059
 spreading the marzocco 

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:20.639
 when there is a card, the spectator chooses the card to be put back together on March e 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:22.459
 get it put on 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:27.769
 because in this way by cutting the deck naturally the four cards the l 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.659
 of the 4 cards we put on that turn will go 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:35.179
 exactly it in the fifth position 

00:03:35.179 --> 00:03:38.569
 in this case, of course, 1 2 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:41.009
 4 the fifth card is 

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:42.549
 our ace 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:45.559
 now in this case 

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:47.549
 I hope you like that this tutorial 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:48.790
