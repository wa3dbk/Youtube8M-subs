crops and have had very very good
success<00:00:18.449> so<00:00:19.400> what<00:00:20.400> attracted<00:00:20.490> us<00:00:20.880> to<00:00:20.939> try<00:00:21.210> and

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
success so what attracted us to try and

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.609 
success so what attracted us to try and
butternut<00:00:21.599> squash<00:00:21.869> is<00:00:22.109> because<00:00:22.380> it<00:00:22.470> has<00:00:22.589> a

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
long storage life which is super

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.099 
long storage life which is super
attractive<00:00:26.039> for<00:00:26.519> those<00:00:26.669> trying<00:00:26.999> to<00:00:27.300> grow

and then similar to pumpkin or summer
squash<00:01:05.810> the<00:01:06.810> seeds<00:01:07.109> get<00:01:07.560> planted<00:01:07.619> around<00:01:07.979> 1/2

00:01:08.209 --> 00:01:08.219 
squash the seeds get planted around 1/2

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:11.630 
squash the seeds get planted around 1/2
inch<00:01:08.460> deep<00:01:08.670> 1/2<00:01:09.299> inch<00:01:09.539> to<00:01:09.659> an<00:01:09.749> inch<00:01:09.899> deep<00:01:10.640> we

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
inch deep 1/2 inch to an inch deep we

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.020 
inch deep 1/2 inch to an inch deep we
like<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:11.939> plant<00:01:12.289> a<00:01:13.289> few<00:01:14.130> seeds<00:01:14.189> in<00:01:14.579> each<00:01:14.670> mound

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
like to plant a few seeds in each mound

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.959 
like to plant a few seeds in each mound
so<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.109> we<00:01:16.229> ensure<00:01:16.380> we<00:01:16.590> get<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:17.159> nice<00:01:17.490> plant

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:17.969 
so that we ensure we get a nice plant

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:23.660 
so that we ensure we get a nice plant
that<00:01:18.119> comes<00:01:18.270> up

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.730 

okay<00:01:24.450> so<00:01:24.510> we<00:01:24.690> finished<00:01:24.840> planting<00:01:25.260> the

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
okay so we finished planting the

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.830 
okay so we finished planting the
butternut<00:01:26.100> squash<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:27.560> we<00:01:28.560> ended<00:01:28.710> up<00:01:28.830> spacing

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
butternut squash and we ended up spacing

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.130 
butternut squash and we ended up spacing
each<00:01:30.840> set<00:01:31.470> of<00:01:31.500> seeds<00:01:32.540> around<00:01:33.540> three<00:01:34.110> feet

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
each set of seeds around three feet

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.380 
each set of seeds around three feet
apart<00:01:34.530> which<00:01:35.400> is<00:01:35.430> similar<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:35.880> what<00:01:36.030> regular

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
apart which is similar to what regular

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.420 
apart which is similar to what regular
squash<00:01:36.659> would<00:01:36.840> take<00:01:37.050> and<00:01:37.290> what<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.130> package

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
squash would take and what the package

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.850 
squash would take and what the package
says<00:01:38.580> we<00:01:38.670> should<00:01:38.820> do<00:01:38.940> we<00:01:39.660> did<00:01:39.900> leave<00:01:40.110> four<00:01:40.560> feet

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
says we should do we did leave four feet

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.859 
says we should do we did leave four feet
in<00:01:41.009> between<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.790> next<00:01:41.940> row<00:01:42.180> which<00:01:42.360> is<00:01:42.390> peppers

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
in between the next row which is peppers

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.730 
in between the next row which is peppers
and<00:01:43.140> butternut<00:01:43.860> squash<00:01:44.810> just<00:01:45.810> so<00:01:45.960> that<00:01:46.110> we<00:01:46.290> got

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
and butternut squash just so that we got

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.730 
and butternut squash just so that we got
enough<00:01:46.920> room<00:01:47.159> for<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:48.150> plant<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.570> also<00:01:49.020> so<00:01:49.619> we

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
enough room for the plant and also so we

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.969 
enough room for the plant and also so we
can<00:01:49.770> walk<00:01:50.009> through<00:01:50.450> for<00:01:51.450> harvesting<00:01:51.979> and

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
can walk through for harvesting and

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.729 
can walk through for harvesting and
we'll<00:01:53.100> see<00:01:53.310> how<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:53.550> goes
