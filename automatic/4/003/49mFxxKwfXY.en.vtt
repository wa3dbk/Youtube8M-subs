00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:28.930
 if he has a screenshot on facebook 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:31.930
 so that the Internet began to cram 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.930
 the Internet 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:44.560
 broken internet but there is a bumper 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:46.710
 ask the page so we have with 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.710
 by internet 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:52.880
 so let's see it happen 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.190
 write and single duplicate nothing 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:58.940
 cut no internet eat mean it 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:00.830
 facebook just fell let's go again 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.560
 try it not facebook it a no 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:05.350
 facebook all right well let's 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:10.750
 wait because it will hurt if 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:10.750
 because of the internet we will break the winner 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:22.200
 twitter on the water again open 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:24.710
 Vladislav Tarasov tweeted all over the 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.710
 fine 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.500
 so but I have only one thought 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.330
 try go 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.000
 Internet time does not open to give 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.650
 property detail reconnect to 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:43.460
 don't drink or hertz 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:46.260
 normal grid and now we do refresh 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:48.690
 No, apparently , but now something 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:50.730
 probably come oh how facebook then 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.690
 the last time its sound is 

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:56.730
 often happens 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:58.470
 it works like hell in my he 

00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:01.110
 wants to say yes these materials 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:03.900
 unavailable link expired 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:05.970
 so unfortunately we check not 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:09.990
 we can't all I can do this 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:13.440
 look again on twitter and if there 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:16.380
 there is a screenshot then Vladislav Taras will 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:18.840
 win and here are the screenshot 

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:21.000
 the way he has 9 stands because 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:23.010
 these are the signs question is a canopy 9 something like this 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.020
 that all vladislav tarasov and twitter 

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:27.540
 absolutely right to do everything up to 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:32.669
 The 16th is long ago therefore it is with us and 

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:34.650
 there are 5 winner winner number 5 here 

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:38.100
 so this way we selected everyone 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:39.600
 five participants more precisely the winners of those 

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:41.250
 who didn't win this time but not 

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.870
 be upset with us as usual 

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:44.130
 there will be many contests the only thing that we 

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:45.690
 By the way you can see whether the latest on 

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:48.620
 re-checked let's still it 

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:50.870
 let's make 1 of 1 

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:53.310
 now everything is fair and just 

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:57.320
 hear and see you in others 

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:57.320
