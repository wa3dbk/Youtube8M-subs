okay<00:03:52.060> over<00:03:53.060> the<00:03:53.180> lifetimes<00:03:53.600> of<00:03:53.780> the<00:03:53.900> systems

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
okay over the lifetimes of the systems

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.410 
okay over the lifetimes of the systems
what<00:03:54.709> do<00:03:54.770> you<00:03:54.830> guys<00:03:54.920> ad<00:03:55.160> 'it's<00:03:55.310> graphics<00:03:56.180> on

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
what do you guys ad 'it's graphics on

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.720 
what do you guys ad 'it's graphics on
the<00:03:56.780> system's<00:03:57.290> yeah<00:03:57.739> get<00:03:57.980> better<00:03:58.250> as<00:03:58.580> the

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
the system's yeah get better as the

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.400 
the system's yeah get better as the
developers<00:03:59.209> get<00:03:59.360> better<00:03:59.600> yeah<00:03:59.900> so<00:04:00.230> why

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
developers get better yeah so why

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.020 
developers get better yeah so why
wouldn't<00:04:00.650> you<00:04:00.769> debate<00:04:01.160> which<00:04:01.459> one's<00:04:01.700> getting

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
wouldn't you debate which one's getting

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.280 
wouldn't you debate which one's getting
better<00:04:02.300> which<00:04:02.570> one<00:04:02.780> are<00:04:02.900> they<00:04:02.989> developing

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
better which one are they developing

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.090 
better which one are they developing
better<00:04:03.769> for<00:04:04.310> I<00:04:04.970> think<00:04:05.660> for<00:04:05.930> a<00:04:05.959> ps3<00:04:06.230> exclusives

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
better for I think for a ps3 exclusives

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.640 
better for I think for a ps3 exclusives
I<00:04:07.250> know<00:04:07.489> it's<00:04:07.610> dumb<00:04:07.850> so<00:04:08.540> dumb<00:04:08.570> don't<00:04:09.290> do<00:04:09.500> this

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
I know it's dumb so dumb don't do this

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:10.800 
I know it's dumb so dumb don't do this
all<00:04:09.950> right

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
all right

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:13.559 
all right
the<00:04:11.530> ps3<00:04:11.950> obviously<00:04:12.489> is<00:04:12.610> more<00:04:12.819> powerful<00:04:13.000> but

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:13.569 
the ps3 obviously is more powerful but

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:15.750 
the ps3 obviously is more powerful but
it<00:04:14.020> seems<00:04:14.260> like<00:04:14.319> the<00:04:14.770> developers<00:04:15.370> are<00:04:15.580> not

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
it seems like the developers are not

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.060 
it seems like the developers are not
putting<00:04:16.000> the<00:04:16.180> time<00:04:16.419> into<00:04:16.840> the<00:04:16.930> ps3<00:04:17.470> latex<00:04:17.859> yeah

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
putting the time into the ps3 latex yeah

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.729 
putting the time into the ps3 latex yeah
exclusives<00:04:18.970> but<00:04:19.299> if<00:04:19.480> you<00:04:19.600> put<00:04:19.870> up<00:04:20.019> a<00:04:20.200> game<00:04:20.440> like

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
exclusives but if you put up a game like

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.620 
exclusives but if you put up a game like
a<00:04:20.799> lot<00:04:21.100> of<00:04:21.280> games<00:04:21.519> that<00:04:21.669> come<00:04:21.940> out<00:04:22.120> now<00:04:22.300> it<00:04:22.480> is

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
a lot of games that come out now it is

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.350 
a lot of games that come out now it is
like<00:04:23.020> crysis<00:04:23.440> 3<00:04:23.740> will<00:04:24.130> look<00:04:24.310> probably<00:04:25.180> better

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
like crysis 3 will look probably better

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.510 
like crysis 3 will look probably better
on<00:04:25.630> the<00:04:25.720> 360<00:04:26.200> that<00:04:26.500> doesn't<00:04:26.800> look<00:04:26.860> yes<00:04:27.130> why<00:04:27.460> is

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
on the 360 that doesn't look yes why is

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.790 
on the 360 that doesn't look yes why is
that<00:04:27.760> because<00:04:28.360> it's<00:04:28.810> harder<00:04:29.110> like<00:04:29.260> we<00:04:29.500> said<00:04:29.680> it

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
that because it's harder like we said it

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.100 
that because it's harder like we said it
before<00:04:29.889> it's<00:04:30.250> harder<00:04:30.610> to<00:04:30.639> develop<00:04:31.600> a<00:04:31.660> game<00:04:31.840> for

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
before it's harder to develop a game for

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.200 
before it's harder to develop a game for
PS<00:04:32.380> but<00:04:32.650> if<00:04:32.800> the<00:04:32.980> graphics<00:04:33.460> so<00:04:33.700> important<00:04:34.150> to

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
PS but if the graphics so important to

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:35.670 
PS but if the graphics so important to
people<00:04:34.360> out<00:04:34.600> there<00:04:34.900> why<00:04:35.440> aren't<00:04:35.620> the

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
people out there why aren't the

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.170 
people out there why aren't the
developers<00:04:36.190> putting<00:04:36.460> the<00:04:36.520> timing<00:04:36.880> and<00:04:36.940> going

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
developers putting the timing and going

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.390 
developers putting the timing and going
look<00:04:37.389> it<00:04:37.690> really<00:04:37.960> is<00:04:38.139> better<00:04:38.350> on<00:04:38.560> ps3<00:04:38.889> that's

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
look it really is better on ps3 that's

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.790 
look it really is better on ps3 that's
more<00:04:39.610> work<00:04:39.790> you<00:04:40.510> know<00:04:40.600> what<00:04:40.720> job<00:04:41.470> wreck<00:04:41.650> and

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
more work you know what job wreck and

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:42.990 
more work you know what job wreck and
they<00:04:41.860> have<00:04:41.889> a<00:04:42.040> captive<00:04:42.280> audience<00:04:42.490> a<00:04:42.820> latte

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
they have a captive audience a latte

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.969 
they have a captive audience a latte
we'll<00:04:43.210> just<00:04:43.479> have<00:04:43.660> one<00:04:43.990> sis<00:04:44.200> or<00:04:44.380> my<00:04:44.500> own<00:04:44.620> people

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:44.979 
we'll just have one sis or my own people

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:46.680 
we'll just have one sis or my own people
don't<00:04:45.130> have<00:04:45.250> an<00:04:45.370> xbox<00:04:45.580> or<00:04:45.940> playstation<00:04:46.090> there

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
don't have an xbox or playstation there

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:48.480 
don't have an xbox or playstation there
a<00:04:46.720> fanboy<00:04:47.139> for<00:04:47.350> one<00:04:47.470> of<00:04:47.590> the<00:04:47.680> other<00:04:47.830> so<00:04:48.220> I<00:04:48.400> think

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
a fanboy for one of the other so I think

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.460 
a fanboy for one of the other so I think
that<00:04:48.610> proves<00:04:49.120> that<00:04:49.270> the<00:04:49.570> next<00:04:49.870> generation<00:04:50.410> of

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
that proves that the next generation of

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.670 
that proves that the next generation of
xbox<00:04:50.979> and<00:04:51.250> ps3<00:04:51.820> they<00:04:52.630> don't<00:04:52.930> they're<00:04:53.650> not

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
xbox and ps3 they don't they're not

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.500 
xbox and ps3 they don't they're not
going<00:04:53.889> to<00:04:53.950> rely<00:04:54.220> on<00:04:54.250> the<00:04:54.370> graphics<00:04:54.970> they're<00:04:55.300> so

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:55.510 
going to rely on the graphics they're so

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.690 
going to rely on the graphics they're so
difficult<00:04:56.050> to<00:04:56.200> make<00:04:56.350> them<00:04:56.500> look<00:04:56.530> so<00:04:56.979> amazing

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:57.700 
difficult to make them look so amazing

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.670 
difficult to make them look so amazing
why<00:04:58.300> are<00:04:58.360> they<00:04:58.419> going<00:04:58.600> to<00:04:58.660> spend<00:04:59.110> so<00:04:59.470> much

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
why are they going to spend so much

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.110 
why are they going to spend so much
money<00:04:59.979> on<00:05:00.130> these<00:05:00.370> games<00:05:00.700> that<00:05:00.880> are<00:05:00.970> going<00:05:01.060> to

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
money on these games that are going to

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.850 
money on these games that are going to
take<00:05:01.240> five<00:05:01.540> years<00:05:01.750> to<00:05:01.900> make<00:05:02.139> and<00:05:02.320> the<00:05:02.380> graft<00:05:02.620> is

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
take five years to make and the graft is

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.370 
take five years to make and the graft is
