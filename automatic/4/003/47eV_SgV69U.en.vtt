00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.230
 Greetings from the minuszone we 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:19.240
 make today's move there once 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.960
 we following things yes sometimes 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:25.320
 precooked why an onion higher 19 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.240
 jimmy nutmeg salt pepper 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.230
 beef broth cream and butter at the beginning 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.130
 Buying was not that much 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.349
 prepare 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.349
 we just have to peel our onion 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.920
 if we did that 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:55.510
 the analog dice because we cook 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.309
 Now again with the chestnuts right 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:01.300
 nice with it at that later 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:03.809
 can perform this I looked 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:12.720
 Melt the subject pot 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:12.720
 Here we go to sweat 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:27.100
 the very short time but also live 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.100
 to 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:40.390
 that is part of our job 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.000
 and now let why nice and soft 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.840
 Cook what you give for brÃ¼hl 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.910
 not really matter 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.720
 i have taken winter earlier now 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:55.729
 But you can also poultry broth or 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:58.240
 Depending on how you take the vegetables 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.240
 likes best 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.399
 lid on it 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:13.010
 in the meantime I have already 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.980
 sometimes more like the seemingly very fine 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:24.080
 roll the dice 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:26.200
 first in pagan then in fine 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.200
 streak 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.380
 and then at the end in fine 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.380
 cube 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:57.540
 now it's the same of it 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:03:04.820
 we need the same amount of from about 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:04.820
 100 grams then schema the 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:30.060
 and then he will be first time 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:48.980
 cut his stripes and then 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:51.510
 Again, after 15 to 20 minutes 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.310
 cooked softly you notice that 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.329
 because finland orders that one 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:04:01.189
 which can easily break 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:01.189
 now we will puree it all 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:11.160
 if all this then a nice three 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:15.240
 is stamped we want the 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:19.230
 remaining broth and then it comes 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:20.310
 Let's leave it on the stove here 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.820
 the whole thing nice again 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.820
 bring to the boil 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:29.210
 let's go over the carrots dice 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:54.420
 and the salary of the movie then we would 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:56.960
 that still very little pepper and 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:56.960
 nutmeg 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:10.140
 so happy cook up to that too 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.590
 already widely but still slightly in 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.590
 Wiesbaden 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:19.080
 And now finally comes the 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.210
 cream now we can do that 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.550
 somehow then still leave a simmer 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.630
 until it has the desired consistency or 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.250
 if it's a bit faster 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.650
 should just with a bit 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:35.700
 depicts more and then concludes 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:36.840
 as I said, cream it so now 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.130
 we have to make that pretty well too 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.730
 and then it says 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.730
 Enjoy your meal 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.960
