Devon<00:00:01.020> it's<00:00:01.879> update<00:00:02.879> on<00:00:03.030> this<00:00:03.179> del<00:00:03.750> Sol<00:00:04.020> here

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:04.289 
Devon it's update on this del Sol here

00:00:04.289 --> 00:00:09.890 
Devon it's update on this del Sol here
now<00:00:05.839> this<00:00:06.839> uh<00:00:08.030> this<00:00:09.030> front-end<00:00:09.330> conversion<00:00:09.809> is

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
now this uh this front-end conversion is

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.430 
now this uh this front-end conversion is
a<00:00:09.959> lot<00:00:10.110> easier<00:00:10.139> than<00:00:10.530> I<00:00:10.559> thought<00:00:10.589> it<00:00:10.830> would<00:00:11.099> be

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:12.440 
a lot easier than I thought it would be

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.160 
a lot easier than I thought it would be
getting<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:13.679> old<00:00:14.870> radiator<00:00:15.870> core<00:00:16.110> support

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
getting the old radiator core support

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.200 
getting the old radiator core support
off<00:00:16.650> because<00:00:16.830> it<00:00:17.070> has<00:00:17.220> tack<00:00:17.550> welds<00:00:17.910> on<00:00:18.029> there's

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
off because it has tack welds on there's

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.580 
off because it has tack welds on there's
a<00:00:18.240> little<00:00:18.330> bit<00:00:18.510> tougher<00:00:18.869> but<00:00:19.019> because<00:00:19.380> this

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
a little bit tougher but because this

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.080 
a little bit tougher but because this
one<00:00:19.769> was<00:00:19.859> already<00:00:20.220> wrecked<00:00:20.460> I<00:00:20.640> just<00:00:20.880> like

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
one was already wrecked I just like

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.689 
one was already wrecked I just like
sliced<00:00:21.599> it<00:00:21.840> and<00:00:21.869> then<00:00:22.109> pulled<00:00:22.380> it<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:23.070> if<00:00:23.550> you

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
sliced it and then pulled it and if you

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.970 
sliced it and then pulled it and if you
pull<00:00:23.970> it<00:00:24.000> you<00:00:24.840> know<00:00:24.990> it'll<00:00:25.349> just<00:00:25.560> basically

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
pull it you know it'll just basically

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.310 
pull it you know it'll just basically
snap<00:00:26.339> off<00:00:26.609> there<00:00:26.880> I've<00:00:27.330> still<00:00:27.720> got<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:27.990> do<00:00:28.140> this

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
snap off there I've still got to do this

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.740 
snap off there I've still got to do this
but<00:00:29.390> this<00:00:30.390> is<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.660> hat<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.500> welded<00:00:31.919> the<00:00:32.750> core

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
but this is a hat and welded the core

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.380 
but this is a hat and welded the core
support<00:00:34.020> in<00:00:34.140> there<00:00:34.320> but<00:00:34.950> it's<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.310> it's<00:00:36.150> damn

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
support in there but it's a it's damn

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.060 
support in there but it's a it's damn
near<00:00:36.600> perfect<00:00:36.810> even<00:00:37.350> with<00:00:37.500> this<00:00:37.680> side<00:00:37.860> being

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
near perfect even with this side being

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.550 
near perfect even with this side being
right<00:00:38.420> now<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.480> whole<00:00:39.780> fender<00:00:40.050> thing<00:00:40.380> and

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.620 
of like a starting point on what to do
this<00:00:52.860> because<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.400> mean<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:54.090> course<00:00:54.150> cutting

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:54.630 
this because I mean of course cutting

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.110 
this because I mean of course cutting
the<00:00:54.780> fenders<00:00:55.140> is<00:00:55.380> the<00:00:56.160> scariest<00:00:56.520> thing<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.970> do

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
the fenders is the scariest thing to do

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.440 
the fenders is the scariest thing to do
on<00:00:57.270> this<00:00:57.710> whole<00:00:58.710> conversion<00:00:59.280> because<00:01:00.030> nobody

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:00.450 
on this whole conversion because nobody

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.030 
on this whole conversion because nobody
gives<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.810> point<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.200> reference<00:01:01.260> on<00:01:01.800> where

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.040 
gives you a point of reference on where

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.849 
gives you a point of reference on where
to<00:01:02.130> cut<00:01:02.310> the<00:01:02.430> damn<00:01:02.580> thing<00:01:02.880> from<00:01:03.080> but<00:01:04.080> what<00:01:04.769> I've

you're doing this conversion on the
front<00:01:16.530> end<00:01:16.649> your<00:01:17.130> point<00:01:17.460> of<00:01:17.549> reference<00:01:17.609> is

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
front end your point of reference is

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.539 
front end your point of reference is
always<00:01:18.509> gonna<00:01:18.689> be<00:01:18.780> your<00:01:21.109> your<00:01:22.109> screw<00:01:22.469> holes

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
right here you got three of them in the

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.410 
right here you got three of them in the
fender<00:01:25.939> and<00:01:28.670> that's<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.850> thing<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.270> the

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
fender and that's the thing that the

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.770 
fender and that's the thing that the
only<00:01:30.569> difference<00:01:30.840> between<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.530> del<00:01:31.710> Sol

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
only difference between the del Sol

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.649 
only difference between the del Sol
offenders<00:01:33.780> when<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.140> comes<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:35.359> length<00:01:36.359> and

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
offenders when it comes to length and

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.380 
offenders when it comes to length and
not<00:01:36.749> fitting<00:01:37.259> is<00:01:37.530> if<00:01:37.829> you<00:01:38.249> can<00:01:38.429> actually<00:01:38.729> mount

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
not fitting is if you can actually mount

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.679 
not fitting is if you can actually mount
an<00:01:39.689> eg<00:01:40.350> fender<00:01:40.679> onto<00:01:41.069> this<00:01:41.219> but<00:01:41.939> over<00:01:42.450> here

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
an eg fender onto this but over here

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.389 
an eg fender onto this but over here
it's<00:01:43.289> gonna<00:01:43.439> be<00:01:43.649> about<00:01:43.740> an<00:01:43.920> inch<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.219> a<00:01:44.249> half

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
it's gonna be about an inch and a half

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.660 
it's gonna be about an inch and a half
short<00:01:45.469> but<00:01:46.469> all<00:01:46.619> your<00:01:46.799> Mountain<00:01:47.159> points<00:01:47.549> are

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
short but all your Mountain points are

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.660 
short but all your Mountain points are
exactly<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:48.240> same<00:01:48.509> so<00:01:48.810> let's<00:01:49.710> say<00:01:49.889> that<00:01:50.159> that

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
exactly the same so let's say that that

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.039 
exactly the same so let's say that that
fender<00:01:51.119> over<00:01:51.270> there<00:01:51.420> was<00:01:51.539> a<00:01:51.569> little<00:01:51.780> bit<00:01:51.869> more

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
fender over there was a little bit more

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.190 
fender over there was a little bit more
difficult<00:01:52.469> because<00:01:52.999> it<00:01:53.999> was<00:01:54.060> uh<00:01:54.299> it<00:01:55.139> was

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
difficult because it was uh it was

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.719 
difficult because it was uh it was
wrecked<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:55.770> all<00:01:55.950> that<00:01:56.159> but<00:01:56.310> this<00:01:56.429> fender

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
wrecked and all that but this fender

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.139 
wrecked and all that but this fender
over<00:01:56.909> here<00:01:57.090> would<00:01:57.179> be<00:01:57.209> a<00:01:57.299> lot<00:01:57.539> more<00:01:57.689> easier<00:01:57.950> so

00:01:59.139 --> 00:01:59.149 
over here would be a lot more easier so

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:02.539 
over here would be a lot more easier so
what<00:02:00.149> you<00:02:00.329> would<00:02:00.450> do<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.350> could<00:02:02.069> do<00:02:02.189> it<00:02:02.340> I

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
what you would do and you could do it I

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.940 
what you would do and you could do it I
would<00:02:03.149> figure<00:02:03.539> anywhere<00:02:04.079> on<00:02:04.319> the<00:02:04.499> fender<00:02:04.799> but

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
would figure anywhere on the fender but

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.330 
would figure anywhere on the fender but
the<00:02:05.340> easiest<00:02:05.579> part<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:05.939> do<00:02:06.179> it<00:02:06.329> is<00:02:06.479> probably

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
the easiest part to do it is probably

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.760 
the easiest part to do it is probably
right<00:02:08.340> here<00:02:08.540> because<00:02:09.540> that's<00:02:10.320> going<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:10.650> be

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
right here because that's going to be

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.530 
right here because that's going to be
the<00:02:11.040> least<00:02:11.280> amount<00:02:11.580> of<00:02:11.730> bondo<00:02:12.120> that<00:02:12.300> you<00:02:12.420> would

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
the least amount of bondo that you would

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.790 
the least amount of bondo that you would
have<00:02:12.720> to<00:02:12.870> you<00:02:13.530> know

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
have to you know

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.300 
have to you know
do<00:02:14.010> it<00:02:14.130> up<00:02:14.280> but<00:02:14.780> you<00:02:15.780> can<00:02:15.960> take<00:02:16.140> it<00:02:16.170> directly<00:02:16.710> in

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
do it up but you can take it directly in

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.970 
do it up but you can take it directly in
the<00:02:17.400> middle<00:02:17.730> of<00:02:17.850> this<00:02:18.030> groove<00:02:18.530> cut<00:02:19.530> it<00:02:19.650> right

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
the middle of this groove cut it right

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.520 
the middle of this groove cut it right
down<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.280> middle

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
down the middle

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.340 
down the middle
take<00:02:22.530> this<00:02:23.220> fender<00:02:23.610> do<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.210> exact<00:02:24.810> same<00:02:25.080> thing

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
take this fender do the exact same thing

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.380 
take this fender do the exact same thing
in<00:02:25.470> the<00:02:25.560> exact<00:02:25.800> same<00:02:26.040> spot<00:02:26.220> cut<00:02:27.060> it<00:02:27.180> right<00:02:27.330> down

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
in the exact same spot cut it right down

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.430 
in the exact same spot cut it right down
the<00:02:27.720> middle<00:02:27.750> and<00:02:29.300> it<00:02:30.300> will<00:02:30.540> bow<00:02:30.720> it<00:02:30.870> up<00:02:30.960> perfect

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
the middle and it will bow it up perfect

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.650 
the middle and it will bow it up perfect
I<00:02:31.530> mean<00:02:31.980> no<00:02:32.340> kind<00:02:32.580> of<00:02:32.640> issues<00:02:32.970> whatsoever<00:02:33.300> and

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
I mean no kind of issues whatsoever and

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.140 
I mean no kind of issues whatsoever and
that's<00:02:33.750> what<00:02:33.960> I<00:02:33.990> did<00:02:34.230> on<00:02:34.260> that<00:02:34.560> one<00:02:34.940> but<00:02:35.940> I<00:02:35.970> had

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
that's what I did on that one but I had

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.500 
that's what I did on that one but I had
to<00:02:36.270> go<00:02:36.420> from<00:02:37.380> here<00:02:37.650> five<00:02:38.550> inches<00:02:38.880> down<00:02:39.120> and

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
to go from here five inches down and

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.270 
to go from here five inches down and
then<00:02:39.660> cut<00:02:39.900> it<00:02:39.990> and<00:02:40.140> I<00:02:40.530> did<00:02:40.710> the<00:02:40.830> exact<00:02:41.130> same

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
then cut it and I did the exact same

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.670 
then cut it and I did the exact same
spot<00:02:41.550> on<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:41.730> other<00:02:41.940> one<00:02:42.120> it<00:02:42.360> came<00:02:42.540> out<00:02:42.810> great

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
spot on the other one it came out great

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.530 
spot on the other one it came out great
so<00:02:44.250> if<00:02:44.400> you're<00:02:44.550> doing<00:02:44.670> this<00:02:44.820> make<00:02:45.120> sure<00:02:45.180> that

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
so if you're doing this make sure that

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.300 
so if you're doing this make sure that
you<00:02:45.810> you<00:02:46.140> want<00:02:46.380> to<00:02:46.440> measure<00:02:46.590> from<00:02:46.920> your<00:02:46.980> boats

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
you you want to measure from your boats

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.390 
you you want to measure from your boats
because<00:02:47.820> this<00:02:48.600> bolt<00:02:48.930> in<00:02:49.140> the<00:02:49.620> del<00:02:49.830> Sol<00:02:50.070> fender

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
because this bolt in the del Sol fender

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.140 
because this bolt in the del Sol fender
is<00:02:50.630> exactly<00:02:51.630> where<00:02:51.810> this<00:02:52.500> bolt<00:02:52.800> in<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.340> eg

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
is exactly where this bolt in the eg

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.180 
is exactly where this bolt in the eg
fender<00:02:54.480> needs<00:02:54.510> to<00:02:54.840> be<00:02:54.960> so<00:02:55.290> as<00:02:55.770> long<00:02:55.860> as<00:02:55.920> you<00:02:56.070> do

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
fender needs to be so as long as you do

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.430 
fender needs to be so as long as you do
that<00:02:56.220> spawn<00:02:56.730> now<00:02:57.450> they<00:02:57.660> come<00:02:57.840> across<00:02:58.080> that<00:02:58.410> a

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
that spawn now they come across that a

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.730 
that spawn now they come across that a
lot<00:02:58.620> of<00:02:58.650> people<00:02:58.950> say<00:02:59.130> that<00:02:59.160> the<00:03:00.530> the<00:03:01.530> hood

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
lot of people say that the the hood

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.620 
lot of people say that the the hood
latches<00:03:01.980> are<00:03:02.340> gonna<00:03:02.490> be<00:03:02.670> different<00:03:02.880> I'm<00:03:03.450> gonna

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
latches are gonna be different I'm gonna

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.360 
latches are gonna be different I'm gonna
figure<00:03:04.080> out<00:03:04.200> a<00:03:04.320> way<00:03:04.410> to<00:03:04.500> make<00:03:04.710> that<00:03:05.190> work

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
figure out a way to make that work

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.840 
figure out a way to make that work
but<00:03:06.860> right<00:03:07.860> now<00:03:08.010> it's<00:03:08.220> coming<00:03:08.430> along<00:03:08.580> pretty

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
but right now it's coming along pretty

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.130 
but right now it's coming along pretty
smooth<00:03:09.150> it<00:03:09.360> took<00:03:09.540> me<00:03:09.660> about<00:03:12.080> probably<00:03:13.080> about

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
smooth it took me about probably about

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.590 
smooth it took me about probably about
two<00:03:13.470> hours<00:03:13.740> to<00:03:14.040> do<00:03:14.190> this<00:03:14.370> fender<00:03:14.700> to<00:03:15.300> get<00:03:15.450> it

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
two hours to do this fender to get it

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.390 
two hours to do this fender to get it
you<00:03:15.870> know<00:03:16.020> cut<00:03:16.350> in<00:03:16.470> the<00:03:16.530> right<00:03:16.710> place<00:03:17.010> and<00:03:17.220> weld

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
you know cut in the right place and weld

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.130 
you know cut in the right place and weld
it<00:03:17.520> back<00:03:17.550> up<00:03:17.880> I<00:03:18.090> think<00:03:18.420> is<00:03:18.690> gonna<00:03:18.810> come<00:03:19.020> out

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
it back up I think is gonna come out

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.460 
it back up I think is gonna come out
pretty<00:03:19.170> nice<00:03:19.560> I<00:03:19.980> actually<00:03:20.610> might<00:03:21.150> even<00:03:21.470> go

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
pretty nice I actually might even go

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.800 
pretty nice I actually might even go
ahead<00:03:22.709> and<00:03:22.830> paint<00:03:23.120> the<00:03:24.120> front<00:03:24.360> end<00:03:24.510> besides

ahead and paint the front end besides

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.030 
ahead and paint the front end besides
the<00:03:24.930> hood<00:03:25.080> I'm<00:03:25.260> not<00:03:25.410> gonna<00:03:25.560> paint<00:03:25.709> the<00:03:25.830> hood

I<00:03:46.550> don't<00:03:47.550> know<00:03:47.730> 2500<00:03:48.570> bucks<00:03:48.860> because<00:03:49.860> it<00:03:50.160> does

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
I don't know 2500 bucks because it does

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.480 
I don't know 2500 bucks because it does
run<00:03:50.610> good<00:03:51.330> I<00:03:51.360> mean<00:03:51.690> it<00:03:52.470> sets<00:03:52.770> up<00:03:52.950> a<00:03:53.040> little<00:03:53.220> hob

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:53.490 
run good I mean it sets up a little hob

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:55.790 
run good I mean it sets up a little hob
but<00:03:53.730> once<00:03:53.940> I<00:03:54.060> get<00:03:54.240> all<00:03:54.390> this<00:03:54.540> stuff<00:03:54.810> settled<00:03:55.530> in

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
but once I get all this stuff settled in

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.710 
but once I get all this stuff settled in
I<00:03:56.010> just<00:03:56.130> figured<00:03:56.550> out<00:03:56.640> that<00:03:56.700> it<00:03:56.940> has<00:03:57.090> cool<00:03:57.420> over

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
I just figured out that it has cool over

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.630 
I just figured out that it has cool over
so<00:03:57.900> I'm<00:03:57.959> gonna<00:03:58.050> lower<00:03:58.290> it<00:03:58.530> probably<00:03:59.400> about<00:03:59.459> an

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
so I'm gonna lower it probably about an

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.900 
so I'm gonna lower it probably about an
inch<00:03:59.760> to<00:04:00.209> make<00:04:00.390> it<00:04:00.510> set<00:04:00.750> a<00:04:00.780> lot<00:04:00.959> better

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
inch to make it set a lot better

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.840 
inch to make it set a lot better
