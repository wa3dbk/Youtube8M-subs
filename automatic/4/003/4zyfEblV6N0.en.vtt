00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
that's taking drugs and i would notice

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.380 
that's taking drugs and i would notice
because<00:01:37.740> I've<00:01:37.920> been<00:01:37.950> there<00:01:38.130> I'm<00:01:39.060> not<00:01:39.210> saying

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
because I've been there I'm not saying

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.670 
because I've been there I'm not saying
that<00:01:39.509> clean<00:01:39.720> up<00:01:39.840> his<00:01:39.960> comment<00:01:40.320> because<00:01:40.439> they

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
that clean up his comment because they

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.859 
that clean up his comment because they
can<00:01:41.030> athletes<00:01:42.030> have<00:01:42.150> done<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.360> in<00:01:42.420> Beijing<00:01:42.750> and

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
can athletes have done it in Beijing and

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.480 
can athletes have done it in Beijing and
I've<00:01:42.930> done<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.049> before<00:01:43.140> that<00:01:43.590> are<00:01:43.740> proving<00:01:44.369> it

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
I've done it before that are proving it

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.359 
I've done it before that are proving it
this<00:01:44.640> year<00:01:44.820> and<00:01:45.329> last<00:01:45.360> year<00:01:45.890> but<00:01:46.890> yes<00:01:47.130> it's

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
this year and last year but yes it's

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.789 
this year and last year but yes it's
very<00:01:47.430> difficult<00:01:47.790> for<00:01:48.060> something<00:01:48.329> that's<00:01:48.450> got

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
very difficult for something that's got

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:50.960 
very difficult for something that's got
more<00:01:49.799> horsepower<00:01:50.009> than<00:01:50.340> something<00:01:50.640> that<00:01:50.729> does

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
more horsepower than something that does

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.010 
more horsepower than something that does
and<00:01:51.119> they're<00:01:51.210> going<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.390> have<00:01:51.479> an<00:01:51.689> advantage

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
and they're going to have an advantage

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.620 
and they're going to have an advantage
and<00:01:52.590> that<00:01:52.649> was<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.729> so<00:01:54.090> I<00:01:54.149> don't<00:01:54.210> understand

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
and that was it so I don't understand

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.380 
and that was it so I don't understand
what<00:01:54.780> I've<00:01:54.869> taken<00:01:55.049> out<00:01:55.229> of<00:01:55.290> context<00:01:56.270> well<00:01:57.270> then

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
what I've taken out of context well then

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.840 
what I've taken out of context well then
you<00:01:57.689> know
