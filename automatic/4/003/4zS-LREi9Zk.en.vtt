to answer being that I do not know the
person<00:00:34.350> very<00:00:34.440> well<00:00:34.559> if<00:00:34.890> I<00:00:35.010> train<00:00:35.340> with<00:00:35.610> a

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
person very well if I train with a

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.280 
person very well if I train with a
person<00:00:36.120> I<00:00:36.270> have<00:00:36.570> an<00:00:36.660> idea<00:00:36.930> what<00:00:37.140> they<00:00:37.260> are

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
person I have an idea what they are

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.590 
person I have an idea what they are
doing<00:00:37.739> in<00:00:37.980> their<00:00:38.070> training<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.670> I<00:00:39.390> have<00:00:39.480> an

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
doing in their training and I have an

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.660 
doing in their training and I have an
idea<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:39.989> how<00:00:40.110> well<00:00:40.379> they<00:00:40.559> recover<00:00:40.920> so<00:00:41.309> it

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
idea of how well they recover so it

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.819 
idea of how well they recover so it
really<00:00:41.879> depends<00:00:42.300> on<00:00:42.629> your<00:00:43.110> individual

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
really depends on your individual

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.549 
really depends on your individual
characteristics<00:00:44.840> here's<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.050> thing<00:00:46.320> with

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
characteristics here's the thing with

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.970 
characteristics here's the thing with
Gerber's<00:00:47.570> actually<00:00:48.570> two<00:00:48.750> things<00:00:49.110> really<00:00:49.410> with

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
Gerber's actually two things really with

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.750 
Gerber's actually two things really with
purpose<00:00:50.399> um<00:00:50.870> first<00:00:51.870> off<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.379> grippers<00:00:52.829> have

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
purpose um first off the grippers have

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.850 
purpose um first off the grippers have
knurling<00:00:54.420> on<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.809> handle<00:00:55.230> so<00:00:55.440> they're<00:00:55.620> rough

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
knurling on the handle so they're rough

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.069 
knurling on the handle so they're rough
okay<00:00:56.640> so<00:00:56.699> when<00:00:57.059> you're<00:00:57.210> working<00:00:57.719> with<00:00:57.750> the

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
okay so when you're working with the

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.500 
okay so when you're working with the
grippers<00:00:58.940> especially<00:00:59.940> when<00:01:00.149> you're<00:01:00.270> brand

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
grippers especially when you're brand

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.319 
grippers especially when you're brand
new<00:01:00.600> with<00:01:00.870> grippers<00:01:01.260> your<00:01:01.559> hands<00:01:02.100> can<00:01:02.550> get

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
new with grippers your hands can get

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.320 
new with grippers your hands can get
sore<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.140> if<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:04.920> happens<00:01:05.610> that<00:01:05.909> can<00:01:06.090> throw

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
sore and if that happens that can throw

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.149 
sore and if that happens that can throw
off<00:01:06.630> your<00:01:06.750> other<00:01:07.080> training<00:01:07.619> because<00:01:07.979> your

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
off your other training because your

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.010 
off your other training because your
hands<00:01:08.369> will<00:01:08.580> be<00:01:08.729> slightly<00:01:09.030> you<00:01:09.630> know<00:01:09.659> they'll

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
hands will be slightly you know they'll

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.920 
hands will be slightly you know they'll
be<00:01:10.080> sensible<00:01:10.680> so<00:01:11.369> if<00:01:11.670> you're<00:01:11.880> doing<00:01:12.390> heavy

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
be sensible so if you're doing heavy

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.130 
be sensible so if you're doing heavy
rack<00:01:13.290> pulls<00:01:13.820> deadlifts<00:01:14.850> if<00:01:15.630> you're<00:01:15.840> working

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
rack pulls deadlifts if you're working

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.990 
rack pulls deadlifts if you're working
with<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.320> bar<00:01:16.560> like<00:01:16.860> bench<00:01:17.130> press<00:01:17.490> there's

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
with a bar like bench press there's

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.640 
with a bar like bench press there's
early<00:01:18.270> on<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.659> bar<00:01:18.840> there<00:01:19.049> as<00:01:19.170> well<00:01:19.350> so<00:01:19.530> we<00:01:19.619> can

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
early on the bar there as well so we can

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.440 
early on the bar there as well so we can
kind<00:01:20.009> of<00:01:20.070> you<00:01:20.759> know<00:01:20.850> your<00:01:21.000> hands<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.299> be<00:01:21.420> a

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
kind of you know your hands to be a

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.910 
kind of you know your hands to be a
little<00:01:21.689> bit<00:01:21.780> sensitive<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.439> might<00:01:22.560> throw<00:01:22.799> you

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
little bit sensitive it might throw you

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.130 
little bit sensitive it might throw you
off<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.070> little<00:01:23.310> bit<00:01:23.520> so<00:01:24.270> let's<00:01:24.450> take<00:01:24.689> that<00:01:24.720> into

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
off a little bit so let's take that into

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.890 
off a little bit so let's take that into
consideration<00:01:25.880> the<00:01:26.880> other<00:01:27.030> thing<00:01:27.360> is<00:01:27.570> if

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
consideration the other thing is if

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.990 
consideration the other thing is if
you're<00:01:28.650> squeezing<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.340> gripper<00:01:29.640> is<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.790> lot

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
you're squeezing the gripper is a lot

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.140 
you're squeezing the gripper is a lot
and<00:01:30.329> you're<00:01:30.479> really<00:01:31.280> bearing<00:01:32.280> down<00:01:32.310> that's

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
and you're really bearing down that's

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.550 
and you're really bearing down that's
that's<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.540> lot<00:01:33.689> of<00:01:33.750> tension<00:01:34.259> in<00:01:34.380> your<00:01:34.409> lower

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
that's a lot of tension in your lower

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.490 
that's a lot of tension in your lower
arms<00:01:35.159> okay<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.240> have<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.600> understand

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
arms okay and you have to understand

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.850 
arms okay and you have to understand
that<00:01:37.799> when<00:01:38.280> you

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
that when you

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.280 
that when you
easing<00:01:39.220> grippers<00:01:39.670> very<00:01:39.910> hard<00:01:40.180> like<00:01:40.390> that<00:01:40.660> that

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
easing grippers very hard like that that

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.680 
easing grippers very hard like that that
can<00:01:41.500> put<00:01:41.800> some<00:01:42.640> wear<00:01:42.820> and<00:01:43.000> tear<00:01:43.240> on<00:01:43.510> your

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
can put some wear and tear on your

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.520 
can put some wear and tear on your
muscles<00:01:44.110> and<00:01:44.410> your<00:01:44.680> connective<00:01:45.160> tissues<00:01:45.610> and

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
muscles and your connective tissues and

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.360 
muscles and your connective tissues and
people<00:01:47.530> that<00:01:47.650> get<00:01:47.890> a<00:01:47.920> little<00:01:48.040> overzealous

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:48.370 
people that get a little overzealous

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.970 
people that get a little overzealous
with<00:01:48.940> Gerber's<00:01:49.390> can<00:01:50.050> actually<00:01:50.620> have<00:01:50.770> some

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:50.980 
with Gerber's can actually have some

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.040 
with Gerber's can actually have some
tendon<00:01:51.370> pain<00:01:51.550> so<00:01:51.880> you<00:01:51.940> have<00:01:52.180> to<00:01:52.330> watch<00:01:52.510> that<00:01:52.780> as

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
tendon pain so you have to watch that as

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.520 
tendon pain so you have to watch that as
well

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
well

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.580 
well
so<00:01:54.010> once<00:01:54.790> you<00:01:55.060> figure<00:01:55.420> those<00:01:55.780> couple<00:01:56.320> things

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
so once you figure those couple things

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.350 
so once you figure those couple things
out<00:01:56.770> how<00:01:57.070> to<00:01:57.130> manage<00:01:57.520> those<00:01:57.729> then<00:01:58.150> your

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
out how to manage those then your

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.000 
out how to manage those then your
program<00:01:58.870> can<00:01:59.050> kind<00:01:59.290> of<00:01:59.380> write<00:01:59.530> itself

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 
program can kind of write itself

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.300 
program can kind of write itself
you<00:02:00.700> also<00:02:00.850> have<00:02:01.120> to<00:02:01.240> think<00:02:01.270> about<00:02:02.070> what<00:02:03.070> are

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
you also have to think about what are

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.000 
you also have to think about what are
you<00:02:03.460> training<00:02:03.729> with<00:02:03.940> the<00:02:04.120> grippers<00:02:04.479> for<00:02:05.010> if

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.010 
you training with the grippers for if

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.960 
you training with the grippers for if
your<00:02:06.340> objective<00:02:06.820> is<00:02:07.600> to<00:02:08.050> build<00:02:08.679> your<00:02:09.340> forearms

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
up and you've got groupers then you

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.580 
up and you've got groupers then you
probably<00:02:13.540> don't<00:02:13.720> need<00:02:13.870> to<00:02:13.990> do<00:02:14.140> too<00:02:14.410> much

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
probably don't need to do too much

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
stability on the back of the form but I

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.000 
stability on the back of the form but I
wouldn't<00:02:51.730> consider<00:02:51.910> grippers<00:02:52.810> to<00:02:53.140> be<00:02:53.320> like

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
wouldn't consider grippers to be like
