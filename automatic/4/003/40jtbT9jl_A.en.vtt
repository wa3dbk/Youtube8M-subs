00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:54.890

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:01.219
 bots that of professional difficulty that 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.289
 is the second easiest because in the 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:06.049

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.679
 comfortable and safe where it is already passed 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.970

 dead son of fruit to throw c4 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.700

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.310

 we encourage anyone to try to do 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:09.079
 this challenge to see if you leave because the 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.180

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.820
 Question 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:05.230
 you realize that we have not thrown in 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:07.120
 a stingy streak but what a streak we're going 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:08.860
 to throw in dispute or not but not that 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.610
 We could not say I got caught 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:15.130
 a weapon of the ground because as brave 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.720

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:30.090
 punitive that it does not get it no 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.090
 he killed it is mine is mine 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:34.060
 and so they carry all the extras and others 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:40.160
 distracted 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:43.220
 we have not won anything 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:45.440
 I'm going to put it, I'm going to put it in 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.760
 cinema so you can see how many they are 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.650
 from above you know how to plan 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:51.670
 move how many are they and how many are we 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:54.560
 us because this challenge is difficult 

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:56.030
 wiki and it reads is that we have not pulled in a 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.700
 run of losses because before we have to 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:00.980
 confess that we have tried it with 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:02.480
 easy difficulty and we are taking out there is 

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:04.880

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.420
 I would throw 60 around I was like no 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:17.660
 we encourage whoever is still 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:20.450

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:22.580
