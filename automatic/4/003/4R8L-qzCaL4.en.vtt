00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.890 
know we're going to have a difficult
shot<00:00:15.680> especially<00:00:16.680> if<00:00:17.130> we're<00:00:17.460> hanging<00:00:18.240> back<00:00:18.660> in

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
shot especially if we're hanging back in

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.240 
shot especially if we're hanging back in
our<00:00:19.020> normal<00:00:19.260> position<00:00:19.800> in<00:00:19.949> our<00:00:20.039> ready

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
our normal position in our ready

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.130 
our normal position in our ready
position<00:00:20.580> we're<00:00:21.390> going<00:00:21.420> to<00:00:21.570> have<00:00:21.689> to<00:00:21.779> really

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
position we're going to have to really

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.939 
position we're going to have to really
make<00:00:22.260> a<00:00:22.289> quick<00:00:22.590> move<00:00:22.619> without<00:00:24.529> banging<00:00:25.529> our

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
make a quick move without banging our

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.150 
make a quick move without banging our
legs<00:00:26.340> on<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:26.939> table<00:00:27.330> or<00:00:27.539> getting<00:00:28.230> hurt<00:00:28.439> in<00:00:28.650> the

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
legs on the table or getting hurt in the

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.540 
legs on the table or getting hurt in the
process<00:00:29.279> so<00:00:30.140> the<00:00:31.140> ball<00:00:31.380> basically<00:00:32.040> all<00:00:32.430> you're

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
process so the ball basically all you're

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.000 
process so the ball basically all you're
going<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.730> be<00:00:32.910> thinking<00:00:33.329> about<00:00:33.420> is<00:00:33.960> trying<00:00:34.829> to

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
going to be thinking about is trying to

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.040 
going to be thinking about is trying to
get<00:00:35.190> if<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.670> guys<00:00:35.850> hit<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.120> really<00:00:36.600> good<00:00:36.780> drop

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
get if the guys hit a really good drop

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.660 
get if the guys hit a really good drop
shot<00:00:37.350> that<00:00:37.590> barely<00:00:37.829> gets<00:00:38.070> over<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.340> net<00:00:38.489> or

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
shot that barely gets over the net or

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.280 
shot that barely gets over the net or
like<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:39.000> said<00:00:39.030> if<00:00:39.329> it<00:00:39.450> ticks<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.930> net<00:00:40.110> and

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
like I said if it ticks the net and

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.979 
like I said if it ticks the net and
you're<00:00:40.440> having<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.770> make<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.219> last<00:00:41.520> second

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
you're having to make a last second

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.250 
you're having to make a last second
defensive<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.140> shot<00:00:43.530> what<00:00:44.430> your<00:00:44.879> idea<00:00:45.780> is<00:00:45.870> is

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
defensive a shot what your idea is is

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.850 
defensive a shot what your idea is is
just<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.649> get<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.950> ball<00:00:47.100> over<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.730> net<00:00:47.760> so<00:00:48.860> the

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
just to get the ball over the net so the

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.860 
just to get the ball over the net so the
way<00:00:50.010> that<00:00:50.039> I<00:00:50.219> usually<00:00:50.550> accomplish<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:51.210> is<00:00:51.360> you

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
way that I usually accomplish it is you

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.170 
way that I usually accomplish it is you
have<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.320> be<00:00:52.469> focused<00:00:52.739> keep<00:00:53.460> your<00:00:53.640> eyes<00:00:53.789> on<00:00:53.820> the

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
have to be focused keep your eyes on the

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.350 
have to be focused keep your eyes on the
ball<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:54.750> make<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.890> good<00:00:56.100> jump<00:00:56.460> right<00:00:56.670> as

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
ball and make it a good jump right as

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.209 
ball and make it a good jump right as
you<00:00:57.510> know<00:00:57.539> as<00:00:58.320> soon<00:00:58.350> as<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:58.680> know<00:00:58.859> that<00:00:59.100> the

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
you know as soon as you know that the

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.310 
you know as soon as you know that the
ball<00:00:59.370> is<00:00:59.399> going<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.760> be<00:00:59.879> a<00:01:00.059> short<00:01:00.149> shot<00:01:00.750> you

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
ball is going to be a short shot you

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.930 
ball is going to be a short shot you
have<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.800> react<00:01:02.070> with<00:01:02.340> as<00:01:02.489> quickly<00:01:02.730> as

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
have to react with as quickly as

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.840 
have to react with as quickly as
possible<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:04.229> usually<00:01:04.650> just<00:01:04.680> if<00:01:05.519> I'm<00:01:05.700> in

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
possible and I usually just if I'm in

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.640 
possible and I usually just if I'm in
the<00:01:05.880> ready<00:01:06.119> position<00:01:06.210> I'm<00:01:06.840> turning<00:01:07.500> I'm

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
the ready position I'm turning I'm

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.580 
the ready position I'm turning I'm
lunging<00:01:08.340> in<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.880> maybe<00:01:09.479> I'm<00:01:09.930> hitting<00:01:10.439> a

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
lunging in and maybe I'm hitting a

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.950 
lunging in and maybe I'm hitting a
little<00:01:11.460> bit<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:11.760> under<00:01:12.060> spin<00:01:12.299> with<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.720> shot

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
little bit of under spin with the shot

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.200 
little bit of under spin with the shot
but<00:01:13.650> I'm<00:01:13.740> just<00:01:13.950> trying<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.400> place<00:01:14.640> it<00:01:14.670> may<00:01:15.150> be

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
but I'm just trying to place it may be

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.530 
but I'm just trying to place it may be
in<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.570> corner<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.229> or<00:01:16.950> just<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:18.090> get<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.390> ball

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
in a corner and or just to get the ball

barely<00:01:18.930> over<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.259> net<00:01:19.530> if<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.610> guy<00:01:20.790> if<00:01:21.390> your

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
barely over the net if the guy if your

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.929 
barely over the net if the guy if your
opponent<00:01:21.810> is<00:01:22.170> on<00:01:22.530> one<00:01:23.280> side<00:01:23.490> of<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.640> table<00:01:23.759> at

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
opponent is on one side of the table at

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.340 
opponent is on one side of the table at
other<00:01:24.180> obviously<00:01:24.810> you're<00:01:24.990> going<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.170> try<00:01:25.320> to

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
other obviously you're going to try to

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.249 
other obviously you're going to try to
go<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.680> other<00:01:25.770> side<00:01:26.070> I<00:01:27.000> don't<00:01:27.960> think<00:01:28.049> I

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
go to the other side I don't think I

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.600 
go to the other side I don't think I
would<00:01:28.380> want<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.680> try<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:28.920> hit<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.189> ball<00:01:29.340> deep

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
would want to try to hit the ball deep

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.359 
would want to try to hit the ball deep
because<00:01:30.530> chances<00:01:31.530> are<00:01:31.799> you're<00:01:31.979> going<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.159> pop

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
it up and he's going to slam it down

the ball over the net come up quickly
maybe<00:01:41.220> even<00:01:41.400> put<00:01:41.579> a<00:01:41.610> little<00:01:41.759> under<00:01:42.060> spin<00:01:42.270> on<00:01:42.509> or

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.990 
maybe even put a little under spin on or
you<00:01:43.200> can<00:01:43.350> hit<00:01:43.530> with<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.040> little<00:01:44.310> bit<00:01:44.460> of<00:01:44.520> topspin

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
you can hit with a little bit of topspin

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.060 
you can hit with a little bit of topspin
just<00:01:45.210> rolling<00:01:45.479> your<00:01:45.630> wrists<00:01:45.840> over<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.320> try<00:01:47.009> to

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
just rolling your wrists over and try to

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.440 
just rolling your wrists over and try to
get<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.340> ball<00:01:47.490> back<00:01:47.700> in<00:01:47.880> place<00:01:48.119> so<00:01:48.299> we're

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
get the ball back in place so we're

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.760 
get the ball back in place so we're
going<00:01:48.540> to<00:01:48.630> go<00:01:48.750> ahead<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.110> give<00:01:49.229> it<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.470> try

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
going to go ahead and give it a try

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:56.510 
going to go ahead and give it a try
right<00:01:50.189> now<00:01:54.200> so<00:01:55.200> as<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.380> see<00:01:55.680> you<00:01:55.890> can<00:01:56.040> chop

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
right now so as you see you can chop

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.330 
right now so as you see you can chop
away<00:01:56.549> the<00:01:57.060> ball<00:01:57.240> and<00:01:57.770> actually<00:01:58.770> even<00:01:59.219> though

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
away the ball and actually even though

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.109 
away the ball and actually even though
it's<00:01:59.520> a<00:01:59.610> defensive<00:02:00.299> shot<00:02:01.219> you<00:02:02.219> can<00:02:02.399> get<00:02:02.670> some

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
it's a defensive shot you can get some

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.030 
it's a defensive shot you can get some
good<00:02:03.299> results<00:02:03.509> offensively<00:02:04.380> if<00:02:04.649> you<00:02:04.770> put

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
good results offensively if you put

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.639 
good results offensively if you put
enough<00:02:05.219> of<00:02:05.610> a<00:02:05.640> little<00:02:06.540> bit<00:02:06.630> of<00:02:06.750> a<00:02:06.840> slice<00:02:07.200> on<00:02:07.469> it

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
enough of a little bit of a slice on it

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.760 
enough of a little bit of a slice on it
and<00:02:07.799> angle<00:02:08.610> it<00:02:08.729> at<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:08.970> same<00:02:09.209> time<00:02:09.770> and

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
and angle it at the same time and

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.040 
and angle it at the same time and
basically<00:02:11.550> like<00:02:12.270> I<00:02:12.330> said<00:02:12.510> you're<00:02:12.629> just<00:02:12.660> trying

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
basically like I said you're just trying

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.400 
basically like I said you're just trying
to<00:02:13.110> keep

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
to keep

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.580 
to keep
ball<00:02:13.590> in<00:02:13.830> play<00:02:14.100> and<00:02:14.420> if<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.780> guy<00:02:15.930> is<00:02:15.990> your

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
ball in play and if the guy is your

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.320 
ball in play and if the guy is your
opponent<00:02:17.010> is<00:02:17.070> in<00:02:17.220> a<00:02:17.310> bad<00:02:17.520> position<00:02:17.730> on<00:02:18.150> his

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
opponent is in a bad position on his

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.060 
opponent is in a bad position on his
side<00:02:18.540> of<00:02:18.660> the<00:02:18.750> net<00:02:18.990> then<00:02:19.650> you<00:02:19.770> can<00:02:19.920> take

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
side of the net then you can take

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.860 
side of the net then you can take
advantage<00:02:20.610> of<00:02:20.760> it<00:02:20.910> but<00:02:21.240> most<00:02:21.480> of<00:02:21.570> the<00:02:21.690> time

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
advantage of it but most of the time

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.330 
advantage of it but most of the time
it's<00:02:22.080> just<00:02:22.110> going<00:02:22.320> to<00:02:22.350> be<00:02:22.410> a<00:02:22.500> defensive<00:02:23.100> shot

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
it's just going to be a defensive shot

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.900 
it's just going to be a defensive shot
trying<00:02:24.180> to<00:02:24.330> stay<00:02:24.480> in<00:02:24.600> the<00:02:24.660> point
