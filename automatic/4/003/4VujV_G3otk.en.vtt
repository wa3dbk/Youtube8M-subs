00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:04.879
 welcome to lesson number 12 of 

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:06.529
 guitar for beginners 

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:08.750
 Now let's learn a new chord 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:13.009
 of the accord of fame I am in agreement 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:15.219
 normally it's difficult is feared by 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:15.219
 everyone 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.179
 this we all have 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.579
 we do not hear confiscation is impossible 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:25.550
 sound but with practice what 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:27.890
 we achieved very well the first one is behind you 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.380
 will advise doubles on music 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.149
 whole we cross all the schools the 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.579
 second finger we put in the third 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:36.530
 rope the fifth finger in the fifth 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:40.150
 tc cord behind the fourth finger in 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.150
 the fourth strings of the room 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.660
 now they withdraw us normally they put 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.690
 after that no matter a secret this is 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.690
 a secret to make it sound more 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.760
 pressure does not make him in 01 because if 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.980
 you in the pressure here forget about 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.409
 the pressure of these then ni 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.060
 they are in pain because they do not have 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:14.330
 enough response and neither do we 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:18.890
 we press and it does not sound they must have a lot 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:21.170
 really care the secret is that the 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.380
 pressure with what you do is with this 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.149
 chubby part on the first finger and it 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.080
 does the pressure only the first and 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:32.400
 second rope if you notice 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.400
 well advanced 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.659
 it's not all finger pressure 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.030
 then they are only the first two 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.890
 strings because because the third 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.720
 rope is already started with the second finger 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.909
 the fifth school starts with the 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.840
 third and the fourth is stepped on with the 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:53.860
 fourth then there is no need to 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.670
 press all schools because 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.670
 these are already 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:05.560
 is the front part of the pressure 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:08.349
 they are only the first and second with this 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.190
 Chubby part of the index finger of the first 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:17.170
 finger would be in the left hand 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:20.569
 clarifies these 12 and these are clarified 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:24.349
 perfectly this is the secret of not 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:26.090
 press everything press these as 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:28.459
 you in this election already have more 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.950
 practice in changing the impression to 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:34.599
 fingers that are mentioned in these and the 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.599
 two ropes down that would be 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.140
 and whether they are there or not 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:01.670
 very well now that we already know fa greater 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.989
 let's make the change with C major 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.989
 we put domaio 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.850
 22 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.850
 one 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:33.050
 2 to 1 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:33.050
 in 12 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.640
 two 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.540
 one 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:04:00.099
 and that's it in lesson number 12 2 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.980
 for a little bit more complicated for the 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:05.080
 left hand and another path once 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.120
 you have accomplished this then go 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.970
 to move on to the next lesson we're going 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.220
 to see more chords and let's see if 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.019
 is that we already started seeing a few 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.389
 songs because we already have domain to 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:18.310
 humans and sometimes we see the 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:20.260
 Easy songs in ballad rhythm 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.860
 remember that we are now watching the 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.930
 rhythm of ballad 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.360
 so that you can perfect 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.219
 this is a rhythm as I said in the 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.770
 first videos is a rhythm that helps 

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:34.379
 a lot is a lemon and in square and the 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:38.520
 easy pace for one to be able to start 

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:40.229
 synchronize both hands in both 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.449
 chords as the rhythm and to be able 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:44.879
 then sing a lot of practice with this 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:46.500
 rhythm and all the chords and go 

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:49.289
 uniting all what we have seen 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.960
 previously they go joining 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:54.330
 let's see what we have for the lesson 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.809
 number 13 see you in lesson number 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.809
