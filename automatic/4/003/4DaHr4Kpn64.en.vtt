actually do not sell this style anymore
they<00:02:05.670> have<00:02:05.700> like<00:02:06.210> one<00:02:06.240> called<00:02:06.719> a<00:02:06.810> small<00:02:07.049> and

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
they have like one called a small and

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.139 
they have like one called a small and
one<00:02:07.590> called<00:02:07.860> a<00:02:07.950> medium<00:02:08.340> but<00:02:08.640> it's<00:02:08.759> still<00:02:08.970> not

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
one called a medium but it's still not

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.760 
one called a medium but it's still not
the<00:02:09.330> same<00:02:09.569> and<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:09.929> dimensions<00:02:10.410> aren't<00:02:10.590> the

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
the same and the dimensions aren't the

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.990 
the same and the dimensions aren't the
same<00:02:10.979> at<00:02:11.129> all<00:02:11.220> so<00:02:11.970> uh

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
same at all so uh

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.430 
same at all so uh
so<00:02:13.150> you<00:02:13.210> might<00:02:13.390> just<00:02:13.600> look<00:02:13.750> at<00:02:13.960> you<00:02:14.320> know<00:02:14.410> the

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
so you might just look at you know the

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.020 
so you might just look at you know the
dimensions<00:02:14.890> compared<00:02:15.220> to<00:02:15.280> this<00:02:15.460> compared<00:02:15.970> to

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
dimensions compared to this compared to

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.640 
dimensions compared to this compared to
one<00:02:16.420> that<00:02:16.600> you're<00:02:16.720> gonna<00:02:16.810> purchase<00:02:17.110> if<00:02:17.530> you

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
one that you're gonna purchase if you

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.610 
one that you're gonna purchase if you
are<00:02:17.890> gonna<00:02:18.040> purchase<00:02:18.490> one<00:02:19.140> so<00:02:20.140> hopefully<00:02:20.440> it

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
are gonna purchase one so hopefully it

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.530 
are gonna purchase one so hopefully it
still<00:02:20.890> helps<00:02:21.190> though<00:02:21.370> and<00:02:21.760> they<00:02:22.150> just<00:02:22.330> wanted

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
still helps though and they just wanted

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.420 
still helps though and they just wanted

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
here so check out my other video to see

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.979 
here so check out my other video to see
how<00:03:42.790> much<00:03:43.090> you<00:03:43.239> can<00:03:43.360> hold<00:03:43.630> because<00:03:43.870> I

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
how much you can hold because I

absolutely just love this back and then
now<00:03:46.150> I'm<00:03:46.299> just<00:03:46.450> gonna<00:03:46.540> do<00:03:46.870> some<00:03:47.170> quick<00:03:47.410> ones

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
now I'm just gonna do some quick ones

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.000 
now I'm just gonna do some quick ones
with<00:03:47.739> this<00:03:47.950> and<00:03:48.220> then<00:03:48.340> just<00:03:48.370> show<00:03:48.610> you<00:03:48.670> compare

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
with this and then just show you compare

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:55.110 
with this and then just show you compare
so<00:03:51.010> you<00:03:51.070> can<00:03:51.400> just<00:03:51.549> kind<00:03:52.120> of<00:03:53.820> hold<00:03:54.820> it<00:03:55.000> like

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
so you can just kind of hold it like

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.520 
so you can just kind of hold it like
that<00:03:55.150> see<00:03:55.450> how<00:03:55.540> much<00:03:55.690> smaller<00:03:56.019> that<00:03:56.290> looks

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
that see how much smaller that looks

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.470 
that see how much smaller that looks
like<00:03:56.829> I<00:03:57.100> don't<00:03:57.549> know<00:03:57.730> I<00:03:57.940> think<00:03:58.060> it<00:03:58.299> looks<00:03:58.450> a
