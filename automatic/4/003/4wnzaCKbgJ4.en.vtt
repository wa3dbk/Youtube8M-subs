00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 hi deserters with you propose 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.879
 take a look at ios 9 beta 4 or 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.879
 public second drove 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:22.730
 July 21 just before nine o'clock as 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:26.060
 usually apple loves they released and weight 9 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:29.540
 beta 4 and today 22 at 9 o'clock they 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:32.630
 released ios9 public beta 2 well that is 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.280
 a person with the same firmware number 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:38.270
 start with the build number 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.770
 the same but already for public tests 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.530
 there is still it done to see 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.750
 so that we can be confident in you 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.700
 the fact that do not allow their stocks and then 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.620
 they get themselves from the trust whether it is and 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.960
 released but it seems to me really 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.640
 in another way they just didn't let them do 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.649
 high server load but because 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.239
 only glitch was recently linked with Beats you 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:58.100
 help nominations teammates 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:59.839
 I had to listen to them too 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.370
 avalanche collapsed services that's not 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:03.379
 survived such an influx so yesterday 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.269
 did not distribute the firmware for developers and 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.400
 today they distributed firmware for everyone 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:13.010
 the rest who are recorded on beta tests 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:15.920
 Orsha new firmware 90 mid bell 1340 305 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.850
 Mr. but it's nothing we unfortunately did not 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.160
 says this 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.570
 yourself from the previous firmware is not enough 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.880
 go search spotlight right 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.590
 here we have appeared now we can 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.660
 turn off to the web the result of their dna 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.520
 we were not shown in the spotlight search and 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.690
 change two icons in the settings of this 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.800
 battery bolt notification icons 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.960
 and now we have to race just 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.450
 battery brought in divine form then 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.630
 there is 1 such and should be and if we 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.590
 Now let's go to your special location. 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.840
 and see all 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.730
 edicts because we had the edge 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.880
 squares now we have it too 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:50.040
 rounded and it is good at a construction site 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.950
 music moved and now we have 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.780
 aim or do to play back and doblas then 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.060
 we have now we can not choose 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.250
 so that there is only high quality 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.830
 when we are listening via cellular 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.870
 network and that's just such a thing before us 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.660
 It was the settings of iTunes and the appstore 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.280
 Now this music is an application mail from us 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.619
 now everything is in English that is 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.450
 all the boxes and everything we have written on 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.370
 English apparently yes inventing 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.950
 better way by the way 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.240
 top transfer and now low mode 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.860
 salt supply in the same section 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.300
 battery is called mode 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.910
 energy saving 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.980
 I think so right and so beautiful and 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.900
 in fact, this is probably all 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.880
 innovation which is more or less 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.530
 meaningful a little bit would be faster 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.900
 a little pillar smoother less 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.640
 zabagovannosti but still it is again in 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.680
 That is, I do not advise you to bet on 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.650
 working device but i go with it and 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.420
 in principle, already with the first misery and grief do not 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.880
 I know yes, Yandex navigator does not work 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.530
 but this is a problem in Yandex or yes before 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.570
 your application will be fine with you 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.430
