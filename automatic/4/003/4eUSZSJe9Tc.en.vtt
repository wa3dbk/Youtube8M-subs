00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:47.379 
them back sakio bika that was the guy
was<00:01:45.950> thinking<00:01:46.100> of<00:01:46.369> he<00:01:46.490> was<00:01:46.579> able<00:01:46.789> to<00:01:46.850> even<00:01:47.119> push

00:01:47.379 --> 00:01:47.389 
was thinking of he was able to even push

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:48.730 
was thinking of he was able to even push
sakio<00:01:47.810> bika<00:01:47.840> back<00:01:48.289> and<00:01:48.469> Beeker<00:01:48.709> is

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
sakio bika back and Beeker is

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.919 
sakio bika back and Beeker is
terrifically<00:01:49.429> strong<00:01:49.789> so<00:01:50.359> if<00:01:50.509> he<00:01:50.659> was<00:01:50.810> to

00:01:50.919 --> 00:01:50.929 
terrifically strong so if he was to

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:52.300 
terrifically strong so if he was to
fight<00:01:51.109> golovkin<00:01:51.259> he<00:01:51.679> would<00:01:51.799> have<00:01:51.950> to<00:01:52.069> employ

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
fight golovkin he would have to employ

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.489 
fight golovkin he would have to employ
that<00:01:52.549> type<00:01:52.759> of<00:01:52.789> tactic<00:01:53.240> get<00:01:53.959> gloves<00:01:54.200> get<00:01:54.409> on

00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:54.499 
that type of tactic get gloves get on

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:57.999 
that type of tactic get gloves get on
the<00:01:54.590> back<00:01:54.770> foot<00:01:55.039> and<00:01:55.219> the<00:01:56.060> love<00:01:56.630> king<00:01:56.899> most<00:01:57.829> of

to<00:02:02.389> push<00:02:02.659> him<00:02:02.810> back<00:02:02.959> maybe<00:02:03.590> you<00:02:03.799> can<00:02:04.009> take<00:02:04.189> his

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
to push him back maybe you can take his

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:06.029 
to push him back maybe you can take his
power<00:02:04.579> away<00:02:04.850> that's<00:02:05.090> what<00:02:05.240> i'll<00:02:05.389> be<00:02:05.420> going<00:02:05.810> for

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
he's similar to someone that Marcos

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.240 
he's similar to someone that Marcos
Maidana<00:02:55.970> in<00:02:56.540> the<00:02:56.630> sense<00:02:56.900> that<00:02:56.989> his<00:02:57.680> punches

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
Maidana in the sense that his punches

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.509 
Maidana in the sense that his punches
are<00:02:58.430> slow<00:02:59.239> and<00:02:59.269> deliberate<00:02:59.930> but<00:03:00.680> there's<00:03:01.430> a

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
are slow and deliberate but there's a

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:03.250 
are slow and deliberate but there's a
hell<00:03:01.790> of<00:03:01.819> a<00:03:02.030> lot<00:03:02.150> of<00:03:02.180> weight<00:03:02.450> behind<00:03:02.660> them<00:03:03.080> and

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
hell of a lot of weight behind them and

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.290 
hell of a lot of weight behind them and
he's<00:03:03.980> definitely<00:03:04.160> obviously<00:03:04.940> got<00:03:05.090> better

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
he's definitely obviously got better

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.390 
he's definitely obviously got better
technique<00:03:05.690> de<00:03:05.870> Marcos<00:03:06.200> Maidana<00:03:06.350> and<00:03:06.890> I'm<00:03:07.190> not

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
technique de Marcos Maidana and I'm not

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.610 
technique de Marcos Maidana and I'm not
comparing<00:03:07.730> him<00:03:08.000> overall<00:03:08.569> as<00:03:08.720> a<00:03:08.750> fighter<00:03:09.080> I'm

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
comparing him overall as a fighter I'm

comparing him overall as a fighter I'm
just<00:03:09.980> talking<00:03:10.489> about<00:03:10.550> his<00:03:10.819> punching<00:03:11.269> power

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
just talking about his punching power

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.559 
just talking about his punching power
when<00:03:12.470> he<00:03:12.590> throw<00:03:12.800> shots<00:03:13.130> they're<00:03:14.060> much<00:03:14.300> more

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
when he throw shots they're much more

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:17.740 
when he throw shots they're much more
neat<00:03:15.380> and<00:03:15.620> compact<00:03:15.920> than<00:03:16.700> most<00:03:17.209> of<00:03:17.390> my<00:03:17.420> Dyna

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
neat and compact than most of my Dyna

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.440 
neat and compact than most of my Dyna
shots<00:03:18.110> he<00:03:18.650> does<00:03:18.890> frodi<00:03:19.220> unorthodox<00:03:20.000> shots<00:03:20.269> now

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
shots he does frodi unorthodox shots now

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:21.850

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:34.990 
doesn't look explosive when he throw
shots<00:03:32.660> but<00:03:33.290> the<00:03:33.860> power<00:03:34.100> is<00:03:34.220> that<00:03:34.310> you<00:03:34.670> know<00:03:34.790> in

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
shots but the power is that you know in

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.789 
shots but the power is that you know in
the<00:03:35.030> effect<00:03:35.480> they<00:03:35.870> has<00:03:36.049> only<00:03:36.230> opponents<00:03:36.739> as

you<00:03:36.890> can<00:03:37.040> see<00:03:37.220> no<00:03:37.640> shots<00:03:37.910> obviously<00:03:38.090> have<00:03:38.780> a

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
you can see no shots obviously have a

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.360 
you can see no shots obviously have a
tremendous<00:03:39.260> amount<00:03:39.350> weight<00:03:39.650> behind<00:03:39.799> him<00:03:40.100> and

during his Stephenson a few fights back
because<00:05:35.960> I<00:05:36.020> think<00:05:36.080> Stephens<00:05:36.530> to<00:05:36.620> slip<00:05:36.860> in<00:05:37.010> now

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:37.130 
because I think Stephens to slip in now

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:39.339 
because I think Stephens to slip in now
that<00:05:37.940> might<00:05:38.180> be<00:05:38.360> a<00:05:38.389> guy<00:05:38.630> that<00:05:38.840> has<00:05:38.990> the<00:05:39.020> power

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:39.349 
that might be a guy that has the power

00:05:39.349 --> 00:05:40.930 
that might be a guy that has the power
to<00:05:39.440> keep<00:05:39.650> him<00:05:39.830> off<00:05:39.919> or<00:05:40.160> a<00:05:40.190> cover<00:05:40.430> level<00:05:40.789> though

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:40.940 
to keep him off or a cover level though

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.180 
to keep him off or a cover level though
with<00:05:41.389> Kovalev<00:05:41.900> him<00:05:42.530> and<00:05:42.680> girl<00:05:42.830> of<00:05:42.919> can<00:05:43.099> have

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.190 
with Kovalev him and girl of can have
