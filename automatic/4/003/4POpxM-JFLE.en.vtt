00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.370
 and actually from the first audition the siren dreamed and these two 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.919
 wind turbines worth dollars 

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:15.919
 good is hard to cry for 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:22.300
 the stentor 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.869
 the power of the first 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.470
 wesley sneijder may huntelaar must not have a grand and compelling 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.470
 madam on interpretation 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.880
 amersfoort people 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.810
 that you have to invest sometimes 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.080
 The sentiment includes people that you can touch people 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.470
 because someone like you say it after 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.300
 Utrecht felt good and that experienced Qaida part becomes more and more credits 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.410
 for a waste race 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.250
 a certain tension and 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.270
 I hope I have a profit from more than a hundred other countries 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.270
 the main roles 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.720
 mr a june 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.350
 a stunt 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.700
 the union 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.700
 after a medical reason 

00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:25.709
 the applicants 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.089
 there are decency rules 

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:31.789
 with a mini-lift 

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:34.789
 we have a very 

00:02:55.419 --> 00:02:56.529
 what the nicest 

00:02:56.529 --> 00:02:59.849
 I think it is real that you sometimes seem relaxed 

00:03:00.499 --> 00:03:03.689
 and usually you have that even when you sing now I don't know all the time 

00:03:04.679 --> 00:03:07.679
 a large part but I think you are a bit crooked 

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:10.969
 then that alone is me sick 

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:12.549
 have some fun 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:15.549
 we are very satisfied to drive a total length of thirty meters 

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:25.519
 what a pity about this is that it is a fairly unknown number to join me again 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:28.030
 you think she has a disadvantage 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.030
 but what a beautiful voice and guitar 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:39.089
 consequence would not surprise me if she gets in the resit 

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:42.089
 but that also has to do with not agreeing with the number 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:45.849
 maria heather 

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:51.409
 Then again we have another man who does not himself and this is the number 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:53.450
 what suits you best as the man 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.450
 what a beautiful voice it is 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:04.649
 week criticism 

00:04:04.649 --> 00:04:08.329
 I guess she would be ahead of the number six if you were so tense today 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:09.359
 the performance 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:12.460
 And then at the auditions not really very much now 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:15.779
 yes when those people see I see your family and loved ones 

00:04:15.779 --> 00:04:18.439
 he is welcome in estonia 

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:21.439
 Well thought you were very, very good 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.930
 he had drunk too much 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.180
 good in a response know how to work 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.580
 especially for the so-called kyoto sensitive chord 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.140
 currently has a new life according to him it is nac he did not
