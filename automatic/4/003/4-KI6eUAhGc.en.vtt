00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
right away when I first tried it and

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.439 
right away when I first tried it and
obviously<00:00:23.160> I<00:00:23.220> think<00:00:23.340> you<00:00:23.760> could<00:00:23.939> probably<00:00:24.029> see

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
there is this pressure dampening ring

profile<00:00:30.630> system<00:00:31.410> some<00:00:31.890> crazy<00:00:32.160> thing<00:00:32.520> that

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
profile system some crazy thing that

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.100 
profile system some crazy thing that
sounds<00:00:32.820> like<00:00:33.000> it's<00:00:33.180> made<00:00:33.360> from<00:00:33.540> outer<00:00:33.780> space

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
sounds like it's made from outer space

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.979 
sounds like it's made from outer space
but<00:00:34.410> in<00:00:35.100> layman's<00:00:35.550> terms<00:00:35.790> basically<00:00:36.600> as<00:00:36.809> you

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
but in layman's terms basically as you

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.020 
but in layman's terms basically as you
can<00:00:37.020> tell<00:00:37.350> there's<00:00:37.920> extra<00:00:38.399> stuff<00:00:38.640> going<00:00:38.910> on

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
can tell there's extra stuff going on

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.910 
can tell there's extra stuff going on
here<00:00:39.090> on<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.420> drum<00:00:39.629> head<00:00:39.809> in<00:00:40.200> fact<00:00:40.530> it<00:00:40.710> looks

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
here on the drum head in fact it looks

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.770 
here on the drum head in fact it looks
pretty<00:00:41.129> similar<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.820> old<00:00:41.850> power<00:00:42.180> stroke<00:00:42.510> 3

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
pretty similar to the old power stroke 3

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.420 
pretty similar to the old power stroke 3
and<00:00:43.020> that's<00:00:43.320> because<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:43.680> is<00:00:43.800> made<00:00:44.010> out<00:00:44.040> of<00:00:44.219> the

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
and that's because it is made out of the

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.970 
and that's because it is made out of the
same<00:00:44.640> material<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.750> same<00:00:45.989> actual<00:00:46.440> drum<00:00:46.800> head

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
material that is in these drum heads so

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.330 
material that is in these drum heads so
you<00:00:49.379> know<00:00:49.680> it's<00:00:49.800> kind<00:00:49.950> of<00:00:50.010> cool<00:00:50.160> there's

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
you know it's kind of cool there's

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.130

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
resonance going on at the very most I

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.220 
resonance going on at the very most I
may<00:02:51.880> think<00:02:52.180> about<00:02:52.239> putting<00:02:52.540> a<00:02:52.690> towel<00:02:52.900> in<00:02:53.080> here
