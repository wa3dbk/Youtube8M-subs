this duplication different heads within
the<00:01:25.970> Kaiser<00:01:26.210> program<00:01:26.810> may<00:01:27.200> have<00:01:27.410> different

the Kaiser program may have different

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.310 
the Kaiser program may have different
dial<00:01:28.070> divisions<00:01:28.610> but<00:01:29.300> the<00:01:29.420> vernier<00:01:29.750> works<00:01:30.080> the

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
dial divisions but the vernier works the

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.860 
dial divisions but the vernier works the
same<00:01:30.530> way<00:01:30.850> dividing<00:01:31.850> the<00:01:32.030> dial<00:01:32.270> divisions

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:32.870 
same way dividing the dial divisions

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.680 
same way dividing the dial divisions
into<00:01:33.260> smaller<00:01:33.560> increments<00:01:34.090> the<00:01:35.090> dial<00:01:35.360> and

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:35.690 
into smaller increments the dial and

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.110 
into smaller increments the dial and
vernier<00:01:36.080> increments<00:01:36.710> are<00:01:37.070> always<00:01:37.520> marked<00:01:37.910> on

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:38.120 
vernier increments are always marked on

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.450 
vernier increments are always marked on
the<00:01:38.270> tool<00:01:38.480> now<00:01:39.440> that<00:01:39.650> we<00:01:39.770> are<00:01:39.890> ready<00:01:40.100> to<00:01:40.280> make<00:01:40.400> a

diameter adjustment we must first

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.160 
diameter adjustment we must first
determine<00:01:42.890> which<00:01:43.490> gold<00:01:44.000> dial<00:01:44.300> line<00:01:44.600> matches

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
determine which gold dial line matches

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.260 
determine which gold dial line matches
up<00:01:45.320> with<00:01:45.470> a<00:01:45.530> vernier<00:01:45.950> line<00:01:46.250> that<00:01:46.940> is<00:01:47.120> our

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
up with a vernier line that is our

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.380 
up with a vernier line that is our
starting<00:01:47.690> point<00:01:47.960> in<00:01:48.230> this<00:01:48.740> example<00:01:49.310> the<00:01:50.120> zero

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390

the third vernier line for the first

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.070 
the third vernier line for the first
example<00:01:55.160> we'll<00:01:55.700> make<00:01:55.850> a<00:01:55.880> positive<00:01:56.240> diameter

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
example we'll make a positive diameter

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.370 
example we'll make a positive diameter
adjustment<00:01:57.710> of<00:01:57.860> four<00:01:58.370> tenths<00:01:58.730> in<00:01:59.690> order<00:02:00.020> to<00:02:00.170> do

adjustment of four tenths in order to do

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.480 
adjustment of four tenths in order to do
this<00:02:00.590> we<00:02:01.370> rotate<00:02:01.850> the<00:02:02.060> dial<00:02:02.270> clockwise<00:02:02.630> as<00:02:03.490> we

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
this we rotate the dial clockwise as we

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.880 
this we rotate the dial clockwise as we
do<00:02:04.670> this<00:02:04.850> we<00:02:05.180> call<00:02:05.450> vernier<00:02:06.050> marks<00:02:06.470> in<00:02:06.650> the
