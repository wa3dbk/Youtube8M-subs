00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:21.270
 350 pounds in other pizzas 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.119
 standard means it's worth pizza 175 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.750
 rubles here is the price of 175 rubles 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.119

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:43.680
 and mushrooms is the same and pizza with mozzarella 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:47.579
