with Cydia applications so i found that

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.270 
with Cydia applications so i found that
way<00:00:33.300> easier<00:00:33.719> than<00:00:33.770> openings<00:00:35.570> changing<00:00:36.570> like

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
way easier than openings changing like

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.479 
way easier than openings changing like
uninstalling<00:00:38.280> it<00:00:39.110> so<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.620> get<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:40.920> just<00:00:41.250> want

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
uninstalling it so to get it just want

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.170 
uninstalling it so to get it just want
to<00:00:41.550> open<00:00:41.910> cydia<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:43.879> download<00:00:44.879> all<00:00:45.059> the
