00:06:00.369 --> 00:06:00.379 
different types of glue I found that

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:02.499 
different types of glue I found that
some<00:06:00.620> parts<00:06:00.979> work<00:06:01.189> better<00:06:01.400> with<00:06:01.819> the<00:06:02.120> liquid

00:06:02.499 --> 00:06:02.509 
some parts work better with the liquid

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:04.629 
some parts work better with the liquid
glue<00:06:02.779> but<00:06:03.110> some<00:06:03.409> parts<00:06:03.770> were<00:06:03.979> better<00:06:04.279> with

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:04.639 
glue but some parts were better with

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:07.480 
glue but some parts were better with
glue<00:06:04.939> sticks<00:06:05.330> so<00:06:05.689> yeah<00:06:06.469> it<00:06:06.710> was<00:06:06.830> a<00:06:06.860> little<00:06:07.129> time

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:07.490 
glue sticks so yeah it was a little time

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.760 
glue sticks so yeah it was a little time
consuming<00:06:07.639> but<00:06:08.449> I<00:06:08.719> think<00:06:09.080> the<00:06:09.289> end<00:06:09.469> result

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:09.770
