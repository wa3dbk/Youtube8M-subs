00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.190
 Hi everyone 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:09.780
 in this video we will see how to do a 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:12.090
 reduce the size of a video without 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:17.850
 reduce the quality but I just did a 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:19.650
 video and we see that it is too giant 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:24.029
 are 600 megs 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:29.070
 even if it lasts for an hour like a 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:34.190
 minute how but why it was designed 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:36.180
 for quality and therefore its qualities 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:40.850
 that this video did it with 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:43.530
 mobile and takes up 100 megs of tense video 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.269
 so let's open our browser 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:51.829
 favorite 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:51.829
 go on google and try and black 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:59.910
 Andrich 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:04.780
 and here it is open source video transcoder 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:09.820
 we click and open now there are others 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.450
 programs for example another is a lot 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.520
 popular 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.420
 man does not come to my mind as it is 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.530
 who loves 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:23.290
 however this is like because it has advanced 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:26.400
 also it is easy even if advances tolosa 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.400
 then it unloads 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:46.010
 here it is, it's done downloading the bank 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.590
 here's how it works installation yes 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.720
 Catches 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:56.520
 and on the bed 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:56.520
 but on the Mac on PC it's almost the same 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:19.080
 well what I will do and I open Texas whiskey 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.770
 my 600 euro video 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.710
 and he a rose and I will do 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:28.330
 will be to lower the quality 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:31.520
 environment 4 some to 22 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:34.760
 we see where the file will be saved and 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.650
 then you like play 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:40.489
 let's start retirement 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:44.090
 so it will take a while and we see that 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:47.810
 when he finished everything was ready 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:53.750
 we ask to see the files that have been 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:56.450
 created we have one of 600 mega that is 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:01.390
 the original one the one saved and one from 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.390
 35 media is what I had converted 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.710
 and I open both of you and look 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.710
 difference is there 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:21.260
 here we see if we see that of 600 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:24.930
 mega on the left while that 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:27.810
 compressed is on the right 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:29.790
 the difference is almost non-existent 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.340
 now maybe if he saw it all the screen 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:36.810
 video and put on youtube do not buy it 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:40.470
 let's see that the high compression has 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:42.239
 slightly removed the graininess of the 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.970
 video you see when the original video 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:47.010
 this is very grainy because it was 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:53.150
 dark and this video I did with the 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:57.860
 cell phone while I go to see the 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:04:03.780
 the area is much smoother 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:07.980
 artificially cleaned and the same 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:13.860
 even here in the darkest part and if 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:18.239
 I go further I can see it well 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:22.250
 that if I look for a very dark area for 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.250
 example these labels do 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:28.590
 we see that in the compressed version 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:33.600
 there is not all the noise in the 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:35.640
 less compressed version of 600 megs however 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:41.580
 let's say this is a 45 video 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:45.360
 seconds and 45 seconds 600 six hundred mega is 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:48.200
 a little bit so we say that the 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.850
 compression at least in my opinion 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.200
 especially in cases where they are videos 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.060
 made with the mobile phone therefore like 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.160
 the lighting that sucks 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:05:00.630
 let's say this is a compression 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:04.290
 I would say excellent and therefore is what 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:07.910
 I always make my videos below for 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.910
 this view is useful hello hello
