00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.160
 remember how we change our filter 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.799
 gasoline and we put liquid of lavinia 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.979
 actors we do not have any pressure on the 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.979
 system 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:17.910
 of gasoline open and close three times 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:21.550
 the switch 123 turn on your vehicle 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.650
 we got it right and it turned on 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.529
 if you can think of the 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.720
 injectors and then turn on the karma 34 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.759
 I do not recommend hours to turn it on 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.140
 immediately because because it stays in 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:35.649
 the city ​​and within the real of 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:38.260
 injectors please and what happens is going 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:40.290
 To take a long time to start the kart 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.820
 that is the last thing we need 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.949

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.769
 remember that this car does not get 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:49.690
 time there is no joking way sometimes 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:51.670
 the celebrities said that we had to move 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.980
 the coils did not believe me they do not see these 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.680
 vehicles do not get time on time 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:00.550
 what the distribution band that goes 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:03.699
 here you might change it every 70 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:06.950
 thousand kilometers if the public service is 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:09.590
 more often the lid 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.810
 this stage will appear for you to remove 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.090
 Our white cap mark Rossi is 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.770
 On , a little bit of oil comes out 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.729
 methane 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:23.030
 again because it does not come off a little 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:28.700
 oil so they agree to be with our 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:31.940
 giving special if it is 10 or 8 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.460
 millimeters let's proceed 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:38.250
 while the four screws appears 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:40.740

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.490
