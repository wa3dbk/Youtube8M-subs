lesson for y'all today i'm going to be

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.359 
lesson for y'all today i'm going to be
talking<00:00:15.420> a<00:00:15.660> little<00:00:15.690> bit<00:00:15.960> about<00:00:16.410> line<00:00:17.040> weight

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
talking a little bit about line weight

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.810 
talking a little bit about line weight
and<00:00:17.960> if<00:00:18.960> you'll<00:00:19.230> check<00:00:19.259> this<00:00:19.800> out<00:00:20.040> I've

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
and if you'll check this out I've

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.070 
and if you'll check this out I've
already<00:00:21.029> gone<00:00:21.300> in<00:00:21.570> and<00:00:21.869> drawn<00:00:23.300> just<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.449> loose

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
already gone in and drawn just a loose

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.790 
already gone in and drawn just a loose
cube<00:00:25.820> and<00:00:26.820> as<00:00:27.660> you<00:00:27.779> can<00:00:27.900> see<00:00:27.930> all<00:00:28.050> these<00:00:28.439> red

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
cube and as you can see all these red

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.390 
cube and as you can see all these red
lines<00:00:29.090> here<00:00:30.090> are<00:00:30.119> all<00:00:30.600> of<00:00:30.949> basically<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.160> same

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:32.400 
lines here are all of basically the same

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.439 
lines here are all of basically the same
thickness<00:00:33.890> which<00:00:35.059> kind<00:00:36.059> of<00:00:36.120> leaves<00:00:36.330> the

00:00:36.439 --> 00:00:36.449 
thickness which kind of leaves the

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:38.420 
thickness which kind of leaves the
drawing<00:00:36.690> looking<00:00:37.080> a<00:00:37.260> little<00:00:37.650> bit<00:00:37.830> flat<00:00:38.160> at

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
drawing looking a little bit flat at

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.709 
drawing looking a little bit flat at
least<00:00:38.640> in<00:00:38.760> my<00:00:38.910> mind<00:00:39.290> but<00:00:40.290> by<00:00:41.010> taking<00:00:41.910> you<00:00:42.600> know

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
least in my mind but by taking you know

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.299 
least in my mind but by taking you know
picking<00:00:43.079> certain<00:00:43.440> lines<00:00:43.649> in<00:00:43.920> certain<00:00:44.219> areas

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
picking certain lines in certain areas

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.340 
picking certain lines in certain areas
and<00:00:44.670> kind<00:00:44.879> of<00:00:44.969> like<00:00:45.090> even<00:00:45.719> making<00:00:46.200> them<00:00:46.320> a

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
and kind of like even making them a

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.020 
and kind of like even making them a
little<00:00:46.559> bit<00:00:46.739> thicker<00:00:46.980> or<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.520> little<00:00:47.910> bit

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
little bit thicker or a little bit

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.900 
little bit thicker or a little bit
thinner<00:00:48.360> you<00:00:49.290> can<00:00:49.469> really<00:00:49.800> just<00:00:50.309> kind<00:00:50.700> of<00:00:50.730> like

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
thinner you can really just kind of like

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.450 
thinner you can really just kind of like
give<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.239> lot<00:00:51.510> of<00:00:51.570> life<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.050> line<00:00:52.289> drawing<00:00:52.559> so

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
give a lot of life to a line drawing so

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.590 
give a lot of life to a line drawing so
let's<00:00:53.610> want<00:00:53.760> them<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:53.910> go<00:00:54.000> ahead<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.420> do<00:00:54.510> here

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
let's want them to go ahead and do here

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.119 
let's want them to go ahead and do here
first<00:00:57.600> off<00:00:57.840> I'm<00:00:58.170> going<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.379> decide<00:00:58.680> where<00:00:58.980> my

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
first off I'm going to decide where my

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.369 
first off I'm going to decide where my
light<00:00:59.340> source<00:00:59.670> is<00:00:59.850> coming<00:00:59.910> from<00:01:00.210> now<00:01:00.660> your

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
light source is coming from now your

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.650 
light source is coming from now your
light<00:01:01.590> source<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:02.100> basically<00:01:03.000> just<00:01:03.030> like<00:01:03.510> the

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
light source is basically just like the

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.590 
light source is basically just like the
primary<00:01:04.199> direction<00:01:04.770> that<00:01:05.190> your<00:01:06.090> light<00:01:06.330> is

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
primary direction that your light is

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.420 
primary direction that your light is
going<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:06.930> be<00:01:07.080> hitting<00:01:07.259> this<00:01:07.440> from<00:01:07.740> I'm<00:01:08.039> going

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
going to be hitting this from I'm going

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.679 
going to be hitting this from I'm going
to<00:01:08.550> decide<00:01:08.970> that<00:01:09.570> my<00:01:10.170> light<00:01:10.410> source<00:01:10.799> is<00:01:11.689> kind

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
to decide that my light source is kind

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.690 
to decide that my light source is kind
of<00:01:12.750> up<00:01:12.869> here<00:01:13.200> in<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.439> top<00:01:13.790> corner<00:01:14.990> I'll<00:01:15.990> just

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
of up here in the top corner I'll just

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.330 
of up here in the top corner I'll just
draw<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.729> little<00:01:18.920> quickie<00:01:19.920> lamp<00:01:20.369> in<00:01:20.610> there<00:01:20.820> I

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
draw a little quickie lamp in there I

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.570 
draw a little quickie lamp in there I
don't<00:01:23.340> always<00:01:23.610> do<00:01:23.790> this<00:01:23.939> but<00:01:25.130> if<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:26.280> helps<00:01:26.520> you

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
don't always do this but if it helps you

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.030 
don't always do this but if it helps you
remember<00:01:28.580> so<00:01:29.580> my<00:01:29.850> light<00:01:30.090> is<00:01:30.740> basically<00:01:31.740> coming

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
remember so my light is basically coming

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.590 
remember so my light is basically coming
in<00:01:32.310> from<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.850> side<00:01:33.090> here<00:01:33.689> now<00:01:35.299> what<00:01:36.299> I've<00:01:36.420> got

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
in from the side here now what I've got

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.219 
in from the side here now what I've got
here<00:01:36.630> are<00:01:37.290> three<00:01:37.770> different<00:01:37.950> markers<00:01:39.229> each

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
here are three different markers each

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.020 
here are three different markers each
one<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.560> them<00:01:40.710> has<00:01:40.770> a<00:01:41.009> different<00:01:41.700> with<00:01:42.060> tip<00:01:44.030> I'm

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
one of them has a different with tip I'm

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.700 
one of them has a different with tip I'm
going<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.329> start<00:01:45.570> out

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.859 

and<00:01:50.520> just<00:01:50.880> kind<00:01:51.060> of<00:01:51.229> black<00:01:53.360> marker<00:01:54.360> this<00:01:54.570> whole

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
and just kind of black marker this whole

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.250 
and just kind of black marker this whole
thing<00:01:55.170> in<00:01:55.490> just<00:01:56.490> kind<00:01:56.640> of<00:01:56.670> universal<00:01:57.260> just

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260 
thing in just kind of universal just

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.149 
thing in just kind of universal just
uniformly<00:02:00.110> just<00:02:01.110> so<00:02:01.200> you<00:02:01.290> can<00:02:01.409> distinguish<00:02:01.950> it

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
uniformly just so you can distinguish it

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.800 
uniformly just so you can distinguish it
from<00:02:02.190> the<00:02:02.490> from<00:02:02.970> the<00:02:03.060> tracer<00:02:03.420> lines<00:02:03.630> a<00:02:03.780> little

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
from the from the tracer lines a little

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.979 
from the from the tracer lines a little
bit<00:02:04.110> better<00:02:07.970> still<00:02:08.970> haven't<00:02:09.360> like<00:02:09.479> varied<00:02:09.869> the

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
bit better still haven't like varied the

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.820 
bit better still haven't like varied the
lines<00:02:10.200> very<00:02:10.500> much<00:02:10.970> but<00:02:11.970> what<00:02:12.569> I'm<00:02:12.660> going<00:02:12.810> to<00:02:12.840> do

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
lines very much but what I'm going to do

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.600 
lines very much but what I'm going to do
now<00:02:14.130> is<00:02:15.020> this<00:02:16.020> bottom<00:02:16.560> edge<00:02:16.770> here<00:02:17.459> would

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
now is this bottom edge here would

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:18.920 
now is this bottom edge here would
basically<00:02:17.790> be<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:18.209> one<00:02:18.330> touching<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.810> ground

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
basically be the one touching the ground

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.320 
basically be the one touching the ground
I'm<00:02:19.680> going<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:19.980> give<00:02:20.160> that<00:02:20.400> one<00:02:20.580> overall<00:02:21.180> the

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
I'm going to give that one overall the

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:30.710 
I'm going to give that one overall the
heaviest<00:02:22.250> line<00:02:29.030> that<00:02:30.030> really<00:02:30.239> just<00:02:30.510> kind<00:02:30.690> of

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
heaviest line that really just kind of

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.990 
heaviest line that really just kind of
takes<00:02:31.019> the<00:02:31.170> takes<00:02:31.739> the<00:02:31.890> object<00:02:32.370> and<00:02:32.550> really

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
takes the takes the object and really

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.180 
takes the takes the object and really
makes<00:02:33.180> it<00:02:33.330> seem<00:02:33.570> like<00:02:34.500> basically<00:02:34.950> like

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
makes it seem like basically like

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.580 
makes it seem like basically like
adhered<00:02:35.820> to<00:02:35.880> the<00:02:36.000> ground<00:02:36.330> like<00:02:36.600> it<00:02:36.720> has<00:02:37.260> a<00:02:37.290> bit

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
adhered to the ground like it has a bit

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.190 
adhered to the ground like it has a bit
of<00:02:37.680> weight<00:02:37.860> to<00:02:38.160> it<00:02:40.940> and<00:02:41.940> then<00:02:42.930> I'm<00:02:43.050> going<00:02:43.170> to

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
of weight to it and then I'm going to

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.000 
of weight to it and then I'm going to
darken<00:02:43.500> these<00:02:44.160> two<00:02:44.550> lines<00:02:44.880> here<00:02:45.660> which<00:02:46.530> are

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
darken these two lines here which are

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.580 
darken these two lines here which are
the<00:02:47.819> ones<00:02:48.060> that<00:02:48.269> are<00:02:48.510> facing<00:02:49.050> away<00:02:49.170> from<00:02:49.350> the

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
the ones that are facing away from the

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.979 
the ones that are facing away from the
light<00:02:49.830> so<00:02:50.130> it<00:02:50.489> would<00:02:50.910> look<00:02:50.940> it<00:02:51.600> looks<00:02:51.810> a<00:02:51.870> little

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
light so it would look it looks a little

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.640 
light so it would look it looks a little
bit<00:02:52.170> more<00:02:52.380> natural<00:02:53.660> for<00:02:54.660> them<00:02:54.780> to<00:02:54.840> be<00:02:55.110> darkened

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
bit more natural for them to be darkened

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.670 
bit more natural for them to be darkened
as<00:02:55.910> well<00:02:56.910> but<00:02:57.660> I'm<00:02:57.780> not<00:02:57.959> going<00:02:58.079> to<00:02:58.140> go<00:02:58.320> quite<00:02:58.650> as

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
as well but I'm not going to go quite as

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.620 
as well but I'm not going to go quite as
thick<00:02:58.829> as<00:02:59.310> I've<00:02:59.489> gone<00:02:59.730> down<00:03:00.120> here<00:03:00.480> on<00:03:00.600> the

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
thick as I've gone down here on the

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:13.440 
thick as I've gone down here on the
bottom<00:03:05.570> take<00:03:06.570> this<00:03:06.690> thinnest<00:03:07.140> marker<00:03:07.530> here

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.350 

over<00:03:14.450> those<00:03:15.250> these<00:03:16.250> are<00:03:16.310> the<00:03:16.700> two<00:03:16.850> lines<00:03:17.090> that

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
over those these are the two lines that

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.490 
over those these are the two lines that
are<00:03:17.510> basically<00:03:17.870> facing<00:03:18.650> the<00:03:18.860> light<00:03:20.500> so

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
are basically facing the light so

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.050 
are basically facing the light so
they're<00:03:21.770> going<00:03:21.920> to<00:03:21.980> be<00:03:22.070> up<00:03:22.370> here<00:03:22.430> a<00:03:22.640> little<00:03:22.850> bit

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
they're going to be up here a little bit

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.110 
they're going to be up here a little bit
more<00:03:23.270> light<00:03:23.600> than<00:03:24.220> these<00:03:25.220> back<00:03:25.520> to<00:03:25.760> and

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
more light than these back to and

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.820 
more light than these back to and
definitely<00:03:26.840> a<00:03:26.930> lot<00:03:27.140> more<00:03:27.200> light<00:03:27.530> than<00:03:27.560> the

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
definitely a lot more light than the

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.740 
definitely a lot more light than the
ones<00:03:28.550> on<00:03:28.730> the<00:03:28.760> bottom<00:03:30.070> and<00:03:31.070> just<00:03:31.750> batten

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
ones on the bottom and just batten

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.830 
ones on the bottom and just batten
everything<00:03:32.810> up<00:03:33.820> this<00:03:34.820> of<00:03:35.030> course<00:03:35.060> is<00:03:35.480> very

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
everything up this of course is very

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.410 
everything up this of course is very
much<00:03:36.760> exaggerated<00:03:38.200> but<00:03:39.200> it's<00:03:39.350> just<00:03:40.330> for<00:03:41.330> the

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
much exaggerated but it's just for the

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.000 
much exaggerated but it's just for the
sake<00:03:41.600> of<00:03:41.630> illustrating<00:03:42.320> a<00:03:42.380> point<00:03:42.410> I'm<00:03:42.860> making

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
sake of illustrating a point I'm making

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.530 
sake of illustrating a point I'm making
these<00:03:43.310> much<00:03:43.670> more<00:03:43.910> heavy<00:03:44.150> than<00:03:44.240> I<00:03:44.480> normally

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
these much more heavy than I normally

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:54.580 
these much more heavy than I normally
would

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.130 

and<00:03:54.680> these<00:03:55.610> three<00:03:55.940> lines<00:03:56.120> on<00:03:56.420> the<00:03:56.540> interior<00:03:56.930> of

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
and these three lines on the interior of

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.119 
and these three lines on the interior of
the<00:03:57.379> cube<00:03:57.910> I'm<00:03:58.910> going<00:03:59.090> to<00:03:59.150> make<00:03:59.300> the<00:03:59.480> faintest

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:00.129 
the cube I'm going to make the faintest

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:04.270 
the cube I'm going to make the faintest
overall<00:04:02.470> so<00:04:03.470> basically<00:04:03.830> I've<00:04:04.010> gone<00:04:04.220> through

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
overall so basically I've gone through

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.960 
overall so basically I've gone through
I've<00:04:05.470> pretty<00:04:06.470> much<00:04:06.560> easily<00:04:06.890> just<00:04:07.280> divided

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
I've pretty much easily just divided

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.170 
I've pretty much easily just divided
this<00:04:08.090> up<00:04:08.269> into<00:04:08.420> four<00:04:08.690> different<00:04:08.870> line<00:04:09.200> weights

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
this up into four different line weights

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.089 
this up into four different line weights
got<00:04:11.180> one<00:04:11.450> your<00:04:11.870> heaviest<00:04:12.260> which<00:04:12.799> is<00:04:12.950> on<00:04:13.069> the

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099 
got one your heaviest which is on the

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:19.420 
got one your heaviest which is on the
bottom<00:04:14.500> two<00:04:16.630> these<00:04:17.630> two<00:04:17.690> here<00:04:18.350> which<00:04:18.889> are<00:04:19.100> the

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
bottom two these two here which are the

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.060 
bottom two these two here which are the
lines<00:04:20.180> that<00:04:20.389> you<00:04:20.780> basically<00:04:21.229> you<00:04:21.650> can't<00:04:21.889> see

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
lines that you basically you can't see

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.920 
lines that you basically you can't see
you<00:04:22.750> that<00:04:23.750> go<00:04:24.320> around<00:04:24.440> the<00:04:24.710> edges<00:04:24.860> and<00:04:25.930> are

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
you that go around the edges and are

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.320 
you that go around the edges and are
facing<00:04:27.350> away<00:04:27.440> from<00:04:27.560> the<00:04:27.770> light<00:04:28.010> the<00:04:28.940> two<00:04:29.150> edge

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
facing away from the light the two edge

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.520 
facing away from the light the two edge
lines<00:04:29.660> here<00:04:30.290> that<00:04:30.440> do<00:04:30.979> face<00:04:31.190> the<00:04:31.430> light<00:04:32.530> would

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
lines here that do face the light would

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.400 
lines here that do face the light would
be<00:04:33.710> three<00:04:34.100> and<00:04:34.750> then<00:04:35.750> the<00:04:35.870> lines<00:04:36.080> on<00:04:36.290> the

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
be three and then the lines on the

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.450 
be three and then the lines on the
interior<00:04:36.740> for<00:04:37.460> the<00:04:37.880> faintest<00:04:38.240> overall<00:04:38.690> and

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
interior for the faintest overall and

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:41.980 
interior for the faintest overall and
that's<00:04:40.460> just<00:04:40.550> a<00:04:40.760> brief<00:04:40.940> lesson<00:04:41.180> on<00:04:41.479> line

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
that's just a brief lesson on line

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.820 
that's just a brief lesson on line
weight<00:04:42.820> thanks
