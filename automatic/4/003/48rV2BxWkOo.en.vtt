00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.080 
put something that catches a little bit
of<00:02:36.290> the<00:02:36.379> eye<00:02:36.410> without<00:02:37.040> impeding<00:02:37.550> a<00:02:37.819> lot<00:02:37.970> of

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
of the eye without impeding a lot of

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.589 
of the eye without impeding a lot of
troop<00:02:38.300> movement<00:02:38.720> as<00:02:39.459> well<00:02:40.459> as<00:02:40.700> boards<00:02:41.180> that

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:41.599 
troop movement as well as boards that

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:44.559 
troop movement as well as boards that
have<00:02:41.660> no<00:02:42.290> rocks<00:02:42.950> on<00:02:43.280> them<00:02:43.519> to<00:02:44.060> allow<00:02:44.269> you<00:02:44.330> to

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
have no rocks on them to allow you to

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:46.360 
have no rocks on them to allow you to
put<00:02:44.690> the<00:02:44.840> buttes<00:02:45.110> on<00:02:45.290> them<00:02:45.500> very<00:02:45.709> easily<00:02:45.800> so

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
put the buttes on them very easily so

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.390 
put the buttes on them very easily so
that<00:02:46.970> you<00:02:47.180> can<00:02:47.480> get<00:02:47.930> a<00:02:47.959> nice<00:02:48.140> flush<00:02:48.590> fit<00:02:48.920> so

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
that you can get a nice flush fit so

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.089 
that you can get a nice flush fit so
that<00:02:49.430> they<00:02:50.120> give<00:02:51.080> a<00:02:51.110> nice<00:02:51.349> impression<00:02:51.739> of

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:52.099 
that they give a nice impression of

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:55.479 
that they give a nice impression of
having<00:02:52.250> unity<00:02:52.730> with<00:02:52.880> the<00:02:52.910> board<00:02:53.209> base<00:02:54.489> the

having unity with the board base the

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.400 
having unity with the board base the
second<00:02:55.849> feature<00:02:55.989> other<00:02:56.989> I<00:02:57.019> wanted<00:02:57.230> to<00:02:57.290> point

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
second feature other I wanted to point

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.080 
second feature other I wanted to point
out<00:02:57.560> is<00:02:57.709> the<00:02:57.860> Oasis<00:02:58.720> the<00:02:59.720> Oasis<00:03:00.500> is<00:03:01.000> now<00:03:02.000> of

out is the Oasis the Oasis is now of

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.520 
out is the Oasis the Oasis is now of
course<00:03:02.269> they'll<00:03:02.510> be<00:03:02.569> cut<00:03:02.840> individually<00:03:03.080> every

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
course they'll be cut individually every

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.229 
course they'll be cut individually every

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
time I make this board but just to give

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:07.120 
time I make this board but just to give
you<00:03:05.390> an<00:03:05.510> idea<00:03:05.630> this<00:03:05.959> one<00:03:06.170> is<00:03:06.290> just<00:03:06.560> about<00:03:06.769> 12

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
you an idea this one is just about 12

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.020 
you an idea this one is just about 12
inches<00:03:07.280> across<00:03:07.640> and<00:03:08.260> about<00:03:09.260> 5<00:03:10.099> inches<00:03:10.130> wide<00:03:10.730> or

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
inches across and about 5 inches wide or

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.300 
inches across and about 5 inches wide or
so<00:03:11.209> and<00:03:11.480> features<00:03:12.349> a<00:03:12.380> variety<00:03:12.620> of<00:03:12.920> scrub

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
so and features a variety of scrub

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.940 
so and features a variety of scrub
vegetation<00:03:13.430> around<00:03:14.030> it<00:03:14.360> I<00:03:14.480> figured<00:03:14.950> near

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
vegetation around it I figured near

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.180 
vegetation around it I figured near
water<00:03:16.340> vegetation<00:03:17.030> would<00:03:17.299> be<00:03:17.420> slightly<00:03:17.750> more

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
water vegetation would be slightly more

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.470 
water vegetation would be slightly more
prominent<00:03:19.190> and<00:03:19.340> one<00:03:20.000> of<00:03:20.030> the<00:03:20.180> things<00:03:20.390> that

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
prominent and one of the things that

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.210 
prominent and one of the things that
I've<00:03:20.660> used<00:03:20.870> on<00:03:21.110> this<00:03:21.260> set<00:03:21.530> and<00:03:21.560> will<00:03:21.860> use<00:03:22.069> in

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
I've used on this set and will use in

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.539 
I've used on this set and will use in
the<00:03:22.310> future<00:03:22.459> are<00:03:23.120> these<00:03:23.269> sill<00:03:23.630> floor<00:03:24.340> Tufts<00:03:25.340> of

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
the future are these sill floor Tufts of

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:27.370 
the future are these sill floor Tufts of
grass<00:03:25.610> that<00:03:25.849> are<00:03:26.299> made<00:03:26.480> by<00:03:26.660> scenic<00:03:26.989> express

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
grass that are made by scenic express

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.199 
grass that are made by scenic express
these<00:03:27.799> are<00:03:27.980> really<00:03:28.190> nice<00:03:28.489> and<00:03:28.790> I<00:03:28.910> think<00:03:29.120> they

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
these are really nice and I think they

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.509 
these are really nice and I think they
give<00:03:29.360> a<00:03:29.390> really<00:03:29.660> nice<00:03:29.840> feel<00:03:30.200> for<00:03:30.440> the<00:03:30.530> board<00:03:30.769> as

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
give a really nice feel for the board as

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:34.900 
give a really nice feel for the board as
sort<00:03:31.790> of<00:03:31.880> like<00:03:32.060> scrubby<00:03:33.220> you<00:03:34.220> know<00:03:34.340> desert<00:03:34.849> e

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
sort of like scrubby you know desert e

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.449 
sort of like scrubby you know desert e
vegetation<00:03:35.599> trying<00:03:35.959> to<00:03:36.319> grab<00:03:36.650> a<00:03:36.680> foothold<00:03:37.069> in

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
vegetation trying to grab a foothold in

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.080 
vegetation trying to grab a foothold in
an<00:03:37.549> otherwise<00:03:37.850> hostile<00:03:38.450> environment<00:03:39.130> so<00:03:40.130> the

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
an otherwise hostile environment so the

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.289 
an otherwise hostile environment so the
watercolor<00:03:41.989> was<00:03:42.440> originally<00:03:43.430> designed<00:03:43.670> based

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
watercolor was originally designed based

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:46.059 
watercolor was originally designed based
on<00:03:44.540> communication<00:03:44.989> with<00:03:45.380> a<00:03:45.410> customer<00:03:45.859> that

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:46.069 
on communication with a customer that

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:48.190 
on communication with a customer that
was<00:03:46.310> requesting<00:03:46.880> the<00:03:46.970> set<00:03:47.209> and<00:03:47.450> he<00:03:47.930> wanted

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
was requesting the set and he wanted

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.199 
was requesting the set and he wanted
something<00:03:48.410> in<00:03:48.650> the<00:03:48.739> gray<00:03:49.040> green<00:03:49.549> kind<00:03:50.060> of

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
something in the gray green kind of

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:53.289 
something in the gray green kind of
color<00:03:50.450> theme<00:03:50.720> so<00:03:50.959> this<00:03:51.109> is<00:03:51.200> a<00:03:51.230> very<00:03:51.380> dark<00:03:52.299> murky

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299 
color theme so this is a very dark murky

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:55.479 
color theme so this is a very dark murky
green<00:03:53.510> with<00:03:54.139> a<00:03:54.170> little<00:03:54.440> bit<00:03:54.560> of<00:03:54.590> gray<00:03:54.859> cut<00:03:55.190> into

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
green with a little bit of gray cut into

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:57.640 
green with a little bit of gray cut into
it<00:03:55.609> and<00:03:55.760> then<00:03:56.510> this<00:03:56.690> matches<00:03:57.049> the<00:03:57.170> river<00:03:57.380> which

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
it and then this matches the river which

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.349 
it and then this matches the river which
I'll<00:03:57.769> show<00:03:57.920> you<00:03:57.950> next<00:03:59.650> the<00:04:00.819> set<00:04:01.819> I<00:04:02.030> thought

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:02.359 
I'll show you next the set I thought

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:04.780 
I'll show you next the set I thought
needed<00:04:02.750> a<00:04:03.400> little<00:04:04.400> bit<00:04:04.579> of<00:04:04.670> a<00:04:04.760> different

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
needed a little bit of a different

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.430 
needed a little bit of a different
flavor<00:04:05.359> for<00:04:05.660> the<00:04:05.720> river<00:04:05.930> than<00:04:06.139> what<00:04:06.260> I've<00:04:06.350> been

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
flavor for the river than what I've been

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.259 
flavor for the river than what I've been
previously<00:04:06.889> doing<00:04:07.280> to<00:04:07.400> distinguish<00:04:07.940> it<00:04:08.120> and

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:08.269 
previously doing to distinguish it and

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:10.390 
previously doing to distinguish it and
give<00:04:08.420> some<00:04:08.600> variation<00:04:09.139> so<00:04:09.769> this<00:04:09.920> river<00:04:10.160> is

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
give some variation so this river is

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.470 
give some variation so this river is
considerably<00:04:11.389> wider<00:04:11.720> it<00:04:12.170> varies<00:04:12.560> from<00:04:12.859> about

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
considerably wider it varies from about

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.810 
considerably wider it varies from about
let's<00:04:14.480> see<00:04:14.720> here<00:04:14.959> I<00:04:14.989> think<00:04:15.109> about<00:04:15.319> two<00:04:16.099> inches

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820 
let's see here I think about two inches

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:19.930 
let's see here I think about two inches
at<00:04:17.090> a<00:04:17.150> very<00:04:17.510> narrow<00:04:17.810> point<00:04:18.200> to<00:04:18.919> the<00:04:19.760> more

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
at a very narrow point to the more

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.690 
at a very narrow point to the more
common<00:04:20.450> see<00:04:21.320> three<00:04:21.620> inches<00:04:21.979> or<00:04:22.130> so<00:04:22.310> and<00:04:22.520> that's

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
common see three inches or so and that's

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.089 
common see three inches or so and that's
just<00:04:22.849> the<00:04:23.030> actual<00:04:23.360> water<00:04:23.570> the<00:04:24.139> gap<00:04:24.349> itself<00:04:24.889> is

00:04:25.089 --> 00:04:25.099 
just the actual water the gap itself is

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:26.830 
just the actual water the gap itself is
over<00:04:25.370> four<00:04:25.639> inches<00:04:25.789> across<00:04:26.150> in<00:04:26.479> most<00:04:26.660> areas

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
over four inches across in most areas

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.930 
over four inches across in most areas
and<00:04:27.229> some<00:04:27.410> areas<00:04:27.740> the<00:04:28.160> gap<00:04:28.340> is<00:04:28.550> up<00:04:28.669> to<00:04:28.820> as<00:04:28.910> much

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
and some areas the gap is up to as much

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.589

00:05:37.559 --> 00:05:37.569 
new set is a mine opening so what I did

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:39.959 
new set is a mine opening so what I did
is<00:05:37.719> this<00:05:38.409> is<00:05:38.529> a<00:05:38.559> corner<00:05:39.009> piece<00:05:39.189> it<00:05:39.610> will<00:05:39.789> always

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:42.429 
be placed in the corner so it's a just

00:05:42.429 --> 00:05:44.969 
be placed in the corner so it's a just

wooden fronted corner opening to
entrance<00:05:49.119> to<00:05:49.299> a<00:05:49.329> mine<00:05:49.509> it<00:05:49.989> gives<00:05:50.169> something<00:05:50.379> a

00:05:50.519 --> 00:05:50.529 
entrance to a mine it gives something a

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:51.629 
entrance to a mine it gives something a
little<00:05:50.679> bit<00:05:50.860> different<00:05:51.159> in<00:05:51.249> the<00:05:51.339> corner

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:51.639 
little bit different in the corner

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:55.339 
little bit different in the corner
visually<00:05:52.209> strategic<00:05:53.019> objective<00:05:53.559> perhaps<00:05:54.039> and

00:05:55.339 --> 00:05:55.349 
visually strategic objective perhaps and

00:05:55.349 --> 00:05:57.839 
visually strategic objective perhaps and
was<00:05:56.349> kind<00:05:56.649> of<00:05:56.679> a<00:05:56.769> nice<00:05:57.159> variation<00:05:57.519> but

00:05:57.839 --> 00:05:57.849 
was kind of a nice variation but

00:05:57.849 --> 00:05:59.309 
was kind of a nice variation but
features<00:05:58.179> the<00:05:58.329> same<00:05:58.569> weathering<00:05:59.049> as<00:05:59.169> the

00:05:59.309 --> 00:05:59.319 
features the same weathering as the

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:02.039 
features the same weathering as the
buttes<00:05:59.589> and<00:06:00.269> eroded<00:06:01.269> had<00:06:01.479> to<00:06:01.689> match<00:06:01.839> the

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:02.049 
buttes and eroded had to match the

00:06:02.049 --> 00:06:06.749 
buttes and eroded had to match the
rivers<00:06:02.319> as<00:06:02.439> well<00:06:03.749> so<00:06:05.069> this<00:06:06.069> set<00:06:06.399> would<00:06:06.610> be

00:06:06.749 --> 00:06:06.759 
rivers as well so this set would be

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:09.389 
rivers as well so this set would be
