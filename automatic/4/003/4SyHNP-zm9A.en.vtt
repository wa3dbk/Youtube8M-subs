00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 hello medina okay good today came to do 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.290
 for you a very quick tip is just 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.580
 to show you how I do to 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.099
 pass red lipstick when a 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.679
 a little longer because when 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.000
 hastened the normal mode even though 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.550
 this is a tip to leave the mouth a 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.320
 a little bigger a little prettier 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.359
 with a red lipstick so if you 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.090
 You want to know how I made that mouth? 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:27.720
 health on the aces pin than the first then 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.859
 I'll get a pencil out of bounds. 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.130
 lipstick, right? 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:34.140
 and I'll go the one that is the way of the conversation 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.190
 I already showed you in the shopping video. 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.230
 the panvel 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.219
 I love watching well that half of them 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.850
 for badin so now I'll tell you 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.379
 mouth does not pay is the advantageous price a 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.890
 time I saw the difference of the 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.890
 control 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.879
 so basically this 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:08.790
 else do not make the outline like this. 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.820
 on the outside and with tori here he has to 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.950
 die into the mouth contour're 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.950
 two years of low education 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:28.650
 Okay, now I'll get a lipstick and aquila 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.610
 apothecary this red here is an email 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.970
 marketing 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.280
 I'll get the billzinho at our pixels 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.880
 in the midst of the great team I met who 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.229
 take a moment to spend there people 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.759
 said he did not need to discuss 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.810
 details but I will use to pass 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.910
 lipstick 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.430
 which is wrong because when you use the 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:50.580
 brush for button and it does not get mean 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.440
 grease knows but as is the case with 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.330
 spies the world has just left the 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:58.290
 platoon 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:02:00.780
 there I fill up on that 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.649
 outline is because the intention is not 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.649
 show the outline 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:11.280
 so I do not see boundary teaching 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:14.090
 whole street I speak more difficult 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.090
 do 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.480
 It soon turned out so it does not have to be well. 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.150
 right first because we're going 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.100
 We'll do more to fix the things we do there. 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.910
 I'll get a brush with the fan on your 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.680
 avon lipstick that's it here I woke up 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.590
 red lipstick color already showed to 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.560
 You are 330 games and in others for you 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.540
 Avon color is sexy 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:46.250
 I do not know if you're going to focus because it's mine. 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:49.640
 neighbor of clean sexual is a first 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.740
 well closed what I 'm going to do I would not get 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:56.210
 at its lowest zig zig of pain is then that 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:59.560
 This is just the dark red pegasus and I'm going 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:59.560
 spend only in the corner here 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.930
 OK 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.160
 the other 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:31.150
 The ideal is that lipstick facebook more 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:34.870
 dark is to give more differences than you are 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:36.670
 giving you know what is a little different from 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.930
 Time that you gave more and you in here. 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:42.700
 also 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:46.050
 Only in the center of the mouth and inside. 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.050
 here silva 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:55.180
 Only then are you able to see where 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:59.730
 it was dark I do not know if I can see 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:06.580
 because being faithful 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:14.640
 Then I'll get a sparkling lipstick from 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:14.640
 mary kay the color of it is with pear to be 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.690
 use it has to be an average constant 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.310
 In this case the rest I've done is 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:25.030

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:51.830
 then summarizing got this , ok this 

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:53.479
 was the red lipstick mouth is I do 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.159
 that's when I have more time like this 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:57.860
 which takes a little longer than 

00:04:55.159 --> 00:05:00.349
 are taken to the lipstick is cooler is that 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.990

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:04.789
