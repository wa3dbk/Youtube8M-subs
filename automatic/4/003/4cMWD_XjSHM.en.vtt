is<00:01:24.899> known<00:01:25.080> as<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.590> decoction<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.880> decoction

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
is known as a decoction and a decoction

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.639 
is known as a decoction and a decoction
simply<00:01:27.660> means<00:01:27.899> we're<00:01:28.110> going<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.320> boil<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.500> down

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:28.649 
simply means we're going to boil it down

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:31.639 
simply means we're going to boil it down
to<00:01:28.890> about<00:01:29.160> half<00:01:29.640> it's<00:01:30.030> half<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:30.959> whatever<00:01:31.350> it

to about half it's half of whatever it
is<00:01:31.860> to<00:01:32.039> begin<00:01:32.190> with<00:01:32.520> so<00:01:32.940> I<00:01:33.209> add<00:01:33.479> three<00:01:33.959> three

simmer for about ten minutes and you
have<00:01:45.450> your<00:01:45.630> decoction

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.250 

so<00:01:55.190> on<00:01:55.490> the<00:01:55.640> right<00:01:55.820> is<00:01:56.060> our<00:01:56.300> decoction<00:01:56.690> and<00:01:57.110> on

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.260 
so on the right is our decoction and on

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.410 
so on the right is our decoction and on
the<00:01:57.560> left<00:01:57.920> is<00:01:58.100> what<00:01:58.280> we<00:01:58.430> began<00:01:58.700> with<00:01:58.909> at<00:01:59.120> three

the left is what we began with at three
cups<00:01:59.690> of<00:01:59.840> water<00:01:59.900> I<00:02:00.530> filtered<00:02:01.250> this<00:02:01.430> out<00:02:01.670> and<00:02:01.940> it

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.090 
bunch of rose petals because I was
curious<00:02:14.480> to<00:02:14.600> see<00:02:14.780> if<00:02:15.110> the<00:02:15.350> rose<00:02:15.530> petals<00:02:15.920> would

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
curious to see if the rose petals would

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.160 
curious to see if the rose petals would
infuse<00:02:16.520> their<00:02:16.760> fragrance<00:02:17.270> into<00:02:17.840> the<00:02:17.930> mix

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
infuse their fragrance into the mix

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.720 
infuse their fragrance into the mix
which<00:02:18.440> would<00:02:18.590> then<00:02:18.800> eliminate<00:02:19.400> the<00:02:19.550> need<00:02:19.670> for

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
which would then eliminate the need for

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.610 
which would then eliminate the need for
me<00:02:19.970> to<00:02:20.000> go<00:02:20.270> back<00:02:20.450> with<00:02:20.600> an<00:02:20.750> essential<00:02:21.050> oil<00:02:21.380> to

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
me to go back with an essential oil to

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.650 
me to go back with an essential oil to
add<00:02:21.830> a<00:02:21.860> fragrance<00:02:22.520> and<00:02:22.670> they<00:02:23.090> did<00:02:23.390> but<00:02:23.600> the

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
add a fragrance and they did but the

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.780 
add a fragrance and they did but the
only<00:02:23.840> drawback<00:02:24.290> is<00:02:24.470> it<00:02:24.890> made<00:02:25.130> it<00:02:25.310> a<00:02:25.400> little<00:02:25.580> bit

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
only drawback is it made it a little bit

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.580 
only drawback is it made it a little bit
darker<00:02:26.030> than<00:02:26.239> I<00:02:26.450> would<00:02:26.600> have<00:02:26.630> liked<00:02:26.959> so<00:02:27.440> as

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
darker than I would have liked so as

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.070 
darker than I would have liked so as
that<00:02:27.800> cally<00:02:28.100> I<00:02:28.160> don't<00:02:28.370> really<00:02:28.640> like<00:02:28.820> it<00:02:29.000> but

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
that cally I don't really like it but

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.300 
that cally I don't really like it but
functionality<00:02:30.080> of<00:02:30.170> it<00:02:30.290> is<00:02:30.500> so<00:02:30.800> great<00:02:31.100> I'm

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
functionality of it is so great I'm

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.310 
functionality of it is so great I'm
willing<00:02:31.670> to<00:02:31.910> just<00:02:32.120> keep<00:02:32.420> it<00:02:32.540> that<00:02:32.570> way<00:02:32.720> and<00:02:33.110> we

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
willing to just keep it that way and we

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.050 
willing to just keep it that way and we
can<00:02:33.470> always<00:02:33.680> change<00:02:34.100> how<00:02:34.430> it<00:02:34.610> looks<00:02:34.880> at<00:02:35.030> a

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
can always change how it looks at a

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.810 
can always change how it looks at a
later<00:02:35.300> point<00:02:35.600> then<00:02:36.170> I<00:02:36.410> added<00:02:36.800> a<00:02:37.130> cup<00:02:37.430> of<00:02:37.610> aloe

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
later point then I added a cup of aloe

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.030 
later point then I added a cup of aloe
vera<00:02:37.940> juice<00:02:38.330> to<00:02:38.540> balance<00:02:38.930> the<00:02:39.080> pH<00:02:39.230> as<00:02:39.650> well<00:02:39.860> as

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
vera juice to balance the pH as well as

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.040 
vera juice to balance the pH as well as
increase<00:02:40.459> the<00:02:40.610> moisturizing<00:02:41.300> abilities<00:02:41.840> and

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
increase the moisturizing abilities and

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.600 
increase the moisturizing abilities and
this<00:02:42.530> is<00:02:42.680> one<00:02:42.830> of<00:02:42.860> my<00:02:43.070> favorite<00:02:43.459> ingredients

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
this is one of my favorite ingredients

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.060 
this is one of my favorite ingredients
shea<00:02:44.269> butter<00:02:44.540> water<00:02:44.840> soluble<00:02:45.410> and<00:02:45.620> we'll<00:02:45.830> talk

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
shea butter water soluble and we'll talk

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:47.290 
shea butter water soluble and we'll talk
about<00:02:46.190> this<00:02:46.430> at<00:02:46.610> a<00:02:46.640> later<00:02:46.820> video<00:02:47.180> but

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
about this at a later video but

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.570 
about this at a later video but
basically<00:02:47.720> it's<00:02:48.590> shea<00:02:49.130> butter<00:02:49.340> that

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
basically it's shea butter that

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.430 
basically it's shea butter that
dissolves<00:02:50.000> in<00:02:50.060> water<00:02:50.120> which<00:02:50.690> eliminates<00:02:51.260> the

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
dissolves in water which eliminates the

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.410 
dissolves in water which eliminates the
need<00:02:51.590> to<00:02:51.650> have<00:02:51.920> an<00:02:52.070> emulsifier<00:02:52.730> when<00:02:53.030> making

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
need to have an emulsifier when making

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.810 
need to have an emulsifier when making
these<00:02:53.570> mixes<00:02:54.080> and<00:02:54.260> finally<00:02:55.160> very<00:02:55.519> very

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
these mixes and finally very very

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.120 
these mixes and finally very very
important<00:02:56.420> is<00:02:56.630> a<00:02:56.690> preservative<00:02:57.380> and<00:02:57.739> using

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
important is a preservative and using

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.130 
important is a preservative and using
liquid<00:02:58.459> gamma<00:02:58.700> plus<00:02:59.060> and<00:02:59.390> you<00:02:59.720> want<00:02:59.930> to<00:03:00.019> use<00:03:00.110> a

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
liquid gamma plus and you want to use a

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.930 
liquid gamma plus and you want to use a
preservative<00:03:00.620> especially<00:03:01.340> in<00:03:01.430> this<00:03:01.579> water

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
preservative especially in this water

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.090 
preservative especially in this water
heavy<00:03:02.269> formulations<00:03:02.959> because<00:03:03.140> the<00:03:03.709> chances

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
heavy formulations because the chances

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.130 
heavy formulations because the chances
of<00:03:04.220> having<00:03:04.340> pathogens<00:03:05.000> in<00:03:05.180> them<00:03:05.450> are<00:03:05.630> really

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
of having pathogens in them are really

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.640 
of having pathogens in them are really
high<00:03:06.560> so<00:03:07.220> in<00:03:07.489> the<00:03:07.610> end<00:03:07.820> I<00:03:08.180> had<00:03:08.570> about<00:03:08.989> two<00:03:09.380> cups

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
high so in the end I had about two cups

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.470 
high so in the end I had about two cups
of<00:03:09.860> this<00:03:10.040> mix<00:03:10.400> and<00:03:10.579> I<00:03:10.850> put<00:03:11.060> one<00:03:11.239> in<00:03:11.390> an

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
of this mix and I put one in an

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.569 
of this mix and I put one in an
optimizer<00:03:11.989> which<00:03:12.230> releases<00:03:12.769> less<00:03:13.010> water<00:03:13.340> and

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:13.579 
optimizer which releases less water and

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:15.759 
optimizer which releases less water and
the<00:03:13.970> other<00:03:14.000> one<00:03:14.239> in<00:03:14.329> a<00:03:14.420> spritz<00:03:14.780> bottle<00:03:15.049> and<00:03:15.410> as

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
the other one in a spritz bottle and as

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:17.979 
the other one in a spritz bottle and as
you<00:03:15.860> can<00:03:16.010> see<00:03:16.220> it's<00:03:16.489> not<00:03:16.640> too<00:03:16.880> mucus<00:03:17.299> heavy<00:03:17.630> and

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
you can see it's not too mucus heavy and

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.319 
you can see it's not too mucus heavy and
it's<00:03:18.560> not<00:03:18.769> too<00:03:19.070> thick<00:03:19.370> so<00:03:19.400> it's<00:03:19.730> really<00:03:20.030> light

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.329 
it's not too thick so it's really light

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:22.090 
it's not too thick so it's really light
and<00:03:20.570> I<00:03:20.900> use<00:03:21.049> this<00:03:21.200> in<00:03:21.350> the<00:03:21.440> morning<00:03:21.769> at<00:03:21.890> night

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
and I use this in the morning at night

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.460 
and I use this in the morning at night
before<00:03:22.370> moisturizing<00:03:23.209> whenever<00:03:23.780> really<00:03:24.170> and

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
before moisturizing whenever really and

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.140 
before moisturizing whenever really and
