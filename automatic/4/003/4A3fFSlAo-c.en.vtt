00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 the nuclear energy you asked yourself how 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.330
 works today our junior friend we 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.700
 will help you understand it a little better 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.010
 everything starts the containment building one 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.719
 normal concrete double wall this is 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.599
 the only civil structure designed to 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.190
 withstand the impact of a 747 inside the 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.439
 containment building we will find the 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.380
 reactor in blue where we will introduce the 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.750
 nuclear fuel tiny pills 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.779
 of the size in filter the cigar of 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.580
 uranium 235 g monkeys in how the 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.920
 energy the nucleus of the uranium atom 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.559
 is composed of neutrons in blue and 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.870
 protons in red if we bomb a 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.640
 nucleus with a neutron and impact produces 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.829
 the separation into two parts in addition 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.500
 release new neutrons which in turn 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.050
 will serve to release new energy if 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.880
 multiply the effect we will have a 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.620
 chain reaction 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.960
 to control the progress of the reaction 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.340
 we have the control rods these 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.010
 they make a material with great 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.080
 ability to absorb neutrons for this 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.600
 device we can even get to 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.310
 stop the reaction the energy released in 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.610
 the reaction is used to generate 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.840
 very high temperature steam and prison 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.570
 later by means of a pump it 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.160
 returns the transformed water to the rectum 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.620
 in steam comes out of the containment building 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.990
 until you reach a turbine which makes 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.729
 turn at that moment part of the energy 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.460
 heat to steam is transformed into 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.750
 kinetic energy the turbine will be 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.090
 connected to an electric general 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.750
 by which we will convert such 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.460
 kinetic energy in electrical energy the 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.350
 steam that leaves the turbine still to 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.390
 high temperature and pressure is brought to a 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.280
 condenser where you will get in touch 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.380
 with cold water from the sea or from 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.300
 some new nearby is then produced 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.580
 heat exchange water 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.410
 returns to the lake at a higher temperature and 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.240
 steam from the turbine condenses in 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.340
 yiqing finally the liquid the 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.440
 capacitor will return to the camera 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.360
 main the main advantages of 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.490
 a nuclear power plant are the following 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.640
 on the one hand the low cost 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.799
 On the other hand, we avoid CO2 emissions 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.619
 as inconveniences we will see the waste 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.100
 and above all the radiation and risk of 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.100
 explosion
