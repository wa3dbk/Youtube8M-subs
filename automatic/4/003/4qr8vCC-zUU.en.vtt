00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:18.310
 and you make mobile units too 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.830
 30 here we have a mobile unit 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.320
 satellite transmission cause demand 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.180
 reports 1.6-meter antenna is a 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.610
 satellite hiding system 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.410
 antennae auto city council means 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.880
 that you tell him the tip is the 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:32.619
 satellite and she alone do 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.780
 exactly from the control we 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.129
 we started there's no data from the 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.110
 satellite position to which it goes to 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:40.270
 point at all your connectors very 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.130
 pretty this sports activity highlights 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.520
 the patching is done in the workshop 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:47.410
 of screen printing we are this east of this 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.060
 mode or we make them recorded some 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.450
 many interest are recorded because 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:54.730
 They are permanent and so that nobody walks 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.500
 moving things exactly and in being 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:00.010
 gassed out 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.989
 way very treated and valued a lot but 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.809
 it does not save that lightning can not eliminate 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.880
 in the identification of the entrance of the 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.890
 connector that we were referring to as 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.870
 for how many cameras are videos 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.119
 family for four cameras a cable 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.860
 coaxial I decided for four cameras 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:17.340
 mainly of the finishes that 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:21.960
 can you see in the elephant unit 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.960
 we have a work system 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.329
 so that it was 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.430
 so here it goes straight to the satellite and 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.960
 if we get that we have we want 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.760
 we have the whole transmission part 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.400
 satellite as of what is the in fuck 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.770
 the receiver modulator the control of 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.050
 the antenna monitoring equipment 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.210
 satelite 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.780
 in format for digital signals two 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.880
 conversion types 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.810
 see the digital home and sitalá no 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.420
 we have things for we have 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.970
 in relation to patch aspects the 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.909
 125 kilos power amplifier 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:02.360
 for here we have the energy system 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:04.640
 of 'breaks' multiview team with 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.920
 small widget that have three 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.310
 basic functions senator of characters 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:13.940
 widget and the small storage 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.980
 memory of 252 we have what is the 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.780
 super is that the backups are in case 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.810
 let the main energy go 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.090
 Talk stopped ups are those of 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.400
 up here for this one to continue giving 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.500
 Cod feed looks a little 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.690
 recorder and player to where we can 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.130
 insert the material already edited and what 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.750
 we can allow 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.489
 via satellite through which the 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.250
 playback system console 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:40.070
 yamaha audio 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.990
 six very very practical penalties and it is 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.610
 digital this console three operators are 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.440
 the operators the operators and a 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.060
 plasman there in the back we have 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.290
 a rotating seat that is a mechanism 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.450
 elaborated in the workshop allows me 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.450
 as today there is room to play the 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.670
 unit from the time the finish of the 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.439
 installation of lighting all done 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:03.489
 because I have broken him from his goalkeeper to 

00:02:59.439 --> 00:03:05.500
 fear designed with some designed all 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:08.049
 the high quality and we take care of the details 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.000
 minimums like lighting in the part 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:11.230
 lower of the racc for when the 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.200
 ingenios have making some changes 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.180
 or 72 because they have that accessibility in the 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.810
 back side 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.810
 we have a plant 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.980
 of energy senses kilowats the system 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.570
 of stabilization data control 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.250
 that are on the bottom of the 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.320
 vehicle down here and keeps stable 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.940
 the vehicle to earn from the keep your 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.390
 points while the satellite is 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.360
 cats 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.340
 the detachment and here this place 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.680
 fully automated with manuals 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.690
 may be we already have plants and seven 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.000
 kilos vázquez part of the soul of the 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.190
 unit when we do not have food in 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.230
 the remote location points we have the 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:51.260
 part of the wiring that is also part 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:54.460
 of the workshop made the wiring 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.680
 very organized 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:59.200
 all materials well taken care of here 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.030
 a space to put five suitcases 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.060
 They were to be working some suitcases 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.430
 here if it is camera these cameras 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:07.690
 likins are true horses of 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.060
 battle these mobile units 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.550
 just walk everywhere so it is 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.080
 battle scenes very well you 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.000
 can be a mobile number unit 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.160
 of cameras that he wants or does not want the 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.530
 client that requires it in this 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:29.250
 case is good there was the price of the 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:29.250
 needs thank you very much 

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:32.459
 one
