dance here I'm hoping to God I don't get
this<00:06:15.900> pair<00:06:16.169> of<00:06:16.259> fusion<00:06:16.680> which<00:06:17.039> I<00:06:17.400> was<00:06:18.000> actually

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:18.150 
this pair of fusion which I was actually

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.209 
this pair of fusion which I was actually
kind<00:06:18.509> of<00:06:18.539> surprised<00:06:19.020> that<00:06:19.199> I<00:06:19.319> broke<00:06:19.919> through

00:06:20.209 --> 00:06:20.219 
kind of surprised that I broke through

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:23.209 
kind of surprised that I broke through
it<00:06:20.339> but<00:06:20.610> I<00:06:20.969> yeah<00:06:21.270> that<00:06:21.419> works<00:06:21.719> for<00:06:21.839> me<00:06:21.990> but<00:06:22.259> here

00:06:23.209 --> 00:06:23.219 
it but I yeah that works for me but here

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:25.519 
it but I yeah that works for me but here
because<00:06:23.490> I<00:06:23.520> don't<00:06:24.029> want<00:06:24.150> to<00:06:24.750> take<00:06:25.349> another

00:06:25.519 --> 00:06:25.529 
because I don't want to take another

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:27.679 
because I don't want to take another
risk<00:06:26.069> of<00:06:26.310> that<00:06:26.430> pair<00:06:26.610> of<00:06:26.669> fusion<00:06:27.000> I<00:06:27.150> switch<00:06:27.479> out

00:06:27.679 --> 00:06:27.689 
risk of that pair of fusion I switch out

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:31.730 
risk of that pair of fusion I switch out
to<00:06:27.900> my<00:06:28.020> pixie<00:06:29.330> and<00:06:30.330> I<00:06:30.779> was<00:06:30.899> figuring<00:06:31.289> maybe<00:06:31.500> if

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:31.740 
to my pixie and I was figuring maybe if

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.290 
to my pixie and I was figuring maybe if
you<00:06:31.830> woke<00:06:32.009> up<00:06:32.159> if<00:06:32.490> he<00:06:32.520> had<00:06:32.669> sleep<00:06:33.120> powder

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:33.300 
you woke up if he had sleep powder

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.149 
you woke up if he had sleep powder
that's<00:06:33.599> what<00:06:33.779> he'd<00:06:33.899> go<00:06:34.050> for<00:06:34.080> but<00:06:34.709> anyway<00:06:35.130> I

00:06:35.149 --> 00:06:35.159 
that's what he'd go for but anyway I

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:35.570 
that's what he'd go for but anyway I
went

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:35.580 
went

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.010 
went
right<00:06:35.819> here<00:06:36.030> the<00:06:36.180> lychee<00:06:36.569> just<00:06:36.840> because<00:06:36.990> I

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:37.020 
right here the lychee just because I

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:38.659 
right here the lychee just because I
have<00:06:37.379> to<00:06:37.590> get<00:06:37.770> something<00:06:38.009> getting<00:06:38.490> some

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:38.669 
have to get something getting some

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:41.360 
have to get something getting some
residual<00:06:39.150> damage<00:06:39.360> on<00:06:39.810> this<00:06:40.199> guy<00:06:40.409> I<00:06:40.770> go<00:06:41.159> for<00:06:41.310> the

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:41.370 
residual damage on this guy I go for the

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.939 
residual damage on this guy I go for the
u-turn<00:06:41.729> here<00:06:42.120> again<00:06:42.689> hoping<00:06:43.139> that<00:06:43.319> maybe<00:06:43.590> he

00:06:43.939 --> 00:06:43.949 
u-turn here again hoping that maybe he

00:06:43.949 --> 00:06:45.920 
u-turn here again hoping that maybe he
had<00:06:44.370> the<00:06:44.490> sleep<00:06:44.759> powder<00:06:44.939> he'd<00:06:45.210> go<00:06:45.419> for<00:06:45.449> it<00:06:45.840> and

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:45.930 
had the sleep powder he'd go for it and

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:47.899 
had the sleep powder he'd go for it and
then<00:06:46.409> I'd<00:06:46.530> be<00:06:46.710> my<00:06:46.889> leak<00:06:47.159> hacks<00:06:47.400> which<00:06:47.699> already

00:06:47.899 --> 00:06:47.909 
then I'd be my leak hacks which already

00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:49.490 
then I'd be my leak hacks which already
has<00:06:48.210> a<00:06:48.240> status<00:06:48.599> and<00:06:48.930> he<00:06:48.990> couldn't<00:06:49.199> put<00:06:49.349> me

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:49.500 
has a status and he couldn't put me

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.730 
has a status and he couldn't put me
asleep<00:06:49.710> but<00:06:50.039> no<00:06:50.310> he<00:06:50.759> went<00:06:50.849> for<00:06:51.030> the<00:06:51.090> bug<00:06:51.330> buzz

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:51.740 
asleep but no he went for the bug buzz

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:55.279 
asleep but no he went for the bug buzz
but<00:06:52.740> that's<00:06:52.889> okay<00:06:53.189> because<00:06:53.599> after<00:06:54.599> Lee<00:06:55.020> cheat

00:06:55.279 --> 00:06:55.289 
but that's okay because after Lee cheat

00:06:55.289 --> 00:06:57.860 
but that's okay because after Lee cheat
it<00:06:55.469> does<00:06:55.620> less<00:06:55.949> than<00:06:55.979> half<00:06:56.370> and<00:06:56.669> as<00:06:57.419> long<00:06:57.629> as<00:06:57.810> I

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:57.870 
it does less than half and as long as I

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:00.320 
it does less than half and as long as I
don't<00:06:57.930> get<00:06:58.139> paralyzed<00:06:58.650> I'm<00:06:59.039> able<00:06:59.310> to<00:06:59.550> live
