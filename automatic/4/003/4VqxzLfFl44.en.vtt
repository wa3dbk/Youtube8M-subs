to me spring after your spring then see

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.109 
to me spring after your spring then see
me<00:01:38.200> spring<00:01:38.799> is<00:01:39.280> where<00:01:39.630> after<00:01:40.630> your<00:01:40.750> spring

all<00:01:46.929> right<00:01:48.119> then<00:01:49.350> SB<00:01:50.350> rotators<00:01:50.920> should<00:01:51.340> work

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
all right then SB rotators should work

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.850 
all right then SB rotators should work
before<00:01:52.630> I<00:01:52.659> can<00:01:52.840> get<00:01:52.990> mind<00:01:53.259> or<00:01:53.470> without
