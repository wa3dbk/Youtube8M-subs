00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hi the waterbed is cool i have 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.339
 today a tutorial for you 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.379
 maybe about those who are useful 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.990
 go to high school because 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.700
 the cover of your schoolbooks 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.530
 every year the weather is such every summer 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.330
 thing you have to do all your books again 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.970
 provided with paper and I found it 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.230
 never really fun in the past and I walked 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.880
 the secret mother the first few times 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.630
 always do it because I always forgot 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.880
 how to do it 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.619
 but no it is really important that 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.880
 you can book a better cover 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.039
 gotta stick me nice to show 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.090
 how you can do what you need is 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.160
 cover paper 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.239
 I have two roles here and it is 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.730
 important that you actually actually 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.440
 you have paper that is much sturdier than 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.690
 wrapping paper it looks alike 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.950
 woke up pierce really thicker and it is 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.530
 the intention that I book you sharp 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.879
 so get good cover 4 i like this book 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.649
 example covers 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.960
 this is a good example of how 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.430
 books of their self were given with such 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.780
 thing that really isn't enough 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.760
 for your schoolbooks 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.649
 it is nice for such pants 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.440
 because textbooks go like the bag and 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.640
 adore and young lay all the edges 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.899
 protector 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.400
 this is what you need your book for 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:09.299
 cover paper you can use scissors and tape 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.619
 takes you on it and you put your book down and 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.020
 just like with a gift 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.590
 packing is how you do it 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:20.070
 Only then do you make sure it is here 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.280
 an edge it needs a little bit bigger 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.280
 to be 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.130
 so and then you close your book 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.200
 that is very important the mistakes that 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.170
 made here by themselves but 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:39.869
 hope this is it but no you blow it like that 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:42.409
 Then connect this to the one you book 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.409
 bit on 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.729
 and here you must do the same here must 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.000
 go in again such an edge so must 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:55.009
 about to come here what i'm going to do 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.009
 if i cut this off 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:06.150
 so print the book well take this again 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:10.649
 then you do it compacted in a staircase 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:14.700
 start is there he is not bought series 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:18.480
 just press such a round well 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:21.600
 so now it's important to see up 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.380
 where this is what i always bought 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:30.140
 do it 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:39.900
 d cut in and then 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:42.780
 eveline then you open it and you should 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.910
 see that this is no longer right because 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.110
 there is still a part there you have to 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.870
 the turns push you very well 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.330
 positions where that line is now you want 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.320
 this flap here some who do this i 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.310
 I personally don't mind so much 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.800
 beautiful 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:59.489
 so what is nicer if you put this star in it 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:04.140
 have such a slant 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:05.880
 kind of gift but you can do it that way 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:07.440
 but this one was very big 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.110
 because it doesn't say so wrong just like that 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:15.180
 going to make something smaller i cut one here 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:26.010
 piece from then factory this joe and me 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:28.350
 must take into account that line and 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.840
 then this should be right there 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:34.829
 in this often goes wrong so what do you do 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:41.780
 claps and already winner close and then 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:41.780
 you just stop between so and 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:51.130
 just press and light 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:53.680
 and now you go again if so then you do 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.000
 open it and here he goes slides 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.680
 a bit to the side 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.990
 you should not really pull tight 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.850
 or so just let go and here one 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:05.020
 add adhesive tape 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:08.920
 clumps and adhesive tape 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:12.420
 check yes until so 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.420
 you do the same on the other side 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:26.389
 if you have something and this thing out here 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:27.800
 it came to cut off or as you did 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:37.370
 do quite perfect so then you fold 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:40.370
 trijntje still nice so now we have one 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:43.009
 cast off and then we go the other way 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:47.180
 Post here this indent, 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:50.830
 press well open allowing this 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.830
 further than not let it work like this 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:06.050
 look if you want extra fancy then do 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:07.460
 you still have this for example some people 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.960
 they then try to fix this on their book 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.530
 but that is such a shame then you can book it 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.530
 also most walk 

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:21.180
 this is it this is how you put a book on one 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:23.760
 basic way it can be cover remember 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.740
 to add something from a label 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.690
 this one nice that i put it here 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.070
 for instance 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:34.740
 and here you can enter the box and your name 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:35.970
 write it down and this is him 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.680
 you can also use something else and 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.870
 cover paper which is also very sturdy 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.400
 for example a magazine 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.590
 What you often do with captions is that 

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.660
 the outside is a bit thicker 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:46.650
 plastic and this is really only possible with some 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.930
 smaller books 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:51.930
 small textbooks but what you can do 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:53.550
 is you can pick it up outside 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:55.860
 a few old magazines because there 

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:59.580
 bee and the tooth 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:01.770
 you like and put your book down like that 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:03.750
 this around it and you actually do it exactly 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:07.940
 same as what I just did 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:07.940
 you fold this inwards 

00:06:13.069 --> 00:06:17.120
 This is slightly more difficult because it is free 

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:20.120
 is sturdy but it does protect your book 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.860
 super good because it is so sturdy come 

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:23.749
 for google's in it 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:26.389
 and tricks to do just that 

00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:28.939
 and here to paste them you have him 

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:30.860
 actually the good position so well he 

00:06:28.939 --> 00:06:33.080
 is completely covered around the seat another 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:34.789
 little air in construction all your purchased 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:37.159
 books together that a tip 

00:06:34.789 --> 00:06:38.539
 it all squeezes room and you 

00:06:37.159 --> 00:06:41.569
 specify that it is completely perfect 

00:06:38.539 --> 00:06:43.639
 flat is how nice this looks 

00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:44.870
 and don't forget to add a label 

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:46.759
 add door 

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:47.870
 you can also live here or here 

00:06:46.759 --> 00:06:50.529
 then do it 

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:50.529
 did you have it in the middle 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.120
 I have now shown two ways but 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:58.340
 There are of course many more you two more 

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:00.050
 tips you can use on newspaper 

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:03.020
 it was something that her dose praised 

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:05.539
 just several layers on top of each other and 

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:07.969
 you can also use white a4s 

00:07:05.539 --> 00:07:09.080
 it is small if you mean this book 

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:10.460
 stick with it 

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.870
 yes then you really have to piece or four 

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:12.469
 do n't have to meet each other first 

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:14.360
 to stick 

00:07:12.469 --> 00:07:16.430
 but this is a very cheap option you 

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:18.469
 I can also do that nice colored for that 

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:20.539
 use flavor first of mega bright and 

00:07:18.469 --> 00:07:22.669
 you can do that with your book well this was it 

00:07:20.539 --> 00:07:24.319
 it i have shown two ways of 

00:07:22.669 --> 00:07:25.610
 I hope you cover books 

00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:26.810
 liked it and you might find something there 

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:28.310
 Thank you for looking 

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:34.060
 and see you again soon 

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:34.060
 well you in this
