fold<00:04:03.500> down<00:04:03.769> now<00:04:04.130> like<00:04:04.340> most<00:04:04.549> headsets<00:04:05.150> these

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
fold down now like most headsets these

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.810 
fold down now like most headsets these

padding on both the ear cuffs and as
well<00:04:12.380> they<00:04:12.919> are

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
well they are

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.210 
well they are
are<00:04:13.280> not<00:04:13.760> too<00:04:14.530> tight<00:04:15.530> in<00:04:15.770> other<00:04:15.920> words<00:04:16.130> they're

are not too tight in other words they're

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.970 
are not too tight in other words they're
not<00:04:16.250> spring-loaded<00:04:17.239> too<00:04:17.660> heavily<00:04:18.230> so<00:04:18.739> they

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:18.980 
not spring-loaded too heavily so they

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:21.370 
not spring-loaded too heavily so they
should<00:04:19.340> not<00:04:19.550> you<00:04:20.150> know<00:04:20.239> pinch<00:04:20.600> your<00:04:20.810> ears<00:04:21.140> and

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:30.170 
play in them and that should make it

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.170 
play in them and that should make it
even<00:04:30.620> more<00:04:30.890> comfortable<00:04:31.460> the<00:04:31.790> inline

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
even more comfortable the inline

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.720 
even more comfortable the inline
