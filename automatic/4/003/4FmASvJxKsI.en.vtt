pad and a rear pad on this board as I

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.780 
pad and a rear pad on this board as I
find<00:01:03.329> that<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.719> wax<00:01:04.170> moves<00:01:04.830> very<00:01:05.100> quickly<00:01:05.220> and

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
find that the wax moves very quickly and

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.310 
find that the wax moves very quickly and
I<00:01:05.820> have<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.090> relax<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.689> world<00:01:06.930> pretty<00:01:07.260> much

once every hour if I'm writing it and as
this<00:01:10.260> is<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.530> board<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:11.010> rightmost<00:01:11.490> a

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
this is the board that I rightmost a

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.320 
this is the board that I rightmost a
rather<00:01:12.330> write<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:12.780> with<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:12.930> pad<00:01:14.119> most<00:01:15.119> of<00:01:15.240> my

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
rather write it with a pad most of my

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.109 
rather write it with a pad most of my
boards<00:01:15.659> are<00:01:15.750> set<00:01:15.960> up<00:01:16.080> with<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.320> FCS<00:01:17.189> fin<00:01:17.850> plug

system<00:01:19.340> there's<00:01:20.340> two<00:01:20.549> reasons<00:01:20.729> I<00:01:21.030> like<00:01:21.210> this

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
system there's two reasons I like this

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.840 
system there's two reasons I like this
in<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.840> system<00:01:22.229> one<00:01:22.710> is<00:01:23.009> very<00:01:23.369> easy<00:01:23.670> for

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
in the system one is very easy for

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.080 
in the system one is very easy for
traveling<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.740> to<00:01:25.740> you<00:01:26.009> have<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.220> huge<00:01:26.729> huge

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
traveling and to you have a huge huge

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.880 
traveling and to you have a huge huge
selection<00:01:27.630> of<00:01:27.689> things<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.200> choose<00:01:28.409> from<00:01:28.470> from

selection of things to choose from from

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.330 
selection of things to choose from from
SES<00:01:30.200> the<00:01:31.200> other<00:01:31.320> really<00:01:31.890> nice<00:01:32.040> thing<00:01:32.310> about

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
SES the other really nice thing about

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.160 
SES the other really nice thing about
FCS<00:01:32.909> is<00:01:33.119> no<00:01:33.240> matter<00:01:33.450> where<00:01:33.720> you<00:01:33.840> go<00:01:33.869> in<00:01:33.990> the

around here towards the tail of the
board<00:01:47.170> into<00:01:48.170> a<00:01:48.200> very<00:01:48.619> very<00:01:48.829> slight<00:01:49.189> fear<00:01:49.549> in

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
board into a very very slight fear in

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.870 
board into a very very slight fear in
the<00:01:49.789> back<00:01:49.820> and<00:01:50.350> for<00:01:51.350> me<00:01:51.469> this<00:01:51.759> represents<00:01:52.759> the

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
the back and for me this represents the

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.480 
the back and for me this represents the
best<00:01:53.060> compromise<00:01:53.509> inboard<00:01:54.289> shape<00:01:54.590> it's

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
best compromise inboard shape it's

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.609 
best compromise inboard shape it's
smooth<00:01:55.939> and<00:01:56.210> custom<00:01:56.659> the<00:01:56.780> water<00:01:57.020> good<00:01:57.259> but

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
smooth and custom the water good but

00:01:57.619 --> 00:01:59.620 
smooth and custom the water good but
when<00:01:57.799> you<00:01:57.829> turn<00:01:58.189> it<00:01:58.220> the<00:01:58.729> V<00:01:58.939> is<00:01:59.060> working<00:01:59.479> really

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
when you turn it the V is working really

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.100 
when you turn it the V is working really
good<00:01:59.780> to<00:02:00.049> make<00:02:00.170> it<00:02:00.319> snappy<00:02:01.420> the<00:02:02.420> rails<00:02:02.689> on<00:02:02.960> this

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
good to make it snappy the rails on this

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.690 
good to make it snappy the rails on this
board<00:02:03.409> are<00:02:03.619> pretty<00:02:03.860> similar<00:02:04.189> to<00:02:04.369> that<00:02:04.490> of<00:02:04.549> a

that's<00:02:15.980> quite<00:02:16.400> different<00:02:16.430> about<00:02:17.000> this<00:02:17.180> board

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
from standard surfboard is that it's

around riding for now you'll notice that

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:55.150 
around riding for now you'll notice that
in<00:02:53.000> the<00:02:53.150> outline<00:02:53.480> of<00:02:53.510> this<00:02:53.750> board<00:02:54.079> it<00:02:54.889> goes

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
in the outline of this board it goes

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.240 
in the outline of this board it goes
very<00:02:55.430> straight<00:02:55.880> towards<00:02:56.299> the<00:02:56.389> tail<00:02:56.630> here<00:02:57.250> this

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
very straight towards the tail here this

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:59.590 
very straight towards the tail here this
means<00:02:58.519> that<00:02:58.670> when<00:02:58.880> you're<00:02:59.060> pushing<00:02:59.420> really

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
means that when you're pushing really

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.210 
means that when you're pushing really
hard<00:02:59.690> in<00:03:00.049> the<00:03:00.139> bottom<00:03:00.440> telling<00:03:00.799> me<00:03:00.920> off<00:03:01.010> the

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
hard in the bottom telling me off the

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.830 
hard in the bottom telling me off the
lip<00:03:01.400> you<00:03:01.730> get<00:03:01.880> a<00:03:01.910> lot<00:03:02.090> more<00:03:02.120> grip<00:03:02.569> from<00:03:02.780> the

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
lip you get a lot more grip from the

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.860 
lip you get a lot more grip from the
board<00:03:03.370> the<00:03:04.370> downside<00:03:04.880> is<00:03:05.180> when<00:03:05.299> the<00:03:05.420> waves<00:03:05.630> get

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
board the downside is when the waves get

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.000 
board the downside is when the waves get
bigger<00:03:05.900> it<00:03:06.739> gets<00:03:06.920> very<00:03:07.069> very<00:03:07.459> hard<00:03:07.700> to<00:03:07.850> control
