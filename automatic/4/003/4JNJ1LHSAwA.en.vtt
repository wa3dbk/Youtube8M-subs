person and a robot and that's what this

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.920 
person and a robot and that's what this
is<00:00:31.769> going<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.189> demonstrate<00:00:32.340> for<00:00:33.030> you<00:00:33.210> you<00:00:33.750> see

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
is going to demonstrate for you you see

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.350 
is going to demonstrate for you you see
the<00:00:34.050> robot<00:00:34.230> is<00:00:34.680> our<00:00:34.980> seven<00:00:35.370> axis<00:00:35.730> machine<00:00:36.090> and

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
the robot is our seven axis machine and

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.049 
the robot is our seven axis machine and
it's<00:00:36.809> running<00:00:37.200> at<00:00:37.320> full<00:00:37.530> speed<00:00:37.950> in<00:00:38.280> its<00:00:38.640> zone

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
it's running at full speed in its zone

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.770 
it's running at full speed in its zone
but<00:00:39.780> as<00:00:39.899> soon<00:00:40.110> as<00:00:40.230> I<00:00:40.410> approach<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.600> enter<00:00:42.600> into

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
but as soon as I approach and enter into

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.410 
but as soon as I approach and enter into
a<00:00:43.500> collaborative<00:00:44.219> area<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:45.090> robot

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
a collaborative area the robot

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.299 
a collaborative area the robot
automatically<00:00:46.230> slows<00:00:46.500> down<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:46.980> two<00:00:47.160> hundred

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
automatically slows down to two hundred

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.580 
automatically slows down to two hundred
and<00:00:47.520> fifty<00:00:47.670> millimeters<00:00:48.270> per<00:00:48.420> second<00:00:48.870> this<00:00:49.289> is

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
and fifty millimeters per second this is

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.150 
and fifty millimeters per second this is
the<00:00:49.620> safety<00:00:50.430> speed<00:00:51.710> dictated<00:00:52.710> by<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.920> new

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
the safety speed dictated by the new

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.330 
the safety speed dictated by the new
standard<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:54.149> knows<00:00:54.449> I'm<00:00:54.780> in<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.140> zone

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
standard it knows I'm in the zone

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.520 
standard it knows I'm in the zone
because<00:00:56.340> we<00:00:56.489> have<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.699> safety<00:00:57.180> rated<00:00:57.809> sensor<00:00:58.350> a

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
because we have a safety rated sensor a

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.950 
because we have a safety rated sensor a
laser<00:00:58.890> scanner<00:00:59.399> that's<00:00:59.879> under<00:01:00.390> that<00:01:00.750> knows

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
laser scanner that's under that knows

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.979 
laser scanner that's under that knows
when<00:01:01.199> I've<00:01:01.350> crossed<00:01:01.620> in<00:01:01.890> so<00:01:02.340> I'm<00:01:03.210> working<00:01:03.780> in

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
when I've crossed in so I'm working in

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.380 
when I've crossed in so I'm working in
its<00:01:04.199> area<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:05.280> robot<00:01:05.610> automatically

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
its area and the robot automatically

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.469 
its area and the robot automatically
slows<00:01:06.720> down<00:01:07.369> so<00:01:08.369> in<00:01:08.640> this<00:01:08.880> case<00:01:09.119> what<00:01:09.330> we're

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
slows down so in this case what we're

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:10.820 
slows down so in this case what we're
attempting<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.990> what<00:01:10.380> we're<00:01:10.500> demonstrating

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
attempting to what we're demonstrating

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.730 
attempting to what we're demonstrating
is<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:12.240> concept<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:12.990> collaborative<00:01:13.590> work

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
is the concept of collaborative work

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.859 
is the concept of collaborative work
what<00:01:14.130> would<00:01:14.280> you<00:01:14.400> do<00:01:14.580> if<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:14.909> had<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.450> third

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
what would you do if you had a third

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.350 
what would you do if you had a third
hand<00:01:16.170> from<00:01:16.350> an<00:01:16.470> assembly<00:01:16.860> perspective<00:01:17.520> so<00:01:18.270> the

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
hand from an assembly perspective so the

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.480 
hand from an assembly perspective so the
robot<00:01:18.659> is<00:01:18.750> going<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:18.930> come<00:01:19.110> in<00:01:19.320> pick<00:01:20.189> up<00:01:20.340> a

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
robot is going to come in pick up a

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.690 
robot is going to come in pick up a
component

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
component

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.480 
component
and<00:01:22.930> presented<00:01:23.930> to<00:01:24.079> me<00:01:24.229> as<00:01:24.469> the<00:01:24.649> operator<00:01:25.159> for

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
and presented to me as the operator for

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.310 
and presented to me as the operator for
an<00:01:25.579> assembly<00:01:25.880> process<00:01:26.570> so<00:01:27.110> I'll<00:01:27.259> go<00:01:27.469> in

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
an assembly process so I'll go in

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.580 
an assembly process so I'll go in
perform<00:01:30.320> some<00:01:30.590> assembly<00:01:31.189> and<00:01:32.170> then<00:01:33.170> have<00:01:33.409> the

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
perform some assembly and then have the

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.910 
perform some assembly and then have the
robot<00:01:33.770> reorient<00:01:34.610> apart<00:01:35.030> and<00:01:35.530> reset<00:01:36.530> it<00:01:36.560> for

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
robot reorient apart and reset it for

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.160 
robot reorient apart and reset it for
the<00:01:37.039> next<00:01:37.310> pick<00:01:37.820> position<00:01:38.329> and<00:01:38.539> then<00:01:38.840> bring<00:01:39.049> it

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
the next pick position and then bring it

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.890 
the next pick position and then bring it
back<00:01:39.200> to<00:01:39.649> me

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.719 

as<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.650> does<00:01:43.860> that

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.480 

now<00:01:47.329> that<00:01:47.539> I<00:01:47.630> come<00:01:47.869> back<00:01:48.079> in<00:01:48.409> I'm<00:01:49.100> allowed<00:01:49.460> to

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
now that I come back in I'm allowed to

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.319 
now that I come back in I'm allowed to
work<00:01:49.939> on<00:01:50.240> this<00:01:50.420> robot<00:01:50.960> because<00:01:51.439> it<00:01:51.710> is<00:01:52.250> at<00:01:52.549> zero

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:53.329 
work on this robot because it is at zero

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:56.109 
work on this robot because it is at zero

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
while it was moving that is a violation

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.479 
while it was moving that is a violation
of<00:02:14.000> stop<00:02:14.269> state<00:02:14.660> so<00:02:15.440> it<00:02:15.709> makes<00:02:16.010> sure<00:02:16.099> that<00:02:16.220> I'm

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
of stop state so it makes sure that I'm

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:18.670 
of stop state so it makes sure that I'm
clear<00:02:16.670> of<00:02:16.879> the<00:02:17.030> zone<00:02:17.239> and<00:02:17.540> then<00:02:18.170> it<00:02:18.290> will<00:02:18.410> start

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
clear of the zone and then it will start

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:24.860 
clear of the zone and then it will start
again<00:02:19.040> and<00:02:19.280> we'll<00:02:19.940> be<00:02:20.030> go<00:02:20.150> back<00:02:20.180> to<00:02:20.480> work

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.640 

I'm<00:02:25.440> going<00:02:25.590> to<00:02:25.650> show<00:02:25.799> that<00:02:25.980> to<00:02:26.040> you<00:02:26.310> again<00:02:27.650> so

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
I'm going to show that to you again so

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.199 
I'm going to show that to you again so
I'm<00:02:28.709> going<00:02:28.890> to<00:02:28.920> send<00:02:29.159> the<00:02:29.220> robot<00:02:29.580> on<00:02:29.760> its<00:02:29.940> next

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.039 
I'm going to send the robot on its next
