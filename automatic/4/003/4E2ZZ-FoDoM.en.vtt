00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:45.020 
going to and they're basically the

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.409 
going to and they're basically the
course<00:05:45.620> it's<00:05:46.040> up<00:05:46.190> to<00:05:46.310> my<00:05:46.430> standards<00:05:46.970> as<00:05:47.090> it's<00:05:47.300> a

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:47.419 
course it's up to my standards as it's a

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:49.720 
course it's up to my standards as it's a
one<00:05:47.630> hundred<00:05:47.900> percent<00:05:47.930> coursework<00:05:48.680> so<00:05:49.100> that

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:49.730 
one hundred percent coursework so that

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:52.450 
one hundred percent coursework so that

would be no exams meaning no written
work<00:05:52.730> so<00:05:53.060> yeah<00:05:53.860> that's<00:05:54.860> I<00:05:55.190> would<00:05:55.430> probably<00:05:55.580> get

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:55.850 
work so yeah that's I would probably get

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:57.520

00:05:59.560 --> 00:05:59.570 
that's gone to the next question so the

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:01.120 
that's gone to the next question so the
last<00:05:59.720> question<00:05:59.840> in<00:06:00.200> the<00:06:00.290> Q&amp;A<00:06:00.530> is<00:06:00.710> by<00:06:00.860> someone
