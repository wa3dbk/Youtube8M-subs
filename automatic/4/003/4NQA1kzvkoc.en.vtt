little<00:01:06.350> cross<00:01:06.650> at<00:01:06.860> it<00:01:06.979> on<00:01:07.070> the<00:01:07.159> side<00:01:07.370> even

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
little cross at it on the side even

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.370 
little cross at it on the side even
though<00:01:07.729> it's<00:01:07.850> not<00:01:07.970> a<00:01:08.210> weapon<00:01:08.420> it's<00:01:08.750> just<00:01:08.960> part

of<00:01:09.470> the<00:01:09.530> armor<00:01:09.830> itself<00:01:10.100> but<00:01:10.490> I<00:01:10.760> think<00:01:11.750> it's

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
of the armor itself but I think it's

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.039

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.300 
case and as far as I know these do not
have<00:06:22.510> special<00:06:22.900> abilities<00:06:23.290> based<00:06:24.040> on<00:06:24.220> the

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:24.310 
have special abilities based on the

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:26.730 
have special abilities based on the
color<00:06:24.550> is<00:06:24.760> just<00:06:24.900> pretty<00:06:25.900> much<00:06:25.990> a<00:06:26.140> palette<00:06:26.500> swap

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:26.740 
color is just pretty much a palette swap

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:31.950 
color is just pretty much a palette swap
but<00:06:28.950> again<00:06:29.950> I<00:06:29.980> like<00:06:30.160> the<00:06:30.310> general<00:06:30.640> idea<00:06:30.960> it's

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:31.960 
but again I like the general idea it's

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.530 
but again I like the general idea it's
just<00:06:32.080> the<00:06:32.440> execution<00:06:32.830> as<00:06:33.520> far<00:06:34.090> as<00:06:34.210> being<00:06:34.360> able

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:34.540 
just the execution as far as being able

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:36.390 
just the execution as far as being able
to<00:06:34.660> ride<00:06:34.870> them<00:06:35.110> goes<00:06:35.290> needs<00:06:35.800> a<00:06:35.920> little<00:06:36.100> work

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:36.400 
to ride them goes needs a little work

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.580 
to ride them goes needs a little work
