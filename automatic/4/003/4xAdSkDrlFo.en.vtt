I<00:00:44.450> think<00:00:45.080> we<00:00:45.170> may<00:00:45.350> actually<00:00:45.379> have<00:00:45.710> a<00:00:45.830> homicide

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370

here<00:00:46.610> first<00:00:47.300> one<00:00:47.480> in<00:00:47.570> 15<00:00:48.110> years<00:00:49.150> public<00:00:50.150> cannot

here first one in 15 years public cannot
be<00:00:50.750> allowed<00:00:51.020> to<00:00:51.079> get<00:00:51.410> the<00:00:51.440> idea<00:00:51.800> that<00:00:51.860> using<00:00:52.400> a

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
be allowed to get the idea that using a

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:57.010 
be allowed to get the idea that using a
surrogate<00:00:52.760> can<00:00:53.150> be<00:00:53.270> fatal<00:00:55.600> especially<00:00:56.600> if

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 
surrogate can be fatal especially if

surrogate can be fatal especially if
it's<00:00:57.140> true

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
it's true

I just want to know how an operator can
be<00:01:01.449> killed<00:01:01.809> by<00:01:02.050> signals<00:01:02.559> from<00:01:02.710> a<00:01:02.739> surrogate<00:01:03.280> if

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
be killed by signals from a surrogate if

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:05.760 
be killed by signals from a surrogate if
it<00:01:04.210> were<00:01:04.299> possible<00:01:04.540> would<00:01:04.989> it<00:01:05.140> be<00:01:05.229> the<00:01:05.379> entire

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
it were possible would it be the entire
