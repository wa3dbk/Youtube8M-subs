00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.570
 channel and maybe my own 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.399
 channel you can check that out 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.199
 no spin spin the we become the disc 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.519
 play at the skywars 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.770
 skywars actually means that the 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.049
 differences in the islands are chic and 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.659
 at such a large still a middle island 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.010
 every island has a coffin where starts 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.200
 stuff in it 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.390
 and as you can see everyone has here 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.580
 a chest mens' shirt on 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.259
 survival sometimes the trees are sometimes codes 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.750
 or tools made sometimes I need mine 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.240
 stuff that get chest and so find 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.650
 they other island you send or you must have seemed like 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.840
 the middle 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.360
 and there you can do a lot of stuff too 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.260
 find here you can kill people and 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.220
 genes 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.990
 the last remaining one so that wins 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.180
 no that is last remaining cycles 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.030
 violent kill the win 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.370
 I kind of hope it's clear 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.110
 I want I have the best 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.970
 or to explain it as well as possible 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.130
 hopefully you understand 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.990
 and maybe no it then i would do it 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.330
 also find fat julia 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.580
 if you leave your opinion 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.690
 about the game's carlos 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.590
 I am very curious what you think of it 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.290

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.850

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.399

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.560

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:15.540

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:31.000
 so that someone is standing still 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:35.770
