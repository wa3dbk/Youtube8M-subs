00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.490 
WrestleMania view because I think that
is<00:01:35.189> a<00:01:35.220> big<00:01:35.700> money<00:01:36.299> match<00:01:36.540> that<00:01:36.869> taker<00:01:37.110> can<00:01:37.259> have

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
is a big money match that taker can have

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.160 
is a big money match that taker can have
as<00:01:38.040> far<00:01:38.310> as<00:01:38.460> Triple<00:01:38.850> H<00:01:39.000> I<00:01:39.270> think<00:01:39.509> Triple<00:01:39.810> H<00:01:39.930> will

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
as far as Triple H I think Triple H will

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.790 
as far as Triple H I think Triple H will
be<00:01:40.290> as

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:40.800 
be as

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.130 
be as
but<00:01:41.550> the<00:01:41.670> busy<00:01:41.940> man<00:01:42.150> character<00:01:42.480> was<00:01:42.750> I<00:01:42.780> think

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
but the busy man character was I think

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.960 
but the busy man character was I think
as<00:01:43.290> long<00:01:43.440> as<00:01:43.620> he<00:01:43.740> takes<00:01:43.950> over<00:01:44.160> the<00:01:44.400> company<00:01:44.580> in

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
as long as he takes over the company in

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.610 
as long as he takes over the company in
the<00:01:45.120> way<00:01:45.240> it<00:01:45.420> looks<00:01:45.690> like<00:01:45.750> he's<00:01:46.020> going<00:01:46.260> to<00:01:46.380> do

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620 
the way it looks like he's going to do

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.680 
the way it looks like he's going to do
with<00:01:46.890> Stephanie<00:01:47.400> I<00:01:47.610> think<00:01:48.090> he<00:01:48.300> could<00:01:48.450> always

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
with Stephanie I think he could always

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.270 
with Stephanie I think he could always
be<00:01:48.900> that<00:01:49.170> Vince<00:01:49.380> ich<00:01:49.500> main<00:01:49.650> character<00:01:50.070> that

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
be that Vince ich main character that

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.100 
be that Vince ich main character that
fights<00:01:50.520> against<00:01:50.850> them<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.150> like<00:01:51.300> CM<00:01:51.570> Punk<00:01:51.900> or

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110
