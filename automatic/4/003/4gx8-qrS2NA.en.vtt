00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:42.250
This is a climbing course, not just a climb to a mountain. We're not here just to climb a mountain.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.830
Students then really learn a bit about climbing philosophy

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.400
Everyone learn to focus not just on the summit but on the whole mountain

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.450
By the end they should have the knowledge

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:05.960
enough to climb an intermediate / easy-intermediate mountain

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.510
Acclimatisation.. this is the boring bit

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:30.770
This is the part when the students hang out in La Paz hydrating

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.430
And we're finally here at 4700 metres at a beautiful mountain hut

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.460
Here on the mountain

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:45.090
And we have great views, this really motivates the students

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.970
Our climbing course isn't just action, we learn a lot of theory. So then we stay here...

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.220
stick around the fireplace having theoretical classes

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.440
talking about acclimatisation and all the stuff people usually don't know

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.600
From here on, we start with the real stuff

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.860

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.770
ACTION

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.259
... So your toes go first. By that I mean this whole part, not the tiptoe ok?

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.200
And when you are going down

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.000
You use your heels first

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.109
From now on, we start with the practical classes

00:02:11.109 --> 00:02:13.029
For that we will

00:02:13.029 --> 00:02:17.191
go up to the ice, which is at a glacier at the base of the mountain

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:21.199
we will learn

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:23.889
How to use crampons, how to walk on double boots

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:25.300
which are the boots we use for ice climbing

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:47.500
Fall !

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.100
(evil laugh...)

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.069
And there we'll have crevasse training.. which are those cracks...

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:01.300
on the ice

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.400
The summit is just a bonus at the end of the course

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.989
Huayna Potosi is a 6088 metre peak: not too small. It scares people a bit...

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:33.600
But lets do it!
