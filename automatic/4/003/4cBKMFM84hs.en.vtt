you<00:00:20.010> jump<00:00:20.310> in<00:00:20.520> let's<00:00:21.270> actually<00:00:21.960> speak<00:00:22.590> about

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
you jump in let's actually speak about

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.620 
you jump in let's actually speak about
this<00:00:22.890> because<00:00:23.039> it's<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:23.460> little<00:00:23.910> bit<00:00:24.029> confusing

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
this because it's a little bit confusing

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.040 
this because it's a little bit confusing
so<00:00:25.590> a<00:00:25.949> couple<00:00:26.910> of<00:00:27.119> viewers<00:00:27.510> have<00:00:27.720> actually

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
so a couple of viewers have actually

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.439 
so a couple of viewers have actually
been<00:00:28.170> questioning<00:00:28.890> my<00:00:29.699> fault<00:00:30.029> on<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.330> new

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
been questioning my fault on the new

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.659 
been questioning my fault on the new
Radeon<00:00:31.019> service<00:00:31.349> cards<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:31.920> there<00:00:32.309> are<00:00:32.489> a

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
Radeon service cards and there are a

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.490 
Radeon service cards and there are a
plethora<00:00:33.000> of<00:00:33.300> different<00:00:33.420> cards<00:00:34.200> that<00:00:34.290> have

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
plethora of different cards that have

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.590 
plethora of different cards that have
been<00:00:34.680> available<00:00:34.920> their<00:00:35.760> most<00:00:35.850> powerful<00:00:36.090> among

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
been available their most powerful among

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.580 
been available their most powerful among
them<00:00:36.840> for<00:00:37.050> example<00:00:37.440> being<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.680> r9<00:00:38.420> 280x

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:39.590 
them for example being the r9 280x

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:46.420 
them for example being the r9 280x
currently<00:00:40.590> however<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.850> r9<00:00:43.789> 290x<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.629> r9

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
currently however the r9 290x and the r9

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.360 
currently however the r9 290x and the r9
290<00:00:47.430> are<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.879> only<00:00:48.649> cards<00:00:49.649> based<00:00:50.070> on<00:00:50.340> a

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
290 are the only cards based on a

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.330 
290 are the only cards based on a
completely<00:00:50.879> new<00:00:51.149> architecture<00:00:52.039> to<00:00:53.039> put<00:00:53.219> it

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
completely new architecture to put it

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.910 
completely new architecture to put it
simply<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:54.120> r9<00:00:54.890> 280x<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.219> below<00:00:56.760> are

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
simply the r9 280x and below are

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.080 
simply the r9 280x and below are
basically<00:00:58.920> you<00:00:59.190> could<00:00:59.520> think<00:00:59.760> of<00:00:59.879> them<00:01:00.059> as

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
basically you could think of them as

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.990 
basically you could think of them as
pretty<00:01:00.539> much<00:01:00.719> re<00:01:01.140> badges<00:01:01.710> of<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.550> current

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
pretty much re badges of the current

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.880 
pretty much re badges of the current
generation<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.840> cards<00:01:04.700> so<00:01:05.700> just<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.299> clarify

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
generation of cards so just to clarify

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.260 
generation of cards so just to clarify
for<00:01:07.890> example<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.880> radeon<00:01:09.360> r9<00:01:10.490> 280x<00:01:11.490> is<00:01:11.939> pretty

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
for example the radeon r9 280x is pretty

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.749 
for example the radeon r9 280x is pretty
much<00:01:12.420> exactly<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.960> same<00:01:13.260> as<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.770> radeon<00:01:15.590> 7970

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 
much exactly the same as the radeon 7970

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:19.730 
much exactly the same as the radeon 7970
so<00:01:17.759> it<00:01:17.970> will<00:01:18.119> still<00:01:18.390> have<00:01:18.659> 30<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.290> compute

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
so it will still have 30 to compute

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.320 
so it will still have 30 to compute
units<00:01:20.600> 2048<00:01:22.130> stream<00:01:23.130> processors<00:01:23.580> or<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:24.030> lose

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
units 2048 stream processors or a lose

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.770 
units 2048 stream processors or a lose
if<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.600> prefer<00:01:25.400> 128<00:01:26.400> texture<00:01:27.119> units<00:01:27.299> and

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
if you prefer 128 texture units and

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.730 
if you prefer 128 texture units and
we'll<00:01:28.229> still<00:01:28.470> have<00:01:28.770> 32<00:01:29.310> drops<00:01:29.670> and<00:01:30.030> so<00:01:31.020> on<00:01:31.320> and

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
we'll still have 32 drops and so on and

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.039 
we'll still have 32 drops and so on and
so<00:01:31.799> on<00:01:32.040> it'll<00:01:32.610> also<00:01:32.700> still<00:01:33.119> have<00:01:33.299> the<00:01:33.540> same<00:01:33.780> and

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
so on it'll also still have the same and

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.520 
so on it'll also still have the same and
memory<00:01:34.409> bus<00:01:35.220> width<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:35.820> also<00:01:36.659> have<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.259> same

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
memory bus width and also have the same

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.940 
memory bus width and also have the same
amount<00:01:37.680> of<00:01:37.860> ramp<00:01:38.159> but<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.630> next<00:01:40.079> that<00:01:40.350> the

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
amount of ramp but the next that the

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.929 
amount of ramp but the next that the
next<00:01:41.369> generation<00:01:41.430> is<00:01:42.119> going<00:01:42.360> to<00:01:42.420> be<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.750> r9

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 
next generation is going to be the r9

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:48.399 
next generation is going to be the r9
290<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.170> r9<00:01:46.170> 290x<00:01:47.159> they're<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.149> new

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
290 and r9 290x they're the new

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:51.350 
290 and r9 290x they're the new
architectures<00:01:49.409> but<00:01:49.979> we<00:01:50.369> do<00:01:50.640> have<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:51.090> piece<00:01:51.329> of

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
architectures but we do have a piece of

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.190 
architectures but we do have a piece of
good<00:01:51.750> news<00:01:52.009> now<00:01:53.009> firstly<00:01:53.810> AMD<00:01:54.810> are<00:01:54.899> going<00:01:55.110> to

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
good news now firstly AMD are going to

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.090 
good news now firstly AMD are going to
be<00:01:55.259> soon<00:01:55.890> stopping<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.850> shipments<00:01:57.570> of<00:01:57.689> the

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
be soon stopping the shipments of the

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.920 
be soon stopping the shipments of the
7970<00:01:59.100> just<00:01:59.909> for<00:02:00.030> example<00:02:00.090> up<00:02:00.479> as<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.719> previous

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
7970 just for example up as the previous

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.200 
7970 just for example up as the previous
generation<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:01.710> focusing<00:02:02.579> on<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:03.030> latest

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
generation and focusing on the latest

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.399 
generation and focusing on the latest
generation<00:02:03.570> but<00:02:04.530> if<00:02:05.360> you're<00:02:06.360> wondering<00:02:06.719> where

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
generation but if you're wondering where

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.350 
generation but if you're wondering where
does<00:02:07.590> this<00:02:07.710> leave<00:02:08.039> you<00:02:08.369> well

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
does this leave you well

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.110 
does this leave you well
in<00:02:10.620> pretty<00:02:11.620> good<00:02:11.710> situation<00:02:12.460> actually<00:02:12.640> let's

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
in pretty good situation actually let's

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.190 
in pretty good situation actually let's
assume<00:02:13.570> that<00:02:14.260> you<00:02:14.410> have<00:02:14.620> a<00:02:14.860> radeon<00:02:15.450> 7970<00:02:16.450> let's

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
assume that you have a radeon 7970 let's

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.110 
assume that you have a radeon 7970 let's
just<00:02:17.410> made<00:02:17.560> that<00:02:17.710> assumption<00:02:18.070> and<00:02:18.430> let's

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
just made that assumption and let's

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.190 
just made that assumption and let's
further<00:02:19.600> assume<00:02:19.920> that<00:02:20.920> you<00:02:21.580> don't<00:02:22.210> have<00:02:23.050> the

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
further assume that you don't have the

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.050 
further assume that you don't have the
cash<00:02:23.410> now<00:02:23.650> but<00:02:23.980> in<00:02:24.160> the<00:02:24.190> future<00:02:24.340> you<00:02:24.730> want<00:02:24.880> to

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
cash now but in the future you want to

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.160 
cash now but in the future you want to
let's<00:02:25.900> say<00:02:26.110> go<00:02:26.590> crossfire<00:02:27.540> well<00:02:28.540> the<00:02:28.900> great

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
let's say go crossfire well the great

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.280 
let's say go crossfire well the great
news<00:02:29.200> is<00:02:29.500> then<00:02:30.070> that's<00:02:30.340> absolutely<00:02:30.850> fine<00:02:31.290> you

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
news is then that's absolutely fine you

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.170 
news is then that's absolutely fine you
can<00:02:32.530> pair<00:02:33.490> up<00:02:33.790> a<00:02:34.120> 7970<00:02:35.080> we<00:02:35.290> say<00:02:35.530> that<00:02:35.860> r9<00:02:36.370> 280x

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
can pair up a 7970 we say that r9 280x

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.949 
can pair up a 7970 we say that r9 280x
and<00:02:37.750> they<00:02:37.990> work<00:02:38.320> fine<00:02:39.250> i<00:02:39.730> don't<00:02:40.390> know<00:02:40.720> if<00:02:40.840> it's

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
and they work fine i don't know if it's

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.680 
and they work fine i don't know if it's
officially<00:02:41.560> a<00:02:41.590> dorste<00:02:42.070> but<00:02:42.760> unofficially<00:02:43.540> it

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
officially a dorste but unofficially it

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.510 
officially a dorste but unofficially it
works<00:02:44.020> flawlessly<00:02:44.260> from<00:02:44.950> what<00:02:45.160> we're<00:02:45.340> reading

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
works flawlessly from what we're reading

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.740 
works flawlessly from what we're reading
and<00:02:46.230> just<00:02:47.230> for<00:02:47.350> example<00:02:47.860> in<00:02:48.070> one<00:02:48.370> test<00:02:48.750> they

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
and just for example in one test they

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.580 
and just for example in one test they
showed<00:02:50.230> that<00:02:50.770> a<00:02:50.980> single<00:02:51.340> up<00:02:51.790> to<00:02:52.270> 80<00:02:52.510> x<00:02:52.900> running

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
showed that a single up to 80 x running

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799

however with a second graphics card it

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.850 
however with a second graphics card it
goes<00:03:21.820> pretty<00:03:22.510> much<00:03:22.750> doubles<00:03:23.200> the<00:03:23.380> frame<00:03:23.620> rate

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
goes pretty much doubles the frame rate

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.680 
goes pretty much doubles the frame rate
to<00:03:24.040> one<00:03:24.130> hundred<00:03:24.220> and<00:03:24.459> two<00:03:24.760> point<00:03:25.510> three

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
frames per second and the card does

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.920 
frames per second and the card does
function<00:03:30.489> pretty<00:03:30.700> much<00:03:30.940> exactly<00:03:31.420> how<00:03:31.630> you'd

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
function pretty much exactly how you'd

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.250 
function pretty much exactly how you'd
expect<00:03:32.440> it<00:03:32.650> in<00:03:32.830> other<00:03:33.250> words<00:03:33.459> it<00:03:34.299> shuts<00:03:35.170> down

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
expect it in other words it shuts down

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.979 
expect it in other words it shuts down
the<00:03:35.530> second<00:03:35.890> card<00:03:36.160> if<00:03:36.430> it's<00:03:36.640> not<00:03:36.850> in<00:03:36.940> use<00:03:37.239> which

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
the second card if it's not in use which

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.470 
the second card if it's not in use which
is<00:03:38.290> pretty<00:03:38.680> much<00:03:38.920> the<00:03:38.980> zero<00:03:39.580> core<00:03:39.880> technology

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
is pretty much the zero core technology

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.780 
is pretty much the zero core technology
of<00:03:40.540> AMD<00:03:41.049> so<00:03:41.650> it's<00:03:41.860> all<00:03:42.010> pretty<00:03:42.280> awesome<00:03:42.700> in

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
of AMD so it's all pretty awesome in

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.270 
of AMD so it's all pretty awesome in
that<00:03:42.880> respect<00:03:43.360> what's<00:03:44.350> that<00:03:44.470> good<00:03:44.799> sir<00:03:45.070> you

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
that respect what's that good sir you

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
want more information well the great

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.590 
want more information well the great
news<00:03:48.160> is<00:03:48.430> that<00:03:50.070> well<00:03:51.070> the<00:03:51.730> next<00:03:51.910> generation

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
news is that well the next generation

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.130 
news is that well the next generation
cards<00:03:53.019> that<00:03:53.610> 290<00:03:54.610> and<00:03:54.760> the<00:03:54.850> 290x<00:03:55.510> are<00:03:55.810> going<00:03:56.049> to

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
cards that 290 and the 290x are going to

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.170 
cards that 290 and the 290x are going to
be<00:03:56.230> coming<00:03:56.260> out<00:03:56.680> some<00:03:56.980> point<00:03:57.220> this<00:03:57.340> year<00:03:57.400> that

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
be coming out some point this year that

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.050 
be coming out some point this year that
also<00:03:58.540> of<00:03:58.660> course<00:03:58.930> explains<00:03:59.500> why<00:04:00.010> those<00:04:00.519> cards

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.060 
also of course explains why those cards

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.740 
also of course explains why those cards
are<00:04:01.180> what<00:04:01.780> features<00:04:02.350> the<00:04:02.530> new<00:04:03.420> DSP<00:04:04.420> the<00:04:04.630> new

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
are what features the new DSP the new

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.900 
are what features the new DSP the new
audio<00:04:05.110> DSP<00:04:05.680> on<00:04:05.890> them<00:04:06.220> rather<00:04:06.459> than<00:04:06.610> or

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
audio DSP on them rather than or

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.900 
audio DSP on them rather than or
generation<00:04:08.130> so<00:04:09.130> I<00:04:09.160> guess<00:04:09.400> we're<00:04:09.610> just<00:04:09.640> gonna

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
generation so I guess we're just gonna

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.900 
generation so I guess we're just gonna
have<00:04:10.030> to<00:04:10.360> see<00:04:10.630> I'm<00:04:11.170> not<00:04:11.380> particularly<00:04:12.160> a<00:04:12.400> fan

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
have to see I'm not particularly a fan

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:14.190 
have to see I'm not particularly a fan
of<00:04:12.970> the<00:04:13.329> fact<00:04:13.540> that<00:04:13.600> aimed<00:04:13.810> you've<00:04:14.079> actually

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
of the fact that aimed you've actually

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.789 
of the fact that aimed you've actually
done<00:04:14.440> this<00:04:15.329> rebranding<00:04:16.329> on<00:04:16.959> so<00:04:17.229> if<00:04:17.350> I<00:04:17.440> can<00:04:17.560> spit

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
done this rebranding on so if I can spit

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.880 
done this rebranding on so if I can spit
the<00:04:17.829> words<00:04:18.130> out<00:04:18.400> in

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 
the words out in

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.230 
the words out in
something<00:04:21.890> that<00:04:22.040> the<00:04:22.220> video<00:04:22.520> did<00:04:22.760> a<00:04:22.790> couple<00:04:23.060> of

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
something that the video did a couple of

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:27.940 
something that the video did a couple of
times<00:04:23.420> as<00:04:23.690> well<00:04:23.960> and<00:04:26.050> and<00:04:27.050> I<00:04:27.500> kind<00:04:27.740> of<00:04:27.770> don't

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
times as well and and I kind of don't

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.130 
times as well and and I kind of don't
like<00:04:28.250> it<00:04:28.520> if<00:04:28.730> I'm<00:04:29.240> honest<00:04:29.570> from<00:04:29.840> a<00:04:29.930> very

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.140 
like it if I'm honest from a very

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:34.300 
like it if I'm honest from a very
neutral<00:04:30.830> perspective<00:04:31.250> for<00:04:31.700> example<00:04:32.300> the<00:04:33.310> 482

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
neutral perspective for example the 482

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.980 
neutral perspective for example the 482
the<00:04:34.670> 580<00:04:35.210> that's<00:04:35.630> the<00:04:35.990> video<00:04:36.260> cards<00:04:37.990> there

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
the 580 that's the video cards there

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.820 
the 580 that's the video cards there
were<00:04:39.080> a<00:04:39.110> few<00:04:39.380> differences<00:04:39.980> for<00:04:40.310> example<00:04:40.370> they

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
were a few differences for example they

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.740 
were a few differences for example they
unlocked<00:04:42.830> more<00:04:43.820> of<00:04:43.910> the<00:04:44.000> cause<00:04:44.210> because<00:04:44.480> they

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
unlocked more of the cause because they

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.680 
unlocked more of the cause because they
got<00:04:44.960> better<00:04:45.850> manufacturing<00:04:46.850> processes<00:04:47.450> down

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:47.690 
got better manufacturing processes down

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.920 
got better manufacturing processes down
by<00:04:47.960> that<00:04:48.170> point<00:04:48.550> but<00:04:49.780> there<00:04:50.780> have<00:04:50.900> been

the<00:04:56.380> hardware<00:04:57.380> enthusiasts<00:04:58.160> have<00:04:58.250> kind<00:04:58.460> of

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
the hardware enthusiasts have kind of

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.880 
the hardware enthusiasts have kind of
gone<00:04:58.730> them<00:04:59.000> for<00:04:59.210> that<00:04:59.330> I<00:04:59.620> personally<00:05:00.620> don't

really<00:05:01.160> like<00:05:01.490> how<00:05:01.760> close<00:05:02.150> the<00:05:02.360> numbering

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
really like how close the numbering

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.230 
really like how close the numbering
system<00:05:03.050> is<00:05:03.430> because<00:05:04.430> i<00:05:04.520> think<00:05:04.580> it's<00:05:04.910> not

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
system is because i think it's not

system is because i think it's not

pretty damn sure I'm correct on this you
will<00:06:07.190> soon<00:06:07.640> be<00:06:07.940> able<00:06:08.060> to<00:06:08.270> utilize<00:06:08.720> battlefield

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:09.260 
will soon be able to utilize battlefield

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.440 
will soon be able to utilize battlefield
I<00:06:09.350> think<00:06:09.620> it's<00:06:09.770> in<00:06:09.980> like<00:06:10.190> late<00:06:10.580> November<00:06:11.210> /

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:11.450 
I think it's in like late November /

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:13.390 
I think it's in like late November /
early<00:06:11.840> December<00:06:12.350> by<00:06:12.500> believe<00:06:12.950> it's<00:06:13.190> late

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:13.400 
early December by believe it's late

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.230 
early December by believe it's late
November<00:06:13.970> you<00:06:14.510> will<00:06:14.750> be<00:06:14.900> able<00:06:15.020> to<00:06:15.170> use<00:06:16.240> mantle

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.240 
November you will be able to use mantle

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.300 
November you will be able to use mantle
with<00:06:17.570> battlefield<00:06:17.930> and<00:06:18.380> it<00:06:18.590> you'll<00:06:18.830> be<00:06:19.010> fine

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:19.310 
with battlefield and it you'll be fine

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:21.160 
with battlefield and it you'll be fine
and<00:06:19.520> you<00:06:19.610> will<00:06:19.820> get<00:06:20.000> even<00:06:20.150> higher<00:06:20.480> performance

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:21.170 
and you will get even higher performance

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:23.320 
and you will get even higher performance
so<00:06:21.980> hopefully<00:06:22.550> that's<00:06:22.760> cleared<00:06:23.090> everything

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:23.330 
so hopefully that's cleared everything

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.870 
so hopefully that's cleared everything
up<00:06:23.540> for<00:06:23.720> everyone<00:06:24.430> so<00:06:25.430> I'm<00:06:25.520> going<00:06:25.670> to<00:06:25.700> get
