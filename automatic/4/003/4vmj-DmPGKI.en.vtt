00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.710
 on the subject of the tribes none of that and 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.809
 I do not know anything or how it goes or anything like that 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.430
 yesterday on twitter I asked how to create 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.050
 kids and all of it and there will be is that as 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.300
 many people that more line that kill me 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.010
 the things to the helicopter gave like 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.110
 I say because we can not enter uncle good 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.090
 I do not know why I asked you how 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.350
 make the criticisms and all that subject and what 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.030
 You will see that there were many people by the way 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.469
 take out a car that I explain and 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.600
 taiwan or if they do not run over me if I can 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.860
 take out the car and as I say then 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.260
 verify a point to exercise how 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.520
 make a crisis and in the end then I the 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.570
 I ended up creating and I ended up going well 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.890
 I wanted to create a screen for all 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.449
 subscribers so you can play the 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.830
 most people with me then 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.700
 with me I stayed I create a tribe 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.729
 latent 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.780
 the description and then all the 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.430
 people who are on that cross because according to 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.539
 I understand when I go to play 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.340
 me that is a game to death a 

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:15.689
 I race any of these things 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.979
 if I give to invite members of the 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.840
 sift everyone who is united to me 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.789
 cross then automatically send you a 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.200
 notification and then well although not 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:23.310
 you have me added to the prison 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.689
 you can join what comes to be the 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.100
 heading then then but it's a 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.689
 pretty pretty cool tool for 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.090
 all the subscribers and such and really 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.159
 I do not know what is the limit of some of 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.360
 people who can scale in the crew and 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.100
 He told me that they told me 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.719
 can increase something so if you know 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.009
 more or less like to write all that 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:40.259
 issue if someone leaves me down there 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.000

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.409

 time there are so many 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:31.709
 So it is very clear that everything follows me and 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:33.120

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:51.720
