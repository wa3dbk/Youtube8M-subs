hey guys welcome back to my channel
I<00:00:04.710> always<00:00:05.490> feel<00:00:05.700> awkward<00:00:05.819> for<00:00:06.240> saying<00:00:06.450> that

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
I always feel awkward for saying that

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.330 
I always feel awkward for saying that
but<00:00:07.519> my<00:00:08.519> previous<00:00:09.120> video<00:00:09.420> was<00:00:10.340> basically

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
but my previous video was basically

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.430 
but my previous video was basically
introducing<00:00:12.049> myself<00:00:13.049> as<00:00:13.559> well<00:00:13.830> as<00:00:14.070> what<00:00:15.440> my

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
introducing myself as well as what my

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.010 
introducing myself as well as what my
switcheroo<00:00:16.920> was<00:00:17.430> about<00:00:17.640> because<00:00:17.970> it<00:00:18.869> was

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
switcheroo was about because it was

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.950 
switcheroo was about because it was
originally<00:00:19.260> a<00:00:19.619> beauty<00:00:20.070> channel<00:00:20.490> but<00:00:20.960> thought

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
originally a beauty channel but thought

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.320 
originally a beauty channel but thought
I'd<00:00:22.080> changed<00:00:22.410> it<00:00:22.470> to<00:00:22.880> getting<00:00:23.880> fit<00:00:24.300> and

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
I'd changed it to getting fit and

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.150 
I'd changed it to getting fit and
healthy<00:00:24.869> in<00:00:25.019> bed<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.500> feeling<00:00:25.890> good<00:00:26.039> about

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
healthy in bed to feeling good about

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:33.340 
healthy in bed to feeling good about
myself<00:00:26.510> so<00:00:27.510> I<00:00:29.599> was<00:00:30.599> really<00:00:31.260> struggling<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:32.099> to

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
myself so I was really struggling it to

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.750 
myself so I was really struggling it to
post<00:00:34.350> this<00:00:34.590> video<00:00:34.800> because<00:00:35.219> this<00:00:36.059> is

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
post this video because this is

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.170 
post this video because this is
extremely<00:00:38.760> hard<00:00:39.120> for<00:00:39.329> me<00:00:39.450> I<00:00:39.719> do<00:00:40.620> not<00:00:40.800> like<00:00:41.760> my

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
extremely hard for me I do not like my

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.979 
extremely hard for me I do not like my
body<00:00:42.590> whatsoever<00:00:44.180> but<00:00:45.180> this<00:00:45.360> is<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.660> first

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
body whatsoever but this is the first

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.510
