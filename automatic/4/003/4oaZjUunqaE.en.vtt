a<00:00:38.739> little<00:00:39.010> bit<00:00:39.159> of<00:00:39.219> the<00:00:39.309> article<00:00:39.609> here<00:00:39.760> it's<00:00:39.850> on

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
a little bit of the article here it's on

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.049 
a little bit of the article here it's on
space<00:00:40.179> calm<00:00:40.600> but<00:00:41.699> apparently<00:00:42.699> this<00:00:42.789> was<00:00:42.909> from

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:43.059 
space calm but apparently this was from

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:44.849 
space calm but apparently this was from
a<00:00:43.120> Russian<00:00:43.479> missile<00:00:43.809> launch<00:00:44.019> so<00:00:44.409> basically

00:00:44.849 --> 00:00:44.859 
a Russian missile launch so basically

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:46.469 
a Russian missile launch so basically
that's<00:00:45.429> what<00:00:45.579> it<00:00:45.729> created<00:00:46.149> out<00:00:46.239> there<00:00:46.420> in

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:46.479 
that's what it created out there in

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:48.209 
that's what it created out there in
space<00:00:46.629> matching<00:00:47.530> not<00:00:47.649> really<00:00:47.859> knowing<00:00:48.039> what

00:00:48.209 --> 00:00:48.219 
space matching not really knowing what

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:50.160 
space matching not really knowing what
that<00:00:48.280> was<00:00:48.429> at<00:00:48.760> the<00:00:48.850> time<00:00:49.059> so<00:00:49.420> I'll<00:00:49.809> be<00:00:49.929> just<00:00:50.079> a

didn't<00:01:14.110> know<00:01:14.170> what<00:01:14.290> it<00:01:14.410> was<00:01:14.590> and<00:01:15.010> it<00:01:15.040> turned

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
didn't know what it was and it turned

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:16.920 
didn't know what it was and it turned
out<00:01:15.400> to<00:01:15.460> be<00:01:15.670> this<00:01:15.790> missile<00:01:16.180> launch<00:01:16.360> here<00:01:16.600> from

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
out to be this missile launch here from

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.960 
out to be this missile launch here from
Russia<00:01:17.170> I'm<00:01:17.800> going<00:01:18.010> to<00:01:18.070> link<00:01:18.370> this<00:01:18.520> article

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
Russia I'm going to link this article

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.340 
Russia I'm going to link this article
and<00:01:19.090> check<00:01:19.240> that<00:01:19.390> out<00:01:19.450> i<00:01:19.630> guess<00:01:19.960> it's<00:01:20.170> cool

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
and check that out i guess it's cool

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:21.780 
and check that out i guess it's cool
because<00:01:20.500> as<00:01:20.710> the<00:01:20.740> missile<00:01:21.160> launched<00:01:21.490> it<00:01:21.610> went

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
because as the missile launched it went

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.300 
because as the missile launched it went
up<00:01:21.880> and<00:01:22.060> left<00:01:22.180> that<00:01:22.390> really<00:01:22.870> that<00:01:23.680> contrail

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
up and left that really that contrail

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.090 
up and left that really that contrail
that<00:01:24.900> circular<00:01:25.900> type<00:01:26.140> contrail<00:01:26.680> and<00:01:26.860> as<00:01:26.950> it

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
that circular type contrail and as it

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.170 
that circular type contrail and as it
got<00:01:27.250> up<00:01:27.660> that's<00:01:28.660> pretty<00:01:28.930> neat<00:01:29.730> it<00:01:30.730> got<00:01:31.000> that

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
got up that's pretty neat it got that

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.760 
got up that's pretty neat it got that
weird<00:01:31.420> eerie<00:01:31.780> cloud<00:01:32.140> I<00:01:32.170> get<00:01:32.500> to<00:01:32.590> just

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
weird eerie cloud I get to just

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.360 
weird eerie cloud I get to just
continued<00:01:33.280> right<00:01:33.460> on<00:01:33.610> into<00:01:33.760> space<00:01:34.170> so

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:35.370 
continued right on into space so

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.650 
continued right on into space so

man<00:01:44.290> so<00:01:44.590> I<00:01:44.620> guess<00:01:44.860> that<00:01:44.890> Twitter's<00:01:45.790> is<00:01:46.000> one<00:01:46.180> of

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
man so I guess that Twitter's is one of

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:47.340 
man so I guess that Twitter's is one of
the<00:01:46.330> things<00:01:46.510> they<00:01:46.630> can<00:01:46.780> do<00:01:46.900> right<00:01:47.050> now<00:01:47.080> they

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
the things they can do right now they

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.270 
the things they can do right now they
don't<00:01:47.380> have<00:01:47.500> to<00:01:47.770> can't<00:01:47.950> talk<00:01:48.100> to<00:01:48.220> the

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
don't have to can't talk to the

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.460 
don't have to can't talk to the
high-techs<00:01:48.790> right<00:01:49.000> now<00:01:49.180> but<00:01:49.570> they<00:01:50.290> could

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
high-techs right now but they could

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.050 
high-techs right now but they could
still<00:01:50.500> do<00:01:50.800> Twitter<00:01:51.100> and<00:01:51.310> stuff<00:01:51.400> like<00:01:51.670> that<00:01:51.730> up
