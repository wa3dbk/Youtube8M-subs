00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.680 

you

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:27.690 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:35.490 

let's<00:00:28.620> now<00:00:28.740> rely<00:00:29.100> on<00:00:29.340> latest

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:35.500 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.100 

that's<00:00:36.500> the<00:00:36.649> third<00:00:36.890> one<00:00:37.510> that's<00:00:38.510> a<00:00:38.600> third<00:00:38.780> clip

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
that's the third one that's a third clip

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.520 
that's the third one that's a third clip
okay<00:00:39.649> so<00:00:40.040> the<00:00:40.129> question<00:00:40.460> was<00:00:40.719> why<00:00:41.719> tune<00:00:42.350> these

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
okay so the question was why tune these

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.889 
okay so the question was why tune these
things<00:00:42.829> in<00:00:43.010> G<00:00:43.370> so<00:00:44.120> I<00:00:44.180> keep<00:00:44.390> mechanical<00:00:44.960> and

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:46.899 
things in G so I keep mechanical and

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:48.970 
things in G so I keep mechanical and
basically<00:00:47.899> it<00:00:48.050> doesn't<00:00:48.290> have<00:00:48.410> to<00:00:48.559> be<00:00:48.589> G<00:00:48.829> could

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
basically it doesn't have to be G could

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.600 
basically it doesn't have to be G could
be<00:00:49.040> any<00:00:49.219> chord<00:00:49.870> but<00:00:51.159> the<00:00:52.159> reason<00:00:52.309> for<00:00:52.519> doing

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
be any chord but the reason for doing

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:53.979 
be any chord but the reason for doing
that<00:00:52.790> is<00:00:52.909> when<00:00:53.239> you're<00:00:53.360> using<00:00:53.570> one<00:00:53.809> of<00:00:53.839> these

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
that is when you're using one of these

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.030 
that is when you're using one of these
things<00:00:54.320> here<00:00:54.589> which<00:00:55.399> is<00:00:55.579> a<00:00:55.640> brass<00:00:55.940> slide<00:00:57.040> it

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.040 
things here which is a brass slide it

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.030 
things here which is a brass slide it
makes<00:00:58.250> it<00:00:58.370> easier<00:00:58.760> to<00:00:58.879> accompany<00:00:59.570> people

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.040 
makes it easier to accompany people

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:14.580 
makes it easier to accompany people
thinking<00:01:01.040> here<00:01:01.250> not<00:01:01.399> cord<00:01:01.640> there

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.679 

so<00:01:15.590> instead<00:01:15.829> of<00:01:15.890> forming<00:01:16.340> cords<00:01:17.299> as<00:01:17.479> you

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:17.689 
so instead of forming cords as you

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:19.950 
so instead of forming cords as you
normally<00:01:17.930> would<00:01:18.200> Richard<00:01:18.710> involves<00:01:19.189> of

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
normally would Richard involves of

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.300 
normally would Richard involves of
arrangement<00:01:20.960> of<00:01:21.049> fingers<00:01:21.590> doesn't<00:01:21.950> work<00:01:22.070> as

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
arrangement of fingers doesn't work as

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.100 
arrangement of fingers doesn't work as
this<00:01:22.430> is<00:01:22.579> d<00:01:22.729> qu<00:01:22.939> in<00:01:24.640> various<00:01:25.640> shapes<00:01:25.719> and<00:01:26.719> bars

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
this is d qu in various shapes and bars

00:01:27.110 --> 00:02:11.160 
this is d qu in various shapes and bars
this

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.400 

the<00:02:12.170> reason<00:02:12.410> for<00:02:12.440> using<00:02:12.650> this<00:02:12.950> brass<00:02:13.370> one<00:02:14.410> it's

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
the reason for using this brass one it's

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.470 
the reason for using this brass one it's
a<00:02:15.650> it's<00:02:15.920> quite<00:02:16.099> heavy<00:02:16.280> a<00:02:16.580> metallic<00:02:17.150> and<00:02:17.390> he

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
a it's quite heavy a metallic and he

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.620 
a it's quite heavy a metallic and he
gives<00:02:18.019> our<00:02:18.700> gives<00:02:19.700> quite<00:02:19.850> a<00:02:19.910> bit<00:02:20.090> of<00:02:20.180> sustained

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
gives our gives quite a bit of sustained

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.580 
gives our gives quite a bit of sustained
because<00:02:20.900> these<00:02:21.110> guitars<00:02:21.350> are<00:02:21.650> quite<00:02:21.799> punchy

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
because these guitars are quite punchy

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.140 
because these guitars are quite punchy
goal<00:02:24.590> of<00:02:24.860> sustained<00:02:27.489> if<00:02:28.489> you<00:02:28.610> give<00:02:28.790> her<00:02:28.880> a<00:02:28.910> bit

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
goal of sustained if you give her a bit

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.090 
goal of sustained if you give her a bit
of<00:02:29.239> a<00:02:29.299> wild

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:50.260 

you

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.630 

now<00:02:51.200> what<00:02:51.410> she's<00:02:51.590> in<00:02:51.710> a<00:02:51.800> glass<00:02:52.040> line<00:02:52.310> for<00:02:52.490> a<00:02:52.520> bit

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
now what she's in a glass line for a bit

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:53.860 
now what she's in a glass line for a bit
where<00:02:52.790> they're<00:02:52.970> a<00:02:53.000> bit<00:02:53.180> lighter<00:02:53.450> than<00:02:53.690> this

where they're a bit lighter than this

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.650 
where they're a bit lighter than this
and<00:02:54.080> they<00:02:54.200> don't<00:02:54.410> term<00:02:55.180> and<00:02:56.180> I<00:02:56.270> give<00:02:56.540> the

and<00:03:37.250> which<00:03:37.819> is<00:03:37.970> great<00:03:38.150> for<00:03:38.180> normal<00:03:38.660> plane

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.800 

you

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.630 

as<00:03:50.810> you<00:03:50.930> can<00:03:51.050> see<00:03:51.230> the<00:03:51.350> fingers<00:03:51.860> my<00:03:52.610> fingers

as you can see the fingers my fingers

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.610 
as you can see the fingers my fingers
are<00:03:53.060> all<00:03:53.150> over<00:03:53.270> the<00:03:53.420> place<00:03:53.600> so<00:03:54.320> one<00:03:54.470> arm

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
are all over the place so one arm

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.649 
there's a sort of slightly technical
reason<00:04:58.009> for<00:04:58.129> tuning<00:04:58.400> in<00:04:58.490> G<00:04:58.789> what<00:04:59.030> why<00:04:59.270> I<00:04:59.300> like

00:04:59.649 --> 00:04:59.659 
reason for tuning in G what why I like

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:04.779 
reason for tuning in G what why I like
it<00:04:59.690> G<00:05:00.310> it's<00:05:01.310> a<00:05:01.430> lot<00:05:01.610> of<00:05:01.789> the<00:05:03.400> that's<00:05:04.400> quite<00:05:04.610> hear

it G it's a lot of the that's quite hear
the<00:05:04.909> notes<00:05:05.120> are<00:05:05.270> the<00:05:05.360> same<00:05:05.569> as<00:05:05.780> then<00:05:05.930> ordinary

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 
the notes are the same as then ordinary

the notes are the same as then ordinary
open<00:05:06.889> tuning<00:05:07.310> as<00:05:07.430> this<00:05:07.610> tube<00:05:09.610> so<00:05:10.610> it's<00:05:10.729> not<00:05:10.879> so

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
open tuning as this tube so it's not so

but<00:05:24.409> um<00:05:24.800> the<00:05:25.669> reason<00:05:25.789> for<00:05:26.030> doing<00:05:26.150> that<00:05:26.300> is<00:05:26.419> when

you're<00:05:26.900> using<00:05:27.080> one<00:05:27.319> of<00:05:27.349> these<00:05:27.500> things<00:05:27.830> here

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270 
she's a brass slide it makes it easier

she's a brass slide it makes it easier
to<00:05:32.419> accompany<00:05:33.080> people<00:05:33.550> thinking<00:05:34.550> here<00:05:34.759> not
