00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.450
 for training 

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:25.249
 but still with the room 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.710
 the room is higher we have Zurich 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.810
 Riedmiller units when they move on the net 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.470
 and come now like that 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.470
 Nobody like Annie Data 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.110
 it comes to the conclusion it is scary 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.680
 Online graphically dry 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.170
 I'm still playing at the moment 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.070
 the flakes 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.280
 because the Su's stupid Rumba land 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.899
 and promptly is not so possible the big game room 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.570
 even if I personally would the promotion 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.229
 in principle, there are two different modes, they sing well for me 

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:14.849
 Do not expect to take advantage of everything Â»or Bucher 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:18.119
 Aim of all humility Unum ship is on the move 

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:21.149
 and missions 

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:22.539
 Flight makes 

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:25.619
 and there are the modes 

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:28.909
 like here 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:31.909
 is traveling on stations and 

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:36.859
 because of the world history Basler that one must of Albersloh 

00:02:39.779 --> 00:02:42.349
 finally it is there 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:44.739
 Philipp Wanner continues 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.739
 from Valeska skills 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.959
 Surely this is certainly really good player's interest 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:55.549
 but for people who 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:58.079
 Of course not to start loading and 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:00.359
 by Ulrich Fischer are now enthusiastic 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:02.419
 the last minute to bring others 

00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:05.419
 I prefer to play the rule 

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:07.079
 to 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:10.099
 This just does not play well enough 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:13.029
 you have to say so hard 

00:03:13.029 --> 00:03:15.299
 how it is 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:18.209
 we hope therefore still a lot 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.389
 In the near future it will be definitely 

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:22.849
 observe 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:27.579
 In the meantime, try it yourself and play it should be on 13 drew 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:31.509
 listen to me in the CLS Meckelein 

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:33.559
 because there lost between Neuss and 

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:36.109

 Acquisition Costs "At the moment, we're about to cost 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.359
