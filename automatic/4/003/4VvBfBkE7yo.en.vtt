 rio de janeiro more than 200 thousand people 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:16.240
 live in cities that border the river

 dove river dove in the season of forts 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:22.870
 the cities of slab of the muriaé 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.810
 it is so and so 

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:28.240
 Saint Anthony of Padua suffer from the 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:31.030
 frequent floods dislodging 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.970
 thousands of families leaving cities 

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:37.350
 in a state of public calamity and 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:40.990
 causing enormous social losses 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:43.180
 economic and environmental how it is 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:45.520
 the situation because the situation 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.530
 here is very serious because after all this 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.900
 bridge one of the city's main 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.000
 interdicted antonio of Padua more than 12 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.190
 thousand people are homeless 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.980
 muriaé rose further in the last 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:00.130
 hours to Peruvian the number of people out 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:04.299
 already of 5 thousand in slab of the 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:07.119
 Muriaé are more than 2,500 homeless 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:09.429
 to combat this problem, the government of 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:12.009
 state of rio de janeiro through the 

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:15.189
 environment secretary developed a 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:18.729
 large project of river interventions 

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:22.810
 mp Muriaé and dove all ceará 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:25.439
 region in the regions of the cities mentioned 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.609
 geological studies 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.209
 preliminary and withdrawals 

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:33.819
 topographic works for the implantation of works 

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:36.700
 structures such as dams and dams of 

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:38.969
 containment and diversion channels that 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:43.380
 protected cities from floods 

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:46.689
 for the recurrence time of 25 years 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.659
 in the municipality of slab of the muriaé the 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:52.659
 studies have determined that the best solution is 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:55.959
 the implementation of a dam with a 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:59.049
 of 181 meters in length and 23 meters 

00:01:55.959 --> 00:02:02.549
 of height this dam will have capacity 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:05.919
 of retaining 9.6 billion liters of water 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:09.009
 in rainy seasons the dam will 

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:11.830
 regulate the water flow ensuring that the 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:16.600
 river runs normally in its bed 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:19.390
 the excess volume will be implanted 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.060
 also a deviation channel of 5.9 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:25.270
 kilometers with excavation of 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:29.620
 2.8 million cubic meters including 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:33.070
 retaining dams curtain walls 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:38.080
 and bridging of two bridges in the 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:40.510
 356 in the dry season to 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.700
 reservoir may be 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.910
 used as irrigation in rural areas 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.590
 as well as reinforcing the supply of 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.870
 water in cities 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.520
 when filling the reservoir 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.820
 flood cushioning 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:57.370
 the water will follow the bypass channel 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:59.290
 thus keeping the entire urban area free 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.630
 of floods 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.420
 interventions will also be 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:07.209
 urban stretch of the slab of muriaé as the 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.080
 creation of hawk dams and dams of 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.050
 landfill 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.780
 along the river banks increasing 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:16.989
 flow capacity 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:20.250
 drainage and avoid erosion that may 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:20.250
 restrict the reader 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.560
 studies also showed that in the 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.280
 city ​​of Itapuna, works will be 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.380
 similar to the works of slab of the muriaé 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:36.340
 being the construction of a dam 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:39.880
 with a length of 271 meters and 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:43.420
 24 meters high capable of holding around 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:46.810
 14.6 billion liters of water one 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:50.170
 channel of 7.2 km from 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:53.310
 with an excavation of 1.5 million 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:56.980
 cubic meters and containment dikes 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:59.140
 reinforced curtain wall 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.890
 construction of two bridges and a tunnel 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:05.260
 excavated in rock with extension of 1,2 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:09.409
 kilometers and total excavation volume 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:12.420
 of 170 thousand public meters 

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:14.849
 the dam when regulating the flow of water 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.329
 who arrives in the city in 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:19.709
 flood damper reservoir 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:22.290
 allowing the use of this water to 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.570
 irrigation of rural areas in the 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:26.010
 of droughts and for reinforcement in the 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:29.070
 of water 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:32.190
 if the volume is excessive water 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:36.690
 follow up the bypass channel maintaining 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:39.210
 every city free of flood in the stretch 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:42.389
 of the island of 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:44.460
 the following interventions in works for 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:46.949
 increase the flow of river waters 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:50.780
 with the construction of dykes of 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:50.780
 champion and landfill tips 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:12.790
 already in the city of italva the interventions 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:15.340
 planned are the following regularization 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:17.979
 the urban stretch of the river through 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:31.240
 implantation of dikes of gabion dikes 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:34.690
 landfill and dredging to regularize the 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:37.510
 its bed increasing the speed of 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:43.180
 drainage and avoid erosion that may 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:45.850
 restrict the bed in the city of cardoso 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:48.220
 moreira the regularization of the urban stretch 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:06:01.120
 will also count on the construction of 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:06:05.370
 dykes of gabion embankment dikes and 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.370
 dredging of a riverbed session 

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:16.800
 in santo antônio de pádua city ​​bathed 

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:19.290
 by the river dove 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.610
 interventions will also be 

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:22.980
 its urban stretch 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:26.220
 counting on the construction of 

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:29.280
 hawk landfill dams beyond dredging 

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:31.640
 of an extensive stretch along the bed 

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:31.640
 From Rio 

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:42.480
 the flood mitigation project of the 

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:44.010
 muriae and pump rivers is essential and 

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:46.620
 fundamental to solve 

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:49.800
 definitely the problem of floods and 

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:53.130
 floods in the regions mentioned here 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:55.740
 with a budget estimated at around 602 

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:59.430
 million and an execution deadline 

00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:02.250
 approximately 24 months 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:05.430
 the project demonstrates the great concern 

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:08.070
 social and environmental aspects of the state 

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:12.470
 Rio de Janeiro with the population of 

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:12.470
 north and northwest of the state
