this rom and I have no idea what the

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:54.580 
this rom and I have no idea what the
issue<00:03:48.540> is

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.900 

you<00:03:55.590> know<00:03:55.650> it's<00:03:55.830> I'll<00:03:56.310> grab<00:03:56.610> a<00:03:56.730> you're<00:03:56.850> gonna

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
you know it's I'll grab a you're gonna

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.890 
you know it's I'll grab a you're gonna
figure<00:03:57.180> out<00:03:57.300> what's<00:03:57.480> going<00:03:57.690> on

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.560 

well<00:04:00.900> I<00:04:01.230> actually<00:04:01.590> did<00:04:02.100> some<00:04:02.280> research<00:04:02.760> and<00:04:03.000> I

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
well I actually did some research and I

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.260 
well I actually did some research and I
guess<00:04:03.960> obtaining<00:04:04.740> the<00:04:04.890> last<00:04:05.340> dispatch<00:04:05.940> to<00:04:06.240> a

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:06.270 
guess obtaining the last dispatch to a

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.260 
guess obtaining the last dispatch to a
swatch<00:04:06.810> is<00:04:07.080> just<00:04:07.320> in<00:04:07.500> theta<00:04:08.060> because<00:04:09.060> I<00:04:09.180> know

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:09.270 
swatch is just in theta because I know

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.480 
swatch is just in theta because I know
for<00:04:09.780> a<00:04:09.810> fact<00:04:10.140> if<00:04:10.470> you<00:04:10.620> go<00:04:10.920> into<00:04:11.190> this<00:04:11.310> area

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.490 
for a fact if you go into this area

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:13.130 
for a fact if you go into this area
because<00:04:12.000> I<00:04:12.090> searched<00:04:12.330> it<00:04:12.540> and<00:04:12.630> you<00:04:12.780> actually

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
because I searched it and you actually

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.190 
because I searched it and you actually
use<00:04:13.260> a<00:04:13.290> gameshark<00:04:13.770> to<00:04:13.920> remove<00:04:14.400> these<00:04:15.090> rocks<00:04:15.870> by

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
use a gameshark to remove these rocks by

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.350 
use a gameshark to remove these rocks by
getting<00:04:16.470> hmm<00:04:16.739> strength<00:04:17.100> early<00:04:17.519> you<00:04:18.209> can

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:18.360 
getting hmm strength early you can

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:22.910 
getting hmm strength early you can
access<00:04:18.750> up<00:04:18.989> those<00:04:19.230> but<00:04:19.650> I<00:04:20.900> just<00:04:21.900> simply<00:04:22.019> can't

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:22.920 
access up those but I just simply can't

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.610 
access up those but I just simply can't
do<00:04:23.130> that<00:04:23.250> I<00:04:23.520> mean<00:04:23.760> of<00:04:24.600> course<00:04:24.870> I<00:04:25.140> could<00:04:25.410> go

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
do that I mean of course I could go

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.160 
do that I mean of course I could go
there<00:04:25.800> and<00:04:25.950> show<00:04:26.160> it<00:04:26.370> I<00:04:26.610> mean<00:04:27.510> I<00:04:27.750> would<00:04:27.990> be<00:04:28.110> the

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.170 
there and show it I mean I would be the

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:29.930 
there and show it I mean I would be the
only<00:04:28.350> one<00:04:28.560> showing<00:04:28.800> it<00:04:29.070> but<00:04:29.280> it's<00:04:29.550> against<00:04:29.880> my

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
only one showing it but it's against my

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.010 
only one showing it but it's against my
principles<00:04:30.120> like<00:04:31.640> what<00:04:32.640> I<00:04:32.670> do<00:04:32.790> in<00:04:33.240> terms<00:04:33.300> of

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
principles like what I do in terms of

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.560 
principles like what I do in terms of
hacking<00:04:34.380> is<00:04:34.560> just<00:04:35.280> done<00:04:35.490> to<00:04:35.640> save<00:04:35.910> time<00:04:36.240> and

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
hacking is just done to save time and

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.870 
hacking is just done to save time and
with<00:04:36.870> saving<00:04:37.260> time<00:04:37.440> means<00:04:37.740> that<00:04:37.950> I<00:04:38.070> use<00:04:38.520> it<00:04:38.730> to

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
with saving time means that I use it to

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.300 
with saving time means that I use it to

if all your own train evey strain
IVs<00:04:41.780> all<00:04:42.780> those<00:04:43.110> values<00:04:43.380> I<00:04:43.740> train<00:04:44.070> them<00:04:44.310> to

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
IVs all those values I train them to

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.850 
IVs all those values I train them to
save<00:04:45.210> time<00:04:45.540> but<00:04:45.750> I<00:04:45.810> do<00:04:45.930> not<00:04:46.140> hack<00:04:46.410> to<00:04:46.680> get

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
save time but I do not hack to get

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.440 
save time but I do not hack to get
further<00:04:47.070> in<00:04:47.250> the<00:04:47.280> game<00:04:47.370> without<00:04:47.610> access<00:04:48.150> to<00:04:48.180> it

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450 
further in the game without access to it

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:52.310 
further in the game without access to it
I<00:04:48.570> mean<00:04:48.720> that's<00:04:48.930> not<00:04:49.020> myself<00:04:49.880> so<00:04:50.990> that<00:04:51.990> booth

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
I mean that's not myself so that booth

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:53.990 
I mean that's not myself so that booth
actually<00:04:52.860> ends<00:04:53.160> a<00:04:53.190> lot<00:04:53.310> Slayer<00:04:53.550> 4<00:04:53.790> here<00:04:53.940> on

actually ends a lot Slayer 4 here on

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.750 
actually ends a lot Slayer 4 here on
skyline<00:04:54.600> but<00:04:55.020> I<00:04:55.320> will<00:04:55.560> leave<00:04:55.710> this<00:04:55.890> as<00:04:56.100> an<00:04:56.250> open

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.580 
skyline but I will leave this as an open
let's<00:04:56.970> play<00:04:57.240> as<00:04:57.450> soon<00:04:57.660> as<00:04:57.840> the<00:04:57.960> final<00:04:58.140> version

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
let's play as soon as the final version

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:59.840 
let's play as soon as the final version
is<00:04:58.650> getting<00:04:58.920> released<00:04:59.100> I<00:04:59.430> will<00:04:59.610> make<00:04:59.820> sure

00:04:59.840 --> 00:04:59.850 
is getting released I will make sure

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.900 
is getting released I will make sure
that<00:05:00.090> as<00:05:00.540> soon<00:05:00.600> as<00:05:00.870> I<00:05:01.770> get<00:05:02.010> access<00:05:02.310> to<00:05:02.520> it<00:05:02.790> I

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
that as soon as I get access to it I

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:05.630 
that as soon as I get access to it I
will<00:05:03.000> continue<00:05:03.750> from<00:05:04.050> this<00:05:04.230> point<00:05:04.640> hopefully

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:05.640 
will continue from this point hopefully

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.310 
will continue from this point hopefully
with<00:05:05.790> the<00:05:05.880> same<00:05:06.090> theme<00:05:06.330> if<00:05:06.600> I<00:05:06.690> have<00:05:06.780> to<00:05:06.900> restart

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
with the same theme if I have to restart

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.050 
with the same theme if I have to restart
and<00:05:07.530> you<00:05:07.680> might<00:05:07.860> have<00:05:08.040> some<00:05:08.310> needs<00:05:08.550> some<00:05:08.760> luck

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
and you might have some needs some luck

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.170 
and you might have some needs some luck
with<00:05:09.240> catching<00:05:09.630> what<00:05:09.720> I<00:05:09.750> got<00:05:10.430> but<00:05:11.430> in<00:05:11.910> that

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
with catching what I got but in that

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.960 
with catching what I got but in that
case<00:05:12.360> I'll<00:05:12.570> restart<00:05:12.870> from<00:05:12.990> this<00:05:13.169> area<00:05:13.470> and<00:05:13.970> go

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
case I'll restart from this area and go

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.240 
case I'll restart from this area and go
on<00:05:15.150> with<00:05:15.419> the<00:05:15.660> finished<00:05:16.230> beta<00:05:16.410> because<00:05:17.130> you

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250 
on with the finished beta because you

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:18.680 
on with the finished beta because you
can't<00:05:17.460> go<00:05:17.640> here<00:05:17.820> the<00:05:17.940> bridges<00:05:18.210> and<00:05:18.330> program

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
can't go here the bridges and program

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.960 
can't go here the bridges and program
surfing<00:05:19.169> doesn't<00:05:19.440> work<00:05:19.590> either<00:05:19.860> and<00:05:20.220> that

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:20.970 
surfing doesn't work either and that

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.180 
surfing doesn't work either and that
area<00:05:21.300> is<00:05:21.390> also<00:05:21.540> blocked<00:05:21.870> by<00:05:22.050> snorer<00:05:22.380> so<00:05:22.740> this

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
area is also blocked by snorer so this

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.070 
area is also blocked by snorer so this
