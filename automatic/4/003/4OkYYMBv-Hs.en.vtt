00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:11.700
 here we are back with this car 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.009
 new one that has got the new dlc the 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.929
 bank berthing is called karim kuruma yes 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.100
 I do not remember badly so what will you do that 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.630
 Mexico is from the same family as 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.039
 Karim reveals next that it has to be 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.980
 a kaka car but good, actually, not 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.720
 it's a good car but it's here 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.699
 aesthetically to see how I could remove 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.320
 that why things we can modify it if 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.150
 some little things and secret and some 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.460
 things like that then and the whole thing for 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.840
 tuning this car so let's go to the 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.800
 street this is the sports car to no 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.149
 be armored but well I think not 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.950
 has no good difference I think no 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.450
 they do not have any simply that the 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.500
 window are thus a little more armored and 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.180
 all the subject but at the time of your denying 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.040
 I think they are totally the same 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.750
 I think I believe if I do not leave the 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.190
 comments but let's give cane to 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.780
 see how we can have this car 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.280
 as we say do it aesthetically look 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.480
 this one can do more things because 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.230
 have mind joins another car that does not 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.460
 I know if you have seen the video 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.100

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.160
 this one but the bumper case now that 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.170
 we have here 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.030
 carbon splitter the carbon ones do not 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.960
 Like nothing I've always said I want 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.570
 mistrust contras but of color 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.040

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.210

 we have this that you want that is a 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:20.119
 capita away from the escape 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.590
 this much as I say ok we could 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.500

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:28.160

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.170
 oval escape this one is more I like it badly 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.060
 I do not know why it's worth classes we leave you 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.189
 like the lights we are going to put 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.479
 I do not read I do not put it I do not like to see 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.299
 the cars when they do not finish 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:42.600

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.619

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.320

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.130
 nothing hits a metallic but 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.789

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.970
 very very to wyoming notice that the lights 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.450
 of the new ones that appear as 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.530
 bad plastic toy typical 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.610
 with mother's purchase checks when 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.250
 small and they were bad plastic 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.140
 well, they are the light of the uncle is worth seeing 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.600
 if they saw more colors here the rosita 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.400
 This salmon is very handsome too 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.590
 which is also very cool to see the 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.460
 orange I also like a lot 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:26.570

 beautiful the legrand hostel and a lot 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.870
 of colors the blue this also remains 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.870
 with the red of the beginning 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:42.590
 the lime green 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:44.360
 with the torino with the torino red and I do not know 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.370
 what's going to happen with this color but I 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.630
 loved reading we stayed with this and 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.030
 now as secondary colors we go with 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.960
 another metallic since it is a new focus 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.100
 and white 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.530

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.080

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.120

 please look at the pretty beautiful and 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:17.270
 in addition the idiomatic jointly penalizes 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.530
 joint then has a word in red 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.450

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:22.639

 love how to be left guys to leave the 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:25.280
 comments appears just for me 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.380
 Sincerely, I've loved this one a lot 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.210
 it has been nothing being able to be text has been 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.639
 The whole truth is that I loved it 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.110
 studied this car is very good in 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:35.630
 a car that tells me so much really 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:37.910
 at the time of aesthetics for example the 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:39.659
 environment he massacred him with the massacre not the 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:43.509
 yesterday 

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:45.669
 calls me a lot more now the rays is 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:47.259
 time to see the car is ethically and 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:49.389
 you will know that it looks a little bit bulky 

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:51.520
 the front because it's cool is 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:53.830
 a little before a little high in my opinion 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:55.389
 and the back part a bit like that 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.490
 wide has the car in the back 

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:58.869
 this car and you can not imagine that the one 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:59.860
 this car with this back has 

00:05:58.869 --> 00:06:01.960
 a front like this one 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.789
 but a front as more less 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.619
 aerodynamic plus less aerodynamic 

00:06:03.789 --> 00:06:07.449
 good phrase danny but not at home is that 

00:06:05.619 --> 00:06:08.949
 the car is cool molas reminds me 

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:10.149
 totally to a car this hot 

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:12.099
 wheels as I said in the video 

00:06:10.149 --> 00:06:13.120
 introductory I went up yesterday but good 

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:17.589
 the case that is a car 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:22.749
 Well, I liked it very much but it's something 

00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:23.919
 original and different to this and see you 

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:26.069
 in the next video 

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:26.069
 goodbye 

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.330
 Y
