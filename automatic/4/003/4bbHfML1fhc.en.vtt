00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:20.560
 Hello dear tv viewer I am normal 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:22.450
 with the kyocera ricoh sweet fs10 61 dm and 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.930
 we want to line it up 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:30.400
 Fashion or dress fashion like it here 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:32.409
 very describes times for you test and 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.339
 I often have to illustrate this 

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:37.929
 a telephone a decibel knife here 

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:39.760
 installed there you can also see that 

00:00:37.929 --> 00:00:41.170
 the level here already turns me down 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.489
 could now just pure fountain 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:49.839
 and hello and then he strikes up 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:52.839
 Let's take a look at how decibel 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:54.760
 if he again like the pressure of the printer 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:57.339
 According to that, I can give it to you 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:00.359
 announce how loud or better go 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:03.010
 I hold again into the camera 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.839
 and start the print and then 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.399
 will we see how loud the 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.399
 printer is in normal condition 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:44.860
 in the top it was 70 decibels 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:49.150
 I could read that here for a moment 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:51.830
 and to preserve the 70 so maximum 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.820
 and now if we have the silent mode 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.280
 activate 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.500
 a press of a button is enough for this one 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.800
 small button and just print now 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:05.510
 again the same the same 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:07.250
 document and again we both sides 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.660
 want to save a bit of paper that 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.220
 is also a nice feature you have 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.310
 already seen is printed on both sides 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.310
 been 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.140
 the laser printer black and white that was 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.420
 now try it and we 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.060
 look briefly once again that 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.340
 we will use it more or more 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.600
 measure less 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:30.550
 Of course not very precise though 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.550
 Nevertheless, there is already a clue 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:03:03.730
 in the tip one wet 68 65 decibels 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.830
 Of course, no one is sitting so close to it 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.599
 the printer on it as I always tour 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.610
 That should be a bit further 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:11.800
 put away but still had one 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:15.370
 already heard that is a bit quieter 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.780
 and so it is already one 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.060
 very good feature when you are at home 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.519
 this printer has a little child 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.349
 maybe that's just sleeping and 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:26.650
 you do not want to wake it up or in one 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:28.840
 office environment sits very much where content 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.610
 the noise level is not so loud where 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.110
 you just stop there is always a consideration 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:36.519
 silent example in a library 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.950
 there we sit very many people only 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:40.690
 read and want to have your peace and quiet 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:44.380
 not permanently annoyed by a broker 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.790
 want to be this can you acquire 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.790
 if yes, just go to the shop with us 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:51.400
 google.de or yahoo.de more 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.410
 You will also find information there and 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.680
 otherwise wish you much fun if 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:59.049
 have ordered now and I'll say in 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.790
 Operation takes this little send 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:02.829
 printer which is also relatively cheap 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.859
 for a laser printer black and white 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:07.030
 full duplex 25 pages per second per 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:10.870
 minute per second 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:12.910
 quaid mode and so on and so forth and 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.430
 everything kyocera with the eco sys 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.570
 technology makes me think that 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.280
 also on our website 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:23.039
 Of course also commercially as commercial 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.039
 said on hiphop.de and hh.de 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:36.470
 dear online.de a trap
