00:02:05.489 --> 00:02:07.339 
levels can drop fast in kids faster than
adults<00:02:05.609> it<00:02:06.450> has<00:02:06.599> to<00:02:06.719> be<00:02:06.809> dealt<00:02:07.109> with<00:02:07.200> quickly

00:02:07.339 --> 00:02:07.349 
adults it has to be dealt with quickly

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:10.699 
adults it has to be dealt with quickly
to<00:02:08.069> avoid<00:02:08.190> neurological<00:02:09.119> complications<00:02:09.709> also

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
to avoid neurological complications also

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.410 
to avoid neurological complications also
any<00:02:10.979> loss<00:02:11.250> of<00:02:11.459> blood<00:02:11.700> in<00:02:11.849> a<00:02:11.939> child<00:02:12.209> during

any loss of blood in a child during

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.690 
any loss of blood in a child during
surgery<00:02:12.930> could<00:02:13.469> be<00:02:13.500> devastating<00:02:13.799> they<00:02:14.519> have<00:02:14.670> a

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
surgery could be devastating they have a

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.479 
surgery could be devastating they have a
smaller<00:02:15.060> blood<00:02:15.329> volume

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
smaller blood volume

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.210 
smaller blood volume
so<00:02:16.819> the<00:02:17.810> amount<00:02:18.110> of<00:02:18.200> loss<00:02:18.440> really<00:02:18.799> has<00:02:18.950> to<00:02:19.099> be

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
so the amount of loss really has to be

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.390 
so the amount of loss really has to be
