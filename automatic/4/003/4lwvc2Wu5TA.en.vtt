just<00:03:22.080> sits<00:03:22.590> there<00:03:22.680> absolutely<00:03:23.400> perfectly<00:03:24.180> now

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
just sits there absolutely perfectly now

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.490 
just sits there absolutely perfectly now
they<00:03:24.900> are<00:03:25.140> all<00:03:25.620> made<00:03:26.010> out<00:03:26.280> of<00:03:26.340> a<00:03:26.880> solid

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
they are all made out of a solid

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.280 
they are all made out of a solid
polyurethane<00:03:28.500> liquid<00:03:29.489> plastic<00:03:30.480> casting

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
polyurethane liquid plastic casting

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:32.990 
polyurethane liquid plastic casting
resin<00:03:31.530> if<00:03:32.040> that<00:03:32.220> makes<00:03:32.430> any<00:03:32.489> sense<00:03:32.790> to<00:03:32.940> you

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
resin if that makes any sense to you

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.970 
resin if that makes any sense to you
guys<00:03:33.239> I<00:03:33.540> don't<00:03:33.600> know<00:03:33.989> any<00:03:34.410> of<00:03:34.530> that<00:03:34.620> stuff

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
guys I don't know any of that stuff

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.620 
guys I don't know any of that stuff
but<00:03:35.250> basically<00:03:35.430> what<00:03:35.850> it<00:03:35.880> comes<00:03:36.000> down<00:03:36.329> to<00:03:36.390> is

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
but basically what it comes down to is

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.539 
but basically what it comes down to is
it's<00:03:36.840> very<00:03:37.260> durable<00:03:37.560> obviously<00:03:38.400> you<00:03:38.489> don't

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
it's very durable obviously you don't

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:40.280 
it's very durable obviously you don't
want<00:03:38.640> to<00:03:38.790> throw<00:03:39.060> it<00:03:39.090> against<00:03:39.390> concrete<00:03:39.870> or

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
want to throw it against concrete or

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.539 
want to throw it against concrete or
something<00:03:40.440> that'll<00:03:40.890> break<00:03:41.190> just<00:03:41.400> about

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
something that'll break just about

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.130 
something that'll break just about
anything<00:03:41.940> and<00:03:42.450> there<00:03:42.600> will<00:03:42.690> be<00:03:42.720> a<00:03:42.810> couple

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
anything and there will be a couple

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.199 
anything and there will be a couple
different<00:03:43.590> color<00:03:43.860> variations<00:03:44.610> for<00:03:44.850> it<00:03:45.000> that

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
different color variations for it that

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.210 
different color variations for it that
you<00:03:45.329> can<00:03:45.480> basically<00:03:45.630> pick<00:03:46.049> from<00:03:46.260> now<00:03:46.470> mine<00:03:46.769> is

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
you can basically pick from now mine is

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.130 
you can basically pick from now mine is
coated<00:03:47.700> with<00:03:47.880> an<00:03:48.030> aluminum<00:03:48.630> powder

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140 
coated with an aluminum powder

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:51.440 
coated with an aluminum powder
it's<00:03:49.620> gently<00:03:50.070> polished<00:03:50.489> up<00:03:50.579> a<00:03:50.700> little<00:03:50.880> bit<00:03:51.060> so

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
it's gently polished up a little bit so

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.780 
it's gently polished up a little bit so
will<00:03:51.660> be<00:03:51.780> coated<00:03:52.049> in<00:03:52.350> an<00:03:52.530> iron<00:03:52.860> powder<00:03:53.220> giving

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
will be coated in an iron powder giving

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.000 
will be coated in an iron powder giving
it<00:03:54.030> a<00:03:54.180> much<00:03:54.390> darker<00:03:54.840> kind<00:03:55.260> of<00:03:55.350> brush<00:03:55.650> smell

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
it a much darker kind of brush smell

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.400 
it a much darker kind of brush smell
look<00:03:56.280> someone<00:03:56.850> have<00:03:56.970> a<00:03:57.000> very<00:03:57.329> light<00:03:57.750> spraying

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
look someone have a very light spraying

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.250 
look someone have a very light spraying
of<00:03:58.799> silver<00:03:59.579> and<00:03:59.790> at<00:03:59.970> the<00:04:00.090> moment<00:04:00.630> there's<00:04:00.989> one

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
of silver and at the moment there's one

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.470 
of silver and at the moment there's one
that<00:04:01.380> spray<00:04:01.799> metallic<00:04:02.430> purple<00:04:02.730> which<00:04:03.269> i<00:04:03.420> think

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
that spray metallic purple which i think

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.330 
that spray metallic purple which i think
would<00:04:03.750> be<00:04:03.810> really<00:04:04.109> cool<00:04:04.380> as<00:04:04.530> well<00:04:04.739> just<00:04:05.220> kind

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
would be really cool as well just kind

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.099 
would be really cool as well just kind
of<00:04:05.459> going<00:04:05.609> along<00:04:05.910> with<00:04:06.000> the<00:04:06.120> whole<00:04:06.269> thing<00:04:06.510> my

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:07.109 
of going along with the whole thing my

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:12.170 
of going along with the whole thing my
only<00:04:08.570> criticism<00:04:09.570> I<00:04:10.200> suppose<00:04:10.799> would<00:04:11.459> be<00:04:11.760> I

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
only criticism I suppose would be I

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.610 
only criticism I suppose would be I
would<00:04:12.329> absolutely<00:04:12.720> love<00:04:13.049> it<00:04:13.260> if<00:04:13.350> it<00:04:13.500> was

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
would absolutely love it if it was

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.890 
would absolutely love it if it was
somehow<00:04:13.890> also<00:04:14.250> molded<00:04:14.820> in<00:04:15.030> in<00:04:15.359> a<00:04:15.510> different

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
somehow also molded in in a different

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.779 
somehow also molded in in a different
way<00:04:15.989> where<00:04:16.289> it<00:04:16.560> made<00:04:16.950> him<00:04:17.160> where<00:04:17.400> it<00:04:17.640> was

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
way where it made him where it was

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:19.789 
way where it made him where it was
actually<00:04:18.180> pointing<00:04:18.660> up<00:04:18.840> a<00:04:19.140> little<00:04:19.380> bit<00:04:19.560> more

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
actually pointing up a little bit more

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.830 
actually pointing up a little bit more
that<00:04:20.489> would<00:04:20.669> just<00:04:20.910> be<00:04:21.030> personal<00:04:21.450> preference

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
that would just be personal preference

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.000 
that would just be personal preference
like<00:04:21.959> if<00:04:22.140> this<00:04:22.380> was<00:04:24.140> angled<00:04:25.140> up<00:04:25.260> I<00:04:25.500> mean<00:04:25.860> that's

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
like if this was angled up I mean that's

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.460 
like if this was angled up I mean that's
that's<00:04:26.340> really<00:04:26.789> all<00:04:26.940> I<00:04:26.970> would<00:04:27.330> say<00:04:28.229> I<00:04:28.260> mean

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
that's really all I would say I mean

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.730 
that's really all I would say I mean
that<00:04:29.010> I<00:04:29.310> could<00:04:30.240> see<00:04:30.419> where<00:04:30.600> it<00:04:30.690> probably<00:04:30.840> would

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
that I could see where it probably would

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.380 
that I could see where it probably would
be<00:04:31.770> a<00:04:31.890> little<00:04:32.010> bit<00:04:32.250> harder<00:04:32.610> to<00:04:32.640> do<00:04:32.880> because<00:04:33.090> in

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.390 
be a little bit harder to do because in

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.870 
be a little bit harder to do because in
doing

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
doing

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.780 
doing
so<00:04:34.000> it<00:04:34.600> doesn't<00:04:34.990> make<00:04:35.110> it<00:04:35.260> as<00:04:35.380> secure<00:04:35.860> you<00:04:36.640> get

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:36.790 
so it doesn't make it as secure you get

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.670 
so it doesn't make it as secure you get
more<00:04:37.000> of<00:04:37.060> its<00:04:37.300> weight<00:04:37.570> pulling<00:04:37.960> it<00:04:38.230> down<00:04:38.440> in

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
more of its weight pulling it down in

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.040 
more of its weight pulling it down in
this<00:04:38.770> position<00:04:39.250> if<00:04:39.430> it<00:04:39.820> was<00:04:40.000> up<00:04:40.210> a<00:04:40.630> little<00:04:40.660> bit

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
this position if it was up a little bit

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.020 
this position if it was up a little bit
more<00:04:41.230> I'm<00:04:41.860> already<00:04:42.190> seeing<00:04:42.520> that<00:04:42.640> that<00:04:42.850> would

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
more I'm already seeing that that would

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.570 
more I'm already seeing that that would
probably<00:04:43.180> be<00:04:43.480> a<00:04:43.930> bad<00:04:44.380> design<00:04:44.800> element<00:04:45.310> so

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
probably be a bad design element so

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.610 
probably be a bad design element so
there's<00:04:46.300> proof<00:04:46.600> that<00:04:46.840> Alex<00:04:47.170> knows<00:04:47.380> better

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
there's proof that Alex knows better

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.560 
there's proof that Alex knows better
what<00:04:47.860> he's<00:04:48.010> doing<00:04:48.280> than<00:04:48.430> I<00:04:48.460> do<00:04:48.580> so<00:04:49.060> that's

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
what he's doing than I do so that's

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:50.820 
what he's doing than I do so that's
about<00:04:49.720> it<00:04:49.840> that's<00:04:50.050> all<00:04:50.230> I<00:04:50.260> can<00:04:50.380> really<00:04:50.590> think

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
about it that's all I can really think

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.310 
about it that's all I can really think
of<00:04:50.980> to<00:04:51.130> say<00:04:51.340> it's<00:04:52.180> a<00:04:52.330> wonderful<00:04:52.870> piece<00:04:53.080> and

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
of to say it's a wonderful piece and

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.780 
of to say it's a wonderful piece and
like<00:04:53.380> I<00:04:53.530> said<00:04:53.590> if<00:04:53.860> you<00:04:53.980> do<00:04:54.130> have<00:04:54.310> quake<00:04:54.580> wave

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:54.790 
like I said if you do have quake wave

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.030 
like I said if you do have quake wave
this<00:04:55.030> is<00:04:55.090> a<00:04:55.240> wonderful<00:04:56.020> way<00:04:56.200> to<00:04:56.470> get<00:04:56.860> it

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.040 
this is a wonderful way to get it

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.700 
this is a wonderful way to get it
displayed<00:04:57.880> in<00:04:58.210> his<00:04:58.270> gun<00:04:58.870> mode<00:04:59.080> cuz<00:04:59.350> without

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
displayed in his gun mode cuz without

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.610 
displayed in his gun mode cuz without
that<00:05:00.160> like<00:05:00.490> I<00:05:00.610> said<00:05:00.820> you're<00:05:01.290> you<00:05:02.290> don't<00:05:02.500> have

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
that like I said you're you don't have

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.090 
that like I said you're you don't have
any<00:05:02.800> options<00:05:03.190> it's<00:05:03.460> it's<00:05:04.260> this<00:05:05.260> in<00:05:05.890> your
