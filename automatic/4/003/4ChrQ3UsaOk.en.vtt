00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
no way that I see Malay yogurt so maybe

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.360 
no way that I see Malay yogurt so maybe
that<00:03:10.840> should<00:03:11.019> be<00:03:11.049> assigned<00:03:11.440> to<00:03:11.620> you<00:03:11.799> about

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
Pussycat Dolls but rather their baby
