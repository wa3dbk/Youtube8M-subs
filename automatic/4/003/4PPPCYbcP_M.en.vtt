00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:03.849 
TouchWiz UI which is responsive but this

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:05.610 
TouchWiz UI which is responsive but this
one<00:03:04.060> has<00:03:04.269> the<00:03:04.390> TouchWiz<00:03:04.750> UI<00:03:04.989> which<00:03:05.200> is<00:03:05.349> much

faster in terms of the launch time as
compared<00:04:05.109> to<00:04:05.170> an<00:04:05.350> iphone<00:04:05.440> 6<00:04:05.859> there<00:04:06.220> has<00:04:06.340> this

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
compared to an iphone 6 there has this

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:08.520 
compared to an iphone 6 there has this
device<00:04:06.880> if<00:04:07.269> you<00:04:07.329> launch<00:04:07.750> the<00:04:07.900> camera<00:04:08.139> I<00:04:08.290> can

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
device if you launch the camera I can

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.410 
device if you launch the camera I can
show<00:04:08.769> you<00:04:08.829> the<00:04:08.950> camera<00:04:09.400> over<00:04:09.940> there<00:04:10.060> and<00:04:10.299> I

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:10.420 
show you the camera over there and I

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.150 
show you the camera over there and I
will<00:04:10.810> try<00:04:10.989> to<00:04:11.079> launch<00:04:11.380> the<00:04:11.530> camera<00:04:11.799> on<00:04:12.040> this

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
will try to launch the camera on this

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.740 
will try to launch the camera on this
one<00:04:12.370> and<00:04:12.819> let's<00:04:13.000> see<00:04:13.120> how<00:04:13.209> much<00:04:13.329> time<00:04:13.480> does<00:04:13.660> it

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
one and let's see how much time does it

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.080 
one and let's see how much time does it
take

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
take

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.909 
take
so<00:04:15.720> as<00:04:15.810> you<00:04:15.840> can<00:04:15.989> see<00:04:16.139> it<00:04:16.199> has<00:04:16.290> taken<00:04:16.530> much<00:04:16.889> more

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
so as you can see it has taken much more

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.280 
so as you can see it has taken much more
time<00:04:17.340> as<00:04:17.579> compared<00:04:18.030> to<00:04:18.090> this<00:04:18.299> one<00:04:18.359> in<00:04:19.139> which

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
time as compared to this one in which

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.229 
time as compared to this one in which
the<00:04:19.470> camera<00:04:19.859> get<00:04:19.980> launched<00:04:20.220> much<00:04:20.459> faster<00:04:20.850> so

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
the camera get launched much faster so

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.290 
the camera get launched much faster so
in<00:04:21.389> any<00:04:21.600> way<00:04:21.870> samsung<00:04:22.350> galaxy<00:04:22.710> s6<00:04:23.100> is<00:04:23.430> far<00:04:24.090> more

in any way samsung galaxy s6 is far more

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.810 
in any way samsung galaxy s6 is far more
superior<00:04:24.660> better<00:04:25.530> in<00:04:25.919> almost<00:04:26.160> every

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
superior better in almost every

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.390 
superior better in almost every

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
samsung galaxy s5 and this device when

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.980 
samsung galaxy s5 and this device when
it<00:04:43.470> comes<00:04:43.710> to<00:04:43.830> the<00:04:43.919> battery<00:04:44.310> rating<00:04:44.900> there<00:04:45.900> is

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
it comes to the battery rating there is

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:47.600 
it comes to the battery rating there is
no<00:04:46.139> battery<00:04:46.500> rating<00:04:46.800> over<00:04:46.949> there<00:04:47.100> let<00:04:47.310> me<00:04:47.340> just

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
no battery rating over there let me just

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.670 
no battery rating over there let me just
remove<00:04:47.880> the<00:04:47.910> battery<00:04:48.300> and<00:04:48.330> show<00:04:48.660> you<00:04:48.720> from

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
this side so it is a 20 milliampere

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.420 
this side so it is a 20 milliampere
battery<00:04:52.290> which<00:04:52.440> is<00:04:52.560> bigger<00:04:52.800> than<00:04:53.010> the<00:04:53.130> battery

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
battery which is bigger than the battery

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.520 
battery which is bigger than the battery
which<00:04:53.550> we<00:04:53.700> have<00:04:53.900> inside<00:04:54.900> the<00:04:55.110> samsung<00:04:55.500> galaxy

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:55.530 
which we have inside the samsung galaxy

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.790 
which we have inside the samsung galaxy
s6<00:04:56.340> which<00:04:56.850> is<00:04:56.970> the<00:04:57.090> only<00:04:57.240> thing<00:04:57.780> in<00:04:58.020> which<00:04:58.290> this

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:58.800 
s6 which is the only thing in which this

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.680 
s6 which is the only thing in which this
device<00:04:59.160> is<00:04:59.430> better<00:04:59.820> because<00:05:00.030> this<00:05:00.300> one<00:05:00.479> has<00:05:00.510> a

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
device is better because this one has a

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.420 
device is better because this one has a
bigger<00:05:00.960> battery<00:05:01.380> but<00:05:01.800> again<00:05:02.010> the<00:05:02.130> difference

bigger battery but again the difference

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.270 
bigger battery but again the difference
is<00:05:02.550> not<00:05:02.760> much<00:05:03.060> and<00:05:03.479> definitely<00:05:04.080> the<00:05:04.680> overall

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
is not much and definitely the overall

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.770 
is not much and definitely the overall
you<00:05:05.490> I<00:05:05.550> response<00:05:06.030> and<00:05:06.300> the<00:05:06.389> kind<00:05:06.660> of
