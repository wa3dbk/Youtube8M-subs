00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.820
 it's a career made with love with 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.610
 heart as much as possible overturned the 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.230
 runners the landscape that we can see in 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.700
 the ultramarathon is practically the 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.170
 landscape that we can see in the iron 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:45.870
 from the coast the mountain the zones of 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.019
 laurisilva the peak areas the zone of 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.920
 pine forest has all as if 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:55.280
 you would make a turn at that time 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.280
 iron 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.170
 the tour to be a volcanic island the 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.780
 landscape is completely different from the 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.610
 Peninsula is very different and 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.520
 completely different also to the 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.369
 other islands is very peculiar very 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.790
 characteristic and makes it very pretty very 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:21.790
 special 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.000
 and the iron marathon means a lot 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.570
 since he started me four years ago I started 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.430
 in this world the mountain races 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.020
 km 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.120
 the next three years, it has been 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.310
 of the marathon marathon is spectacular 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:04.490
 landscaping of the best people that 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:08.260
 there is in Spain it is very familiar after what 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.260
 which also makes us repeat 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.629
 the landscapes 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.959
 to ascend or you find things that do not 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:33.909
 they wait for you and I am surprised by the process 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.909
 like to walk by them 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.550
 with my grandfather and my father as a child 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:45.250
 use the paths for the animals and 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.500
 give talks meals to other parts of the 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.150
 JCE and now it looks nice and is 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.640
 keeps clean and is taught to others 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.850
 people outside and they live the charm of 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.850
 daughter 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.240
 ah 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.610
 right now we are all very equipped 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.830
 with much sneaker a lot of backpack 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.660
 a lot of everything and I think that actually 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.340
 we should pay tribute to the 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.730
 pastors who actually were the ones who 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.110
 somehow invented this sport 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.700
 although they did not see it in that 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.310
 moment as a sport but rather a 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.350
 labor obligation I think we owe them 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.770
 something to these people then use their 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:46.670
 roads now it seems to me that it is partly 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.670
 Render is a good tribute 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:18.769
 I fall in love and do not commit witches 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.509
 I think it's the simplest magic 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.389
 and run and be able to do what you like 

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:27.749
 here then 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:27.749
 a dream is how it was touched and dream 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.450
 I think it 's the prize of the 

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:04.150
 constancy work the training the 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:08.790
 almost everyone's goal when we 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.790
 we aim for an event of this nature 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:25.190
 the first triumph in an ultra more 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:28.190
 doing on an island like the iron that 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:31.280
 I love it because I feel very happy 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:33.710
 the experience despite how hard it has 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:37.150
 been despite the fatigue despite the 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:37.150
 pain was worth it
