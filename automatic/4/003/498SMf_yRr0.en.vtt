it's dirty now we'll check the oil when

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.510 
it's dirty now we'll check the oil when

the engine is warm when oil is hot it

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.370 
the engine is warm when oil is hot it
expands<00:01:47.299> and<00:01:47.450> then<00:01:47.630> it<00:01:47.719> contracts<00:01:48.079> when<00:01:48.259> it's

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
expands and then it contracts when it's

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.620 
expands and then it contracts when it's
cold<00:01:48.619> so<00:01:49.130> different<00:01:49.820> temperatures<00:01:50.210> will<00:01:50.509> give

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
cold so different temperatures will give

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.749 
cold so different temperatures will give
you<00:01:50.780> different<00:01:50.810> results<00:01:51.499> step<00:01:52.159> two<00:01:52.429> is<00:01:52.670> to

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
you different results step two is to

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:54.399 
you different results step two is to
make<00:01:53.119> sure<00:01:53.149> that<00:01:53.509> the<00:01:53.600> engine<00:01:53.899> is<00:01:53.990> turned<00:01:54.229> off

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
make sure that the engine is turned off

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:56.800 
make sure that the engine is turned off
and<00:01:54.770> to<00:01:55.280> pop<00:01:55.460> the<00:01:55.609> hood<00:01:55.729> of<00:01:55.880> your<00:01:55.909> car<00:01:56.149> now<00:01:56.659> will

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
and to pop the hood of your car now will

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.270 
and to pop the hood of your car now will
do<00:01:56.990> this<00:01:57.170> by<00:01:57.350> pushing<00:01:57.679> the<00:01:57.859> hood<00:01:57.979> release

do this by pushing the hood release

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.120 
do this by pushing the hood release
button

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.240 

and<00:02:02.960> then<00:02:03.960> squeezing<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.530> handle<00:02:04.890> underneath

that sticks out with a loop on it like
this<00:02:29.190> the<00:02:30.030> oil<00:02:30.300> dipstick<00:02:30.720> is<00:02:31.050> usually<00:02:31.650> in

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
this the oil dipstick is usually in

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.290 
this the oil dipstick is usually in

has a type of indicator on it just pull

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.059 
has a type of indicator on it just pull
on<00:02:39.390> the<00:02:39.630> loop<00:02:39.810> and<00:02:39.959> pull<00:02:40.019> the<00:02:40.590> dipstick<00:02:40.709> out

on the loop and pull the dipstick out

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.460 
on the loop and pull the dipstick out
now<00:02:41.670> wipe<00:02:42.239> the<00:02:42.390> dipstick<00:02:42.720> clean<00:02:42.959> with<00:02:43.170> a<00:02:43.200> rag

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
now wipe the dipstick clean with a rag

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.550 
now wipe the dipstick clean with a rag
or<00:02:43.590> paper<00:02:43.650> towel<00:02:44.420> then<00:02:45.420> put<00:02:46.140> the<00:02:46.230> dipstick

back<00:02:46.769> all<00:02:47.010> the<00:02:47.340> way<00:02:47.430> in<00:02:47.580> it's<00:02:47.819> easy<00:02:48.209> it<00:02:48.450> just

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
back all the way in it's easy it just

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.710 
back all the way in it's easy it just
slides<00:02:48.870> right<00:02:49.019> in<00:02:52.880> now<00:02:53.880> once<00:02:54.120> it's<00:02:54.360> all<00:02:54.569> the

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
way down pull it back out again look at

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.319 
way down pull it back out again look at
the<00:02:58.769> end<00:02:58.920> of<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.099> dipstick<00:02:59.459> dipsticks

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
the end of the dipstick dipsticks

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.240 
the end of the dipstick dipsticks
usually<00:03:00.900> have<00:03:01.049> a<00:03:01.079> line<00:03:01.380> marked<00:03:01.650> full<00:03:01.890> on<00:03:02.069> them

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
usually have a line marked full on them

usually have a line marked full on them
other<00:03:02.549> dipsticks<00:03:03.329> have<00:03:03.569> two<00:03:03.810> lines<00:03:04.019> with<00:03:04.380> a

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
other dipsticks have two lines with a

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.710 
other dipsticks have two lines with a
textured<00:03:04.739> area<00:03:05.130> in<00:03:05.280> between<00:03:05.370> them<00:03:05.730> the<00:03:06.510> oil

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
textured area in between them the oil

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.509 
textured area in between them the oil
should<00:03:07.019> be<00:03:07.049> halfway<00:03:07.410> in<00:03:07.829> between<00:03:07.859> the<00:03:08.310> lines

now if it's lower than that or below the
full<00:03:10.650> line<00:03:10.859> you'll<00:03:11.400> likely<00:03:11.609> need<00:03:11.850> more<00:03:12.060> oil

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
full line you'll likely need more oil

full line you'll likely need more oil
step<00:03:13.260> number<00:03:13.410> four<00:03:13.739> is<00:03:13.920> checking<00:03:14.459> where<00:03:14.700> the

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.550 
oil is and the color clean oil in most
cars<00:03:17.940> should<00:03:18.299> be<00:03:18.450> amber<00:03:18.780> also<00:03:19.470> feel<00:03:20.100> the<00:03:20.280> oil

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
cars should be amber also feel the oil

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.860 
cars should be amber also feel the oil

now if the oil feels gritty the oil is

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:26.780 
now if the oil feels gritty the oil is
dirty<00:03:25.139> and<00:03:25.230> needs<00:03:25.470> to<00:03:25.590> be<00:03:25.680> changed<00:03:25.889> but<00:03:26.579> if<00:03:26.639> the

still<00:03:29.250> feels<00:03:29.489> clean<00:03:29.760> we<00:03:30.180> can<00:03:30.329> add<00:03:30.420> some<00:03:30.540> new

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
still feels clean we can add some new

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:37.520 
still feels clean we can add some new
oil<00:03:35.120> now<00:03:36.120> to<00:03:36.180> add<00:03:36.420> oil<00:03:36.630> all<00:03:36.989> you<00:03:37.230> need<00:03:37.380> is<00:03:37.410> a

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
oil now to add oil all you need is a

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:43.070 
oil now to add oil all you need is a
bottle<00:03:37.769> of<00:03:37.920> motor<00:03:38.160> oil<00:03:38.250> and<00:03:38.579> a<00:03:38.760> funnel

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.720 

you<00:03:44.080> need<00:03:44.290> to<00:03:44.440> wait<00:03:44.650> for<00:03:44.920> the<00:03:45.100> engine<00:03:45.430> to<00:03:45.550> cool

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
you need to wait for the engine to cool

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.490 
you need to wait for the engine to cool
now<00:03:46.090> that's<00:03:46.240> step<00:03:46.480> number<00:03:46.510> five<00:03:46.930> you<00:03:47.410> can

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
now that's step number five you can
