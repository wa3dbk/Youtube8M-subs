00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 the biologist and superintendent of 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.859
 environment of the city of colombia maria 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.540
 Inacia was found in jars with the 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.300
 president of the fishermen's association 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.049
 amateurs and sportsmen of the river valley 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.170
 great 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.930
 i am appeared both are very 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.390
 concerned about predatory fishing in 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.180
 of the region, mainly on the 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.769
 from the Columbia Bridge to the 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.630
 dam of furnas 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.130
 I've been noticing that over the 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.800
 last three years 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.680
 the big river it has been lowering its level 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.450
 every year he does not come back 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.540
 equal to the level he came 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:43.620
 years and every year and 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:46.110
 it's taking longer to be able to fill it up 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.360
 we have six months of full and six 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.489
 months in his old bed that the 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.980
 box of the great river that was previous month 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.190
 to the dam and what happened due to 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.199
 this two - year period to here what 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.420
 we have information that we have is 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.570
 that he will not return as soon as the box 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.119
 Then we have water level. 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.000
 there and there are places that the 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:12.180
 shows and with this has been occurring that the 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.890
 predatory fishing that occurs over the 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.830
 of the year right? 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:20.310
 but quantity with a volume of water 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:23.549
 the bigger was as the fish fled and 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.830
 now has not formed pockets of 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.600
 water in the middle of the stones they became 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.240
 easy prey 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.729
 so why actually the river 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.780
 large is a food court of the 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.770
 fish 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.939
 it rises brown go to the mogi spawn 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.030
 and come back 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.909
 due to this lack of rain and no 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.520
 have water that happened this year they 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.549
 have come up or not to return or many 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.399
 were dug they getting it now without 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:56.759
 food with the amount of water 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:59.310
 decreased and the next people playing the 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.960
 I treat the fish they are hungry they come 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.329
 to the place to feed 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:08.160
 they are designed primarily with the 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:10.200
 fishing from japan that is one and now until 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.569
 a short time was using cylinders 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.910
 today neither cylinder anymore are using it 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:18.510
 the fish of the visit 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:20.580
 are places that I used to have with the fish 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.190
 species, especially species 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.070
 which are in danger of extinction are 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:29.100
 are easily viewed and with this 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:32.370
 are employed as large river 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:34.620
 is low due to drought as revealed by 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.710
 photographic survey by the 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.680
 biologist fish are easy prey for 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:43.800
 predatory fishing and there are many 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:47.400
 forms of illegal fishing a practice 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:50.460
 Forbidden but common lately is air 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.570
 polar native fish such as the 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.180
 golden 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:57.210
 the report went to a hunting lodge and 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.990
 fishing and showed that the harpoon is sold 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:03.630
 usually around 600 reais each 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:06.210
 photos posted by fishermen on the 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.590
 facebook reveal that by injuries 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:10.830
 of fish 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:13.200
 all were pointed out the biologist said 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:16.590
 who even attempted to extend the 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.630
 river due to the drought but did not 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.780
 result I attended a meeting 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.990
 we went we sent a document 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.670
 to the Ministry of the Environment 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:28.920
 requesting that it be extended 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:34.140
 because we realize that fish do not 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:36.870
 had spawned did not occur like all 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.720
 years and was done study was 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.330
 presented a report more information 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.970
 received is that there would be no recourse 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:49.560
 to pay the off - season to pay the insurance 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:52.290
 defense and with this this piracema released 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:56.510
 fishing usually did what it is 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:59.970
 fisherman insurance outside the deadline né 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:02.400
 foreseen, it is precisely this insurance that 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.860
 he receives the salary he receives from 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.110
 control and predatory fishing is 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:11.430
 complicated in the Rio Grande according to 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:13.770
 environmental military police biologist 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:17.280
 state of são paulo she can not reach 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:21.000
 to the dam when it goes out to 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:23.280
 I can get them to say yes 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.660
 fishermen who are the 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.530
 predators that have a lot of fisherman 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.680
 conscious they flee the mining side 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.540
 then a very large extent so 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:35.900
 what has been happening for what I see 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:37.790
 there I have to have tried to have 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.010
 partnership through the action plan 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.980
 to try to help the environment 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:45.080
 on this issue with one with equipment 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:48.980
 for him to be able to do these monitoring 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:52.220
 but you get ambient with engine 41 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:55.070
 moped 90 which is the 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:57.860
 chance so they are 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:01.310
 trying to do their part but peri 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.960
 needs greater action to 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.910
 the president of the fishermen's association 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.610
 from the rio grande valley 

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:09.140
 The solution is to ban fishing in this 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.810
 stretch of the big river 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:14.090
 something that is already being tried by 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:17.090
 association of the secretary of the 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:19.370
 environment the joão jardim calls today the 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:22.550
 quito crossroads by a document 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:24.200
 justifying the prohibition for the 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:26.930
 preparation of a project for the 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:29.360
 prohibition of fishing for gumercindo 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.250
 colombia hairstyle to the dam 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:34.430
 the mayor prepared a document is in 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:37.760
 my hands also giving full support 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:40.940
 asking is the discipline of the big river with 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:42.860
 relation to overfishing aa doctor 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:45.020
 adriana who is the promoter of the 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:47.090
 environment has also drawn up a document 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:49.490
 we have an environmental expert then 

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:52.539
 we have all the documentation ready 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:54.560
 which probably lead us to the 

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:56.960
 secretary for the environment of the state of 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.940
 são paulo which is the bruno pits that will take 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:00.860
 this document up to the general hands of the lol 

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:03.530
 that it is the governor to hear the 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.810
 The necessary argumentation is 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:08.479
 requirements for closure 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:11.120
 predatory fishing from the bridge to the 

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:13.729
 dam with 30 40 or more 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:16.010
 60 days to train this law forbidding 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:17.510
 from the bridge to the dam to 

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:20.479
 knowledge of the population will take into 

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:24.350
 the whole region is mato grosso do sul mato 

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:27.500
 northern tocantins and goias already have 

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:30.050
 specific lawson strict laws and 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:32.060
 applications unfortunately the 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:34.190
 goiás and mato grosso are coming all 

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:37.340
 for Colombia, so I think the 

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:39.560
 start is from the bridge commercio down 

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:41.030
 sure with faith in god 

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:43.160
 the way fishermen will have 

00:06:41.030 --> 00:06:45.920
 this happiness does not celebrate together with 

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:50.380
 the population barretense colombia to nura 

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:53.920
 Guaíra now guaíra is at last the whole 

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:53.920
 save the big river
