00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.470 
get a proper lighting system and to just
basically<00:00:53.219> make<00:00:53.460> your<00:00:53.579> models<00:00:53.879> looking<00:00:54.180> not<00:00:54.300> a

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
basically make your models looking not a

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.799 
basically make your models looking not a
lot<00:00:55.079> nicer<00:00:55.289> when<00:00:55.620> you<00:00:55.739> render<00:00:55.980> them<00:00:56.360> okay<00:00:57.360> so

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
lot nicer when you render them okay so

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.830 
lot nicer when you render them okay so
I'm<00:00:58.050> very<00:00:58.260> new<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.649> mayor<00:00:58.829> so<00:00:59.539> there<00:01:00.539> may<00:01:00.809> be

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
I'm very new to mayor so there may be

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.900 
I'm very new to mayor so there may be
other<00:01:00.989> methods<00:01:01.590> to<00:01:01.920> do<00:01:02.039> this<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.190> bit<00:01:02.399> faster<00:01:02.820> or

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
other methods to do this a bit faster or

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.060 
other methods to do this a bit faster or
a<00:01:02.969> bit<00:01:03.090> better<00:01:03.660> but<00:01:04.019> this<00:01:04.110> is<00:01:04.260> how<00:01:04.379> i<00:01:04.409> narced<00:01:04.830> it

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
a bit better but this is how i narced it

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.370 
a bit better but this is how i narced it
so<00:01:05.189> basically<00:01:05.430> start<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:05.850> new<00:01:05.970> scene<00:01:06.750> you'll

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
so basically start a new scene you'll

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.500 
so basically start a new scene you'll
already<00:01:07.560> have<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.830> new<00:01:07.979> scene<00:01:08.250> beat<00:01:09.090> Florine

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
already have a new scene beat Florine

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.179 
already have a new scene beat Florine
you<00:01:10.020> can<00:01:10.140> put<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:10.470> setting<00:01:10.860> on<00:01:10.979> if<00:01:11.100> you

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
you can put that setting on if you

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.240 
you can put that setting on if you
really<00:01:11.220> want<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.850> that<00:01:11.970> way<00:01:12.530> you<00:01:13.530> can<00:01:13.680> see<00:01:14.070> your

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
really want to that way you can see your

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.999 
really want to that way you can see your
objects<00:01:14.670> reveling<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.030> see<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.299> wireframe

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 
objects reveling to see the wireframe

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:18.560 
objects reveling to see the wireframe
get<00:01:17.009> your<00:01:17.430> object<00:01:17.909> that<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:18.060> want<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.240> render

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
get your object that you want to render

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.149 
get your object that you want to render
let's<00:01:18.810> go<00:01:18.930> cube<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.530> let's<00:01:19.650> actually<00:01:19.799> do<00:01:20.040> the

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
let's go cube and let's actually do the

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.429 
let's go cube and let's actually do the
stuffing<00:01:20.400> like<00:01:20.490> se<00:01:20.810> so<00:01:21.810> with<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:21.990> lighting

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
stuffing like se so with a lighting

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.230 
stuffing like se so with a lighting
looks<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.650> little<00:01:22.740> bit<00:01:22.920> different<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.430> seer

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
looks a little bit different a seer

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.870 
looks a little bit different a seer
cylinder<00:01:24.840> I<00:01:24.869> mean<00:01:25.170> okay<00:01:25.950> so<00:01:26.340> we've<00:01:26.610> got<00:01:26.729> our

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
cylinder I mean okay so we've got our

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.179 
cylinder I mean okay so we've got our
two<00:01:26.909> items<00:01:27.450> yep<00:01:27.810> they<00:01:27.960> look<00:01:28.110> fine<00:01:28.439> if<00:01:28.890> I<00:01:28.979> take<00:01:29.130> a

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
two items yep they look fine if I take a

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.690 
two items yep they look fine if I take a
picture<00:01:29.549> now<00:01:29.659> it<00:01:30.659> will<00:01:30.840> just<00:01:30.960> look<00:01:31.110> like<00:01:31.259> that

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
picture now it will just look like that

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.120 
picture now it will just look like that
no<00:01:32.700> light<00:01:32.939> in<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.420> very<00:01:34.140> very<00:01:34.470> basic<00:01:34.920> shading

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
no light in and very very basic shading

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.660 
no light in and very very basic shading
just<00:01:35.340> very<00:01:35.729> block<00:01:36.060> shaded<00:01:36.900> okay<00:01:37.680> so<00:01:38.340> now<00:01:38.490> let's

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
just very block shaded okay so now let's

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.899 
just very block shaded okay so now let's
move<00:01:38.790> on<00:01:38.970> from<00:01:39.060> there<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:40.369> basically<00:01:41.369> when

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
move on from there and basically when

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.550 
move on from there and basically when
you<00:01:42.060> first<00:01:42.270> load<00:01:42.509> up<00:01:42.689> your<00:01:42.750> program<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.409> will

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
you first load up your program you will

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.550 
you first load up your program you will
not<00:01:43.799> have<00:01:44.009> this<00:01:44.220> option<00:01:44.509> mentalray<00:01:45.509> you<00:01:46.439> will

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
not have this option mentalray you will

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.440 
not have this option mentalray you will
not<00:01:46.649> have<00:01:46.770> been<00:01:46.890> away<00:01:47.130> there<00:01:47.369> you<00:01:47.909> might<00:01:48.180> if

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
not have been away there you might if

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.510 
not have been away there you might if
you're<00:01:48.659> lucky<00:01:48.810> but<00:01:49.500> usually<00:01:49.950> it's<00:01:50.070> disabled

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
you're lucky but usually it's disabled

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.190 
you're lucky but usually it's disabled
when<00:01:50.640> you<00:01:50.729> first<00:01:50.909> get<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.270> program<00:01:51.750> so

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
when you first get the program so

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.049 
an angle like that okay yep so they come

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:25.030 
an angle like that okay yep so they come
straight<00:03:24.350> in<00:03:24.500> that's<00:03:24.680> going<00:03:24.830> to<00:03:24.890> leave<00:03:25.010> a

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
straight in that's going to leave a

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.910 
straight in that's going to leave a
shadow<00:03:25.340> coming<00:03:25.670> across<00:03:25.970> here<00:03:26.350> now<00:03:27.350> if<00:03:27.530> I<00:03:27.680> take

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
shadow coming across here now if I take

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.979 
shadow coming across here now if I take
a<00:03:27.980> render<00:03:28.580> now<00:03:28.730> like<00:03:28.940> if<00:03:29.090> I<00:03:29.209> just<00:03:29.390> go<00:03:29.540> preview

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
a render now like if I just go preview

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:31.780 
a render now like if I just go preview
of<00:03:30.049> my<00:03:30.080> last<00:03:30.320> one<00:03:30.530> it<00:03:30.890> looks<00:03:31.040> like<00:03:31.190> that<00:03:31.400> I've

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
of my last one it looks like that I've

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.340 
of my last one it looks like that I've
changed<00:03:32.360> the<00:03:32.420> resolution<00:03:32.570> and<00:03:33.290> the

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
changed the resolution and the

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.500 
changed the resolution and the
environmental<00:03:34.070> lighting<00:03:34.280> since<00:03:34.610> then<00:03:34.790> so<00:03:35.209> it

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
environmental lighting since then so it

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.810 
environmental lighting since then so it
should<00:03:35.870> give<00:03:36.680> it<00:03:36.860> all<00:03:37.070> the<00:03:37.250> lighting<00:03:37.459> effects

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:37.820 
should give it all the lighting effects

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.150 
should give it all the lighting effects
you<00:03:37.940> want<00:03:38.030> vaigai<00:03:38.630> that<00:03:39.560> gives<00:03:39.920> you<00:03:40.100> a<00:03:40.130> very

basic lighting effects and it makes sure

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.560
