00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:32.020 
what's one of the main issues that

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.229 
what's one of the main issues that
people<00:00:32.169> see<00:00:32.500> with<00:00:32.739> exhaust<00:00:33.249> power<00:00:33.579> valves<00:00:33.940> the

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239 
people see with exhaust power valves the

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:35.489 
people see with exhaust power valves the
biggest<00:00:34.510> issue<00:00:34.690> that<00:00:34.809> you<00:00:34.989> see<00:00:35.170> with<00:00:35.350> an

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:35.499 
biggest issue that you see with an

00:00:35.499 --> 00:00:37.799 
biggest issue that you see with an
exhaust<00:00:35.800> power<00:00:36.039> valve<00:00:36.280> is<00:00:36.489> sticking<00:00:37.059> if<00:00:37.449> it<00:00:37.629> if

00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:37.809 
exhaust power valve is sticking if it if

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:40.319 
exhaust power valve is sticking if it if
it<00:00:37.929> fail<00:00:38.140> if<00:00:38.409> it<00:00:38.499> fails<00:00:38.739> to<00:00:38.980> operate<00:00:39.399> so<00:00:39.969> maybe

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:40.329 
it fail if it fails to operate so maybe

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:41.729 
it fail if it fails to operate so maybe
I<00:00:40.390> should<00:00:40.600> back<00:00:40.780> up<00:00:40.809> just<00:00:41.199> a<00:00:41.260> little<00:00:41.289> bit<00:00:41.469> what

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:41.739 
I should back up just a little bit what

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:43.709 
I should back up just a little bit what
does<00:00:41.949> an<00:00:42.039> exhaust<00:00:42.399> power<00:00:42.730> valve<00:00:43.030> do<00:00:43.300> for<00:00:43.690> a

00:00:43.709 --> 00:00:43.719 
does an exhaust power valve do for a

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:45.660 
does an exhaust power valve do for a
two-stroke<00:00:44.170> engine<00:00:44.530> exhaust<00:00:45.069> power<00:00:45.370> valves

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 
two-stroke engine exhaust power valves

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.160 
two-stroke engine exhaust power valves
allow<00:00:45.819> it<00:00:45.969> to<00:00:46.120> stroke<00:00:46.359> engine<00:00:46.659> to<00:00:46.809> be<00:00:46.929> more

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
allow it to stroke engine to be more

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.829 
allow it to stroke engine to be more
usable<00:00:47.679> across<00:00:47.920> a<00:00:48.010> real<00:00:48.309> wide<00:00:48.579> rpm<00:00:49.269> band<00:00:49.479> it'll

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:49.839 
usable across a real wide rpm band it'll

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:51.509 
usable across a real wide rpm band it'll
give<00:00:49.960> it<00:00:49.989> good<00:00:50.350> power<00:00:50.589> down<00:00:50.920> low<00:00:51.159> when<00:00:51.339> you<00:00:51.429> go

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:51.519 
give it good power down low when you go

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:53.129 
give it good power down low when you go
to<00:00:51.579> take<00:00:51.789> off<00:00:51.999> okay<00:00:52.449> we'll<00:00:52.569> also<00:00:52.690> give<00:00:52.960> you<00:00:52.989> the

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:53.139 
to take off okay we'll also give you the

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:55.500 
to take off okay we'll also give you the
good<00:00:53.260> power<00:00:53.469> up<00:00:53.710> top<00:00:54.100> so<00:00:54.670> what<00:00:54.879> exactly<00:00:54.999> would

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:55.510 
good power up top so what exactly would

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.349 
good power up top so what exactly would
make<00:00:55.719> a<00:00:55.749> power<00:00:56.109> valve<00:00:56.289> stick<00:00:56.729> the<00:00:57.729> very<00:00:57.909> design

00:00:58.349 --> 00:00:58.359 
make a power valve stick the very design

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:00.450 
make a power valve stick the very design
of<00:00:58.629> the<00:00:59.109> exhaust<00:00:59.440> power<00:00:59.739> valve<00:01:00.010> can

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
of the exhaust power valve can

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.729 
of the exhaust power valve can
contribute<00:01:00.789> to<00:01:00.940> sticking<00:01:01.299> these<00:01:02.170> things<00:01:02.440> work

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
contribute to sticking these things work

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:04.439 
contribute to sticking these things work
in<00:01:02.979> the<00:01:03.100> exhaust<00:01:03.460> stream<00:01:03.729> of<00:01:03.879> the<00:01:03.969> engine<00:01:04.269> so

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
in the exhaust stream of the engine so

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:06.150 
in the exhaust stream of the engine so
anything<00:01:04.900> that<00:01:05.260> the<00:01:05.379> engine<00:01:05.680> burns<00:01:05.920> the

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:06.160 
anything that the engine burns the

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.400 
anything that the engine burns the
gasoline<00:01:06.700> the<00:01:06.880> oil<00:01:07.210> is<00:01:07.480> all<00:01:07.990> going<00:01:08.170> to<00:01:08.260> make

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:08.410 
gasoline the oil is all going to make

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:09.810 
gasoline the oil is all going to make
its<00:01:08.560> way<00:01:08.590> past<00:01:08.680> that<00:01:09.040> power<00:01:09.370> valve<00:01:09.580> and<00:01:09.760> if

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
its way past that power valve and if

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:11.670 
its way past that power valve and if
it's<00:01:09.970> gonna<00:01:10.090> if<00:01:10.480> it<00:01:10.660> if<00:01:10.870> it's<00:01:11.050> forming

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
it's gonna if it if it's forming

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.950 
it's gonna if it if it's forming
deposits<00:01:11.770> or<00:01:12.370> there's<00:01:12.670> carbon<00:01:13.000> involved<00:01:13.540> it's

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:13.960 
deposits or there's carbon involved it's

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.240 
deposits or there's carbon involved it's
going<00:01:14.110> to<00:01:14.170> end<00:01:14.290> up<00:01:14.350> stuck<00:01:14.590> on<00:01:14.740> the<00:01:14.800> valve<00:01:14.980> so<00:01:15.190> if

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
going to end up stuck on the valve so if

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.920 
going to end up stuck on the valve so if
a<00:01:15.340> power<00:01:15.550> valve<00:01:15.760> exhaust<00:01:16.210> power<00:01:16.450> valve<00:01:16.690> does

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:16.930 
a power valve exhaust power valve does

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.870 
a power valve exhaust power valve does
stick<00:01:17.350> what<00:01:17.890> kind<00:01:18.070> of<00:01:18.100> what<00:01:18.340> does<00:01:18.520> that<00:01:18.550> do<00:01:18.790> to

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
stick what kind of what does that do to

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.190 
stick what kind of what does that do to
the<00:01:18.970> performance<00:01:19.450> of<00:01:19.570> the<00:01:19.630> engine<00:01:19.930> you're

of<00:01:36.580> these<00:01:36.700> off<00:01:36.910> take<00:01:37.150> a<00:01:37.180> look<00:01:37.330> at<00:01:37.420> one<00:01:37.540> of<00:01:37.570> them

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
of these off take a look at one of them

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:48.719 
of these off take a look at one of them
we<00:01:37.930> sure<00:01:38.080> can<00:01:38.290> great

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:51.310 

all<00:01:49.729> right<00:01:49.820> so<00:01:50.000> Len<00:01:50.180> what<00:01:50.689> am<00:01:50.780> I<00:01:50.810> looking<00:01:51.080> at<00:01:51.170> is

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
all right so Len what am I looking at is

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.590 
all right so Len what am I looking at is
this<00:01:51.439> good<00:01:51.650> bad<00:01:51.950> and<00:01:52.220> different<00:01:52.549> well<00:01:53.479> if<00:01:53.540> you

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
this good bad and different well if you

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.149 
this good bad and different well if you
take<00:01:53.659> a<00:01:53.720> look<00:01:53.840> at<00:01:53.960> this<00:01:54.049> valve<00:01:54.320> you're<00:01:54.950> looking

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
take a look at this valve you're looking

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:56.830 
take a look at this valve you're looking
for<00:01:55.340> like<00:01:55.850> we<00:01:55.970> talked<00:01:56.150> about<00:01:56.270> we're<00:01:56.630> looking

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
for like we talked about we're looking

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.660 
for like we talked about we're looking
for<00:01:57.080> depositing<00:01:57.619> you're<00:01:57.890> looking<00:01:58.130> for<00:01:58.310> carbon

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
for depositing you're looking for carbon

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.399 
for depositing you're looking for carbon
this<00:01:59.509> little<00:01:59.810> bit<00:01:59.900> of<00:01:59.930> oil<00:02:00.049> that<00:02:00.290> you're

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
this little bit of oil that you're

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:01.600 
this little bit of oil that you're
seeing<00:02:00.590> around<00:02:00.740> here<00:02:00.920> on<00:02:01.130> the<00:02:01.159> edges<00:02:01.490> that's

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
seeing around here on the edges that's

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:02.980 
seeing around here on the edges that's
normal<00:02:02.090> they're<00:02:02.210> all<00:02:02.360> going<00:02:02.540> to<00:02:02.630> do<00:02:02.750> that<00:02:02.899> you

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
normal they're all going to do that you

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.510 
normal they're all going to do that you
want<00:02:03.259> to<00:02:03.350> see<00:02:03.560> this<00:02:03.740> if<00:02:03.950> you<00:02:04.100> pulled<00:02:04.340> it<00:02:04.460> out

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
want to see this if you pulled it out

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.920 
want to see this if you pulled it out
and<00:02:04.670> you<00:02:04.729> saw<00:02:04.880> all<00:02:04.970> kinds<00:02:05.210> of<00:02:05.270> hard<00:02:05.479> carbon<00:02:05.840> on

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
and you saw all kinds of hard carbon on

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.600 
and you saw all kinds of hard carbon on
it<00:02:06.020> you'd<00:02:06.110> know<00:02:06.259> right<00:02:06.470> away<00:02:06.710> so<00:02:07.340> with<00:02:07.460> this

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
it you'd know right away so with this

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.029 
it you'd know right away so with this
particular<00:02:07.880> example<00:02:08.360> what<00:02:08.600> we<00:02:08.720> can<00:02:08.869> do<00:02:09.020> is<00:02:09.890> we

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
particular example what we can do is we

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.580 
particular example what we can do is we
can<00:02:10.130> actually<00:02:10.429> wipe<00:02:10.580> away<00:02:11.170> this<00:02:12.170> little<00:02:12.380> bit

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
can actually wipe away this little bit

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.970 
can actually wipe away this little bit
of<00:02:12.650> oil<00:02:12.800> that's<00:02:12.980> left<00:02:13.280> over<00:02:13.989> and<00:02:14.989> what<00:02:15.739> you<00:02:15.830> can

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
of oil that's left over and what you can

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.699 
of oil that's left over and what you can
see<00:02:16.010> is<00:02:16.910> that<00:02:17.480> there<00:02:17.810> is<00:02:17.900> virtually<00:02:18.170> no

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
see is that there is virtually no

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.070 
see is that there is virtually no
depositing<00:02:19.640> on<00:02:19.760> this<00:02:20.120> valve<00:02:20.330> at<00:02:20.510> all<00:02:20.630> that's

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
depositing on this valve at all that's

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.990 
depositing on this valve at all that's
clean<00:02:21.350> it's<00:02:21.709> very<00:02:21.830> clean<00:02:22.340> this<00:02:22.580> is<00:02:22.700> actually<00:02:22.940> a

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
clean it's very clean this is actually a

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.030 
clean it's very clean this is actually a
real<00:02:23.239> good<00:02:23.420> example<00:02:23.510> so<00:02:24.260> if<00:02:24.380> you<00:02:24.500> have<00:02:24.650> a<00:02:24.680> clean

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
real good example so if you have a clean

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.020 
real good example so if you have a clean
valve<00:02:25.310> that<00:02:25.489> means<00:02:25.670> you're<00:02:25.760> gonna<00:02:25.850> have<00:02:25.970> a

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
valve that means you're gonna have a

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.220 
valve that means you're gonna have a
good<00:02:26.150> day<00:02:26.209> on<00:02:26.360> the<00:02:26.480> trails<00:02:26.810> you're<00:02:27.019> going<00:02:27.170> to

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
good day on the trails you're going to

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.660 
good day on the trails you're going to
have<00:02:27.319> a<00:02:27.380> good<00:02:27.530> day<00:02:27.709> this<00:02:27.920> valve<00:02:28.160> will<00:02:28.280> operate

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
have a good day this valve will operate

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.160 
have a good day this valve will operate
freely<00:02:28.940> little<00:02:29.450> this<00:02:29.600> thing<00:02:29.810> will<00:02:29.900> provide

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
freely little this thing will provide

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.660 
freely little this thing will provide
this<00:02:30.739> one<00:02:30.950> didn't<00:02:31.130> really<00:02:31.190> need<00:02:31.489> to<00:02:31.580> be

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
this one didn't really need to be

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.640 
this one didn't really need to be
cleaned<00:02:31.880> Rob<00:02:32.060> great<00:02:32.569> can<00:02:33.110> we<00:02:33.200> take<00:02:33.350> a<00:02:33.380> look<00:02:33.560> at

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
cleaned Rob great can we take a look at

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.170 
cleaned Rob great can we take a look at
the<00:02:33.739> valve<00:02:34.010> off<00:02:34.190> of<00:02:34.340> this<00:02:34.400> machine<00:02:34.550> yeah<00:02:35.060> we

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
the valve off of this machine yeah we

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:44.800 
the valve off of this machine yeah we
sure<00:02:35.330> can<00:02:35.540> great

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.140 

so<00:02:45.709> Len<00:02:45.860> tell<00:02:46.280> me<00:02:46.400> what<00:02:46.520> am<00:02:46.610> I<00:02:46.670> looking<00:02:46.790> at<00:02:47.000> here

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
so Len tell me what am I looking at here

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.670 
so Len tell me what am I looking at here
with<00:02:47.270> this<00:02:47.420> valve<00:02:47.630> well<00:02:48.200> what<00:02:48.350> you're<00:02:48.440> looking

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
with this valve well what you're looking

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.680 
with this valve well what you're looking
at<00:02:48.770> here<00:02:48.830> is<00:02:49.130> the<00:02:49.430> start<00:02:49.700> of<00:02:49.790> a<00:02:49.850> problem<00:02:50.090> Rob<00:02:50.420> if

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
at here is the start of a problem Rob if

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.059 
at here is the start of a problem Rob if
you<00:02:50.840> take<00:02:50.990> a<00:02:51.020> look<00:02:51.230> real<00:02:51.410> closely<00:02:51.680> at<00:02:51.950> this

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
you take a look real closely at this

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:53.680 
you take a look real closely at this
particular<00:02:52.220> valve<00:02:52.730> after<00:02:53.030> we've<00:02:53.360> wiped<00:02:53.540> away

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
particular valve after we've wiped away

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.620 
particular valve after we've wiped away
the<00:02:53.780> excess<00:02:54.170> oil<00:02:54.370> you're<00:02:55.370> looking<00:02:55.670> at<00:02:55.819> carbon

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
the excess oil you're looking at carbon

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.270 
the excess oil you're looking at carbon
deposits<00:02:56.750> and<00:02:57.290> if<00:02:57.470> we<00:02:57.560> take<00:02:57.680> a<00:02:57.740> razor<00:02:57.980> blade

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
deposits and if we take a razor blade

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.420 
deposits and if we take a razor blade
and<00:02:58.430> we<00:02:59.030> scrape<00:02:59.360> just<00:02:59.600> a<00:03:00.380> little<00:03:00.620> you<00:03:01.280> can

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
and we scrape just a little you can

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.050 
and we scrape just a little you can
start<00:03:01.670> to<00:03:01.790> see<00:03:01.970> the<00:03:02.090> carbon<00:03:02.380> forming<00:03:03.380> on<00:03:04.250> this

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
start to see the carbon forming on this

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.510 
start to see the carbon forming on this
valve<00:03:05.300> so<00:03:06.290> I've<00:03:06.440> got<00:03:06.620> a<00:03:06.650> problem<00:03:06.920> started<00:03:07.459> with

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
valve so I've got a problem started with

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:08.860 
valve so I've got a problem started with
this<00:03:07.670> I've<00:03:07.850> got<00:03:08.000> the<00:03:08.209> start<00:03:08.480> of<00:03:08.569> a<00:03:08.630> problem

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
this I've got the start of a problem

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.870 
this I've got the start of a problem
this<00:03:09.110> sled<00:03:09.380> runs<00:03:09.650> okay<00:03:09.980> right<00:03:10.190> now<00:03:10.370> but<00:03:10.730> it's

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
this sled runs okay right now but it's

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.150 
this sled runs okay right now but it's
not<00:03:11.060> going<00:03:11.180> to<00:03:11.239> stay<00:03:11.480> that<00:03:11.630> way<00:03:11.690> and<00:03:12.050> why<00:03:12.950> it's

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
not going to stay that way and why it's

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.620 
not going to stay that way and why it's
so<00:03:13.370> important<00:03:13.819> for<00:03:13.910> me<00:03:14.030> to<00:03:14.150> use<00:03:14.270> a<00:03:14.300> high

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
so important for me to use a high

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.390 
so important for me to use a high
quality<00:03:14.930> -<00:03:15.290> psycho<00:03:15.560> oil<00:03:15.800> like<00:03:15.980> Amazon

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
quality - psycho oil like Amazon

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.460 
quality - psycho oil like Amazon
interceptor<00:03:17.060> in<00:03:17.180> a<00:03:17.540> machine<00:03:17.840> just<00:03:17.870> like<00:03:18.260> this

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
interceptor in a machine just like this

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.830 
interceptor in a machine just like this
yeah<00:03:18.950> interceptor<00:03:19.760> is<00:03:19.940> formulated

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
yeah interceptor is formulated

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.530 
yeah interceptor is formulated
specifically<00:03:21.350> to<00:03:21.709> fight<00:03:21.980> this<00:03:22.250> problem<00:03:22.850> it's

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
specifically to fight this problem it's

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.080 
specifically to fight this problem it's
not<00:03:23.810> prone<00:03:24.170> to<00:03:24.200> depositing<00:03:24.950> you'll<00:03:25.250> see<00:03:25.519> you

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
not prone to depositing you'll see you

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:27.190 
not prone to depositing you'll see you
won't<00:03:26.209> see<00:03:26.540> any<00:03:26.780> of<00:03:26.870> this

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
won't see any of this

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.870 
won't see any of this
any<00:03:27.410> of<00:03:27.530> this<00:03:27.590> excessive<00:03:28.160> carbon<00:03:28.400> buildup

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
any of this excessive carbon buildup

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.729 
any of this excessive carbon buildup
like<00:03:29.060> we're<00:03:29.209> seeing<00:03:29.420> on<00:03:29.870> this<00:03:30.230> valve<00:03:30.440> and<00:03:30.590> like

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
like we're seeing on this valve and like

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:32.350 
like we're seeing on this valve and like
we<00:03:30.860> already<00:03:31.010> said<00:03:31.310> this<00:03:31.610> sled<00:03:31.819> still<00:03:32.150> works

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
we already said this sled still works

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.570 
we already said this sled still works
good<00:03:32.660> this<00:03:33.290> would<00:03:33.500> be<00:03:33.620> if<00:03:33.860> I<00:03:34.280> were<00:03:34.370> to<00:03:34.459> give<00:03:34.550> you

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
good this would be if I were to give you

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.160 
good this would be if I were to give you
the<00:03:34.730> example<00:03:35.000> of<00:03:35.269> let's<00:03:35.450> say<00:03:35.569> you<00:03:35.630> ran<00:03:35.870> over<00:03:35.930> a

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
the example of let's say you ran over a

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.580 
the example of let's say you ran over a
nail<00:03:37.600> maybe<00:03:38.600> the<00:03:38.810> air<00:03:38.989> is<00:03:39.140> going<00:03:39.260> to<00:03:39.319> stay<00:03:39.470> in

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
nail maybe the air is going to stay in

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:40.509 
nail maybe the air is going to stay in
your<00:03:39.680> tire<00:03:39.860> for<00:03:40.069> a<00:03:40.130> while<00:03:40.280> but<00:03:40.489> eventually

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
your tire for a while but eventually

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:41.710 
your tire for a while but eventually
it's<00:03:41.000> going<00:03:41.090> to<00:03:41.180> leak<00:03:41.330> out<00:03:41.450> of<00:03:41.510> there<00:03:41.660> and

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
it's going to leak out of there and

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.449 
it's going to leak out of there and
you're<00:03:41.840> going<00:03:41.930> to<00:03:41.989> have<00:03:42.140> a<00:03:42.170> problem<00:03:42.470> this

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
you're going to have a problem this

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:45.130 
you're going to have a problem this
particular<00:03:43.819> carbon<00:03:44.239> buildup<00:03:44.630> problem<00:03:44.989> is

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
particular carbon buildup problem is

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.860 
particular carbon buildup problem is
just<00:03:45.350> like<00:03:45.620> that<00:03:45.800> it<00:03:46.040> may<00:03:46.280> work<00:03:46.489> today<00:03:46.790> but<00:03:47.780> it

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
just like that it may work today but it

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.479 
just like that it may work today but it
may<00:03:47.989> not<00:03:48.019> work<00:03:48.170> tomorrow<00:03:48.680> or<00:03:48.920> the<00:03:49.190> next<00:03:49.220> day

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
may not work tomorrow or the next day

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:51.220 
may not work tomorrow or the next day
and<00:03:49.790> eventually<00:03:49.970> it's<00:03:50.690> probably<00:03:51.019> gonna<00:03:51.110> leave

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
and eventually it's probably gonna leave

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:52.539 
and eventually it's probably gonna leave
you<00:03:51.350> on<00:03:51.410> the<00:03:51.500> trail<00:03:51.709> and<00:03:51.950> it's<00:03:52.160> going<00:03:52.280> to<00:03:52.400> ruin

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
you on the trail and it's going to ruin

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:54.850 
you on the trail and it's going to ruin
my<00:03:52.820> day<00:03:52.880> it<00:03:53.269> is<00:03:53.450> so<00:03:53.720> one<00:03:53.900> last<00:03:54.079> question<00:03:54.290> land

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
my day it is so one last question land

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.360 
my day it is so one last question land
if<00:03:55.040> I<00:03:55.760> continue<00:03:56.630> to<00:03:56.660> let<00:03:56.959> that<00:03:57.110> problem<00:03:57.709> occur

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
if I continue to let that problem occur

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.210 
if I continue to let that problem occur
what<00:03:59.299> am<00:03:59.390> I<00:03:59.480> going<00:03:59.570> to<00:03:59.630> be<00:03:59.750> looking<00:03:59.989> at<00:04:00.110> then<00:04:00.350> if

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
what am I going to be looking at then if

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.130 
what am I going to be looking at then if
the<00:04:01.549> valves<00:04:01.880> stick<00:04:02.209> let's<00:04:02.540> say<00:04:02.690> they<00:04:02.780> stick<00:04:03.019> in

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
the valves stick let's say they stick in

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.569 
the valves stick let's say they stick in
a<00:04:03.200> closed<00:04:03.470> position<00:04:03.650> and<00:04:04.160> they're<00:04:04.250> stuck<00:04:04.489> in

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:04.579 
a closed position and they're stuck in

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:06.910 
a closed position and they're stuck in
the<00:04:04.670> exhaust<00:04:05.000> stream<00:04:05.360> you<00:04:06.019> see<00:04:06.230> excess<00:04:06.680> heat

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:06.920 
the exhaust stream you see excess heat

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.860 
the exhaust stream you see excess heat
buildup<00:04:07.250> we<00:04:07.610> see<00:04:07.850> all<00:04:08.030> kinds<00:04:08.390> of<00:04:08.450> issues<00:04:08.660> that
