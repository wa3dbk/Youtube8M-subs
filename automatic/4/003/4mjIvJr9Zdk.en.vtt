because<00:01:35.280> obviously<00:01:35.490> you're<00:01:35.759> going<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:35.970> be

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
because obviously you're going to be

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.300 
because obviously you're going to be
fighting<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.479> lot<00:01:36.630> of<00:01:36.750> ships<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.259> not<00:01:38.070> just

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
fighting a lot of ships and not just

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.219 
fighting a lot of ships and not just
with<00:01:38.490> your<00:01:38.610> canon<00:01:39.000> but<00:01:39.210> once<00:01:39.689> that<00:01:39.810> ship<00:01:40.079> is

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
with your canon but once that ship is

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.230 
with your canon but once that ship is
weakened<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:40.950> jump<00:01:41.220> aboard<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:41.790> your<00:01:42.000> crew

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240

jumps<00:01:42.570> aboard<00:01:42.659> with<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:43.110> so<00:01:43.590> it<00:01:43.710> makes<00:01:43.860> it

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
jumps aboard with you so it makes it

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.130 
jumps aboard with you so it makes it
easier<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.430> take<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:44.939> ship<00:01:45.270> if<00:01:45.420> you<00:01:45.450> have<00:01:45.720> a

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
easier to take a ship if you have a

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.410

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.580 
unfortunately there's lots of ways that
your<00:01:50.579> crew<00:01:50.759> can<00:01:51.000> die<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.479> they<00:01:51.990> can<00:01:52.409> die<00:01:52.560> in

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
your crew can die and they can die in

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.740 
your crew can die and they can die in
battle<00:01:52.890> of<00:01:53.189> course<00:01:53.399> but<00:01:53.579> also<00:01:53.759> in<00:01:54.060> storms<00:01:54.570> they

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
battle of course but also in storms they

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.389 
battle of course but also in storms they
can<00:01:54.899> fall<00:01:55.110> overboard<00:01:55.409> so<00:01:55.799> it's<00:01:55.950> important<00:01:56.340> to

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
can fall overboard so it's important to

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.719 
can fall overboard so it's important to
sail<00:01:56.759> through<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.479> storm<00:01:57.810> correctly<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.729> so

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
sail through a storm correctly and so

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.399 
sail through a storm correctly and so
you<00:02:00.000> need<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.270> keep<00:02:00.390> those<00:02:00.540> crew<00:02:00.750> levels<00:02:01.079> up<00:02:01.229> to

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
you need to keep those crew levels up to

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.039 
you need to keep those crew levels up to
have<00:02:01.799> success<00:02:02.219> as<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.490> pirate<00:02:02.850> so<00:02:03.450> you'll<00:02:03.689> try

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
have success as a pirate so you'll try

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.200 
have success as a pirate so you'll try
