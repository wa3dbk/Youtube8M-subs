 I will also explain to you 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.039
 attacked techniques are not 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.199
 interesting 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.879
 how to run a few lines i'm going 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.100
 to really give you all the details of 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.290

 what to do this sub for what on this 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.979
 choice there instead of doing that I'm going 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.170
 you learn to become someone from 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.869
 very powerful and very strong on that 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.400
 the champions I'm going to teach you to 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:22.619
 be able to climb very easily in the 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.390
 top 200 of the best French players 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.549
 I'm really going to give you a shot of 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.650
 hand be it for hdd guise where 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.930
 whether for smaller hdd I 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.360
 will teach you everything I 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.460
 know clash to the clan and it's going to be 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.409
 a series that will be broadcast once 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.549
 per week on my youtube channel then 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.950
 it will be an appointment we will give 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.890
 be every Wednesday heals all 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.780
 Sundays 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.010
 you have to see it will be all 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.450
 Wednesdays after always every 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.240
 allowed Wednesday from 5 pm 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.580
 every Sunday from 14 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.409
 hours I will publish the surveyor's 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.020
 dovahkiin on my youtube channel then 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:59.180
 to make it very simple I would have very 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.430
 well could start with episode 1 here I 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.840
 chose this technique of attacked then 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.060
 I will choose a tactics 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.310
 chance I choose the full dragon by 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.610
 example and I teach you how 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:13.010
 perform the best of the dragon crowds 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.810
 that exists on clash of enclosed why 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.970
 send that dragon there instead of sending 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.410
 this dragon there finally it finally changes 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.580
 why were we seeing there at 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.440
 place to send it to this place 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.450
 why send it for sure now and 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.650
 not learned she's going out to do with the 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.660
 foot dragon and how to use them 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.820
 as will use why 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.250
 send that if dragon instead of 7 and 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.989
 why send two dragons after 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.660
 why send his three months I'm going 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.250
 really where you detail on the 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.170
 techniques of attacking then I would have very 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.750
 well could start by although the other 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:45.980
 of the full dragon for example but I 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:48.019
 decided i want to excuse me for ben 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.760
 in fact this video finally this series 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:54.170
 who will be the expertise of our machines 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:56.120
 that would be it will be you who will vote for 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.170
 the data technique you have the most 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.750
 want to see 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.269
 so it's very simple you have in 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.280
 the description link straw poll and 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:06.049
 it's really very sad you have 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.540
 just to click on this link go to the 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:10.190
 link and you have before you a straw 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.930
 poll or early trot paul wrote 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.970
 that she technidata what do you want that 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.019
 I use and you have three choices the 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.370
 technical date is number 1 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:17.870
 the attac technique number of the 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.269
 painting technique 3 then there 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.829
 writes finally here I say 1 2 3 but you 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:23.510
 will have three different choices ie 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:24.650
 I give an example to chance the 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.959
 technique of the number 1 TAC that would be the 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.610
 full dragon the technique of number 2 that 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:31.220
 would be barbaric larcher and the technique 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:33.890
 datech tac number 3 it would be the gorilla 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.860
 yes or the gollogly the go away 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.540
 finally the golem sorcerer pk witch finally 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.430
 it would be something like that and you 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.530
 decide by voting for 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.109
 the attack technique that you want I 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:49.439
 you will learn these techniques then that 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:50.939
 is going to be very simple I know almost 

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:52.109
 all the attacking techniques of the game 

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:53.340
 I know all the strengths of the game 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:54.780
 all weak points etc 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.930
 I do not say that in me the fart in May 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.829
 just for conch where its end it's 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.760
 clear that I will not teach you 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:02.340
 something I do not know I 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.650
 know the frozen game well understand that 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.060
 is two and a half now jewelry 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.139
 suddenly back in among the three 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.900
 best French players I already have 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:11.159
 finally does 19 is really not bad of 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.989
 things so I'm going to teach you 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:15.599
 all the knowledge I have as 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:17.130
 that you can become even more 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:18.329
 powerful that you already want then 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.190
 in parentheses as you can see 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.870
 currently I do not have clans and 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.120
 it's a bit too that has slowed me down 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.680
 in teaching you one of 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.970
 better techniques because current 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.199
 to be able to teach you a 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.190
 technique you have to know how to play with a 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:31.139
 castle of flers the castle of end is 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.400
 returned very important in the game and a 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:33.479
 empty clan castle is not 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.680
 interesting to teach you the 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:36.150
 best techniques so I'm going 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.099
 first find me a clan because 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.900
 super single point fr it's over and 

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:41.099
 cetera who had the new year soon after 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.330
 I got sick so when I 

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:47.699
 got sick I had more votes for 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:49.550
 you do video and in short I 

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:51.870
 think you understood me and 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:53.130
 thirdly after there is trap to whom 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.030
 came to my house he came to spend a 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.010
 little weekend at home 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.129
 finally there were a lot of little things 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.629
 I had to help the 

00:04:58.129 --> 00:05:01.339
 finally I made a video I am 

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:03.349
 Charlie because I wanted 

00:05:01.339 --> 00:05:06.020
 to tell thank you to all 

00:05:03.349 --> 00:05:07.849
 to have listened to this little video that has 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.279
 been a lot of times shared and who has 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:11.989
 really been pretty much listened to 

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:14.509
 finally felt short we are not here to 

00:05:11.989 --> 00:05:15.919
 talk about it but good stuff there was 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:17.839

 compared to the little angina that I had 

00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:24.679
 in short 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:27.399
 so here you have a link straw poll 

00:05:24.679 --> 00:05:29.509
 in the description to select the 

00:05:27.399 --> 00:05:30.679
