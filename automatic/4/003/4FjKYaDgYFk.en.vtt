kingship at the site in 2010 our
archaeological<00:01:56.110> team<00:01:56.770> was<00:01:57.399> able<00:01:57.850> to<00:01:57.880> make<00:01:58.210> the

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
archaeological team was able to make the

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.770 
archaeological team was able to make the
first<00:01:59.049> 3d<00:01:59.530> topographical<00:02:00.340> map<00:02:01.000> of<00:02:01.240> the<00:02:01.539> site

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
first 3d topographical map of the site

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.289 
first 3d topographical map of the site
and<00:02:02.049> this<00:02:02.740> is<00:02:02.799> very<00:02:03.189> important<00:02:03.820> because<00:02:03.939> it

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 
and this is very important because it

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:07.649 
and this is very important because it
helps<00:02:04.630> us<00:02:04.750> to<00:02:04.810> identify<00:02:05.710> all<00:02:06.420> occupations<00:02:07.420> at

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
helps us to identify all occupations at

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.400 
helps us to identify all occupations at
the<00:02:07.810> site<00:02:08.050> all<00:02:08.970> architecture<00:02:10.019> and<00:02:11.019> it<00:02:11.200> also

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
the site all architecture and it also

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.710 
the site all architecture and it also
helps<00:02:12.310> us<00:02:12.519> to<00:02:13.349> target<00:02:14.880> future<00:02:15.880> excavations

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
helps us to target future excavations

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.949 
helps us to target future excavations
and<00:02:16.959> areas<00:02:17.739> that<00:02:18.040> might<00:02:18.280> be<00:02:18.750> important<00:02:19.750> in

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
and areas that might be important in

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.650 
and areas that might be important in
terms<00:02:20.680> of<00:02:21.069> what<00:02:21.489> they<00:02:21.670> might<00:02:21.910> tell<00:02:22.150> us<00:02:22.360> about

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
terms of what they might tell us about

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.800 
terms of what they might tell us about
the<00:02:22.900> past<00:02:23.170> and<00:02:23.620> so<00:02:24.400> this<00:02:24.610> is<00:02:24.760> also<00:02:24.970> these<00:02:25.299> 3d

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
the past and so this is also these 3d

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.990 
the past and so this is also these 3d
maps<00:02:26.110> are<00:02:26.350> also<00:02:26.680> very<00:02:26.920> important<00:02:27.489> for<00:02:27.670> us<00:02:27.760> in

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
maps are also very important for us in

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.390 
maps are also very important for us in
terms<00:02:28.030> of<00:02:29.819> knowing<00:02:30.819> the<00:02:32.190> relationships<00:02:33.190> of

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
terms of knowing the relationships of

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.370 
terms of knowing the relationships of
the<00:02:33.700> different<00:02:34.299> structures<00:02:34.690> at<00:02:34.900> the<00:02:34.930> site<00:02:35.019> to

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.039 
the site are the highest because that
would<00:02:44.440> be<00:02:44.849> the<00:02:45.849> most<00:02:46.510> preferential<00:02:47.470> place<00:02:47.739> for

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
would be the most preferential place for

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:51.030 
would be the most preferential place for
settlement<00:02:50.049> at<00:02:50.140> the<00:02:50.260> site<00:02:50.470> especially

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
settlement at the site especially

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.150 
settlement at the site especially
because<00:02:51.220> it<00:02:51.459> would<00:02:51.549> be<00:02:51.670> highly<00:02:52.060> defensible

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
because it would be highly defensible

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.630 
because it would be highly defensible
and<00:02:54.160> our<00:02:54.910> team<00:02:55.209> was<00:02:55.540> very<00:02:56.049> interested<00:02:56.950> in<00:02:56.980> the

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
and our team was very interested in the

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.660 
and our team was very interested in the
pre-classic<00:02:58.150> period<00:02:58.359> because<00:02:59.190> the<00:03:00.190> classic

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
pre-classic period because the classic

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.289 
pre-classic period because the classic
period<00:03:01.000> which<00:03:01.180> dates<00:03:01.480> to<00:03:01.690> about<00:03:01.780> 7<00:03:02.410> to<00:03:02.680> 900<00:03:03.340> AD

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
period which dates to about 7 to 900 AD

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:07.199 
period which dates to about 7 to 900 AD
has<00:03:05.230> been<00:03:05.470> very<00:03:05.709> heavily<00:03:06.100> studied<00:03:06.489> because<00:03:06.880> it

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
has been very heavily studied because it

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.949 
has been very heavily studied because it
does<00:03:07.390> have<00:03:07.720> kind<00:03:08.079> of<00:03:09.209> some<00:03:10.209> of<00:03:10.390> the<00:03:10.569> largest

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
does have kind of some of the largest

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:14.309 
does have kind of some of the largest
structures<00:03:11.950> the<00:03:12.220> largest<00:03:12.670> pyramids<00:03:13.319> rulers

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
structures the largest pyramids rulers

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.170 
structures the largest pyramids rulers
tombs<00:03:14.829> and<00:03:15.280> so<00:03:15.400> it<00:03:15.549> tends<00:03:15.819> to<00:03:15.940> be<00:03:16.150> very

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
tombs and so it tends to be very

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.900 
tombs and so it tends to be very
exciting<00:03:17.049> and<00:03:17.230> the<00:03:17.260> earlier<00:03:18.010> periods<00:03:18.579> for<00:03:18.850> a

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
exciting and the earlier periods for a

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.559 
exciting and the earlier periods for a
time<00:03:19.239> and<00:03:19.620> were<00:03:20.730> largely<00:03:21.730> ignored<00:03:22.299> of

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:22.569 
time and were largely ignored of

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:24.750 
time and were largely ignored of
although<00:03:23.200> of<00:03:23.380> course<00:03:23.410> there<00:03:23.920> are<00:03:24.069> exception

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:24.760 
although of course there are exception

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.140 
although of course there are exception
but<00:03:25.359> many<00:03:25.780> scholars<00:03:25.959> now<00:03:26.620> are<00:03:26.950> on<00:03:27.519> the<00:03:27.910> track

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
but many scholars now are on the track

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.110 
but many scholars now are on the track
of<00:03:28.420> looking<00:03:28.900> at<00:03:29.049> this<00:03:29.200> pre-classic<00:03:29.950> period

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
of looking at this pre-classic period

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.759 
of looking at this pre-classic period
finding<00:03:31.120> that<00:03:31.239> there<00:03:31.480> was<00:03:31.510> kingship<00:03:32.290> much

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
finding that there was kingship much

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.099 
finding that there was kingship much
earlier<00:03:33.250> than<00:03:33.340> previously<00:03:33.790> thought<00:03:34.239> there

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:35.109 
earlier than previously thought there

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:37.890 
earlier than previously thought there
was<00:03:35.290> monumental<00:03:36.040> architecture<00:03:36.420> much<00:03:37.420> earlier

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
was monumental architecture much earlier

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.009 
was monumental architecture much earlier
than<00:03:37.989> we<00:03:38.230> thought<00:03:38.700> and<00:03:39.700> and<00:03:40.019> archaeologists

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
than we thought and and archaeologists

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.530 
than we thought and and archaeologists
are<00:03:41.079> really<00:03:41.380> focusing<00:03:41.950> on<00:03:42.100> how<00:03:42.400> did<00:03:43.150> Kings

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
are really focusing on how did Kings

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:44.720 
are really focusing on how did Kings
come<00:03:44.019> to<00:03:44.260> power

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
come to power

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.870 
come to power
how<00:03:45.730> did<00:03:46.000> kingship<00:03:46.480> arise
