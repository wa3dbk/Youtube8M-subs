00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
using right now is a little bit thick so

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.500 
using right now is a little bit thick so
it<00:00:54.989> may<00:00:55.379> be<00:00:55.440> harder<00:00:55.980> for<00:00:56.010> you<00:00:56.430> to<00:00:56.460> be<00:00:57.000> folding

it may be harder for you to be folding

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.260 
it may be harder for you to be folding
but<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:58.559> definitely<00:00:58.949> can<00:00:59.460> make<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.730> sharper

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
but it definitely can make a sharper

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.180 
but it definitely can make a sharper

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
that can also work too so we're going to

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.940 
that can also work too so we're going to

folding paper especially in origami and
making<00:01:44.160> this<00:01:44.310> hard<00:01:44.610> you<00:01:44.880> want<00:01:45.030> everything<00:01:45.630> to

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
little fold can definitely make a

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.510 
little fold can definitely make a
difference<00:01:51.570> so<00:01:52.320> make<00:01:52.530> sure<00:01:52.560> that<00:01:52.740> you<00:01:53.040> have<00:01:53.250> as

open<00:02:24.840> it<00:02:24.870> back<00:02:24.959> up<00:02:25.430> now<00:02:26.430> that<00:02:26.610> we've<00:02:26.730> created<00:02:27.060> a

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
open it back up now that we've created a

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.449 
open it back up now that we've created a
nice<00:02:27.600> line<00:02:28.020> right<00:02:28.290> here<00:02:28.560> in<00:02:28.680> the<00:02:28.800> middle<00:02:28.830> we're

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
nice line right here in the middle we're

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:30.979 
nice line right here in the middle we're
going<00:02:29.580> to<00:02:29.670> go<00:02:29.790> ahead<00:02:29.820> and<00:02:30.030> take<00:02:30.360> our<00:02:30.570> right

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
going to go ahead and take our right

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.430 
going to go ahead and take our right
side<00:02:31.020> and<00:02:31.650> fold<00:02:32.370> it<00:02:32.550> up<00:02:32.760> put<00:02:33.060> in<00:02:33.780> this<00:02:34.080> side

side and fold it up put in this side

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:40.790 
side and fold it up put in this side
along<00:02:35.190> with<00:02:35.459> our<00:02:35.489> line<00:02:37.970> will<00:02:38.970> make<00:02:39.120> a<00:02:39.300> nice<00:02:39.800> 90

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
along with our line will make a nice 90

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.979 
along with our line will make a nice 90
degree<00:02:41.160> angle<00:02:41.610> triangle<00:02:42.239> look<00:02:42.600> right<00:02:42.959> here

make<00:02:43.980> sure<00:02:44.010> that<00:02:44.400> this<00:02:44.489> is<00:02:44.730> a<00:02:44.760> deep<00:02:45.209> line<00:02:45.920> this

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
make sure that this is a deep line this

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.690 
make sure that this is a deep line this
is<00:02:46.980> going<00:02:47.370> to<00:02:47.519> be<00:02:47.640> one<00:02:47.850> edge<00:02:48.060> of<00:02:48.269> your<00:02:48.390> heart

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
we're going to go ahead and flip it over

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:55.789 
we're going to go ahead and flip it over
and<00:02:53.750> we're<00:02:54.750> going<00:02:54.959> to<00:02:55.049> do<00:02:55.170> the<00:02:55.320> same<00:02:55.500> thing

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
and we're going to do the same thing

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:00.009 
and we're going to do the same thing
with<00:02:56.070> this<00:02:56.280> side<00:02:56.610> lining<00:02:57.480> up<00:02:57.570> at<00:02:57.720> the<00:02:57.840> line

with this side lining up at the line

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:03.100 
with this side lining up at the line
remember<00:03:01.019> to<00:03:01.290> make<00:03:01.470> all<00:03:01.680> of<00:03:01.739> your<00:03:02.310> corners

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
perfect right here in the bottom and

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.300 
perfect right here in the bottom and
make<00:03:06.870> sure<00:03:06.900> that<00:03:07.260> you<00:03:07.350> make<00:03:07.530> a<00:03:07.560> deep<00:03:07.920> crease

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
make sure that you make a deep crease

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.800 
make sure that you make a deep crease
because<00:03:08.549> this<00:03:08.820> is<00:03:08.970> going<00:03:09.239> to<00:03:09.390> be<00:03:09.480> the<00:03:09.630> other

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
because this is going to be the other

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:17.449 
because this is going to be the other
side<00:03:10.230> at<00:03:10.470> the<00:03:10.769> bottom<00:03:11.040> of<00:03:11.160> your<00:03:11.190> heart<00:03:16.459> now

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
we're going to go ahead and fold on this

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.080 
we're going to go ahead and fold on this
side<00:03:22.200> right<00:03:22.230> here<00:03:22.440> on<00:03:22.769> the<00:03:22.890> left<00:03:23.130> we're<00:03:23.940> going

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
side right here on the left we're going

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:30.350 
side right here on the left we're going
to<00:03:24.330> fold<00:03:24.600> it<00:03:24.750> down<00:03:28.340> just<00:03:29.340> to<00:03:29.580> make<00:03:29.790> a<00:03:29.820> little

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
to fold it down just to make a little

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:36.410 
to fold it down just to make a little
bit<00:03:30.480> of<00:03:30.540> another<00:03:31.440> corner

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.480 

and<00:03:36.660> now<00:03:37.140> we're<00:03:37.530> going<00:03:37.650> to<00:03:37.800> go<00:03:37.920> ahead<00:03:37.950> and<00:03:38.130> flip

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:38.490 
and now we're going to go ahead and flip

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:43.580 
and now we're going to go ahead and flip
and<00:03:38.760> do<00:03:39.030> the<00:03:39.180> next<00:03:39.480> side<00:03:40.520> so<00:03:41.520> flip<00:03:42.410> and<00:03:43.410> we're

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
and do the next side so flip and we're

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.460 
and do the next side so flip and we're
going<00:03:43.830> to<00:03:43.980> do<00:03:44.069> it<00:03:44.190> again<00:03:44.450> folding<00:03:45.450> to<00:03:46.200> the

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
going to do it again folding to the

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:52.670 
going to do it again folding to the
center<00:03:49.670> making<00:03:50.670> sure<00:03:51.030> to<00:03:51.209> keep<00:03:51.390> sharp<00:03:52.140> lines

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
center making sure to keep sharp lines

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.440 
center making sure to keep sharp lines
and<00:03:53.190> edges<00:03:55.220> alright<00:03:56.220> so<00:03:56.610> now<00:03:56.819> we're<00:03:57.120> going<00:03:57.300> to

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
and edges alright so now we're going to

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.580 
and edges alright so now we're going to
go<00:03:57.569> ahead<00:03:57.600> and<00:03:57.840> take<00:03:58.380> this<00:03:58.709> side<00:04:00.260> and<00:04:01.260> we're

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
go ahead and take this side and we're

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.410 
go ahead and take this side and we're
going<00:04:01.800> to<00:04:01.830> take<00:04:02.040> this<00:04:02.250> triangle<00:04:02.730> and<00:04:03.030> put<00:04:03.330> it

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
going to take this triangle and put it

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.930 
going to take this triangle and put it
down<00:04:03.660> here<00:04:03.900> into<00:04:04.080> the<00:04:04.350> opening<00:04:04.800> so<00:04:05.730> we're<00:04:05.910> just

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
down here into the opening so we're just

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.089 
down here into the opening so we're just
going<00:04:06.300> to<00:04:06.420> go<00:04:06.690> ahead<00:04:06.810> and<00:04:06.959> gently<00:04:07.440> squeeze

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
going to go ahead and gently squeeze

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:11.660 
going to go ahead and gently squeeze
that<00:04:08.310> in<00:04:08.519> there<00:04:09.230> and<00:04:10.230> push<00:04:10.560> it<00:04:10.680> down<00:04:10.830> as<00:04:11.069> far<00:04:11.489> as

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
that in there and push it down as far as

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.830 
that in there and push it down as far as
you<00:04:11.850> can<00:04:12.060> go<00:04:13.340> ahead<00:04:14.340> and<00:04:14.489> make<00:04:14.850> this<00:04:15.090> a<00:04:15.360> deep

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
you can go ahead and make this a deep

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:23.900 
you can go ahead and make this a deep
crease<00:04:21.350> we're<00:04:22.350> going<00:04:22.590> to<00:04:22.740> do<00:04:22.889> the<00:04:23.250> same<00:04:23.550> with

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
crease we're going to do the same with

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.640 
crease we're going to do the same with
this<00:04:24.090> side<00:04:24.150> but<00:04:24.750> we<00:04:24.840> need<00:04:24.990> to<00:04:25.050> flip<00:04:25.260> it<00:04:25.350> first

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
this side but we need to flip it first

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.250 
this side but we need to flip it first
because<00:04:26.550> the<00:04:26.760> opening<00:04:27.240> is<00:04:27.419> on<00:04:27.630> this<00:04:27.780> side<00:04:28.020> I

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
because the opening is on this side I

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.740 
because the opening is on this side I
also<00:04:29.250> want<00:04:29.490> to<00:04:29.520> remind<00:04:29.610> you<00:04:29.880> guys<00:04:29.970> that<00:04:30.389> when

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
also want to remind you guys that when

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.840 
also want to remind you guys that when
you're<00:04:30.900> folding<00:04:31.110> down<00:04:31.560> right<00:04:31.889> here<00:04:32.190> make<00:04:32.820> sure

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
you're folding down right here make sure

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.750 
you're folding down right here make sure
that<00:04:33.360> the<00:04:33.720> fold<00:04:34.020> goes<00:04:34.320> inward<00:04:34.860> and<00:04:35.070> has<00:04:35.550> the

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
that the fold goes inward and has the

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.990 
that the fold goes inward and has the
opening<00:04:36.240> right<00:04:36.419> there<00:04:37.220> just<00:04:38.220> in<00:04:38.400> case<00:04:38.430> you<00:04:38.850> may

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
opening right there just in case you may

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.360 
opening right there just in case you may
have<00:04:39.180> gotten<00:04:39.720> messed<00:04:40.169> up<00:04:40.440> so<00:04:41.039> we're<00:04:41.160> going<00:04:41.250> to

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
have gotten messed up so we're going to

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.450 
have gotten messed up so we're going to
go<00:04:41.400> ahead<00:04:41.550> and<00:04:41.669> fold<00:04:41.970> this<00:04:42.150> down<00:04:42.210> and<00:04:43.340> stuff<00:04:44.340> it

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
go ahead and fold this down and stuff it

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:51.980 
go ahead and fold this down and stuff it
in<00:04:44.550> all<00:04:44.700> the<00:04:44.729> way<00:04:48.169> and<00:04:50.090> make<00:04:51.090> our<00:04:51.300> deep<00:04:51.570> crease

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
in all the way and make our deep crease

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.360 
in all the way and make our deep crease
here<00:04:54.380> again<00:04:55.380> I'm<00:04:55.560> using<00:04:55.620> a<00:04:56.010> little<00:04:56.250> bit

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
here again I'm using a little bit

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:57.950 
here again I'm using a little bit
thicker<00:04:56.610> paper<00:04:56.910> so<00:04:57.270> I<00:04:57.330> have<00:04:57.539> to<00:04:57.660> apply<00:04:57.930> a

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
thicker paper so I have to apply a

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.159 
thicker paper so I have to apply a
little<00:04:58.229> bit<00:04:58.380> more<00:04:58.650> pressure<00:04:59.539> okay<00:05:00.539> so<00:05:00.960> we've

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169 
little bit more pressure okay so we've

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:03.740 
little bit more pressure okay so we've
got<00:05:01.380> the<00:05:01.620> basis<00:05:02.100> of<00:05:02.220> our<00:05:02.370> heart<00:05:02.640> now<00:05:02.850> now<00:05:03.510> we're

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
got the basis of our heart now now we're

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.159 
got the basis of our heart now now we're
going<00:05:03.840> to<00:05:03.900> go<00:05:03.960> ahead<00:05:04.110> and<00:05:04.400> flatten<00:05:05.690> this<00:05:06.690> right

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
going to go ahead and flatten this right

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:09.380 
going to go ahead and flatten this right
here<00:05:07.440> we're<00:05:07.620> going<00:05:07.770> to<00:05:07.919> flatten<00:05:08.310> this<00:05:08.610> so<00:05:09.300> you

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390 
here we're going to flatten this so you

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:11.210 
here we're going to flatten this so you
can<00:05:09.539> just<00:05:09.570> slip<00:05:09.870> your<00:05:09.930> finger<00:05:10.350> in<00:05:10.470> there<00:05:10.650> try

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
can just slip your finger in there try

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.700 
can just slip your finger in there try
and<00:05:11.250> find<00:05:11.550> the<00:05:11.729> middle<00:05:12.030> of<00:05:12.270> it<00:05:13.020> just<00:05:13.260> like<00:05:13.410> if

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
and find the middle of it just like if

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.040 
and find the middle of it just like if
you<00:05:13.890> were<00:05:14.010> to<00:05:14.130> fold<00:05:14.370> a<00:05:14.550> dollar<00:05:15.419> bills<00:05:15.720> into

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
you were to fold a dollar bills into

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:17.300 
you were to fold a dollar bills into
each<00:05:16.169> other<00:05:16.350> you<00:05:16.590> want<00:05:16.740> to<00:05:16.800> find<00:05:16.979> the<00:05:17.130> middle

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
each other you want to find the middle

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.719 
each other you want to find the middle
bill<00:05:17.580> and<00:05:17.910> then<00:05:18.870> open<00:05:19.650> it<00:05:19.710> up<00:05:19.919> so<00:05:20.460> would<00:05:20.700> you

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:20.729 
bill and then open it up so would you

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:23.210 
bill and then open it up so would you
just<00:05:20.910> open<00:05:21.180> it<00:05:21.570> just<00:05:21.810> like<00:05:22.020> that<00:05:22.229> no<00:05:23.100> one

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:23.220 
just open it just like that no one

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:24.440 
just open it just like that no one
should<00:05:23.370> go<00:05:23.430> ahead<00:05:23.610> and<00:05:23.700> make<00:05:23.910> it<00:05:24.030> a<00:05:24.120> little<00:05:24.270> bit

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:24.450 
should go ahead and make it a little bit

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:26.630 
should go ahead and make it a little bit
flat<00:05:24.780> on<00:05:24.960> the<00:05:25.050> top<00:05:25.229> don't<00:05:26.130> worry<00:05:26.310> too<00:05:26.610> much

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:26.640 
flat on the top don't worry too much

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.730 
flat on the top don't worry too much
about<00:05:26.880> you<00:05:27.810> know<00:05:27.870> making<00:05:28.020> creases<00:05:28.650> or

Glenn just put your finger in there a
little<00:05:37.830> bit<00:05:38.070> and<00:05:38.520> then<00:05:38.910> flatten<00:05:39.360> it<00:05:39.479> out<00:05:39.539> on

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 
little bit and then flatten it out on

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.190 
little bit and then flatten it out on
top<00:05:39.930> of<00:05:40.139> it<00:05:41.270> alright<00:05:42.270> so<00:05:42.510> we're<00:05:42.690> going<00:05:42.870> to<00:05:43.050> go

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:43.200 
top of it alright so we're going to go

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.159 
top of it alright so we're going to go
ahead<00:05:43.229> and<00:05:43.650> take<00:05:43.889> our<00:05:44.100> corners<00:05:44.669> and<00:05:45.169> indent

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:46.169 
ahead and take our corners and indent

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:48.110 
ahead and take our corners and indent
them<00:05:46.409> just<00:05:47.010> a<00:05:47.130> little<00:05:47.159> bit<00:05:47.610> so<00:05:47.789> you<00:05:47.849> can<00:05:48.000> put

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 
them just a little bit so you can put

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.239 
them just a little bit so you can put
your<00:05:48.210> finger<00:05:48.510> in<00:05:48.630> there<00:05:48.780> you<00:05:49.560> can<00:05:49.710> squeeze

your finger in there you can squeeze

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:57.589 
your finger in there you can squeeze
is<00:05:50.309> the<00:05:50.519> top<00:05:55.819> we're<00:05:56.819> going<00:05:56.969> to<00:05:57.119> do<00:05:57.239> the<00:05:57.359> same<00:05:57.389> on

00:05:57.589 --> 00:05:57.599 
is the top we're going to do the same on

00:05:57.599 --> 00:06:04.429 
is the top we're going to do the same on
the<00:05:57.869> side<00:06:00.889> and<00:06:02.869> we're<00:06:03.869> going<00:06:04.079> to<00:06:04.199> do<00:06:04.289> the<00:06:04.409> same

00:06:04.429 --> 00:06:04.439 
the side and we're going to do the same

00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:12.829 
the side and we're going to do the same
on<00:06:04.739> the<00:06:04.919> inside<00:06:05.119> corners<00:06:11.359> again<00:06:12.359> it<00:06:12.509> should<00:06:12.659> be

00:06:12.829 --> 00:06:12.839 
on the inside corners again it should be

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:15.499 
on the inside corners again it should be
easier<00:06:13.289> with<00:06:13.559> thinner<00:06:13.799> paper<00:06:14.069> I<00:06:14.579> am<00:06:14.969> using<00:06:15.389> a

00:06:15.499 --> 00:06:15.509 
easier with thinner paper I am using a

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:17.419 
easier with thinner paper I am using a
thicker<00:06:15.839> paper<00:06:16.049> just<00:06:16.469> because<00:06:16.709> I<00:06:16.859> wanted<00:06:17.279> to

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:17.429 
thicker paper just because I wanted to

00:06:17.429 --> 00:06:19.519 
thicker paper just because I wanted to
make<00:06:17.549> a<00:06:17.609> thick<00:06:17.939> or<00:06:18.119> heart<00:06:18.359> and<00:06:18.659> also<00:06:19.469> to

00:06:19.519 --> 00:06:19.529 
make a thick or heart and also to

00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:21.829 
make a thick or heart and also to
demonstrate<00:06:20.219> to<00:06:20.369> you<00:06:20.459> guys<00:06:20.669> that<00:06:20.969> there<00:06:21.539> is<00:06:21.809> a

00:06:21.829 --> 00:06:21.839 
demonstrate to you guys that there is a

00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:24.619 
demonstrate to you guys that there is a
difference<00:06:22.529> when<00:06:22.769> it<00:06:22.799> comes<00:06:22.919> to<00:06:23.489> the<00:06:24.209> folding

00:06:24.619 --> 00:06:24.629 
difference when it comes to the folding

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:26.689 
difference when it comes to the folding
especially<00:06:25.589> if<00:06:25.739> you're<00:06:25.919> using<00:06:25.949> thick<00:06:26.489> paper

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:26.699 
especially if you're using thick paper

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:29.149 
especially if you're using thick paper
could<00:06:27.269> be<00:06:27.419> a<00:06:27.449> little<00:06:27.629> bit<00:06:27.809> harder<00:06:28.110> so<00:06:29.099> I'm

00:06:29.149 --> 00:06:29.159 
could be a little bit harder so I'm

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:32.389 
could be a little bit harder so I'm
going<00:06:29.279> to<00:06:29.309> continue<00:06:29.639> and<00:06:30.059> do<00:06:30.239> my<00:06:30.389> other<00:06:31.399> inside

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:32.399 
going to continue and do my other inside

00:06:32.399 --> 00:06:34.399 
going to continue and do my other inside
corner<00:06:32.879> and<00:06:32.909> just<00:06:33.360> indent<00:06:33.809> that<00:06:34.049> in<00:06:34.199> a<00:06:34.289> little

00:06:34.399 --> 00:06:34.409 
corner and just indent that in a little

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:38.719 
corner and just indent that in a little
bit<00:06:34.589> and<00:06:35.089> voila<00:06:36.089> I've<00:06:36.479> got<00:06:36.839> a<00:06:36.869> paper<00:06:37.199> heart<00:06:37.729> it

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:38.729 
bit and voila I've got a paper heart it

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:41.959 
bit and voila I've got a paper heart it
looks<00:06:38.999> fantastic<00:06:39.299> but<00:06:40.199> it<00:06:41.009> could<00:06:41.399> come<00:06:41.639> apart

00:06:41.959 --> 00:06:41.969 
looks fantastic but it could come apart

00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:45.019 
looks fantastic but it could come apart
very<00:06:42.209> easily<00:06:42.389> so<00:06:43.019> i<00:06:43.439> suggest<00:06:44.009> to<00:06:44.219> you<00:06:44.399> to<00:06:44.610> just

00:06:45.019 --> 00:06:45.029 
very easily so i suggest to you to just

00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:47.719 
very easily so i suggest to you to just
use<00:06:45.239> one<00:06:45.689> little<00:06:45.839> piece<00:06:46.139> of<00:06:46.349> tape<00:06:46.559> just<00:06:47.489> going

00:06:47.719 --> 00:06:47.729 
use one little piece of tape just going

00:06:47.729 --> 00:06:49.219 
use one little piece of tape just going
to<00:06:47.789> go<00:06:47.909> ahead<00:06:47.969> and<00:06:48.119> take<00:06:48.359> one<00:06:48.689> little<00:06:48.899> tiny

00:06:49.219 --> 00:06:49.229 
to go ahead and take one little tiny

00:06:49.229 --> 00:06:51.889 
to go ahead and take one little tiny
piece<00:06:49.649> and<00:06:49.979> choose<00:06:50.819> a<00:06:50.849> side<00:06:51.209> it<00:06:51.509> doesn't

00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:51.899 
piece and choose a side it doesn't

00:06:51.899 --> 00:06:53.149 
piece and choose a side it doesn't
matter<00:06:51.959> it<00:06:52.199> can<00:06:52.289> be<00:06:52.409> this<00:06:52.589> one<00:06:52.769> or<00:06:53.009> this<00:06:53.099> one

00:06:53.149 --> 00:06:53.159 
matter it can be this one or this one
