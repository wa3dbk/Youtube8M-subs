00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
this is the standard fare aspire to

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.760 
this is the standard fare aspire to
netbook<00:00:33.690> scope<00:00:33.930> from<00:00:34.050> Samsung<00:00:34.500> it's<00:00:34.649> like

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
netbook scope from Samsung it's like

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.530 
netbook scope from Samsung it's like
their<00:00:34.920> most<00:00:35.100> basic<00:00:35.460> model<00:00:35.579> but<00:00:35.969> they<00:00:36.329> have

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
their most basic model but they have

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.360 
their most basic model but they have
made<00:00:36.809> some<00:00:37.140> incredible<00:00:37.379> improvements<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.280> the

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
made some incredible improvements to the

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.790 
made some incredible improvements to the
overall<00:00:38.670> design<00:00:38.820> it's<00:00:39.719> not<00:00:39.840> that<00:00:40.170> change<00:00:40.559> too

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
overall design it's not that change too

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.049 
overall design it's not that change too
much<00:00:40.829> it's<00:00:41.250> just<00:00:41.340> that<00:00:41.489> it's<00:00:41.610> been<00:00:41.670> it's<00:00:41.969> been

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
much it's just that it's been it's been

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.329 
much it's just that it's been it's been
refined<00:00:42.660> let's<00:00:42.960> say<00:00:43.170> also<00:00:43.890> you're<00:00:44.100> gonna<00:00:44.159> get

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:44.339 
refined let's say also you're gonna get

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:46.009 
refined let's say also you're gonna get
a<00:00:44.399> big<00:00:44.730> increase<00:00:45.059> in<00:00:45.149> battery<00:00:45.659> life<00:00:45.690> and

00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:46.019 
a big increase in battery life and

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:47.779 
a big increase in battery life and
that's<00:00:46.079> due<00:00:46.409> to<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.039> fact<00:00:47.219> that<00:00:47.370> Samsung<00:00:47.730> is

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
that's due to the fact that Samsung is

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.759 
that's due to the fact that Samsung is
using<00:00:48.059> their<00:00:48.149> own<00:00:48.179> LED<00:00:48.719> backed<00:00:48.929> LCD<00:00:49.350> monitors

00:00:49.759 --> 00:00:49.769 
using their own LED backed LCD monitors

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:51.590 
using their own LED backed LCD monitors
and<00:00:49.890> panels<00:00:50.190> inside<00:00:50.519> the<00:00:50.609> display<00:00:50.850> they're

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
and panels inside the display they're

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.079 
and panels inside the display they're
also<00:00:51.780> using<00:00:52.100> Samsung<00:00:53.100> batteries<00:00:53.550> Samsung

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:54.089 
also using Samsung batteries Samsung

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:55.520 
also using Samsung batteries Samsung
memory<00:00:54.420> basically<00:00:54.690> every<00:00:55.199> product<00:00:55.409> that

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
memory basically every product that

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.899 
memory basically every product that
Samsung<00:00:56.100> makes<00:00:56.190> just<00:00:56.370> about<00:00:56.519> everything

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:56.909 
Samsung makes just about everything

00:00:56.909 --> 00:00:58.849 
Samsung makes just about everything
including<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.479> hard<00:00:57.659> drives<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.769> know

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
including the hard drives you know

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.649 
including the hard drives you know
they've<00:00:59.129> included<00:00:59.429> all<00:00:59.729> of<00:01:00.030> their<00:01:00.149> components

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:00.659 
they've included all of their components

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:01.549 
they've included all of their components
to<00:01:00.749> into<00:01:00.989> making<00:01:01.140> one<00:01:01.319> of<00:01:01.379> these<00:01:01.440> little

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
to into making one of these little

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.439 
to into making one of these little
netbooks<00:01:01.949> now<00:01:02.100> this<00:01:02.519> is<00:01:02.729> using<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.120> latest

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
netbooks now this is using the latest

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.899 
netbooks now this is using the latest
Intel<00:01:04.350> Atom<00:01:04.920> processor<00:01:05.129> which<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:05.670> actually

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
Intel Atom processor which is actually

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:06.920 
Intel Atom processor which is actually
the<00:01:05.970> n450

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
the n450

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.600 
the n450
that<00:01:07.500> is<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.710> pine<00:01:07.950> trail<00:01:08.190> family<00:01:08.520> of

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
that is the pine trail family of

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.340 
that is the pine trail family of
processors<00:01:08.760> they're<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.750> little<00:01:10.049> bit<00:01:10.200> more

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
processors they're a little bit more

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.510 
processors they're a little bit more
efficient<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:10.740> they're<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.890> little<00:01:11.220> bit

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
efficient and they're a little bit

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.010 
efficient and they're a little bit
faster<00:01:12.060> they're<00:01:12.180> actually<00:01:12.390> one<00:01:12.540> point<00:01:12.750> six

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
faster they're actually one point six

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.260 
faster they're actually one point six
six<00:01:13.140> gigahertz<00:01:13.470> versus<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.159> old<00:01:14.340> n270<00:01:15.120> which

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
six gigahertz versus the old n270 which

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.620 
six gigahertz versus the old n270 which
is<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.390> 1.6<00:01:16.170> Giga<00:01:17.130> processor<00:01:17.640> so<00:01:17.880> basically

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
is a 1.6 Giga processor so basically

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.600 
is a 1.6 Giga processor so basically
getting<00:01:18.870> a<00:01:18.930> slightly<00:01:19.290> faster<00:01:19.410> processor<00:01:20.190> 1

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
getting a slightly faster processor 1

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.820 
getting a slightly faster processor 1
gigabyte<00:01:20.640> of<00:01:21.000> ddr2<00:01:21.360> memory<00:01:21.510> 160<00:01:22.500> gigabyte

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
gigabyte of ddr2 memory 160 gigabyte

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.020 
gigabyte of ddr2 memory 160 gigabyte
hard<00:01:23.010> drive<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.490> then<00:01:23.820> you're<00:01:23.940> getting

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
hard drive and then you're getting

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.550 
hard drive and then you're getting
n-draft<00:01:24.450> wireless<00:01:24.510> which<00:01:25.080> is<00:01:25.200> an<00:01:25.290> upgrade

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
n-draft wireless which is an upgrade

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.200 
n-draft wireless which is an upgrade
from<00:01:25.680> before<00:01:26.040> is<00:01:26.130> running<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.430> B<00:01:26.610> so<00:01:27.060> this<00:01:27.150> is

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
from before is running the B so this is

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.000 
from before is running the B so this is
actually<00:01:27.540> it's<00:01:27.720> gonna<00:01:27.840> go<00:01:28.050> 3<00:01:28.350> times<00:01:28.470> faster

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.010 
actually it's gonna go 3 times faster

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.980 
actually it's gonna go 3 times faster
actually<00:01:29.610> 3<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:29.940> 6<00:01:30.180> times<00:01:30.240> faster<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:30.900> it's

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
actually 3 to 6 times faster and it's

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.050 
actually 3 to 6 times faster and it's
gonna<00:01:31.110> triple<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.740> range<00:01:31.980> of<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.880> wireless

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
gonna triple the range of the wireless

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.580 
gonna triple the range of the wireless

more<00:03:11.670> USB<00:03:11.819> 2.0<00:03:12.360> ports<00:03:12.569> bringing<00:03:12.780> the<00:03:12.840> total<00:03:12.989> to

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
more USB 2.0 ports bringing the total to

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.630 
more USB 2.0 ports bringing the total to
three<00:03:13.470> which<00:03:13.709> is<00:03:13.799> pretty<00:03:13.950> much<00:03:14.069> standard<00:03:14.310> on

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
three which is pretty much standard on

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.220 
three which is pretty much standard on
most<00:03:15.150> netbooks<00:03:15.360> then<00:03:15.660> you<00:03:15.720> have<00:03:15.840> a<00:03:15.870> VGA<00:03:16.200> port

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
most netbooks then you have a VGA port

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.009 
most netbooks then you have a VGA port
and<00:03:17.160> then<00:03:17.280> finally<00:03:17.670> a<00:03:17.720> hole<00:03:18.720> here<00:03:18.870> for<00:03:18.989> a

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
and then finally a hole here for a

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:20.809 
and then finally a hole here for a
Kensington<00:03:19.200> lock<00:03:19.470> and<00:03:19.920> that's<00:03:20.280> basically<00:03:20.700> it

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
Kensington lock and that's basically it

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:23.360 
Kensington lock and that's basically it
now<00:03:21.209> on<00:03:21.330> the<00:03:21.420> back<00:03:21.860> the<00:03:22.860> battery<00:03:23.160> that<00:03:23.280> you're

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
now on the back the battery that you're

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.850 
now on the back the battery that you're
seeing<00:03:23.549> here<00:03:23.640> this<00:03:23.850> is<00:03:23.970> a<00:03:24.000> 6-cell<00:03:24.450> lithium-ion

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
seeing here this is a 6-cell lithium-ion

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.440 
seeing here this is a 6-cell lithium-ion
bags<00:03:25.860> and<00:03:26.010> give<00:03:26.100> you<00:03:26.190> about<00:03:26.310> seven<00:03:26.819> hours<00:03:27.269> of

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
battery life which is absolutely

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.190 
battery life which is absolutely
incredible<00:03:29.540> you<00:03:30.540> know<00:03:30.570> basically<00:03:30.959> the<00:03:31.049> same

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
incredible you know basically the same

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.550 
incredible you know basically the same
as<00:03:31.410> everything<00:03:31.739> else<00:03:31.859> it's<00:03:32.100> got<00:03:32.220> a<00:03:32.250> GMA<00:03:32.700> 3150

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
as everything else it's got a GMA 3150

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.020 
as everything else it's got a GMA 3150
intel<00:03:34.560> graphics<00:03:34.590> on<00:03:35.130> here<00:03:35.370> so<00:03:35.519> that<00:03:35.670> combined

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
intel graphics on here so that combined

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.940 
intel graphics on here so that combined
with<00:03:36.120> the<00:03:36.420> Atom<00:03:36.870> processor<00:03:36.900> 1<00:03:37.620> gigabyte<00:03:37.650> of

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
with the Atom processor 1 gigabyte of

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.650 
with the Atom processor 1 gigabyte of
memory<00:03:38.010> does<00:03:38.760> then<00:03:38.880> give<00:03:39.030> you<00:03:39.090> about<00:03:39.209> seven

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
memory does then give you about seven

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.690 
memory does then give you about seven
