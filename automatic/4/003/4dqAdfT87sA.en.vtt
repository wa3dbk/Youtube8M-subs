of<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.550> gentle<00:00:45.000> pull<00:00:45.329> so<00:00:46.110> what<00:00:46.260> you're<00:00:46.379> doing<00:00:46.410> is

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
of a gentle pull so what you're doing is

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.260 
of a gentle pull so what you're doing is
you're<00:00:46.860> just<00:00:46.890> pulling<00:00:47.309> into<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.789> fish<00:00:48.030> and

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
you're just pulling into the fish and

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.119 
you're just pulling into the fish and
the<00:00:48.629> best<00:00:48.840> way<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.020> do<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.410> is<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.620> do<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.800> low

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
the best way to do it is to do a low

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.850 
the best way to do it is to do a low
sweep<00:00:50.640> of<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.000> rod<00:00:51.210> so<00:00:51.930> in<00:00:52.230> this<00:00:52.350> case<00:00:52.620> I'd

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
sweep of the rod so in this case I'd

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.040 
sweep of the rod so in this case I'd
sweep<00:00:53.100> it<00:00:53.309> around<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.820> left<00:00:54.030> nice<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:54.930> low

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
sweep it around to the left nice and low

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.709 
sweep it around to the left nice and low
to<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.289> water<00:00:55.430> so<00:00:56.430> you're<00:00:56.550> not<00:00:56.699> pulling<00:00:57.510> the

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
to the water so you're not pulling the

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.450 
to the water so you're not pulling the
float<00:00:57.960> too<00:00:58.199> hard<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.739> you're<00:00:58.890> not<00:00:59.039> risking

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
float too hard and you're not risking

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.340 
float too hard and you're not risking
dragging<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.180> float<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.660> flying<00:01:01.020> out<00:01:01.230> the

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
dragging the float and flying out the

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:09.380 
dragging the float and flying out the
water<00:01:01.530> if<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:01.829> miss<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.129> bike<00:01:03.500> okay<00:01:08.270> so<00:01:09.270> they

might want to do more of an upward
strike<00:03:27.060> because<00:03:27.510> you've<00:03:27.599> got<00:03:27.689> a<00:03:27.719> lot<00:03:27.930> of<00:03:28.049> line

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
strike because you've got a lot of line

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.869 
strike because you've got a lot of line
to<00:03:28.530> pick<00:03:28.680> up<00:03:28.890> before<00:03:29.250> you<00:03:29.340> connect<00:03:29.670> with<00:03:29.730> the

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:29.879 
to pick up before you connect with the

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:31.849 
to pick up before you connect with the
fish<00:03:30.060> in<00:03:30.299> this<00:03:30.599> case<00:03:30.780> there's<00:03:31.019> a<00:03:31.079> bite<00:03:31.260> and<00:03:31.500> a

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
fish in this case there's a bite and a

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:33.649 
fish in this case there's a bite and a
strike<00:03:32.159> and<00:03:32.370> you've<00:03:32.519> got<00:03:32.670> it<00:03:32.819> so<00:03:33.269> it's<00:03:33.450> a<00:03:33.480> nice

00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:33.659 
strike and you've got it so it's a nice

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:41.530 
strike and you've got it so it's a nice
smooth<00:03:35.120> we<00:03:36.120> got<00:03:36.299> it<00:03:36.450> now<00:03:36.480> I<00:03:38.900> plant<00:03:39.900> the<00:03:40.019> hot

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
smooth we got it now I plant the hot

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:56.090 
smooth we got it now I plant the hot
here<00:03:42.540> one<00:03:43.139> more<00:03:43.290> go

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.760 

I<00:03:56.180> cast<00:03:57.180> again<00:03:57.450> now<00:03:58.020> leave<00:03:58.230> it<00:03:58.350> there<00:03:58.470> leave<00:03:58.500> it

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:58.770 
I cast again now leave it there leave it

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.700 
I cast again now leave it there leave it
there<00:03:58.890> just<00:03:59.790> tighten<00:04:00.210> up<00:04:00.300> to<00:04:00.480> it<00:04:00.660> so<00:04:01.410> there<00:04:01.650> you

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:01.710 
there just tighten up to it so there you

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:10.310 
there just tighten up to it so there you
go<00:04:01.830> stop<00:04:02.130> and<00:04:02.400> then<00:04:03.390> what's<00:04:03.870> your<00:04:04.020> float<00:04:09.320> so

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
go stop and then what's your float so

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.080 
go stop and then what's your float so
what's<00:04:10.500> happening<00:04:10.800> is<00:04:10.950> the<00:04:10.980> maggots<00:04:11.460> your

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
what's happening is the maggots your

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.360 
what's happening is the maggots your
hook<00:04:12.240> baits<00:04:12.480> falling<00:04:13.380> nice<00:04:13.560> and<00:04:13.800> slowly<00:04:14.040> with

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
hook baits falling nice and slowly with

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.780 
hook baits falling nice and slowly with
the<00:04:14.520> other<00:04:14.870> feed<00:04:15.870> that<00:04:16.050> we've<00:04:16.200> fed<00:04:16.550> just<00:04:17.550> those

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
the other feed that we've fed just those

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.150 
the other feed that we've fed just those
small<00:04:18.480> shutters<00:04:19.170> just<00:04:19.380> settling<00:04:19.739> everything

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
small shutters just settling everything

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.590 
small shutters just settling everything
down<00:04:20.340> nicely<00:04:20.610> you<00:04:21.420> can<00:04:21.600> see<00:04:21.780> the<00:04:21.959> float<00:04:22.200> now

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
down nicely you can see the float now

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:34.549 
down nicely you can see the float now
and<00:04:24.620> hopefully<00:04:25.620> we'll<00:04:25.890> get<00:04:25.980> a<00:04:26.040> bite

00:04:34.549 --> 00:04:34.559 

00:04:34.559 --> 00:04:37.279 

when<00:04:35.129> I<00:04:35.249> strike<00:04:35.759> to<00:04:35.969> the<00:04:36.089> left<00:04:36.359> do<00:04:36.689> I<00:04:36.719> really

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:37.289 
when I strike to the left do I really

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:39.499 
when I strike to the left do I really
and<00:04:37.439> while<00:04:37.559> I<00:04:37.589> strike<00:04:38.069> no<00:04:38.339> no<00:04:38.819> strike<00:04:39.149> first

00:04:39.499 --> 00:04:39.509 
and while I strike no no strike first

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:41.869 
and while I strike no no strike first
yeah<00:04:40.079> until<00:04:40.349> you<00:04:40.559> feel<00:04:40.799> the<00:04:40.949> fish<00:04:41.189> and<00:04:41.459> then

00:04:41.869 --> 00:04:41.879 
yeah until you feel the fish and then

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:45.079 
yeah until you feel the fish and then
gradually<00:04:42.539> really<00:04:43.199> and<00:04:43.399> to<00:04:44.399> make<00:04:44.579> contact

00:04:45.079 --> 00:04:45.089 
gradually really and to make contact

00:04:45.089 --> 00:04:46.699 
gradually really and to make contact
with<00:04:45.179> the<00:04:45.329> fish<00:04:45.509> and<00:04:45.689> determine<00:04:46.259> how<00:04:46.409> big<00:04:46.559> it

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:46.709 
with the fish and determine how big it

00:04:46.709 --> 00:04:50.379 
with the fish and determine how big it
is<00:04:46.739> there<00:04:47.069> you<00:04:47.129> go<00:04:47.279> strike<00:04:47.959> have<00:04:48.959> we<00:04:49.079> got<00:04:49.229> it

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:50.389
