 the end and the street became much warmer 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.770
 what can not be said about the battlefields 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.020
 league of legends in the last issue we 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.369
 told you about the new winter map and 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.890

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:28.410
 lissandra ice witch self-confident 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.769
 snow princess thinks that the world 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.420
 after the fall reborn in the ice 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:35.340

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.710
 disaster management experience 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:42.149
 so we just followed lissandra 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:44.280
 closed their eyes and the ice devoured us the champion 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.829
 is a typical magician 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.800
 depending on the strength of the skill and having 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.710
 huge amount of control 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:55.500
 let's take a closer look at his iphoine skills 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.140
 passive ability every 18 seconds 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.960
 lissandra can use skill without 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.390
 mana costs if the enemy is slow or 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.600
 immobilized with help and skills that time 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.640
 recharge axis pain is reduced given 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.400
 the effect does not work when activated 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:15.750
 objects and the presence of red lissandra 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:18.060
 buff sang from a chance was a shorthand alexander 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.280
 throws an ice spear at the enemy 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.009
 crumbles in collision causes 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.049
 damage and slows the target splinters spears 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:28.470
 also deals damage to enemies standing 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.600
 behind the goal and y and wreath growth skill 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.369
 immobilizes enemies around lissandra on 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.930
 some time and deals magic 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.939
 damage 3 eye skill dropped at first 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.630
 activation champion directs icy 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.670
 claw 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.729
 which slowly passes through enemies 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.829
 inflicting magical damage on reuse 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.880
 Lesandra activation moves to 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.789
 current krishna position 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.920
 your ultimate fausen champ can 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:56.439
 use both on the opponent and on 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.869
 yourself when using Ultimate on 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:02.110
 enemy lysander and puts it in the icy 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:04.360
 the tomb the enemy is stunned and the tomb 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.250
 begins to exude dark ice which in 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.140
 for a few seconds put 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.599
 magical damage to nearby enemies 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.569
 and slows their movement speed 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:16.090
 if lissandra puts himself in the tomb 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.730
 then she becomes invulnerable and the following 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:22.480
 a half second ice coming from the tomb 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.340
 have a similar effect as any 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.959
 the loss of lesander is most comfortable 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.360
 feels like mid 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:31.780

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:34.000
 I want to note that manacost and 3 of 4 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.950
 Alessandro's skills are the same for everyone. 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.440
 levels and quite expensive 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.630
 surely passive ability of a champion 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.230
 helps but to get more 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.970
