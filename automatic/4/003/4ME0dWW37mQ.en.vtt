next<00:07:07.190> part<00:07:07.550> is<00:07:07.610> i<00:07:07.759> think<00:07:07.789> it's<00:07:08.060> i<00:07:08.330> think<00:07:08.360> that

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:08.630 
next part is i think it's i think that

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:10.480 
next part is i think it's i think that
might<00:07:08.780> you<00:07:08.930> just<00:07:08.960> might<00:07:09.139> play<00:07:09.590> the<00:07:09.620> piranhas

might you just might play the piranhas
i'm<00:07:10.910> not<00:07:11.060> quite<00:07:11.240> sure<00:07:11.270> I<00:07:11.389> think<00:07:11.570> you<00:07:11.630> just<00:07:11.780> play

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:11.930 
i'm not quite sure I think you just play

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:13.160 
the course and that's the end of the

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.159 
the course and that's the end of the
song<00:07:13.340> so<00:07:13.639> now<00:07:14.330> i<00:07:14.419> might<00:07:14.509> be<00:07:14.660> wrong<00:07:14.690> about<00:07:15.050> that

00:07:15.159 --> 00:07:15.169 
song so now i might be wrong about that
