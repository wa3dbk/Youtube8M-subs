that<00:01:27.130> I<00:01:27.280> do<00:01:27.399> is<00:01:27.729> I<00:01:27.850> place<00:01:27.909> the<00:01:28.359> fabric<00:01:28.570> over<00:01:28.990> the

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
that I do is I place the fabric over the

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:31.440 
that I do is I place the fabric over the
foam<00:01:29.649> board<00:01:29.950> then<00:01:30.610> I'm<00:01:30.729> going<00:01:30.880> to<00:01:30.939> cut<00:01:31.270> about

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
foam board then I'm going to cut about

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.100 
foam board then I'm going to cut about
two<00:01:31.990> inches<00:01:32.590> out<00:01:33.039> from<00:01:33.820> the<00:01:33.969> foam<00:01:34.179> board<00:01:34.509> so

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
two inches out from the foam board so

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.959 
two inches out from the foam board so
that<00:01:35.259> way<00:01:35.439> I<00:01:35.469> leave<00:01:35.740> enough<00:01:35.890> space<00:01:36.039> to<00:01:36.579> wrap<00:01:36.789> it

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:36.969 
that way I leave enough space to wrap it

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:42.809

my base so what I do is spray it with
the<00:02:40.620> lock<00:02:40.950> light<00:02:41.190> and<00:02:41.400> then<00:02:41.640> I<00:02:41.880> turn<00:02:42.210> it<00:02:42.390> over

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
the lock light and then I turn it over

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.750 
the lock light and then I turn it over
directly<00:02:43.290> onto<00:02:43.500> the<00:02:43.710> fabric<00:02:43.920> I<00:02:44.250> placed<00:02:44.610> it

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
directly onto the fabric I placed it

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.280 
directly onto the fabric I placed it
gently<00:02:44.790> because<00:02:45.450> I'm<00:02:45.690> going<00:02:45.840> to<00:02:45.900> apply<00:02:46.230> this

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
gently because I'm going to apply this

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.580 
gently because I'm going to apply this
like<00:02:46.740> a<00:02:46.770> decal<00:02:47.400> I<00:02:47.640> gently<00:02:48.480> lift<00:02:48.900> up<00:02:49.110> the<00:02:49.320> fabric

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
like a decal I gently lift up the fabric

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.580 
like a decal I gently lift up the fabric
and<00:02:49.980> then<00:02:50.190> place<00:02:50.580> it<00:02:50.610> back<00:02:50.850> down<00:02:51.210> lined<00:02:52.200> up<00:02:52.440> as

much<00:02:52.800> as<00:02:52.980> possible<00:02:53.190> and<00:02:53.670> then<00:02:53.880> I<00:02:53.970> take<00:02:54.300> a<00:02:54.510> piece

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
much as possible and then I take a piece

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:12.940 
much as possible and then I take a piece
of<00:02:54.990> foam<00:02:55.290> board<00:02:55.560> to<00:02:55.830> smooth<00:02:56.130> out<00:02:56.250> any<00:02:56.460> air

the<00:03:23.430> foam<00:03:23.580> board<00:03:24.000> just<00:03:24.330> to<00:03:24.480> make<00:03:24.629> sure<00:03:24.659> that<00:03:24.989> it

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
the foam board just to make sure that it

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:39.619 
the foam board just to make sure that it
stays<00:03:25.379> down<00:03:37.579> for<00:03:38.579> added<00:03:38.940> style<00:03:39.180> and<00:03:39.480> to

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:39.629 
stays down for added style and to

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:40.550 
stays down for added style and to
prevent<00:03:39.989> fraying

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
prevent fraying

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.440 
prevent fraying
I'm<00:03:40.620> going<00:03:40.920> to<00:03:41.040> be<00:03:41.129> using<00:03:41.489> some<00:03:41.700> fabric<00:03:42.150> to

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
I'm going to be using some fabric to

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.509 
I'm going to be using some fabric to
line<00:03:42.720> the<00:03:43.079> sides<00:03:43.379> of<00:03:43.650> each<00:03:43.890> of<00:03:44.099> the<00:03:44.310> pieces

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
line the sides of each of the pieces

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.759 
line the sides of each of the pieces
first<00:03:45.180> I<00:03:45.420> determine<00:03:45.840> how<00:03:45.959> far<00:03:46.230> I<00:03:46.410> want<00:03:46.650> the

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
first I determine how far I want the

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:48.559 
first I determine how far I want the
fabric<00:03:46.950> to<00:03:47.250> come<00:03:47.430> down<00:03:47.670> on<00:03:47.910> the<00:03:48.060> piece<00:03:48.299> and

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
fabric to come down on the piece and

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:51.400 
fabric to come down on the piece and
then<00:03:49.290> I'll<00:03:49.530> measure<00:03:49.829> it<00:03:49.980> out<00:03:50.220> and<00:03:50.549> cut<00:03:50.879> it<00:03:50.910> out

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
then I'll measure it out and cut it out

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.199 
then I'll measure it out and cut it out
then<00:03:52.410> I'll<00:03:52.680> use<00:03:53.010> that<00:03:53.250> same<00:03:53.549> piece<00:03:53.849> of<00:03:54.030> fabric

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
then I'll use that same piece of fabric

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.900 
then I'll use that same piece of fabric
to<00:03:54.660> cut<00:03:54.870> out<00:03:55.019> subsequent<00:03:55.590> pieces<00:03:55.769> this<00:03:56.579> saves

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
to cut out subsequent pieces this saves

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:07.490 
to cut out subsequent pieces this saves
me<00:03:57.030> time<00:04:05.180> to<00:04:06.180> prevent<00:04:06.599> fraying<00:04:06.900> what<00:04:07.410> I'm

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
me time to prevent fraying what I'm

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.589 
me time to prevent fraying what I'm
going<00:04:07.650> to<00:04:07.680> do<00:04:07.950> is<00:04:08.160> take<00:04:08.459> some<00:04:08.730> hot<00:04:08.940> glue<00:04:09.209> and

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
going to do is take some hot glue and

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:12.289 
going to do is take some hot glue and
put<00:04:10.170> it<00:04:10.290> on<00:04:10.440> the<00:04:10.620> edge<00:04:10.799> of<00:04:11.129> the<00:04:11.370> fabric<00:04:11.819> then

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:12.299 
put it on the edge of the fabric then

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:27.450 
put it on the edge of the fabric then
I'm<00:04:12.420> going<00:04:12.569> to<00:04:12.599> fold<00:04:12.870> the<00:04:13.049> fabric<00:04:13.500> up

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:33.570 

this<00:04:28.460> is<00:04:28.639> what<00:04:28.789> it<00:04:28.879> looks<00:04:29.060> like<00:04:29.210> once<00:04:29.479> I<00:04:29.720> finish

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.460 

next<00:04:34.580> I<00:04:34.789> gather<00:04:35.000> all<00:04:35.240> of<00:04:35.270> my<00:04:35.539> pieces<00:04:35.810> and<00:04:36.199> I

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
next I gather all of my pieces and I

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.890 
next I gather all of my pieces and I
fold<00:04:36.800> them<00:04:37.039> in<00:04:37.280> half<00:04:38.289> then<00:04:39.289> I<00:04:39.530> earned<00:04:40.099> them<00:04:40.280> I'm

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
fold them in half then I earned them I'm

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.270 
fold them in half then I earned them I'm
creating<00:04:41.900> a<00:04:41.990> crease<00:04:42.289> to<00:04:42.500> make<00:04:42.530> them<00:04:42.830> easier<00:04:43.220> to

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
creating a crease to make them easier to

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.330 
creating a crease to make them easier to
attach<00:04:43.819> and<00:04:44.379> make<00:04:45.379> sure<00:04:45.530> that<00:04:45.650> I<00:04:45.710> continuously

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
attach and make sure that I continuously

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.339 
attach and make sure that I continuously
line<00:04:46.729> up<00:04:46.879> the<00:04:47.000> fabric<00:04:47.240> so<00:04:47.690> that<00:04:47.720> the<00:04:47.900> crease

00:04:48.339 --> 00:04:48.349 
line up the fabric so that the crease

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:50.290 
line up the fabric so that the crease
falls<00:04:48.680> directly<00:04:48.889> in<00:04:49.310> the<00:04:49.430> middle<00:04:49.550> I<00:04:49.789> make<00:04:50.150> sure

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
falls directly in the middle I make sure

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.629 
falls directly in the middle I make sure
that<00:04:50.419> each<00:04:50.690> side<00:04:50.990> is<00:04:51.259> directly<00:04:51.800> on<00:04:51.949> top<00:04:52.220> of<00:04:52.250> one

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:52.639 
that each side is directly on top of one

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:53.200 
that each side is directly on top of one
another

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
another

00:04:53.210 --> 00:05:02.890 
another
I<00:05:00.580> then<00:05:01.580> spray<00:05:01.970> the<00:05:02.000> piece<00:05:02.330> with<00:05:02.599> spray

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
I then spray the piece with spray

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.649 
I then spray the piece with spray
adhesive<00:05:02.930> I<00:05:03.590> then<00:05:04.340> line<00:05:04.639> up<00:05:04.849> the<00:05:05.180> crease<00:05:05.449> and

00:05:05.649 --> 00:05:05.659 
adhesive I then line up the crease and

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:07.510 
adhesive I then line up the crease and
the<00:05:05.720> side<00:05:06.199> of<00:05:06.470> the<00:05:06.590> foam<00:05:06.800> board<00:05:07.159> with<00:05:07.340> one

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
the side of the foam board with one

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.209 
the side of the foam board with one
another<00:05:07.789> I<00:05:08.030> press<00:05:08.840> it<00:05:09.020> directly<00:05:09.349> on<00:05:09.590> to<00:05:10.039> the

00:05:10.209 --> 00:05:10.219 
another I press it directly on to the

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:12.309 
another I press it directly on to the
foam<00:05:10.430> board<00:05:10.729> and<00:05:11.060> then<00:05:11.479> smooth<00:05:11.900> down<00:05:12.110> the

00:05:12.309 --> 00:05:12.319 
foam board and then smooth down the

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:24.029 
foam board and then smooth down the
sides

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:24.039 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:29.519 

I<00:05:27.180> continue<00:05:28.180> to<00:05:28.210> do<00:05:28.449> this<00:05:28.599> process<00:05:28.869> for<00:05:29.169> all

00:05:29.519 --> 00:05:29.529 
I continue to do this process for all

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:34.010 
I continue to do this process for all
remaining<00:05:29.919> pieces

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:42.440 

I<00:05:39.560> put<00:05:40.560> the<00:05:40.680> bottom<00:05:40.860> piece<00:05:41.250> in<00:05:41.490> first<00:05:41.940> because

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:42.450 
I put the bottom piece in first because

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:44.600 
I put the bottom piece in first because
that<00:05:42.660> makes<00:05:42.840> it<00:05:42.990> a<00:05:43.110> lot<00:05:43.290> simpler<00:05:43.710> and<00:05:44.010> then<00:05:44.580> I

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 
that makes it a lot simpler and then I

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.690 
that makes it a lot simpler and then I
pushed<00:05:45.000> in<00:05:45.180> the<00:05:45.480> back<00:05:45.690> side<00:05:46.080> piece<00:05:46.530> after<00:05:46.830> that

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:47.700 
pushed in the back side piece after that

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.790 
pushed in the back side piece after that
I<00:05:47.730> put<00:05:48.090> in<00:05:48.240> the<00:05:48.390> left<00:05:48.630> and<00:05:48.930> right<00:05:49.170> side<00:05:49.500> pieces

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
I put in the left and right side pieces

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.880 
I put in the left and right side pieces
and<00:05:50.250> then<00:05:50.850> I<00:05:50.940> put<00:05:51.180> in<00:05:51.300> all<00:05:51.450> the<00:05:51.630> dividers<00:05:52.110> my

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:52.890 
and then I put in all the dividers my

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:54.830 
and then I put in all the dividers my
right<00:05:53.190> piece<00:05:53.490> actually<00:05:53.700> was<00:05:54.210> a<00:05:54.360> little<00:05:54.690> too

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 
right piece actually was a little too

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.290 
right piece actually was a little too
big<00:05:55.080> so<00:05:55.440> I<00:05:55.680> cut<00:05:56.160> off<00:05:56.370> the<00:05:56.580> excess<00:05:56.970> with<00:05:57.180> an

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 
big so I cut off the excess with an

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.110 
big so I cut off the excess with an
exacto<00:05:57.870> knife<00:05:58.080> and<00:05:58.340> then<00:05:59.340> I<00:05:59.520> just<00:05:59.880> played

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:00.120 
exacto knife and then I just played

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.810 
exacto knife and then I just played
around<00:06:00.510> with<00:06:00.690> smaller<00:06:01.230> pieces<00:06:01.650> you<00:06:02.490> can<00:06:02.670> do<00:06:02.790> a

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:02.820 
around with smaller pieces you can do a

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:04.880 
around with smaller pieces you can do a
lot<00:06:03.090> of<00:06:03.120> different<00:06:03.420> things<00:06:03.900> I<00:06:04.140> came<00:06:04.500> up<00:06:04.860> with

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:04.890 
lot of different things I came up with

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:07.460 
lot of different things I came up with
about<00:06:05.310> three<00:06:05.670> different<00:06:06.150> options<00:06:06.470> or

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:07.470 
about three different options or

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:10.130 
about three different options or
organizing<00:06:08.280> my<00:06:08.430> drawer<00:06:08.850> the<00:06:09.450> first<00:06:09.720> was<00:06:09.930> this

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:10.140 
organizing my drawer the first was this

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:21.350 
organizing my drawer the first was this
one<00:06:12.200> this<00:06:13.200> was<00:06:13.500> the<00:06:13.650> second<00:06:14.070> one<00:06:14.250> I<00:06:20.270> figured<00:06:21.270> it

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 
one this was the second one I figured it

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.000 
one this was the second one I figured it
would<00:06:21.480> look<00:06:21.660> nicer<00:06:22.110> with<00:06:22.290> one<00:06:22.470> more<00:06:22.650> divider

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.010 
would look nicer with one more divider

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:25.490 
would look nicer with one more divider
and<00:06:23.340> ultimately<00:06:23.850> I<00:06:24.120> decided<00:06:24.210> on<00:06:24.840> this<00:06:25.050> one<00:06:25.290> the

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:25.500 
and ultimately I decided on this one the

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.560 
and ultimately I decided on this one the
two<00:06:25.680> small<00:06:25.980> pieces<00:06:26.250> can<00:06:26.670> fall<00:06:26.940> down<00:06:27.180> so<00:06:27.540> I

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:27.570 
two small pieces can fall down so I

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:29.810 
two small pieces can fall down so I
decided<00:06:28.170> to<00:06:28.290> measure<00:06:28.770> exactly<00:06:29.550> where<00:06:29.700> they

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:29.820 
decided to measure exactly where they

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:32.120 
decided to measure exactly where they
were<00:06:29.880> and<00:06:30.270> then<00:06:30.930> glue<00:06:31.200> them<00:06:31.410> on<00:06:31.590> to<00:06:32.010> the

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:32.130 
were and then glue them on to the

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:34.130 
were and then glue them on to the
divider<00:06:32.490> in<00:06:32.760> pieces<00:06:33.270> this<00:06:33.570> is<00:06:33.750> just<00:06:33.930> to<00:06:34.020> make

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:34.140 
divider in pieces this is just to make

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:36.650 
divider in pieces this is just to make
sure<00:06:34.380> that<00:06:34.680> nothing<00:06:35.010> tips<00:06:35.400> over<00:06:35.820> so<00:06:36.480> what<00:06:36.630> I

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:36.660 
sure that nothing tips over so what I

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:39.020 
sure that nothing tips over so what I
did<00:06:36.780> was<00:06:37.170> I<00:06:37.380> glued<00:06:37.740> one<00:06:38.040> side<00:06:38.310> on<00:06:38.550> and<00:06:38.760> I<00:06:38.820> just

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:39.030 
did was I glued one side on and I just

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:41.450 
did was I glued one side on and I just
held<00:06:39.330> it<00:06:39.510> there<00:06:39.750> for<00:06:39.810> about<00:06:40.080> five<00:06:40.920> to<00:06:41.250> ten

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:41.460 
held it there for about five to ten

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:43.950 
held it there for about five to ten
seconds

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:43.960 
seconds

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:47.379 
seconds
you

00:06:47.379 --> 00:06:47.389 

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:50.060 

then<00:06:48.389> for<00:06:48.690> the<00:06:48.780> other<00:06:48.810> side<00:06:49.290> I<00:06:49.530> put<00:06:49.740> the<00:06:49.860> glue

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:50.070 
then for the other side I put the glue

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:52.430 
then for the other side I put the glue
directly<00:06:50.250> where<00:06:50.760> I<00:06:50.790> marked<00:06:51.330> on<00:06:51.510> the<00:06:51.930> fabric

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:52.440 
directly where I marked on the fabric

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.320 
directly where I marked on the fabric
even<00:06:53.100> though<00:06:53.220> I'm<00:06:53.430> gluing<00:06:53.670> these<00:06:53.880> pieces

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:54.330 
even though I'm gluing these pieces

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.240 
even though I'm gluing these pieces
together<00:06:54.510> the<00:06:55.020> drawer<00:06:55.260> still<00:06:55.590> remains<00:06:55.919> fully

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:56.250
