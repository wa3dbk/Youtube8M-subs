00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
not gonna lie let's get into some

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.860 
not gonna lie let's get into some
gameplay<00:01:51.700> there's<00:01:51.910> some<00:01:52.030> changes<00:01:52.480> to<00:01:52.510> the<00:01:52.720> way

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:52.870 
gameplay there's some changes to the way

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.450 
gameplay there's some changes to the way
I<00:01:52.900> do<00:01:53.020> my<00:01:53.140> squad<00:01:53.440> builders<00:01:53.740> usually<00:01:54.220> it's

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
I do my squad builders usually it's

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.520 
I do my squad builders usually it's
three<00:01:55.150> games<00:01:55.390> against<00:01:55.840> an<00:01:55.930> opponent<00:01:56.200> you'll

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
three games against an opponent you'll

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:57.990 
three games against an opponent you'll
see<00:01:56.740> the<00:01:56.860> opponent's<00:01:57.250> team<00:01:57.400> and<00:01:57.670> then<00:01:57.760> we<00:01:57.850> show

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
see the opponent's team and then we show

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000 
see the opponent's team and then we show
highlights<00:01:58.360> of<00:01:58.510> both<00:01:59.050> his<00:01:59.290> side<00:01:59.530> and<00:01:59.770> my<00:01:59.980> side

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 
highlights of both his side and my side

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.260 
highlights of both his side and my side
and<00:02:00.400> now<00:02:00.460> he<00:02:00.550> gives<00:02:00.730> you<00:02:00.880> a<00:02:00.910> good<00:02:01.120> all-round

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
and now he gives you a good all-round

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.210 
and now he gives you a good all-round
view<00:02:01.630> of<00:02:01.750> it<00:02:01.900> but<00:02:02.320> I<00:02:02.350> thought<00:02:02.620> let's<00:02:02.830> change<00:02:03.100> it

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
view of it but I thought let's change it

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.950 
view of it but I thought let's change it
up<00:02:03.340> and<00:02:03.520> do<00:02:03.640> it<00:02:03.760> the<00:02:03.970> way<00:02:04.090> Bateson<00:02:04.600> kind<00:02:04.870> of

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
up and do it the way Bateson kind of

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.740 
up and do it the way Bateson kind of
does<00:02:05.110> it<00:02:05.290> cuz<00:02:05.890> um<00:02:06.220> it's<00:02:06.520> it's<00:02:06.820> good<00:02:07.510> because

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
does it cuz um it's it's good because

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.809 
does it cuz um it's it's good because
it's<00:02:08.440> good<00:02:08.679> to<00:02:08.800> mix<00:02:08.950> it<00:02:09.129> up<00:02:09.219> where<00:02:09.399> we<00:02:09.489> can<00:02:09.519> just

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
it's good to mix it up where we can just

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:13.410 
it's good to mix it up where we can just
show<00:02:10.090> goals<00:02:10.929> only<00:02:11.909> except<00:02:12.909> I've<00:02:13.120> added

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
show goals only except I've added

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.170 
show goals only except I've added

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
I said I wasn't going to do this for

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.810 
I said I wasn't going to do this for
squad<00:02:31.810> builders<00:02:32.140> but<00:02:32.320> I<00:02:32.530> think<00:02:33.070> with<00:02:33.370> the<00:02:33.490> xbox

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
squad builders but I think with the xbox

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.940 
squad builders but I think with the xbox
one<00:02:34.150> the<00:02:34.360> new<00:02:34.570> kind<00:02:34.900> of<00:02:35.080> dynamics<00:02:35.740> of<00:02:35.860> the

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
one the new kind of dynamics of the

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.010 
one the new kind of dynamics of the
camera<00:02:36.340> angles<00:02:36.610> I<00:02:36.760> think<00:02:37.240> it's<00:02:37.360> brilliant<00:02:37.570> and

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
camera angles I think it's brilliant and

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.350 
camera angles I think it's brilliant and
look<00:02:38.650> at<00:02:38.710> this<00:02:38.830> fig<00:02:39.040> for<00:02:39.250> example<00:02:39.670> it's<00:02:40.150> just

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
look at this fig for example it's just

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.180 
look at this fig for example it's just
continued<00:02:40.870> on<00:02:41.080> I<00:02:41.140> use<00:02:41.320> the<00:02:41.650> reap<00:02:41.830> it's<00:02:42.040> just

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
continued on I use the reap it's just

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:43.770 
continued on I use the reap it's just
brilliant<00:02:42.430> i<00:02:42.730> love<00:02:43.000> watching<00:02:43.240> it<00:02:43.540> like<00:02:43.660> that
