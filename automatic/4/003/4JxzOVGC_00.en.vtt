paintballing i got shot by the rapper
jamie<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.549> this<00:01:30.150> was<00:01:30.329> actually<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.840> map<00:01:31.110> that

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
jamie and this was actually the map that

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.910 
jamie and this was actually the map that
i<00:01:31.950> played<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:33.090> mike<00:01:33.780> swarmed<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:34.470> when<00:01:34.710> i<00:01:34.740> was

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
i played and mike swarmed it when i was

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.880 
i played and mike swarmed it when i was
on<00:01:35.040> his<00:01:35.220> team<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:35.729> I<00:01:36.689> I<00:01:36.960> just<00:01:37.439> didn't<00:01:37.590> like<00:01:37.710> it

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
on his team and I I just didn't like it

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.499 
on his team and I I just didn't like it
that<00:01:37.920> much<00:01:38.040> I<00:01:38.340> thought<00:01:38.549> was<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.700> bit<00:01:38.790> thing<00:01:39.030> and

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
that much I thought was a bit thing and

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.120 
that much I thought was a bit thing and
it<00:01:39.630> doesn't<00:01:40.110> play<00:01:40.290> though<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:40.650> depends<00:01:40.979> how

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
it doesn't play though it depends how

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.560 
it doesn't play though it depends how
your<00:01:41.280> team<00:01:41.460> play<00:01:41.640> on<00:01:41.909> how<00:01:42.060> i'm<00:01:42.210> at<00:01:42.329> plays<00:01:42.540> I

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
your team play on how i'm at plays I

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.819 
your team play on how i'm at plays I
think<00:01:42.899> it's<00:01:43.020> one<00:01:43.110> of<00:01:43.170> those<00:01:43.229> maps<00:01:43.470> that<00:01:43.649> it's

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
think it's one of those maps that it's

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.340 
think it's one of those maps that it's
very<00:01:44.070> up<00:01:44.490> and<00:01:44.939> down<00:01:45.090> even<00:01:45.689> like<00:01:45.810> I<00:01:45.840> played<00:01:46.200> it

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
very up and down even like I played it

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.749 
very up and down even like I played it
after<00:01:46.560> this<00:01:46.680> game<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.070> I<00:01:47.130> still<00:01:47.399> didn't<00:01:47.640> like

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
after this game and I still didn't like

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.520 
after this game and I still didn't like
it<00:01:47.909> as<00:01:48.030> much<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.540> is<00:01:48.720> actually<00:01:48.899> look<00:01:49.200> quite<00:01:49.409> a

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
it as much it is actually look quite a

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.130 
it as much it is actually look quite a
fast-paced<00:01:50.070> map<00:01:50.250> if<00:01:50.460> you<00:01:51.180> kind<00:01:51.420> of<00:01:51.630> hold<00:01:51.930> it

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
fast-paced map if you kind of hold it

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.109 
fast-paced map if you kind of hold it
off<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.500> don't<00:01:52.619> trip<00:01:52.890> triple<00:01:53.549> caps<00:01:53.729> it<00:01:53.909> is

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
off and don't trip triple caps it is

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.399 
off and don't trip triple caps it is
just<00:01:54.619> horrible<00:01:55.880> it<00:01:56.880> is<00:01:57.119> horrible<00:01:57.869> because

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
just horrible it is horrible because

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.810 
just horrible it is horrible because
there's<00:01:58.740> such<00:01:58.920> distance<00:01:59.340> so<00:01:59.490> many<00:01:59.670> different

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
there's such distance so many different

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.190 
there's such distance so many different
spawns<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.329> stuff<00:02:00.479> like<00:02:00.630> this<00:02:00.780> it's<00:02:01.079> just

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
spawns and stuff like this it's just

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.810 
spawns and stuff like this it's just
running<00:02:01.619> from<00:02:01.799> side<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.130> side<00:02:02.159> it's<00:02:02.460> not<00:02:02.640> it's

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
running from side to side it's not it's

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.300 
running from side to side it's not it's
not<00:02:02.939> it's<00:02:03.000> not<00:02:03.329> fun<00:02:03.659> in<00:02:04.590> my<00:02:04.770> opinion<00:02:04.890> how<00:02:05.100> it's

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.229 
underground bit it plays very similarly
you've<00:02:56.250> got<00:02:56.370> that<00:02:56.459> long<00:02:56.670> building<00:02:57.030> on<00:02:57.150> the

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
you've got that long building on the

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.300 
you've got that long building on the
side<00:02:57.450> where<00:02:58.170> you<00:02:58.260> couldn't<00:02:58.470> overlook<00:02:58.829> into

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
side where you couldn't overlook into

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.770 
side where you couldn't overlook into
the<00:02:59.400> middle<00:02:59.670> section<00:03:00.150> and<00:03:00.389> then<00:03:00.540> you've<00:03:00.689> got

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
the middle section and then you've got

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.619 
the middle section and then you've got
that<00:03:00.900> kind<00:03:01.200> of<00:03:01.260> big<00:03:01.560> building<00:03:02.040> on<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:02.939> left

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629 
that kind of big building on the left

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:05.149 
that kind of big building on the left
and<00:03:03.840> up<00:03:03.959> with<00:03:04.139> a<00:03:04.170> paintball<00:03:04.530> arena<00:03:04.620> and<00:03:04.889> sup<00:03:05.069> it

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:05.159 
and up with a paintball arena and sup it

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:06.770 
and up with a paintball arena and sup it
plays<00:03:05.370> very<00:03:05.579> very<00:03:05.849> similar<00:03:06.120> to<00:03:06.269> radiation

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
plays very very similar to radiation

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:07.940 
plays very very similar to radiation
which<00:03:06.900> I'm<00:03:07.109> very<00:03:07.139> like<00:03:07.409> so<00:03:07.590> I<00:03:07.620> was<00:03:07.709> a<00:03:07.739> really

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
which I'm very like so I was a really

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.440

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
play it in black ops 1 some reason why

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:13.429 
play it in black ops 1 some reason why
this<00:03:11.220> was<00:03:11.549> scratched<00:03:11.909> in<00:03:12.150> such<00:03:12.420> a<00:03:12.450> way<00:03:12.750> that<00:03:13.019> if
