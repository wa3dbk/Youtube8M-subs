then<00:01:17.990> in<00:01:18.200> the<00:01:18.610> 1950s<00:01:19.610> some<00:01:20.270> tricky<00:01:20.840> chemists

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
then in the 1950s some tricky chemists

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:24.580 
then in the 1950s some tricky chemists
found<00:01:21.800> that<00:01:22.580> they<00:01:23.060> could<00:01:23.330> link<00:01:23.690> this<00:01:24.110> chemical

found that they could link this chemical

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.300 
found that they could link this chemical
together<00:01:25.310> and<00:01:25.700> it<00:01:26.270> creates<00:01:26.870> a<00:01:27.230> hard<00:01:27.710> clear

together and it creates a hard clear

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.600 
together and it creates a hard clear
glass<00:01:28.970> like<00:01:29.420> plastic<00:01:30.380> and<00:01:30.560> this<00:01:30.800> glass<00:01:31.250> like

everyday<00:01:35.180> the<00:01:35.810> only<00:01:36.070> problem<00:01:37.070> with<00:01:37.310> that<00:01:37.370> is

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
everyday the only problem with that is

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.990 
everyday the only problem with that is
