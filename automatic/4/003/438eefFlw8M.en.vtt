more<00:02:12.519> aggressive<00:02:13.060> during<00:02:14.019> the<00:02:14.260> year<00:02:14.560> and

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
more aggressive during the year and

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:19.470 
more aggressive during the year and
maybe<00:02:16.299> fealty<00:02:16.810> leaders<00:02:17.140> do<00:02:17.409> that<00:02:18.030> they<00:02:19.030> look<00:02:19.390> a

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
maybe fealty leaders do that they look a

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.479 
maybe fealty leaders do that they look a
little<00:02:19.599> bit<00:02:19.810> that<00:02:19.959> way<00:02:20.140> and<00:02:20.319> then<00:02:20.439> be<00:02:20.650> be<00:02:21.280> nice

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
little bit that way and then be be nice

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.429 
little bit that way and then be be nice
to<00:02:21.670> see<00:02:21.849> em<00:02:21.939> just<00:02:22.120> get<00:02:22.329> back<00:02:22.510> to<00:02:22.659> that<00:02:22.689> that

really<00:02:23.799> that<00:02:24.459> really<00:02:24.819> constructive

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
really that really constructive

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.720 
really that really constructive
technical<00:02:26.140> discipline<00:02:26.620> that<00:02:26.739> we<00:02:26.890> saw<00:02:27.129> not

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
technical discipline that we saw not

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.009 
technical discipline that we saw not
just<00:02:27.939> in<00:02:28.030> Spain<00:02:28.299> what's<00:02:28.599> happening<00:02:28.900> before

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
just in Spain what's happening before

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.129 
just in Spain what's happening before
then<00:02:29.379> as<00:02:29.500> well<00:02:29.650> in<00:02:30.069> places<00:02:30.549> and<00:02:31.019> but<00:02:32.019> of<00:02:32.109> course

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:32.139 
then as well in places and but of course

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:34.470 
then as well in places and but of course
it's<00:02:33.069> the<00:02:33.280> most<00:02:33.459> obvious<00:02:33.639> and<00:02:34.030> Spain<00:02:34.239> where<00:02:34.420> he

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
it's the most obvious and Spain where he

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.030 
it's the most obvious and Spain where he
won<00:02:34.629> the<00:02:34.750> right<00:02:34.870> you<00:02:35.500> could<00:02:35.650> see<00:02:35.859> him<00:02:36.010> getting

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
won the right you could see him getting

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.209 
won the right you could see him getting
his<00:02:36.400> diagonals<00:02:36.969> and<00:02:37.090> give<00:02:37.269> the<00:02:37.389> car<00:02:37.540> flat<00:02:37.840> and

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:38.219 
his diagonals and give the car flat and

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:41.699 
his diagonals and give the car flat and
prolifically<00:02:39.219> disciplined<00:02:39.760> stuff<00:02:40.510> and<00:02:40.810> you

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
prolifically disciplined stuff and you

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.069 
prolifically disciplined stuff and you
wonder<00:02:42.069> if<00:02:42.129> then<00:02:43.030> you<00:02:43.450> know<00:02:43.599> he<00:02:43.780> was<00:02:43.900> just

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079 
wonder if then you know he was just

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:45.899 
wonder if then you know he was just
looking<00:02:44.290> for<00:02:44.409> that<00:02:44.500> next<00:02:44.530> win<00:02:45.010> and<00:02:45.310> was<00:02:45.760> just

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:45.909 
looking for that next win and was just

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:48.119 
looking for that next win and was just
trying<00:02:46.150> harder<00:02:46.510> and<00:02:46.629> harder<00:02:46.780> maybe<00:02:47.260> maybe

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:48.129 
trying harder and harder maybe maybe

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:50.789 
trying harder and harder maybe maybe
that<00:02:48.549> will<00:02:48.639> come<00:02:49.209> back<00:02:49.389> to<00:02:49.510> him<00:02:49.659> again<00:02:49.900> I<00:02:50.439> you

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
that will come back to him again I you

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:53.819 
that will come back to him again I you
hope<00:02:51.189> so<00:02:51.430> but<00:02:52.060> at<00:02:52.269> the<00:02:52.389> moment<00:02:52.599> he's<00:02:53.500> going<00:02:53.739> to

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829 
hope so but at the moment he's going to

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:56.490 
hope so but at the moment he's going to
find<00:02:54.010> grows<00:02:54.220> on<00:02:54.430> a<00:02:54.609> very<00:02:55.180> tough<00:02:55.900> customer

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
find grows on a very tough customer

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.250 
find grows on a very tough customer
three<00:02:56.889> and<00:02:57.609> how<00:02:57.790> do<00:02:57.849> you<00:02:58.000> think<00:02:58.329> Raymond<00:02:59.049> will

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
three and how do you think Raymond will

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.839 
three and how do you think Raymond will
react<00:02:59.620> to<00:03:00.250> this<00:03:00.510> Latino<00:03:02.099> Queen<00:03:03.099> racing<00:03:03.609> driver

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:03.849 
react to this Latino Queen racing driver

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:08.729 
react to this Latino Queen racing driver
who<00:03:04.180> doesn't<00:03:04.480> say<00:03:04.629> very<00:03:04.780> much<00:03:05.790> yeah<00:03:06.810> I<00:03:07.810> think

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
who doesn't say very much yeah I think

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:10.709 
who doesn't say very much yeah I think
he's<00:03:08.889> going<00:03:09.099> to<00:03:09.189> find<00:03:09.519> a<00:03:09.849> little<00:03:10.329> bit<00:03:10.510> like

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:10.719 
he's going to find a little bit like

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:13.379 
he's going to find a little bit like
Mike<00:03:11.109> pastors<00:03:11.799> going<00:03:11.980> to<00:03:12.069> find<00:03:12.310> and<00:03:12.939> grows<00:03:13.180> on

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:13.389 
Mike pastors going to find and grows on

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:15.559 
Mike pastors going to find and grows on
that<00:03:13.569> tough<00:03:13.750> customer<00:03:14.260> and<00:03:14.439> I<00:03:14.980> think<00:03:15.040> that

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
that tough customer and I think that

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:18.869 
that tough customer and I think that
goes<00:03:16.569> on<00:03:16.750> is<00:03:16.870> going<00:03:17.049> to<00:03:17.260> find<00:03:17.530> pass<00:03:18.220> some<00:03:18.489> very

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:18.879 
goes on is going to find pass some very

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:21.509 
goes on is going to find pass some very
very<00:03:19.090> opportunist<00:03:19.690> driver<00:03:19.900> who<00:03:20.229> is<00:03:20.769> not<00:03:21.310> going

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
very opportunist driver who is not going

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:24.890 
very opportunist driver who is not going
to<00:03:21.639> let<00:03:22.389> any<00:03:22.629> gaps<00:03:23.049> go<00:03:23.409> unfilled<00:03:23.949> you<00:03:24.579> know

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
to let any gaps go unfilled you know

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.469 
to let any gaps go unfilled you know
during<00:03:25.900> the<00:03:26.109> race<00:03:26.290> and<00:03:26.560> and<00:03:27.090> is<00:03:28.090> kind<00:03:28.269> of<00:03:28.389> being

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:28.479 
during the race and and is kind of being

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:31.199 
during the race and and is kind of being
very<00:03:28.569> hard<00:03:29.169> charging<00:03:29.739> really<00:03:30.699> hard<00:03:30.849> charging

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
very hard charging really hard charging

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.780 
very hard charging really hard charging
fees<00:03:31.629> and<00:03:31.840> I<00:03:31.930> think<00:03:32.199> the<00:03:32.680> Roman<00:03:33.099> will<00:03:33.250> find<00:03:33.519> him

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
fees and I think the Roman will find him

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:39.119 
fees and I think the Roman will find him
in<00:03:34.090> a<00:03:34.810> way<00:03:35.169> a<00:03:36.900> little<00:03:37.900> bit<00:03:38.019> more<00:03:38.560> puffing<00:03:39.040> away

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:39.129 
in a way a little bit more puffing away

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:41.610 
in a way a little bit more puffing away
than<00:03:39.400> kill<00:03:39.579> you<00:03:39.669> can<00:03:39.819> we<00:03:40.019> outperformed<00:03:41.019> goes

than kill you can we outperformed goes

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.199 
than kill you can we outperformed goes
on<00:03:41.799> through<00:03:41.919> most<00:03:42.129> of<00:03:42.220> the<00:03:42.280> ec50<00:03:42.729> up<00:03:42.970> went

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
on through most of the ec50 up went

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:45.659 
on through most of the ec50 up went
ahead<00:03:43.359> despite<00:03:44.290> you<00:03:44.859> know<00:03:44.949> I'm<00:03:45.040> not<00:03:45.370> doing<00:03:45.609> the

ahead despite you know I'm not doing the

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:48.929 
ahead despite you know I'm not doing the
last<00:03:45.849> two<00:03:46.060> races<00:03:46.209> so<00:03:47.019> no<00:03:47.590> question<00:03:48.040> he<00:03:48.400> was<00:03:48.609> he

00:03:48.929 --> 00:03:48.939 
last two races so no question he was he

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:51.390 
last two races so no question he was he
was<00:03:49.120> the<00:03:49.329> senior<00:03:49.840> driver<00:03:50.079> there<00:03:50.409> but<00:03:51.069> now<00:03:51.340> the

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
was the senior driver there but now the

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.069 
was the senior driver there but now the
expectation<00:03:52.209> as<00:03:52.299> it<00:03:52.419> grows<00:03:52.569> all<00:03:52.780> be<00:03:52.959> the

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:53.079 
expectation as it grows all be the

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:57.059 
expectation as it grows all be the
leader<00:03:53.319> and<00:03:54.569> pastors<00:03:55.799> expectation<00:03:56.799> will<00:03:56.949> be

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:30.110 
McLaren longer because if you had been

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:31.990

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:33.979 
Alan Price there to have to be and you

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:35.080

teammate which to me I don't know what

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:38.860 
teammate which to me I don't know what
you<00:04:37.669> think<00:04:37.939> about<00:04:38.000> this<00:04:38.240> that<00:04:38.449> was<00:04:38.599> kind<00:04:38.810> of

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
you think about this that was kind of

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:40.029 
you think about this that was kind of
rewriting<00:04:39.229> history<00:04:39.469> a<00:04:39.650> little<00:04:39.830> bit<00:04:39.949> because

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:40.039 
rewriting history a little bit because

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:42.879 
rewriting history a little bit because
John<00:04:40.370> Watson<00:04:40.759> was<00:04:40.909> never<00:04:41.210> slow<00:04:41.599> on<00:04:42.500> Sunday

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:42.889 
John Watson was never slow on Sunday

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:44.230 
John Watson was never slow on Sunday
night<00:04:43.069> he<00:04:43.310> wasn't<00:04:43.460> given<00:04:43.729> much<00:04:43.759> credit<00:04:44.210> for

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
night he wasn't given much credit for

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.779 
night he wasn't given much credit for
being<00:04:44.509> as<00:04:45.020> fast<00:04:45.530> as<00:04:45.770> he<00:04:45.919> was<00:04:46.099> and<00:04:46.340> often<00:04:46.639> this

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:46.789 
being as fast as he was and often this

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:51.209 
being as fast as he was and often this
this<00:04:47.719> mistake<00:04:48.319> appears<00:04:49.129> in<00:04:49.960> history<00:04:50.960> I<00:04:50.990> think

00:04:51.209 --> 00:04:51.219 
this mistake appears in history I think

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:54.189 
this mistake appears in history I think
does<00:04:52.219> that<00:04:52.490> to<00:04:52.879> some<00:04:53.120> racing<00:04:53.539> drivers<00:04:53.990> and

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:54.199 
does that to some racing drivers and

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:56.619 
does that to some racing drivers and
John<00:04:54.349> Watson<00:04:54.680> is<00:04:54.800> now<00:04:54.919> pigeon-holed<00:04:55.669> as<00:04:55.909> a<00:04:56.120> guy

00:04:56.619 --> 00:04:56.629 
John Watson is now pigeon-holed as a guy

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:59.080 
John Watson is now pigeon-holed as a guy
that<00:04:56.840> wasn't<00:04:57.020> particularly<00:04:57.500> fast<00:04:57.919> but<00:04:58.370> my

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
that wasn't particularly fast but my

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.820 
that wasn't particularly fast but my
memory<00:04:59.360> is<00:04:59.659> a<00:04:59.690> little<00:04:59.840> bit<00:05:00.139> what<00:05:00.469> yours<00:05:00.680> is

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830

John<00:05:01.580> Watson<00:05:01.879> was<00:05:01.969> a<00:05:02.000> very<00:05:02.479> very<00:05:02.900> fast<00:05:03.229> racing

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
John Watson was a very very fast racing

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.350 
John Watson was a very very fast racing
driver<00:05:03.830> frequently<00:05:04.550> beat<00:05:04.699> Niki<00:05:05.000> Lauda<00:05:05.150> and

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 
driver frequently beat Niki Lauda and

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.029 
driver frequently beat Niki Lauda and
often<00:05:05.750> passed<00:05:05.990> him<00:05:06.259> in<00:05:06.349> places<00:05:06.650> where<00:05:06.770> Nikki

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:07.039 
often passed him in places where Nikki

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:08.260 
often passed him in places where Nikki
thought<00:05:07.280> he<00:05:07.370> was<00:05:07.520> never<00:05:07.610> going<00:05:07.849> to<00:05:07.909> be<00:05:07.969> passed

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
thought he was never going to be passed

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.040 
thought he was never going to be passed
I<00:05:08.590> I<00:05:10.060> agree<00:05:11.060> one<00:05:11.210> hundred<00:05:11.300> percent<00:05:11.539> i<00:05:11.930> was

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
I I agree one hundred percent i was

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.559 
I I agree one hundred percent i was
putting<00:05:12.319> niki<00:05:12.620> lauda<00:05:12.770> attempt<00:05:13.520> at<00:05:13.639> humor

00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:14.569 
putting niki lauda attempt at humor

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:16.540 
putting niki lauda attempt at humor
which<00:05:14.780> I<00:05:15.020> think<00:05:15.529> silesia<00:05:16.009> littell<00:05:16.310> does<00:05:16.520> a

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
which I think silesia littell does a

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.050 
which I think silesia littell does a
little<00:05:16.819> bit<00:05:16.969> better<00:05:17.150> and<00:05:18.520> not<00:05:19.520> completely<00:05:20.000> a

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
little bit better and not completely a

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.330 
little bit better and not completely a
very<00:05:20.479> very<00:05:20.750> smallest<00:05:21.110> fast<00:05:21.500> driver<00:05:21.830> and

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:22.340 
very very smallest fast driver and

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.580 
very very smallest fast driver and
because<00:05:22.669> he<00:05:22.819> has<00:05:23.270> an<00:05:23.590> accommodating

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:24.590 
because he has an accommodating

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:27.760 
because he has an accommodating
personality<00:05:25.340> as<00:05:25.639> quite<00:05:26.090> modest<00:05:26.509> John<00:05:26.770> Watson

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 
personality as quite modest John Watson

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.209 
personality as quite modest John Watson
when<00:05:28.069> you<00:05:28.190> hear<00:05:28.400> him<00:05:28.520> talking<00:05:28.969> and<00:05:29.150> and<00:05:29.810> I<00:05:30.740> just

00:05:31.209 --> 00:05:31.219 
when you hear him talking and and I just

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:32.920 
when you hear him talking and and I just
think<00:05:31.430> that's<00:05:31.610> a<00:05:31.699> personality<00:05:32.419> thing<00:05:32.569> but<00:05:32.750> yes

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:32.930 
think that's a personality thing but yes

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.110 
think that's a personality thing but yes
what<00:05:33.620> some<00:05:33.919> he<00:05:34.279> was<00:05:34.430> in<00:05:34.520> contention<00:05:34.789> for<00:05:35.000> the

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 
what some he was in contention for the

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.909 
what some he was in contention for the
World<00:05:35.330> Championship<00:05:35.419> was<00:05:35.930> the<00:05:36.110> end<00:05:36.259> of<00:05:36.349> 1983

World Championship was the end of 1983

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:39.550 
World Championship was the end of 1983

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
Watson and niki lauda next I think

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:54.850 
Watson and niki lauda next I think
louder<00:05:49.819> is<00:05:50.120> imposing<00:05:51.219> his<00:05:52.219> his<00:05:52.940> view<00:05:53.509> of<00:05:53.860> frost

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860 
louder is imposing his his view of frost

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:01.379 
louder is imposing his his view of frost
who<00:05:55.550> really<00:05:56.050> did<00:05:57.580> ruin<00:05:58.580> loudest<00:05:59.770> 1985<00:06:00.770> season

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:01.389 
who really did ruin loudest 1985 season

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:04.510 
who really did ruin loudest 1985 season
and<00:06:02.389> I<00:06:02.960> think<00:06:03.289> he's<00:06:03.440> sort<00:06:03.770> of<00:06:03.830> reverse

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:04.520 
and I think he's sort of reverse

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.369 
and I think he's sort of reverse
engineering<00:06:04.729> that<00:06:05.300> back<00:06:05.599> in<00:06:05.779> or<00:06:05.900> women<00:06:06.229> that

00:06:06.369 --> 00:06:06.379 
engineering that back in or women that

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:08.860 
engineering that back in or women that
ever<00:06:06.529> been<00:06:06.710> with<00:06:06.889> John<00:06:07.069> well<00:06:07.310> no<00:06:07.789> I<00:06:07.819> think<00:06:08.389> John

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:08.870 
ever been with John well no I think John

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.260 
ever been with John well no I think John
Watson<00:06:09.370> disappeared<00:06:10.370> job<00:06:10.580> we<00:06:10.699> know<00:06:10.849> we<00:06:11.089> just

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:11.270 
Watson disappeared job we know we just
