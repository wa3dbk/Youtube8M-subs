kind of loud but otherwise let's get to

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.360 
kind of loud but otherwise let's get to
the<00:00:37.200> first<00:00:37.350> attack<00:00:39.770> alright<00:00:40.770> with<00:00:40.920> any<00:00:41.070> attack

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
the first attack alright with any attack

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.740 
the first attack alright with any attack
first<00:00:41.640> thing<00:00:41.790> we<00:00:41.850> want<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.000> figure<00:00:42.149> out<00:00:42.329> is<00:00:42.480> are

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
first thing we want to figure out is are

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.270 
first thing we want to figure out is are
we<00:00:42.840> even<00:00:42.989> doing<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.260> right<00:00:43.410> style<00:00:43.739> so<00:00:44.129> let's

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
we even doing the right style so let's

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.250 
we even doing the right style so let's
run<00:00:44.460> through<00:00:44.610> them<00:00:44.820> 105-degree<00:00:45.539> obviously<00:00:46.140> we

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
run through them 105-degree obviously we

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.290 
run through them 105-degree obviously we
think<00:00:46.440> it's<00:00:46.559> right<00:00:46.739> but<00:00:46.890> notice<00:00:47.309> all<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.149> ad

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
think it's right but notice all the ad

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.150 
think it's right but notice all the ad
is<00:00:48.480> within<00:00:48.719> five<00:00:49.079> tiles<00:00:49.350> of<00:00:49.590> each<00:00:49.710> other<00:00:49.980> and

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
is within five tiles of each other and

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.529 
is within five tiles of each other and
the<00:00:50.340> pre<00:00:50.550> padding<00:00:50.969> is<00:00:51.030> kind<00:00:51.180> of<00:00:51.239> built<00:00:51.390> there

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
the pre padding is kind of built there

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.119 
the pre padding is kind of built there
see<00:00:51.660> how<00:00:51.719> that<00:00:51.840> finger<00:00:52.170> points<00:00:52.530> out<00:00:52.649> up<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.890> 4

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
see how that finger points out up to 4

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.520 
see how that finger points out up to 4
30<00:00:53.399> on<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.699> map<00:00:53.879> it'll<00:00:54.690> be<00:00:54.780> nice<00:00:54.960> pretty<00:00:55.320> easy

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
30 on the map it'll be nice pretty easy

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.170 
30 on the map it'll be nice pretty easy
way<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.739> cut<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.160> then<00:00:56.250> how<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.399> drag<00:00:56.730> funnel

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
way to cut and then how to drag funnel

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.700 
way to cut and then how to drag funnel
into<00:00:57.360> that<00:00:57.480> first<00:00:57.719> position<00:00:58.109> on<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.350> inverted

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
into that first position on the inverted

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.760 
into that first position on the inverted
the<00:00:59.399> hog<00:00:59.579> pathing<00:01:00.300> left<00:01:00.750> probably<00:01:01.559> there<00:01:01.739> I

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
the hog pathing left probably there I

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.349 
the hog pathing left probably there I
don't<00:01:01.920> see<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.190> tube<00:01:02.430> by<00:01:02.550> force<00:01:02.879> that<00:01:03.120> might

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
don't see a tube by force that might

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.420 
don't see a tube by force that might
work<00:01:03.570> or<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:03.899> go<00:01:04.110> wipe<00:01:04.290> same<00:01:04.619> deal<00:01:04.860> walls<00:01:05.220> are

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.520 
work or a go wipe same deal walls are
pretty<00:01:05.549> weak<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.270> looks<00:01:06.869> like<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.140> test<00:01:07.380> is

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
pretty weak and looks like the test is

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.200 
pretty weak and looks like the test is
only<00:01:07.619> two<00:01:07.860> by<00:01:07.979> two<00:01:08.040> spots<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.640> see<00:01:08.850> or<00:01:09.030> right

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
only two by two spots I see or right

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.210 
only two by two spots I see or right
there<00:01:09.420> towards<00:01:09.840> MIT<00:01:10.020> or<00:01:10.140> neighboring<00:01:10.799> it<00:01:11.040> so

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
there towards MIT or neighboring it so

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.679 
there towards MIT or neighboring it so
to<00:01:11.310> get<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.610> mid<00:01:11.790> you<00:01:11.939> kind<00:01:12.180> of<00:01:12.210> try<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.479> take

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
to get the mid you kind of try to take

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.750 
to get the mid you kind of try to take
them<00:01:12.810> out<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:12.930> mountains<00:01:13.380> your<00:01:13.470> peckers<00:01:13.860> the

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.160 
looks good could have done a couple
other<00:01:32.850> one<00:01:33.030> but<00:01:33.390> let's<00:01:33.689> move<00:01:33.840> on<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.110> next

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
other one but let's move on to the next

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.499 
other one but let's move on to the next
step<00:01:34.380> I'll<00:01:34.530> give<00:01:34.650> you<00:01:34.740> green<00:01:35.270> the<00:01:36.270> next

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
step I'll give you green the next

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.210 
step I'll give you green the next
decision<00:01:36.720> is<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.200> attack<00:01:37.470> line<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.009> in<00:01:38.100> this

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
decision is the attack line and in this

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.130 
decision is the attack line and in this
case<00:01:38.490> we're<00:01:39.150> actually<00:01:39.360> going<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.689> see<00:01:39.900> what

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
case we're actually going to see what

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.840 
case we're actually going to see what
makes<00:01:40.350> this<00:01:40.470> attack<00:01:40.890> unique<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.460> that's<00:01:41.610> such

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
makes this attack unique and that's such

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.850 
makes this attack unique and that's such
an<00:01:42.000> inverted<00:01:42.479> attack<00:01:42.810> we're<00:01:43.560> not<00:01:43.649> actually

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
an inverted attack we're not actually

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.039 
an inverted attack we're not actually
going<00:01:44.009> first<00:01:44.520> for<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.790> two<00:01:44.970> ladies<00:01:45.240> coming

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
going first for the two ladies coming

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.990 
going first for the two ladies coming
from<00:01:46.229> 1030<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:46.979> try<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.220> broadside<00:01:47.700> them<00:01:47.880> as<00:01:47.970> a

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
from 1030 to try to broadside them as a

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.240 
from 1030 to try to broadside them as a
first<00:01:48.299> step<00:01:48.420> rather<00:01:49.290> we'll<00:01:49.530> take<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.950> point

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
first step rather we'll take the point

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.219 
first step rather we'll take the point
of<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.430> be<00:01:50.579> coming<00:01:51.000> from<00:01:51.090> 430<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.750> start

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
of the be coming from 430 to start

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.450 
of the be coming from 430 to start
because<00:01:52.560> it's<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:52.680> little<00:01:52.860> closer<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.340> edge

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
because it's a little closer to the edge

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.780 
because it's a little closer to the edge
and<00:01:53.790> then<00:01:54.659> hit<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.140> two<00:01:55.649> broadsides<00:01:56.100> at<00:01:56.700> the

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
and then hit the two broadsides at the

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.910 
and then hit the two broadsides at the
tail<00:01:57.030> end<00:01:57.090> of<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.420> attack<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:58.079> as<00:01:58.469> long<00:01:58.649> as

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
tail end of the attack and as long as

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.010 
tail end of the attack and as long as
you<00:01:59.009> have<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.159> heel<00:01:59.549> and<00:01:59.700> a<00:01:59.729> rage<00:01:59.939> left<00:02:00.479> for<00:02:00.899> that

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
you have a heel and a rage left for that

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.620 
you have a heel and a rage left for that
final<00:02:01.290> broadside<00:02:01.979> you<00:02:02.640> can<00:02:02.820> do<00:02:02.939> this<00:02:03.060> inverted

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
final broadside you can do this inverted

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.319 
final broadside you can do this inverted
give<00:02:04.350> it<00:02:04.469> a<00:02:04.530> name<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:05.520> next<00:02:05.759> point<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.119> cuts

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
give it a name the next point the cuts

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.419 
give it a name the next point the cuts
is<00:02:06.570> we've<00:02:06.780> discussed<00:02:07.229> earlier<00:02:07.649> is<00:02:07.740> right<00:02:08.280> from

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
is we've discussed earlier is right from

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.370 
is we've discussed earlier is right from
three<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.119> six<00:02:09.360> o'clock<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:09.869> he<00:02:09.959> does<00:02:10.140> that

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
three and six o'clock and he does that

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.500 
three and six o'clock and he does that
so<00:02:10.590> I<00:02:10.619> got<00:02:10.979> an<00:02:11.099> a<00:02:11.190> on<00:02:11.220> that<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:12.239> we<00:02:12.300> want<00:02:12.450> to

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
so I got an a on that and we want to

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.759 
so I got an a on that and we want to
deploy<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.870> main<00:02:13.019> force<00:02:13.319> right<00:02:13.590> on<00:02:13.680> the

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:13.769 
deploy the main force right on the

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:15.050 
deploy the main force right on the
attack<00:02:14.010> line<00:02:14.220> it<00:02:14.370> does<00:02:14.489> that<00:02:14.700> pretty<00:02:14.910> well

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
attack line it does that pretty well

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.820 
attack line it does that pretty well
then<00:02:15.330> see<00:02:15.569> Siemens<00:02:16.019> right<00:02:16.200> before<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.590> spell

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
then see Siemens right before the spell

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.500 
then see Siemens right before the spell
to<00:02:16.860> help<00:02:17.069> take<00:02:17.340> out<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:17.670> clan<00:02:17.880> castle<00:02:17.910> I'll<00:02:18.390> be

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
to help take out the clan castle I'll be

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:19.640 
to help take out the clan castle I'll be
the<00:02:18.630> Rays<00:02:18.810> and<00:02:19.019> then<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.200> Healey<00:02:19.470> is<00:02:19.530> he

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
the Rays and then the Healey is he

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.589 
the Rays and then the Healey is he
dropping<00:02:19.890> there<00:02:20.280> and<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.150> heels<00:02:21.360> actually

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
dropping there and the heels actually

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.210 
dropping there and the heels actually
nailing<00:02:22.050> the<00:02:22.140> final<00:02:22.470> push<00:02:22.620> into<00:02:22.950> the

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
nailing the final push into the

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.890 
nailing the final push into the
broadsides<00:02:23.910> we<00:02:24.060> talked<00:02:24.269> about<00:02:24.390> flipping

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
broadsides we talked about flipping

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.650 
broadsides we talked about flipping
around<00:02:25.130> standard<00:02:26.130> 105<00:02:26.550> to<00:02:26.880> be<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:27.180> inverted

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
around standard 105 to be the inverted

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.479 
around standard 105 to be the inverted
but<00:02:27.989> as<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.290> attack<00:02:28.560> benches<00:02:28.950> out<00:02:29.099> let's<00:02:29.310> go

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
but as the attack benches out let's go

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.850 
but as the attack benches out let's go
over<00:02:29.580> the<00:02:29.670> inverted<00:02:29.970> one<00:02:30.120> last<00:02:30.330> time<00:02:30.599> so<00:02:31.319> 105

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
over the inverted one last time so 105

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.550 
over the inverted one last time so 105
but<00:02:32.250> you're<00:02:32.370> attacking<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:32.880> point<00:02:33.150> of<00:02:33.209> the<00:02:33.330> V

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
but you're attacking the point of the V

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.990 
but you're attacking the point of the V
instead<00:02:34.560> of<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:34.739> broadside<00:02:35.280> of<00:02:35.310> start<00:02:35.730> and

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
instead of the broadside of start and

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.300 
instead of the broadside of start and
what<00:02:36.209> that<00:02:36.540> does<00:02:36.750> is<00:02:36.810> spells<00:02:37.410> a<00:02:37.620> change<00:02:37.950> to<00:02:38.190> be

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
what that does is spells a change to be

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.220 
what that does is spells a change to be
to<00:02:38.519> rage<00:02:38.790> one<00:02:39.090> hill<00:02:39.299> because<00:02:39.420> you<00:02:39.540> can<00:02:39.690> rage<00:02:39.900> to

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
to rage one hill because you can rage to

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.020 
to rage one hill because you can rage to
first<00:02:40.500> get<00:02:40.650> to<00:02:40.769> the<00:02:40.860> point<00:02:40.980> of<00:02:41.099> the<00:02:41.190> V<00:02:41.310> then

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
first get to the point of the V then

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.120 
first get to the point of the V then
he'll<00:02:42.480> as<00:02:42.690> you<00:02:42.989> broadside<00:02:43.230> and<00:02:43.650> ray<00:02:43.830> just

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
he'll as you broadside and ray just

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.940 
he'll as you broadside and ray just
before<00:02:44.840> otherwise<00:02:45.840> it's<00:02:46.110> all<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:46.410> same<00:02:46.620> and
