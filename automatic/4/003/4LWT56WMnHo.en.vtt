both<00:01:31.340> sunroofs<00:01:35.649> think<00:01:36.649> the<00:01:36.979> only<00:01:37.250> thing<00:01:37.460> which

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
both sunroofs think the only thing which

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.350 
both sunroofs think the only thing which
isn't<00:01:38.270> working<00:01:38.810> is<00:01:39.049> that<00:01:39.950> ball<00:01:40.250> there<00:01:40.670> which

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
isn't working is that ball there which

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.419 
isn't working is that ball there which
basically<00:01:41.689> tells<00:01:42.170> you<00:01:42.439> how<00:01:42.619> far<00:01:42.890> the<00:01:42.950> cars

00:01:43.419 --> 00:01:43.429 
basically tells you how far the cars

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:46.179 
basically tells you how far the cars
leaning<00:01:43.909> over<00:01:44.030> and<00:01:44.420> that's<00:01:45.409> the<00:01:45.740> only<00:01:46.009> thing

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
leaning over and that's the only thing

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:47.980 
leaning over and that's the only thing
will<00:01:46.340> act<00:01:46.520> upon<00:01:46.850> which<00:01:47.060> doesn't<00:01:47.420> work<00:01:47.630> to<00:01:47.869> be

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
will act upon which doesn't work to be

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:54.010 
will act upon which doesn't work to be
honest<00:01:49.210> the<00:01:50.210> rest<00:01:50.360> of<00:01:50.509> it<00:01:50.630> he's<00:01:51.110> fine<00:01:53.020> should

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
honest the rest of it he's fine should

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.639
