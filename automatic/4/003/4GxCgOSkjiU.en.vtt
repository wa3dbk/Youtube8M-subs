number<00:00:40.379> 10<00:00:40.590> give<00:00:41.010> bites<00:00:41.780> obviously<00:00:42.780> you're

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
number 10 give bites obviously you're

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.510 
number 10 give bites obviously you're
going<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:43.050> want<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.290> use<00:00:43.440> this<00:00:43.590> in<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.800> Nu<00:00:44.280> tier

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
going to want to use this in the Nu tier

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.029 
going to want to use this in the Nu tier
or<00:00:44.809> I<00:00:45.809> mean<00:00:46.020> I<00:00:46.140> guess<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.440> could<00:00:46.469> use<00:00:46.829> a

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
or I mean I guess you could use a

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.660 
or I mean I guess you could use a
Garchomp<00:00:47.489> variance<00:00:48.360> in<00:00:48.629> oh<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:49.590> or<00:00:50.160> maybe

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
Garchomp variance in oh you or maybe

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.540 
Garchomp variance in oh you or maybe
even<00:00:50.760> in<00:00:51.270> 5th<00:00:51.629> gen<00:00:51.840> I<00:00:51.870> don't<00:00:52.140> know<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.440> have<00:00:53.430> not

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
even in 5th gen I don't know I have not

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.410 
even in 5th gen I don't know I have not
tried<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.390> but<00:00:55.260> an<00:00:55.379> nu<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:55.770> works<00:00:55.949> pretty<00:00:56.129> well

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
tried it but an nu it works pretty well

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.459 
tried it but an nu it works pretty well
basically<00:00:57.420> in<00:00:57.690> order<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:57.989> use<00:00:58.140> this<00:00:58.289> that

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
basically in order to use this that

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.810 
basically in order to use this that
effectively<00:00:58.890> you're<00:00:59.219> going<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.430> need<00:00:59.579> two

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
effectively you're going to need two

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.729 
effectively you're going to need two
things<00:01:00.079> one<00:01:01.079> is<00:01:02.090> sand<00:01:03.090> up<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.780> make<00:01:03.960> use<00:01:04.199> of<00:01:04.229> his

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
things one is sand up to make use of his

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.710 
things one is sand up to make use of his
ability<00:01:05.250> sand<00:01:05.549> veil<00:01:05.790> which<00:01:06.180> makes<00:01:06.479> the

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
ability sand veil which makes the

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.730 
ability sand veil which makes the
opponent<00:01:07.080> miss<00:01:07.729> twenty<00:01:08.729> percent<00:01:09.630> more<00:01:10.260> than

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
opponent miss twenty percent more than

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.800 
opponent miss twenty percent more than
they<00:01:10.920> normally<00:01:11.130> would<00:01:11.400> so<00:01:11.790> it<00:01:12.540> decreases

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
they normally would so it decreases

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.530 
they normally would so it decreases
their<00:01:13.530> accuracy<00:01:14.220> by<00:01:14.490> one-fifth<00:01:14.970> basically

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
their accuracy by one-fifth basically

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.960 
their accuracy by one-fifth basically
and<00:01:16.340> the<00:01:17.340> other<00:01:17.460> thing<00:01:17.520> you're<00:01:17.729> going<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.880> need

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
stali / annoying it works really well

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.990 
stali / annoying it works really well
too<00:03:49.229> if<00:03:49.349> your<00:03:49.439> team<00:03:49.620> has<00:03:49.650> toxic<00:03:50.280> spikes<00:03:50.579> or<00:03:50.849> if

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
too if your team has toxic spikes or if

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.179 
too if your team has toxic spikes or if
you<00:03:51.180> just<00:03:51.209> have<00:03:51.359> a<00:03:51.479> few<00:03:51.750> good<00:03:51.930> walls<00:03:52.290> like

you just have a few good walls like

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:55.670 
you just have a few good walls like
hypno<00:03:53.639> or<00:03:53.879> something<00:03:54.299> to<00:03:54.540> lay<00:03:54.870> the<00:03:55.049> toxic<00:03:55.530> down

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
hypno or something to lay the toxic down

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.559 
hypno or something to lay the toxic down
on<00:03:55.859> your<00:03:55.979> opponent's<00:03:56.370> team<00:03:56.549> because<00:03:57.329> you<00:03:57.449> can

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
on your opponent's team because you can

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:01.219 
on your opponent's team because you can
easily<00:03:57.750> stall<00:03:58.290> them<00:03:58.500> out<00:03:58.680> and<00:04:00.019> poison<00:04:01.019> types

easily stall them out and poison types

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:02.689 
easily stall them out and poison types
are<00:04:01.409> weak<00:04:01.560> to<00:04:01.709> ground<00:04:01.979> so<00:04:02.280> if<00:04:02.400> you<00:04:02.489> can't

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:02.699 
are weak to ground so if you can't

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:04.189 
are weak to ground so if you can't
poison<00:04:03.150> them<00:04:03.299> you'll<00:04:03.659> be<00:04:03.720> able<00:04:03.840> to<00:04:03.959> hit<00:04:04.049> them
