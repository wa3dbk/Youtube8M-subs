00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:10.080
 to braid your braid around your head 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:13.549
 divide the hair into zones of weaving from 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:18.410
 one ear to the other will draw a line and 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:18.410
 separate the hair securing them with clips 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:34.110
 from this line we will hold a vertical 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:39.360
 line of weaving zone and also 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:42.600
 fasten with clamps start weaving 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.860
 from this line in order to 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.950
 coming to his forehead 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.120
 Spit gained volume and looked more 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.360
 effectively doing hair in three parts and 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:57.590
 weave a reverse French braid 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.590
 braid trudges brought 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.260
 separate the hair strand from above 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:31.740
 grab large and index 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.740
 finger and weave 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:42.820
 Similarly, grabbing a strand of hair from below 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:46.220
 and weaving into the cashier 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:49.520
 we try to weave in the middle between the line 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.880
 which we conducted and the hairline start 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.880
 on the back of the head 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:06.010
 so that the spit was more voluminous a little bit 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.010
 we take out strands 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.519
 note 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.049
 until you plait braided white hand was 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:38.049
 above and right below 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:50.590
 Now you need to change hands tightly 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.590
 we hold the strands and change hands 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.020
 and continue weaving 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.970
 top strand captured and plaited 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.069
 there are some 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.020
 bottom strand 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:40.390
 again under the bottom so I continue weaving 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:45.090
 along the forehead line adding all new and 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.090
 new strands on top 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.750
 and bottom 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.760
 top strand added 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.000
 and bottom 

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:44.519
 5 slightly pulled hair and plexus 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.519
 so that the spit was more voluminous 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.800
 finish weaving 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:02.500
 we fasten with a rubber band 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:06.180
 now free tail braid need 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.180
 put under the hair 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:13.650
 pin up the studs 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:19.780
 so that it was not visible 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:25.870
 front we hide a pigtail under the weave 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:32.770
 and also we fix invisible 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.259
 and left tail to hide 

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:22.520
 got a scythe around your head 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:22.520
 we hid the braid under the weave 

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:33.639
 There is another option such a hairstyle 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:35.909
 when the pigtail is not hidden under the weaving and 

00:06:33.639 --> 00:06:38.439
 fit in bundle 

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:41.999
