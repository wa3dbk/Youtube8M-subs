00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:05.730
 hi everyone green papa is a chain of 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.870
 mini is very famous in Japan had 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.760
 showed mine also in another 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.969
 video in which I eat a cream puff 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.370
 fabulous cream today from the bird and dad I have 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.870
 got a chocolate cake the 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.699
 pope werth chocolate cake not 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.400
 I've never tried it and I've always been 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.199
 promised to do so and unfortunately not 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.019
 sell in all bird outlets 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.130
 and dad but only in some at least it is 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.289
 this is what I seem to remember 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.740
 from the site where I do not know how much the months 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.510
 hot 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.680
 I point out to you that inside the 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.510
 pack of the falls a bag 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.340
 I will also put a piece of ice that 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.010
 now it was almost loose 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.820
 to make a face of bringing home the 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.190
 fresh product because if you want to buy 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.110
 a chocolate cake then you have to 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.030
 make you an hour by train where a little bit 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.940
 warm perhaps with chocolate cake 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.500
 may slightly melt but not 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.829
 because of chocolate but any 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.750
 produced a ticket all in Japan 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:08.189
 put it with the vertices I brought with 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:13.110
 the ice this is such is written 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:15.380
 8 you see fact I asked him is 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.380
 thing 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:21.690
 good heavens 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.200
 and nothing would perhaps be warmed by me 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.200
 I asked him 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.960
 I don't care told me it was 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.040
 better eat it cold then I go to 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.440
 eat this chocolate cake 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.440
 free from pope for you and I'll tell you how 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.030
 not good cold while hot it was 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:55.299
 good but cold is fine but that 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.299
 show 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.810
 Mamma Mia 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:12.190
 very high mark if it is not high 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.190
 I do n't like pastry 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:35.200
 this seems to me a divine wine 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.200
 joke of the divine 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.180
 very beautifull 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:21.510
 ie the mini food on a high level 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:25.680
 this as a vote perhaps exceeds vineyards 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.680
 really good indeed 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:34.500
 to be honest I did not expect it 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.230
 much drier inside and 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.400
 on the outside 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.110
 unfortunately I expected it on consensus 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.890
 who put both had been dry not 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:45.420
 I would have loved when I saw it 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:48.720
 from photos and reproductions in 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.460
 plastic that was there I would have thought 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.920
 that would have been a product a little bit 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:56.330
 more dry, on the other hand, is not a dry product 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.740
 too dry, that is, you have seen it too 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:02.430
 that chocolate says inside and 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:04.650
 everything else is really wet no 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.710
 how to say you understood from which wet 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:11.250
 that there is a little good as you were or 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:12.810
 I don't do other product placements 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:18.420
 you know what are the product placement 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:20.430
 ie not from series that do so much not in 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:22.470
 america but now also in italy 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.350
 series that are few pope green mangel 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.970
 no well this beautiful will tell me if i am 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.070
 some dad and manager bird say 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:35.900
 look at my VCR and about 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:35.900
 with the name I think 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:44.610
 then you are wondering where 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:48.330
 this elected formatively e 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:51.510

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:54.120

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:57.740

00:04:54.120 --> 00:05:01.380

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:20.820

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:35.490
