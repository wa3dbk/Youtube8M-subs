you can see in this example in my
opinion<00:01:27.360> that<00:01:27.479> these<00:01:27.810> are<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.080> best

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
opinion that these are the best

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.929 
opinion that these are the best
situations<00:01:28.890> on<00:01:29.040> where<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.369> use<00:01:29.549> at<00:01:29.790> this

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
situations on where to use at this

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.999 
situations on where to use at this

screen move and yeah I'd like to go on

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.609 
screen move and yeah I'd like to go on
with<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.549> next<00:01:32.580> one<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.840> next<00:01:33.869> skill<00:01:34.320> move<00:01:34.470> I

this<00:01:47.369> controller<00:01:48.000> animation<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:48.630> just<00:01:48.900> flick

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
this controller animation you just flick

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.319 
this controller animation you just flick
your<00:01:49.530> right<00:01:49.740> stick<00:01:50.040> diagonal<00:01:50.610> back<00:01:50.909> twice<00:01:51.270> to

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
your right stick diagonal back twice to

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.660 
your right stick diagonal back twice to
the<00:01:51.600> left<00:01:51.899> or<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.409> right<00:01:52.560> side<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.220> that's

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
the left or to the right side and that's

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.639 
the left or to the right side and that's
already<00:01:54.000> it's<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.420> really<00:01:54.720> easy<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.320> you<00:01:55.439> only

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
already it's a really easy and you only

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.800 
already it's a really easy and you only
need<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:55.950> four<00:01:56.399> star<00:01:56.729> skills<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.360> do<00:01:57.479> it<00:01:57.509> so<00:01:57.780> I

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
need a four star skills to do it so I

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.499 
need a four star skills to do it so I
think<00:01:58.079> in<00:01:58.560> my<00:01:58.710> opinion<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:59.340> i<00:01:59.970> only<00:02:00.149> played

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
think in my opinion and i only played

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.679 
think in my opinion and i only played
the<00:02:00.810> demo<00:02:00.990> but<00:02:01.560> i<00:02:01.710> think<00:02:02.130> this<00:02:02.490> skill<00:02:03.030> move<00:02:03.210> can

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
the demo but i think this skill move can

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.020 
the demo but i think this skill move can
easily<00:02:04.409> become<00:02:04.950> become<00:02:05.520> one<00:02:05.729> of<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:06.000> most

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
easily become become one of the most

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.180 
easily become become one of the most
effective<00:02:07.020> skin<00:02:07.350> moves<00:02:07.439> in<00:02:07.649> the<00:02:07.770> game<00:02:07.799> easily

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
effective skin moves in the game easily

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.330 
effective skin moves in the game easily
top<00:02:08.610> five<00:02:08.910> of<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.690> most<00:02:09.869> effective<00:02:10.649> skin<00:02:11.190> move

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
top five of the most effective skin move

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.490 
top five of the most effective skin move
in<00:02:11.549> the<00:02:11.670> game<00:02:11.820> why<00:02:12.390> because<00:02:12.810> it<00:02:12.959> has<00:02:13.140> a<00:02:13.170> really

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
in the game why because it has a really

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.800 
in the game why because it has a really
flexible<00:02:13.769> usage<00:02:14.400> you<00:02:14.880> have<00:02:15.030> an<00:02:15.150> instant<00:02:15.630> turn

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
flexible usage you have an instant turn

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.170 
flexible usage you have an instant turn
of<00:02:15.959> direction<00:02:16.500> so<00:02:16.860> you<00:02:16.950> can<00:02:17.130> use<00:02:17.310> it<00:02:17.340> in<00:02:17.610> many

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
of direction so you can use it in many

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.199 
of direction so you can use it in many
ways<00:02:18.650> same<00:02:19.650> as<00:02:19.920> with<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.190> alternate<00:02:20.790> huge<00:02:21.000> job

while<00:02:28.829> doing<00:02:29.070> this<00:02:29.340> move<00:02:29.760> last<00:02:30.329> but<00:02:30.570> not<00:02:30.600> least

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
while doing this move last but not least

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.379 
while doing this move last but not least
there<00:02:31.169> the<00:02:31.320> third<00:02:31.560> skin<00:02:32.370> move<00:02:32.549> called<00:02:32.910> a<00:02:33.120> heel

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:33.389 
there the third skin move called a heel

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:34.760 
there the third skin move called a heel
to<00:02:33.780> toe

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
to toe

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.530 
to toe
and<00:02:34.830> it<00:02:35.190> looks<00:02:35.400> really<00:02:35.610> similar<00:02:36.150> to<00:02:36.360> the

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
and it looks really similar to the

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.230 
and it looks really similar to the
elastico<00:02:37.230> in<00:02:37.380> my<00:02:37.500> opinion<00:02:37.830> so<00:02:38.160> I<00:02:38.430> don't<00:02:39.030> think

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
elastico in my opinion so I don't think

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.350 
elastico in my opinion so I don't think
it<00:02:39.510> will<00:02:39.750> yeah<00:02:40.740> it<00:02:41.040> don't<00:02:41.160> think<00:02:41.430> it<00:02:41.550> will<00:02:41.760> be

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
it will yeah it don't think it will be

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.200 
it will yeah it don't think it will be
used<00:02:42.630> very<00:02:43.110> much<00:02:43.290> and<00:02:43.800> it's<00:02:44.370> also<00:02:44.520> not<00:02:44.760> really

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
used very much and it's also not really

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:48.230 
used very much and it's also not really
effective<00:02:45.540> or<00:02:46.020> spectacular<00:02:46.860> so<00:02:47.070> yeah<00:02:47.220> I<00:02:47.460> don't

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
effective or spectacular so yeah I don't

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.320 
effective or spectacular so yeah I don't
think<00:02:48.420> this<00:02:48.690> skin<00:02:49.230> move<00:02:49.380> is<00:02:49.590> any<00:02:49.920> good<00:02:50.520> that's

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
think this skin move is any good that's

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.200 
think this skin move is any good that's
just<00:02:51.750> it<00:02:51.930> and<00:02:52.170> the<00:02:52.500> controls<00:02:52.890> are<00:02:53.070> hold<00:02:53.340> LT<00:02:53.970> and

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
just it and the controls are hold LT and

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.120 
just it and the controls are hold LT and
then<00:02:54.360> you're<00:02:54.930> right<00:02:55.140> stick<00:02:55.470> is<00:02:55.620> swing<00:02:55.890> it<00:02:56.010> to

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
then you're right stick is swing it to

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.220 
then you're right stick is swing it to
the<00:02:56.220> right<00:02:56.400> then<00:02:57.000> down<00:02:57.240> and<00:02:57.510> then<00:02:57.570> to<00:02:57.960> the<00:02:58.080> left

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
the right then down and then to the left

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.620 
the right then down and then to the left
so<00:02:58.590> also<00:02:59.220> not<00:02:59.670> that<00:02:59.970> hard<00:03:00.300> it's<00:03:00.480> not

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
so also not that hard it's not

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.350 
so also not that hard it's not
completely<00:03:01.200> easy<00:03:01.470> like<00:03:01.770> the<00:03:01.950> spin<00:03:02.910> left<00:03:03.060> right

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
completely easy like the spin left right

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.840 
completely easy like the spin left right
skill<00:03:03.600> but<00:03:03.750> it's<00:03:03.930> not<00:03:04.080> that<00:03:04.110> hard<00:03:04.470> either<00:03:04.850> for

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
skill but it's not that hard either for

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.150 
skill but it's not that hard either for
this<00:03:05.970> move<00:03:06.270> as<00:03:06.510> well<00:03:06.810> you<00:03:07.410> can<00:03:07.470> do<00:03:07.710> it<00:03:07.860> while
