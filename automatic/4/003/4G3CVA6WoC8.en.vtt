00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
kicking but you will figure having seven

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.170 
kicking but you will figure having seven
puppies<00:02:00.920> in<00:02:01.100> there<00:02:01.280> saying<00:02:01.520> her<00:02:01.850> belly<00:02:02.030> would

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
puppies in there saying her belly would

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.950 
puppies in there saying her belly would
be<00:02:02.360> going<00:02:02.510> crazy

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.020 

well<00:02:05.960> I<00:02:05.990> see<00:02:06.170> summer<00:02:06.409> here<00:02:06.820> right<00:02:07.820> there's

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
well I see summer here right there's

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.920 
well I see summer here right there's
kicking<00:02:10.209> but<00:02:11.209> I<00:02:11.239> noticed<00:02:11.690> that<00:02:11.750> they're

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
kicking but I noticed that they're

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.870 
kicking but I noticed that they're
usually<00:02:12.110> on<00:02:12.320> one<00:02:12.709> side<00:02:13.040> of<00:02:13.220> the<00:02:13.370> the<00:02:13.700> belly

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
usually on one side of the the belly

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.500 
usually on one side of the the belly
more<00:02:14.209> so<00:02:14.959> I<00:02:15.459> think<00:02:16.459> they're<00:02:16.580> more<00:02:16.760> active<00:02:17.030> on

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
more so I think they're more active on

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:31.830 
more so I think they're more active on
this<00:02:17.989> side<00:02:18.230> where<00:02:18.380> she's<00:02:18.560> laying<00:02:19.840> so
