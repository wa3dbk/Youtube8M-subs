00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
you liked it so that's pretty much the

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.279 
you liked it so that's pretty much the
topic<00:00:14.370> of<00:00:14.490> a<00:00:14.549> video<00:00:14.790> so<00:00:15.179> I<00:00:15.450> use<00:00:15.750> Claire<00:00:16.139> all

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
topic of a video so I use Claire all

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.790 
topic of a video so I use Claire all
nice<00:00:16.710> and<00:00:16.920> easy<00:00:17.660> natural<00:00:18.660> light<00:00:18.840> Auburn<00:00:19.230> 6r1

one<00:00:20.130> oh<00:00:20.279> it<00:00:20.760> looks<00:00:20.939> like<00:00:21.150> that<00:00:21.710> but<00:00:22.710> I<00:00:22.769> think

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
one oh it looks like that but I think

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.730 
one oh it looks like that but I think
it's<00:00:23.070> pretty<00:00:23.250> similar<00:00:23.519> so<00:00:24.300> I<00:00:24.630> think<00:00:25.320> it<00:00:25.560> did

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
it's pretty similar so I think it did

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.000 
it's pretty similar so I think it did
its<00:00:25.890> job<00:00:26.630> it<00:00:27.630> says<00:00:28.170> if<00:00:28.439> you're<00:00:28.529> dark<00:00:28.769> blonde

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
its job it says if you're dark blonde

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.970 
its job it says if you're dark blonde
you'd<00:00:29.220> end<00:00:29.369> up<00:00:29.460> this<00:00:29.580> color<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:30.179> I'll<00:00:30.359> leave<00:00:30.570> a

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:30.980 
you'd end up this color and I'll leave a

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.010 
you'd end up this color and I'll leave a
link<00:00:31.980> down<00:00:32.189> below<00:00:32.399> of<00:00:32.759> my<00:00:32.940> previous<00:00:33.390> video<00:00:33.719> of

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
link down below of my previous video of

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.889 
link down below of my previous video of
what<00:00:34.559> my<00:00:34.590> hair<00:00:34.829> used<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.100> look<00:00:35.250> like<00:00:35.480> and<00:00:36.480> I'll

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
what my hair used to look like and I'll

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.470 
what my hair used to look like and I'll
bring<00:00:37.469> up<00:00:37.620> that<00:00:37.800> now<00:00:38.190> I<00:00:38.550> pretty<00:00:39.000> much<00:00:39.120> watched

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480
