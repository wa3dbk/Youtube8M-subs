back<00:02:10.429> to<00:02:10.700> the<00:02:10.820> battery<00:02:11.180> here<00:02:11.390> so<00:02:11.600> I<00:02:11.630> was<00:02:11.720> able

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
back to the battery here so I was able

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.210 
back to the battery here so I was able
to<00:02:11.990> track<00:02:12.080> him<00:02:12.260> down<00:02:12.290> here<00:02:12.710> was<00:02:12.830> one<00:02:12.980> of<00:02:13.100> them

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
to track him down here was one of them

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.460 
to track him down here was one of them
and<00:02:13.370> then<00:02:14.300> here<00:02:14.420> was<00:02:14.510> the<00:02:14.630> other<00:02:14.750> one<00:02:14.930> and

and then here was the other one and

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.500 
and then here was the other one and
those<00:02:15.650> are<00:02:15.680> two<00:02:15.920> wired<00:02:16.190> back<00:02:16.430> into<00:02:17.330> the<00:02:17.390> same

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
those are two wired back into the same

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.600 
those are two wired back into the same
areas<00:02:17.780> of<00:02:17.840> Brad<00:02:17.990> set<00:02:18.230> to<00:02:18.320> the<00:02:18.410> relay<00:02:18.709> to<00:02:19.459> allow

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
areas of Brad set to the relay to allow

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.490 
areas of Brad set to the relay to allow
the<00:02:19.640> ignition<00:02:20.090> to<00:02:20.450> close<00:02:20.660> like<00:02:20.900> emulating<00:02:21.470> the

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
the ignition to close like emulating the

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.040 
the ignition to close like emulating the
key<00:02:21.680> switch<00:02:21.950> in<00:02:22.100> front<00:02:22.510> that<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:23.630> power<00:02:23.810> off

the<00:02:24.200> battery<00:02:24.470> supply<00:02:24.680> here<00:02:24.980> I<00:02:25.130> got<00:02:25.520> the

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
the battery supply here I got the

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.610 
the battery supply here I got the
batteries<00:02:25.940> go<00:02:26.720> there<00:02:26.900> and<00:02:27.050> then<00:02:27.140> grounded<00:02:27.470> the

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
batteries go there and then grounded the

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.979 
batteries go there and then grounded the
system<00:02:28.220> to<00:02:28.310> the<00:02:28.370> ground<00:02:28.970> back<00:02:29.150> here<00:02:29.390> on<00:02:29.840> the

LED<00:03:00.860> is<00:03:00.950> on<00:03:01.070> next<00:03:02.000> thing<00:03:02.180> to<00:03:02.239> do<00:03:02.390> is<00:03:02.420> to<00:03:02.540> pair<00:03:03.050> it

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
LED is on next thing to do is to pair it

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.620 
LED is on next thing to do is to pair it
to<00:03:03.200> the<00:03:03.290> phone<00:03:03.470> before<00:03:03.680> he<00:03:03.890> pulls<00:03:04.100> it<00:03:04.220> all<00:03:04.310> up

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
to the phone before he pulls it all up

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.780 
to the phone before he pulls it all up
so<00:03:05.630> we<00:03:05.690> get<00:03:05.870> the<00:03:05.959> phone<00:03:06.170> set<00:03:06.770> up<00:03:06.890> to<00:03:07.070> pairing
