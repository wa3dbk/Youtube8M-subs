we're<00:01:52.830> gonna<00:01:52.979> run<00:01:53.130> Darcy's<00:01:53.490> on<00:01:53.729> that<00:01:53.880> side<00:01:54.060> we

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
we're gonna run Darcy's on that side we

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.779 
we're gonna run Darcy's on that side we
got<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.080> remote<00:01:55.440> wire<00:01:55.619> sliced<00:01:56.160> on<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.640> the

got the remote wire sliced on to the

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:00.550 
got the remote wire sliced on to the
stereo<00:01:57.780> one<00:01:58.009> so<00:01:59.009> it<00:01:59.069> goes<00:01:59.340> down<00:01:59.520> through<00:01:59.700> here

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
stereo one so it goes down through here

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.590 
stereo one so it goes down through here
come<00:02:01.560> together<00:02:01.740> so<00:02:02.130> we<00:02:02.250> got<00:02:02.429> the<00:02:03.149> remote<00:02:03.390> and

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
come together so we got the remote and

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.660 
come together so we got the remote and
the<00:02:03.840> power<00:02:04.020> wire<00:02:04.200> together<00:02:04.319> because<00:02:05.310> these

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
the power wire together because these

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.270 
the power wire together because these
have<00:02:05.880> 12<00:02:06.330> volts<00:02:06.569> on<00:02:06.690> them<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.830> the<00:02:07.920> our<00:02:08.039> C's

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
have 12 volts on them and the our C's

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.499 
have 12 volts on them and the our C's
will<00:02:08.459> go<00:02:08.580> on<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.759> opposite<00:02:09.060> side<00:02:09.270> so<00:02:09.300> you

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
will go on the opposite side so you

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.059 
will go on the opposite side so you
hardly<00:02:09.780> any<00:02:10.020> static<00:02:10.440> noise<00:02:10.740> or<00:02:10.920> anything

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
hardly any static noise or anything

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.480 
hardly any static noise or anything
gonna

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
gonna
