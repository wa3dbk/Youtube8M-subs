00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
it was just a quick matter of time until

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.550 
it was just a quick matter of time until
he<00:01:26.390> was<00:01:26.480> going<00:01:26.600> to<00:01:26.660> get<00:01:26.810> his<00:01:26.930> top<00:01:27.110> result<00:01:27.440> cuz

and<00:01:34.630> I'm<00:01:35.630> sure<00:01:35.840> it<00:01:36.050> at<00:01:36.409> home<00:01:36.740> it<00:01:36.770> was<00:01:37.010> a<00:01:37.040> very

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
and I'm sure it at home it was a very

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.890 
and I'm sure it at home it was a very
spectacular<00:01:37.640> race<00:01:38.180> and<00:01:38.390> there's<00:01:38.540> so<00:01:38.750> much

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
spectacular race and there's so much

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.899 
spectacular race and there's so much
happening<00:01:39.080> and<00:01:39.440> if<00:01:39.860> one<00:01:40.130> I<00:01:40.370> think<00:01:40.700> you<00:01:40.760> know<00:01:40.880> a

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
happening and if one I think you know a

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:42.580 
happening and if one I think you know a
lot<00:01:41.090> of<00:01:41.150> people<00:01:41.240> are<00:01:41.540> saying<00:01:41.690> arts<00:01:42.020> to<00:01:42.260> two

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
lot of people are saying arts to two

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.560 
lot of people are saying arts to two
random<00:01:43.040> to<00:01:43.310> whatever<00:01:43.730> but<00:01:44.210> I<00:01:44.300> think<00:01:44.479> it's

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
random to whatever but I think it's

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.020 
random to whatever but I think it's
great<00:01:44.690> it's<00:01:44.930> great<00:01:44.960> for<00:01:45.229> racing<00:01:45.620> and<00:01:45.850> the<00:01:46.850> same

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
great it's great for racing and the same

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.670 
great it's great for racing and the same
people<00:01:47.450> are<00:01:47.570> still<00:01:47.810> you<00:01:48.020> know<00:01:48.110> winning<00:01:48.530> and

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
people are still you know winning and

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.680 
people are still you know winning and
it's<00:01:49.040> the<00:01:49.490> picture<00:01:49.880> is<00:01:49.940> becoming<00:01:50.330> clearer<00:01:50.510> and

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
it's the picture is becoming clearer and

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:51.820 
it's the picture is becoming clearer and
clearer<00:01:50.870> who<00:01:51.050> is<00:01:51.140> going<00:01:51.320> to<00:01:51.409> really<00:01:51.590> be<00:01:51.650> a

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
clearer who is going to really be a

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.890 
clearer who is going to really be a
favorite<00:01:52.310> for<00:01:52.490> the<00:01:52.550> championship<00:01:52.940> so<00:01:53.720> I<00:01:53.750> think

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 
favorite for the championship so I think

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.469 
favorite for the championship so I think
you<00:01:54.170> know<00:01:54.370> it's<00:01:55.370> not<00:01:55.550> a<00:01:55.580> completely<00:01:55.790> random

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
you know it's not a completely random

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.240 
you know it's not a completely random
thing<00:01:57.200> and<00:01:57.380> it's<00:01:57.470> just<00:01:57.650> very<00:01:57.740> exciting

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
thing and it's just very exciting

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.890 
thing and it's just very exciting
especially<00:01:58.430> due<00:01:59.060> to<00:01:59.090> the<00:01:59.299> tires<00:01:59.510> which<00:01:59.780> is

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 
especially due to the tires which is

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.170 
especially due to the tires which is
great<00:02:00.110> and<00:02:00.380> there<00:02:01.070> I<00:02:01.100> for<00:02:01.880> me<00:02:01.970> it's<00:02:02.090> just

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
great and there I for me it's just

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.640
