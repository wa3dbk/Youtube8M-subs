what<00:00:00.390> if<00:00:00.480> I<00:00:00.570> was<00:00:00.750> to<00:00:00.870> tell<00:00:01.050> you<00:00:01.199> that<00:00:01.650> I<00:00:01.709> could

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
what if I was to tell you that I could

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:03.919 
what if I was to tell you that I could
take<00:00:02.040> this<00:00:02.250> board<00:00:02.580> and<00:00:02.850> bend<00:00:03.629> it<00:00:03.720> like<00:00:03.780> a

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
take this board and bend it like a

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.690 
take this board and bend it like a
slinky<00:00:05.029> would<00:00:06.029> you<00:00:06.120> like<00:00:06.240> to<00:00:06.390> see<00:00:06.540> that<00:00:07.370> yeah<00:00:08.370> I

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
slinky would you like to see that yeah I

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:19.939 
slinky would you like to see that yeah I
think<00:00:09.540> I<00:00:09.840> would<00:00:09.900> too<00:00:18.289> so<00:00:19.289> we<00:00:19.500> heat<00:00:19.710> is<00:00:19.920> a

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
think I would too so we heat is a

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.560 
think I would too so we heat is a
measurement<00:00:20.369> of<00:00:20.550> an<00:00:20.970> inch<00:00:21.119> up<00:00:21.359> from<00:00:21.480> the

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
measurement of an inch up from the

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.779 
measurement of an inch up from the
bottom<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:22.109> half<00:00:22.590> an<00:00:22.740> inch<00:00:22.890> in<00:00:23.130> from<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.519> side

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
bottom and half an inch in from the side

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.910 
bottom and half an inch in from the side
so<00:00:24.210> what<00:00:24.420> we<00:00:24.510> should<00:00:24.720> have<00:00:24.960> it's<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.410> half<00:00:25.619> inch

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
so what we should have it's a half inch

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.220 
so what we should have it's a half inch
margin<00:00:26.699> all<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.090> way<00:00:27.210> around<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:27.930> that

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
margin all the way around and that

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.919 
margin all the way around and that
should<00:00:28.529> make<00:00:28.560> more<00:00:28.890> sense<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.400> little<00:00:29.550> bit

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:29.929 
should make more sense a little bit

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:35.020 
should make more sense a little bit
here's<00:00:30.929> my<00:00:31.279> process<00:00:32.279> I<00:00:32.579> have<00:00:33.149> eight<00:00:33.660> strips<00:00:34.469> of

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
here's my process I have eight strips of

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.090 
here's my process I have eight strips of
wood<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.450> when<00:00:37.170> I<00:00:37.200> originally<00:00:37.440> cut<00:00:37.950> these

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
wood and when I originally cut these

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.560 
wood and when I originally cut these
these<00:00:38.370> were<00:00:38.550> supposed<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:38.969> be<00:00:39.149> one-eighth<00:00:39.540> of

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
these were supposed to be one-eighth of

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.240 
these were supposed to be one-eighth of
an<00:00:39.809> inch<00:00:39.930> but<00:00:40.290> they're<00:00:40.500> not<00:00:40.710> they're<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:40.980> little

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
an inch but they're not they're a little

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.069 
an inch but they're not they're a little
thicker<00:00:41.460> than<00:00:41.550> that<00:00:41.850> I'm<00:00:42.090> going<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.480> just<00:00:42.719> call

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
thicker than that I'm going to just call

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.830 
thicker than that I'm going to just call
them<00:00:43.350> units<00:00:43.980> so<00:00:44.610> what<00:00:44.789> I<00:00:44.820> did<00:00:44.940> next<00:00:45.360> was<00:00:45.570> I<00:00:45.780> took

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
them units so what I did next was I took

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.430 
them units so what I did next was I took
eight<00:00:46.200> of<00:00:46.620> these<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.280> I<00:00:47.640> used<00:00:47.969> that<00:00:48.480> to

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
eight of these and I used that to

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.430 
eight of these and I used that to
measure<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:50.070> thickness<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.910> cut<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.840> piece<00:00:52.199> of

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
measure a thickness and cut a piece of

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.630 
measure a thickness and cut a piece of
scrap<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:54.030> match<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.690> lastly<00:00:55.260> this<00:00:55.920> board<00:00:56.370> is

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
scrap to match and lastly this board is

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.770 
scrap to match and lastly this board is
equal<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.780> 16<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:59.010> these<00:00:59.430> units<00:00:59.940> all<00:01:00.510> right<00:01:00.629> so

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
equal to 16 of these units all right so

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.080 
equal to 16 of these units all right so
now<00:01:00.899> we've<00:01:01.050> got<00:01:01.230> all<00:01:01.440> we<00:01:01.859> should<00:01:01.920> need<00:01:02.399> for

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
now we've got all we should need for

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.770 
now we've got all we should need for
uniform<00:01:04.040> slicing<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.220> almost<00:01:05.909> no<00:01:06.240> math<00:01:06.479> was

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
uniform slicing and almost no math was

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.609 
uniform slicing and almost no math was
involved<00:01:07.290> because<00:01:07.920> I<00:01:08.900> just<00:01:09.900> I'm<00:01:10.080> not<00:01:10.320> a<00:01:10.350> math

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
involved because I just I'm not a math

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.039 
involved because I just I'm not a math

flexible I will put the link to your

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.170 
flexible I will put the link to your
website<00:01:28.320> in<00:01:28.800> the<00:01:28.860> description<00:01:29.010> that<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:29.909> would

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
website in the description that I would

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:36.490 
website in the description that I would
encourage<00:01:30.780> you<00:01:31.050> to<00:01:31.290> go<00:01:31.619> take<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.190> look

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.530 

and<00:01:36.590> then<00:01:37.130> it's<00:01:37.250> just<00:01:37.370> a<00:01:37.520> matter<00:01:37.550> of<00:01:37.820> having<00:01:38.300> a

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
and then it's just a matter of having a

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.290 
and then it's just a matter of having a
fence<00:01:38.870> on<00:01:39.140> the<00:01:39.530> bandsaw<00:01:40.070> that<00:01:40.340> is<00:01:40.580> parallel<00:01:41.270> to

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300 
fence on the bandsaw that is parallel to

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.390 
fence on the bandsaw that is parallel to
the<00:01:41.480> blade<00:01:41.690> and<00:01:42.350> then<00:01:42.740> we<00:01:42.860> can<00:01:43.010> start<00:01:43.220> using

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 
the blade and then we can start using

00:01:43.400 --> 00:02:19.420 
the blade and then we can start using
our<00:01:43.760> units<00:01:44.510> to<00:01:45.230> offset<00:01:45.710> it

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.589 

okay<00:02:20.430> woods<00:02:21.300> not<00:02:21.510> supposed<00:02:21.989> to<00:02:22.110> do<00:02:22.739> that

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
okay woods not supposed to do that

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:31.580 
okay woods not supposed to do that
look<00:02:24.599> at<00:02:24.750> that<00:02:29.540> so<00:02:30.540> what<00:02:31.140> are<00:02:31.200> you<00:02:31.260> going<00:02:31.410> to<00:02:31.470> do

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
look at that so what are you going to do

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.559 
look at that so what are you going to do
with<00:02:31.739> this<00:02:31.920> I<00:02:32.160> can<00:02:32.580> think<00:02:32.700> of<00:02:32.849> a<00:02:32.940> few<00:02:33.120> project

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
with this I can think of a few project

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.150 
with this I can think of a few project
ideas<00:02:33.930> that<00:02:34.080> might<00:02:34.230> be<00:02:34.379> pretty<00:02:34.530> neat<00:02:34.830> the

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
ideas that might be pretty neat the

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.610 
ideas that might be pretty neat the
technique<00:02:35.580> isn't<00:02:36.030> difficult<00:02:36.420> head<00:02:37.349> out<00:02:37.470> to

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
technique isn't difficult head out to

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.060 
technique isn't difficult head out to
the<00:02:37.709> shop<00:02:37.920> and<00:02:38.220> give<00:02:38.670> it<00:02:38.760> a<00:02:38.819> shot
