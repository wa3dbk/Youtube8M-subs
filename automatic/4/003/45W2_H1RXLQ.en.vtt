00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
impressive thing about this bat of

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.000 
impressive thing about this bat of
course<00:01:00.239> is<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.840> shape<00:01:01.109> which<00:01:01.379> we<00:01:01.559> love<00:01:01.770> so

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
course is the shape which we love so

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.289 
course is the shape which we love so
it's<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.219> full-on<00:01:02.489> players<00:01:03.000> shape<00:01:03.949> nice<00:01:05.299> thick

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
it's a full-on players shape nice thick

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.330 
it's a full-on players shape nice thick
up<00:01:06.600> there<00:01:06.990> towards<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.619> shoulders<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.280> a

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
up there towards the shoulders and a

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.770 
up there towards the shoulders and a
quite<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.670> chunky<00:01:09.180> toe<00:01:09.390> as<00:01:09.600> you'll<00:01:09.750> probably

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
quite a chunky toe as you'll probably

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.890 
quite a chunky toe as you'll probably
see<00:01:10.439> so<00:01:10.770> although<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.850> centre<00:01:12.360> doesn't

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
see so although the centre doesn't

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.780 
see so although the centre doesn't
extend<00:01:13.290> all<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.590> way<00:01:13.920> down<00:01:14.189> that's<00:01:14.430> how<00:01:14.520> is

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
extend all the way down that's how is

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.670 
extend all the way down that's how is
still<00:01:14.970> quite<00:01:15.240> thick<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.750> which<00:01:16.259> means<00:01:16.500> it's

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
still quite thick and which means it's

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.840 
still quite thick and which means it's
going<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.860> be<00:01:16.979> durable<00:01:17.280> it's<00:01:17.520> not<00:01:17.640> going<00:01:17.790> to

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
going to be durable it's not going to

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.429 
going to be durable it's not going to
break<00:01:18.060> on<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.420> as<00:01:18.810> long<00:01:18.840> as<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.140> look<00:01:19.259> after

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
break on you as long as you look after

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.270 
break on you as long as you look after
your<00:01:19.650> bat<00:01:19.799> of<00:01:19.950> course

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
greater timber that this thing's made

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.630 
greater timber that this thing's made
out<00:01:36.780> of<00:01:36.930> it's<00:01:37.409> going<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.650> tap<00:01:37.829> very<00:01:38.159> very<00:01:38.460> well

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
out of it's going to tap very very well

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.950 
out of it's going to tap very very well
which<00:01:38.790> we'll<00:01:38.970> show<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:39.180> right<00:01:39.450> now<00:01:39.689> and

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
because of that shape it's going to help

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.819 
because of that shape it's going to help
extend<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.540> size<00:01:42.869> of<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.200> so<00:01:43.320> it's<00:01:43.439> very<00:01:43.619> well

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
extend the size of it so it's very well

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:50.389

distributed throughout the bat so even

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.480 
distributed throughout the bat so even
lower<00:01:50.610> down<00:01:50.909> because<00:01:51.240> it's<00:01:51.390> so<00:01:51.570> thick<00:01:52.490> how

pretty forgiving given that that shape

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.290 
pretty forgiving given that that shape
is<00:02:12.019> that<00:02:12.560> player<00:02:12.830> specs<00:02:13.340> are<00:02:13.519> not<00:02:13.670> sacrificing
