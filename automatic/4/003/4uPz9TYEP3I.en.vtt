this video is gonna be part two in this

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.170 
this video is gonna be part two in this
series<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.279> in<00:00:23.430> this<00:00:23.550> one<00:00:23.790> we're<00:00:24.029> gonna

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
series and in this one we're gonna

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.429 
series and in this one we're gonna
actually<00:00:24.900> make<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:26.330> LED<00:00:27.330> panels<00:00:28.050> that<00:00:28.259> will

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
actually make the LED panels that will

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.860 
actually make the LED panels that will
go<00:00:28.590> in<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.829> fixture<00:00:30.050> grab<00:00:31.050> these<00:00:32.360> the<00:00:33.360> panels

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
go in the fixture grab these the panels

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.520 
go in the fixture grab these the panels
will<00:00:34.050> consist<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.649> four<00:00:34.860> of<00:00:35.610> these<00:00:36.140> nine<00:00:37.140> by

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
will consist of four of these nine by

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.459 
will consist of four of these nine by
six<00:00:37.559> I<00:00:38.219> think<00:00:38.250> they<00:00:38.610> are<00:00:38.760> heat<00:00:39.030> sinks<00:00:39.480> these

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
six I think they are heat sinks these

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.440 
six I think they are heat sinks these
will<00:00:40.680> fit<00:00:41.160> into<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.489> fixture<00:00:42.000> I<00:00:42.030> will<00:00:42.270> show

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
will fit into the fixture I will show

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.000 
will fit into the fixture I will show
you<00:00:42.510> later<00:00:42.780> on<00:00:42.930> how<00:00:43.079> they<00:00:43.440> will<00:00:43.559> fit<00:00:43.590> into<00:00:43.890> the

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
you later on how they will fit into the

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.610 
you later on how they will fit into the
fixture<00:00:45.980> I've<00:00:46.980> kind<00:00:47.370> of<00:00:47.489> devised<00:00:48.089> a<00:00:48.390> fun<00:00:49.289> cheap

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
fixture I've kind of devised a fun cheap

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.709 
fixture I've kind of devised a fun cheap
way<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.859> have<00:00:50.160> them<00:00:50.370> situated<00:00:50.999> in<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.449> fixture

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
way to have them situated in the fixture

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.299 
way to have them situated in the fixture
that<00:00:51.929> I'll<00:00:52.079> show<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.289> later<00:00:52.410> on<00:00:52.649> but<00:00:53.160> anyway

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
that I'll show you later on but anyway

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.099 
that I'll show you later on but anyway
as<00:00:53.699> you<00:00:53.820> can<00:00:53.999> see<00:00:54.239> I've<00:00:54.659> made<00:00:54.870> up<00:00:55.019> these

00:00:55.099 --> 00:00:55.109 
as you can see I've made up these

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:58.759 
as you can see I've made up these
markups<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.210> of<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.390> panels<00:00:57.839> I've<00:00:58.559> just

00:00:58.759 --> 00:00:58.769 
markups of the of the panels I've just

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:00.169 
markups of the of the panels I've just
taken<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:59.159> piece<00:00:59.339> of<00:00:59.489> paper<00:00:59.670> and<00:00:59.909> I've<00:01:00.030> taken

00:01:00.169 --> 00:01:00.179 
taken a piece of paper and I've taken

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:03.470 
taken a piece of paper and I've taken
some<00:01:00.710> post-it<00:01:01.710> notes<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.129> I<00:01:02.190> cut<00:01:02.609> off<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.760> the

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
some post-it notes and I cut off the the

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.630 
some post-it notes and I cut off the the
sticky<00:01:03.899> parts<00:01:04.230> and<00:01:04.379> made<00:01:04.559> squares<00:01:05.220> about<00:01:05.519> the

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
sticky parts and made squares about the

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.730 
sticky parts and made squares about the
same<00:01:05.850> size<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.450> LEDs<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.170> I<00:01:07.260> put<00:01:07.440> them<00:01:07.590> on

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
same size of the LEDs and I put them on

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.180 
same size of the LEDs and I put them on
there<00:01:07.979> put<00:01:08.850> bees<00:01:09.420> for<00:01:09.750> blues<00:01:09.960> double<00:01:10.890> use<00:01:11.010> for

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.190 
there put bees for blues double use for

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.370 
there put bees for blues double use for
whites<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:11.760> I<00:01:12.120> kind<00:01:12.390> of<00:01:12.450> made<00:01:12.600> my<00:01:12.659> grid<00:01:13.170> that

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
whites and I kind of made my grid that

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.440 
whites and I kind of made my grid that
way<00:01:13.560> on<00:01:13.740> how<00:01:13.950> I'm<00:01:14.100> gonna<00:01:14.310> have<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.790> LEDs<00:01:15.210> on

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
way on how I'm gonna have the LEDs on

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.950 
way on how I'm gonna have the LEDs on
here<00:01:15.780> that<00:01:16.159> way<00:01:17.159> I<00:01:17.190> can<00:01:17.430> also<00:01:17.580> figure<00:01:17.880> out<00:01:18.150> kind

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
here that way I can also figure out kind

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.899 
here that way I can also figure out kind
of<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.170> wiring<00:01:19.799> I<00:01:19.920> need<00:01:20.159> in<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.399> measurements

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
of the wiring I need in the measurements

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.149 
of the wiring I need in the measurements
so<00:01:20.969> it's<00:01:21.329> a<00:01:21.420> good<00:01:21.570> idea<00:01:21.689> you<00:01:22.439> know<00:01:22.530> plan<00:01:22.860> plan

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
so it's a good idea you know plan plan

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.039 
so it's a good idea you know plan plan
plan<00:01:23.189> before<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:23.909> start<00:01:24.210> soldering<00:01:24.509> before

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
plan before you start soldering before

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.480 
plan before you start soldering before
you<00:01:25.140> start<00:01:25.350> gluing<00:01:25.710> or<00:01:25.829> doing<00:01:26.100> anything<00:01:26.310> like

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
you start gluing or doing anything like

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.969 
you start gluing or doing anything like
that<00:01:26.670> get<00:01:27.570> your<00:01:27.840> plan<00:01:28.079> ready<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:28.680> can<00:01:28.829> do

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
that get your plan ready and you can do

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.160 
that get your plan ready and you can do
that<00:01:29.159> while<00:01:29.399> you're<00:01:29.579> in<00:01:29.640> class<00:01:30.030> or<00:01:30.420> at<00:01:30.450> work<00:01:30.930> or

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
that while you're in class or at work or

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.660 
that while you're in class or at work or
something<00:01:31.439> like<00:01:31.590> that<00:01:31.979> if<00:01:32.159> you're<00:01:32.280> ever<00:01:32.310> bored

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
something like that if you're ever bored

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.819 
something like that if you're ever bored
he<00:01:33.240> can<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.750> can<00:01:33.899> do<00:01:34.020> something<00:01:34.380> simple<00:01:34.590> like

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
he can you can do something simple like

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.190 
he can you can do something simple like
this<00:01:34.890> so<00:01:35.880> that's<00:01:36.030> my<00:01:36.299> kind<00:01:36.539> of<00:01:36.600> plan<00:01:36.869> how<00:01:37.110> I'm

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
this so that's my kind of plan how I'm

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.800 
this so that's my kind of plan how I'm
going<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.500> set<00:01:37.770> my<00:01:37.920> LEDs<00:01:38.250> I'm<00:01:39.119> gonna<00:01:39.329> mark<00:01:39.600> this

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
going to set my LEDs I'm gonna mark this

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.880 
going to set my LEDs I'm gonna mark this
out<00:01:40.020> onto<00:01:40.289> my<00:01:41.270> onto<00:01:42.270> my<00:01:42.680> heatsink<00:01:43.680> with<00:01:43.860> a

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
out onto my onto my heatsink with a

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.069 
out onto my onto my heatsink with a
sharpie<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.490> then<00:01:44.579> I'm<00:01:45.450> going<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.659> actually

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
sharpie and then I'm going to actually

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.069 
sharpie and then I'm going to actually
paste<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.590> LEDs<00:01:47.039> on<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:48.299> here<00:01:48.719> with<00:01:48.930> the

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
paste the LEDs on to here with the

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.520 
paste the LEDs on to here with the
adhesive<00:01:49.590> that<00:01:49.950> I<00:01:50.039> got<00:01:50.280> from<00:01:50.430> Rapid<00:01:50.880> LED

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
adhesive that I got from Rapid LED

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.679 
adhesive that I got from Rapid LED
before<00:01:52.530> we<00:01:52.680> do<00:01:52.859> all<00:01:53.039> that<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.670> want<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.539> make

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
before we do all that I want to make

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.870 
before we do all that I want to make
sure<00:01:54.719> that<00:01:55.109> the<00:01:55.350> panel's<00:01:56.189> are<00:01:56.310> clean<00:01:56.579> so<00:01:56.609> I'm

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
sure that the panel's are clean so I'm

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.520 
sure that the panel's are clean so I'm
going<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.090> take<00:01:57.299> some<00:01:57.479> rubbing<00:01:57.840> alcohol<00:01:57.990> and

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
going to take some rubbing alcohol and

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.010 
going to take some rubbing alcohol and
I'm<00:01:58.920> going<00:01:59.100> to<00:01:59.130> clean<00:01:59.369> these<00:01:59.579> off<00:01:59.869> make<00:02:00.869> sure

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
I'm going to clean these off make sure

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.760 
I'm going to clean these off make sure
that<00:02:01.200> they're<00:02:01.409> all<00:02:01.439> nice<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:02.009> tidy<00:02:02.420> okay

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
that they're all nice and tidy okay

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.309 
that they're all nice and tidy okay
let's<00:02:04.770> just<00:02:05.070> pause<00:02:05.340> here<00:02:05.609> for<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.880> second

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:21.209 
ready to connect the LEDs to now I would
have<00:02:19.389> liked<00:02:19.599> to<00:02:19.719> done<00:02:20.079> some<00:02:20.319> grilling<00:02:20.739> tapping

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:21.219

stuff like that I know rapid LED does
carry<00:02:40.510> them<00:02:40.719> now<00:02:40.900> but<00:02:41.230> like<00:02:41.769> I<00:02:41.919> said<00:02:42.129> in<00:02:42.310> my

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
carry them now but like I said in my

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.909 
carry them now but like I said in my
first<00:02:42.669> part<00:02:43.180> there<00:02:43.389> I<00:02:43.569> was<00:02:44.109> I<00:02:44.379> ordered<00:02:44.859> them

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:44.919 
first part there I was I ordered them

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:47.129 
first part there I was I ordered them
too<00:02:45.159> soon<00:02:45.370> to<00:02:45.579> get<00:02:45.700> that<00:02:45.909> feature<00:02:46.150> so<00:02:46.540> what<00:02:47.109> I

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:47.139 
too soon to get that feature so what I

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:49.170 
too soon to get that feature so what I
do<00:02:47.260> have<00:02:47.650> is<00:02:47.680> I've<00:02:48.189> got<00:02:48.400> this<00:02:48.579> thermal

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
do have is I've got this thermal

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.559 
do have is I've got this thermal
adhesive<00:02:49.500> now<00:02:50.500> I'm<00:02:50.620> not<00:02:50.769> too<00:02:50.980> worried<00:02:51.280> because

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
adhesive now I'm not too worried because

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.209 
adhesive now I'm not too worried because
I've<00:02:52.569> got<00:02:52.840> pretty<00:02:53.049> big<00:02:53.260> heat<00:02:53.530> sinks<00:02:53.949> for<00:02:54.129> the

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:54.219 
I've got pretty big heat sinks for the

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:56.309 
I've got pretty big heat sinks for the
amount<00:02:54.430> of<00:02:54.489> LEDs<00:02:54.909> going<00:02:55.269> on<00:02:55.389> each<00:02:55.569> heatsink<00:02:56.169> so

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
amount of LEDs going on each heatsink so

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:57.750 
amount of LEDs going on each heatsink so
if<00:02:56.469> one<00:02:56.650> of<00:02:56.769> them<00:02:56.859> burns<00:02:57.159> out<00:02:57.400> for<00:02:57.609> whatever

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
if one of them burns out for whatever

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.240 
if one of them burns out for whatever
reason<00:02:58.269> it<00:02:58.419> gets<00:02:58.750> damaged<00:02:59.290> I<00:02:59.439> have<00:03:00.010> enough

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
reason it gets damaged I have enough

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:01.920 
reason it gets damaged I have enough
room<00:03:00.430> to<00:03:00.459> remove<00:03:00.760> it<00:03:01.120> and<00:03:01.269> put<00:03:01.480> a<00:03:01.540> new<00:03:01.719> one<00:03:01.870> on

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
room to remove it and put a new one on

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.319 
room to remove it and put a new one on
right<00:03:02.319> beside<00:03:02.709> it<00:03:02.919> not<00:03:03.400> too<00:03:03.639> big<00:03:03.849> of<00:03:03.879> a<00:03:04.060> deal

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:04.329 
right beside it not too big of a deal

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:06.839 
right beside it not too big of a deal
and<00:03:05.230> of<00:03:05.379> course<00:03:05.620> Kim<00:03:05.829> comes<00:03:06.280> to<00:03:06.459> worst<00:03:06.609> I<00:03:06.790> can

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
and of course Kim comes to worst I can

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:08.399 
and of course Kim comes to worst I can
always<00:03:07.120> end<00:03:07.419> up<00:03:07.510> getting<00:03:07.810> a<00:03:07.930> whole<00:03:08.139> nother

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:08.409 
always end up getting a whole nother

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:10.289 
always end up getting a whole nother
heat<00:03:08.680> sinks<00:03:09.069> work<00:03:09.219> I<00:03:09.489> don't<00:03:09.879> have<00:03:10.000> to<00:03:10.150> buy

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
heat sinks work I don't have to buy

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:12.209 
heat sinks work I don't have to buy
another<00:03:10.599> driver<00:03:10.900> just<00:03:11.260> the<00:03:11.349> LEDs<00:03:11.769> and<00:03:11.980> the<00:03:12.069> new

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:12.219 
another driver just the LEDs and the new

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:14.670 
another driver just the LEDs and the new
heatsink<00:03:13.049> not<00:03:14.049> a<00:03:14.079> big<00:03:14.319> deal

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
heatsink not a big deal

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.800 
heatsink not a big deal
figure<00:03:15.069> that<00:03:15.189> out<00:03:15.430> as<00:03:15.549> times<00:03:15.790> as<00:03:15.970> long<00:03:16.120> but<00:03:16.419> so

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
figure that out as times as long but so

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.289 
figure that out as times as long but so
for<00:03:17.019> now<00:03:17.139> I'm<00:03:17.290> using<00:03:17.349> this<00:03:17.799> this<00:03:18.549> adhesive<00:03:18.909> but

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
for now I'm using this this adhesive but

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:20.670 
for now I'm using this this adhesive but
if<00:03:19.419> you're<00:03:19.540> doing<00:03:19.720> the<00:03:19.870> project<00:03:20.290> I<00:03:20.379> highly

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
if you're doing the project I highly

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.309 
if you're doing the project I highly
suggest<00:03:20.859> going<00:03:21.250> with<00:03:21.400> a<00:03:21.629> screwed<00:03:22.629> in<00:03:22.780> LED

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:23.319 
suggest going with a screwed in LED

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.300 
suggest going with a screwed in LED
system<00:03:23.739> because<00:03:24.099> it<00:03:24.729> just<00:03:24.939> gives<00:03:25.180> you<00:03:25.299> more

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
system because it just gives you more

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.990 
system because it just gives you more
more<00:03:27.310> expandability<00:03:29.310> so<00:03:30.310> I'm<00:03:30.430> using<00:03:30.609> a<00:03:30.790> piece

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
more expandability so I'm using a piece

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.140 
more expandability so I'm using a piece
of<00:03:31.180> aluminum<00:03:31.629> foil<00:03:31.930> to<00:03:32.829> mix<00:03:33.040> my<00:03:33.250> tea<00:03:33.310> Sivan<00:03:33.879> and

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
of aluminum foil to mix my tea Sivan and

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.780 
of aluminum foil to mix my tea Sivan and
the<00:03:34.329> instructions<00:03:34.840> are<00:03:35.049> it's<00:03:35.319> one<00:03:36.310> part<00:03:36.609> from

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
the instructions are it's one part from

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.999 
the instructions are it's one part from
one<00:03:37.060> tube<00:03:37.359> to<00:03:37.840> one<00:03:37.989> part<00:03:38.290> from<00:03:38.439> the<00:03:38.620> other<00:03:38.739> to

00:03:38.999 --> 00:03:39.009 
one tube to one part from the other to

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:41.520 
one tube to one part from the other to
mix<00:03:39.699> it<00:03:39.849> with<00:03:39.939> a<00:03:39.970> little<00:03:40.180> spatula<00:03:40.540> spoon<00:03:41.139> Shila

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
mix it with a little spatula spoon Shila

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.469 
mix it with a little spatula spoon Shila
thing<00:03:41.739> they<00:03:41.889> give<00:03:42.099> you<00:03:42.220> there<00:03:42.400> put<00:03:43.030> it<00:03:43.180> on<00:03:43.329> the

00:03:43.469 --> 00:03:43.479 
thing they give you there put it on the

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:46.259 
thing they give you there put it on the
back<00:03:43.629> of<00:03:43.810> the<00:03:43.900> LED<00:03:44.349> pop<00:03:45.099> it<00:03:45.280> into<00:03:45.430> place<00:03:45.519> hold

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
back of the LED pop it into place hold

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:49.499 
back of the LED pop it into place hold
it<00:03:46.479> down<00:03:47.400> they<00:03:48.400> stay<00:03:48.579> clamp<00:03:48.879> it<00:03:49.060> down<00:03:49.090> but<00:03:49.419> I

00:03:49.499 --> 00:03:49.509 
it down they stay clamp it down but I

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:52.080 
it down they stay clamp it down but I
don't<00:03:50.079> have<00:03:50.229> enough<00:03:50.439> clamps<00:03:50.949> to<00:03:51.189> do<00:03:51.849> all<00:03:52.060> of

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
don't have enough clamps to do all of

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.270 
don't have enough clamps to do all of
these<00:03:52.389> obviously<00:03:53.169> so<00:03:53.439> I'm<00:03:53.949> just<00:03:54.069> going<00:03:54.189> to

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
these obviously so I'm just going to

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.559 
these obviously so I'm just going to
hold<00:03:54.459> them<00:03:54.579> down<00:03:54.609> for<00:03:54.939> a<00:03:54.969> few<00:03:55.120> seconds

just<00:05:45.979> like<00:05:46.190> in<00:05:46.400> elementary<00:05:47.120> school<00:05:47.810> with<00:05:47.960> the

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:48.080 
just like in elementary school with the

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.350 
just like in elementary school with the
old<00:05:48.229> glue<00:05:48.500> stick<00:05:48.800> making<00:05:49.099> shapes<00:05:49.820> and<00:05:50.120> putting

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:50.360 
old glue stick making shapes and putting

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.149 
old glue stick making shapes and putting
them<00:05:50.479> on<00:05:50.570> a<00:05:50.630> piece<00:05:50.900> of<00:05:50.930> paper<00:05:51.229> so<00:05:51.860> I'm<00:05:51.949> going<00:05:52.130> to

00:05:52.149 --> 00:05:52.159 
them on a piece of paper so I'm going to

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:53.920 
them on a piece of paper so I'm going to
paste<00:05:52.370> them<00:05:52.550> down<00:05:52.729> and<00:05:52.970> I'll<00:05:53.479> show<00:05:53.659> you<00:05:53.720> what

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:53.930 
paste them down and I'll show you what

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.480 
paste them down and I'll show you what
it<00:05:54.020> looks<00:05:54.199> like<00:05:54.349> afterwards<00:05:54.740> and<00:05:55.070> talk<00:05:55.220> about

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:55.490 
it looks like afterwards and talk about

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:57.580 
it looks like afterwards and talk about
any<00:05:55.639> problems<00:05:56.090> if<00:05:56.210> I<00:05:56.330> have<00:05:56.509> alright<00:05:57.289> one

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:57.590 
any problems if I have alright one

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:01.089 
any problems if I have alright one
second<00:05:59.080> okay<00:06:00.080> for<00:06:00.289> those<00:06:00.380> of<00:06:00.470> you<00:06:00.680> using<00:06:00.979> the

00:06:01.089 --> 00:06:01.099 
second okay for those of you using the

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:02.589 
second okay for those of you using the
thermal<00:06:01.460> paste<00:06:01.699> I'm<00:06:01.880> going<00:06:02.030> to<00:06:02.090> quickly<00:06:02.270> show

00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:02.599 
thermal paste I'm going to quickly show

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:05.620 
thermal paste I'm going to quickly show
you<00:06:02.630> how<00:06:02.780> to<00:06:02.930> mix<00:06:03.710> this<00:06:03.940> best<00:06:04.940> way<00:06:05.090> to<00:06:05.120> do<00:06:05.360> is

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:05.630 
you how to mix this best way to do is

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:10.210 
you how to mix this best way to do is
little<00:06:06.110> tiny<00:06:06.620> gloves<00:06:08.710> you<00:06:09.710> can<00:06:09.770> kind<00:06:10.130> of

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:10.220 
little tiny gloves you can kind of

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:14.480 
little tiny gloves you can kind of
measure<00:06:10.430> out<00:06:10.669> your<00:06:10.699> gloves

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:22.140 

by<00:06:15.490> putting<00:06:15.910> them<00:06:16.150> side-by-side<00:06:21.000> once<00:06:22.000> you've

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:22.150 
by putting them side-by-side once you've

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.200 
by putting them side-by-side once you've
got<00:06:22.360> your<00:06:22.390> two<00:06:22.720> almost<00:06:23.320> identical<00:06:23.560> globs<00:06:24.280> take

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:25.210 
got your two almost identical globs take

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:29.760 
got your two almost identical globs take
your<00:06:25.390> syringes<00:06:25.990> of<00:06:26.820> paste<00:06:27.820> and<00:06:28.650> kind<00:06:29.650> of

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:29.770 
your syringes of paste and kind of

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:32.280 
your syringes of paste and kind of
measure<00:06:30.040> where<00:06:30.460> these<00:06:30.670> two<00:06:31.300> bottom<00:06:31.810> parts<00:06:32.110> are

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:32.290 
measure where these two bottom parts are

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:34.320 
measure where these two bottom parts are
like<00:06:32.800> they're<00:06:33.220> identical<00:06:33.670> then<00:06:34.030> you<00:06:34.180> know

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:34.330 
like they're identical then you know

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.260 
like they're identical then you know
that<00:06:34.510> you're<00:06:34.660> still<00:06:34.870> spot-on

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:36.270 
that you're still spot-on

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.870 
that you're still spot-on
reason<00:06:37.270> why<00:06:37.360> I<00:06:37.420> only<00:06:37.630> do<00:06:38.310> sorry<00:06:39.310> it's<00:06:39.790> a<00:06:39.850> little

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:39.880 
reason why I only do sorry it's a little

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:42.150 
reason why I only do sorry it's a little
bit<00:06:40.240> at<00:06:40.420> a<00:06:40.510> time<00:06:40.570> is<00:06:41.080> because<00:06:41.440> the<00:06:41.590> stuff<00:06:41.890> dries

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:42.160 
bit at a time is because the stuff dries

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.430 
bit at a time is because the stuff dries
up<00:06:42.370> pretty<00:06:42.610> quick<00:06:42.850> and<00:06:42.970> if<00:06:43.060> you<00:06:43.150> use<00:06:43.240> a<00:06:43.270> lot<00:06:43.570> you

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:44.440 
up pretty quick and if you use a lot you

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.330 
up pretty quick and if you use a lot you
waste<00:06:44.680> it<00:06:45.030> mix<00:06:46.030> it<00:06:46.210> up<00:06:46.360> from<00:06:47.230> the<00:06:47.380> bombing<00:06:47.590> led

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:48.340 
waste it mix it up from the bombing led

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.120 
waste it mix it up from the bombing led
stick<00:06:49.270> it<00:06:49.419> on<00:06:49.600> push<00:06:50.260> it<00:06:50.440> down<00:06:50.650> a<00:06:50.680> little<00:06:50.950> bit

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:51.130 
stick it on push it down a little bit

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:53.190 
stick it on push it down a little bit
wiggle<00:06:51.460> it<00:06:51.700> that's<00:06:51.880> it<00:06:52.419> move<00:06:52.660> on<00:06:52.840> to<00:06:52.990> the<00:06:53.080> next

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:53.200 
wiggle it that's it move on to the next

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.080 
wiggle it that's it move on to the next
one<00:06:53.500> and<00:06:54.160> that's<00:06:54.280> it<00:06:54.490> that's<00:06:54.610> how<00:06:54.760> you<00:06:54.790> use<00:06:54.970> the

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:55.090 
one and that's it that's how you use the

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:57.270 
one and that's it that's how you use the
thermal<00:06:55.330> pace<00:06:55.660> like<00:06:56.500> I<00:06:56.620> said<00:06:56.800> before<00:06:56.950> if<00:06:57.190> you

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:57.280 
thermal pace like I said before if you

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.130 
thermal pace like I said before if you
can<00:06:57.520> go<00:06:58.210> with<00:06:58.360> the<00:06:58.480> drill

00:06:59.130 --> 00:06:59.140 
can go with the drill

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:02.520 
can go with the drill
heat<00:06:59.590> sink<00:07:00.540> all<00:07:01.540> right<00:07:01.780> there<00:07:01.990> we<00:07:02.140> go<00:07:02.169> all<00:07:02.500> the

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:02.530 
heat sink all right there we go all the

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:06.270 
heat sink all right there we go all the
LEDs<00:07:03.100> are<00:07:03.340> secured<00:07:03.760> to<00:07:03.940> their<00:07:04.180> heat<00:07:04.419> sinks<00:07:05.280> it

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:06.280 
LEDs are secured to their heat sinks it

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.370 
LEDs are secured to their heat sinks it
was<00:07:06.460> a<00:07:06.490> lot<00:07:06.850> easier<00:07:07.120> put<00:07:07.720> these<00:07:07.900> ones<00:07:08.110> on

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:08.380 
was a lot easier put these ones on

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:10.200 
was a lot easier put these ones on
without<00:07:08.680> the<00:07:08.800> wires<00:07:09.040> attached<00:07:09.550> so<00:07:09.760> I<00:07:09.820> highly

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:10.210 
without the wires attached so I highly

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:12.240 
without the wires attached so I highly
suggest<00:07:10.419> do<00:07:10.810> that<00:07:11.020> but<00:07:11.560> if<00:07:11.710> you're<00:07:11.860> going<00:07:12.130> to

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:12.250 
suggest do that but if you're going to

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:15.180 
suggest do that but if you're going to
do<00:07:12.640> that<00:07:12.970> make<00:07:13.390> sure<00:07:13.690> you<00:07:13.930> tend<00:07:14.380> your<00:07:14.590> plus<00:07:14.950> and

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:15.190 
do that make sure you tend your plus and

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:18.090 
do that make sure you tend your plus and
minus<00:07:15.520> connection<00:07:16.030> pads<00:07:16.300> before<00:07:16.630> you<00:07:17.290> attach

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:18.100 
minus connection pads before you attach

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:19.890 
minus connection pads before you attach
them<00:07:18.310> to<00:07:18.460> a<00:07:18.520> heat<00:07:18.790> sink<00:07:19.150> you<00:07:19.300> can<00:07:19.360> try<00:07:19.630> to<00:07:19.690> do

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:19.900 
them to a heat sink you can try to do

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.900 
them to a heat sink you can try to do
that<00:07:20.080> afterwards<00:07:20.470> it's<00:07:21.190> going<00:07:21.340> to<00:07:21.400> be<00:07:21.550> really

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:21.910 
that afterwards it's going to be really

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:23.520 
that afterwards it's going to be really
hard<00:07:22.120> to<00:07:22.180> make<00:07:22.450> your<00:07:22.600> connections<00:07:23.140> that<00:07:23.290> later

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:23.530 
hard to make your connections that later

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:25.469 
hard to make your connections that later
on<00:07:23.620> with<00:07:23.950> your<00:07:24.070> wire<00:07:24.310> it's<00:07:25.210> going<00:07:25.330> to<00:07:25.419> be

00:07:25.469 --> 00:07:25.479 
on with your wire it's going to be

00:07:25.479 --> 00:07:27.540 
on with your wire it's going to be
really<00:07:25.750> hard<00:07:25.900> to<00:07:26.080> get<00:07:26.229> those<00:07:26.440> pads<00:07:26.890> soldered

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:27.550 
really hard to get those pads soldered

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:29.340 
really hard to get those pads soldered
and<00:07:27.700> tend<00:07:28.000> on<00:07:28.270> there<00:07:28.660> to<00:07:28.990> make<00:07:29.140> your

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:29.350 
and tend on there to make your

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:31.380 
and tend on there to make your
connections<00:07:29.890> so<00:07:30.490> yeah<00:07:30.669> if<00:07:30.880> you're<00:07:31.000> gonna<00:07:31.150> do

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:31.390 
connections so yeah if you're gonna do

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:34.140 
connections so yeah if you're gonna do
that<00:07:31.600> ten<00:07:32.290> your<00:07:32.650> LEDs<00:07:33.250> before<00:07:33.729> you<00:07:33.820> connect

00:07:34.140 --> 00:07:34.150 
that ten your LEDs before you connect

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:37.440 
that ten your LEDs before you connect
them<00:07:34.270> to<00:07:34.450> the<00:07:34.630> food<00:07:35.350> stinks<00:07:35.850> anyway<00:07:36.850> that's

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:37.450 
them to the food stinks anyway that's

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:39.900 
them to the food stinks anyway that's
that<00:07:37.750> and<00:07:38.050> the<00:07:38.350> part<00:07:38.650> to<00:07:38.950> come<00:07:39.370> back<00:07:39.580> later

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:39.910 
that and the part to come back later

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:41.640 
that and the part to come back later
part<00:07:40.240> three<00:07:40.510> and<00:07:40.720> I'll<00:07:40.840> show<00:07:41.080> you<00:07:41.110> how<00:07:41.320> to<00:07:41.350> wire

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:41.650 
part three and I'll show you how to wire
