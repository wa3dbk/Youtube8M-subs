there's a relationship because of the
Sun<00:00:44.149> typically<00:00:45.149> it'll<00:00:45.390> use<00:00:45.960> some<00:00:46.200> of<00:00:46.320> its

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
Sun typically it'll use some of its

Sun typically it'll use some of its
energy<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:47.160> evaporate<00:00:47.370> some<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.420> that

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
energy to evaporate some of that

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
plants Julie all of that energy goes

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.389 
plants Julie all of that energy goes
directly<00:00:54.329> into<00:00:54.690> heating<00:00:55.260> up<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.829> atmosphere

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
directly into heating up the atmosphere

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.880 
the line but we will continue to monitor
and<00:03:38.610> check<00:03:38.640> and<00:03:39.540> you<00:03:39.989> know<00:03:40.110> it<00:03:40.380> started<00:03:40.739> off

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
and check and you know it started off

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.190 
and check and you know it started off
really<00:03:41.610> out<00:03:41.790> of<00:03:41.820> the<00:03:42.030> gate<00:03:42.209> a<00:03:42.239> very<00:03:42.750> active

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
really out of the gate a very active

with Alberto beryl Chris Debbie now a

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.620 
with Alberto beryl Chris Debbie now a
little<00:03:46.590> bit<00:03:46.799> of<00:03:46.980> a<00:03:47.070> lull<00:03:47.310> but<00:03:47.670> if<00:03:47.940> you<00:03:48.390> consider

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
little bit of a lull but if you consider

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.460 
little bit of a lull but if you consider
the<00:03:49.080> season<00:03:50.040> things<00:03:51.000> tend<00:03:51.480> to<00:03:51.630> be<00:03:51.750> very<00:03:52.080> slow

in<00:03:52.890> July<00:03:53.459> and<00:03:53.790> then<00:03:53.970> they<00:03:54.150> really<00:03:54.540> ramped<00:03:54.810> up

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
in July and then they really ramped up

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:57.620 
in July and then they really ramped up
once<00:03:55.709> we<00:03:55.799> get<00:03:55.980> into<00:03:56.250> August<00:03:56.430> in<00:03:56.820> September<00:03:57.359> so
