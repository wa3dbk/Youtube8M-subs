this<00:02:14.150> way<00:02:14.329> the<00:02:15.260> weight<00:02:15.440> oh<00:02:15.829> the<00:02:16.400> weight<00:02:16.610> is<00:02:16.850> I

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
this way the weight oh the weight is I

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.610 
this way the weight oh the weight is I
think<00:02:18.340> 639<00:02:19.340> grams

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
think 639 grams

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.259 
think 639 grams
so<00:02:20.769> a<00:02:20.799> little<00:02:21.069> bit<00:02:21.280> lighter<00:02:21.670> than<00:02:21.970> the

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
so a little bit lighter than the

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:24.899 
so a little bit lighter than the
original<00:02:22.870> iPad<00:02:23.200> and<00:02:23.670> definitely<00:02:24.670> lighter

than<00:02:25.629> the<00:02:25.810> zoom<00:02:26.430> absolutely<00:02:27.430> I<00:02:27.459> think<00:02:28.000> that<00:02:28.480> a

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
than the zoom absolutely I think that a

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.750 
than the zoom absolutely I think that a
lot<00:02:28.629> of<00:02:28.840> that<00:02:29.110> is<00:02:29.290> the<00:02:29.470> fact<00:02:29.739> that<00:02:29.890> it's<00:02:30.099> an<00:02:30.220> 8.9

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
lot of that is the fact that it's an 8.9

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.750
