00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
hanging on the streets and stuff like

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.400 
hanging on the streets and stuff like
that<00:00:43.879> anyway<00:00:44.879> you<00:00:45.539> know<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.809> cops<00:00:46.079> were<00:00:46.350> there

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
that anyway you know the cops were there

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.529 
that anyway you know the cops were there
you<00:00:46.860> know<00:00:46.920> they<00:00:47.070> were<00:00:47.160> like<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:47.610> think<00:00:48.329> one

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
you know they were like I think one

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.860 
you know they were like I think one
block<00:00:48.750> down<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.050> street<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.860> I<00:00:50.660> guess<00:00:51.660> if

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
block down the street and I guess if

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.139 
block down the street and I guess if
they<00:00:52.170> just<00:00:52.469> didn't<00:00:52.920> go<00:00:53.039> past<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.520> cops<00:00:53.760> didn't

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
they just didn't go past the cops didn't

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.090 
they just didn't go past the cops didn't
get<00:00:54.300> in<00:00:54.390> trouble<00:00:54.539> but<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.379> cops<00:00:55.590> don't<00:00:55.710> go<00:00:56.010> out

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
get in trouble but the cops don't go out

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.040 
get in trouble but the cops don't go out
there<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.340> try<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.579> break<00:00:56.760> break<00:00:57.570> them<00:00:57.780> up<00:00:57.930> I

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
there and try to break break them up I

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.260 
there and try to break break them up I
guess<00:00:58.320> because<00:00:59.160> you<00:00:59.460> know<00:00:59.609> they're<00:00:59.850> just<00:01:00.030> out

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
guess because you know they're just out

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.959 
guess because you know they're just out
enjoying<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:01.050> know<00:01:01.079> it's<00:01:01.289> nothing<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.680> do<00:01:01.969> you
