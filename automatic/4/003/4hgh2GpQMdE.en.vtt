00:00:00.799 --> 00:00:01.890
 hello dear 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.029
 users are you watching the third lesson 

00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:05.109
 on working with the program 

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:06.809
 extruders dedicated profiles and 

00:00:06.809 --> 00:00:08.249
 site optimization 

00:00:08.249 --> 00:00:10.019
 our program is represented by two 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.099
 models 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.789
 she's a forest site morphology and structure 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:15.309
 the site 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:17.349
 in fact, I rarely find a site 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:19.480
 which lead is not any 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.009
 serious mistakes and flaws 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:24.139
 and this leads to the fact that the site for example 

00:00:24.139 --> 00:00:25.829
 poorly indexed 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:27.829
 occupy bad positions and in general 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:30.189
 hard flowing so try 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:33.620
 fix the found program errors 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.610
 start with Latin optimization or 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.650
 morphological analysis site 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.150
 go step 4 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.150
 and we start the sender hell 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.410
 program determine key density 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.490
 words for each important 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.450
 for search engines td site 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.070
 I will tell briefly 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.110
 about whom waited from these 5 hectares 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.570
 rector of this 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.930
 the most important part of the page 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.170
 having 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.080
 greatest and opposition errors site of such 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.430
 promoted query 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.140
 art and this you can see the run 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.600
 in the right sera tabs 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.190
 when the site is open 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.190
 and odd whales when japanese 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.500
 in search engines 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.280
 so this one should not only be 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.100
 well optimized but also attractive 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.010
 for visitors because looking at 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.540
 headline 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.890
 visitors decides go to the site or 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.730
 not 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:42.950
 five twos 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.910
 determines the visible part of the document 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.090
 in this section are all 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.540
 the content of the document Kiev 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.720
 photography articles 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.720
 form to fill and other objects 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.610
 such relationship 6 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.490
 serving for captions and giving 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.860
 weight words 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.160
 search engine perceive and this 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.710
 money and steps 6 as the most important words 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:10.849
 in the text 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:13.849
 but do not build use have no 

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:16.259
 the text should be he 

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:19.259
 succinctly built 

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:21.399
 t and clinics 

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:23.659
 on any page necessarily there 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:25.499
 links pointing to other pages 

00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:28.389
 the search engine analyzes them at 3 5 

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:30.179
 broadcasting keywords 

00:02:30.179 --> 00:02:32.199
 so determine how much the page 

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:35.199
 relevant keyword 

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:37.129
 Craig Prime Tass 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:39.450
 or alternative text represents 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.319
 a textual description of the mixed 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.079
 Pictures 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.819
 if for some reason it has not opened 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:48.819
 the browser 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.579
 the text ron kirk is for 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:53.819
 highlighting important words in bold text 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:55.930
 font in order to attract a special 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.930
 reader attention to the highlighted word 

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:03.319
 our task is to density 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:05.389
 key phrases for this purpose 

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:08.129
 was just such that the site was that 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:09.249
 such to be 

00:03:09.249 --> 00:03:11.769
 specific request for you for this and 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:14.519
 this tool is intended 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:17.090
 the program will show us how many times each 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.790
 the key phrase is found on 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:19.779
 page 

00:03:19.779 --> 00:03:21.600
 for example the phrase mailing 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.909
 on the bulletin board 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:28.229
 I do not meet 

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:29.669
 credit and this 

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:32.669
 it shows the current figure 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:35.109
 percent 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:38.109
 average 

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:40.659
 competitors 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:43.259
 about 1 25 

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:45.479
 therefore, the program recommends 

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:46.290
 kulichki 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.290
 keyword density 

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:53.229
 Thaws there is a tradition of one dollars 

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:56.879
 in general in order to achieve the perfect 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:58.009
 density 

00:03:58.009 --> 00:04:01.039
 just repeat the competition for foot 

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:03.929
 by the way to see the list km 

00:04:03.929 --> 00:04:06.479
 competitors just click on the pressure
