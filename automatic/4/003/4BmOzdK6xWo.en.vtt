00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:10.139
 the service people askari today I show 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.820
 a very interesting app for everyone 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.240
 the always too little memory on 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.890
 her ipad or iphone took you can 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.890
 your data your media content music 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.900
 Pictures and videos also quite simply yours 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.220
 network disk and put there 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.020
 It's a nice app media that easy 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.289
 could play the app is called 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.990
 adebayor is the app up here 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:32.489
 it costs in the app store costs 4 euro 99 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.980
 and is really worth every cent of me 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.350
 Show you the reason why I do that 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.050
 currently from movies and screen capture is 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.499
 relatively simply inexplicably short i 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.760
 I have the ipad standing here in the end 

00:00:42.499 --> 00:00:46.469
 and this reflects is also nice here 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.670
 on the imac so that's me actually 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.190
 screen capture and wind around you 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.449
 Show without me just blurred 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.769
 camera off what, by the way, we are not 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:58.530
 But the problem is when I'm here 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:59.879
 open strawberry app then you see 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.079
 already then it suddenly becomes that media 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.539
 Window reduces that means I can 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.930
 Do not show me like me at the 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.030
 selection before gc and that's nice so 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.830
 nice so I film you that here 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.600
 even if it's a bit worse 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.970
 the quality is forgive me 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.990
 but hopefully I have no other 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.520
 technical solution found 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:23.060
 we conclude once the app 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:26.280
 complete and start the app now 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.470
 so the home screen is actually 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.020
 everything relatively easy you have cold 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.290
 here is the selection of music movies or 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.820
 pictures in the case i have for each 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.720
 all test folder prepared I start 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.080
 sometimes with music 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.420
 I click on music now I can 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.520
 here practically already things locally 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.310
 the device put or I attack here 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.080
 my my book live tonky server to that 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.240
 is roads i only have network 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.920
 hard disk of western digital the 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.810
 supports this mainburg this 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.220
 this tanguy server standard what 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.400
 actually all network hard drives 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.680
 nowadays i push on it then i have 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:05.370
 access to music photos still videos 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.440
 once divided music so now 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.390
 i can say i want all tracks 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.450
 I like the ones on the plate 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.650
 to 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:16.489
 what is the name of the interpret and so on 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:19.120
 then, of course, also after folder 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:21.590
 Here's the easiest way I think 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.400
 and I've prepared that and that's her 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.489
 test folder 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.860
 I do not want to get hurt here 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:31.220
 beginning presents podcast that is from 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.840
 me and of great times I have before one 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.540
 couple of years added the schwetzinger 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:39.349
 this can also be true of resident evil 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:41.510
 for a long time merck will emphasize 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:44.120
 turned off but it is running in the 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.980
 principle can also be in the piece of music 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.269
 you can just play the 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.590
 advantages is it does not stop 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.959
 an ipad else is one 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:55.340
 network hard drive so there we go 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:03:00.349
 back all the way back the same 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:02.810
 with photos also here at full so after 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:04.280
 folders sorted which has since been the 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.569
 whole folder I on the 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.549
 network hard drive off and also here 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:13.280
 I created a test folder somewhere 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:15.950
 with a nice picture of the linux pinguin 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.359
 it will be just the extreme 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.680
 but it will be here 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:20.989
 It will only happen if I am here now 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.980
 no reflectors would have been at the start 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.109
 of course on the display 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.849
 there is currently only a blake 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:30.950
 Streams because I stop the reflectors 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:32.299
 did so against it back or 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.099
 rather, I'll show you this me 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:37.720
 I 'll do this here 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:40.310
 reflector app is supposed to be off already 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:43.209
 should already work properly 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:46.190
 here he is then on display so 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:48.410
 go back and do the same with me 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.030
 videos that of course the most interesting 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.099
 because I like my music and where the pony 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.169
 are really a lot of memory but at 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:55.700
 videos of course extremely interesting because 

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:57.950
 you can just do your whole movie that 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.260
 network hard disk outsource 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:03.349
 there is a two three four terabyte 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.500
 actually no problem and no problem 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:08.599
 can easily retrieve with an ipad 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.370
 that's all the most interesting and there 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:13.090
 I already prepared something and 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:17.109
 Although a video that is of myself 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:20.829
 Of course no one either with that 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:20.829
 traces of pieces 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:26.620
 exactly and there is the video directly from 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.610
 a network hard drive on my ipad 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.830
 and I need to look now 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.470
 as often as I want when I want 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:37.130
 without me on the ipad memory 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:40.580
 So consume and player app store 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:42.639
 really highly recommended is extreme 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.479
 easy to use you do not have to 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:46.370
 I have great attitude 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:48.110
 no settings actually finds 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.820
 immediately the network hard disk we can 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.370
 can start immediately to all 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:55.610
 All euro countries can access 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:57.320
 simply play media content and so on 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.830
 it's not much better 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.870
 recommend 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.169
 In this sense, it makes good in the 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.169
 oscar
