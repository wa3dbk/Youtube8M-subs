00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:49.050 
drop your dragons in a line like you
always<00:05:46.629> do<00:05:46.870> no<00:05:47.529> really<00:05:47.949> you<00:05:48.520> want<00:05:48.729> to<00:05:48.819> know<00:05:48.879> how

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.060 
always do no really you want to know how

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:50.640 
always do no really you want to know how
he's<00:05:49.210> coming<00:05:49.509> in<00:05:49.599> on<00:05:49.689> this<00:05:49.839> with<00:05:50.020> the<00:05:50.259> rage

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:50.650 
he's coming in on this with the rage

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:51.959 
he's coming in on this with the rage
spells<00:05:50.949> and<00:05:51.099> I<00:05:51.159> figured<00:05:51.430> dropping<00:05:51.819> more

00:05:51.959 --> 00:05:51.969 
spells and I figured dropping more

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:53.969 
spells and I figured dropping more
towards<00:05:52.300> the<00:05:52.389> two<00:05:52.659> air<00:05:52.870> defenses<00:05:53.289> here<00:05:53.529> drop

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:53.979 
towards the two air defenses here drop

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:55.499 
towards the two air defenses here drop
two<00:05:54.159> rages<00:05:54.460> on<00:05:54.580> them<00:05:54.819> it'll<00:05:55.029> suck<00:05:55.360> your

00:05:55.499 --> 00:05:55.509 
two rages on them it'll suck your

00:05:55.509 --> 00:05:56.879 
two rages on them it'll suck your
dragons<00:05:55.900> right<00:05:56.080> into<00:05:56.349> the<00:05:56.469> center<00:05:56.650> of<00:05:56.770> the

00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:56.889 
dragons right into the center of the

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:58.409 
dragons right into the center of the
base<00:05:57.129> and<00:05:57.460> basically<00:05:57.849> they'll<00:05:58.089> be<00:05:58.180> able<00:05:58.270> to

00:05:58.409 --> 00:05:58.419 
base and basically they'll be able to

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:00.540 
base and basically they'll be able to
pop<00:05:58.659> out<00:05:58.870> those<00:05:59.110> air<00:05:59.560> defenses<00:05:59.979> relatively

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550 
pop out those air defenses relatively

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:02.189 
pop out those air defenses relatively
quickly<00:06:00.819> and<00:06:01.120> that's<00:06:01.419> what<00:06:01.539> they<00:06:01.629> do<00:06:01.839> the

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:02.199 
quickly and that's what they do the

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:04.050 
quickly and that's what they do the
loons<00:06:02.439> actually<00:06:02.830> go<00:06:02.919> straight<00:06:03.310> for<00:06:03.520> that<00:06:03.669> one

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:04.060 
loons actually go straight for that one

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:05.969 
loons actually go straight for that one
right<00:06:04.240> there<00:06:04.479> and<00:06:04.689> they<00:06:04.750> kill<00:06:05.080> it<00:06:05.229> very<00:06:05.770> very

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:05.979 
right there and they kill it very very

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:07.829 
right there and they kill it very very
quickly<00:06:06.189> the<00:06:06.729> second<00:06:07.120> one<00:06:07.210> goes<00:06:07.330> down<00:06:07.389> and<00:06:07.779> we

00:06:07.829 --> 00:06:07.839 
quickly the second one goes down and we

00:06:07.839 --> 00:06:09.420 
quickly the second one goes down and we
got<00:06:07.960> one<00:06:07.990> air<00:06:08.289> defense<00:06:08.620> that's<00:06:08.830> really<00:06:09.159> not

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:09.430 
got one air defense that's really not

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:11.040 
got one air defense that's really not
actually<00:06:10.240> it<00:06:10.330> is<00:06:10.449> on<00:06:10.629> them<00:06:10.810> it<00:06:10.900> was<00:06:11.020> not

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.050 
actually it is on them it was not

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:12.329 
actually it is on them it was not
supposed<00:06:11.500> to<00:06:11.620> be<00:06:11.710> on<00:06:11.740> him<00:06:11.949> when<00:06:12.039> he<00:06:12.099> was<00:06:12.219> on<00:06:12.310> the

00:06:12.329 --> 00:06:12.339 
supposed to be on him when he was on the

00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:13.709 
supposed to be on him when he was on the
Town<00:06:12.550> Hall<00:06:12.580> if<00:06:12.879> he<00:06:12.969> was<00:06:13.089> coming<00:06:13.120> in<00:06:13.419> from<00:06:13.569> this

00:06:13.709 --> 00:06:13.719 
Town Hall if he was coming in from this

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:16.950 
Town Hall if he was coming in from this
side<00:06:13.930> but<00:06:14.259> he<00:06:14.560> decided<00:06:14.919> that<00:06:15.509> that's<00:06:16.509> the<00:06:16.810> way

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:16.960 
side but he decided that that's the way

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.329 
side but he decided that that's the way
the<00:06:17.229> air<00:06:17.349> defense<00:06:17.620> that'll<00:06:17.949> work<00:06:18.069> that's

00:06:18.329 --> 00:06:18.339 
the air defense that'll work that's

00:06:18.339 --> 00:06:19.679 
the air defense that'll work that's
going<00:06:18.460> to<00:06:18.550> shoot<00:06:18.759> his<00:06:18.849> dragons<00:06:19.240> on<00:06:19.330> this<00:06:19.479> side

00:06:19.679 --> 00:06:19.689 
going to shoot his dragons on this side

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:22.260 
going to shoot his dragons on this side
and<00:06:19.900> they<00:06:20.710> do<00:06:20.770> end<00:06:21.039> up<00:06:21.129> still<00:06:21.430> popping<00:06:21.849> off<00:06:21.969> and

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:22.270 
and they do end up still popping off and

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:23.030 
and they do end up still popping off and
getting<00:06:22.449> into

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:23.040 
getting into

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.040

the air defense at that town hall is

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:26.420 
the air defense at that town hall is
kind<00:06:25.230> of<00:06:25.290> chilling<00:06:25.470> by<00:06:25.650> itself<00:06:25.980> saying<00:06:26.310> you
