top cap and the very top of the
cartomizer<00:00:27.769> and<00:00:28.769> what<00:00:29.010> you<00:00:29.130> want<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.369> do<00:00:29.460> is

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
cartomizer and what you want to do is

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.540 
cartomizer and what you want to do is
take<00:00:29.820> your<00:00:29.939> liquid<00:00:30.859> take<00:00:31.859> your<00:00:32.009> dripper<00:00:32.279> tip

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
take your liquid take your dripper tip

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.500 
take your liquid take your dripper tip
on<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:33.300> side<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:34.670> carefully<00:00:35.670> start<00:00:36.210> dripping

on the side and carefully start dripping

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.510 
on the side and carefully start dripping
the<00:00:36.690> liquid<00:00:36.989> in<00:00:37.140> make<00:00:37.350> sure<00:00:37.380> it's<00:00:37.739> going<00:00:37.980> into

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
the liquid in make sure it's going into

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.540 
the liquid in make sure it's going into
the<00:00:38.640> tank<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:39.210> not<00:00:39.390> into<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.899> cartomizer

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
the tank and not into the cartomizer

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.770 
the tank and not into the cartomizer
otherwise<00:00:41.550> you'll<00:00:41.850> wind<00:00:41.879> up<00:00:42.180> with<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.450> handful

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
otherwise you'll wind up with a handful

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.459 
otherwise you'll wind up with a handful
of<00:00:42.809> a<00:00:43.020> liquid<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:44.539> just<00:00:45.539> fill<00:00:45.809> this<00:00:45.989> tank<00:00:46.230> up

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
of a liquid and just fill this tank up

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.040 
of a liquid and just fill this tank up
until<00:00:46.829> it's<00:00:46.980> just<00:00:47.250> about<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.910> top<00:00:48.149> of<00:00:48.870> the

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
until it's just about to the top of the

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.069 
until it's just about to the top of the
Cardo<00:00:51.050> slide<00:00:52.050> it<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.350> back<00:00:52.530> up<00:00:53.960> through<00:00:54.960> the

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
Cardo slide it and back up through the

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.279 
Cardo slide it and back up through the
top<00:00:56.239> put<00:00:57.239> your<00:00:57.390> drip<00:00:57.570> tip<00:00:57.780> on<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.079> when<00:00:58.170> you're

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
top put your drip tip on and when you're

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.380 
top put your drip tip on and when you're
putting<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.530> drip<00:00:58.680> tip<00:00:58.829> on<00:00:59.010> hold<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.969> bottom

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
putting the drip tip on hold the bottom

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.660 
putting the drip tip on hold the bottom
of<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:01.379> cartomizer<00:01:01.680> so<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.129> doesn't<00:01:02.399> slide

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
of the cartomizer so it doesn't slide

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.539 
of the cartomizer so it doesn't slide
back<00:01:02.969> out<00:01:03.210> of<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.390> tank<00:01:04.010> now<00:01:05.010> what<00:01:05.220> you<00:01:05.309> got<00:01:05.460> to

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
back out of the tank now what you got to

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.480 
back out of the tank now what you got to
do<00:01:05.700> is<00:01:06.299> get<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.689> cartomizer<00:01:07.020> full<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:07.799> the

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
do is get the cartomizer full and the

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.830 
do is get the cartomizer full and the
way<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:08.640> can<00:01:08.850> do<00:01:08.939> this<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.330> just<00:01:09.540> put<00:01:09.720> your

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
way you can do this is just put your

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.250 
way you can do this is just put your
finger<00:01:10.170> over<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.409> end<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.700> Cardo<00:01:12.030> and

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
finger over the end of the Cardo and

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.399 
finger over the end of the Cardo and
you're<00:01:13.260> gonna<00:01:13.350> start<00:01:13.710> drawing<00:01:13.979> through<00:01:14.280> it

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:15.409 
you're gonna start drawing through it

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:18.859 
you're gonna start drawing through it
and<00:01:16.820> what<00:01:17.820> you'll<00:01:18.000> see<00:01:18.180> if<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.420> take<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.600> look

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
and what you'll see if you take a look

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.810 
and what you'll see if you take a look
at<00:01:18.960> it<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.110> few<00:01:19.259> times<00:01:19.409> there's<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.340> little<00:01:20.580> laser

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
at it a few times there's a little laser

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.429 
at it a few times there's a little laser
hole<00:01:21.240> down<00:01:21.659> here<00:01:21.900> on<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.080> side<00:01:22.259> of<00:01:22.350> the

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
hole down here on the side of the

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.789 
hole down here on the side of the
cartomizer<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:23.189> it'll<00:01:23.369> start<00:01:23.610> bubbling<00:01:23.970> and

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
cartomizer and it'll start bubbling and

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:28.010 
cartomizer and it'll start bubbling and
it'll<00:01:25.799> almost<00:01:26.130> take<00:01:26.340> this<00:01:26.610> whole<00:01:26.880> tank<00:01:27.240> before

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
it'll almost take this whole tank before

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.530 
it'll almost take this whole tank before
the<00:01:28.200> cartomizers<00:01:28.799> pretty<00:01:29.400> much<00:01:29.579> saturated<00:01:29.880> so

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
the cartomizers pretty much saturated so

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.780 
the cartomizers pretty much saturated so
you'll<00:01:31.320> see<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.619> levels<00:01:31.950> go<00:01:32.070> down<00:01:32.250> as<00:01:32.430> I<00:01:32.549> start

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
you'll see the levels go down as I start

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:46.800 
you'll see the levels go down as I start
filling<00:01:33.000> this<00:01:33.180> up

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.200 

as<00:01:47.409> you<00:01:47.680> can<00:01:47.740> see<00:01:47.979> that's<00:01:48.490> gone<00:01:48.729> down<00:01:48.759> quite<00:01:49.180> a

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
as you can see that's gone down quite a

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:50.999 
as you can see that's gone down quite a
bit<00:01:49.299> i<00:01:49.450> hear<00:01:49.810> the<00:01:50.020> liquid<00:01:50.320> gurgling<00:01:50.740> in<00:01:50.890> the

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
bit i hear the liquid gurgling in the

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:52.889 
bit i hear the liquid gurgling in the
cartomizer<00:01:51.310> so<00:01:51.820> i<00:01:51.850> know<00:01:52.000> it's<00:01:52.299> got<00:01:52.479> enough<00:01:52.750> in

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
cartomizer so i know it's got enough in
