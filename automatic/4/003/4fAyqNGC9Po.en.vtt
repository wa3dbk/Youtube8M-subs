00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.640
 we know that most of you do not 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:09.500
 you know what your people are eating 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.389
 dogs and cats and that you have taken the 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.430
 decision to buy your food because 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:15.019
 a commercial seller friend or 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:17.150
 veterinarian has told you that it is 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:19.700
 quality and healthy but what about 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.650
 true in this affirmation for that we have 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.300
 created this section in which we will give you 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:26.029
 all the information so you can 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.710
 decide for yourself within the 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:29.600
 products that you can find in the 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.059
 market to feed your dog or cat 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.949
 are the processed foods under the 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:36.589
 animal feed regulations of 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:39.589
 company that are generally feed and 

00:00:36.589 --> 00:00:41.839
 food cans moisture and on the other hand 

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:43.570
 the highest quality foods that are 

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:45.860
 the dehydrated at low temperature 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.600
 made in food factories to 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.970
 and under the regulations of 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.430
 human nutrition we explain the 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.320
 difference food processing 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.150
 for pets works through a 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.979
 system that starts from the withdrawal of 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:00.110
 by - products of human nutrition 

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:01.519
 that is to say that we are giving to our 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.699
 dogs and cats the debris that 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:06.560
 we generate people this includes the 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.539
 works that come out of the slaughterhouses after 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.190
 to separate all parts of the animal 

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:13.580
 which are for human consumption 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:15.860
 bones carcasses skins guts paws or 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.270
 heads or other ingredients that by the 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.280
 whatever reason would not happen a 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.470
 inspection and are declared as not 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.610
 fit for human consumption are used 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.610
 to feed our animals 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.540
 the fish industry could feed for 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.430
 pets get that as per art of 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.930
 magic to all these by-products that from 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.510
 otherwise they would have to go to the trash 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.330
 when your dog and your cat eat them 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:41.180
 become profit that is to say in 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.440
 money for example you can buy a 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.560
 sack of feed in a clinic 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.210
 veterinary for a price of 87 euros at 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.460
 look at the list of ingredients you read 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.220
 the next 20 percent meat of 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.530
 chicken corn wheat fat animals apple 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.750
 pear pumpkin beet pulp eggs 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.180
 Preservatives and authorized colorants 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.460
 for the European Union 'good 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.400
 apparently it is not a bad diet but 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:07.040
 let's see what is true in this 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.770
 Actually when you remove the water is 20 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.860
 percent of chicken is reduced to 7 2% 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:15.470
 but what is even worse is that that 7 with 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.690
 2% remaining chicken can be heads 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.530
 legs and carcasses not the meat that you 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.530
 you were imagining 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.379
 fruits and vegetables and cereals can 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.780
 be the remains that come out of any 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:29.030
 factory that use these products as 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.040
 the beet pulp present in many 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.629
 feed that is nothing more than the waste that 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.750
 it remains after squeezing the beet 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:36.640
 to get the sugar 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.470
 the fear that the ingredients are 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.240
 contaminated and the process itself to 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.890
 make the balls of feed brings them to 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.230
 the manufacturers to use high 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.880
 temperatures what they do not tell us is 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.400
 that this in addition to killing possible 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.600
 pathogens like bacteria and parasites 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.580
 it also kills much of the value 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.030
 Nutritional food including 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.590
 vitamins and essential amino acids but 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.930
 Why would your dog or cat 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.640
 eat this in the process of 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.530
 manufacture after crushing the 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.380
 ingredients are given a fat bath 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.020
 which makes it more appetizing how are you 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.690
 fats will enter very easily 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:12.280
 they need to use preservatives between 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:16.110
 the preservatives that we can find 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:18.060
 is in hiv the tea hiv or the toxin 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:19.290
 Many dogs are allergic to 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.360
 foods that contain preservatives 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.520
 chemicals and have chronic symptoms 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.640
 as the excess of itching diarrheas 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.840
 usual or just upset 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.810
 problems that will remain there while not 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.240
 chemical substances are withdrawn 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.770
 how much is all this really very little 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.690
 but a lack of information and a 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:39.750
 brilliant marketing have gotten that 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.280
 you pay 87 euros for buying it you see 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.660
 that not for paying a lot of money you're 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.730
 giving a good food to your dog or cat 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.850
 but those who may be paying a 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.890
 very expensive price are our animals a 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.420
 recent scientific study talks about the 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.130
 high rates of cancer increase 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.930
 bone in dogs and cats that are 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.570
 related to the fluorine in the 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:00.000
 animal byproducts other studies 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:02.610
 suggest that 74.7 percent of 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.170
 common diseases in dogs and 63 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.850
 percent of common diseases in 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.800
 cats can be eliminated without 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:10.080
 medical intervention in a period of one 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.870
 year only through a correct 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.850
 food on the other hand there are 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.829
 food for dogs and cats like naku 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.530
 which are based on the regulations of 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:21.239
 the difference human consumption 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.220
 quality controls the requirements 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.200
 health 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:27.740
 and remember the by-products that 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:29.990
 we talked before they are all banned 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.330
 We know that your body needs food 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.849
 fresh quality and varied meat 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.259
 fish fruit vegetable food 

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:39.680
 fresh contain the ingredient 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:41.780
 fundamental life possess enzymes 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.849
 natural probiotic antioxidants 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.979
 vitamins and minerals in your state 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:48.910
 natural and it is impossible to find this 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:50.890
 inside a dry ball of feed 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.350
 The manufacturing process has been the 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:54.730
 dehydration at low temperature 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:57.250
 slowly baking ingredients 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.750
 to eliminate the water because they are 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.700
 quality ingredients since they have 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.160
 had a minimal processing is not 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.600
 necessary to use animal fats 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.620
 preservative dyes or any other 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:09.020
 chemical additive 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.820
 the ingredients look smelly and 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.490
 recover their original texture once 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.590
 rehydrated a recent study 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.210
 concluded that 78 percent of the 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:19.550
 animals that are passed on to this type of 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:22.669
 food improve your skin problems and 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:25.250
 hairs related to allergies 82% 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:26.630
 improves its digestion and 61 percent 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:30.360
 of the owners believes that this food 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:32.430
 can lengthen the life of your dog or cat 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.330
 this type of food is developed 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.330
 to meet the needs 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:38.159
 nutrition of your dog or cat yes 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:40.319
 remember we are talking about food 

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:41.909
 fresh and that as such can be mixed 

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:44.449
 with other fresh ingredients that 

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:46.650
 have at home meat fruits vegetables 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:49.789
 remember that the ingredients of nagua 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.789
 are fit for human consumption 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:58.400
 for the quality and digestibility of the 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:00.110
 ingredients of na q the ration that you should 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.570
 give your dog or cat is less than in 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.340
 the rest of the food but when mixed 

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:06.110
 with water and recover its natural moisture 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:08.800
 what is not going to happen to you is that 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:08.800
 be hungry
