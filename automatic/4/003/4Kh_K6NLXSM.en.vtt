try and get onto the handle Dex is like

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.800 
try and get onto the handle Dex is like
a<00:02:44.610> little<00:02:44.760> berry<00:02:45.030> for<00:02:45.270> the<00:02:45.300> handle<00:02:45.600> but<00:02:45.720> I

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
a little berry for the handle but I

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.100 
a little berry for the handle but I
can't<00:02:46.080> do<00:02:46.230> that<00:02:47.330> there<00:02:48.330> is<00:02:48.420> one<00:02:48.660> more<00:02:48.870> way<00:02:48.930> you

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
can't do that there is one more way you

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.790 
can't do that there is one more way you
can<00:02:49.440> do<00:02:49.590> it<00:02:49.770> but<00:02:50.700> it<00:02:51.030> does<00:02:51.480> require<00:02:51.660> a<00:02:51.900> few<00:02:52.440> care
