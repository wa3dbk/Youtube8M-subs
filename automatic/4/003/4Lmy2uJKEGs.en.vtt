00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:10.740
 yes, what a welcome that was 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.929
 resolution's later first time to 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.599
 left ears many comments to 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.750
 Thank you for that and I want to go first 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.699
 read a comment by david kiliani 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.650
 which has become the theme of di maria and 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.869
 his switch to psg the possible 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.279
 change to petri voiced and he says it 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.869
 brings nothing without thinking 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.029
 to buy world stars 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.160
 which in the end do not match the 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.040
 champions league title will be around for a long time 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.690
 do not forgive to france yes there 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.190
 I'll see that as well, thanks for 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.750
 the comment a team needs 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.950
 somehow still put together like that 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.809
 that does not go by names but that 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.059
 it looks homogeneous the whole I see completely 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.649
 just as much thanks for the comment fries 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.110
 blog I think we already had one 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.530
 a few times with our comments no matter 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.699
 He said Werder and Successor 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.980
 from franco di santo 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.440
 there is the pc and says that that 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.430
 the ideal transfer would be and that would be 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.780
 to be killed 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.420
 I think that it very many berner 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.400
 fans every bit as always that the 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.119
 the end of what will be and finally all 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.310
 kÃ¶ster wishes the band there 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.860
 he is fair, he writes and he would 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.890
 the whole league spanking 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.299
 according to bender from lord bender to the other 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.340
 Striker Mario Gomez 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.710
 according to italian media is the so 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.509
 farewell to gomez from florence before and 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.890
 that has three reasons for one heard 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.409
 gomez to the top earners of the league 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.329
 gets 4.2 million euros a year 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.560
 is just too much for the water in 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.590
 Moment of performance brings 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.240
 secondly gomez has just 14 goals in 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.280
 The last two years closed that 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.390
 is too little and third is com 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.189
 just too often hurt 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.560
 and for that nothing can indeed but 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.110
 florence just as little now 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.659
 Do you understand what the torero gesture on 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.509
 should start and I would like from 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.180
 you know what gomez can do in turkey 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.979
 he starts traveling, he brings himself 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.840
 again a focus with jogi writes 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.990
 underneath I 'm looking forward to it 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.990
 purely
