 in the truth story that telling me 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:09.049
 I go to bed and I have beautiful dreams 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.920
 not the truth 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.920
 Water

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:55.289
 that is to say his next two versions 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.630
 we go 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.049
 and cinematic when video games 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.270
 they decide to narrate using resources 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:27.039
 cinematic how are the planes and 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.420
 the assembly is becoming more common 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:31.890
 the triple-a use this for 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:34.570
 tell us your stories this is not good 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.569
 let's go to the terms videogames 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:40.179
 they are not digital games they are digital art 

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:42.369
 interactive in the same way as the cinema 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:44.590
 it's audiovisual art or comic art 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.210
 is sequential printed art when a 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.880
 videogame makes you sit down to see a 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.110
 kinematics you do not do anything as a player and 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.849
 the only thing you can do to 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.259
 contribute to the story is not to press 

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:55.780
 by mistake a button and remove the 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:58.270
 cinematic fuck what I want to say is 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.520
 that this is not an interactive way of 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.959
 narrate not only that also prevents 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.759
 video games can be expressed in 

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:05.649
 all its potential and contributes to the 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.959
 gameplay is becoming less organic 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.729
 you put to think you'll see dozens of 

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:11.380
 movies that reach their zenith through 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.700
 of images and montage and books 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.440
 who need the introspection of the 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.360
 Literature to express yourself fully 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.650
 Now I want you to do something for me look 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.329
 of your game collection or 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.069
 reviewed that video games you have to 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:23.230
 need this means to express themselves 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.850
 fully I can tell you a lot 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.100
 that they have made a mistake 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.570
 gears of war black ops 2 uncharted final 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.820
 fantasy 13 'medal of honor' warfighter 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.050
 prototype of the schools aces and script 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.790
 one day I was downloading the 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.290
 kinematics and the software test for one 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.150
 of my videos and I saw a comment that 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.650
 said that when you can see only the 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.120
 cinematic of a game and you find out about 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.690
 your story you know it's a good 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.400
 video game is not a good video game 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.990
 It's a good movie 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.490
 if you want to sit down and see how everything 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.620
 it happens without you there is a wonderful medium 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:53.470
 a couple of franchute called lumiÃ¨re 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.330
 or something like that they created in 1895 I think it 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.350
 called cinema but here we are not for 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.840
 be spectators 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.100
 the gamers are actors now that I've 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.210
 done what any human being with 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.490
 two neurons and vocal cords 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:05.470
 functional knows what to do is criticize 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:07.570
 I will offer an answer as 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.850
 narrates as being a video game 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.620
 implying the player half life 2 is a 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.570
 great example of how to integrate the player 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.700
 in a linear narrative is a game 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.840
 where you decide how much you want to know the 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.450
 world around you that is 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.790
 perfectly built live and with 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.900
 elements happening around you 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.970
 constantly these decisions if 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.410
 you want to discover its mysteries or not by 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.630
 example the game opens with gordon freeman 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.870
 arriving at the city station 17 a 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.700
 impatient player to pass olympically 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.110
 was fired waiting for some 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.879
 written tell what it is that you have to 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.950
 make and lose a lot of information 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:39.840
 along the way a curious player without 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.519
 However, you can decide to approach the 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.260
 many characters from the station and 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:45.120
 listen to the bryn dialogue and then 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.799
 will discover what is really happening 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.569
 someone who does not notice will not know what is 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.890
 the face of seven hours will not have the 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:51.390
 even the slightest idea of what has happened 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:53.159
 from the facts on black table 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.920
 halffter 2 allows this because it does not have 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:58.079
 a single kinematics is always in time 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.450
 Real and the player endorses the 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:01.890
 history and integrates in the world but 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.989
 this only the very perception of the 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:06.180
 history the player has to be able 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.530
 to express yourself through the work that is 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.900
 something that works in assassin's creed 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.730
 you know why the game is in real time 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.500
 altair can move freely and the 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.299
 player can change the plane that's 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.760
 because patrice desilets one of his 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:19.260
 authors was actor of the method today I wanted 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.910
 that players could act 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.949
 through altair and express themselves through 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.870
 his gestures his interpretation of the workshop 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:26.820
 For example, always turn your back on the 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.560
 People talking while joel playing 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.120
 could interpret an attentive altair 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.070
 always close to the people he serves 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.479
 these are separate ways of counting the 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.919
 story but for an example that 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:37.050
 combine both elements we have the 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:39.569
 bethesda games in skyrim 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.190
 I get information according to my environment and 

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:42.810
 that there are books or digital files that 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.639
 hacked read and can also 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.349
 express myself according to my preferences because 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:48.389
 I can decide the direction of my character 

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:50.129
 the missions he takes and his disposition 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:52.289
 moral like that is like video games 

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:54.270
 should be expressed integrating the 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:55.740
 player and making him feel like he's in 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.690
 the story for some reason not 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.699
 observing but discovering 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.530
 participating in some way when a 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:03.389
 game decides to use kinematics does 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:04.770
 the opposite is presenting the work of 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:06.990
 So the player is passive 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.970
 unnecessary we can not participate in a 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.349
 supposedly interactive medium because 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.449
 you take control of the protagonist 

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:14.250
 because we can not do what he is 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:16.050
 doing the cinematics in addition 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.699
 discredit the medium because they make 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.469
 people to focus on film follows 

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:21.150
 happening but before it was very usual 

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:23.400
 that the games said they were so 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:25.830
 good or better than movies from 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.629
 hollywood although I do not know if it's an achievement yes 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.490
 and it's worth at the beginning the cinema had a lot 

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:31.379
 theater and photography had a lot of 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.030
 painting and realistic painting a lot of 

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:34.319
 photography but then every medium 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:36.000
 established its own avenues of 

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:38.039
 expression so he can not work 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.900
 the abstraction outside the painting and the 

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:41.430
 recording of Tiananmen square no 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:43.289
 it would be the same historical document if 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.770
 was a poem video games have 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:45.539
 What next 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.550
 of the need to tell everything with 

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:49.710
 cinematic now it would be that 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:51.840
 completely get rid of them do not 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:54.210
 exactly the problem of 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:55.860
 kinematics is not so much that they exist as 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:57.720
 that is in the main medium of 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:59.340
 expression out of the 'indie' scene the 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.110
 people do not ask how they should 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:02.780
 express yourself to video games but the 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.199
 kinematics are still not subtle 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:06.419
 traditionally they have served as 

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:08.129
 rewards with the player after 

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:10.020
 So long struggling to overcome a 

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:11.490
 level or win the challenge in turn the 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:13.169
 game rewards us with a few 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:15.300
 minutes to rest and watch progress 

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:17.370
 the argument something that I always like 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.659
 is to finish the game and relax for 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:20.759
 see how everything closes in a 

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:22.590
 very long cinematic because my 

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:24.240
 interaction is no longer necessary I've done 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:26.009
 what he owed and now the characters are 

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:28.560
 free to leave the end of metal gear 

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:30.330
 solid 2 is a very clear example because 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:32.009
 reid in literally ceases to be the 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.509
 puppet of the player to happen to be 

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:35.159
 owner of his own destiny 

00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:37.080
 this would be difficult to express without a 

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:39.060
 cinematic another example are the moments 

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:41.009
 that they absolutely need 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.629
 other resources to exist for example 

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:44.190
 in the personal saga from time to time the 

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:46.139
 story turns to anime for scenes 

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:47.580
 very important and spectacular or 

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:48.969
 moments that would be impossible to 

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:51.099
 show with the game engine 

00:06:48.969 --> 00:06:53.259
 because with this you can not do much 

00:06:51.099 --> 00:06:55.289
 the final fantasy theses are something 

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:57.669
 like remarked crucial moments 

00:06:55.289 --> 00:06:59.829
 they need the great display of effects 

00:06:57.669 --> 00:07:01.479
 you are cinematic as an exception are 

00:06:59.829 --> 00:07:03.639
 acceptable because here they are not being 

00:07:01.479 --> 00:07:06.069
 but the primary means something 

00:07:03.639 --> 00:07:07.629
 use for very special moments 

00:07:06.069 --> 00:07:09.610
 Shannon the Colossus is a good example 

00:07:07.629 --> 00:07:10.989
 the game is mainly the player 

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:13.179
 going from one place to another to kill 

00:07:10.989 --> 00:07:14.919
 colossus there are hardly four cinematics in 

00:07:13.179 --> 00:07:16.719
 the whole story but they are all 

00:07:14.919 --> 00:07:18.610
 necessary because they advance the plot 

00:07:16.719 --> 00:07:20.649
 so it would be very difficult and maybe 

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:21.969
 not so interesting in real time is it 

00:07:20.649 --> 00:07:24.099
 a game that knows when it is necessary 

00:07:21.969 --> 00:07:25.959
 broadcast according to the rules of the cinema and 

00:07:24.099 --> 00:07:27.579
 when it is necessary to integrate the player 

00:07:25.959 --> 00:07:29.559
 in what happens and that's why it's so 

00:07:27.579 --> 00:07:31.539
 special yet there is no citizen who in 

00:07:29.559 --> 00:07:33.879
 definitive video game if we have 

00:07:31.539 --> 00:07:35.589
 to our links mÃ©liÃ¨s and moore us but 

00:07:33.879 --> 00:07:37.119
 we have no one who unified the
