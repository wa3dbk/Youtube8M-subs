00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:16.590
 yes there I am again I could 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.710
 not turn earlier but now I come 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.109
 Finally, please wonder about the in 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.640
 the kultura you thought you are back 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.849
 Maybe not and how to get it right now 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.220
 but which window will close then 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.679
 are stifled because I'm here 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.160
 under the roof and then it's easy too 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.809
 warm 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.670
 I wanted to give you the pink box today 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.620
 but not only show my but also 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.360
 the form of a friend of the slow 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.010
 that has me again a picture of 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.989
 sent her box so you see what 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.690
 in her box were not only something in 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.430
 So my inside is watch mobile phone 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.789
 what she had different say so highest 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.129
 can 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.600
 For one, she had a software with 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.829
 cream from Manhattan 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.000
 as far as I know, I'm going out of the assortment 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.250
 may be that here is the remainders 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.780
 to pack in the boxes so that comes to me 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.390
 at least because I know that here 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.339
 but go out with it was to everyone 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:10.260
 Be satisfied with what you are in yourself 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.909
 then likes a foot care from scholl 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.770
 is actually quite a bit 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.330
 confident on the one full size 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.310
 is or not but I think so 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.009
 she was pretty tall out of plan 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.189
 may look forward to a shampoo in it 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.170
 that is also a miniature there would be 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.630
 police will cost it 290 but that is now 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.799
 a small size then a nail polish 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.950
 from eden 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:35.759
 I do not know if that's what it is 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.650
 but I know yes no call is yes 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.689
 the brand knows so could totally 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.159
 but you can find the nail polish 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.470
 In any case , she is beautiful too 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.350
 already marked and then she had 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.990
 then a nail file fitting people 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.560
 she had a cream of it, too 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.600
 for five euros 99 and she said she 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.290
 learned box altogether very satisfied 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.020
 been 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:01.710
 No product in there with wow factor 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.390
 sentence said but definitely 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.660
 Happy and the magazine you 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.119
 was the couch so now you can 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.009
 Let's see how that in relation to 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.590
 my box is I'll show you the times 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.090
 had time writing that's the way it is 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.060
 is Italy 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.800
 I do not know them but find them 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.610
 I am very good because the concept is in there and 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.320
 Recipes are always good and it costs 94 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.550
 is not that cheap 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.570
 but there are really very beautiful ones 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.290
 photos gigs for that I am also 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:37.890
 always to have 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:41.130
 I'll say an example is everything 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.840
 But Italian cuisine is not 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.430
 easy the broker pizza 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.610
 There are people who do not like pizza 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.650
 pizza I've included some point 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:54.570
 but we you were someone had he had 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:57.570
 no pizza and there I was like that 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.459
 then she gave another hello fresh 20 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.560
 euro coupon is also quite cool 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.590
 out and box system with food 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:08.250
 I still believe advertising and come here 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:10.590
 We now have the box I had yesterday 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.380
 already yesterday or the day before yesterday 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.360
 unpacked the yesterday and ever that 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.000
 Feelings out there otherwise that too 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:22.739
 always around and I had exactly 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.660
 how long the skin cream trainer for that 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:27.240
 that was 45 59 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.130
 not and that is a matting of the 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.990
 day nurse i prefer to get out i have 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:41.790
 not done yet 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:44.520
 which looks ok so mix a glass of tea 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.510
 so very bad looks quite good 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:49.200
 probably until then 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.950
 it does not smell that does not smell 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.690
 very pleasant 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.100
 So with the map in any case something 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.740
 I have two, I still have it 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.970
 think two krems still as a backup from it 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:00.620
 will not take her until I die 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:02.520
 then really break and use but 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.230
 if i'm definitely good on you 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.570
 in it 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.610
 all nail files are also important 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:11.430
 but not the latte but 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:14.760
 she had another from elina 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.200
 but last time a bodylotion you 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.940
 But I think it hurt a lot 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.830
 is sensitive and you did not know if 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.930
 this tolerates and no idea why 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:23.910
 I was working and this is now 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:27.780
 a nail file of them costs mobile phone 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:29.160
 149 and it's a polished i think 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.620
 you can always use it easily 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:33.600
 She likes to talk about it 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.340
 to remove from the needle but I like 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.160
 they really like to share these parts 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:40.860
 I think that was quite good then 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.640
 I also like this mini part of may 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:47.070
 this is intense reperatur shampoo 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:50.130
 I mean the lavage lately 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.840
 I have also had a suit in it 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.160
 already used and I have none now 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.500
 Great effect to be honest 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.510
 I think I had that shampoo 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.860
 ever 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:00.870
 I think so in the crook I have me 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.669
 I believe myself and in the inbox or 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.690
 I do not remember but I mean 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:07.290
 that we have been good 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:10.500
 So I'm not satisfied there 

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:13.770
 it's a mainhattan professional smokey 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.600
 Eyes kids an eyeshadow palette the 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:19.729
 I do not know colors now that mine 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:23.449
 so to speak these are so blue shades 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:25.309
 is relatively rare but to itself 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:28.249
 cool that there is such a palette in there 

00:05:25.309 --> 00:05:30.289
 because yes I find the chep palettes 

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:31.909
 simply cool currency market is when you 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:33.229
 all at once has several colors the 

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:34.969
 then matched 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:36.199
 you can just grab one 

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:38.270
 and then you do not have to look 

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:40.610
 which features I am now with a 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:45.199
 palette and good is why I think so 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:47.389
 it also good, by the way, 795 then 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:51.770
 I still had a small sample of 

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:54.259
 pittsburgh with brink analogous one speaks 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:56.809
 that's definitely one of them 

00:05:54.259 --> 00:05:59.240
 special protection cream with 

00:05:56.809 --> 00:06:02.360
 sun protection factor 15 that's natural 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:05.419
 a sample and 150 milliliters of it 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:09.770
 would cost just under 20 euros and here 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:10.339
 we have 15 milliliters I find quite 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:12.139
 OK 

00:06:10.339 --> 00:06:13.159
 the handbag if you then where I am 

00:06:12.139 --> 00:06:15.319
 maybe I need another one 

00:06:13.159 --> 00:06:18.439
 then you can take that and 

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:20.870
 still rich from scholl a party feet 

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:23.479
 invisible gel bale upholstery 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:26.449
 thats i think for high heels i 

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:27.649
 Only have comfortable shoes and no money 

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:30.080
 that's why I'll probably do it 

00:06:27.649 --> 00:06:31.490
 not need but can see 

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:34.129
 maybe that will change too 

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:38.569
 At some point I call it 

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:39.919
 but yes, that's nice 

00:06:38.569 --> 00:06:41.029
 now not so much more to start but 

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:42.110
 I think I'm really cool 

00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:45.800
 believe these parts are still 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:49.969
 relatively expensive what does it cost you 390 goes 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:51.439
 still ok that was my box i hope 

00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:53.539
 The video has fallen to you again 

00:06:51.439 --> 00:06:55.129
 so the comparison so what my best 

00:06:53.539 --> 00:06:57.199
 had girlfriend and what I had 

00:06:55.129 --> 00:06:59.360
 I think it was very balanced this time 

00:06:57.199 --> 00:07:02.300
 so she has dekker's good box and me 

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:03.740
 actually , so I am satisfied 

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:05.569
 she is satisfied you are up and 

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:06.770
 Europe satisfied you would be satisfied with 

00:07:05.569 --> 00:07:09.229
 been in our boxing 

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:11.509
 Do not let me know and there I would 

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:13.569
 a very nice sunny day and 

00:07:11.509 --> 00:07:16.189
 until next time 

00:07:13.569 --> 00:07:17.230
 but this is a brush 

00:07:16.189 --> 00:07:19.390
 yes mostly or one 

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:20.830
 always necessary to have which makes the 

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:23.200
 not really out and about that 

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:26.070
 really gets out of the last rest 

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:26.070
 then I take out
