cover this bed I usually put black
plastic<00:02:10.780> on<00:02:11.200> like<00:02:12.100> the<00:02:12.250> other<00:02:12.400> beds<00:02:12.670> but<00:02:12.880> this

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
plastic on like the other beds but this

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.070 
plastic on like the other beds but this
one<00:02:13.180> I<00:02:13.210> thought<00:02:13.390> well<00:02:13.570> let's<00:02:13.690> just<00:02:13.840> see<00:02:13.930> what

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
one I thought well let's just see what

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.690 
one I thought well let's just see what
happens<00:02:14.410> and<00:02:15.040> I<00:02:15.160> was<00:02:15.250> wondering<00:02:15.520> if<00:02:15.610> the

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700

happens and I was wondering if the
greens<00:02:16.000> would<00:02:16.240> overwinter<00:02:16.810> with<00:02:16.960> a<00:02:16.990> thermal

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
greens would overwinter with a thermal

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.620 
greens would overwinter with a thermal
layer<00:02:17.950> a<00:02:18.280> thermal<00:02:18.700> blanket<00:02:18.790> of<00:02:19.120> snow<00:02:19.330> and<00:02:19.540> it

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
layer a thermal blanket of snow and it

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.540 
layer a thermal blanket of snow and it
didn't<00:02:19.810> happen<00:02:19.950> except<00:02:20.950> for<00:02:21.100> like<00:02:21.160> the<00:02:21.310> kale

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
didn't happen except for like the kale

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.030 
didn't happen except for like the kale
is<00:02:21.730> this<00:02:22.180> one<00:02:22.330> was<00:02:22.480> really<00:02:22.750> Hardy<00:02:23.080> and<00:02:23.290> it's

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
is this one was really Hardy and it's

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.140 
is this one was really Hardy and it's
sprouting<00:02:24.460> back<00:02:24.640> so<00:02:24.790> we're<00:02:24.880> just<00:02:24.910> going<00:02:25.090> to

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
sprouting back so we're just going to

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.820 
sprouting back so we're just going to
keep<00:02:25.330> that<00:02:25.450> guy<00:02:25.630> going<00:02:25.930> take<00:02:26.620> your<00:02:26.770> seed<00:02:27.010> mix

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.110 
book country wisdom and know-how I think
it's<00:02:46.799> called<00:02:46.950> and<00:02:47.129> there's<00:02:47.310> an<00:02:47.459> article<00:02:47.939> about

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
it's called and there's an article about

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.899 
it's called and there's an article about
that<00:02:48.620> I<00:02:49.620> like<00:02:50.040> the<00:02:50.159> fun<00:02:50.340> I'm<00:02:50.459> gonna<00:02:50.549> change<00:02:50.819> the

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:50.909 
that I like the fun I'm gonna change the

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:52.970 
that I like the fun I'm gonna change the
garden<00:02:51.150> for<00:02:51.209> clover<00:02:51.510> to<00:02:51.599> that<00:02:51.719> fun<00:02:51.870> but<00:02:52.859> they

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
garden for clover to that fun but they

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:53.929 
garden for clover to that fun but they
talked<00:02:53.189> about<00:02:53.340> this<00:02:53.430> a<00:02:53.489> bit<00:02:53.579> but<00:02:53.819> basically

00:02:53.929 --> 00:02:53.939 
talked about this a bit but basically

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:56.119 
talked about this a bit but basically
it's<00:02:54.420> more<00:02:54.569> efficient<00:02:55.049> to<00:02:55.140> grow<00:02:55.379> wider<00:02:55.709> rows

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:56.129 
it's more efficient to grow wider rows

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:57.860 
it's more efficient to grow wider rows
of<00:02:56.340> things<00:02:56.519> not<00:02:56.700> just<00:02:56.760> single<00:02:57.299> rows<00:02:57.480> of<00:02:57.659> things

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
of things not just single rows of things

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.530 
of things not just single rows of things
so<00:02:58.500> I<00:02:58.530> like<00:02:58.650> that<00:02:58.980> kind<00:02:59.099> of<00:02:59.189> thing<00:02:59.390> so<00:03:00.390> what<00:03:00.510> I

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
so I like that kind of thing so what I

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.050 
so I like that kind of thing so what I
do<00:03:00.659> is<00:03:00.870> between<00:03:01.319> each<00:03:01.620> irrigation<00:03:02.609> hose<00:03:02.790> I

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
do is between each irrigation hose I

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.339 
do is between each irrigation hose I
spread<00:03:03.329> a<00:03:03.389> bunch<00:03:03.599> of<00:03:03.689> this<00:03:03.780> then<00:03:04.139> we're<00:03:04.230> going

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
spread a bunch of this then we're going

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:10.699 
spread a bunch of this then we're going
to<00:03:04.379> tamp<00:03:04.650> it<00:03:04.739> down<00:03:04.799> with<00:03:05.069> our<00:03:05.189> hand<00:03:09.530> so<00:03:10.530> it

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
to tamp it down with our hand so it

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.589 
to tamp it down with our hand so it
connects<00:03:11.069> with<00:03:11.220> the<00:03:11.340> soil<00:03:11.639> and<00:03:11.970> then<00:03:12.480> I'm

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
connects with the soil and then I'm

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:17.449 
connects with the soil and then I'm
going<00:03:12.750> to<00:03:12.780> take<00:03:13.340> some<00:03:14.340> more<00:03:14.519> soil<00:03:14.870> and<00:03:16.459> cover

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
going to take some more soil and cover

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.890
