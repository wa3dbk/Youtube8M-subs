00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 Hi Gurias and colors, I'll go 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:05.910
 show you this productive and 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.040
 dove 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:13.530
 you must have seen or 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:15.330
 even used in r therapy here is is a 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.460
 product that promises to rebuild 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.699
 hair with the help of the 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.890
 heat coming in this heat activator 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.449
 here this productive here I already had 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.400
 used in a long time ago except I 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.890
 can not make video I think it was 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.720
 at the time of my return change and not 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.239
 Can do video and was very very 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.600
 perfect my hair inside this 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.160
 Well, I think it's the sachet of 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.649
 complete reconstruction of treatment 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:46.710
 rebuilder its use in the box even there 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.770
 the right hair with the usual show 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.770
 apply the reconstructive treatment and soon 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.440
 above applies the heat activator that 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.030
 this wide line I do not know the drawing 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.239
 this marcelo to us but when a 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.340
 and apply this policy to the 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.460
 of treatment time almost here now 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.950
 so I already took my whole hair, play 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.729
 that I thought it was my hair all 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.650
 Right, I'm very careful because 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.689
 how are you alone in the shampoo I washed set 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.600
 Okay, people are being wonderful, my 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:22.770
 hair how I like it and then I go 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.439
 putting it in the hand and I'm passing wick 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.600
 to cover all the children of the 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.850
 Guys I'm going to make an advance on the video. 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.110
 not to be clear is very tiring 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.810
 for you guys 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.810
 and then I'm going through my hair 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:44.280
 one very important thing is not to use 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:47.070
 root is refusing is the length of the 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.369
 hair down to the ends can not 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.369
 lose more 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:02:00.210
 now it is the turn of the heat activator in the 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:03.750
 hand it warm up a bit, it's already there 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:07.710
 hair I must say that he does not 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:11.280
 Warm up, no , no, no 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.620
 very warm does not give a mild warm 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.660
 But so it is soon. 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:21.000
 been here all this warming is the 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:24.150
 People activator is the biggest gain is well well 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.540
 the line itself is not come very thin 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:30.600
 so it is not a detector that is with 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.489
 oil, not even for those who have hair 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.560
 oily that will not have problem 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:37.290
 I've already finished all my hair and it's 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.170
 indicated and allowed to rotate with 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.420
 hair for about three minutes more 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.100
 I'm sincere in saying I leave around 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.690
 Five minutes, so I'll leave. 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.519
 five minutes without a stop I will not go 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.130
 I'll put the hat on, I'll just leave it 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:52.620
 I will even let my hair down, I'll wash my hair 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.269
 I'll dry it but I'll have it 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.250
 use the dryer because otherwise it will 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.829
 take too long to dry and come back to 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:02.880
 show you how the hair has turned 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:05.310
 so I just watch him just remove the 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.310
 product did not pass anything later 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.799
 And then I went with a dryer, but I did not. 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.350
 I do not know how many 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:16.019
 'very totally because there is a lot of 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.780
 patience will stay in the dryer and hence 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:22.440
 of my hair is still a 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.359
 little moist and but look only the hair stays 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.030
 so fine, fine with a lot of trim 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:30.239
 A very nice swing, a nice swing. 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:33.780
 real wonderful and brightness as well 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:36.600
 it's incredibly looks like a mirror then 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:39.090
 it's super approved this product already had 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.310
 used at other times i did not win country 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.859
 productive I bought and paid super 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.880
 cheap was not more than 15 reais 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:49.270
 But that's it then the video I expect 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.050

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.450
