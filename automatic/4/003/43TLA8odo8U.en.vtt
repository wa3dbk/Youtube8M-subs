start<00:00:34.440> I<00:00:34.710> kind<00:00:35.700> of<00:00:35.730> expected<00:00:36.149> that<00:00:36.300> if<00:00:36.420> I<00:00:36.540> put<00:00:36.719> a

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
start I kind of expected that if I put a

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.180 
start I kind of expected that if I put a
battery<00:00:36.960> booster<00:00:37.440> on<00:00:37.559> it<00:00:37.680> it<00:00:37.829> would<00:00:37.980> start

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
battery booster on it it would start

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.330

right<00:00:38.430> up<00:00:38.719> the<00:00:39.719> battery<00:00:40.050> booster<00:00:40.469> did<00:00:40.890> not<00:00:41.070> do

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
right up the battery booster did not do

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.250 
right up the battery booster did not do
it<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.700> electrical<00:00:42.390> system<00:00:42.690> did<00:00:42.840> not<00:00:42.870> want<00:00:43.200> to

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
it the electrical system did not want to

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.619 
it the electrical system did not want to
start<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.590> car<00:00:43.800> with<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.070> booster<00:00:44.430> on<00:00:44.550> it<00:00:44.670> so

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
start the car with the booster on it so
