00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.180
 you are practically alone and have the 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.130
 glow plugs 12 burnt glow plugs of 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.440
 your long-standing cord those 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.190
 that you glow the glow plugs you have to 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.769
 be two to spray the start 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.480
 what did I invent what I did 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:20.039
 because someone has certainly done it 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.390
 I didn't invent anything 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.410
 of particular 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:28.349
 admitted a tube that goes here it is 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.350
 this near neighbor is inside 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:36.190
 the passenger compartment passes behind 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:37.899
 but what you see in the engine compartment 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:42.130
 enters a hole in the compartment 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:44.320
 engine and moves into position 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.920
 made a hole above the air filter 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.079
 They have pulled the tube 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.920
 from this doubts I am bending now I put it there 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:57.210
 start is this cylinder will hold then 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.550
 from the inside I can't spray it 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.210
 start directly goes into the filter 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.449
 air while I turn on let 's see what 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.449
 It happens 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:14.460
 let's try turning on the camper 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:17.430
 then let's heat those up anyway 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.399
 a few glow plugs that are still in it 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.800
 life 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:27.000
 then the staff is ready while starting 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:32.880
 the spray engine is a little bit of tonnage 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:38.330
 so we see then stopped by a 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.330
 year we have 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.070
 the action succeeded perfectly at 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.070
 first shot 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.600
 the cockpit was successful 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.630
 the air filter 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.730
 he understood even if he has one or two candles 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.730
 and burn
