then go from the other side exactly the

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.359 
then go from the other side exactly the
same<00:01:05.979> way<00:01:07.170> I'm<00:01:08.170> assured<00:01:08.560> that<00:01:08.920> some<00:01:09.130> stage

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:09.369 
same way I'm assured that some stage

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:12.260 
same way I'm assured that some stage
meet<00:01:09.670> in<00:01:09.880> the<00:01:09.970> middle

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.819 

once<00:01:13.270> you're<00:01:13.630> all<00:01:13.780> the<00:01:13.810> way<00:01:13.990> through<00:01:14.380> there

once you're all the way through there

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:18.179 
once you're all the way through there
should<00:01:14.979> be<00:01:15.100> a<00:01:15.130> gap<00:01:16.409> you<00:01:17.409> can<00:01:17.560> see<00:01:17.740> that<00:01:17.920> there

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:18.189 
should be a gap you can see that there

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:21.120 
should be a gap you can see that there
take<00:01:18.909> a<00:01:18.939> sharp<00:01:19.240> knife<00:01:19.319> pass<00:01:20.319> it<00:01:20.530> through<00:01:20.710> and

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
take a sharp knife pass it through and

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.440 
take a sharp knife pass it through and
cut<00:01:22.060> the<00:01:22.240> skin<00:01:22.740> Lane<00:01:23.740> gives<00:01:24.039> you<00:01:24.249> the<00:01:25.090> back<00:01:25.270> and

00:01:31.559 --> 00:01:31.569 
front half back in all the way over if

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:32.789 
front half back in all the way over if
you<00:01:31.749> do<00:01:31.929> get<00:01:32.079> any<00:01:32.139> bits<00:01:32.499> that<00:01:32.649> are<00:01:32.770> sticking

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:32.799 
you do get any bits that are sticking

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:34.679 
you do get any bits that are sticking
just<00:01:33.429> use<00:01:33.609> the<00:01:33.759> knife<00:01:33.909> just<00:01:33.939> to<00:01:34.299> ease<00:01:34.509> them

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:34.689 
just use the knife just to ease them

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:42.870 
just use the knife just to ease them
away<00:01:40.649> this<00:01:41.649> is<00:01:41.829> much<00:01:42.039> easier<00:01:42.069> on<00:01:42.579> fresh

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
away this is much easier on fresh

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.389 
away this is much easier on fresh
rabbits<00:01:43.359> and<00:01:43.810> young<00:01:44.139> rabbits<00:01:44.560> they'll<00:01:45.039> go<00:01:45.279> the

rabbit and the older the rabbit they I
watch<00:01:47.709> this<00:01:47.920> is<00:01:49.109> try<00:01:50.109> and<00:01:50.229> find<00:01:50.409> the<00:01:50.649> joint<00:01:51.490> in

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
watch this is try and find the joint in

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.069 
watch this is try and find the joint in
the<00:01:51.789> elbow<00:01:51.999> there<00:01:52.149> pop<00:01:52.420> your<00:01:52.599> thumb<00:01:52.810> through

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:53.079 
the elbow there pop your thumb through

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:56.849 
the elbow there pop your thumb through
the<00:01:53.170> hole<00:01:54.749> and<00:01:55.749> then<00:01:55.810> now<00:01:56.229> it<00:01:56.289> just<00:01:56.499> creates<00:01:56.770> a

00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:56.859 
the hole and then now it just creates a

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:59.969 
the hole and then now it just creates a
bit<00:01:57.009> for<00:01:57.189> pulling<00:01:57.490> that<00:01:57.520> off<00:01:58.859> don't<00:01:59.859> worry

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
bit for pulling that off don't worry

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:02.389 
bit for pulling that off don't worry
about<00:02:00.159> the<00:02:00.369> skin<00:02:00.609> on<00:02:00.759> there<00:02:00.909> at<00:02:01.029> the<00:02:01.060> moment

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
about the skin on there at the moment

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:08.359 
about the skin on there at the moment
same<00:02:03.399> with<00:02:03.549> this<00:02:03.639> side

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:18.559 

and<00:02:09.000> just<00:02:09.330> pop<00:02:09.720> that<00:02:09.750> off<00:02:17.300> so<00:02:18.300> what<00:02:18.450> you're

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
and just pop that off so what you're

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.320 
and just pop that off so what you're
fighting<00:02:18.840> knows<00:02:19.110> that<00:02:19.379> that's<00:02:19.560> over<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.069> teal

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
fighting knows that that's over the teal

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.550 
fighting knows that that's over the teal
what<00:02:21.330> you<00:02:21.450> can<00:02:21.599> do<00:02:21.720> at<00:02:21.840> this<00:02:21.930> stage<00:02:21.989> is<00:02:22.260> with<00:02:22.530> a

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
what you can do at this stage is with a

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.119 
what you can do at this stage is with a
sharp<00:02:22.860> knife<00:02:23.099> just<00:02:23.129> like<00:02:23.519> a<00:02:23.670> v-shape<00:02:24.239> and

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:25.129 
sharp knife just like a v-shape and

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:29.539 
sharp knife just like a v-shape and
either<00:02:26.129> side<00:02:27.680> what<00:02:28.680> could<00:02:28.890> be<00:02:29.010> down<00:02:29.220> in

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
either side what could be down in

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:37.100 
either side what could be down in
between<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.000> pelvis<00:02:35.390> now<00:02:36.390> if<00:02:36.450> you<00:02:36.629> just<00:02:36.840> pull

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
between the pelvis now if you just pull

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:48.530 
between the pelvis now if you just pull
away<00:02:37.230> with<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.680> teal<00:02:44.959> I<00:02:47.060> will<00:02:48.060> do<00:02:48.180> the<00:02:48.299> front

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
away with the teal I will do the front

00:02:48.540 --> 00:03:00.340 
away with the teal I will do the front
end<00:02:49.099> exactly<00:02:50.099> the<00:02:50.489> same<00:02:50.730> way

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:07.070 

but<00:03:01.350> my<00:03:01.530> fiddle<00:03:01.890> with<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.130> front<00:03:02.340> legs<00:03:06.080> again

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
but my fiddle with the front legs again
