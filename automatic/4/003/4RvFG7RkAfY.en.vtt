00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.250
 today we are celebrating the seventh 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.580
 liberation of Puerto Rican coasts 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.700
 state forest below we released 10 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.259
 individuals this way strategy 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.180
 to increase the population already 

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:19.960
 previously established since 2006 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.939
 up to the pressure 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.369
 this starts in the early morning hours 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:27.220
 all the participants go to the 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:30.039
 different observation points and a 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.619
 group then we went to an area that 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:34.540
 we know as line 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.909
 hiding place where things perceive us 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.410
 our presence opens the classrooms of 

00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:42.079
 release that the variety 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.750
 the secretary on this occasion and then 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:48.489
 wait for them that individuals 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.489
 especially an assisted release 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.420
 We distribute the staff in points of 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.520
 observation this for the great theory 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.920
 once the animals leave the classrooms 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.810
 of release monitor dispersion 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.760
 of these animals documentary 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.970
 specifically if they move alone 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:06.100
 and they stay in the area and if you 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.330
 incorporate the already established flock 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.770
 since 2006 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.540
 in the total forest of gebas 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:18.270
 specifically the population is estimated 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:20.250
 between 57 to plus or minus 110 individuals 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.890
 the difference in these two numbers is 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.390
 that the 57 individuals have proof 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.890
 where are they have check for issuers 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.960
 they have distinctive marks that we can 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.300
 identify them continuously and 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.870
 constant but there are other individuals who 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:35.490
 the transmitters no longer have a battery 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:39.650
 obviously they are dispersing and so 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.650
 we do not know what has happened to him 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:53.220
 next steps to follow obviously is 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:55.320
 maintain existing populations this 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.870
 and handle it in such a way that it has a 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.350
 positive growth in the population that 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:04.760
 increase that crossing and eventually 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:06.560
 establish a third population 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.950
 specifically in the state forest of 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.540
 medicated where we possibly follow the 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.060
 similar elements that were used 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:17.980
 here obviously adapting it to the 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.980
 particular circumstances of the forest 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.830
 the reason and there was no interest in the area
