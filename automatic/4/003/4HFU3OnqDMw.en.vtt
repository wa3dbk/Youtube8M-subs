here<00:00:46.059> I<00:00:46.089> have<00:00:46.510> another<00:00:47.039> USB<00:00:48.089> charger<00:00:49.089> that

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:49.859 
here I have another USB charger that

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:55.110 
here I have another USB charger that
uses<00:00:50.859> the<00:00:51.219> lithium<00:00:52.210> ion<00:00:52.479> battery<00:00:52.989> this<00:00:53.530> is<00:00:54.120> one

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:55.120 
uses the lithium ion battery this is one

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.590 
uses the lithium ion battery this is one
eight<00:00:55.269> six<00:00:56.260> five<00:00:56.530> zero<00:00:57.179> lithium<00:00:58.179> battery

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
eight six five zero lithium battery

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.840 
eight six five zero lithium battery
three<00:00:59.140> point<00:00:59.379> seven<00:00:59.620> volt<00:00:59.800> and<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:02.280> am<00:01:03.280> using

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
three point seven volt and I am using

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.460 
three point seven volt and I am using
this<00:01:04.720> charging<00:01:05.619> port<00:01:06.220> this<00:01:06.640> is<00:01:06.820> a<00:01:07.229> lithium<00:01:08.229> ion

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
this charging port this is a lithium ion

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.969 
this charging port this is a lithium ion
charging<00:01:09.280> port<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:10.689> instead<00:01:11.289> of<00:01:11.439> using<00:01:11.649> the

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
charging port and instead of using the

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:18.870 
charging port and instead of using the
micro<00:01:12.820> USB<00:01:14.460> plug<00:01:15.460> in<00:01:15.700> I<00:01:17.280> change<00:01:18.280> it<00:01:18.460> over<00:01:18.700> to<00:01:18.850> a

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
micro USB plug in I change it over to a

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:25.529 
micro USB plug in I change it over to a
regular<00:01:19.450> USB<00:01:20.789> because<00:01:22.200> this<00:01:23.200> micro<00:01:23.830> USB<00:01:24.539> port

00:01:25.529 --> 00:01:25.539 
regular USB because this micro USB port

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:28.620 
regular USB because this micro USB port
is<00:01:25.869> very<00:01:26.679> flimsy<00:01:27.069> on<00:01:27.580> this<00:01:27.789> particular<00:01:28.179> board

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
is very flimsy on this particular board

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.770 
is very flimsy on this particular board
it's<00:01:29.020> just<00:01:29.409> glued<00:01:29.770> on<00:01:30.009> and<00:01:30.399> if<00:01:31.000> you<00:01:31.149> twist<00:01:31.569> it

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
it's just glued on and if you twist it

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.370 
it's just glued on and if you twist it
the<00:01:31.929> wrong<00:01:32.140> way<00:01:32.170> it<00:01:32.590> comes<00:01:32.799> off<00:01:33.149> so<00:01:34.149> this<00:01:35.049> board

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
the wrong way it comes off so this board

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.279 
the wrong way it comes off so this board
came<00:01:35.649> off<00:01:35.950> this<00:01:36.580> connector<00:01:37.209> came<00:01:37.450> off<00:01:37.720> so<00:01:37.990> I

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:38.289 
came off this connector came off so I

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:44.550 
came off this connector came off so I
just<00:01:39.000> attached<00:01:40.000> a<00:01:41.759> female<00:01:42.759> USB<00:01:43.720> connector

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
just attached a female USB connector

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.080 
just attached a female USB connector
like<00:01:44.770> this<00:01:45.009> to<00:01:45.789> the<00:01:46.750> breadboard<00:01:47.229> and<00:01:47.530> then<00:01:47.740> I

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
like this to the breadboard and then I

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.080 
like this to the breadboard and then I
put<00:01:49.090> the<00:01:49.240> input<00:01:49.689> into<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:51.340> left<00:01:51.700> and<00:01:51.880> right

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
put the input into the left and right

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.389 
put the input into the left and right
here<00:01:52.420> and<00:01:52.689> then<00:01:52.869> this<00:01:53.799> thing<00:01:54.070> still<00:01:54.369> works

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
here and then this thing still works

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:57.929 
here and then this thing still works
that's<00:01:54.939> why<00:01:55.799> it's<00:01:56.799> a<00:01:56.920> shame<00:01:57.159> for<00:01:57.520> me<00:01:57.640> to<00:01:57.759> throw

00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:57.939 
that's why it's a shame for me to throw

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:00.419 
that's why it's a shame for me to throw
it<00:01:58.119> now<00:01:58.210> even<00:01:58.570> though<00:01:58.689> is<00:01:58.869> just<00:01:59.109> maybe<00:01:59.799> like<00:02:00.100> a

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:00.429 
it now even though is just maybe like a

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:04.830 
it now even though is just maybe like a
dollar<00:02:01.140> fifty<00:02:02.140> or<00:02:02.350> or<00:02:02.590> less<00:02:02.829> and<00:02:03.570> then<00:02:04.570> the

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
dollar fifty or or less and then the

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.779 
dollar fifty or or less and then the
second<00:02:05.380> part<00:02:05.530> of<00:02:05.820> this<00:02:06.820> USB<00:02:07.390> charger<00:02:08.140> is<00:02:08.789> this

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
second part of this USB charger is this

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.380 
second part of this USB charger is this
is<00:02:10.000> the<00:02:10.539> output<00:02:10.750> and<00:02:11.640> this<00:02:12.640> is<00:02:12.700> the<00:02:12.850> port<00:02:13.269> that

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
is the output and this is the port that

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.940 
is the output and this is the port that
I'm<00:02:13.570> using<00:02:14.670> this<00:02:15.670> is<00:02:15.730> where<00:02:16.060> you<00:02:16.180> plug<00:02:16.359> the

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
I'm using this is where you plug the

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.930 
I'm using this is where you plug the
female<00:02:17.950> USB<00:02:18.670> connector<00:02:19.239> and<00:02:19.799> then<00:02:20.799> your<00:02:21.430> input

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
female USB connector and then your input

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.349 
female USB connector and then your input
is<00:02:22.060> here<00:02:22.299> positive<00:02:22.630> negative<00:02:23.170> and<00:02:24.150> this<00:02:25.150> is<00:02:25.329> a

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:25.359 
is here positive negative and this is a

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:28.319 
is here positive negative and this is a
voltage<00:02:25.989> booster<00:02:26.320> you<00:02:27.190> can<00:02:27.400> input<00:02:27.730> one<00:02:28.000> volt

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:28.329 
voltage booster you can input one volt

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:33.210 
voltage booster you can input one volt
and<00:02:28.540> it<00:02:29.160> boosts<00:02:30.160> it<00:02:30.250> up<00:02:30.370> to<00:02:30.640> five<00:02:31.180> volt<00:02:32.069> so<00:02:33.069> the

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
and it boosts it up to five volt so the

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.240 
and it boosts it up to five volt so the
wiring<00:02:33.819> is<00:02:34.030> for<00:02:34.930> a<00:02:34.959> switch<00:02:35.290> is<00:02:35.530> pretty<00:02:35.890> simple

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250

which mode you're in when you switch it
up<00:03:01.160> to<00:03:01.370> this<00:03:01.550> side<00:03:01.820> this<00:03:02.000> would<00:03:02.240> be<00:03:02.390> charging

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
up to this side this would be charging

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.180 
up to this side this would be charging
and<00:03:03.860> when<00:03:04.220> you<00:03:04.340> switch<00:03:04.670> it<00:03:04.850> to<00:03:05.060> this<00:03:05.540> side<00:03:06.190> this

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
and when you switch it to this side this

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.620 
and when you switch it to this side this
would<00:03:07.520> come<00:03:07.730> on<00:03:07.960> the<00:03:09.250> voltage<00:03:10.330> boosting<00:03:11.330> part

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
would come on the voltage boosting part

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.320 
would come on the voltage boosting part
or<00:03:11.870> the<00:03:12.260> output<00:03:12.710> part<00:03:13.040> so<00:03:13.880> when<00:03:14.180> you

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
or the output part so when you

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:20.260 
or the output part so when you
disconnect<00:03:15.050> the<00:03:15.790> USB<00:03:18.070> this<00:03:19.070> would<00:03:19.370> be<00:03:19.610> the

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.270 
disconnect the USB this would be the

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.230 
disconnect the USB this would be the
only<00:03:20.300> part<00:03:20.810> the<00:03:21.770> or<00:03:22.040> the<00:03:22.220> only<00:03:22.370> port<00:03:22.760> that<00:03:22.970> will

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:23.240 
only part the or the only port that will

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.040 
only part the or the only port that will
be<00:03:23.450> long

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
be long

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.880 
be long
this<00:03:24.560> won't<00:03:24.860> be<00:03:24.950> on<00:03:25.870> and<00:03:26.870> when<00:03:27.560> you're<00:03:27.709> not

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
this won't be on and when you're not

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:33.180 
this won't be on and when you're not
using<00:03:28.220> the<00:03:28.790> USB<00:03:29.510> when<00:03:30.500> you<00:03:30.620> switch<00:03:30.950> it<00:03:31.130> back<00:03:31.310> to

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
using the USB when you switch it back to

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.479 
using the USB when you switch it back to
here<00:03:34.630> the<00:03:35.630> battery<00:03:36.110> would<00:03:36.470> be<00:03:36.530> disconnected

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
here the battery would be disconnected

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:40.810 
here the battery would be disconnected
from<00:03:38.120> the<00:03:38.390> sport<00:03:38.840> so<00:03:39.680> there<00:03:40.459> would<00:03:40.640> be<00:03:40.670> no

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
from the sport so there would be no

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:45.010 
from the sport so there would be no
drain<00:03:41.300> because<00:03:41.810> if<00:03:42.380> you<00:03:43.150> have<00:03:44.150> power<00:03:44.420> to<00:03:44.840> this

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.020 
drain because if you have power to this

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.560 
drain because if you have power to this
port<00:03:45.380> there<00:03:45.560> would<00:03:45.770> be<00:03:45.800> a<00:03:46.220> little<00:03:46.640> parasitic

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:47.570 
port there would be a little parasitic

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:52.090 
port there would be a little parasitic
drain<00:03:47.900> I<00:03:49.540> tested<00:03:50.540> it<00:03:50.600> before<00:03:50.810> and<00:03:51.290> it<00:03:51.739> seems<00:03:51.950> to

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
drain I tested it before and it seems to

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:58.810 
drain I tested it before and it seems to
work<00:03:52.250> and<00:03:55.959> when<00:03:56.959> I<00:03:57.110> had<00:03:57.380> one<00:03:57.739> double-a<00:03:58.340> battery

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.820 
work and when I had one double-a battery

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.780 
work and when I had one double-a battery
connected<00:03:59.420> to<00:03:59.570> the<00:03:59.660> board<00:03:59.959> here<00:04:00.280> it<00:04:01.280> kind<00:04:01.640> of

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
connected to the board here it kind of

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.030 
connected to the board here it kind of
worked<00:04:02.030> but<00:04:02.239> not<00:04:02.450> always<00:04:02.780> because<00:04:03.080> maybe<00:04:03.769> the

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
worked but not always because maybe the

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:11.530 
worked but not always because maybe the
output<00:04:04.459> was<00:04:04.640> too<00:04:04.910> low<00:04:05.180> and<00:04:10.000> okay<00:04:11.000> now<00:04:11.510> I

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
output was too low and okay now I

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:17.070 
output was too low and okay now I
connected<00:04:12.200> it<00:04:12.290> let's<00:04:12.680> switch<00:04:13.160> it<00:04:13.370> to<00:04:14.140> power<00:04:15.140> on

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:17.080 
connected it let's switch it to power on

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:23.730 
connected it let's switch it to power on
okay<00:04:18.080> and<00:04:19.070> you<00:04:20.000> can<00:04:20.180> see<00:04:20.450> is<00:04:20.570> charging<00:04:21.500> my<00:04:21.709> iPod

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
okay and you can see is charging my iPod

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:30.310 
okay and you can see is charging my iPod
okay<00:04:27.370> I'm<00:04:28.370> sure<00:04:28.610> it<00:04:28.820> will<00:04:29.000> work<00:04:29.060> too<00:04:29.660> if<00:04:30.020> you

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
okay I'm sure it will work too if you

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.820 
okay I'm sure it will work too if you
have<00:04:30.590> two<00:04:31.310> AAA<00:04:31.910> batteries<00:04:32.900> instead<00:04:33.410> of<00:04:33.560> one

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
have two AAA batteries instead of one

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.360 
have two AAA batteries instead of one
the<00:04:34.479> voltage<00:04:35.479> boosting<00:04:36.020> is<00:04:36.169> from<00:04:36.530> one<00:04:36.800> volt<00:04:37.100> if

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
the voltage boosting is from one volt if

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.600 
the voltage boosting is from one volt if
I<00:04:37.520> pull<00:04:37.880> you<00:04:38.120> cannot<00:04:38.590> down<00:04:39.590> convert<00:04:40.100> you

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
I pull you cannot down convert you

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.570 
I pull you cannot down convert you
cannot<00:04:40.880> put<00:04:41.150> in<00:04:41.270> six<00:04:41.510> volt<00:04:41.890> so<00:04:42.890> you're<00:04:43.490> not

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
cannot put in six volt so you're not

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:47.469 
cannot put in six volt so you're not
supposed<00:04:43.910> to<00:04:44.030> do<00:04:44.180> that<00:04:44.390> but<00:04:45.790> three<00:04:46.790> volts<00:04:47.180> for

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:47.479 
supposed to do that but three volts for

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:48.730 
supposed to do that but three volts for
folks<00:04:47.840> is<00:04:48.110> fine

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
folks is fine

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.680 
folks is fine
two<00:04:49.220> volts<00:04:49.610> is<00:04:49.760> fine<00:04:50.060> one<00:04:50.960> is<00:04:50.990> fine<00:04:52.330> let's<00:04:53.330> find

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
two volts is fine one is fine let's find

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:58.530 
two volts is fine one is fine let's find
the<00:04:53.930> cable<00:04:54.400> connector<00:04:55.510> my<00:04:56.510> century-old<00:04:57.110> phone
