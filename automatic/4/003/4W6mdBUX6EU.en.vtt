00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.480
 [Music] 

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:04.480
 Y 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:16.239
 i 

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:16.239
 [Music] 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.779
 the materials that we need to 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.689
 make our Christmas wreath are a 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.790
 sweet crown silicone gun and 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:27.250
 spheres of many colors sizes and 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.410
 textures 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.900
 I'm going to start hitting the spheres more 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.480
 great I'm just going to put 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.760
 enough silicon where has the 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.620
 tip to hang 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:44.780
 and the 20th 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:47.469
 in the numbers 6 12 3 and 9 imagining that 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.469
 this is a watch 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:01.460
 I'm going to take my medium spheres and I'm going to 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:04.309
 place three in each space between 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.730
 wait and wait big I will put a 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.330
 up here 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.580
 [Music] 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.510
 and the other two I'm going to stick 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.510
 down here 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:19.890
 [Music] 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.500
 go alternating the colors of the 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.950
 way they like it if they are not 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.170
 insurance do a simulation before 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.150
 paste them to see how it will look and if 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.420
 they do not like to just change it 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.420
 position 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:59.070
 [Music] 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.950
 and with the smaller spheres we are going to 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.409
 go filling the empty spaces 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.409
 [Music] 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:14.110
 [Music] 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.570
 I recommend that before you start 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.760
 paste the spheres paint your base a 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:21.460
 color as gold or of some color that 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.770
 combine with your spheres so that if you 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.080
 there are spaces do not see the unicel 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.240
 White 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:31.010
 I should have done this step before 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.010
 but the truth is that it happened to me 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.379
 Do not forget to also paint all the 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.959
 banks of gold or color more 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:40.030
 dry and have selected to give a 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.709
 volume effect and finish filling 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.210
 our spaces like these that are 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:48.090
 here we are going to take our sphere 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:51.870
 we are going to put the silicon a little bit 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:54.950
 above no longer where it hangs up to 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.950
 start to overpower the 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.469
 [Music] 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:08.980
 We can use the remaining spheres 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.430
 to fill in the spaces that we have 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.430
 outside 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:18.200
 and so we will continue filling 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:20.540
 our crown 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.890
 to finish we are going to take a bit 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.730
 of the ribbon 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:28.320
 we are going to do it this way we are going to 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:33.730
 put a silicon droplet to stick it 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:36.400
 [Music] 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.739
 and we 're going to hit it here back so that 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.080
 we can hang our crown and now 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:44.730
 we have our crown ready if you 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:47.099
 they decide they can put a bow 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.260
 to finish the crown and this 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:51.620
 ready to hang it where you 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.620
 want 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.850
 If you liked this idea, do not forget

 subscribe to the channel on the red button of 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.000
 down here where it says subscribe for 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.130
 that every time we are more and more in the 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.200
 sweetest channel remember that you can 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.210
 follow by facebook and by twitter 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:14.040
 I am Dani and see you next Monday 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:14.040
 in the next video bye bye
