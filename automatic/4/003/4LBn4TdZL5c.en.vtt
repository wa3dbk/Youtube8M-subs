accidentally<00:00:17.100> said<00:00:17.369> we<00:00:17.520> were<00:00:17.609> up<00:00:17.670> to<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:17.850> path

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
accidentally said we were up to the path

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.609 
accidentally said we were up to the path
of<00:00:18.240> knowledge<00:00:18.660> in<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.840> last<00:00:19.080> one<00:00:19.289> before

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
of knowledge in the last one before

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.040 
of knowledge in the last one before
knowledge<00:00:20.039> is<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.400> quest<00:00:20.640> after<00:00:20.880> this<00:00:21.449> so

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
knowledge is the quest after this so

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.540 
knowledge is the quest after this so
don't<00:00:22.199> do<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.529> path<00:00:22.680> of<00:00:22.830> knowledge<00:00:23.100> just<00:00:23.130> yet

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
don't do the path of knowledge just yet

souls<00:00:25.699> the<00:00:26.699> storms<00:00:27.119> no<00:00:27.510> this<00:00:28.080> is<00:00:28.230> an<00:00:28.349> easy

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
souls the storms no this is an easy

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.290 
souls the storms no this is an easy
enough<00:00:28.710> quest<00:00:29.010> it's<00:00:29.189> gonna<00:00:29.310> take<00:00:29.580> about<00:00:29.789> 20

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
enough quest it's gonna take about 20

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.370 
enough quest it's gonna take about 20
minutes<00:00:30.330> and<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.840> reason<00:00:31.080> for<00:00:31.140> that<00:00:31.199> is

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
minutes and the reason for that is

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.100 
minutes and the reason for that is
because<00:00:31.410> these<00:00:32.009> storms<00:00:32.640> are<00:00:32.870> sprinkled<00:00:33.870> all

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
because these storms are sprinkled all

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.020 
because these storms are sprinkled all
over<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.739> map<00:00:34.980> see<00:00:35.250> there<00:00:35.460> we<00:00:35.579> are<00:00:35.610> there<00:00:35.850> with

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
over the map see there we are there with

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.330 
over the map see there we are there with
the<00:00:36.120> system<00:00:36.420> saw<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:37.110> Sun<00:00:37.320> storm<00:00:37.680> but<00:00:38.160> then<00:00:38.250> if

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
the system saw the Sun storm but then if

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.520 
the system saw the Sun storm but then if
you<00:00:38.460> look<00:00:38.640> here<00:00:38.940> like<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.390> earth<00:00:39.600> storm<00:00:40.079> it's

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
you look here like the earth storm it's

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.869 
you look here like the earth storm it's
at<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.739> other<00:00:40.829> end<00:00:41.010> of<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.160> map<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.550> these

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
at the other end of the map and these

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.580 
at the other end of the map and these
places<00:00:42.210> are<00:00:42.450> really<00:00:42.899> high<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.350> mean<00:00:43.469> you're

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
places are really high I mean you're

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.709 
places are really high I mean you're
gonna<00:00:43.680> run<00:00:43.950> through<00:00:44.160> them<00:00:44.280> all<00:00:44.399> so<00:00:45.000> it<00:00:45.180> just<00:00:45.360> it

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
gonna run through them all so it just it

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.240 
gonna run through them all so it just it
takes<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:46.079> while<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.289> run<00:00:46.559> to<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.739> location<00:00:47.160> so

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
takes a while to run to the location so

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.590 
takes a while to run to the location so
I'm<00:00:47.309> gonna<00:00:47.399> cleanse<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.850> storms<00:00:48.300> show<00:00:48.480> you

the<00:00:55.739> next<00:00:55.890> video<00:00:56.219> part<00:00:56.579> 5<00:00:56.969> we're<00:00:57.690> gonna<00:00:57.960> do<00:00:58.289> the

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
the next video part 5 we're gonna do the

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.830 
the next video part 5 we're gonna do the
path<00:00:59.370> of<00:00:59.640> knowledge<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.329> then<00:01:00.480> after<00:01:00.719> that

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
path of knowledge and then after that

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.349 
path of knowledge and then after that
we've<00:01:01.020> got<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.640> gardener<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.670> men<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.210> then

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
we've got the gardener of men and then

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.320 
we've got the gardener of men and then
at<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.809> summit<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.500> proof<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:05.040> propia<00:01:05.760> which

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
at the summit of a proof of propia which

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.320 
at the summit of a proof of propia which
is<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.659> final<00:01:07.049> quest<00:01:07.350> can<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:07.680> believe<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.330> so

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
is the final quest can you believe it so

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.149 
is the final quest can you believe it so
soon<00:01:09.659> I<00:01:09.990> guess<00:01:10.409> that's<00:01:10.590> why<00:01:10.740> they've<00:01:10.950> did<00:01:11.100> a

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
soon I guess that's why they've did a

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.609 
soon I guess that's why they've did a
50%<00:01:11.670> discount<00:01:12.170> right<00:01:13.170> here<00:01:13.380> we<00:01:13.439> go<00:01:13.590> let's

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
50% discount right here we go let's

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.899 
50% discount right here we go let's
cleanse<00:01:14.100> this<00:01:14.430> storm<00:01:15.200> and<00:01:16.280> that<00:01:17.280> stone<00:01:17.640> is

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
cleanse this storm and that stone is

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.510 
cleanse this storm and that stone is
being<00:01:18.180> cleansed<00:01:18.479> as<00:01:18.780> we<00:01:18.930> speak<00:01:19.290> like<00:01:20.220> I<00:01:20.310> said

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
being cleansed as we speak like I said

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.789 
being cleansed as we speak like I said
earlier<00:01:20.970> my<00:01:21.180> dragon<00:01:21.570> shouts<00:01:21.780> will<00:01:22.110> not<00:01:22.290> reset

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
earlier my dragon shouts will not reset

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.510 
earlier my dragon shouts will not reset
him<00:01:23.070> so<00:01:23.759> it<00:01:24.420> looks<00:01:24.659> like<00:01:24.990> they<00:01:25.259> have<00:01:25.590> done<00:01:25.619> well

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
him so it looks like they have done well

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.710 
him so it looks like they have done well
we've<00:01:26.729> got<00:01:26.850> another<00:01:27.000> one<00:01:27.090> ease<00:01:27.270> bully<00:01:27.479> thing

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
we've got another one ease bully thing

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.690 
we've got another one ease bully thing
so<00:01:28.140> hopefully<00:01:28.590> maybe<00:01:28.770> I'll<00:01:28.979> get<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.340> see<00:01:29.579> what

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
so hopefully maybe I'll get to see what

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.190 
so hopefully maybe I'll get to see what
he's<00:01:29.790> carrying<00:01:29.970> this<00:01:30.270> time<00:01:30.450> but<00:01:30.900> I'll<00:01:31.020> blow

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
he's carrying this time but I'll blow

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
as much as these guys I got one more

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.260 
as much as these guys I got one more
stone<00:04:21.870> after<00:04:22.140> this<00:04:22.440> and<00:04:22.789> then<00:04:23.789> we<00:04:23.910> should<00:04:23.970> be

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.439 
on the quest the path of knowledge

00:04:29.439 --> 00:04:29.449 
I think it's a bit late to say this if

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:31.480 
I think it's a bit late to say this if
any<00:04:29.780> newcomers<00:04:30.319> are<00:04:30.410> watching<00:04:30.710> the<00:04:30.800> video<00:04:31.039> but

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550
