00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.009
 ladies and gentlemen good afternoon with you 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.490
 again Alexander Levitas 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.440
 site levitas dot ru this time out 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.969
 Almaty 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.030
 sculpture apple behind my back is 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.160
 unofficial symbol of the city the thing is 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.880
 that alma-ata all the time got its name 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.109
 precisely in honor of apples in honor of apple trees 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.449
 gardens around the city 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:28.080
 the name alma-ata can be translated 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.480
 like a grandfather an apple 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.250
 Ireland is another sculpture 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.950
 dedicated to another fruit rather 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.899
 another vegetables there is a monument 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.250
 admiral volter reilly 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:43.469
 who holds potatoes in his hand 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.860
 It would seem a strange combination of military 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.820
 sailor 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.370
 and suddenly the potato thing is that the Irish 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.989
 during the heyday of the British Empire 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.320
 for a long time lived half starving 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:58.500
 due to the fact that children were born a lot 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.870
 here is the land in ireland the poor will give birth badly 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.300
 wheat rye other cereals grow there 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.519
 very bad so the Irish lived 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:10.560
 starving and dying of hunger nobody 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:14.010
 surprised but Volter or first brought in 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.229
 ireland potatoes which started to give 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.930
 much more harvest on well 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.390
 caught on local soils she gave 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:25.320
 much tenfold 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.420
 harvest than cereals and eventually stewed 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.070
 potatoes become traditional irish 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.950
 dish hunger stopped 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.490
