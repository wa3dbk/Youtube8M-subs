00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
I've been have a little dust on the

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.270 
I've been have a little dust on the
bottom<00:02:34.200> I've<00:02:34.350> been<00:02:34.500> wearing<00:02:34.770> these<00:02:34.980> around

bottom I've been wearing these around
the<00:02:35.460> house<00:02:35.670> just<00:02:36.300> kind<00:02:36.480> of<00:02:36.540> strutting<00:02:36.840> around

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
the house just kind of strutting around

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.170 
the house just kind of strutting around
in<00:02:37.290> them<00:02:37.440> dancing<00:02:37.950> in<00:02:38.070> them<00:02:38.190> just<00:02:38.730> to<00:02:38.970> break

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
in them dancing in them just to break

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.720 
in them dancing in them just to break
them<00:02:39.450> in<00:02:39.780> these<00:02:40.320> shoes<00:02:40.710> are<00:02:41.070> actually

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
them in these shoes are actually

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.210 
them in these shoes are actually
comfortable<00:02:42.090> I<00:02:42.570> know<00:02:42.870> sometimes<00:02:43.650> with<00:02:43.860> heels

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
comfortable I know sometimes with heels

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.560 
comfortable I know sometimes with heels
we<00:02:44.520> feel<00:02:44.760> like<00:02:44.910> they're<00:02:45.090> not<00:02:45.240> going<00:02:45.360> to<00:02:45.450> be

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
we feel like they're not going to be

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.380 
we feel like they're not going to be
comfortable<00:02:45.960> now<00:02:46.500> in<00:02:46.650> my<00:02:46.860> opinion<00:02:46.890> I<00:02:47.580> like<00:02:48.000> a

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
comfortable now in my opinion I like a

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.270 
comfortable now in my opinion I like a
heel<00:02:48.720> between<00:02:49.110> three<00:02:49.320> and<00:02:49.380> four<00:02:49.710> inches<00:02:50.040> I

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
heel between three and four inches I

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.400 
heel between three and four inches I
always<00:02:50.970> calculate<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:51.870> difference<00:02:52.020> between

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
always calculate the difference between

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.040 
always calculate the difference between
the<00:02:52.800> platform<00:02:53.310> and<00:02:53.520> the<00:02:53.580> heel<00:02:54.300> so<00:02:54.630> I<00:02:54.690> can<00:02:54.960> get

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
the platform and the heel so I can get

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.110 
the platform and the heel so I can get
the<00:02:55.230> true<00:02:55.530> heel<00:02:55.860> height<00:02:56.130> and<00:02:56.340> how<00:02:56.460> are<00:02:56.670> walking

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
the true heel height and how are walking

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.300 
the true heel height and how are walking
it<00:02:57.240> so<00:02:57.810> yeah<00:02:57.990> these<00:02:58.230> are<00:02:58.290> simplicity<00:02:59.130> and

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
it so yeah these are simplicity and

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.090 
it so yeah these are simplicity and
these<00:02:59.940> are<00:03:00.240> really<00:03:00.600> this<00:03:01.050> is<00:03:01.230> really<00:03:01.500> a<00:03:01.680> pretty

really<00:06:38.280> try<00:06:38.550> a<00:06:38.580> shoe<00:06:38.910> on<00:06:38.940> more<00:06:39.420> on<00:06:39.600> their<00:06:39.810> left

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:40.050 
really try a shoe on more on their left

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:42.380 
really try a shoe on more on their left
foot<00:06:40.230> then<00:06:40.440> on<00:06:40.590> there<00:06:40.830> right<00:06:41.070> initially<00:06:41.790> but

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:42.390 
foot then on there right initially but

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:44.660 
foot then on there right initially but
for<00:06:42.660> me<00:06:42.810> usually<00:06:43.110> the<00:06:43.500> right<00:06:43.680> shoe<00:06:44.010> is<00:06:44.220> just<00:06:44.490> a

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:44.670 
for me usually the right shoe is just a

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:46.730 
for me usually the right shoe is just a
little<00:06:44.910> bit<00:06:45.210> tighter<00:06:45.540> than<00:06:45.780> the<00:06:45.840> left<00:06:46.200> then

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:46.740 
little bit tighter than the left then

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:48.290 
little bit tighter than the left then
again<00:06:47.010> it<00:06:47.190> could<00:06:47.220> be<00:06:47.400> that<00:06:47.670> there's<00:06:47.880> a<00:06:47.940> little

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:48.300 
again it could be that there's a little

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:49.880 
again it could be that there's a little
bit<00:06:48.420> of<00:06:48.450> size<00:06:48.690> difference<00:06:49.170> between<00:06:49.500> my<00:06:49.620> left

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:49.890
