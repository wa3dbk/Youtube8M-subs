00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
first seven days of the challenge now if

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.619 
first seven days of the challenge now if
you're<00:00:40.829> exercising<00:00:41.370> then<00:00:42.059> you<00:00:42.239> would<00:00:42.420> go

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
you're exercising then you would go

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.500 
you're exercising then you would go
ahead<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:43.170> actually<00:00:43.350> continue<00:00:44.129> exercising

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
ahead and actually continue exercising

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.450 
ahead and actually continue exercising
until<00:00:45.510> we<00:00:45.629> start<00:00:45.870> touching<00:00:46.260> on<00:00:46.379> it<00:00:46.500> when<00:00:47.430> we

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
until we start touching on it when we

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.500 
until we start touching on it when we
get<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.820> that<00:00:47.940> point<00:00:48.180> where<00:00:48.390> we<00:00:48.480> actually

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
get to that point where we actually

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.410 
get to that point where we actually
introduce<00:00:49.410> exercise<00:00:50.010> we<00:00:50.910> meet<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.149> person

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
introduce exercise we meet a person

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.660 
introduce exercise we meet a person
where<00:00:51.660> they're<00:00:51.870> so<00:00:52.350> if<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.770> person<00:00:53.129> can't<00:00:53.399> walk

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670

someone's gonna walk or using an

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.759 
someone's gonna walk or using an
elliptical<00:01:03.329> type<00:01:03.629> of<00:01:03.780> machine<00:01:04.110> sure<00:01:04.439> we're

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
elliptical type of machine sure we're

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.140 
elliptical type of machine sure we're
going<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:04.920> give<00:01:05.070> them<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.369> guidelines<00:01:05.880> on<00:01:06.030> how

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
going to give them the guidelines on how

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.880 
going to give them the guidelines on how
to<00:01:06.180> make<00:01:06.510> that<00:01:06.659> work<00:01:06.720> for<00:01:07.229> them<00:01:07.380> to<00:01:07.680> maximize

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
to make that work for them to maximize

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.399 
to make that work for them to maximize
fat<00:01:08.400> loss<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:09.000> then<00:01:09.360> everything<00:01:09.810> is<00:01:09.930> based<00:01:10.200> on

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
fat loss and then everything is based on

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.770 
fat loss and then everything is based on
12<00:01:10.830> minutes<00:01:11.159> of<00:01:11.280> sustained<00:01:11.640> activity<00:01:11.880> which

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
12 minutes of sustained activity which

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.570 
12 minutes of sustained activity which
what<00:01:13.170> we<00:01:13.350> know<00:01:13.560> is<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:13.950> whenever<00:01:14.430> you're

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
what we know is that whenever you're

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.280 
what we know is that whenever you're
able<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.820> do<00:01:14.970> 12<00:01:15.360> minutes<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:15.900> sustained

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
able to do 12 minutes of sustained

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.620 
able to do 12 minutes of sustained
activity<00:01:16.530> okay<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.490> increase<00:01:17.909> fat<00:01:18.270> burning

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
activity okay you increase fat burning

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.260 
activity okay you increase fat burning
enzymes<00:01:18.689> which<00:01:19.290> means<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:20.310> maximize<00:01:20.880> fat

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
enzymes which means you maximize fat

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.570 
enzymes which means you maximize fat
loss<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.840> so<00:01:22.470> we<00:01:22.590> touched<00:01:22.860> on<00:01:22.979> all<00:01:23.220> of<00:01:23.430> that

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
loss and so we touched on all of that

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.820 
loss and so we touched on all of that
and<00:01:23.820> then<00:01:24.090> we<00:01:24.750> actually<00:01:24.990> challenged<00:01:25.680> people

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
and then we actually challenged people

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.130 
and then we actually challenged people
so<00:01:26.490> someone's<00:01:27.090> watching<00:01:27.450> this<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:27.900> they<00:01:27.960> say

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
so someone's watching this and they say

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.870 
so someone's watching this and they say
I'm<00:01:28.290> in<00:01:28.320> great<00:01:28.740> shape<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.369> know<00:01:29.670> how<00:01:29.820> to
