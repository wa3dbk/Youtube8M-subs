00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:08.540
 actually 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.180
 today we could compete as if they have to 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.100
 compete and we win 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.900
 and do it 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.730
 our limitations with our 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.670
 defects with our virtues what 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.550
 we can do today team competed well 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:25.580
 they let me do it 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.919
 accounting that is an accomplished fact 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.189
 what we live what we talk about where 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:30.189
 everyone 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:39.020
 how are children in that part of me 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.020
 neck in the maximum and July 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:49.200
 a very important big effort and we 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:49.200
 reach to be jumping with happiness 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.880
 sadness 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.200
 the obligatory ones 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.690
 see you miss 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.990
 it is a very difficult and complicated moment 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:12.150
 I'm not thinking more than feeling what 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.150
 that I feel is a very big pain 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:19.070
 we'll talk 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.070
 follow 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:26.850
 until the end we always talk about the 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.950
 things that were happening and at least 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.490
 for us to which I insist many 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.260
 limiting many virtues all 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.590
 defects we always try to hide them 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:40.250
 but always delivered 100% we do not 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.250
 will finally reach 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.890
 and process them 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.880
 maybe with the illusion that we have 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:52.340
 all conference before a division but 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.630
 beyond that at least partly by 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.280
 part of all the players and 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.280
 directives we always put our 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.960
 not fair that sports the 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.960
 budgets
