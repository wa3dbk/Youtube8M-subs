00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
bringing Star Wars into it I think is a

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.589 
bringing Star Wars into it I think is a
huge<00:00:21.810> thing<00:00:22.199> for<00:00:22.619> us<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:23.789> fans<00:00:24.060> alike<00:00:26.570> but<00:00:27.570> I

huge thing for us and fans alike but I

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.200 
huge thing for us and fans alike but I
would<00:00:28.080> just<00:00:28.260> say<00:00:28.320> in<00:00:29.250> general<00:00:29.310> qualitative

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
would just say in general qualitative

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.330 
would just say in general qualitative
improvement<00:00:30.330> across<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.679> board<00:00:31.859> I<00:00:32.070> think<00:00:32.250> we

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
improvement across the board I think we

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.060 
improvement across the board I think we
added<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:32.940> lot<00:00:33.510> of<00:00:33.570> quality<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.290> all<00:00:34.770> the

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
added a lot of quality and all the

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.380 
added a lot of quality and all the
mechanics<00:00:35.489> that<00:00:35.550> we<00:00:35.700> tried<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:36.000> get<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.149> this

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
mechanics that we tried to get to this

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.780 
mechanics that we tried to get to this
year<00:00:36.739> some<00:00:37.739> of<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.890> things<00:00:38.070> I'm<00:00:38.250> most<00:00:38.280> proud

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
year some of the things I'm most proud

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.850 
year some of the things I'm most proud
of<00:00:38.910> is<00:00:39.390> some<00:00:39.719> of<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.870> breath<00:00:40.110> that<00:00:40.680> we're

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
of is some of the breath that we're

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.299 
of is some of the breath that we're
adding<00:00:41.070> so<00:00:41.820> i<00:00:41.850> would<00:00:42.210> say<00:00:42.420> that<00:00:42.750> there's<00:00:43.739> more

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
adding so i would say that there's more

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.340 
adding so i would say that there's more
types<00:00:44.610> of<00:00:44.760> gameplay<00:00:45.090> in<00:00:45.210> here<00:00:45.420> for<00:00:45.570> more<00:00:45.750> types

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
types of gameplay in here for more types

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.360 
types of gameplay in here for more types
of<00:00:46.500> gamers<00:00:46.850> than<00:00:47.850> we've<00:00:48.570> ever<00:00:48.629> had<00:00:48.930> so<00:00:49.350> i<00:00:49.649> gave

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
of gamers than we've ever had so i gave

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.369 
of gamers than we've ever had so i gave
you<00:00:50.610> three<00:00:50.820> answers<00:00:51.149> but<00:00:51.390> just<00:00:52.050> one<00:00:52.230> is

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
you three answers but just one is

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.049 
you three answers but just one is
startling<00:00:52.770> i<00:00:53.239> would<00:00:54.239> say<00:00:54.449> for<00:00:54.480> me<00:00:54.809> it's<00:00:54.989> the

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
startling i would say for me it's the

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.299 
startling i would say for me it's the
lightsaber<00:00:57.059> combat<00:00:57.270> stuff<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:58.309> everything

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
lightsaber combat stuff and everything

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.319 
lightsaber combat stuff and everything
that<00:00:59.910> our<00:01:00.949> teams<00:01:01.949> at<00:01:02.219> both<00:01:02.430> avalanche<00:01:03.059> and

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
that our teams at both avalanche and

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.840 
that our teams at both avalanche and
Ninja<00:01:03.570> Theory<00:01:03.780> have<00:01:04.019> done<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.589> rewrite<00:01:05.580> the

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
Ninja Theory have done to rewrite the

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.179 
Ninja Theory have done to rewrite the
combat<00:01:06.270> engine<00:01:06.600> inside<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:07.049> infinity<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:07.740> I

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
combat engine inside of infinity and I

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.050 
combat engine inside of infinity and I
don't<00:01:08.340> know<00:01:08.430> if<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:08.580> came<00:01:08.700> through<00:01:08.939> in<00:01:09.030> the

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
don't know if it came through in the

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.580 
don't know if it came through in the
presentation<00:01:09.570> but<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:09.960> think<00:01:10.229> it's<00:01:10.320> really

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
presentation but I think it's really

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.190 
presentation but I think it's really
important<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.250> point<00:01:11.520> out<00:01:11.700> that<00:01:12.000> all<00:01:12.750> of<00:01:13.049> those

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
important to point out that all of those

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.340 
important to point out that all of those
upgrades<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:14.010> that<00:01:14.159> system<00:01:14.670> carry<00:01:15.180> across<00:01:15.540> all

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
upgrades to that system carry across all

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.390 
upgrades to that system carry across all
of<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:17.009> Disney<00:01:17.189> infinity<00:01:17.490> figures<00:01:18.740> so<00:01:19.740> when

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
of the Disney infinity figures so when

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.539 
of the Disney infinity figures so when
you<00:01:20.520> saw<00:01:20.850> for<00:01:21.420> example<00:01:21.450> like<00:01:22.080> Sully<00:01:22.830> air

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
you saw for example like Sully air

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.359 
you saw for example like Sully air
juggling<00:01:24.270> i<00:01:24.509> think<00:01:25.350> was<00:01:25.470> an<00:01:25.590> Agrabah<00:01:26.040> guard

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369

one point out his all of his combo is

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.880 
one point out his all of his combo is
everything<00:01:39.600> changed<00:01:40.079> now<00:01:40.229> because<00:01:40.590> of<00:01:40.619> the

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
everything changed now because of the

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.740 
everything changed now because of the
system<00:01:41.310> wide<00:01:41.490> upgrade<00:01:41.520> that<00:01:42.000> we<00:01:42.090> did<00:01:42.299> bringing

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
system wide upgrade that we did bringing

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.749 
system wide upgrade that we did bringing
new<00:01:42.990> value<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.590> those<00:01:43.740> older<00:01:44.100> characters<00:01:44.549> I

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
new value to those older characters I

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.870 
new value to those older characters I
think<00:01:45.299> that<00:01:45.329> that's<00:01:45.570> something<00:01:45.930> that<00:01:46.880> that

kind of get them all inside of that pack

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.170 
kind of get them all inside of that pack
now<00:03:44.860> we<00:03:44.980> can<00:03:45.130> change<00:03:45.370> it<00:03:45.520> up<00:03:45.640> and<00:03:45.820> do<00:03:45.940> like<00:03:46.150> a

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
now we can change it up and do like a

now we can change it up and do like a
vehicle's<00:03:46.690> pack<00:03:47.230> and<00:03:47.500> that<00:03:47.590> kind<00:03:47.770> of<00:03:47.800> thing

vehicle's pack and that kind of thing

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.040 
vehicle's pack and that kind of thing
but<00:03:48.390> that's<00:03:49.390> something<00:03:49.540> I<00:03:49.750> think<00:03:49.810> is<00:03:49.930> a<00:03:50.020> little

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
but that's something I think is a little

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:51.480 
but that's something I think is a little
bit<00:03:50.320> interesting<00:03:50.740> about<00:03:50.950> the<00:03:51.100> way<00:03:51.250> we're

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:51.490 
bit interesting about the way we're

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:52.950

a bad idea maybe we should think of that

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
think one of the things that we've been

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.250 
think one of the things that we've been
looking<00:04:42.460> at<00:04:42.580> is<00:04:42.790> so<00:04:43.510> we<00:04:43.630> did<00:04:43.810> an<00:04:43.960> experiment

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
looking at is so we did an experiment

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.409 
looking at is so we did an experiment
last<00:04:44.650> year<00:04:44.830> with<00:04:44.980> Nintendo<00:04:45.520> but<00:04:46.180> we<00:04:46.300> actually

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:46.419 
last year with Nintendo but we actually

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:48.480 
last year with Nintendo but we actually
made<00:04:46.870> one<00:04:47.140> point<00:04:47.410> 0<00:04:47.530> available<00:04:48.190> to<00:04:48.310> download

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
made one point 0 available to download

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.060 
made one point 0 available to download
for<00:04:49.000> free<00:04:49.380> and<00:04:50.380> since<00:04:50.620> the<00:04:50.770> figures

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
for free and since the figures

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.970 
for free and since the figures
themselves<00:04:51.280> you<00:04:52.150> know<00:04:52.270> or<00:04:53.140> what<00:04:53.410> instantiates

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:53.980 
themselves you know or what instantiates

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.760 
themselves you know or what instantiates
the<00:04:54.100> content<00:04:54.640> you<00:04:55.600> know<00:04:56.020> perhaps<00:04:56.200> it<00:04:56.620> would

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
the content you know perhaps it would

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.950 
the content you know perhaps it would
make<00:04:56.980> sense<00:04:57.010> to<00:04:57.730> actually<00:04:58.270> put<00:04:58.660> out<00:04:58.780> that

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
make sense to actually put out that

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.020 
make sense to actually put out that
software<00:04:59.380> there<00:04:59.710> for<00:05:00.520> people<00:05:00.669> to<00:05:00.850> download

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990 
stuff that we're thinking about but we

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.100
