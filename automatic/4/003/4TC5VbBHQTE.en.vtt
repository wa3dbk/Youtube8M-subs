to see if the cheese is there I can

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.920 
to see if the cheese is there I can
taste<00:02:23.629> the<00:02:23.810> cheese<00:02:24.049> a<00:02:25.389> little<00:02:26.389> note<00:02:26.689> on<00:02:26.719> the

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
taste the cheese a little note on the

taste the cheese a little note on the
cheese<00:02:27.230> I<00:02:27.500> believe<00:02:27.829> that<00:02:28.099> this<00:02:28.250> is<00:02:28.430> Coon

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
cheese I believe that this is Coon

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.199 
cheese I believe that this is Coon
cheese<00:02:29.889> not<00:02:30.889> sure<00:02:31.040> if<00:02:31.159> it's<00:02:31.310> tasty<00:02:31.579> or<00:02:31.969> just

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
cheese not sure if it's tasty or just

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.720 
cheese not sure if it's tasty or just
normal<00:02:32.569> cheese<00:02:32.750> but<00:02:33.560> in<00:02:33.829> Australia<00:02:33.980> Coon<00:02:34.519> is

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
normal cheese but in Australia Coon is

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.539 
normal cheese but in Australia Coon is
seen<00:02:34.969> as<00:02:35.180> a<00:02:35.599> higher<00:02:36.290> grade<00:02:36.620> of<00:02:36.769> cheese<00:02:37.040> so<00:02:37.459> it's

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
seen as a higher grade of cheese so it's

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.160 
seen as a higher grade of cheese so it's
not<00:02:37.700> like<00:02:37.849> in<00:02:37.969> America<00:02:38.450> where<00:02:38.629> you<00:02:38.659> get<00:02:39.019> the

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
not like in America where you get the

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.750 
not like in America where you get the
American<00:02:40.010> cheese<00:02:40.280> this<00:02:42.250> is<00:02:43.250> a<00:02:43.310> slightly

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
American cheese this is a slightly

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.420 
American cheese this is a slightly

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
better option for McDonald's to have put

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.909
