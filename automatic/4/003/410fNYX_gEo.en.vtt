 this time we will show you how 

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:14.460
 arm the structure of the nfc and its 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.310
 pipes the support structure for 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.529
 nfc in mind with the following material 

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:22.770
 weighs 1 parallel bar of the support 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:26.220
 pvc tube stepped support rod 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:29.850

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.250
 one 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.309
 you must assemble piece 1 with the 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.199
 piece 2 fixing it with screws step 2 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.600
 once in addition to the two pieces 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:41.600
 previous you will put a horizontal tie 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.930
 step 3 on the bottom and on another 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.270
 tight on top of the 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.980
 structure in each site are the 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.829
 perforations so you can assemble 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.989
 easily your structure should be 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.930
 as presented below 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:02.269
 step 4 now assemble the suspenders 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.729
 intersected on track 2 first 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:06.140
 place one and then the other trying 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:10.280
 that the screw holes 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:12.259
 match step 5 finally squeeze as 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.940
 all the screws that you put and your 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:15.480
 structure will be as shown 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.460
 continuation 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:19.860
 to arm the nfc system pipe 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.620
 we will need four tubes of 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.770
 Trapezoidal babies contact 9 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:28.440
 co2 for hose of 16 8 orizales with 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.150
 hose for hoses of 16 madrid with 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.300
 cut circles of 5 eighths of an inch 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.700
 a drill 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.830
 step 1 first we will make the hole 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.500
 for the irrigation line at each stage of the 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.270
 pvc tube with the help of cut circles 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.150
 and the drill as centered as possible 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.400
 Step 2 Connect the piece to the lid 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.260
 of the duct the piece consists of a 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.750
 initial with rubber attached a piece of 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.590
 5 centimeters of tube p that is also 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.590
 connected an elbow 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.670
 Place the rubber inside the hole of the 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.150
 cover and then insert the piece of a 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.150
 Pressure 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:12.970
 Step 3 then put the covers on each 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.920
 end of the pvc duct you can place 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.569
 silicone in all joints so that 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.200
 the doctor is there do not have exits of 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:21.970
 water in your energy system we hope 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.900
 This video will be helpful to 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.290
 next
