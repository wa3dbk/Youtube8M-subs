00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.870
 to open what is this package we are going to 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.280

 they were going to send some 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.460
 some a sleeve some covers I know but 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:05.260
 it seems that the package too big 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.030
 I think it has more than one let's see 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.360

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.200
 raffle there are gifts for you since 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.560
 that is one of the conditions that 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:20.140
 companies put and many can say 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.450
 what gifts to catch popularity or 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:26.550

 to grab views and this 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.630
 in itself it's more than the companies I 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.070
 they force me the companies see the 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.560
 videos when they send products 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.420

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.030
