which<00:01:53.790> is<00:01:53.820> pretty<00:01:54.090> cool<00:01:54.360> but<00:01:54.479> you<00:01:54.600> have<00:01:54.750> to

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
which is pretty cool but you have to

the<00:02:11.349> way<00:02:12.390> so<00:02:13.390> we<00:02:13.629> have<00:02:13.780> the<00:02:13.930> unveiling<00:02:14.349> of<00:02:14.680> XFX

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
the way so we have the unveiling of XFX

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.199 
the way so we have the unveiling of XFX
6850<00:02:17.140> and<00:02:18.129> just<00:02:18.370> looking<00:02:18.730> at<00:02:18.849> it<00:02:18.970> there<00:02:19.090> we'll

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
6850 and just looking at it there we'll

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:20.550 
6850 and just looking at it there we'll
the<00:02:19.269> first<00:02:19.450> thing<00:02:19.690> you<00:02:19.750> notice<00:02:20.019> is<00:02:20.080> it's<00:02:20.260> a<00:02:20.349> lot

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
the first thing you notice is it's a lot

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.640 
the first thing you notice is it's a lot
shorter<00:02:20.980> if<00:02:21.250> I<00:02:21.430> hold<00:02:22.090> that<00:02:22.299> there<00:02:22.599> and<00:02:23.409> pull

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
shorter if I hold that there and pull

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.930 
shorter if I hold that there and pull
out<00:02:23.799> our<00:02:23.970> 58<00:02:24.970> 7<00:02:25.420> you<00:02:25.540> can<00:02:25.690> see<00:02:26.080> that<00:02:26.379> the<00:02:26.980> 6850

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
out our 58 7 you can see that the 6850

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.240 
out our 58 7 you can see that the 6850
is<00:02:28.030> only<00:02:28.239> 9<00:02:28.629> inches<00:02:29.140> long<00:02:29.200> whereas<00:02:29.890> we<00:02:30.040> have

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
is only 9 inches long whereas we have

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.050 
is only 9 inches long whereas we have
the<00:02:30.459> rather<00:02:31.060> large<00:02:32.159> 5870<00:02:33.159> up<00:02:33.340> above<00:02:33.790> there<00:02:34.030> a

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
the rather large 5870 up above there a

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.030 
the rather large 5870 up above there a
lot<00:02:34.269> of<00:02:34.360> people<00:02:34.569> found<00:02:34.780> that<00:02:34.989> that<00:02:35.590> extra

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
lot of people found that that extra

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.430 
lot of people found that that extra
length<00:02:36.310> to<00:02:36.579> the<00:02:36.700> 5870<00:02:37.569> wouldn't<00:02:37.870> let<00:02:38.019> them<00:02:38.200> fit

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
length to the 5870 wouldn't let them fit

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.770 
length to the 5870 wouldn't let them fit
it<00:02:38.560> in<00:02:38.680> their<00:02:38.829> case<00:02:39.069> so<00:02:39.459> people<00:02:40.239> looking<00:02:40.629> at

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
it in their case so people looking at

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.420 
it in their case so people looking at
wondering<00:02:41.230> is<00:02:41.409> this<00:02:41.560> going<00:02:41.769> to<00:02:41.860> fit<00:02:42.040> you'll<00:02:42.310> be

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
wondering is this going to fit you'll be

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.849 
wondering is this going to fit you'll be
just<00:02:42.730> fine<00:02:42.849> no<00:02:43.239> worries<00:02:43.420> what<00:02:44.260> we<00:02:44.410> have<00:02:44.620> is<00:02:44.739> the

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:44.859 
just fine no worries what we have is the

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:46.680 
just fine no worries what we have is the
XFX<00:02:45.340> it's<00:02:45.579> they're<00:02:45.819> using<00:02:46.060> a<00:02:46.120> flower<00:02:46.420> design

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
XFX it's they're using a flower design

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.930 
XFX it's they're using a flower design
heatsink<00:02:47.440> here<00:02:47.709> with<00:02:47.890> a<00:02:47.920> fan<00:02:48.220> right<00:02:48.549> over<00:02:48.790> top

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
heatsink here with a fan right over top

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.330 
heatsink here with a fan right over top
at<00:02:49.120> the<00:02:49.180> GPU<00:02:49.660> you<00:02:49.840> can<00:02:50.049> see<00:02:50.859> it<00:02:50.980> hopefully

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
at the GPU you can see it hopefully

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.360 
at the GPU you can see it hopefully
right<00:02:51.790> underneath<00:02:52.319> and<00:02:53.319> the<00:02:53.620> fan<00:02:53.829> shroud<00:02:54.099> is<00:02:54.340> a

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
right underneath and the fan shroud is a

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:55.830 
right underneath and the fan shroud is a
little<00:02:54.790> actually<00:02:55.239> it's<00:02:55.329> a<00:02:55.359> lot<00:02:55.540> different

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
little actually it's a lot different

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.360 
little actually it's a lot different
normally<00:02:56.349> you<00:02:56.440> get<00:02:56.590> this<00:02:56.709> generic<00:02:57.220> looking

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
normally you get this generic looking

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.670 
normally you get this generic looking
fully<00:02:58.030> covered<00:02:58.420> fan<00:02:58.659> shroud<00:02:58.900> but<00:02:59.200> we<00:02:59.290> have<00:02:59.470> a

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
fully covered fan shroud but we have a

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.339 
fully covered fan shroud but we have a
little<00:03:00.190> bit<00:03:00.280> of<00:03:00.370> style<00:03:00.790> around<00:03:01.180> it<00:03:01.450> some<00:03:01.720> holes

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349 
little bit of style around it some holes

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:03.869 
little bit of style around it some holes
in<00:03:02.620> the<00:03:02.709> back<00:03:02.920> which<00:03:03.220> should<00:03:03.400> be<00:03:03.519> really<00:03:03.760> good

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:03.879 
in the back which should be really good

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:05.910 
in the back which should be really good
for<00:03:04.030> air<00:03:04.180> flow<00:03:04.359> actually<00:03:04.569> we<00:03:05.290> have<00:03:05.409> the<00:03:05.500> PCI

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
for air flow actually we have the PCI

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.940 
for air flow actually we have the PCI

has put their logo across the exhaust

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.920 
has put their logo across the exhaust
point<00:03:17.290> which<00:03:17.410> is<00:03:17.560> kind<00:03:17.739> of<00:03:17.799> cool<00:03:18.630> overall<00:03:19.630> that

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
point which is kind of cool overall that

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.949 
point which is kind of cool overall that
is<00:03:20.200> the<00:03:20.919> card<00:03:21.220> itself<00:03:21.549> XFX<00:03:22.120> has<00:03:22.329> really<00:03:22.780> done<00:03:22.900> a

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
is the card itself XFX has really done a

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.470 
is the card itself XFX has really done a
great<00:03:23.230> job<00:03:23.260> with<00:03:23.769> the<00:03:24.040> design<00:03:24.549> you<00:03:24.730> won't<00:03:25.060> see

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
great job with the design you won't see

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.229 
great job with the design you won't see
it<00:03:25.599> a<00:03:25.690> heck<00:03:25.840> of<00:03:25.959> a<00:03:26.049> lot<00:03:26.230> but<00:03:26.709> I<00:03:27.400> think<00:03:27.879> it<00:03:28.120> should

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
it a heck of a lot but I think it should

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.930 
it a heck of a lot but I think it should
be<00:03:28.299> very<00:03:28.480> good<00:03:28.599> for<00:03:28.900> airflow<00:03:29.230> and<00:03:29.669> that's<00:03:30.669> it

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
be very good for airflow and that's it

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.520 
be very good for airflow and that's it
the<00:03:31.060> 6850<00:03:31.810> make<00:03:31.930> sure<00:03:32.079> you<00:03:32.169> check<00:03:32.319> out<00:03:32.379> the
