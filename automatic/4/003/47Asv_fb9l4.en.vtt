say my car do you already have an idea
of<00:00:54.360> your<00:00:54.570> starting<00:00:54.899> setup<00:00:55.230> or<00:00:55.500> do<00:00:55.980> you<00:00:56.100> do<00:00:56.460> you

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
of your starting setup or do you do you

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.069 
of your starting setup or do you do you
just<00:00:56.699> have<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.850> base<00:00:57.329> set<00:00:57.510> up<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:57.750> seems<00:00:57.960> to

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
just have a base set up that seems to

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.610 
just have a base set up that seems to
work<00:00:58.109> best<00:00:58.469> at<00:00:58.649> most<00:00:58.859> tracks<00:00:59.190> yes<00:01:00.030> um<00:01:00.329> my<00:01:01.289> best

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
work best at most tracks yes um my best

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.830 
work best at most tracks yes um my best
setup<00:01:01.890> always<00:01:02.489> work<00:01:02.699> in<00:01:02.820> everywhere<00:01:03.149> but<00:01:03.539> here

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
setup always work in everywhere but here

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
setup always work in everywhere but here
is<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:03.930> a<00:01:04.080> little<00:01:04.260> cold<00:01:04.470> temperature

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
is that a little cold temperature

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.370 
is that a little cold temperature
compared<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.670> last<00:01:06.000> world<00:01:06.240> so<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.570> use<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:06.960> little

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
compared to last world so I use a little

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.399 
compared to last world so I use a little
softer<00:01:08.070> shop<00:01:08.250> coils<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:09.270> maybe<00:01:10.049> change<00:01:10.290> a

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
softer shop coils and maybe change a

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.770 
softer shop coils and maybe change a
little<00:01:10.530> different<00:01:10.979> light<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.850> I<00:01:12.090> tried<00:01:12.630> to

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
little different light and I tried to

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.440 
little different light and I tried to
start<00:01:12.990> that<00:01:13.409> setup<00:01:13.619> okay<00:01:14.430> what<00:01:15.180> sort<00:01:15.390> of

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
start that setup okay what sort of

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.179 
start that setup okay what sort of
things<00:01:15.630> do<00:01:15.780> you<00:01:15.840> look<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.080> change<00:01:16.680> first<00:01:16.979> on

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
things do you look to change first on

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.310 
things do you look to change first on
the<00:01:17.250> car<00:01:17.430> like<00:01:17.700> shock<00:01:18.270> Springs<00:01:18.570> or<00:01:18.810> tires<00:01:18.990> or

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
the car like shock Springs or tires or

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.760 
the car like shock Springs or tires or
what<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.680> think<00:01:20.549> I<00:01:20.700> need<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:20.970> are<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:22.170> think<00:01:22.530> tire

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
what I think I need to are I think tire

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.740 
what I think I need to are I think tire
is<00:01:22.920> like<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.159> most<00:01:23.310> important<00:01:23.820> I<00:01:24.000> think

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
is like the most important I think

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.410 
is like the most important I think
entire<00:01:24.990> different<00:01:25.950> tire<00:01:26.070> makes<00:01:26.400> also<00:01:27.090> changed

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
entire different tire makes also changed

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.450 
entire different tire makes also changed
I<00:01:27.630> think<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.409> big<00:01:28.560> difference<00:01:28.920> so<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.369> think

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
I think a big difference so I think

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.440 
I think a big difference so I think
setup<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:30.030> think<00:01:30.409> from<00:01:31.409> start<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.280> end<00:01:32.460> the

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
setup I think from start to the end the

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.690 
setup I think from start to the end the
end<00:01:33.570> race<00:01:33.810> I<00:01:33.990> think<00:01:34.200> not<00:01:35.070> much<00:01:35.280> difference

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
end race I think not much difference

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.840 
end race I think not much difference
only<00:01:36.000> few<00:01:36.600> show<00:01:37.290> chorus<00:01:37.650> or<00:01:37.860> deaf<00:01:38.280> oil<00:01:38.549> or

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
only few show chorus or deaf oil or

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:39.380 
only few show chorus or deaf oil or
light<00:01:39.030> height

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
light height

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.960 
light height
I<00:01:39.420> think<00:01:39.689> only<00:01:39.930> small<00:01:40.799> changes<00:01:40.829> for<00:01:41.400> car<00:01:41.579> but

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
I think only small changes for car but

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.270 
I think only small changes for car but
tire<00:01:42.210> I<00:01:42.600> am<00:01:43.350> not<00:01:43.500> sure<00:01:43.680> which<00:01:43.890> one's<00:01:44.100> better

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
tire I am not sure which one's better

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.520 
tire I am not sure which one's better
for<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.850> track<00:01:45.060> so<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.299> need<00:01:45.570> I<00:01:45.810> need<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.409> take

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
for the track so I need I need to take

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.510 
for the track so I need I need to take
time<00:01:46.710> for<00:01:46.829> testing<00:01:47.159> for<00:01:47.479> most<00:01:48.479> most<00:01:49.520> important

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
time for testing for most most important

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.570 
time for testing for most most important
thing<00:01:50.670> are<00:01:50.790> these<00:01:50.909> tires

same like same engines no modify stock

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.210 
same like same engines no modify stock
engines<00:02:36.030> in<00:02:36.300> a<00:02:36.330> stock<00:02:36.660> crash<00:02:36.900> and<00:02:37.290> no<00:02:37.950> special

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220
