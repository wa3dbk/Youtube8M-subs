there's<00:03:52.500> something<00:03:52.890> to<00:03:52.920> be<00:03:53.040> said<00:03:53.370> for<00:03:53.400> being

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
there's something to be said for being

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.100 
there's something to be said for being
in<00:03:53.909> a<00:03:53.970> place<00:03:54.209> like<00:03:54.450> this<00:03:54.629> without

mentioned this to Don and he comes up
with<00:04:06.629> an<00:04:06.870> idea<00:04:07.019> for<00:04:07.560> where<00:04:07.680> we'll<00:04:07.829> go<00:04:07.950> next<00:04:08.129> the

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
with an idea for where we'll go next the

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.319 
with an idea for where we'll go next the
only<00:04:09.930> issue<00:04:10.200> is<00:04:10.379> this<00:04:11.069> time<00:04:11.340> I<00:04:11.579> don't<00:04:12.269> know

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
sure what Don has planned but I hope

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:44.589 
sure what Don has planned but I hope
it's<00:04:42.930> worth<00:04:43.080> it

00:04:44.589 --> 00:04:44.599 
it's worth it

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:55.470 
it's worth it
hey<00:04:45.599> bear<00:04:45.840> hey<00:04:47.930> hey<00:04:48.930> bear

so<00:04:56.480> we<00:04:56.600> got<00:04:56.750> a<00:04:56.780> heavy<00:04:57.550> thimble<00:04:58.550> berry<00:04:58.730> thicket

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
so we got a heavy thimble berry thicket

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.690 
so we got a heavy thimble berry thicket
and<00:04:59.510> then<00:04:59.690> we<00:04:59.840> get<00:04:59.990> heavy<00:05:00.350> alder<00:05:00.770> cover<00:05:01.010> so<00:05:01.370> if

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:01.700 
and then we get heavy alder cover so if

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:05.480 
looks pretty foreboding and then when

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.360 
looks pretty foreboding and then when
you<00:05:05.600> step<00:05:05.870> inside<00:05:06.110> the<00:05:06.530> canopy<00:05:06.860> you<00:05:07.160> see<00:05:07.340> a

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
you step inside the canopy you see a

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
I took you here was because of this tree

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.850 
I took you here was because of this tree

that we see right in front of us it's
just<00:05:16.420> an<00:05:17.420> amazing<00:05:17.930> specimen<00:05:18.740> and<00:05:19.370> it's<00:05:19.550> so

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
just an amazing specimen and it's so

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:27.980 
just huge in ancient and everything

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:31.810 
just huge in ancient and everything
trees<00:05:29.110> well<00:05:30.110> they're<00:05:30.520> probably<00:05:31.520> pretty

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:31.820 
trees well they're probably pretty

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.850 
trees well they're probably pretty
ancient<00:05:32.090> old-growth<00:05:32.630> forests<00:05:33.200> I<00:05:33.440> would<00:05:33.620> say

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 
ancient old-growth forests I would say

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.040 
ancient old-growth forests I would say
you<00:05:34.790> know<00:05:34.880> several<00:05:35.150> hundred<00:05:35.300> to<00:05:35.750> maybe<00:05:35.960> a

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:48.410 
by just the structure of it in the size

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:52.960 
by just the structure of it in the size
and<00:05:50.350> you<00:05:51.350> know<00:05:51.380> it's<00:05:51.830> almost<00:05:52.160> leaves<00:05:52.820> you
