00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
I don't think so I think maybe or maybe

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.600 
I don't think so I think maybe or maybe
there's<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.079> chance<00:00:37.110> did<00:00:37.950> you<00:00:38.070> really<00:00:38.309> just<00:00:38.370> do

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
reason I think this could be good is

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.510 
reason I think this could be good is
