00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.250
 today the review of the quartet of 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.349
 dailus eyebrows I won my 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.809
 Ship refer I'm loving and doing 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.789
 reviews for you in four colors has 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.039
 an expensive brown tone brown tone 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.490
 dark the ceremony is a shadow 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.490
 illuminating 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.619
 with the bevelled brush let's get the 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:34.470
 to be neither put in our mother 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.579
 Here I take a lot but it's only for 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.290
 show you 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.930
 when you are going to use it day by day 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.850
 you do not need to use as much product 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.920
 There I take the clearest shadow that is a 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.800
 frog that combines more with all my 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.980
 hair and apply on top of that would be the 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:55.559
 People are going to make a mix of me there. 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:57.690
 I mix well and will stay there after I go 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.180
 taking more or being you will see if 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.640
 need more shade or if you want 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.800
 But this mill will be later. 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.390
 make the mix and we'll start 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.500
 apply on the eyebrows mine had 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.300
 made the skin 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.789
 that's when I do I always come with 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.880
 brush to remove the excess base and 

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:17.160
 then passing trade would be the 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.899
 Always trade for the downside 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:23.550
 makes a risk to the eyebrow and I go to the 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:27.210
 end with this risk 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:29.789
 I'll start thresher, and I'll go 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.709
 from the middle to the end and with the 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:33.869
 remaining leftover brush in step 

00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:34.679
 front of our eyebrows in the 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.209
 front 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:37.739
 I'll get more product later and I'll go 

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:40.429
 correct in those areas that need more 

00:01:37.739 --> 00:01:40.429
 connection 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.909
 in the front only use with filling that 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.909
 brush left over 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.750
 After that I'll make a 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.060
 take away the excess to become more natural 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.400
 I love it, I think it lasts a lot. 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.020
 super difference in makeup 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.580
 now I'll fix the other side 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.580
 for us it's the same 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.420
 sometimes we hope you have 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.850
 I like to tell you how to overcome this quartet. 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.670
 for whom I think only that he is at the 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:25.870
 shadow crumbles a little bit but pulling 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.070
 I really liked the result and lime 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.920
 supernatural you can use 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:33.170
 easily on a daily basis I think 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.820
 makes our lives much easier and that's 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.500
 I very much hope you enjoyed 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.500
 Kiss and see you next time. 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:54.900
 the helena with the laquÃª in a tank is 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:54.900
 I got in the box for the family purse.
