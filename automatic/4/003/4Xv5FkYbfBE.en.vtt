gets to the moon some might argue that

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.100 
gets to the moon some might argue that
it's<00:01:24.490> more<00:01:24.670> of<00:01:24.790> an<00:01:24.880> experience<00:01:25.600> and<00:01:25.780> less<00:01:25.930> of

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
it's more of an experience and less of
