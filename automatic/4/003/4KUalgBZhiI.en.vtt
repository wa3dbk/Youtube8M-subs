00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.400
 hello girls that as they are I hope 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:13.070
 that they are very well and good another 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:18.279
 Once I 'm in the kitchen I'm 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:18.279
 cooking again as you can see 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:24.200
 making white rice and I'm going to 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:27.829
 invite to cook with me a few minutes 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:30.890
 well since since then nothing comes back 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:35.210
 with you we will make a marinade 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:39.140
 pork with white rice and good this one already 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:43.179
 I have my meat here as you can see and 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.179
 Now I have cooked this 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:51.300
 I have it cooked and good as you can see 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:53.850
 There I have a chili that I have already 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.610
 to soak a little there is in the flesh and 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:03.120
 all that already washed and all girls and 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:06.860
 well now we return to the meat of 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.509
 here to a pan that hurts a little 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.780
 let's let it be achieved a little bit 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:15.509
 so that all her grace and this leaves her 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:19.490
 who in the pan and at the time of 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:22.649
 throw chili we have that saborcito 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:27.710
 we're going to make them brown and I have to 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:30.620
 me boiling rice 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:33.890
 and nothing chilli 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:38.210
 and I put them here on this plate and the 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.680
 we are going to liquefy with as I say to 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.409
 We are going to liquefy the chiles with 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.929
 onion 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:45.350
 let's go pepper and garlic that I already have 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:48.740
 weather 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:51.200
 and well we're going to liquefy it and if not 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.240
 we put little water but in die 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.220
 case we put the caldito that came out of 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.130
 the meat so that it has greater flavor is 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.350
 that our our marinade as they can 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.740
 see if our meat is already worshiping 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:06.140
 and it's getting more good fat already at the end 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.649
 and secondly that is a lot of fat since it has 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.780
 taken this one we are going to withdraw it because 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.670
 here is a lot a lot a lot of fat 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.060
 then I subtract them the only thing 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.830
 I want them to brown a little bit and because 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.459
 already my meat is already cooked is super 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.530
 blandita mire is very soft then 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:27.650
 What I want is that I do not do more 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.720
 pains and good now girls 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.160
 good girls like reyal iker our 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:37.100
 oil hour and decided to put some 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:39.150
 mushrooms there for what 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.490
 all right 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:46.590
 have more flavor and then more 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:49.810
 so I have enough like that for 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.370
 taste if you take and well that and mom 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.490
 put us here already almost when I'm going to 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.990
 put the chilito and to brown 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.850
 it's because we already know that the mushrooms 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.130
 a little bit of water is missing then 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.230
 that's why I put them to the end already 

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:05.400
 that my meat roasted golden brown as they can 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:08.849
 see is fine is symbolic 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.829
 and good now come back good girls 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:14.250
 here I already have moving my chili 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:17.490
 blender and we're also going to put it 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.740
 that is being cumin with milito 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:22.350
 with these little seeds like that and we're going to 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:24.000
 put a little bit not many what 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.760
 hold with your fingers because we give flavor 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.610
 very rich and also the laurel leaves 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.770
 I do not know if I know them in their lands 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.870
 true 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.280
 about two dates of laurel this gives 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.890
 very much flavor 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.850
 apart from what 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:42.069
 this is going to stay more more rich moms 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.950
 how do you see everything now if you are watching now 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:50.530
 said it has nothing of oil at all 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:55.510
 but and well, I already have my advocate 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:57.860
 here I am suitable and at the time of base 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.820
 art no 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.820
 in these ways 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.220
 we are going to empty well 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:12.900
 green that was a little thick 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:16.590
 this we are going to put the caldito 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:19.650
 we looked good from the meat that I here 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:23.050
 I already have it and I'm going to put it here to 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:26.960
 that gives a good flavor and good 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:29.840
 we're going to feel that they 're right 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:33.340
 thick we want it good to me 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:35.910
 husband and me if we like something exquisite 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.910
 Y 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:42.450
 and good girls, now, yes, here 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:46.000
 let's wait a little bit here to 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:48.220
 boil well and we tried to see if 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:53.020
 you need a little bit of salt or 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:55.600
 another pepper or it's already a matter of 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.460
 every person not me right now I'm going to 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.800
 try and see if you do not need to salt 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:02.290
 sorry and right now come back and good girls 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.360
 Well that's how we've already finished 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:07.210
 that area was very good and everything 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.770
 is very very very rich and good also in 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:12.310
 the rice 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:14.620
 I already was then this one because that's how it is 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.450
 as the girls try madly 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.420
 to do is not very easy to do it does not take 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:21.010
 nothing and then instead of mushrooms 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:23.790
 you can put potatoes of posts 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:27.060
 You can put zucchini 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:28.710
 so many vegetables that there are chayote and therefore 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.780
 Apart from being healthy and nutritious 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:33.180
 this one tips that I want to give you is of 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:35.070
 that when thing in pork or so 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.710
 They always leave the bones but not 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:40.140
 we like them but it gives them a very very 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.490
 very special to our dishes and well 

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.960
 nothing producing girls that have 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:46.100
