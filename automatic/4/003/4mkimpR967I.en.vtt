the<00:00:13.080> palace<00:00:13.349> of<00:00:13.440> darkness<00:00:13.889> but<00:00:14.309> before<00:00:15.000> we

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
the palace of darkness but before we

sure<00:01:16.170> of<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.380> bomb<00:01:16.560> not<00:01:17.070> quite<00:01:17.280> sure<00:01:17.750> but<00:01:18.750> um

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
sure of a bomb not quite sure but um

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.289 
sure of a bomb not quite sure but um
yeah<00:01:20.250> he's<00:01:20.400> really<00:01:20.610> angry<00:01:20.759> that<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.090> feel<00:01:21.270> a

rock in there but

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.520 
rock in there but
if<00:01:22.330> you<00:01:22.450> don't<00:01:22.630> throw<00:01:22.780> any<00:01:22.900> more<00:01:23.140> crap<00:01:23.350> in

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
if you don't throw any more crap in

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:24.480 
if you don't throw any more crap in
there<00:01:23.680> then<00:01:23.860> he<00:01:23.890> could<00:01:24.100> do<00:01:24.190> the<00:01:24.310> quake

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
there then he could do the quake

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.120 
there then he could do the quake
medallion<00:01:25.000> and<00:01:25.350> basically<00:01:26.350> um<00:01:26.620> if<00:01:26.830> you<00:01:27.010> don't

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
medallion and basically um if you don't

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.530 
medallion and basically um if you don't
know<00:01:27.280> what<00:01:27.370> the<00:01:27.460> quake<00:01:27.640> medallion<00:01:28.090> does<00:01:28.270> and

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
know what the quake medallion does and

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.080 
know what the quake medallion does and
you<00:01:28.720> tapes<00:01:28.960> everything<00:01:29.440> on<00:01:29.560> the<00:01:29.650> ground

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
you tapes everything on the ground

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.030 
you tapes everything on the ground
around<00:01:31.090> you<00:01:31.390> and<00:01:31.570> then<00:01:31.780> it<00:01:32.020> also<00:01:32.230> it<00:01:32.590> needs<00:01:32.620> to

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
I read it the first time I thought it

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.290 
I read it the first time I thought it
meant<00:03:09.600> that<00:03:09.720> my<00:03:09.930> pad<00:03:10.170> my<00:03:10.560> magic<00:03:10.950> was<00:03:11.100> on<00:03:11.430> it

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:12.300 
meant that my pad my magic was on it

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.820 
meant that my pad my magic was on it
only<00:03:12.480> half<00:03:12.690> as<00:03:12.900> effective<00:03:13.320> as<00:03:13.410> it<00:03:13.530> was<00:03:13.620> before

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
only half as effective as it was before

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.500 
only half as effective as it was before
so<00:03:14.040> I<00:03:14.310> got<00:03:14.459> really<00:03:14.670> pissed<00:03:14.850> off<00:03:15.060> and<00:03:15.330> I<00:03:15.360> went

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
so I got really pissed off and I went

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.380 
so I got really pissed off and I went
through<00:03:15.660> the<00:03:15.750> game<00:03:15.930> and<00:03:16.940> didn't<00:03:17.940> do<00:03:18.030> that<00:03:18.180> but

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
through the game and didn't do that but

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.930 
through the game and didn't do that but
then<00:03:18.540> I<00:03:18.630> realized<00:03:18.930> that<00:03:19.050> my<00:03:19.200> magic<00:03:19.940> got

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
then I realized that my magic got

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.000 
then I realized that my magic got
consumed<00:03:21.330> a<00:03:21.480> lot<00:03:21.810> more<00:03:22.020> quickly<00:03:22.260> if<00:03:22.650> I<00:03:22.739> didn't

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
consumed a lot more quickly if I didn't

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.640 
consumed a lot more quickly if I didn't
do<00:03:23.100> that<00:03:23.130> so<00:03:23.959> we're<00:03:24.959> gonna<00:03:25.020> go<00:03:25.140> ahead<00:03:25.260> and<00:03:25.380> just

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
do that so we're gonna go ahead and just

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.610 
do that so we're gonna go ahead and just
you<00:03:25.770> know<00:03:25.800> grab<00:03:26.130> one<00:03:26.340> more<00:03:26.459> thing<00:03:27.410> you<00:03:28.410> can<00:03:28.530> see

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
you know grab one more thing you can see

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.500 
you know grab one more thing you can see
the<00:03:28.680> giant<00:03:29.010> circle<00:03:29.310> of<00:03:29.400> rocks<00:03:29.610> if<00:03:29.940> you<00:03:30.180> recall

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
the giant circle of rocks if you recall

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.840 
the giant circle of rocks if you recall
in<00:03:30.780> the<00:03:30.959> light<00:03:31.140> world<00:03:31.320> there<00:03:31.950> was<00:03:32.190> a<00:03:32.400> tiny

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
in the light world there was a tiny

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.310 
in the light world there was a tiny
island<00:03:33.120> out<00:03:33.510> in<00:03:33.540> lake<00:03:33.840> hylia

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
island out in lake hylia

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.770 
island out in lake hylia
that<00:03:34.709> had<00:03:34.860> a<00:03:34.890> piece<00:03:35.430> of<00:03:35.580> heart<00:03:35.730> right<00:03:35.880> here<00:03:36.060> so

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
that had a piece of heart right here so

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.990 
that had a piece of heart right here so
obviously<00:03:36.959> just<00:03:37.950> go<00:03:38.130> ahead<00:03:38.220> and<00:03:38.520> then<00:03:38.700> go<00:03:38.820> back

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
obviously just go ahead and then go back

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.990 
obviously just go ahead and then go back
into<00:03:39.180> a<00:03:39.270> light<00:03:39.420> world<00:03:39.660> at<00:03:40.170> this<00:03:40.410> location<00:03:41.000> and

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
into a light world at this location and

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.900 
into a light world at this location and
you<00:03:42.150> should<00:03:42.330> appear<00:03:42.660> right<00:03:42.959> on<00:03:42.989> that<00:03:43.260> rock<00:03:43.470> and

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:48.550 

that's<00:03:47.910> freedom

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
that's freedom

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:54.550 
that's freedom
cactuses<00:03:49.560> in<00:03:49.709> the<00:03:49.799> way

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:02.480 

then<00:03:55.560> we<00:03:55.800> got<00:03:55.920> another<00:03:56.130> piece<00:03:56.340> of<00:03:56.520> heart<00:04:01.400> and<00:04:02.400> I

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:02.490 
then we got another piece of heart and I

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:03.740 
then we got another piece of heart and I
believe<00:04:02.730> this<00:04:02.820> all<00:04:03.030> the<00:04:03.150> pieces<00:04:03.360> the<00:04:03.540> heart

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
believe this all the pieces the heart

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.810

that we can actually access if you have

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.180 
that we can actually access if you have
a<00:04:06.110> wander<00:04:07.110> around<00:04:07.200> in<00:04:07.470> the<00:04:07.560> dark<00:04:07.800> roll<00:04:07.980> for<00:04:08.160> a
