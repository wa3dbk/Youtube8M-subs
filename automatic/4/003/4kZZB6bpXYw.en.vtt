00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:15.209
 the teens will be able to regain the look and feel 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:18.209
 our Windows XP computer a bit more to Windows Vista 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:21.300
 to the rich can 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.510
 if we are still with the so-called Lunau surface quasi 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:29.289
 drive then that is already quite boring because of the look and feel 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:32.740
 such militia even you since 2001 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.710
 and of course we have the opportunity with something called Schulz 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.000
 Elevator would still be the same from the principle to the end 

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:42.740
 just something different 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.740
 for the reason of my other like you ever had a transformation 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:46.589
 presented 

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:49.040
 so that's another option 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.120
 We start our roles 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.620
 Stamer browser 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.410
 and i am never the url line a http colon Opel / WW points 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.480
 Goods have 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.480
 Soft come there 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.480
 foreign countries forwarded anyway June 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.660
 our advice soft come there 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.040
 is the correct URL if you're still forwarded anyway 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.049
 the website is in Spanish but that should not be our intention 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:18.740
 to hold 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.760
 under spongy enough for such smart and the Godfather to find namely 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:25.490
 that Vista Live Schelb corner 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.490
 that's what we need »explains to me 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.560
 Franz Groll down in me wide 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.880
 There he is here 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.190
 Whistler Live Schellberg is currently the version 1 point 1 current 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.550
 and since my biological is the whole so just kept in gray 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.930
 we have a green table 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:48.860
 and there mine 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.730
 Pinky table 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.730
 we are all on the computer 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:56.860
 therefore 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.240
 to save 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.240
 I already have to hike 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.110
 I've just clicked on the PIN thieves% clicked to him 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.819
 or is it? 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.480
 So now I have the three parties, they come as an exe file 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.869
 after 

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:24.569
 because I'm just not just exchanging the standard parties 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.549
 as the example Klose shows is so common 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:31.069
 there are also a lot of other outsource part outsource so 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:34.410
 Exe files completely exchanged therefore must 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.410
 that kind of say transformation or 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:44.939
 im coming into a kind of installer as he is supposed to be at two versions i have 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:45.700
 now become the 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.620
 Krauel version I say install now and in the end see us too 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.630
 very briefly, then, of course, to see it in blue and pink too 

00:02:53.279 --> 00:02:56.639
 Of course, the installation is completely the same for all three 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:03.559
 as dollars are learning to exchange some of the original exchange files already 

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:04.549
 mentioned 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:08.069
 It makes perfect sense to cross a so-called restaurant 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:09.579
 the program 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:12.230
 the installer tries to do it automatically 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.120
 however, it must be ensured that the Windows will be the host 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.309
 running 

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:20.629
 if we do not have them running in another video already showed how 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:23.629
 we turn on and off in so-called Windows it enters the house 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:27.269
 if we do not work with them and that's a minor downside to Winnie 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:28.520
 if I have that before 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.190
 then the program will end, after that I will not pay any attention to that 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.529
 means the program does not try 

00:03:33.529 --> 00:03:36.949
 to use a rest opera and if it does not work then for 

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:38.489
 Example same on this computer 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.109
 then it will not say they want to quit but do the program 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:42.949
 simply further 

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:44.340
 we do not have any 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.579
 one is opulently set 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:49.700
 due to the exchange of Odin Albert Einstein but quite 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:53.709
 to recommend even if the installation we of course now 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:55.240
 tested here in advance 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.990
 in the end it will work again without any problems 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:00.870
 but there just every configuration on each computer somehow a bit 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:01.799
 is different 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:02.979
 should there 

00:04:02.979 --> 00:04:04.439
 take no risk 

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:05.299
 so 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:07.309
 if they do not know if luck is out of it 

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:11.389
 runs geese easily and order their own gusto they want theirs on 

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:13.209
 Start all programs 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:14.919
 equipment 

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:16.439
 System programs 

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:17.889
 and in the end 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:20.889
 System Restore 

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:24.370
 that's the program experience 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:25.919
 also listened more 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.150
 and at the end 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.150
 Restore system once you click on it 

00:04:31.059 --> 00:04:32.650
 then we have here 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.430
 a recovery spunk 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.050
 he place 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.400
 and at the end here quite normal 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.870
 click next 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.319
 how exactly this is done 

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:46.490
 that has already shown the other video 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:49.349
 that user is there in case of the case that with him the 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:51.160
 Industry the bus does not work 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.770
 and you absolutely need or want 1 4 percent 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.560
 so now we need here for this test, that is we do not give 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.240
 just never on the 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.279
 break up 

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:05.389
 the reason Firefox 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:08.940
 We do not need space now either click on Next we have to 

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:10.370
 to those 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.410
 Of course, agreeing to provisions just tick Next 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:18.439
 Should I install something to you if someone does not have the complete package 

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:19.249
 want 

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:22.249
 Of course you can now, for example 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:26.280
 tackle this topic if not replaced 

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:29.249
 or the skins became the software 

00:05:29.249 --> 00:05:32.249
 then the plus comes 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.729
 referred to the places 

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:39.889
 should set the ball, for example, manufacturer sets for one, I say now 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:44.550
 the calculator what is the second program Kayak which is here as 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:46.529
 exchanged 

00:05:46.529 --> 00:05:50.559
 At the end of the day other calculators are not groundbreaking 

00:05:50.559 --> 00:05:53.750
 of course different from our current calculator 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:57.180
 Sun water only a few graphic components I say now 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.740
 are changed as well as 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.069
 the Explorer 

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:04.069
 or how round this HH this help menu 

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:05.800
 Windows XP 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.800
 the Internet Explorer is also exchanged and so on and so forth 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:13.080
 Hermes conflict will also have exchanged MS Paint and so on and so forth 

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:17.840
 for that means if you do not want that then just the exe-file 

00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:20.839
 Mouse click and nothing is left 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:25.479
 exchanged if she gives her own system Rüttgers there 

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:29.520
 He notes Hartmann can activate them for the first option of course 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.020
 then they do not need 

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.349
 that the system is for her 

00:06:32.349 --> 00:06:34.090
 already a few minutes later 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:36.599
 again the same 

00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:39.719
 rightly so now and just to show what it looks like when it does 

00:06:39.719 --> 00:06:43.619
 not working we click as well as into german he is now trying on the 

00:06:43.619 --> 00:06:45.669
 to access the house 

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:48.189
 and I get an error message here that this is not 

00:06:48.189 --> 00:06:49.229
 had worked 

00:06:49.229 --> 00:06:50.949
 sunny to a removable 

00:06:50.949 --> 00:06:54.199
 but when I go to her call he is there makes the program quite normal 

00:06:54.199 --> 00:06:56.719
 continue 

00:06:56.719 --> 00:06:59.949
 Welsch more than the first shares like RTL that have already been another 

00:06:59.949 --> 00:07:01.509
 Video shown 

00:07:01.509 --> 00:07:04.529
 that was not necessary here 

00:07:04.529 --> 00:07:07.759
 Naumann otherwise grows directly to the corresponding parts 

00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:11.189
 install again pointed out that so not now the 

00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:12.580
 Possibility had 

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:17.050
 to cancel the whole installation because I noticed that UBS 

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:19.699
 Crippen does not leak i have GameStop and 

00:07:19.699 --> 00:07:22.699
 But I would like to have 

00:07:38.529 --> 00:07:41.249
 that was it with the installation of the power we have here 

00:07:41.249 --> 00:07:44.249
 on the exports 

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.419
 preferably 

00:07:48.419 --> 00:07:51.419
 Season in the calculator immediately new 

00:08:01.639 --> 00:08:05.330
 the Shutdowns Scream and the Butz colleagues became 

00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:06.400
 now he can too 

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.629
 should now be reinstalled 

00:08:08.629 --> 00:08:12.599
 Windows XP shows this just with a good saying now we're late 

00:08:12.599 --> 00:08:14.990
 we have again the classic Buz get 

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:17.569
 if we restart a second time then we have the same 

00:08:17.569 --> 00:08:18.029
 exchanged
