00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 in knots we are all together with a 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.920
 vegetation gÃ¼ines are we with a 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.120
 new career when with subscribers 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.800
 with the environment and a career awaits us 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.410
 15 laps that I think are not going to be 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:17.089
 many because I think it's not very long 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.089
 the track our show 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:24.240
 cojones as is well we have here a 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.890
 super mega hyper world ride that can 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.490
 be quite unanimous to be very many 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.780
 advantage has not come out and started very well 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.750
 naval ticket if we did not leave without any 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:35.670
 point here we turn left 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.110
 it's worth here, enter fast, you have to enter 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.239
 very fast because there like in three years 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.010
 fast and do not slow down some can us 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.020
 collide and we can mess it up like that 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.900
 thank good we have done well 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.030
 by the way I have left 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.670
 without contact since the race was 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.610
 default setting without contact 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.130
 so I trusted sir creator to see what 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.230
 so race 5 comes out so much because I'm 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.750
 entirely I think it's the first 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.040
 detect a lot very much time the 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.990
 first one that plays without any tact 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.380
 because I had not put in lately 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.790
 none without contact but in this as 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.190
 has come without contact and that very reliable 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.470
 from the creator and now that I think 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.870
 it can be fine even because I eat 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.800
 you have seen is not the guardrail there is a 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.080
 site that we have to hit 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.400
 then there as we are eight as 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.650
 some is stuck being a father 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.800
 we would be there eternal life so 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.250
 I think that we have done well to leave 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.320
 To be 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.300
 in fact some racing suits 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.590
 put them out of contact about all that's why 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.060
 but good that we always put 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.580
 standards and we do not crash our 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.229
 but good, so we're not going 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.930
 there 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:44.619
 ok we turn here in this little tunnel 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:46.690
 cited that we have here eye eye eye if I 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.729
 I'm going to explode and have more heat than 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:51.430
 now here I do not say that it would be very 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.909
 difficult to have more heat than now 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.640
 same 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.499
 let's go for the second try we're going 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.229
 the second round would be the first attempt 

00:01:57.499 --> 00:02:02.299
 the second round and the perfect 6th is 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.840
 a little bit like a little bit 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:08.269
 my mother, my mother, how do we control 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.599
 this table the objective we are going to put a 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:12.950
 objective and also today I am today I am 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:15.530
 with desire that you put for the 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.379
 comments on what position there are not 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.959
 what position do not you think you do 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:23.390
 that is, you think I'm going to make them 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.459
 what is left is to say that I believe that is is and 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.920
 two plus two more times for trying 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.930
 back I wanted you to believe that all three times 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.160
 I'll do it right the first time or 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.140
 believe that some of the roads as 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.989
 the comments in plan put what is going to 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.760
 do everything at the first or some you go 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.290
 to make a mistake if you think you are going to do 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.060
 first put it quite the first or not 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.730
 you're going to do the first one so we're going to 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.260
 see how many you accept and how many 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.140
 You mistake me I shit on everyone and I do not 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.970
 trust me very bad very badly 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.810
 I will try to do it all to the 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:57.340
 first that would really fly the truth 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:03:02.019
 because it would be a real lame pass 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:04.090
 ok it hit me we are this perfect 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:07.090
 my mother, my mother 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:10.480
 my mother there is nothing since I 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.920
 agacho that you have already wrong so 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.470
 next that we only have left 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.209
 two more attempts is going to be a technique 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.730
 They happen to say how this place 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.890
 next he has a lot of prison 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:24.159
 that is to say that to make it lower the first 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:27.640
 let's take here the curve 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:29.700
 perfect for madryn we are already doing 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.930
 a career of 10 seriously right now 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.299
 we have not committed any 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.549
 failure so perfect perfect not 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:37.720
 We knew there has never been good 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:41.080
 put it leave it in five laps 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:43.000
 record player 15 turns the common is 5 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.519
 back we will be here until tomorrow 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.269
 doing this race I want to do more 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:50.709
 races then I saw that he had very 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:55.620
 few kilometers and I say honestly 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.620
 when with this side is put 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:04.990
 eye eye eye because here we have a doubt 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:07.710
 I did not even try to catch it so 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:10.620
 that does not count as failure 

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:12.420
 my mother what you just got out of 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.140
 here 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.430
 why are you here 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.890
 counting stuff and he came at me like 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.350
 voucher voucher perfect perfect moment 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.910
 let's take perfect that does not count as I say 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.720
 since he has not even tried to do the 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:29.090
 jump so it does not count 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:32.820
 what was being said has already been 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:34.290
 forgotten not but seriously 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.750
 this kind of career I like a lot 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:38.810
 especially the root wat to these that you 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.150
 sends as well as 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.160
 that is, it automatically sends you 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.630
 which king the truth that quite soon 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.790
 the difficult thing is the controlled within the 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:49.010
 which drive but more or less the truth 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:51.590
 what are we giving? I'm liking this 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:53.330
 Career and eye is careful eye worth 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.770
 see if counting what I was 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.350
 saying that I just remembered more than 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.880
 nothing before was getting a little dizzy 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.590
 because I did not remember but now I've 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:03.110
 agreed much always just do what 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.820
 next if in a race he sets an example 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.130
 by default it's two laps 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:09.290
 so what else is it or do I see that 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:12.040
 You can ask to four but always 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:15.650
 say one more because if they put you two 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:17.540
 the same then Balearic coast becomes like this 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.490
 that counts as failure does not happen to the 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:22.400
 first if I want you to have put 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:23.720
 wants to shoot the rolled up that rolled 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.690
 of ally very badly because there could be 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:28.780
 done to the first perfectly not me 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:31.950
 I believe it 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.950
 what a fac 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.320
 how will it end first if I have pulled out 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:41.120
 very much advantage to all 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:42.680
 sometimes what does not have meaning 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.350
 meaning is that we just did another 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:47.300
 my mother's perfect time, lad 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:53.780
 seriously doing a 10-race - in 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:55.040
 this means that the note is fine for 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.780
 this race has been ahead of us but 

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.710
 it does not matter here the truth to see 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.180
 I want first and second because 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:01.310
 honestly I liked it very much 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:04.340
 how have i run this race the truth 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:05.750
 that has been pretty cool so nothing 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:07.700
 I hope you liked it if it has been 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:09.740
 well to say many, I was going to say 

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.880
 video the race has to be ready 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:14.090
 about to finish because I think that 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:17.750
 when we enter 4 I will start ordering efe 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:20.330
 I think they have entered a moment worth 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:23.659
 moment we are doing it all 

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:25.220
 as for the race to end well 

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:26.389
 What if you liked saying a lot 

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.340
 long before and video boats 

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:31.360
 you subscribed I'm not for any new 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:31.360
 you feel goodbye
