00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 fourth quarterly figures are now such 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.009
 a bit behind it 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.870
 I personally didn't have much of it 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.890
 expected but that had investors 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.330
 not himself either 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.349
 it was therefore mainly about the 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.019
 expectations that all those companies 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.790
 would pronounce for the coming year 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.440
 and i have to say when i get everything 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.520
 take each other then it all falls on me 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.170
 not with it 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.850
 man expected a little optimism because 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.080
 You also see that the economic couple what 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.939
 increases that you see the 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.010
 Purchasing managers are also the ones 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.769
 entrepreneurs have become somewhat positive 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.090
 but that optimism is certainly not yet in place 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.399
 to see their own expectations 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.500
 a very striking one 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.410
 found positive failures in this whole 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.370
 I think the company is also such a company 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.290
 has a lot last year 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.420
 disappointment show and for 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.969
 first you see optimism there and there you see 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.710
 so you do that buyers centimeters 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.739
 positive optimism also in the 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.210
 actual profit and om 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.309
 revenue development is reflected and 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.480
 You can hear that in the statements of the 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.370
 management 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.039
 that people a very striking positive 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.829
 exception and a striking negative 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.300
 exception to the money for I dsm 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.119
 There you see that they are of all 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.060
 sides to the wind have but name 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.340
 on the vitamin prices and yes 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.590
 some nice things in the nice growth 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.150
 story of dsm appear to be coming and whole 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.130
 Many investors will look very strong 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.659
 go look at it or not you 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.340
 deteriorating image 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.750
 or not the course is quite here 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.880
 strongly responded to 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.009
 dsm is one of the worst shares of 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.119
 this year so far as we like this site 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.619
 translate to total 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.390
 profit expectations then we see that the 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.040
 profit forecast it is clear to 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.540
 have been adjusted below 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.520
 investors and analysts are clear 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.170
 disappointed in all those expectations 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.299
 sees have inherited the business 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.829
 that the profit forecast also frowned upon 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.960
 has gone down and that is actually 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.960
 a continuation of a trend that we already have 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.670
 actually seeing two years as simple 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.040
 was translated into a sort of profit per 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.130
 Share Ajax that was two years ago 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.799
 35 at the start of the year was 32 and 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.469
 that is now just above 30 euros per 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.030
 ajax share has fallen and that is for sure 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.350
 not a good sign 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.299
 the rest of this year so clear what 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.890
 optimism because otherwise 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.170
 are the differences between the rising ones 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.670
 prices and falling profits too large and 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.670
 the one or the other side will correct
