so<00:02:02.640> from<00:02:03.000> now<00:02:03.149> on<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.479> eshop<00:02:03.899> is<00:02:04.140> going<00:02:04.350> to

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
so from now on the eshop is going to

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.449 
so from now on the eshop is going to
feature<00:02:04.649> US<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:06.469> Europe<00:02:07.469> because<00:02:08.190> it<00:02:08.340> is

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
feature US and Europe because it is

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.510 
feature US and Europe because it is
quite<00:02:08.849> different<00:02:09.149> every<00:02:09.509> week<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:10.520> that

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
quite different every week and that

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.589 
quite different every week and that
would<00:02:11.610> be<00:02:11.640> pretty<00:02:11.819> cool<00:02:11.940> because<00:02:12.239> it<00:02:12.360> means<00:02:12.480> i

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
would be pretty cool because it means i

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.540 
would be pretty cool because it means i
can<00:02:12.780> cover<00:02:12.989> all<00:02:13.110> the

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550
