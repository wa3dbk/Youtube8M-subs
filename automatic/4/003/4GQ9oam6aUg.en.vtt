players<00:02:09.080> of<00:02:09.259> each<00:02:09.379> team<00:02:11.769> so<00:02:12.769> what<00:02:12.920> we're

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
players of each team so what we're

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.070 
players of each team so what we're
jumping<00:02:13.280> in<00:02:13.340> this<00:02:13.459> game<00:02:13.670> here<00:02:14.060> I<00:02:14.720> guess<00:02:15.050> that

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
jumping in this game here I guess that

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.390 
jumping in this game here I guess that
you<00:02:15.410> know<00:02:15.470> I<00:02:15.530> think<00:02:15.709> it's<00:02:15.800> a<00:02:15.830> phenomenal<00:02:16.280> game

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
you know I think it's a phenomenal game

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.059 
you know I think it's a phenomenal game
will<00:02:16.580> be<00:02:16.670> a<00:02:16.700> lot<00:02:16.879> of<00:02:16.910> fun<00:02:17.500> trophy<00:02:18.500> support<00:02:18.920> I

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
will be a lot of fun trophy support I

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:20.530 
will be a lot of fun trophy support I
was<00:02:19.220> going<00:02:19.430> to<00:02:19.519> be<00:02:19.580> there<00:02:19.760> I<00:02:20.030> think<00:02:20.480> the

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540 
was going to be there I think the

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.850 
was going to be there I think the
chokers<00:02:20.870> will<00:02:20.959> be<00:02:21.050> a<00:02:21.080> lot<00:02:21.230> easier<00:02:21.260> to<00:02:21.590> obtain

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
chokers will be a lot easier to obtain

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.309 
chokers will be a lot easier to obtain
than<00:02:22.340> games<00:02:22.610> like<00:02:22.910> fifa<00:02:23.209> because<00:02:24.050> you<00:02:24.170> play

virtual tour world to remote the world

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.729 
virtual tour world to remote the world
to<00:02:44.120> remote<00:02:44.239> essentially<00:02:44.870> can<00:02:45.049> port<00:02:45.349> over

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
to remote essentially can port over

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:48.069 
to remote essentially can port over
you're<00:02:46.400> a<00:02:46.430> player<00:02:46.730> that<00:02:46.970> you<00:02:47.090> had<00:02:47.329> from

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:48.079 
you're a player that you had from

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:50.140 
you're a player that you had from
virtual<00:02:48.440> pro<00:02:48.650> so<00:02:48.890> in<00:02:49.130> your<00:02:49.250> fifa<00:02:49.610> games<00:02:49.819> yeah

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
virtual pro so in your fifa games yeah

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.850 
virtual pro so in your fifa games yeah
thought<00:02:50.269> it<00:02:50.360> was<00:02:50.450> actually<00:02:50.750> really<00:02:50.840> cool<00:02:51.140> you

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
thought it was actually really cool you

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.199 
thought it was actually really cool you
can<00:02:52.010> also<00:02:52.130> go<00:02:52.340> ahead<00:02:52.519> and<00:02:52.640> create<00:02:52.790> a<00:02:52.880> brand<00:02:53.090> new

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
can also go ahead and create a brand new

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.150 
can also go ahead and create a brand new
character<00:02:53.569> and<00:02:54.079> what<00:02:54.349> will<00:02:54.590> actually<00:02:54.680> do<00:02:55.040> is

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
character and what will actually do is

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.009

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
year don't see that wasn't trying to do

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:23.290 
year don't see that wasn't trying to do
some<00:04:21.920> of<00:04:22.010> the<00:04:22.070> moves<00:04:22.280> there's<00:04:22.910> the<00:04:23.090> lock

some of the moves there's the lock

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.390 
some of the moves there's the lock
symbol<00:04:23.600> that<00:04:23.870> comes<00:04:24.140> up<00:04:24.380> and<00:04:24.590> what<00:04:25.040> that<00:04:25.070> lock

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
symbol that comes up and what that lock

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.490 
symbol that comes up and what that lock
symbol<00:04:25.670> obviously<00:04:26.270> you're<00:04:26.870> not<00:04:26.990> able<00:04:27.170> to<00:04:27.350> pull

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
symbol obviously you're not able to pull

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.140 
symbol obviously you're not able to pull
up<00:04:27.590> and<00:04:27.770> moving<00:04:27.980> the<00:04:28.040> back<00:04:28.220> gives<00:04:28.610> it<00:04:28.910> allows

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
up and moving the back gives it allows

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.930 
up and moving the back gives it allows
for<00:04:29.570> things<00:04:30.290> like<00:04:30.470> having<00:04:31.040> me<00:04:31.160> you<00:04:31.190> know<00:04:31.520> to

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
for things like having me you know to

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:34.870 
for things like having me you know to
develop<00:04:32.600> your<00:04:32.690> player<00:04:32.930> and<00:04:33.260> whatnot<00:04:33.980> so<00:04:34.790> it

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
develop your player and whatnot so it

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.550 
develop your player and whatnot so it
does<00:04:35.060> add<00:04:35.300> obviously<00:04:35.780> a<00:04:35.810> little<00:04:36.140> bit<00:04:36.230> depth<00:04:36.440> of

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
does add obviously a little bit depth of

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.800 
does add obviously a little bit depth of
