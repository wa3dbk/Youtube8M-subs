00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:09.030
 so let's see how to change a 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.190
 fuse in an extraflame stove if for 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.500
 in case you see that the stove is dead 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:18.660
 then with the display with the display e 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:22.439
 without any signal first checked e 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.600
 if the plug is attached well, here and here 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.750
 in the socket try a 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:31.890
 change the socket 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.600
 this being the stove and continues not 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.750
 have a signal try to change 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.989
 fuse all extra flame stoves 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.149
 have a spare fuse now vi 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.190
 I show where and how to change it 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:48.570
 disconnect the fuse from the power supply 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:51.000
 reserve is there where there is the 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.460
 current stage this with a fighter 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.289
 nearby cut in this area made 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.590
 slightly leverage is a bit difficult 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:08.220
 so you need to be patient this is it 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:11.299
 here it usually opens then here it is 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.850
 that arrives voila 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:20.189
 then let's see a little here see 2 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:22.710
 fuses this is the fuse that goes to 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.530
 work and this is the backup fuse 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:31.009
 so you click happy if the 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.009
 fuse burned and exchanged it 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:51.649
 here is the credit and if the problem was 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.649
 that you solved it
