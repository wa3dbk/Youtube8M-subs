00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:15.889
 hi girls today as you see a guest 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:18.760

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:22.519
 I'll put the link to his channel in the nuts 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:25.220
 foundations and go take a look 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:26.570
 to her channel she now if you want to say it 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.240
 all of them have always been 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.849
 for me it is called lernher di kuyt 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.989
 but i'm sorry english but it means 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:40.270
 learn but just click 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:42.760
 learn it see in the video 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.280
 I invite you to go for a look not 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.140
 they are just own language lessons 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.150
 so why isn't she interested in 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.570
 parallel bikes that banks can 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:54.550
 be a little cute video because you 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.610
 I bring a little to my country then I do 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.650
 see some different cultures to me 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.020
 I find it so fascinating to know 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:06.479
 different things so i hope you 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:09.580
 Cavour likes them I'm sure of the usual 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.700
 bottleneck then she very nice for 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:16.270
 which is worth following even if only 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:20.470
 for this reason therefore in three separate girls 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.940
 this book I have to teach why 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.860
 you also see it from my channel 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:27.009
 this video we have to teach you years 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.110
 with our greeting but I wanted to greet 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:31.690
 I wanted to say goodbye in Arabic for years and 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:35.310
 I meant salam aleikum then which 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:41.170
 according to me it must respond to the max laura 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:45.490
 I mean but I'm learning limbo 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:47.319
 maybe that little, however, is therefore today 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.369
 since you came to see me here at 

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:50.229
 amsterdam 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.560
 I said what better opportunity for 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:55.300
 Doing an Arabic make-up is a suitable trick 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.459
 even girls with darker skin 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.860
 dark hair and eyes like me 

00:01:57.459 --> 00:02:01.149
 always ask for beautiful and therefore 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.270
 we thought about doing a tutorial 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:06.670
 precisely Arab style with this eyeliner 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.979
 a bit of them but you'll see there 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.170
 let's leave a tutorial and guys don't have to 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.270
 race to see why I'm not in 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.390
 27 years old and never succeeded 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:19.640
 my makeup apcom professor mimmo 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:22.280
 but now where I always load that 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.100
 they always had to go out again 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.230
 city â€‹â€‹that exact 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.200
 ok boy who leaves a kiss 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.610
 hi start as usual with a base 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.100
 for powder eye shadow 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.660
 this is a time you india wood ma 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.030
 however you will find the whole list of 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.390
 products that use the tutorial in the box 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.390
 information 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.620
 under the eyebrow I put a base 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:51.620
 neutral 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.020
 now I put this on the mobile eyelid 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.020
 beautiful golden color 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:23.620
 in the fold I put this color problems 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:32.019
 starts from the outside corner I bring it 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:34.590
 a little towards the eyelashes but then they follow 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:34.590
 the fold 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:44.129
 now I put this under my eyebrow 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.129
 flesh-colored 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.959
 now I'm going to put my rider 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:51.959
 in use 1 with felt-tip pen 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.680
 as we want to do a little trick 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.920
 Arabic style I'm going to draw with 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.690
 eyeliner also the inner corner though 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.700
 clearly if you want a little trick 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.700
 more natural you can skip this step 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:20.560
 and now I'm going to apply it to eyeliner 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.680
 also along the entire lash line 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.680
 lower 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:38.860
 and now I'm going to join the lower liner 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.860
 with the upper one in the outer corner 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.540
 now with a pen brush I go to 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.690
 take some more of that gold 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:57.770
 we used it before and spread it out 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:05:03.640
 up and spread it along a point eyeliner 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:03.640
 to give a golden touch to him too 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.780
 I always take that same brush 

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:15.500
 pen still purple and I put it 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:17.719
 just a little bit here on the outside corner 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.090
 now black pencil inside the eye 

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:21.680
 if you have small eyes you can 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.210
 skip this step because the pencil 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:26.020
 black inside the eye curtains 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.020
 shrink them 

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:46.789
 now we just have to bend our eyelashes 

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:50.679
 time that terrifies but then you give so much 

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:50.679
 to do it maybe not even folds 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.749
 Now 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:05:58.749
 black mascara 

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:04.429
 if you wish you could also use 

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:08.649
 false eyelashes but she has eyelashes 

00:06:04.429 --> 00:06:13.129
 very long and really doesn't need it 

00:06:08.649 --> 00:06:14.449
 ok now look up high we put it again 

00:06:13.129 --> 00:06:19.879
 a little know about the figures 

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:22.369
 lower as blush i use this 

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:25.089
 color that a pearly violet with some 

00:06:22.369 --> 00:06:25.089
 glitter 

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:44.779
 blush a little with the brush that 

00:06:40.559 --> 00:06:44.779
 I used to base it on the powder 

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:56.620
 now I lighten my lips a little bit with 

00:06:54.490 --> 00:07:00.520
 a simple concealer this in reality 

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:02.440
 however, an eye base is suitable 

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:04.390
 also as a lip base as bros 

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:07.200
 I use this mars blog that o 

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:07.200
 light pink 

00:07:14.689 --> 00:07:20.389
 ok girls the final trick and this me 

00:07:18.709 --> 00:07:22.729
 I also sit there so much but so much 

00:07:20.389 --> 00:07:28.389
 it was not my first book and this 

00:07:22.729 --> 00:07:28.389
 final makeup and just hi girls i have
