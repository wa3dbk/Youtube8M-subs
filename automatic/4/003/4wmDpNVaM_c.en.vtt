and<00:00:10.490> she<00:00:11.490> is<00:00:11.639> the<00:00:11.880> expert

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.410 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.409

are you going like yeah yeah over
overlapping<00:00:21.199> and<00:00:22.039> then<00:00:22.220> that<00:00:22.369> makes<00:00:22.640> it<00:00:22.880> look

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.060 
overlapping and then that makes it look

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:34.240 
overlapping and then that makes it look
very<00:00:23.300> strong<00:00:23.869> there<00:00:32.649> if<00:00:33.649> that<00:00:33.860> maybe<00:00:34.010> even

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
very strong there if that maybe even

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.049 
very strong there if that maybe even
smoother<00:00:34.550> and<00:00:36.159> it's<00:00:37.159> riding<00:00:37.550> the<00:00:37.850> pass

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 
smoother and it's riding the pass

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.310 
smoother and it's riding the pass
through<00:00:38.570> the<00:00:38.690> damage<00:00:40.659> is<00:00:41.659> no<00:00:41.960> pressure<00:00:42.170> to

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
through the damage is no pressure to

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.710 
through the damage is no pressure to
them<00:00:42.730> so<00:00:43.730> just<00:00:44.089> like<00:00:44.300> you're<00:00:44.449> camping
