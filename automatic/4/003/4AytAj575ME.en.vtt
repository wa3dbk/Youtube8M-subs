00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.640
 that for us, of course 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.960
 ready for the sixth year 

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.260
 to see children at a very early age 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.530
 time to see 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:19.720
 to gain an initial insight about 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.010
 talent talents are what they are 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.380
 games that are interesting and 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.689
 Of course, for the boys, the first 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.300
 that you have a selection situation 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:30.820
 where you are at the federal level of us 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.529
 be sighted and then accordingly 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.910
 to be selected now 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:35.620
 on the selection of the 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.300
 but team up here now 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.949
 federal level so that the federal coach 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.059
 it watching him and maybe 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:42.090
 a few tips on the way 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:44.920
 can give for the next years 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.530
 yes it is a long day for all of us 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.780
 the guys have three games here 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.850
 complete that means a total of twelve 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.290
 Games are about to make the day 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.570
 The guys are also in the whole day 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.129
 hall then have between the games 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.400
 your break will have been taken care of 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.780
 eat there and then in the evening then together 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.030
 in the hostel or here in 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.740
 bremerhaven now in a hostel where you 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.350
 Spend the evening together 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.210
 exchange a bit 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.580
 getting to know others in the conversation 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.590
 with your age mates for you 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.909
 very well 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.770
 to win this view over 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:23.620
 their borders bordered on for 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.090
 looking very important to us on talent 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.530
 that means now here we are looking 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.570
 Of course, what can they do 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.760
 player at the moment but also completely 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.280
 important for us to see what kind of a 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.990
 development can call the player so 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.370
 physical conditions that you 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.980
 bring along athletic prerequisites 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.870
 they have long term to look at what 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.010
 can become a talent and not 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.440
 just look at what can be 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:47.230
 player now that's for me and for 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.360
 the counter as mine with observer 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:51.550
 here very important and the first thing 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.300
 we can see where the journey with the 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.300
 go to players 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.620
 yes first of many thanks to the year 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.090
 rather that the project was extended 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.440
 especially now for three years 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.420
 Of course we have that 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.090
 planning security that is quite a whole 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.550
 important project because we are already very 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.500
 can see early where the talents are 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.510
 one helps the country coaches to look 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.400
 where are the talents bringing with them 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.170
 to work for the talents and I am 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.940
 very happy that this is now three years 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.710
 goes on and I have here as well 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:25.250
 Year always a lot of fun in the tournament 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:27.740
 I speak a lot with the 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.120
 in the run - up that they the 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.530
 give an overview what they do with the 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.970
 kids already how far are they in theirs 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.830
 training what can they do anyway 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.590
 This will make it much easier for us 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.760
 also to watch what are the talents here 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.620
 if we know a little better 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.090
 knowledge 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.670
 we look after primarily 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.590
 intensity and creativity play joke it 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.660
 That's why we're really after here 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.640
 young girls just look this 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.020
 the joy of the sport, the creative 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.590
 want to play the give everything 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.060
 fight 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.440
 Of course, they are physical 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.550
 conditions important technical 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.830
 requirement for the native 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.660
 conditions that is very clear though 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.800
 what we always notice immediately is 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.630
 of course player where you see 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.820
 people who wants the lives this 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.540
 sport understands the game that has 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.220
 enjoy it 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.220
 yes these are the most important things
