00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.670
 how to be part of this is a key 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.369
 usb is what do you have 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.310
 take this video 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.699
 first step would be your usb key 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:27.269
 of course in your computer 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:29.789
 mia and then we'll open the 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:33.320
 Disk Utility program where is 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:37.460
 does he find then you open feiner 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.460
 you go into apps 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:53.600
 you are looking for the file 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:57.230
 utility here with the the tools or 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:02.629
 the wrought and here should be found 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:05.530
 disk utility we will think we are good 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:10.970
 now you go to your usb key 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:13.820
 mine is here then that what 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:17.720
 what are you going to see here there are sos 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:20.119
 erased partition rÃ©a partition is 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.770
 what are we looking for click 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:26.149
 on it and that's it 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:32.210
 here you actually basically your key 

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:34.399
 usb here is the partition scheme then 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.820
 you can it's here that you can 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:40.910
 choose the partitions so you can 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:44.080
 choose between a partition what I have 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:50.979
 now up to 16 participations 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:53.119
 you can have a lot of hell in 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:56.000
 you can choose the size the 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.200
 also very simple partitions you see 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.270
 here size 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.689
 so we can there we will make it more 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:05.210
 tall than the other 7 100 megabytes you 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:07.400
 see that hilare has grown up so that's 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.769
 really a schematic of your usb key and 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.860
 sweet yes I 'm here took 7 points 7 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:17.540
 100 megabytes and 310 megawatts su 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:19.910
 ok a sua I want him the leader not by 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.400
 example for everything what is 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:27.709
 heavy files of which is to say 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:31.130
 big of the big video wat had some 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:36.220
 stuff that saves me a name files 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:43.070
 heavy and then the 3 100 megabytes kind 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:45.450
 lightweight logical files for 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:48.239
 important documents 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.739
 you can you can choose the name 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:54.300
 you will not make any difference 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:56.459
 then you can take it off 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.190
 as you can add with his 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:01.790
 buttons here because I'm going so you 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.930
 remove heavy files 1 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:08.430
 I can only but I want to add 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:10.080
 I position more whose names have 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:15.269
 changed also because I did it's 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:16.980
 and added and when you're on 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:20.459
 other costs pay attention that clears 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.769
 all of your usb key so if you have 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.290
 important things 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:28.739
 but this is already on your computer then 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:31.459
 does the partition and then of your computer 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:34.829
 ram and students on the usb key vote 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:41.810
 okay and then to finish you 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:41.810
 click here apply part 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:52.370
 and then you see here he's train 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:52.370
 make your partition of your usb key 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:59.900
 now that your score is 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:03.239
 over you can see on finder that 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.959
 do you have the impression of having two 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:07.319
 USB flash drives 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:10.260
 so you can add there that me the 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:11.250
 be careful before removing 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.670
 your usb key 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.049
 we want the two partitions before 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.030
 habit yes it's a year but here it takes 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:21.139
 all the cravings you dream of 3 removed 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:28.910
 the three you 'll have 16 you take off the 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:28.910
