00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.279
 commented that right now you know that dukes 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.250

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.230
 vice in a cookie shop where 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.210
 they rented lap station 1 and believe me the 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.610
 it happened very well I would like to know but 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.920
 good me through this beautiful gameplay 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.649
 a short gameplay I want to tell you a 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.950
 thing and that is Tony Hawk a few days ago 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.860
 behind 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:44.680
 affirmed the following that a 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:47.860
 new set of front skater and most 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.410
 cool is that this game would come out this 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.480
 year there were rumors that it would be seen that 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.670
 a new tonic was coming but there was no 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.380
 nothing confirmed but already with son with his 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.720
 in his twitter account he talked about 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:01.720
 video game and said it would come out this year and 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:04.390
 that is working on the obvious the great 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:07.090
 question is how many of you have 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.370
 played a video game is that I know that everything 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:12.390
 the world now plays like this was 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.280
 fifa approved fought for soccer not 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.740
 of soccer 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.590
 they suddenly play basketball like the 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.320
 American me that that egg in another tennis 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.140
 golf but when you have had the 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.470
 pleasure of trying out a videogame of 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.790
 skate me when I was boy had 14 15 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.770
 years 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.550
 I remember that once I went to powder 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:41.130
 blue to the pirate video games and I 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:43.560
 asked a hot dog vendor will 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.900
 recommended a game I do not know why I 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.030
 I bought the medal of honor 1 and I told myself 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.580
 good play you this beige and plan 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.120
 disrespect said poole is very good you 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.600
 I recommend 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.820
 but you skates play what if you 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.260
 I try classic el cid and I can play it 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.840
 and he proved it there's no no for him to 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.700
 see it and I loved not seeing just like 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:06.420
 the games that I want to see there was no 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.040
 thanks 1.2 350 and to your house the 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.130
 programs believe me I fell in love that 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:13.380
 game I fell in love or is it a game that 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.050
 that suddenly in the very little time 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.360
 people gave him little opportunity but little 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.940
 little to gain ground and I am surprised 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:24.030
 that once I wrote this 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.400
 intuit video game had a lot of people 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.940
 that you went into hostels that do not do the 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.280
 tonic when you use is that a lot of people 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.140
 that live twitch and many of them 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.760
 they are great also also black 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.830
 guys but a lot of people will have a 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.510
 nostalgia to see me fourth or young 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.370
 even part they bought the game 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:45.150
 to remember because they wanted to know if 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:47.300
 had the essence the essence the music or 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.050
 be everything and believe in this game has it 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:53.310
 Everything has everything everything but good 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.430
 Then he asks me what I would like to know 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.700
 how many of you 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.739
 hear something different that is not associated 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.410
 how much of you and the people who 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:05.180
 she is suddenly a fan of toni font that 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.340
 practice these games that 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.069
 like to see us in the next tony 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.200
 hawk is a skate game I would say that 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:13.400
 have everything this videogame has 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.620
 everything that is also gameplay that 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.569
 have all gameplay that has good 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.060
 soundtrack 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:22.489
 that is not boring that is rejugable 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.730
 rejugable that I finish it I see it for another 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:29.060
 time and that is the most important one that is 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:32.060
 a skate game please do not be another 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:35.659
 zoncera that you do not want to be a 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:38.150
 skate video game also asks 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:40.879
 for you what was your favorite tonic 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.349
 me to tonic prostate favorite 1 2 3 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:45.379
 I think he had speaking the grade here not 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:47.180
 I remember I do not know I do not remember how many 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:49.219
 but for me my favorite will be 1 and 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:53.450
 2 was with that is how I started the 

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:55.579
 truth as I started with those games 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.250
 but good to these gentlemen of the umh 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:04:00.799
 small a small test a small 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.079
 test and a small gameplay not to see 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:05.919
 is that what you think and I 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:08.719
 I would like to know how many of you 

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:11.260
 would enjoy or suddenly want a 

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:16.780
 gameplay of this new tony hawk no 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:19.000
 because it's not like it's as an example of 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.010
 final fantasy talking about rpg is very 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.990
 Little bit of people will see it 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.389
 few people will comment because the 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:29.410
 rpg's do not stick much like suddenly 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:36.039
 an adventure but a game of sport 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:38.500
 because sport is a video game is 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:40.090
 that to people on YouTube, I am the 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.039
 person who plays what they want to me 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.169
 it does not matter those who already know me 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:45.789
 I would like to know you because I easy 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:47.110
 if you tell me not the skate b2 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:49.539
 OK perfect 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.340
 I respect your opinion and all the roll and 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:53.740
 I would play the new Tony Hawk for me alone 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.630
 He was going to listen to us, so do not believe it, 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.729
 game that I tool alone 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:00.400
 right now for example I'm playing the 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:01.750
 final fantasy not the chrome 9 then by 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.150
