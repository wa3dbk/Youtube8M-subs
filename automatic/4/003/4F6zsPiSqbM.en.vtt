and on this side it says say said s nun

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.340 
and on this side it says say said s nun
is<00:01:58.140> which<00:01:58.500> is<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:58.920> latin<00:01:59.399> palindrome<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.659> it

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
is which is a latin palindrome and it

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.959 
is which is a latin palindrome and it
goes<00:02:01.530> forward<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:01.979> backwards<00:02:02.040> on<00:02:02.520> both<00:02:02.729> sides

goes forward and backwards on both sides

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.100 
goes forward and backwards on both sides
and<00:02:03.240> it<00:02:03.390> means<00:02:03.570> if<00:02:03.899> you<00:02:04.200> sit<00:02:04.530> do<00:02:05.070> not<00:02:05.250> go<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:06.110> it

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
and it means if you sit do not go and it

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.969 
and it means if you sit do not go and it
also<00:02:07.229> means<00:02:07.530> if<00:02:07.890> you<00:02:08.399> do<00:02:08.729> not<00:02:09.000> sit<00:02:09.450> go
