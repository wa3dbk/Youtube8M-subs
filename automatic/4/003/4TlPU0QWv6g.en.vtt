00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Opera 11.60's out
with loads of new stuff in it

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I'll tell you what it's about
in just a festive minute.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Site compatibility
got more robust and faster.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:30.000
In your Christmas sock is RagnarÃ¶k,
our HTML parser.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
HTML video
shines as bright as reindeer noses.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
It can be buffered and be seekable,
muted and preloaded.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
We all love our gradients!
So thank the Angel Gabriel!

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Not just boring linear ones,
but super-sexy radial.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
All cool kids love ECMAScript,
so shout out your hurrays!

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
We've got the mode that's oh-so-strict,
and sexy typed arrays.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
A present that is heaven-sent
is DOM Event Constructor.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Without it, synthetic events
are a total ... monkeyfighter.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Deck the halls with protocols!
Light the yuletide candles!

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
You can define the content types
that your web apps can handle.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.000
All platforms, even Win 2K
though that OS is shoddy.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:02:00.000
For Opera's wish for the new year
is the Web for everybooooooooody.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
[spoken:] Happy New Year
[misteltoe-tastic winsome smile]
