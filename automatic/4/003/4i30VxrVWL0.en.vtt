a couple of years ago when we found need

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.109 
a couple of years ago when we found need
in<00:00:14.870> the<00:00:14.960> market<00:00:15.350> for<00:00:15.680> a<00:00:16.400> coolant<00:00:16.939> with<00:00:17.089> a

in the market for a coolant with a
difference

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:22.570 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.330 

there<00:00:23.110> was<00:00:23.260> a<00:00:23.289> new<00:00:23.529> product<00:00:23.770> out<00:00:24.010> there<00:00:24.160> in<00:00:24.279> the

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:24.340 
there was a new product out there in the

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.450 
there was a new product out there in the
market<00:00:24.789> and<00:00:24.970> we<00:00:25.600> found<00:00:25.840> that<00:00:26.050> in<00:00:26.199> the<00:00:26.289> US<00:00:26.619> the

conventional corn in the cooling systems
what<00:00:37.809> we're<00:00:37.960> basically<00:00:38.260> doing<00:00:38.559> is<00:00:38.739> we're

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
what we're basically doing is we're

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.100 
what we're basically doing is we're
removing<00:00:39.190> the<00:00:39.850> water<00:00:40.090> component<00:00:40.960> from<00:00:41.050> the

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.110 
removing the water component from the

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.830 
removing the water component from the
formulation<00:00:41.800> so<00:00:42.460> Evans<00:00:43.120> you<00:00:43.300> are<00:00:43.420> so<00:00:43.570> been

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 
formulation so Evans you are so been

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.869 
formulation so Evans you are so been
able<00:00:43.989> to<00:00:44.110> formulate<00:00:45.010> a<00:00:45.070> synthetic<00:00:45.640> blend

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:45.879 
able to formulate a synthetic blend

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:47.520 
able to formulate a synthetic blend
which<00:00:46.239> does<00:00:46.540> not<00:00:46.809> need<00:00:46.960> to<00:00:47.080> be<00:00:47.199> mixed<00:00:47.350> with

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
which does not need to be mixed with

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.860 
which does not need to be mixed with
water<00:00:47.589> by<00:00:48.460> doing<00:00:48.790> so<00:00:49.030> with<00:00:49.300> eliminated

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
water by doing so with eliminated

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.170 
water by doing so with eliminated
corrosion<00:00:50.379> we<00:00:51.100> eliminate<00:00:51.550> any<00:00:51.760> chance<00:00:52.030> of

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
corrosion we eliminate any chance of

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.299 
corrosion we eliminate any chance of
overheating<00:00:52.750> we<00:00:53.110> eliminate<00:00:53.710> vapor<00:00:53.980> pressure

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 
overheating we eliminate vapor pressure

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:56.790 
overheating we eliminate vapor pressure
because<00:00:54.910> there's<00:00:55.090> no<00:00:55.260> evaporation<00:00:56.260> of<00:00:56.739> the

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
because there's no evaporation of the

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.160 
because there's no evaporation of the
water<00:00:57.100> and<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:58.510> pressure<00:00:58.809> build-up

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
water and and pressure build-up

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.250 
water and and pressure build-up
throughout<00:00:59.469> the<00:00:59.559> system

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
throughout the system

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.869 
throughout the system
Evans<00:01:02.260> waterless<00:01:02.649> engine<00:01:03.039> coolant<00:01:03.340> is<00:01:03.579> is

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:03.879 
Evans waterless engine coolant is is

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:05.010 
Evans waterless engine coolant is is
good<00:01:04.180> for<00:01:04.330> the<00:01:04.420> life<00:01:04.629> of<00:01:04.750> the<00:01:04.930> engine

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:05.020 
good for the life of the engine

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.950 
good for the life of the engine
basically<00:01:05.619> you<00:01:05.979> put<00:01:06.160> it<00:01:06.280> in<00:01:06.399> once<00:01:06.610> and<00:01:06.960> you

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
basically you put it in once and you

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.180 
basically you put it in once and you
forget<00:01:08.229> about<00:01:08.350> it<00:01:08.590> you<00:01:08.619> don't<00:01:08.830> need<00:01:09.009> to<00:01:09.070> have

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.190 
forget about it you don't need to have

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:10.980 
forget about it you don't need to have
to<00:01:09.340> ever<00:01:09.610> replace<00:01:10.030> it<00:01:10.240> it<00:01:10.539> doesn't<00:01:10.899> evaporate

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
to ever replace it it doesn't evaporate

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.270 
to ever replace it it doesn't evaporate
so<00:01:11.740> you're<00:01:11.860> not<00:01:11.950> going<00:01:12.100> to<00:01:12.160> need<00:01:12.430> any<00:01:12.580> top-up

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.760 

Evans<00:01:15.969> has<00:01:16.119> been<00:01:16.299> designed<00:01:16.749> in<00:01:16.990> a<00:01:17.049> way<00:01:17.200> that

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
Evans has been designed in a way that

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.580 
Evans has been designed in a way that
the<00:01:17.920> additives<00:01:18.369> stay<00:01:19.229> suspended<00:01:20.229> within<00:01:20.409> the

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
the additives stay suspended within the

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.059 
the additives stay suspended within the
solution<00:01:21.069> at<00:01:21.340> all<00:01:21.369> times<00:01:22.319> so<00:01:23.319> we<00:01:23.500> hear<00:01:23.740> many

00:01:24.059 --> 00:01:24.069 
solution at all times so we hear many

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:26.429 
solution at all times so we hear many
comments<00:01:24.670> especially<00:01:25.270> from<00:01:25.509> from<00:01:26.049> people<00:01:26.350> who

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:26.439 
comments especially from from people who

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:29.449 
comments especially from from people who
don't<00:01:26.619> drive<00:01:26.740> their<00:01:26.920> car<00:01:27.130> every<00:01:27.549> day<00:01:28.350> that

00:01:29.449 --> 00:01:29.459 
don't drive their car every day that

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:31.830 
don't drive their car every day that
when<00:01:30.459> they<00:01:30.579> do<00:01:30.640> go<00:01:30.939> to<00:01:30.969> drive<00:01:31.270> it<00:01:31.479> better<00:01:31.750> to

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
when they do go to drive it better to

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.230 
when they do go to drive it better to
replace<00:01:31.959> the<00:01:32.289> corn<00:01:32.530> and<00:01:32.799> that's<00:01:33.100> because<00:01:33.520> the

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
replace the corn and that's because the

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.969 
replace the corn and that's because the
additives<00:01:34.630> drop<00:01:34.869> out<00:01:35.079> they<00:01:35.500> settle<00:01:35.859> at<00:01:35.950> the

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
additives drop out they settle at the

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:37.709 
additives drop out they settle at the
bottom<00:01:36.069> bottom<00:01:36.729> of<00:01:36.819> the<00:01:36.880> cooling<00:01:37.179> system<00:01:37.209> they

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:37.719 
bottom bottom of the cooling system they

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:39.749 
bottom bottom of the cooling system they
crystallize<00:01:38.289> and<00:01:38.619> that<00:01:39.189> Colin<00:01:39.609> is

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
crystallize and that Colin is

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:49.219 
crystallize and that Colin is
effectively<00:01:40.649> useless

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.830 

so<00:01:49.890> what<00:01:50.040> we're<00:01:50.220> going<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.369> do<00:01:50.580> today<00:01:50.840> we're

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
so what we're going to do today we're

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.230 
so what we're going to do today we're
going<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.409> drain<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.310> coolant<00:01:53.549> out<00:01:53.939> of<00:01:54.119> this

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
going to drain the coolant out of this

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.109 
going to drain the coolant out of this
car<00:01:54.540> and<00:01:54.810> we're<00:01:55.710> going<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:55.979> put<00:01:56.220> our<00:01:56.400> evans

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
car and we're going to put our evans

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.499 
car and we're going to put our evans
product<00:01:57.570> into<00:01:57.899> it<00:01:58.049> in<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.860> first<00:01:58.890> process<00:01:59.610> we

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
product into it in the first process we

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.300 
product into it in the first process we
will<00:02:00.720> get<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.020> car<00:02:01.229> up<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.439> operating

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
will get the car up to operating

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.660 
will get the car up to operating
temperature<00:02:02.570> and<00:02:03.570> then<00:02:04.110> we<00:02:04.290> will<00:02:04.560> dump<00:02:05.460> the

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
temperature and then we will dump the

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.300 
temperature and then we will dump the
water<00:02:05.850> out<00:02:06.030> of<00:02:06.210> it<00:02:06.590> so<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.710> installation<00:02:07.979> of

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
water out of it so the installation of

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.430 
water out of it so the installation of
evans<00:02:08.729> waterless<00:02:09.149> engine<00:02:09.450> coolant<00:02:09.780> is<00:02:09.929> is<00:02:10.410> a

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
evans waterless engine coolant is is a

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.199

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
simple process but has to be done right

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.259 
simple process but has to be done right
to<00:02:12.600> ensure<00:02:12.720> you<00:02:13.110> get<00:02:13.230> the<00:02:13.350> maximum<00:02:13.650> benefit

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
to ensure you get the maximum benefit

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:17.540 
to ensure you get the maximum benefit
that<00:02:15.269> the<00:02:15.450> first<00:02:15.720> step<00:02:15.959> is<00:02:16.350> to<00:02:17.100> drain<00:02:17.370> the

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
that the first step is to drain the

existing coolant out of out of your
cooling<00:02:19.739> system

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.460 

the<00:02:33.770> biggest<00:02:33.980> factor<00:02:34.760> affecting<00:02:35.630> overheating

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
the biggest factor affecting overheating

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.010 
the biggest factor affecting overheating
is<00:02:36.680> insufficient<00:02:37.489> heat<00:02:37.640> transfer<00:02:38.150> as<00:02:38.959> a

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
is insufficient heat transfer as a

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.440 
is insufficient heat transfer as a
result<00:02:39.440> of<00:02:39.590> vapor<00:02:39.800> so<00:02:40.610> well<00:02:40.940> before<00:02:41.360> the

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
result of vapor so well before the

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.199 
result of vapor so well before the
boiling<00:02:41.720> point<00:02:41.930> of<00:02:42.020> water<00:02:43.000> conventional<00:02:44.000> corn

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
boiling point of water conventional corn

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.720 
boiling point of water conventional corn
is<00:02:44.330> already<00:02:44.510> starting<00:02:44.930> to<00:02:45.020> form<00:02:45.230> vapor<00:02:45.730> and

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
is already starting to form vapor and

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.360 
is already starting to form vapor and
what<00:02:47.120> you<00:02:47.239> find<00:02:47.480> is<00:02:47.690> that<00:02:47.720> that<00:02:47.900> vapor

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
what you find is that that vapor

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.830 
what you find is that that vapor
actually<00:02:49.370> reduces<00:02:50.000> the<00:02:50.030> thermal

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
actually reduces the thermal

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.130 
actually reduces the thermal
conductivity<00:02:51.050> of<00:02:51.410> the<00:02:51.800> water<00:02:52.010> by<00:02:52.750> 96<00:02:53.750> percent

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
conductivity of the water by 96 percent

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.530 
conductivity of the water by 96 percent
so<00:02:54.380> effectively<00:02:54.860> you<00:02:55.550> know<00:02:55.670> we<00:02:55.880> get<00:02:56.120> that<00:02:56.360> we

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
so effectively you know we get that we

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.449 
so effectively you know we get that we
get<00:02:56.720> comments<00:02:56.989> that<00:02:57.590> water<00:02:57.890> is<00:02:58.069> the<00:02:58.250> best

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
get comments that water is the best

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.449 
get comments that water is the best
thermal<00:02:59.390> conductor<00:02:59.989> and<00:03:00.200> it's<00:03:00.830> true<00:03:01.069> we<00:03:01.250> can't

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
thermal conductor and it's true we can't

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.490 
thermal conductor and it's true we can't
argue<00:03:01.610> with<00:03:01.790> that<00:03:01.910> but<00:03:02.750> only<00:03:02.989> in<00:03:03.230> its<00:03:03.349> liquid

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
argue with that but only in its liquid

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.059 
argue with that but only in its liquid
state<00:03:03.680> so<00:03:04.370> once<00:03:04.580> that<00:03:04.640> water<00:03:04.910> becomes<00:03:05.239> vapor

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
state so once that water becomes vapor

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:09.100 
state so once that water becomes vapor
the<00:03:07.069> the<00:03:07.370> thermal<00:03:08.000> conductivity<00:03:08.120> of<00:03:08.420> water<00:03:08.900> is

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
the the thermal conductivity of water is

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.430 
the the thermal conductivity of water is
no<00:03:09.260> longer<00:03:09.620> relevant<00:03:10.510> that<00:03:11.510> vapor<00:03:11.900> within<00:03:12.350> the

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
cooling system actually creates pockets

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.050 
cooling system actually creates pockets
throughout<00:03:15.950> the<00:03:16.160> cooling<00:03:16.489> jackets<00:03:16.910> and

separates the coolant from the metal

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.300 
separates the coolant from the metal
components<00:03:19.970> and<00:03:20.950> stopping<00:03:21.950> any<00:03:22.069> heat

you

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.310 

so<00:05:26.770> when<00:05:26.919> a<00:05:26.950> conventional<00:05:27.910> callin<00:05:28.270> begins<00:05:29.169> to
