00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
perfect way of doing that you can

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:55.360 
perfect way of doing that you can

00:01:17.169 --> 00:01:17.179 
insert button as well so you can insert

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:19.690 
insert button as well so you can insert
your<00:01:17.530> compressor<00:01:18.530> or<00:01:18.560> EQ<00:01:19.100> at<00:01:19.220> the<00:01:19.310> front<00:01:19.520> end

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
your compressor or EQ at the front end

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.460 
your compressor or EQ at the front end
before<00:01:19.850> the<00:01:20.060> converter<00:01:20.360> and<00:01:20.959> in<00:01:21.110> fact<00:01:21.289> when

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
before the converter and in fact when

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.710 
before the converter and in fact when
you<00:01:21.500> use<00:01:21.800> this<00:01:22.009> this<00:01:22.759> mode<00:01:23.030> it<00:01:23.270> splits<00:01:23.599> the

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
you use this this mode it splits the

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.080 
you use this this mode it splits the
unit<00:01:23.959> into<00:01:24.170> two<00:01:24.429> devices<00:01:25.429> so<00:01:25.819> it's<00:01:25.940> an<00:01:26.030> a

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
unit into two devices so it's an a

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.520 
unit into two devices so it's an a
channel<00:01:26.420> Mike<00:01:26.539> three<00:01:26.750> on<00:01:26.869> one<00:01:27.020> side<00:01:27.259> and<00:01:27.470> you

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
channel Mike three on one side and you

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
channel Mike three on one side and you
can<00:01:27.649> feed<00:01:27.890> something<00:01:28.130> entirely<00:01:28.399> different

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:28.550 
can feed something entirely different

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.219 
can feed something entirely different
into<00:01:28.970> the<00:01:29.000> converters<00:01:29.750> if<00:01:29.869> you<00:01:29.929> want<00:01:30.080> to<00:01:30.140> do

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
into the converters if you want to do

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.940 
into the converters if you want to do
that<00:01:31.330> the<00:01:32.330> converters<00:01:33.080> come<00:01:33.289> as<00:01:33.440> standard<00:01:33.530> so

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
that the converters come as standard so

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.469 
that the converters come as standard so
we've<00:01:34.099> got<00:01:34.220> analog<00:01:34.610> and<00:01:34.729> digital<00:01:34.789> outputs<00:01:35.390> of

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
we've got analog and digital outputs of

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.919 
we've got analog and digital outputs of
standard<00:01:37.300> those<00:01:38.300> of<00:01:38.450> you<00:01:38.630> that<00:01:38.720> might

00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:38.929 
standard those of you that might

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:40.210 
standard those of you that might
remember<00:01:39.140> the<00:01:39.319> double<00:01:39.530> of<00:01:39.590> weeks<00:01:39.740> we<00:01:40.130> no

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
remember the double of weeks we no

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.370 
remember the double of weeks we no
longer<00:01:40.250> have<00:01:40.610> a<00:01:40.640> fan<00:01:40.940> so<00:01:41.240> this<00:01:41.990> is<00:01:42.110> definitely

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
longer have a fan so this is definitely

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.889 
longer have a fan so this is definitely
improvement<00:01:43.009> oh<00:01:43.160> very<00:01:43.700> quiet<00:01:43.970> yeah<00:01:44.569> so<00:01:44.780> it's

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
improvement oh very quiet yeah so it's

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:47.320 
improvement oh very quiet yeah so it's
absolutely<00:01:45.289> Sun<00:01:45.819> multi-voltage<00:01:46.819> as<00:01:47.179> well

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
absolutely Sun multi-voltage as well

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.389 
absolutely Sun multi-voltage as well
work<00:01:47.690> everywhere<00:01:48.560> in<00:01:48.649> the<00:01:48.739> world<00:01:48.770> without<00:01:49.099> any

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.280 
switching or changing fuses
yeah<00:01:52.920> that's<00:01:53.310> really<00:01:53.490> in<00:01:53.760> summary<00:01:54.180> it's<00:01:54.330> the

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
yeah that's really in summary it's the

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.900 
yeah that's really in summary it's the
quality<00:01:55.470> of<00:01:55.620> the<00:01:55.710> conversion<00:01:56.160> when<00:01:56.280> you<00:01:56.490> use

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:56.910 
quality of the conversion when you use

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.970 
quality of the conversion when you use
the<00:01:57.090> new<00:01:57.330> burr-brown<00:01:58.140> converters<00:01:58.740> it<00:01:58.890> will

00:01:58.970 --> 00:01:58.980 
the new burr-brown converters it will

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.770 
the new burr-brown converters it will
compete<00:01:59.220> with<00:01:59.430> the<00:02:00.120> best<00:02:00.270> standalone

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
you can use a DAT with the 96 k so do

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.760 
you can use a DAT with the 96 k so do
you<00:02:35.130> have<00:02:35.250> to<00:02:35.790> a<00:02:35.820> do<00:02:36.180> outputs<00:02:36.720> then<00:02:36.960> and<00:02:37.230> then
