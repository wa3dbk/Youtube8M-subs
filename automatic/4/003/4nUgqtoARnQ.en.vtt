00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.440
 Welcome to this new gameplay of 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.030
 game lego batman 3 beyond Gotham and 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.740
 in this video, we are going to buy the 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.920
 three characters that we got 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:17.220
 unlock on the level in free mode 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.649
 chase in the sewers so 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.970
 now I'm going to buy these three 

00:00:19.649 --> 00:00:24.340
 characters 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.990
 Mario, guys, we entered the menu 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.779
 characters 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:32.000
 there is the first one that we are going to buy 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:34.940
 Well, this is what we have here. 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.750
 crack will cost us 10 thousand coins or 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:43.100
 pieces of lego let's get with him 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:44.900
 and we see what powers powers or what is 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.690
 what you can do 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:50.150
 we modeled a little and so I'm 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:53.110
 trying the buttons you can simply 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.110
 defend with your fists 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.500
 I do not know if it can be something more special 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.780
 but well you leave it to me in the 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.489
 comments if I forget or if I 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.650
 some power or mobility happens to me that 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:08.000
 have this character let's go for the 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.550
 next what is 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.550
 this same black blanket will cost us 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.550
 50 thousand coins or pieces of lego 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.080
 is modeling a little 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.090
 walk 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.280
 can shoot some 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.229
 the red bursts 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.979
 it also has a red ray as they can 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.979
 give it right now 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:39.430
 is perfect very well I like that more 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.110
 can not fly because of what I'm trying 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.870
 I'm trying several buttons to see 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.270
 if it can be something else this character 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.560
 but apparently not so we're going to 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.940
 model a little here for the 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:55.470
 video thumbnail and we change to the 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.470
 next character 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:03.680
 the next character is bein is going to us 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.930
 cost 100 thousand coins or pieces of 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.720
 Lego 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.720
 there we have it to bein 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:15.280
 prove it 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.280
 the prospects days 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.709
 what skills does this character have 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:25.470
 because you can simply defend yourself with 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.470
 the fists as we can see right now 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.930
 a combo of blows 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.909
 of the companion 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.950
 value something it can do this 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:40.549
 character is becoming a character 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.230
 great as you can see it right now like this 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:43.330
 that is pretty good I like a 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.030
 heap 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:50.590
 this music we have with force on the floor 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:52.850
 we cause a toxic crack 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.550
 so it 's great 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:59.160
 I love 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:01.050
 there we have 20 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.700
 for boys because these have been the three 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.739
 characters 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.080
 that we have unlocked at the level of 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.720
 chase in the sewers walks 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.880
 it can also be this slap 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.840
 that expels 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:18.660
 an energetic wave there we have it 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.430
 I like it good this is the character that 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.440
 I liked the three of us 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.510
 seen in this video you leave me in 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.879
 the comments which character has 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.440
 liked more and if I have forgotten some 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:30.150
 power mobility of the three characters 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.099
 that we have seen, they leave it to me in the 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.019
 comments so well I hope that you 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:36.060
 have liked this gameplay like and 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:39.269
 I have been favorites and subscribe if 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:43.790

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:43.790
 until the next with play
