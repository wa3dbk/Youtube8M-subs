as I can if they've got industrial

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.920 
as I can if they've got industrial
production<00:00:32.430> great<00:00:32.820> bonus<00:00:33.239> you<00:00:33.480> know<00:00:33.600> that's

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
production great bonus you know that's

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.750 
production great bonus you know that's
fine<00:00:34.200> but<00:00:34.680> I<00:00:34.739> really<00:00:34.800> like<00:00:35.130> is<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.280> idea<00:00:35.610> of

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
fine but I really like is the idea of

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.209 
fine but I really like is the idea of
movement<00:00:36.630> of<00:00:36.750> trade<00:00:37.020> goods<00:00:37.260> throughout<00:00:37.920> the

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
movement of trade goods throughout the

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.040 
movement of trade goods throughout the
world<00:00:38.430> because<00:00:38.820> that<00:00:39.210> has<00:00:39.300> been<00:00:39.420> incredibly

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
world because that has been incredibly

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.080 
world because that has been incredibly
influential<00:00:40.559> in<00:00:40.920> in<00:00:41.160> all<00:00:41.579> of<00:00:41.760> human<00:00:42.030> history

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
influential in in all of human history

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.810 
influential in in all of human history
and<00:00:42.600> so<00:00:43.320> when<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.739> first<00:00:44.100> set<00:00:44.460> of<00:00:44.579> screenshots

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
and so when the first set of screenshots

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.389 
and so when the first set of screenshots
for<00:00:45.300> EU<00:00:45.600> for<00:00:45.870> were<00:00:46.020> released<00:00:46.379> and<00:00:46.620> they<00:00:47.340> were

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
for EU for were released and they were

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.860 
for EU for were released and they were
showing<00:00:47.760> these<00:00:47.969> sort<00:00:48.180> of<00:00:48.210> trade<00:00:48.510> routes<00:00:48.719> of

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
showing these sort of trade routes of

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.330 
showing these sort of trade routes of
arrows<00:00:49.230> that<00:00:49.410> moved<00:00:49.620> from<00:00:49.770> one<00:00:49.980> place<00:00:50.309> to

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
arrows that moved from one place to

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.220 
arrows that moved from one place to
another<00:00:50.550> I<00:00:50.940> fell<00:00:51.660> in<00:00:51.780> love<00:00:51.809> with<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.110> game

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
another I fell in love with the game

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.170 
another I fell in love with the game
right<00:00:52.620> then<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.070> there<00:00:53.129> I<00:00:53.280> think<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.879> then

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
right then and there I think and then

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.970 
right then and there I think and then
actually<00:00:54.360> getting<00:00:54.690> hands-on<00:00:55.320> on<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.620> game<00:00:55.770> I

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
actually getting hands-on on the game I

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.010 
actually getting hands-on on the game I
really<00:00:56.699> like<00:00:56.850> how<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.059> trade<00:00:57.449> system<00:00:57.660> works

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
really like how the trade system works

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.830 
really like how the trade system works
out<00:00:58.199> in<00:00:58.500> in<00:00:58.859> practice<00:00:59.760> I<00:01:00.030> find<00:01:00.660> it's<00:01:00.809> very

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
out in in practice I find it's very

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.470 
out in in practice I find it's very
interesting<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.620> very<00:01:01.710> cool<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.480> certainly

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
interesting and very cool and certainly

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.630 
interesting and very cool and certainly
much<00:01:03.690> more<00:01:03.719> intuitive<00:01:04.260> I<00:01:04.650> think<00:01:04.920> again<00:01:05.489> it

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
much more intuitive I think again it

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.039 
much more intuitive I think again it
would<00:01:05.880> trade<00:01:06.060> system<00:01:06.240> you<00:01:06.450> can<00:01:06.570> actually<00:01:06.689> if

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
would trade system you can actually if

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.830 
would trade system you can actually if
you're<00:01:07.530> not<00:01:07.680> into<00:01:08.310> it<00:01:08.340> then<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.210> can<00:01:09.360> pretty

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
you're not into it then you can pretty

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.960 
you're not into it then you can pretty
much<00:01:09.930> not<00:01:10.530> pay<00:01:10.770> attention<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.490> if<00:01:11.610> you<00:01:11.640> want

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
much not pay attention to it if you want

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.340 
much not pay attention to it if you want
because<00:01:12.299> at<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.600> start<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:12.990> game<00:01:13.080> your

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
because at the start of the game your

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.990 
because at the start of the game your
merchants<00:01:13.860> are<00:01:13.950> automatically<00:01:14.490> assigned<00:01:14.640> to

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
merchants are automatically assigned to

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.969 
merchants are automatically assigned to
sort<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.240> very<00:01:15.600> logical<00:01:16.259> trade<00:01:16.530> notes<00:01:16.740> for

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
sort of very logical trade notes for

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.440 
sort of very logical trade notes for
your<00:01:17.100> nation<00:01:17.430> so<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:17.939> don't<00:01:18.090> have<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.270> worry

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
your nation so you don't have to worry

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.690 
your nation so you don't have to worry
about<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:18.810> from<00:01:18.960> day<00:01:19.110> one<00:01:19.350> but<00:01:19.799> then<00:01:20.040> as<00:01:20.250> you

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
about it from day one but then as you

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.859 
about it from day one but then as you
know<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:20.850> sort<00:01:21.119> of<00:01:21.210> get<00:01:21.360> more<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.720> more

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
know you sort of get more and more

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.330 
know you sort of get more and more
involved<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.380> find<00:01:22.619> out<00:01:22.770> there's<00:01:22.979> there's<00:01:23.280> a

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
involved you find out there's there's a

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.370 
involved you find out there's there's a
lot<00:01:23.610> of<00:01:23.640> ability<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.150> sort<00:01:24.450> of<00:01:24.509> fiddle<00:01:25.259> with

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
lot of ability to sort of fiddle with

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.890 
lot of ability to sort of fiddle with
things<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:25.920> make<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.369> lot<00:01:26.549> of<00:01:26.580> mine<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.750> I

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
things and and make a lot of mine and I

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.660 
things and and make a lot of mine and I
think<00:01:28.110> especially<00:01:28.350> in<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.799> multiplayer<00:01:29.130> game<00:01:29.340> I

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
think especially in a multiplayer game I

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.950 
think especially in a multiplayer game I
think<00:01:29.880> there's<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.060> lot<00:01:30.210> of<00:01:30.270> interesting

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
think there's a lot of interesting

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.020 
think there's a lot of interesting
potential<00:01:31.320> there<00:01:31.619> for<00:01:31.650> people<00:01:31.950> fighting<00:01:32.880> over

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
potential there for people fighting over

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.300 
potential there for people fighting over
these<00:01:33.329> trade<00:01:33.659> routes<00:01:33.930> not<00:01:34.439> militaristic<00:01:34.950> alee

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
these trade routes not militaristic alee

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.010 
these trade routes not militaristic alee
but<00:01:35.520> simply<00:01:35.850> by<00:01:35.970> manipulating<00:01:36.780> their

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
but simply by manipulating their

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.749 
but simply by manipulating their
merchants<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.560> moving<00:01:37.799> them<00:01:37.890> from<00:01:38.040> one<00:01:38.130> place

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
merchants and moving them from one place

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.700 
merchants and moving them from one place
to<00:01:38.790> another<00:01:38.970> so<00:01:39.540> how<00:01:40.020> does<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.350> system<00:01:40.500> work

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
to another so how does the system work

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.130 
to another so how does the system work
ok<00:01:41.130> so<00:01:41.579> centers<00:01:42.119> of<00:01:42.270> trade<00:01:42.509> are<00:01:42.689> gone

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
ok so centers of trade are gone

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.170 
ok so centers of trade are gone
completely<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:44.189> old<00:01:44.310> centers<00:01:44.700> of<00:01:44.820> trade<00:01:45.000> are

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
completely the old centers of trade are

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.230 
completely the old centers of trade are
gone<00:01:45.390> instead<00:01:46.079> now<00:01:46.729> provinces<00:01:47.729> are<00:01:47.759> grouped

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
gone instead now provinces are grouped

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.109 
gone instead now provinces are grouped
into<00:01:48.450> sort<00:01:49.049> of<00:01:49.110> trade<00:01:49.380> zones<00:01:49.649> right<00:01:49.920> so<00:01:50.790> every

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
into sort of trade zones right so every

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.240 
into sort of trade zones right so every
province<00:01:51.329> in<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:51.780> particular<00:01:52.259> area<00:01:52.470> will

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
province in a particular area will

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.090 
province in a particular area will
belong<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.579> a<00:01:53.790> trade<00:01:54.119> node<00:01:54.750> called<00:01:55.290> whatever

belong to a trade node called whatever

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.350 
belong to a trade node called whatever
and<00:01:56.280> generally<00:01:56.579> speaking<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.939> name<00:01:57.149> of<00:01:57.299> the

and generally speaking the name of the

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.139

node<00:01:57.570> is<00:01:57.780> very<00:01:58.680> similar<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.340> you<00:02:00.030> know

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
node is very similar to the you know

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.219 
node is very similar to the you know
what<00:02:00.329> you<00:02:00.420> might<00:02:00.540> think<00:02:00.600> of<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:00.869> center<00:02:01.140> of

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
what you might think of a center of

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.510 
what you might think of a center of
trade<00:02:01.380> for<00:02:01.590> example<00:02:01.950> in<00:02:02.040> the<00:02:02.130> Iberian

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
Peninsula there's quite a few provinces

actually flows or rather it can flow so

actually flows or rather it can flow so
there's<00:02:53.830> a<00:02:53.920> certain<00:02:54.070> amount<00:02:54.190> of<00:02:54.310> trade<00:02:54.580> that

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
can stay in the node and then it gets

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:57.870 
can stay in the node and then it gets

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
trade generally flows from the far east

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.680

through<00:03:11.230> to<00:03:11.560> Western<00:03:12.489> Europe<00:03:12.520> so<00:03:13.300> you're

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
through to Western Europe so you're

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.090 
through to Western Europe so you're
going<00:03:13.840> to<00:03:13.900> start<00:03:14.020> you<00:03:14.350> can<00:03:14.470> imagine<00:03:14.620> the<00:03:14.920> trade

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
going to start you can imagine the trade

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.530 
going to start you can imagine the trade
starting<00:03:15.489> as<00:03:15.580> far<00:03:15.760> as<00:03:15.850> Japan<00:03:16.239> and<00:03:16.450> then

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
starting as far as Japan and then

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:17.940 
starting as far as Japan and then
hitting<00:03:16.720> all<00:03:16.900> these<00:03:17.050> nodes<00:03:17.350> along<00:03:17.530> the<00:03:17.799> way

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
hitting all these nodes along the way

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.910 
hitting all these nodes along the way
and<00:03:18.250> then<00:03:18.640> finally<00:03:18.880> ending<00:03:19.330> up<00:03:19.799> sort<00:03:20.799> of

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
and then finally ending up sort of

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.820

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.590 
either in Northwest France or or England

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.210 
and then from the new world from the
Americas<00:03:25.989> it<00:03:26.140> sort<00:03:26.320> of<00:03:26.380> flows<00:03:26.590> east<00:03:26.920> into

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
Americas it sort of flows east into

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.610 
Americas it sort of flows east into
Europe<00:03:27.549> as<00:03:27.670> well<00:03:27.850> so<00:03:28.660> it<00:03:29.019> doesn't<00:03:29.380> mean<00:03:29.500> that

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
Europe as well so it doesn't mean that

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.590 
Europe as well so it doesn't mean that
that<00:03:29.680> final<00:03:30.250> node<00:03:30.400> is<00:03:30.580> the<00:03:30.700> most<00:03:30.880> valuable<00:03:31.330> in

is<00:03:34.269> trying<00:03:34.780> to<00:03:34.870> extract<00:03:35.350> as<00:03:35.590> much<00:03:35.620> trade<00:03:36.130> value

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
is trying to extract as much trade value

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.060 
is trying to extract as much trade value
as<00:03:36.580> they<00:03:36.700> can<00:03:36.910> for<00:03:37.269> themselves<00:03:37.750> so<00:03:37.959> what<00:03:38.950> you

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
as they can for themselves so what you

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:40.860 
as they can for themselves so what you
do<00:03:39.220> is<00:03:39.250> you<00:03:39.580> deploy<00:03:39.910> your<00:03:39.970> merchants<00:03:40.570> to<00:03:40.750> these

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
do is you deploy your merchants to these

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.270 
do is you deploy your merchants to these
different<00:03:41.230> trade<00:03:41.440> nodes<00:03:41.680> and<00:03:41.860> there's<00:03:42.010> two

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
different trade nodes and there's two

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.280 
different trade nodes and there's two
major<00:03:42.910> tasks<00:03:43.480> that<00:03:43.570> you<00:03:43.630> can<00:03:43.810> assign<00:03:44.019> them<00:03:44.200> to

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
major tasks that you can assign them to

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.370 
major tasks that you can assign them to
do<00:03:44.410> if<00:03:44.799> the<00:03:45.430> trade<00:03:45.850> node<00:03:46.120> is<00:03:46.329> in<00:03:46.750> an<00:03:46.840> area<00:03:47.049> where

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
do if the trade node is in an area where

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.470 
do if the trade node is in an area where
you<00:03:47.440> control<00:03:47.739> a<00:03:48.010> lot<00:03:48.250> of<00:03:48.370> land<00:03:48.610> well<00:03:49.209> what<00:03:49.390> you

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
you control a lot of land well what you

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:50.940 
you control a lot of land well what you
will<00:03:49.600> do<00:03:49.750> is<00:03:49.870> you<00:03:49.900> will<00:03:50.019> set<00:03:50.320> your<00:03:50.410> merchant<00:03:50.860> to

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
will do is you will set your merchant to

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:52.500 
will do is you will set your merchant to
build<00:03:51.130> an<00:03:51.250> office<00:03:51.400> there<00:03:51.730> and<00:03:51.970> to<00:03:52.120> basically

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
build an office there and to basically

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.830 
build an office there and to basically
try<00:03:52.780> to<00:03:52.900> keep<00:03:53.170> as<00:03:53.380> much<00:03:53.590> trade<00:03:54.040> in<00:03:54.640> this<00:03:55.420> region

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
try to keep as much trade in this region

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.410 
try to keep as much trade in this region
as<00:03:56.079> possible<00:03:56.500> and<00:03:56.620> therefore<00:03:57.090> suck<00:03:58.090> out<00:03:58.269> as

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
as possible and therefore suck out as

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.420 
as possible and therefore suck out as
much<00:03:58.600> gold<00:03:58.870> into<00:03:59.560> the<00:03:59.590> provinces<00:04:00.100> that<00:04:00.340> you

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
much gold into the provinces that you

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.670 
much gold into the provinces that you
hopefully<00:04:01.060> control<00:04:01.480> and<00:04:01.690> make<00:04:02.170> a<00:04:02.320> lot<00:04:02.560> of

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
hopefully control and make a lot of

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.370 
hopefully control and make a lot of
money<00:04:02.709> and<00:04:03.250> the<00:04:03.760> other<00:04:03.940> thing<00:04:04.239> you<00:04:04.269> can<00:04:04.360> do<00:04:04.600> is

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
money and the other thing you can do is

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.890 
money and the other thing you can do is
you<00:04:05.650> can<00:04:05.680> put<00:04:06.160> your<00:04:06.280> merchant<00:04:06.730> to<00:04:07.000> send<00:04:07.750> as

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
you can put your merchant to send as

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.390 
you can put your merchant to send as
much<00:04:08.019> trade<00:04:08.290> as<00:04:08.410> possible<00:04:08.829> forward<00:04:09.250> and

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
much trade as possible forward and

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.039 
much trade as possible forward and
certain<00:04:10.120> trade<00:04:10.390> nodes<00:04:10.630> have<00:04:10.840> multiple

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:11.049 
certain trade nodes have multiple

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:13.259 
certain trade nodes have multiple
outputs<00:04:11.860> some<00:04:12.130> don't<00:04:12.370> for<00:04:12.610> example<00:04:12.970> the<00:04:13.090> path

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
outputs some don't for example the path

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:16.080 
outputs some don't for example the path
around<00:04:13.769> Africa<00:04:14.769> for<00:04:14.890> example<00:04:14.950> tends<00:04:15.790> to<00:04:15.910> just

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
around Africa for example tends to just

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:17.789 
around Africa for example tends to just
have<00:04:16.209> one<00:04:16.239> output<00:04:16.660> so<00:04:17.019> then<00:04:17.169> it<00:04:17.290> becomes<00:04:17.620> a

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
have one output so then it becomes a

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:19.920 
have one output so then it becomes a
battle<00:04:18.160> between<00:04:18.419> if<00:04:19.419> you<00:04:19.540> have<00:04:19.690> a<00:04:19.720> lot<00:04:19.900> of

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
battle between if you have a lot of

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.420 
battle between if you have a lot of
colonies<00:04:20.380> there<00:04:20.560> if<00:04:20.769> you<00:04:20.890> formed<00:04:21.160> a<00:04:21.190> lot<00:04:21.310> of

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
colonies there if you formed a lot of

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.190 
colonies there if you formed a lot of
colonies<00:04:21.789> and<00:04:21.940> you've<00:04:22.330> established<00:04:22.780> them

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
colonies and you've established them

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.719 
colonies and you've established them
into<00:04:23.349> provinces<00:04:23.680> well<00:04:24.310> then<00:04:24.460> you<00:04:24.550> might<00:04:24.669> want

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729 
into provinces well then you might want

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:26.830 
into provinces well then you might want
to<00:04:24.940> keep<00:04:25.090> the<00:04:25.300> the<00:04:25.570> trade<00:04:26.140> where<00:04:26.560> it<00:04:26.650> is

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
to keep the the trade where it is

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:27.970 
to keep the the trade where it is
there<00:04:26.990> especially<00:04:27.230> if<00:04:27.470> you<00:04:27.560> have<00:04:27.590> kind<00:04:27.889> of

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:27.980 
there especially if you have kind of

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.860 
there especially if you have kind of
have<00:04:28.070> a<00:04:28.100> monopoly<00:04:28.400> over<00:04:28.669> the<00:04:28.970> land<00:04:29.180> well<00:04:29.720> you'd

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
have a monopoly over the land well you'd

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.390 
have a monopoly over the land well you'd
love<00:04:30.139> to<00:04:30.169> keep<00:04:30.410> a<00:04:30.590> hundred<00:04:30.980> percent<00:04:31.100> of<00:04:31.340> the

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
love to keep a hundred percent of the

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.340 
love to keep a hundred percent of the
trade<00:04:31.610> to<00:04:31.790> just<00:04:31.970> have<00:04:32.060> it<00:04:32.180> end<00:04:32.330> right<00:04:33.169> where

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
trade to just have it end right where

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:35.560 
trade to just have it end right where
you<00:04:33.440> have<00:04:33.590> all<00:04:33.830> your<00:04:34.010> stuff<00:04:34.180> but<00:04:35.180> meanwhile

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
you have all your stuff but meanwhile

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:37.330 
you have all your stuff but meanwhile
other<00:04:35.870> European<00:04:36.440> powers<00:04:36.470> might<00:04:37.040> send

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
other European powers might send

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.340 
other European powers might send
merchants<00:04:37.729> there<00:04:37.880> to<00:04:38.300> try<00:04:38.510> forward<00:04:39.080> as<00:04:39.199> much

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
merchants there to try forward as much

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.050 
merchants there to try forward as much
trade<00:04:39.620> as<00:04:39.740> possible<00:04:40.160> to<00:04:40.280> the<00:04:40.310> actual<00:04:40.760> you<00:04:41.030> know

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
trade as possible to the actual you know

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.300 
trade as possible to the actual you know
main<00:04:41.360> continental<00:04:41.960> Europe<00:04:42.260> so<00:04:42.979> that<00:04:43.160> they're

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
main continental Europe so that they're

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:44.620 
main continental Europe so that they're
going<00:04:43.460> to<00:04:43.550> be<00:04:43.610> able<00:04:43.699> to<00:04:43.880> suck<00:04:44.090> it<00:04:44.210> out<00:04:44.270> once<00:04:44.510> it

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
going to be able to suck it out once it

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:46.330 
going to be able to suck it out once it
gets<00:04:44.780> their<00:04:45.020> provinces<00:04:45.530> so<00:04:46.100> there's<00:04:46.280> that

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
gets their provinces so there's that

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.129 
gets their provinces so there's that
interesting<00:04:46.970> sort<00:04:47.180> of<00:04:47.270> back<00:04:47.479> and<00:04:47.660> forth<00:04:47.720> there

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:48.139 
interesting sort of back and forth there

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:50.800 
interesting sort of back and forth there
and<00:04:48.550> this<00:04:49.550> is<00:04:49.820> amplified<00:04:50.270> by<00:04:50.419> the<00:04:50.449> fact<00:04:50.690> that

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
and this is amplified by the fact that

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.500 
and this is amplified by the fact that
there<00:04:51.260> are<00:04:51.290> often<00:04:52.160> multiple<00:04:52.580> outputs<00:04:53.030> so

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.510 
there are often multiple outputs so

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:54.760 
there are often multiple outputs so
people<00:04:53.780> will<00:04:53.840> be<00:04:53.990> sort<00:04:54.380> of<00:04:54.410> doing<00:04:54.650> a

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
people will be sort of doing a

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.790 
people will be sort of doing a
tug-of-war<00:04:55.010> in<00:04:55.520> different<00:04:55.820> directions<00:04:55.880> and

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
tug-of-war in different directions and

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.110 
tug-of-war in different directions and
especially<00:04:57.800> when<00:04:58.100> you're<00:04:58.190> talking<00:04:58.340> about<00:04:58.639> the

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
especially when you're talking about the

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.930 
especially when you're talking about the
duality<00:04:59.780> of<00:04:59.810> whether<00:05:00.260> things<00:05:00.650> from<00:05:01.610> the<00:05:01.760> east

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
duality of whether things from the east

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.540 
duality of whether things from the east
make<00:05:02.510> go<00:05:03.110> through<00:05:03.350> a<00:05:03.380> land<00:05:03.650> route<00:05:03.860> for<00:05:04.130> example

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
make go through a land route for example

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.390 
make go through a land route for example
playing<00:05:05.330> as<00:05:05.450> muscovy<00:05:05.870> I<00:05:05.900> had<00:05:06.260> a<00:05:06.440> tiny<00:05:07.040> bit<00:05:07.310> of

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
playing as muscovy I had a tiny bit of

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.700 
playing as muscovy I had a tiny bit of
trade<00:05:07.700> flowing<00:05:08.000> through<00:05:08.300> land<00:05:08.510> routes<00:05:08.750> but

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
trade flowing through land routes but

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.129 
trade flowing through land routes but
some<00:05:09.950> are<00:05:10.070> going<00:05:10.310> overseas<00:05:10.639> and<00:05:11.150> some<00:05:11.960> of<00:05:12.050> them

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:12.139 
some are going overseas and some of them

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:12.850 
some are going overseas and some of them
are<00:05:12.200> going<00:05:12.350> to<00:05:12.410> cut<00:05:12.530> through<00:05:12.710> the

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
are going to cut through the

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.110 
are going to cut through the
Mediterranean<00:05:13.430> and<00:05:13.550> some<00:05:13.729> of<00:05:13.790> them<00:05:13.880> are<00:05:13.940> going

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 
Mediterranean and some of them are going

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.850 
Mediterranean and some of them are going
to<00:05:14.180> go<00:05:14.240> all<00:05:14.479> the<00:05:14.510> way<00:05:14.690> around<00:05:14.780> the<00:05:15.440> Cape<00:05:15.830> of

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
to go all the way around the Cape of

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.250 
to go all the way around the Cape of
Africa<00:05:16.669> so<00:05:17.210> there's<00:05:17.630> there's<00:05:17.840> room<00:05:18.229> for

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.260 
Africa so there's there's room for

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:19.779 
Africa so there's there's room for
really<00:05:18.650> manipulating<00:05:19.130> things<00:05:19.280> and<00:05:19.520> the<00:05:19.610> more

00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:19.789 
really manipulating things and the more

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:22.270 
really manipulating things and the more
merchants<00:05:20.300> you<00:05:20.419> have<00:05:20.630> the<00:05:21.320> more<00:05:21.560> trade<00:05:21.950> nodes

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 
merchants you have the more trade nodes

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.180 
merchants you have the more trade nodes
down<00:05:22.729> the<00:05:22.970> line<00:05:23.180> that<00:05:23.600> you<00:05:23.750> can<00:05:23.900> influence<00:05:24.350> and

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.190 
down the line that you can influence and

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.550 
down the line that you can influence and
also<00:05:25.490> there's<00:05:25.760> a<00:05:26.180> sort<00:05:26.660> of<00:05:26.720> a<00:05:26.840> trade<00:05:27.169> power

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560 
also there's a sort of a trade power

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.980 
also there's a sort of a trade power
statistic<00:05:28.370> the<00:05:28.850> more<00:05:29.120> that<00:05:29.300> you<00:05:29.360> accumulate

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
statistic the more that you accumulate

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:31.510 
statistic the more that you accumulate
of<00:05:30.080> that<00:05:30.229> more<00:05:30.590> effective<00:05:31.010> your<00:05:31.160> merchants

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
of that more effective your merchants

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:32.920 
of that more effective your merchants
will<00:05:31.639> be<00:05:31.760> it<00:05:31.880> sort<00:05:32.060> of<00:05:32.090> dominating<00:05:32.630> a<00:05:32.690> trade

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:32.930 
will be it sort of dominating a trade

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:34.450 
will be it sort of dominating a trade
route<00:05:33.050> and<00:05:33.320> getting<00:05:33.710> the<00:05:33.800> trade<00:05:34.039> to<00:05:34.160> go<00:05:34.280> in<00:05:34.400> the

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
route and getting the trade to go in the

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.430 
route and getting the trade to go in the
direction<00:05:34.580> that<00:05:34.880> you<00:05:35.060> want<00:05:35.090> I<00:05:35.479> love<00:05:36.260> the

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 
direction that you want I love the

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:37.719 
direction that you want I love the
gameplay<00:05:36.770> feature<00:05:36.979> I<00:05:37.130> would<00:05:37.310> think<00:05:37.430> it<00:05:37.550> works

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:37.729 
gameplay feature I would think it works

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:39.610 
gameplay feature I would think it works
really<00:05:37.820> well<00:05:38.030> it<00:05:38.450> ties<00:05:38.810> into<00:05:38.990> buildings<00:05:39.470> and

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:39.620 
really well it ties into buildings and

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:41.529 
really well it ties into buildings and
that<00:05:39.740> when<00:05:39.889> you<00:05:39.979> in<00:05:40.729> your<00:05:40.880> provinces<00:05:41.300> you<00:05:41.389> can

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:41.539 
that when you in your provinces you can

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:42.879 
that when you in your provinces you can
build<00:05:41.720> certain<00:05:41.960> trade<00:05:42.200> posts<00:05:42.560> and<00:05:42.650> docks

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:42.889 
build certain trade posts and docks

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:44.650 
build certain trade posts and docks
which<00:05:43.400> will<00:05:43.580> increase<00:05:43.789> your<00:05:43.910> local<00:05:44.419> trade

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:44.660 
which will increase your local trade

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:48.010 
which will increase your local trade
power<00:05:44.870> so<00:05:45.139> in<00:05:45.860> the<00:05:46.070> node<00:05:46.280> connected<00:05:46.789> to<00:05:47.300> that

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:48.020 
power so in the node connected to that

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:49.390 
power so in the node connected to that
province<00:05:48.560> you<00:05:48.800> will<00:05:48.889> get<00:05:49.010> more<00:05:49.070> and<00:05:49.340> more

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:49.400 
province you will get more and more

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.100 
province you will get more and more
trade<00:05:49.700> power<00:05:49.910> and<00:05:50.150> more<00:05:50.300> and<00:05:50.419> more<00:05:50.450> ability<00:05:50.990> to

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.110 
trade power and more and more ability to

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:53.320 
trade power and more and more ability to
influence<00:05:51.470> whether<00:05:52.310> the<00:05:52.520> trade<00:05:52.729> stays<00:05:53.000> or<00:05:53.210> not

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.330 
influence whether the trade stays or not

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:54.580 
influence whether the trade stays or not
and<00:05:53.479> probably<00:05:53.510> in<00:05:53.960> that<00:05:54.080> case<00:05:54.320> you're<00:05:54.470> going

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:54.590 
and probably in that case you're going

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:56.200 
and probably in that case you're going
to<00:05:54.650> want<00:05:54.740> to<00:05:54.800> trade<00:05:55.039> just<00:05:55.310> stay<00:05:55.700> in<00:05:55.940> the<00:05:56.060> area

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:56.210 
to want to trade just stay in the area

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:58.900 
to want to trade just stay in the area
as<00:05:56.539> much<00:05:56.720> as<00:05:56.870> possible<00:05:57.490> playing<00:05:58.490> a<00:05:58.610> certain

00:05:58.900 --> 00:05:58.910 
as much as possible playing a certain

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:00.460 
as much as possible playing a certain
nations<00:05:59.060> trade<00:05:59.599> will<00:05:59.810> be<00:05:59.930> your<00:06:00.139> number<00:06:00.440> one

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:00.470 
nations trade will be your number one

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:02.140 
nations trade will be your number one
source<00:06:00.740> of<00:06:00.889> income<00:06:01.010> playing<00:06:01.700> as<00:06:01.820> different

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:02.150 
source of income playing as different

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.180 
source of income playing as different
nations<00:06:02.450> trade<00:06:02.990> will<00:06:03.200> not<00:06:03.380> be<00:06:03.560> significant<00:06:04.099> in

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:04.190 
nations trade will not be significant in

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:05.500 
nations trade will not be significant in
any<00:06:04.340> way<00:06:04.490> it<00:06:04.610> really<00:06:04.820> depends<00:06:05.120> on<00:06:05.210> where<00:06:05.389> you

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:05.510 
any way it really depends on where you

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:06.520 
any way it really depends on where you
are<00:06:05.690> and<00:06:05.840> what<00:06:05.930> kind<00:06:06.139> of<00:06:06.169> a<00:06:06.229> game<00:06:06.349> you're

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:06.530 
are and what kind of a game you're

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:09.100 
are and what kind of a game you're
playing<00:06:06.770> and<00:06:07.270> it's<00:06:08.270> fun<00:06:08.479> enough<00:06:08.690> against<00:06:08.990> the

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:09.110 
playing and it's fun enough against the

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.140 
playing and it's fun enough against the
computer<00:06:09.260> but<00:06:09.680> I<00:06:09.860> really<00:06:10.639> think<00:06:10.669> that<00:06:10.910> in<00:06:11.090> a

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:11.150 
computer but I really think that in a

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.750 
computer but I really think that in a
multiplayer<00:06:11.419> game<00:06:11.690> you<00:06:12.229> could<00:06:12.440> be<00:06:12.560> cut<00:06:13.190> throat

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:13.760 
multiplayer game you could be cut throat

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:14.950 
multiplayer game you could be cut throat
when<00:06:13.970> it<00:06:14.090> comes<00:06:14.240> to<00:06:14.360> trade<00:06:14.599> and<00:06:14.840> I'm

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:14.960 
when it comes to trade and I'm

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.930 
when it comes to trade and I'm
fascinated<00:06:15.530> to<00:06:15.889> see<00:06:15.950> that<00:06:16.220> unfortunately<00:06:16.849> in

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:16.940 
fascinated to see that unfortunately in

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:18.159 
fascinated to see that unfortunately in
my<00:06:17.090> multiplayer<00:06:17.510> game<00:06:17.720> because<00:06:17.990> I<00:06:18.050> was

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:18.169 
my multiplayer game because I was

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:20.469 
my multiplayer game because I was
playing<00:06:18.349> as<00:06:18.440> muscovy<00:06:18.800> trade<00:06:19.460> was<00:06:19.760> not<00:06:19.789> a<00:06:20.150> very

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:20.479 
playing as muscovy trade was not a very

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:21.760 
playing as muscovy trade was not a very
important<00:06:20.930> thing<00:06:21.050> so<00:06:21.229> I<00:06:21.260> didn't<00:06:21.500> really<00:06:21.650> get

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:21.770 
important thing so I didn't really get

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:23.409 
important thing so I didn't really get
the<00:06:21.919> experience<00:06:22.099> of<00:06:22.340> that<00:06:22.490> part<00:06:22.789> of<00:06:22.880> it<00:06:22.940> but

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:23.419 
the experience of that part of it but

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:25.450 
the experience of that part of it but
I'm<00:06:23.539> sure<00:06:23.840> that<00:06:24.139> for<00:06:24.380> Casteel<00:06:24.800> who<00:06:25.010> was<00:06:25.130> making

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:25.460 
I'm sure that for Casteel who was making

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.270 
I'm sure that for Casteel who was making
a<00:06:25.639> mint<00:06:26.539> he<00:06:26.780> was<00:06:26.900> making<00:06:27.200> tons<00:06:27.500> of<00:06:27.710> money<00:06:27.770> based

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:28.280 
a mint he was making tons of money based

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.430 
a mint he was making tons of money based
on<00:06:28.580> based<00:06:29.090> on<00:06:29.300> trade<00:06:29.570> I'm<00:06:29.900> sure<00:06:30.169> that<00:06:30.320> was<00:06:30.380> a

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:30.440 
on based on trade I'm sure that was a

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:31.589 
on based on trade I'm sure that was a
pretty<00:06:30.650> big<00:06:30.860> deal<00:06:30.979> and<00:06:31.190> he<00:06:31.250> was<00:06:31.340> probably

00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:31.599 
pretty big deal and he was probably

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:33.460 
pretty big deal and he was probably
skirmishing<00:06:32.599> a<00:06:32.720> little<00:06:32.960> bit<00:06:33.050> behind<00:06:33.200> the

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:33.470 
skirmishing a little bit behind the
