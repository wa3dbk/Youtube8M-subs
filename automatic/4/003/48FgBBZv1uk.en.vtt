first vintage collection action figure

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.139 
first vintage collection action figure
so<00:01:52.909> it's<00:01:53.909> good<00:01:54.270> closer<00:01:54.750> look<00:01:54.990> at<00:01:55.140> its<00:01:55.229> face<00:01:55.500> I

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
so it's good closer look at its face I

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:58.969 
so it's good closer look at its face I
have<00:01:57.149> a<00:01:57.240> couple<00:01:57.570> galen<00:01:58.140> marek<00:01:58.290> star<00:01:58.799> killer

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.649 
have a couple galen marek star killer
figures<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.119> I<00:02:00.149> would<00:02:00.270> say<00:02:00.360> this<00:02:00.479> is<00:02:00.600> probably

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
figures and I would say this is probably

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.289 
figures and I would say this is probably
the<00:02:01.020> best<00:02:01.229> representation<00:02:01.619> of<00:02:01.950> his<00:02:02.040> face

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
the best representation of his face

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:07.280 
the best representation of his face
Nomad<00:02:03.299> exactly<00:02:03.810> spot-on<00:02:04.110> but<00:02:04.700> close<00:02:06.290> much
