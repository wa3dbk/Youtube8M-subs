00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
muscles coming out of muscles I don't

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.730 
muscles coming out of muscles I don't
even<00:00:27.689> know<00:00:27.840> why<00:00:28.019> you<00:00:28.080> would<00:00:28.289> want<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.529> look

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
even know why you would want to look

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.320 
even know why you would want to look
like<00:00:28.920> that<00:00:29.130> I<00:00:29.429> guess<00:00:29.699> it's<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:29.910> personal

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
like that I guess it's a personal

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.470 
like that I guess it's a personal
preference<00:00:30.599> but<00:00:31.369> it<00:00:32.369> really<00:00:32.610> hampered<00:00:33.210> his

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
preference but it really hampered his

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.209 
preference but it really hampered his
his<00:00:33.960> in-ring<00:00:34.140> ability<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:34.860> he<00:00:34.980> could<00:00:35.130> still

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
his in-ring ability and he could still

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.799 
his in-ring ability and he could still
go<00:00:35.430> out<00:00:35.460> there<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:35.940> have<00:00:36.030> good<00:00:36.180> matches<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:36.750> I

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
go out there and have good matches and I

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.290 
go out there and have good matches and I
remember<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.260> later<00:00:37.500> years<00:00:37.770> in<00:00:37.920> TNA<00:00:38.309> so

always<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.119> big<00:01:15.450> guy<00:01:15.720> Scott<00:01:16.200> Steiner<00:01:16.470> in<00:01:16.770> 1991

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
always a big guy Scott Steiner in 1991

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.280 
always a big guy Scott Steiner in 1991
was<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.759> big<00:01:18.030> guy<00:01:18.210> but<00:01:18.390> he<00:01:18.540> was<00:01:18.659> nowhere<00:01:18.900> near<00:01:19.080> as

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
was a big guy but he was nowhere near as

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.740 
was a big guy but he was nowhere near as
big<00:01:19.590> as<00:01:19.710> Scott<00:01:19.920> Steiner<00:01:20.250> in<00:01:20.490> 1998<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.390> mean<00:01:21.630> not

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
big as Scott Steiner in 1998 I mean not

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.899 
big as Scott Steiner in 1998 I mean not
even<00:01:21.780> close<00:01:22.700> not<00:01:23.700> as<00:01:23.880> agile<00:01:24.420> not<00:01:24.720> as<00:01:24.810> quick<00:01:25.909> so

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
even close not as agile not as quick so

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.899 
even close not as agile not as quick so
I<00:01:27.470> mean<00:01:28.470> that's<00:01:28.560> really<00:01:28.979> why<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.250> happened<00:01:29.729> and

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
I mean that's really why it happened and

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.880 
I mean that's really why it happened and
yeah<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.540> was<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.689> pretty<00:01:30.930> rapid<00:01:31.350> descent<00:01:31.740> from

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
yeah it was a pretty rapid descent from

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.440 
yeah it was a pretty rapid descent from
where<00:01:32.100> he<00:01:32.250> had<00:01:32.400> been<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.850> where<00:01:33.000> he<00:01:33.150> would<00:01:33.299> end

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
where he had been to where he would end

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.230 
where he had been to where he would end
up<00:01:33.979> funny<00:01:34.979> thing<00:01:35.189> about<00:01:35.220> that<00:01:35.460> though<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:35.909> say

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
up funny thing about that though you say

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.940 
up funny thing about that though you say
in<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.540> early<00:01:36.780> 90s<00:01:37.200> he<00:01:37.320> was<00:01:37.350> one<00:01:37.590> of<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.770> best

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
in the early 90s he was one of the best
