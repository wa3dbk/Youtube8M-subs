looks<00:00:46.829> good<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:47.610> has<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.450> nice<00:00:48.719> presentation

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
looks good it has a nice presentation

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:53.720 
looks good it has a nice presentation
it's<00:00:51.149> just<00:00:51.390> another<00:00:51.660> variation<00:00:52.110> of<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:53.039> v60

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
it's just another variation of the v60

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.319 
it's just another variation of the v60
dripper<00:00:54.590> so<00:00:55.590> it's<00:00:55.980> pretty<00:00:56.190> much<00:00:56.309> that<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:57.059> use

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
dripper so it's pretty much that you use

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.939 
dripper so it's pretty much that you use
it<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.629> same<00:00:57.840> you'd<00:00:58.680> put<00:01:00.140> 30<00:01:01.140> grams<00:01:01.469> of<00:01:01.649> caught

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
it the same you'd put 30 grams of caught

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.140 
it the same you'd put 30 grams of caught
ground<00:01:02.250> coffee<00:01:02.550> on<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.780> finer<00:01:03.989> side<00:01:04.350> and<00:01:05.150> 450

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
ground coffee on the finer side and 450

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.469 
ground coffee on the finer side and 450
grams<00:01:06.420> of<00:01:06.630> water<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:07.229> brew<00:01:07.760> a<00:01:08.760> couple

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
grams of water to brew a couple

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.750 
grams of water to brew a couple
