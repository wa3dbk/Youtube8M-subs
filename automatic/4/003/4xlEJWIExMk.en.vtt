separately with my bracelet because that

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.050 
separately with my bracelet because that
way<00:02:10.200> if<00:02:10.410> by<00:02:10.590> any<00:02:10.649> chance<00:02:10.770> my<00:02:11.160> thread<00:02:11.910> would

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
break at my clasp my whole bracelet is

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.580 
break at my clasp my whole bracelet is
not<00:02:14.400> going<00:02:14.550> to<00:02:14.610> come<00:02:14.730> apart<00:02:15.140> so<00:02:16.140> I've<00:02:16.260> had<00:02:16.440> my

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
not going to come apart so I've had my

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.250 
not going to come apart so I've had my
needle<00:02:16.860> on<00:02:17.010> one<00:02:17.280> direction<00:02:18.020> going<00:02:19.020> one<00:02:19.230> way

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
needle on one direction going one way

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.410 
needle on one direction going one way
I'm<00:02:20.100> going<00:02:20.310> to<00:02:20.370> fold<00:02:20.520> the<00:02:20.640> tail<00:02:20.820> it<00:02:20.970> over<00:02:21.270> in

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
I'm going to fold the tail it over in

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.500 
I'm going to fold the tail it over in
place<00:02:22.490> just<00:02:23.490> because<00:02:23.700> it<00:02:23.850> makes<00:02:23.970> it<00:02:24.120> easier<00:02:24.390> to

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
place just because it makes it easier to

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.880 
place just because it makes it easier to
hold<00:02:24.660> and<00:02:24.870> I'm<00:02:25.380> going<00:02:25.500> to<00:02:25.530> take<00:02:25.710> my<00:02:25.830> needle

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
hold and I'm going to take my needle

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.560 
hold and I'm going to take my needle
through<00:02:26.130> in<00:02:27.050> the<00:02:28.050> opposite<00:02:28.470> direction<00:02:29.570> again

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
through in the opposite direction again

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:31.820 
through in the opposite direction again
pull<00:02:30.840> the<00:02:30.930> thread<00:02:31.170> through<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.410> whole<00:02:31.650> way

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
pull the thread through the whole way

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.500 
pull the thread through the whole way
and<00:02:33.290> that<00:02:34.290> will<00:02:34.410> force<00:02:34.680> it<00:02:34.800> to<00:02:34.950> lay<00:02:35.270> right<00:02:36.270> over

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
and that will force it to lay right over

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.930 
and that will force it to lay right over
the<00:02:36.630> top<00:02:36.810> again<00:02:37.460> I'm<00:02:38.460> going<00:02:38.610> to<00:02:38.700> continue

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
the top again I'm going to continue

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.180 
the top again I'm going to continue
doing<00:02:39.390> this<00:02:39.570> the<00:02:40.050> next<00:02:40.260> time<00:02:40.380> that<00:02:40.860> I<00:02:40.890> go<00:02:40.950> in<00:02:41.130> a

ended was with the Tila I go through the
next<00:03:20.010> hole<00:03:21.320> going<00:03:22.320> the<00:03:22.380> opposite<00:03:22.739> direction

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.300 
next hole going the opposite direction

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.430 
next hole going the opposite direction
and<00:03:24.300> give<00:03:24.450> it<00:03:24.540> a<00:03:24.570> pull<00:03:24.750> tone<00:03:24.930> that's<00:03:25.200> just

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
and give it a pull tone that's just

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.960 
and give it a pull tone that's just
going<00:03:25.560> to<00:03:25.620> create<00:03:25.860> my<00:03:26.040> little<00:03:26.280> dip<00:03:26.580> there<00:03:26.610> I
