 started an hour late because 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.810
 the fog is affecting the first 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.840
 the world cup race the giant 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.640

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.630
 second run as said has begun 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.270
 with an hour delay the organizers 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:37.649
 have postponed the start of the second 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:40.100
 fraction twice the second run was 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:45.120

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:48.239
 13 and 15 and then the final route at 13 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.670
 and 45 the organizers who eventually 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.420
 have decided to give the green light for 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.239
 the departure the fog remains 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.940
 although less dense than one 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:01.219
 half an hour face is also a light one 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.399
 sleet which also creates problems of 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:07.090
 visibility really to the athletes 

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:10.009
 especially with regards to 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:12.229
 glasses in this second run already 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:15.380
 two blue went out nadia 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:17.360
 Kurdish little children and irene I have to read 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.060
 together, kind hearers 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:24.259
 what happened instead in the first one 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:27.500
 fraction with partial victory at least 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:30.500
 in the first run of the Slovenian tina 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:34.670
 maze in front of the French 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.950
 then I would like the German rebensburg e 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.409
 detached of a little more than a second 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.470
 second then the Austrian the first of the 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:44.840
 austriache catherine zeta 159 the first 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.240
 instead of the blue is denise karbon 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:51.950
 excellent the test of karbon on the fifth 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:54.140
 placed at 162 and at the other the maze 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.799
 blue federica brignone eighth 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.680
 located just over two seconds from the dal 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:03.619
 from the Slovenian then we talked about the 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.280
 while others of the other athletes meanwhile are going to 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:06.079
 take away 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.140
 the American Lindsay vonn is one of the 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:11.570
 great protagonists of the white circus 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.970
 among other things, the cup holder 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:17.180
 of the absolute world not a first run 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.630
 certainly at his level for the American who 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:23.269
 they had last won right here at 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.920
 well out of the race that really works one 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:27.350
 second run I mean wrong 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.049
 many victims emanuele the fog 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.030
 is creating many problems at 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:34.040
 we will see to the athletes now 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.720
 meanwhile during the second run 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.819
 I am giving you back line between resend 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.890
 little we feel soon for a 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.900
 further update to the fog ai 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.180
 steep hills drizzling cup salt of 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.580
 world a solden in tyrol in austria a 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.530
 short update from our correspondent 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.780
 emilio mancuso here we are also 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.450
 federica brignone slipped on this 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.010
 snow soap bar outside another blue and 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.470
 this second run after nadia 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.420
 walk a Russian roulette race 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:01.280
 in the partial ranking of the second 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.200
 the first of the blue irene to run 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.450
 Curtones in fourth place ranking 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.640
 Partial of the second round he led 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:11.630
 by the Austrian 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:14.090
 in seven there are 66 athletes are 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.980
 still remained to complete this 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.900
 so second run will soon come down 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.940
 among other things denise karbon fifth after the 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.070
 first first fraction we feel between 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:24.020
 little for the final result tele line 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.750
 we must return to solden in austria for 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:28.880
 know how this second is going e 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.400
 decisive even our emilio sent 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.590
 mancuso si here we are distorted race 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.290
 really from the fog from the risk that 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.270
 greatly reduces the visibility for 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.050
 athletes have recently advocated the 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:43.370
 the Austrian zettel is the goal 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.260
 jumped to the top of the rankings 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:49.280
 partial of this second run 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:52.550
 the Austrian zettel really exhausted z 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:55.190
 in front of the detached compatriot of a 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.739
 according to 29 a little while ago the last one fell 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:00.310
 blue race denise karbon thirteenth 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:02.570
 time in the second run a for 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:05.450
 the blue that now in the ranking 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:08.300
 partial and sixth front 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:11.060
 the other Italian irene irene curtoni 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:14.959
 the German is coming down now 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:17.930
 rebensburg therefore remained in three a 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:20.480
 go down fog always as thick as 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.160

 from you with the hope that someone 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.940
 complete this second one 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.280
 complete this second run of time 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:42.620
 to connect with solden in tirolo in 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.419
 austria to go and hear from emilio 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.400
 how the first ended 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:48.830
 world cup test that won 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.770
 here we are and the first victory in Slovenia 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:54.500
 of this edition of the world cup 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.900
 the giant slalom here on the glacier 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.830
 straight to the money bank went to the 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.190
 Slovenian 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:05.480
 tina maze who came down cautiously 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:09.110
 managed the wide advantage of 159 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:11.480
 on the zettel and finished first 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.910
 with 42 hundredths of a second advantage 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:16.190
 just about the Austrian on po 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:19.820
 another Austrian is Stefano 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:22.880
 as for the seventh blue and 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:25.130
 eighth place for denise karbon irene 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.020
 curton the coal that closed the 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:31.850
 first run in fifth place 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:34.660
 2 73 while the curtose of 282 for how much 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:36.950
 regards the other Italian ones 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:39.260
 therefore we remember the twenty-first place 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:41.480
 far away from the first of lisa agerer 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:44.000
 while in the second round I am 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:47.060
 federica brignone and nadia exits 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.210
 second fanchini as he said it 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:52.190
 really elimination study outside the 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:54.890
 French I wish he was in second place 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:57.230
 after the first run and outside the German 

00:05:54.890 --> 00:06:00.020
 rebensburg fourth after the first run 

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:02.870
 black day also for lindsay vonn la 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:05.720
 American champion slipped into 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:08.150
 this second run conditioned like 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:11.330
 said several times by the very thick fog 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:13.640
 and also from the intense sleet it has 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:17.890
 definitely given very very much trouble 

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:17.890
 for visibility to athletes
