00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
guys find this is a big data problem so

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.320 
guys find this is a big data problem so
Jake<00:02:25.350> used<00:02:25.620> our<00:02:25.770> new<00:02:25.920> Teradata<00:02:26.460> aster<00:02:26.940> system

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
Jake used our new Teradata aster system

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.720 
Jake used our new Teradata aster system
to<00:02:27.480> dig<00:02:27.660> into<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:27.990> details<00:02:28.440> we<00:02:29.220> started<00:02:29.640> with

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
to dig into the details we started with

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.150 
to dig into the details we started with
ops<00:02:30.000> data<00:02:30.330> and<00:02:30.600> map<00:02:30.870> that<00:02:30.900> to<00:02:31.290> customers<00:02:31.830> so<00:02:31.980> we

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
ops data and map that to customers so we

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.640 
ops data and map that to customers so we
know<00:02:32.310> who<00:02:32.490> calls<00:02:32.790> whom<00:02:33.090> then<00:02:33.960> we<00:02:34.140> created<00:02:34.500> a

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
know who calls whom then we created a

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.800 
know who calls whom then we created a
connection<00:02:34.950> graph<00:02:35.460> here's<00:02:36.090> a<00:02:36.180> sample<00:02:36.630> for

then weight the links by number of

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.220 
then weight the links by number of
dropped<00:02:50.310> calls<00:02:50.640> in<00:02:51.000> red<00:02:51.750> you<00:02:52.050> can<00:02:52.200> see

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
dropped calls in red you can see

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.640 
dropped calls in red you can see

customer pairs impacted by dropped calls

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.230 
customer pairs impacted by dropped calls
then<00:02:55.650> we<00:02:55.860> added<00:02:56.040> customer<00:02:56.700> lifetime<00:02:56.970> value

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
then we added customer lifetime value

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.990 
then we added customer lifetime value
scores<00:02:58.050> bigger<00:02:58.890> nodes<00:02:59.220> indicate<00:02:59.460> more
