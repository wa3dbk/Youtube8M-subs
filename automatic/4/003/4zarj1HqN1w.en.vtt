00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:06.440 
all right so this is the KC 110 hit bike

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.280 
all right so this is the KC 110 hit bike
it<00:00:07.440> was<00:00:07.529> originally<00:00:07.890> sold<00:00:08.040> at<00:00:08.160> Pep<00:00:08.309> Boys<00:00:08.750> and<00:00:09.750> I

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
it was originally sold at Pep Boys and I

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.249 
it was originally sold at Pep Boys and I
bought<00:00:10.440> off<00:00:10.559> a<00:00:10.590> Craigslist<00:00:11.429> a<00:00:11.580> few<00:00:11.700> months<00:00:11.910> ago

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:12.259 
bought off a Craigslist a few months ago

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:18.460 
bought off a Craigslist a few months ago
and<00:00:13.259> just<00:00:13.679> did<00:00:13.950> a<00:00:14.540> bunch<00:00:15.540> of<00:00:15.660> upgrades<00:00:15.990> to<00:00:16.230> it

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:18.470 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.970 

in<00:00:19.470> some<00:00:19.859> of<00:00:19.920> my<00:00:20.010> previous<00:00:20.070> reviews<00:00:20.730> I<00:00:21.980> had

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
in some of my previous reviews I had

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.080 
in some of my previous reviews I had
that<00:00:23.189> SSR<00:00:23.760> 125<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:26.720> compared<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:27.960> that<00:00:28.109> it<00:00:28.560> is

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
that SSR 125 and compared to that it is

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.880 
that SSR 125 and compared to that it is
almost<00:00:30.090> exactly<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.990> same<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.349> plastics<00:00:31.769> are

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
almost exactly the same the plastics are

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.630 
almost exactly the same the plastics are
the<00:00:31.980> same<00:00:32.600> the<00:00:33.600> frame<00:00:34.350> is<00:00:34.770> slightly<00:00:35.070> different

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
the same the frame is slightly different

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.030 
the same the frame is slightly different
the<00:00:36.420> engine<00:00:36.899> is<00:00:37.020> almost<00:00:37.200> exactly<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.829> same

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
the engine is almost exactly the same

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:45.940 
the engine is almost exactly the same
except<00:00:38.430> this<00:00:38.520> one<00:00:38.730> is<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.559> 110<00:00:40.559> CC<00:00:43.820> forks<00:00:44.899> are

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:45.950 
except this one is the 110 CC forks are

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.830 
except this one is the 110 CC forks are
probably<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.129> same<00:00:47.160> they<00:00:47.820> look<00:00:48.300> exactly<00:00:48.570> the

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
probably the same they look exactly the

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.560 
probably the same they look exactly the
same<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.620> swing<00:00:49.829> arm<00:00:49.980> is<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:51.059> normal<00:00:51.390> style

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
same the swing arm is the normal style

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.000 
same the swing arm is the normal style
swing<00:00:51.870> arm<00:00:52.079> it's<00:00:52.829> not<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.280> a-frame<00:00:54.120> like<00:00:54.480> the

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
swing arm it's not the a-frame like the

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:00.740 
swing arm it's not the a-frame like the
SSR<00:00:56.010> was<00:00:56.039> I'm<00:00:57.000> not<00:00:57.510> I<00:00:58.850> didn't<00:00:59.850> to<00:00:59.940> do<00:01:00.359> too<00:01:00.629> many

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
SSR was I'm not I didn't to do too many

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.470 
SSR was I'm not I didn't to do too many
upgrades<00:01:01.020> I<00:01:01.379> just<00:01:01.590> stained<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.100> exhaust<00:01:02.480> put

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
upgrades I just stained the exhaust put

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.440 
upgrades I just stained the exhaust put
on<00:01:03.920> this<00:01:04.920> air<00:01:05.610> cleaner<00:01:06.950> and<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:08.700> had<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.090> tune<00:01:09.299> it

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
on this air cleaner and I had to tune it

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.500 
on this air cleaner and I had to tune it
to<00:01:09.600> run<00:01:09.750> at<00:01:09.930> half<00:01:10.430> half<00:01:11.430> choke<00:01:11.850> all<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.299> time

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
to run at half half choke all the time

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.130 
to run at half half choke all the time
because<00:01:13.100> at<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.580> lower<00:01:14.939> choke<00:01:15.240> like<00:01:15.780> without

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
because at the lower choke like without

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.210 
because at the lower choke like without
a<00:01:16.290> choke<00:01:16.530> on<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:17.180> it<00:01:18.180> wouldn't<00:01:18.390> even<00:01:18.650> run<00:01:19.650> like

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
a choke on it it wouldn't even run like

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.429 
a choke on it it wouldn't even run like
it<00:01:20.909> would<00:01:21.060> just<00:01:21.090> spit<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:21.780> sputter<00:01:22.020> all<00:01:22.320> the

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
it would just spit and sputter all the

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.219 
it would just spit and sputter all the
time<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:23.130> I<00:01:23.610> play<00:01:23.820> with<00:01:23.850> it<00:01:24.119> so<00:01:24.540> much<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:25.080> try

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
time and I play with it so much to try

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.510 
time and I play with it so much to try
to<00:01:25.259> get<00:01:25.470> to<00:01:25.560> work<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:25.890> I<00:01:25.950> just<00:01:25.979> couldn't<00:01:26.369> get

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
to get to work and I just couldn't get

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.330 
to get to work and I just couldn't get
it<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:27.270> run<00:01:27.390> properly<00:01:27.659> so<00:01:28.140> I<00:01:28.409> set<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.220> half

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
it to run properly so I set to half

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.890 
it to run properly so I set to half
choke<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:29.790> I<00:01:29.820> tuned<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.240> that<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:30.720> runs

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
choke and I tuned it to that and it runs

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:37.460 
choke and I tuned it to that and it runs
fine<00:01:31.820> I<00:01:32.820> got<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.780> AMSOIL<00:01:35.509> graphics<00:01:36.509> kit<00:01:36.659> for

quick<00:02:11.540> walk<00:02:11.750> around<00:02:11.780> it<00:02:12.080> because<00:02:12.290> I<00:02:12.379> hadn't

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
quick walk around it because I hadn't

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.869 
quick walk around it because I hadn't
seen<00:02:12.709> too<00:02:12.860> many<00:02:12.920> reviews<00:02:13.370> on<00:02:13.549> YouTube<00:02:13.670> of<00:02:13.970> it<00:02:14.530> I

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879 
seen too many reviews on YouTube of it I

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:22.660 
seen too many reviews on YouTube of it I
got<00:02:16.879> Scott<00:02:17.390> grips<00:02:17.660> to<00:02:19.930> with<00:02:20.930> a<00:02:21.280> moose<00:02:22.280> grip

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670
