we start turning up the volume doesn't
necessarily<00:02:12.630> get<00:02:12.750> all<00:02:12.989> that<00:02:13.260> much<00:02:13.410> louder<00:02:13.590> to

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
necessarily get all that much louder to

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:29.650 
necessarily get all that much louder to
those<00:02:14.520> the<00:02:14.730> game

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.229 

I'm<00:02:30.660> gonna<00:02:30.810> turn<00:02:30.959> the<00:02:31.110> volume<00:02:31.230> up<00:02:31.590> to<00:02:31.800> five<00:02:32.239> or

I'm gonna turn the volume up to five or

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:44.390 
I'm gonna turn the volume up to five or
right<00:02:36.769> it's<00:02:37.769> really<00:02:37.890> pushing<00:02:38.519> the<00:02:38.819> amp<00:02:43.400> but

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
right it's really pushing the amp but

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.059 
right it's really pushing the amp but
it's<00:02:44.519> not<00:02:44.700> really<00:02:45.090> getting<00:02:45.360> the<00:02:45.739> type<00:02:46.739> of<00:02:46.769> tone

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
it's not really getting the type of tone

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:53.470 
it's not really getting the type of tone
I<00:02:47.310> would<00:02:47.459> look<00:02:47.610> for<00:02:47.910> and<00:02:48.810> the<00:02:48.900> crank<00:02:49.140> the<00:02:49.230> toes

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:03:02.410 

are<00:02:54.480> they<00:02:54.599> up<00:02:54.720> all<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:55.019> way<00:02:55.110> up

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.580 

and<00:03:03.420> back<00:03:03.780> down<00:03:03.810> about<00:03:06.050> three<00:03:07.050> o'clock<00:03:07.320> now

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
and back down about three o'clock now

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.260 
and back down about three o'clock now
say<00:03:08.220> about<00:03:08.550> two<00:03:08.850> o'clock<00:03:09.500> and<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:11.070> tone<00:03:11.310> and

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
say about two o'clock and the tone and

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:48.160 
say about two o'clock and the tone and
about<00:03:12.840> 3:30

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.470 

so<00:03:49.640> it's<00:03:50.640> kind<00:03:50.849> of<00:03:50.879> interesting<00:03:51.360> with

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
so it's kind of interesting with

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.280 
so it's kind of interesting with
boutique<00:03:51.870> speakers<00:03:53.090> but<00:03:54.090> not<00:03:54.420> necessarily

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
boutique speakers but not necessarily

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.470 
boutique speakers but not necessarily
what<00:03:55.410> I'm<00:03:55.500> looking<00:03:55.709> for<00:03:55.890> for<00:03:56.400> this<00:03:56.580> amp<00:03:56.940> anyway

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
what I'm looking for for this amp anyway

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.440 
what I'm looking for for this amp anyway
that's<00:03:58.319> that
