lateral incisor to the canine 3 the
first<00:03:42.620> premolar<00:03:43.220> for<00:03:43.720> second<00:03:44.720> premolar<00:03:45.109> five

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
first premolar for second premolar five

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:50.399 
first premolar for second premolar five
first<00:03:46.519> molar<00:03:46.909> six<00:03:47.419> and<00:03:47.689> second<00:03:48.680> molar<00:03:48.879> seven

00:03:50.399 --> 00:03:50.409 
first molar six and second molar seven

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:54.699 
first molar six and second molar seven
for<00:03:51.409> example<00:03:52.299> the<00:03:53.299> upper<00:03:53.540> left<00:03:53.989> canine<00:03:54.290> as

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
for example the upper left canine as

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:58.629 
for example the upper left canine as
pointed<00:03:55.579> with<00:03:55.760> the<00:03:55.909> laser<00:03:56.150> and<00:03:56.540> arrow<00:03:57.169> is<00:03:57.639> in

00:03:58.629 --> 00:03:58.639 
pointed with the laser and arrow is in

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:02.409 
pointed with the laser and arrow is in
the<00:03:58.790> second<00:03:59.329> quadrant<00:03:59.629> and<00:04:00.729> is<00:04:01.729> the<00:04:02.120> third

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:02.419 
the second quadrant and is the third

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:05.490 
the second quadrant and is the third
tooth<00:04:02.840> counting<00:04:03.470> from<00:04:03.739> a<00:04:03.889> mesial<00:04:04.310> direction

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
tooth counting from a mesial direction

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.159 
tooth counting from a mesial direction
therefore<00:04:06.500> the<00:04:07.370> upper<00:04:07.729> left<00:04:07.970> canine<00:04:08.239> is<00:04:08.659> given

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:09.169 
therefore the upper left canine is given

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:13.449 
therefore the upper left canine is given
international<00:04:09.949> tooth<00:04:10.250> two<00:04:10.879> three
