it's not a glove it's more just one
solid<00:01:22.710> piece<00:01:22.980> of<00:01:23.010> this<00:01:23.910> plastic<00:01:24.150> that<00:01:24.570> lays<00:01:24.870> on

disposable they're affordable so it's

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.610

big recycler so I don't really know how
great<00:02:06.970> these<00:02:07.090> are<00:02:07.270> for<00:02:07.479> the<00:02:07.570> environment<00:02:08.080> I

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
great these are for the environment I

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.290 
great these are for the environment I
did<00:02:08.410> not<00:02:08.619> ask<00:02:08.860> that<00:02:09.130> question<00:02:09.580> so<00:02:09.849> that's<00:02:10.060> one

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
did not ask that question so that's one

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.070 
did not ask that question so that's one
other<00:02:10.599> thing<00:02:10.959> to<00:02:11.170> consider<00:02:12.569> so<00:02:13.569> the<00:02:13.660> cost<00:02:13.900> of

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
other thing to consider so the cost of

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.949 
other thing to consider so the cost of
these<00:02:14.290> I<00:02:14.349> think<00:02:14.590> is<00:02:15.190> about<00:02:15.670> I<00:02:16.330> think<00:02:16.750> you<00:02:16.840> can

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
these I think is about I think you can

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.320 
these I think is about I think you can
get<00:02:17.080> 20<00:02:17.560> of<00:02:17.590> them<00:02:17.920> 20<00:02:18.310> of<00:02:18.370> the<00:02:18.459> shields<00:02:18.819> for<00:02:18.970> 40

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
get 20 of them 20 of the shields for 40

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.500 
get 20 of them 20 of the shields for 40
dollars<00:02:19.480> or<00:02:19.870> 40<00:02:20.140> 95<00:02:20.590> and<00:02:20.980> then<00:02:21.459> 80<00:02:21.760> of<00:02:21.970> them<00:02:22.180> for

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
dollars or 40 95 and then 80 of them for

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.100 
dollars or 40 95 and then 80 of them for
90<00:02:22.930> 95<00:02:23.290> and<00:02:23.890> so<00:02:24.819> that<00:02:25.030> makes<00:02:25.269> them<00:02:25.540> about

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
90 95 and so that makes them about

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.320 
90 95 and so that makes them about
anywhere<00:02:26.620> from<00:02:26.739> a<00:02:26.830> dollar<00:02:26.980> 14<00:02:27.580> apiece<00:02:27.910> and<00:02:28.150> up

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
anywhere from a dollar 14 apiece and up

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.330 
anywhere from a dollar 14 apiece and up
so<00:02:28.599> you<00:02:28.660> could<00:02:28.989> get<00:02:29.380> away<00:02:29.530> with<00:02:29.800> using<00:02:30.010> one<00:02:30.310> of

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
so you could get away with using one of

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.330 
so you could get away with using one of
these<00:02:30.519> per<00:02:31.000> clients<00:02:31.870> if<00:02:32.019> you<00:02:32.200> reuse<00:02:32.680> it<00:02:33.130> on

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
these per clients if you reuse it on

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.370 
these per clients if you reuse it on
both<00:02:34.120> of<00:02:34.330> their<00:02:34.480> hands<00:02:34.690> or<00:02:34.930> both<00:02:35.080> of<00:02:35.230> their

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
both of their hands or both of their

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.890 
both of their hands or both of their
feet<00:02:35.620> or<00:02:36.069> you<00:02:36.400> would<00:02:36.670> use<00:02:36.850> two<00:02:37.150> per<00:02:37.480> man<00:02:37.660> I'm

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.500 
exposed and the rest of my hand is
covered<00:03:26.260> so<00:03:26.950> I<00:03:26.980> could<00:03:27.519> if<00:03:27.730> I<00:03:27.880> were<00:03:28.060> doing<00:03:28.329> a

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
covered so I could if I were doing a

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.259 
covered so I could if I were doing a
manicure<00:03:29.019> and<00:03:29.350> I<00:03:29.590> wanted<00:03:29.829> to<00:03:29.890> cure<00:03:30.549> my<00:03:30.760> nails<00:03:31.000> I

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
manicure and I wanted to cure my nails I

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:34.110 
manicure and I wanted to cure my nails I
would<00:03:31.390> slide<00:03:31.690> my<00:03:31.870> hand<00:03:32.140> into<00:03:32.530> the<00:03:32.560> light<00:03:33.120> and

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
would slide my hand into the light and

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.830 
would slide my hand into the light and
my<00:03:34.810> hand<00:03:35.049> is<00:03:35.230> protected<00:03:36.190> from<00:03:36.489> that<00:03:36.819> from<00:03:37.720> the

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
my hand is protected from that from the

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:45.270 
my hand is protected from that from the
UV<00:03:38.170> rays<00:03:39.630> so<00:03:41.790> it's<00:03:42.790> a<00:03:42.880> little<00:03:43.060> bit<00:03:43.889> clumsy<00:03:44.889> if

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
UV rays so it's a little bit clumsy if

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.979 
UV rays so it's a little bit clumsy if
you<00:03:45.459> ask<00:03:45.639> me<00:03:45.880> that<00:03:45.910> this<00:03:46.709> shield<00:03:47.709> kind<00:03:48.459> of<00:03:48.989> it

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
you ask me that this shield kind of it

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:51.720 
you ask me that this shield kind of it
just<00:03:50.200> lays<00:03:50.410> on<00:03:50.620> top<00:03:50.859> of<00:03:51.040> your<00:03:51.190> hands<00:03:51.489> so<00:03:51.549> if

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
just lays on top of your hands so if

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.039 
just lays on top of your hands so if
your<00:03:51.850> clients<00:03:52.239> are<00:03:52.299> moving<00:03:52.600> around<00:03:52.690> or<00:03:52.989> if

your clients are moving around or if

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:54.300 
your clients are moving around or if
you're<00:03:53.200> moving<00:03:53.500> around<00:03:53.620> a<00:03:53.799> lot<00:03:53.950> it's<00:03:54.130> gonna

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
you're moving around a lot it's gonna

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.340 
you're moving around a lot it's gonna
just<00:03:54.579> sort<00:03:54.760> of<00:03:55.319> flap<00:03:56.319> around<00:03:56.500> a<00:03:56.829> little<00:03:56.950> bit

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
just sort of flap around a little bit

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.809 
just sort of flap around a little bit
but<00:03:59.350> you<00:03:59.739> know<00:03:59.799> if<00:03:59.980> your<00:04:00.100> clients<00:04:00.430> are<00:04:00.489> sitting

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
but you know if your clients are sitting

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:03.030 
but you know if your clients are sitting
still<00:04:01.060> shouldn't<00:04:01.569> be<00:04:01.660> a<00:04:01.690> problem<00:04:01.870> but<00:04:02.680> and<00:04:02.950> we

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
still shouldn't be a problem but and we

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.770 
still shouldn't be a problem but and we
know<00:04:03.160> not<00:04:03.400> everybody's<00:04:03.819> capable<00:04:04.239> of<00:04:04.569> sitting

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
know not everybody's capable of sitting

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.500 
know not everybody's capable of sitting
still<00:04:04.900> and<00:04:05.440> the<00:04:06.010> other<00:04:06.190> problem<00:04:06.730> that<00:04:07.030> I<00:04:07.060> have

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
still and the other problem that I have

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.180 
still and the other problem that I have
with<00:04:07.660> this<00:04:07.780> is<00:04:07.840> that<00:04:08.079> it<00:04:08.260> limits<00:04:08.799> your

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
with this is that it limits your

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.300 
with this is that it limits your
mobility<00:04:10.000> your<00:04:10.569> a<00:04:10.930> ability<00:04:11.620> to<00:04:11.980> move<00:04:12.130> your

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
mobility your a ability to move your

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.000 
mobility your a ability to move your
fingers<00:04:12.700> so<00:04:12.909> I<00:04:12.939> can't<00:04:13.239> really

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
fingers so I can't really

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.009 
fingers so I can't really
really<00:04:14.250> have<00:04:14.400> use<00:04:14.670> of<00:04:14.700> my<00:04:14.879> hand<00:04:15.269> which<00:04:15.989> you

what I do my mom's nails I kind of like

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:33.770 
what I do my mom's nails I kind of like
to<00:04:31.669> isolate<00:04:32.669> a<00:04:32.699> finger<00:04:33.060> at<00:04:33.150> a<00:04:33.210> time<00:04:33.240> so<00:04:33.600> it's<00:04:33.720> a

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 
to isolate a finger at a time so it's a

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.000 
to isolate a finger at a time so it's a
little<00:04:33.990> hard<00:04:34.199> for<00:04:34.260> me<00:04:34.470> to<00:04:34.590> get<00:04:34.800> in-between

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
little hard for me to get in-between

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.980 
little hard for me to get in-between
those<00:04:35.610> fingers<00:04:36.000> and<00:04:36.180> it's<00:04:36.270> this<00:04:36.600> is<00:04:36.720> actually

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
those fingers and it's this is actually

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.510 
those fingers and it's this is actually
very<00:04:37.169> hard<00:04:37.380> to<00:04:37.470> demonstrate<00:04:37.590> on<00:04:38.039> myself<00:04:38.190> at

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
very hard to demonstrate on myself at

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.610 
very hard to demonstrate on myself at
this<00:04:38.639> angle<00:04:38.760> but<00:04:39.120> you<00:04:39.389> know<00:04:39.990> imagine<00:04:40.380> the

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
this angle but you know imagine the

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.140 
this angle but you know imagine the
client<00:04:41.039> sitting<00:04:41.220> there<00:04:41.460> and<00:04:41.669> trying<00:04:41.910> to

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
client sitting there and trying to

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.270 
client sitting there and trying to
isolate<00:04:42.900> each<00:04:43.410> finger<00:04:43.770> and<00:04:43.800> might<00:04:44.039> it's<00:04:44.190> a

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
isolate each finger and might it's a

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.170 
isolate each finger and might it's a
little<00:04:44.550> it<00:04:44.669> makes<00:04:44.820> it<00:04:44.910> a<00:04:44.940> little<00:04:45.030> more

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
little it makes it a little more

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.310 
little it makes it a little more
complicated<00:04:45.600> but<00:04:47.539> this<00:04:48.539> type<00:04:48.750> of<00:04:48.780> product

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
complicated but this type of product

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.770 
complicated but this type of product
could<00:04:49.650> definitely<00:04:49.830> put<00:04:50.190> your<00:04:50.370> clients<00:04:50.820> minds

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
could definitely put your clients minds

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.570 
could definitely put your clients minds
at<00:04:52.020> ease<00:04:52.289> and<00:04:52.590> they<00:04:52.949> might<00:04:53.130> feel<00:04:53.340> more

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
at ease and they might feel more

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.439 
at ease and they might feel more
protected<00:04:54.110> so<00:04:55.110> this<00:04:55.289> is<00:04:55.620> a<00:04:55.830> good<00:04:56.190> option<00:04:56.520> and

00:04:57.439 --> 00:04:57.449 
protected so this is a good option and

00:04:57.449 --> 00:04:59.360 
protected so this is a good option and
I'm<00:04:57.690> going<00:04:57.810> to<00:04:57.870> show<00:04:58.020> you<00:04:58.080> real<00:04:58.320> quick<00:04:58.560> to

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
I'm going to show you real quick to

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.090 
I'm going to show you real quick to
other<00:04:59.639> solutions<00:05:00.449> that<00:05:01.139> you<00:05:01.590> might<00:05:01.800> also

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100 
other solutions that you might also

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:08.090 
other solutions that you might also
consider<00:05:02.310> I<00:05:04.010> also<00:05:05.010> have<00:05:05.460> this<00:05:06.389> is<00:05:06.630> a<00:05:06.870> UV<00:05:07.620> glove

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 
consider I also have this is a UV glove

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.930 
consider I also have this is a UV glove
which<00:05:08.970> offers<00:05:09.360> the<00:05:09.389> same<00:05:09.720> type<00:05:09.960> of<00:05:09.990> protection

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 
which offers the same type of protection

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.450 
which offers the same type of protection
this<00:05:11.940> is<00:05:12.300> a<00:05:12.600> reusable<00:05:13.139> product<00:05:13.800> so<00:05:14.070> I<00:05:14.100> think

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
this is a reusable product so I think

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.830 
this is a reusable product so I think
this<00:05:14.639> is<00:05:14.820> more<00:05:15.530> a<00:05:17.270> better<00:05:18.270> solution<00:05:18.810> for

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 
this is more a better solution for

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.870 
this is more a better solution for
at-home<00:05:19.500> use<00:05:19.530> because<00:05:20.130> you<00:05:20.280> can<00:05:20.430> wash<00:05:20.610> it<00:05:20.639> and

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
at-home use because you can wash it and

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:21.589 
at-home use because you can wash it and
reuse<00:05:21.090> it

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:21.599 
reuse it

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:24.260 
reuse it
salons<00:05:22.199> you<00:05:22.470> may<00:05:22.590> not<00:05:22.800> want<00:05:23.099> to<00:05:23.280> have<00:05:23.940> to<00:05:24.060> wash

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
salons you may not want to have to wash

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.529 
salons you may not want to have to wash
them<00:05:24.510> between<00:05:24.810> each<00:05:24.990> use<00:05:25.490> but<00:05:26.490> you<00:05:27.300> know<00:05:27.389> you

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:27.539 
them between each use but you know you

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:30.439 
them between each use but you know you
buy<00:05:27.690> it<00:05:27.770> you<00:05:28.770> use<00:05:28.949> it<00:05:28.979> you<00:05:29.460> reuse<00:05:29.820> it<00:05:30.030> you<00:05:30.060> can

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:30.449 
buy it you use it you reuse it you can

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:32.480 
buy it you use it you reuse it you can
wash<00:05:30.660> it<00:05:30.690> if<00:05:30.960> you<00:05:31.050> get<00:05:31.169> a<00:05:31.229> dirty<00:05:31.500> and<00:05:31.800> you<00:05:32.280> have

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
wash it if you get a dirty and you have

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.529 
wash it if you get a dirty and you have
full<00:05:33.139> movement<00:05:34.139> and<00:05:34.710> flexibility<00:05:35.310> so<00:05:36.060> that's

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:36.539 
full movement and flexibility so that's

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:40.600 
full movement and flexibility so that's
the<00:05:36.720> plus<00:05:36.930> and<00:05:37.229> the<00:05:37.260> other<00:05:37.979> solution<00:05:38.870> that<00:05:39.870> I

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:40.610 
the plus and the other solution that I

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:45.050 
the plus and the other solution that I
prefer<00:05:41.610> is<00:05:41.960> good<00:05:42.960> old<00:05:43.610> look<00:05:44.610> broad-spectrum

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.060 
prefer is good old look broad-spectrum

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.650 
prefer is good old look broad-spectrum
SPF<00:05:45.710> so<00:05:46.710> this<00:05:47.010> is<00:05:47.190> just<00:05:47.400> my<00:05:47.610> daily<00:05:47.880> facial
