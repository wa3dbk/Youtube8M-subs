that glass container for days on end
with<00:01:45.899> lots<00:01:46.079> of<00:01:46.170> people<00:01:46.500> playing<00:01:46.740> it<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:47.159> is

with lots of people playing it it is

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.380 
with lots of people playing it it is
going<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.970> overheat<00:01:48.390> because<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.799> device

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
going to overheat because the device

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.539 
going to overheat because the device
extracts<00:01:51.390> heat<00:01:51.630> out<00:01:51.899> of<00:01:52.409> its<00:01:52.560> back<00:01:52.799> fans<00:01:53.159> out

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
extracts heat out of its back fans out

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.219 
extracts heat out of its back fans out
of<00:01:53.729> his<00:01:53.850> exhaust<00:01:54.299> fans<00:01:54.630> that's<00:01:55.020> what<00:01:55.140> it's

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
of his exhaust fans that's what it's

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.840 
of his exhaust fans that's what it's
supposed<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.500> do<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:56.280> heat<00:01:56.490> is<00:01:56.700> then

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
supposed to do and that heat is then

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.660 
supposed to do and that heat is then
trapped<00:01:57.180> in<00:01:57.360> this<00:01:57.450> glass<00:01:57.659> container<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.670> over

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
trapped in this glass container and over

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.969 
trapped in this glass container and over
time<00:01:59.969> is<00:02:00.270> making<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:01.020> container<00:02:01.409> hotter<00:02:01.770> and

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
time is making that container hotter and

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.310 
time is making that container hotter and
hotter<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.969> console<00:02:03.450> then<00:02:03.659> is<00:02:03.840> gonna<00:02:04.020> be

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
hotter and the console then is gonna be

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.800 
hotter and the console then is gonna be
freakin<00:02:05.189> fried<00:02:05.610> and<00:02:06.030> that's<00:02:06.299> what's<00:02:06.630> gonna

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
freakin fried and that's what's gonna

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.740 
freakin fried and that's what's gonna
happen<00:02:07.049> now<00:02:07.740> I<00:02:08.009> think<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.910> ps4<00:02:09.209> has<00:02:09.569> done

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
happen now I think the ps4 has done

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.240 
happen now I think the ps4 has done
something<00:02:09.959> which<00:02:10.289> obviously<00:02:10.500> I<00:02:10.770> think<00:02:10.950> it

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
something which obviously I think it

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.979 
something which obviously I think it
should<00:02:11.520> do<00:02:11.700> anyway<00:02:11.970> I<00:02:12.060> think<00:02:12.209> a<00:02:12.360> complete

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
should do anyway I think a complete

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.940 
should do anyway I think a complete
Marvel<00:02:13.530> but

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
Marvel but

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.190 
Marvel but
do<00:02:14.069> think<00:02:14.340> it's<00:02:14.489> something<00:02:14.700> that<00:02:14.910> and<00:02:15.330> I'm

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
do think it's something that and I'm

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.400 
do think it's something that and I'm
glad<00:02:16.650> it<00:02:16.830> has<00:02:17.180> number<00:02:18.180> basically<00:02:18.660> from<00:02:19.140> what<00:02:19.379> I

a fail-safe basically and from what I've

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.559 
a fail-safe basically and from what I've
been<00:02:50.010> reading<00:02:50.549> of<00:02:51.030> see<00:02:51.180> I<00:02:51.209> wasn't<00:02:51.390> there

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569

been reading of see I wasn't there
myself<00:02:51.720> and<00:02:52.200> I<00:02:52.260> can<00:02:52.410> only<00:02:52.500> work<00:02:52.799> with<00:02:53.040> the<00:02:53.220> bits

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
myself and I can only work with the bits

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.120 
myself and I can only work with the bits
I've<00:02:53.579> been<00:02:53.760> reading<00:02:54.150> about<00:02:54.239> the<00:02:55.200> cabinet<00:02:56.010> was

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
I've been reading about the cabinet was

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.520 
I've been reading about the cabinet was
opened<00:02:56.640> and<00:02:56.910> within<00:02:57.060> about<00:02:57.209> two<00:02:57.660> seconds<00:02:58.260> the

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
opened and within about two seconds the

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.229 
opened and within about two seconds the
peaceful<00:02:59.040> was<00:02:59.250> back<00:02:59.489> up<00:02:59.670> and<00:02:59.849> running<00:03:00.030> again

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
peaceful was back up and running again

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.839 
peaceful was back up and running again
now<00:03:00.959> I<00:03:00.989> think<00:03:01.079> really<00:03:01.769> this<00:03:02.069> piece<00:03:02.340> of<00:03:02.519> news<00:03:02.819> is

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
now I think really this piece of news is

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:05.809 
now I think really this piece of news is
more<00:03:03.329> good<00:03:03.569> than<00:03:03.630> bad<00:03:03.870> you<00:03:04.500> know<00:03:04.680> if<00:03:05.519> you<00:03:05.700> look

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
more good than bad you know if you look

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.500 
more good than bad you know if you look
at<00:03:05.940> it<00:03:06.030> this<00:03:06.120> way<00:03:06.329> right<00:03:07.640> the<00:03:08.640> heat<00:03:08.880> was<00:03:09.239> quite

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
at it this way right the heat was quite

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.330 
at it this way right the heat was quite
substantial<00:03:09.660> obviously<00:03:10.500> in<00:03:10.620> that<00:03:10.829> and<00:03:11.040> it<00:03:11.130> did

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
substantial obviously in that and it did

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.309 
substantial obviously in that and it did
get<00:03:11.670> hot<00:03:11.880> and<00:03:12.180> you<00:03:12.239> know<00:03:12.540> and<00:03:12.720> that's<00:03:13.049> the<00:03:13.230> way

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
get hot and you know and that's the way

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:14.600 
get hot and you know and that's the way
that<00:03:13.349> worked<00:03:13.739> and<00:03:13.980> I<00:03:14.069> think<00:03:14.280> that's<00:03:14.400> sort<00:03:14.519> of

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
that worked and I think that's sort of

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:16.430 
that worked and I think that's sort of
what<00:03:14.819> I<00:03:14.849> would<00:03:15.090> expect<00:03:15.510> to<00:03:15.630> happen<00:03:15.930> to<00:03:16.319> be

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
what I would expect to happen to be

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.930 
what I would expect to happen to be
honest<00:03:16.709> and<00:03:16.860> you<00:03:17.280> know<00:03:17.370> I<00:03:17.400> don't<00:03:17.670> think<00:03:17.790> I'm

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
honest and you know I don't think I'm

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.759 
honest and you know I don't think I'm
letting<00:03:18.090> Sony<00:03:18.600> off<00:03:18.720> for<00:03:18.959> this<00:03:19.049> I<00:03:19.200> think<00:03:19.500> was

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
letting Sony off for this I think was

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.559 
letting Sony off for this I think was
absolutely<00:03:19.920> stupid<00:03:20.730> that<00:03:21.090> they<00:03:21.120> put<00:03:21.389> it<00:03:21.480> in

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.569 
absolutely stupid that they put it in

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:23.360 
absolutely stupid that they put it in
that<00:03:21.690> glass<00:03:21.930> container<00:03:22.440> because<00:03:23.100> what<00:03:23.220> you

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
that glass container because what you

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.069 
that glass container because what you
expect<00:03:23.760> to<00:03:23.940> happen<00:03:24.150> you<00:03:24.569> know<00:03:24.690> I<00:03:24.720> think<00:03:24.989> they

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
expect to happen you know I think they

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:26.240 
expect to happen you know I think they
should<00:03:25.200> have<00:03:25.230> put<00:03:25.440> it<00:03:25.530> in<00:03:25.560> somewhere<00:03:25.980> that<00:03:26.160> was

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
should have put it in somewhere that was

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.670 
should have put it in somewhere that was
well<00:03:26.430> ventilated<00:03:27.060> you<00:03:27.630> know<00:03:27.750> maybe<00:03:27.930> the<00:03:28.470> glass

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
well ventilated you know maybe the glass

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.289 
well ventilated you know maybe the glass
container<00:03:28.829> but<00:03:29.160> I<00:03:29.190> have<00:03:29.340> lots<00:03:29.519> of<00:03:29.700> holes<00:03:30.000> all

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
container but I have lots of holes all

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.930 
container but I have lots of holes all
in<00:03:30.450> I<00:03:30.540> mean<00:03:30.720> like<00:03:30.900> holes<00:03:31.650> or<00:03:32.069> maybe<00:03:32.340> had<00:03:32.730> some

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
in I mean like holes or maybe had some

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.150 
in I mean like holes or maybe had some
fans<00:03:33.269> blowing<00:03:33.660> air<00:03:33.930> onto<00:03:34.319> it<00:03:34.440> I<00:03:34.620> don't<00:03:35.069> know

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
fans blowing air onto it I don't know

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.610 
fans blowing air onto it I don't know
something<00:03:35.750> helping<00:03:36.750> to<00:03:36.900> keep<00:03:37.079> it<00:03:37.230> cool<00:03:37.410> at

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
something helping to keep it cool at

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.289 
something helping to keep it cool at
least<00:03:37.680> it<00:03:37.980> was<00:03:38.069> stupid<00:03:38.310> the<00:03:38.519> way<00:03:38.639> they<00:03:38.819> kept<00:03:39.090> it

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
least it was stupid the way they kept it

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:41.270 
least it was stupid the way they kept it
and<00:03:40.019> that's<00:03:40.230> what<00:03:40.470> sort<00:03:40.560> of<00:03:40.650> thing<00:03:40.829> was<00:03:40.980> that

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
and that's what sort of thing was that

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.550 
and that's what sort of thing was that
was<00:03:41.370> bound<00:03:41.760> to<00:03:42.090> happen<00:03:42.150> but<00:03:43.079> what<00:03:43.319> actually

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
was bound to happen but what actually

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.470 
was bound to happen but what actually
there's<00:03:44.160> two<00:03:44.220> things<00:03:44.639> from<00:03:44.880> this<00:03:45.180> that<00:03:45.359> I<00:03:45.420> am

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
there's two things from this that I am

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.390 
there's two things from this that I am
actually<00:03:45.660> quite<00:03:45.900> happy<00:03:46.319> about<00:03:46.350> the<00:03:47.130> first

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
actually quite happy about the first

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.759 
actually quite happy about the first
thing<00:03:47.730> is<00:03:47.940> that<00:03:48.359> the<00:03:48.420> ps4<00:03:48.690> was<00:03:49.380> smart<00:03:49.680> enough

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
thing is that the ps4 was smart enough

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.009 
thing is that the ps4 was smart enough
to<00:03:50.340> actually<00:03:50.489> tell<00:03:51.150> the<00:03:51.329> user<00:03:51.540> you<00:03:51.780> know<00:03:51.870> which

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
to actually tell the user you know which

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.259 
to actually tell the user you know which
previous<00:03:52.500> gen<00:03:52.709> didn't<00:03:53.010> do<00:03:53.190> this<00:03:53.400> to<00:03:53.910> tell<00:03:54.120> the

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
previous gen didn't do this to tell the

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:54.620 
previous gen didn't do this to tell the
user

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
user

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.809 
user
apart<00:03:55.260> from<00:03:55.500> maybe<00:03:55.769> some<00:03:55.889> of<00:03:56.040> the<00:03:56.100> newer<00:03:56.280> Xbox

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
apart from maybe some of the newer Xbox

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:00.050 
apart from maybe some of the newer Xbox
as<00:03:56.970> I<00:03:57.060> know<00:03:57.120> they<00:03:57.329> did<00:03:57.540> that<00:03:57.569> as<00:03:57.810> well<00:03:58.880> to<00:03:59.880> tell

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
as I know they did that as well to tell

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.729 
as I know they did that as well to tell
you<00:04:00.269> sir<00:04:00.329> that<00:04:00.690> you<00:04:00.840> know<00:04:00.959> hey<00:04:01.170> I'm<00:04:01.349> too<00:04:01.500> hard

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
you sir that you know hey I'm too hard

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.349 
you sir that you know hey I'm too hard
let's<00:04:01.920> sort<00:04:02.099> this<00:04:02.190> out<00:04:02.340> and<00:04:02.489> then<00:04:02.849> the<00:04:02.970> second

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:03.359 
let's sort this out and then the second

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:06.920 
let's sort this out and then the second
thing<00:04:03.569> was<00:04:04.170> that<00:04:04.380> the<00:04:04.500> ps4<00:04:05.420> clearly<00:04:06.420> actually

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
thing was that the ps4 clearly actually

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.680 
thing was that the ps4 clearly actually
has<00:04:07.109> actually<00:04:07.920> really<00:04:08.280> quite<00:04:08.519> decent<00:04:09.209> cooling

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
has actually really quite decent cooling

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.870 
has actually really quite decent cooling
for<00:04:10.019> it<00:04:10.139> to<00:04:10.230> cool<00:04:10.470> itself<00:04:10.799> back<00:04:11.130> to<00:04:11.340> normal

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
for it to cool itself back to normal

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.309 
for it to cool itself back to normal
operating<00:04:12.299> temperatures<00:04:12.810> within<00:04:13.049> a<00:04:13.139> couple

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
operating temperatures within a couple

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:15.650 
operating temperatures within a couple
of<00:04:13.470> seconds<00:04:13.889> I<00:04:14.040> mean<00:04:14.519> if<00:04:14.669> the<00:04:14.910> fans<00:04:15.209> are<00:04:15.480> really

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
of seconds I mean if the fans are really

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.080 
of seconds I mean if the fans are really
that<00:04:15.930> bad<00:04:16.200> in<00:04:16.470> the<00:04:16.560> ps4<00:04:16.859> don't<00:04:17.549> you<00:04:17.639> think<00:04:17.910> that

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
that bad in the ps4 don't you think that

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:19.759 
that bad in the ps4 don't you think that
it<00:04:18.180> would<00:04:18.269> take<00:04:18.450> a<00:04:18.599> lot<00:04:18.720> longer<00:04:18.959> than<00:04:19.169> that<00:04:19.349> for

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:19.769 
it would take a lot longer than that for

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.279 
it would take a lot longer than that for
it<00:04:19.829> to<00:04:19.979> cool<00:04:20.130> itself<00:04:20.780> that's<00:04:21.780> just<00:04:22.019> my<00:04:22.169> opinion

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
it to cool itself that's just my opinion

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:24.200 
it to cool itself that's just my opinion
if<00:04:22.740> the<00:04:22.800> ps4<00:04:23.099> is<00:04:23.340> hot<00:04:23.550> and<00:04:23.760> it's<00:04:23.849> managed<00:04:24.090> to

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
if the ps4 is hot and it's managed to

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.930 
if the ps4 is hot and it's managed to
get<00:04:24.330> it<00:04:24.450> from<00:04:24.659> too<00:04:25.380> hot<00:04:25.620> to<00:04:26.010> operating<00:04:26.520> in

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
get it from too hot to operating in

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:27.680 
get it from too hot to operating in
about<00:04:27.240> a<00:04:27.270> couple<00:04:27.570> of

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
about a couple of

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.750 
about a couple of
second<00:04:28.080> I<00:04:28.260> think<00:04:28.710> the<00:04:28.860> fans<00:04:29.070> are<00:04:29.250> pretty<00:04:29.490> damn

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:29.760 
second I think the fans are pretty damn

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.130 
second I think the fans are pretty damn
good<00:04:30.030> on<00:04:30.210> there<00:04:30.360> and<00:04:30.450> I<00:04:30.540> think<00:04:30.780> to<00:04:30.870> be<00:04:30.960> honest

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
good on there and I think to be honest

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.270 
good on there and I think to be honest
they<00:04:31.230> should<00:04:31.440> be<00:04:31.590> pretty<00:04:31.770> damn<00:04:32.040> good

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
they should be pretty damn good

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.570 
they should be pretty damn good
considering<00:04:33.120> the<00:04:33.270> amount<00:04:33.480> of<00:04:34.070> sort<00:04:35.070> of<00:04:35.280> space

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
considering the amount of sort of space

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.040 
considering the amount of sort of space
it<00:04:35.820> has<00:04:36.000> for<00:04:36.300> them<00:04:36.390> at<00:04:36.480> the<00:04:36.600> back<00:04:36.780> it's

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
it has for them at the back it's

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.390 
it has for them at the back it's
literally<00:04:37.410> the<00:04:37.470> whole<00:04:37.620> back<00:04:37.860> is<00:04:37.890> pretty<00:04:38.280> much

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
literally the whole back is pretty much

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.080 
literally the whole back is pretty much
dedicated<00:04:38.640> to<00:04:39.240> exhausting<00:04:39.780> out<00:04:39.900> air<00:04:40.140> so<00:04:41.090> this

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
dedicated to exhausting out air so this

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.090 
dedicated to exhausting out air so this
is<00:04:42.270> what<00:04:42.570> I<00:04:42.600> feel<00:04:42.990> about<00:04:43.230> it<00:04:43.470> this<00:04:43.620> is<00:04:43.830> what<00:04:44.070> I

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
is what I feel about it this is what I

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.220 
is what I feel about it this is what I
feel<00:04:44.310> is<00:04:44.430> the<00:04:44.550> facts<00:04:44.850> about<00:04:45.090> it<00:04:45.270> and<00:04:45.720> you<00:04:46.080> guys

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:46.230 
feel is the facts about it and you guys

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.080 
feel is the facts about it and you guys
can<00:04:46.290> obviously<00:04:46.710> make<00:04:47.040> your<00:04:47.190> own<00:04:47.310> opinion<00:04:47.460> from

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
can obviously make your own opinion from

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.120 
can obviously make your own opinion from
that<00:04:48.300> but<00:04:48.750> I<00:04:48.780> just<00:04:48.840> really<00:04:49.290> wanted<00:04:49.620> to<00:04:49.770> inform

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
that but I just really wanted to inform

you<00:04:50.250> guys<00:04:50.490> and<00:04:50.940> I<00:04:51.450> think<00:04:51.690> you'd<00:04:51.870> think<00:04:52.140> people

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
you guys and I think you'd think people
