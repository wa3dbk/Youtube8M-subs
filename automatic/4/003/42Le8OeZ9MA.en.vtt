00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.939
 It's personal beauty where I'm going to make a 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.089
 video teaching how it solves 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.859
 four by four using the yao method 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.030
 has not yet subscribed to my channel 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.290
 sign up 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.030
 every time I post a video goes 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.509
 to know first I'll make one 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.070
 Summary here for those who already know how to ride the 44 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.810
 well and just want to get an idea of â€‹â€‹how 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.820
 the real thing works because it actually 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.859
 You already know how to put everything else together. 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.019
 the way teaching for example visa 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.789
 44 hours when I tell you what you can do 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.390
 just gonna change the order a little bit you go 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.830
 understand 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.710
 then're the first thing you will do 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.780
 is to mount two opposing faces in the 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.440
 and when you finish joining the 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.600
 pairs 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.370
 You already have the cross ready and that's it. 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.050
 finish three by three 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.379
 so how are you going to be with the cross? 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.390
 ready who always rides with the same color 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.640
 when assembling the first two 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.379
 opposite phases that have to mount a 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.480
 It has to be the color you are going to use. 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.070
 then mount the thirteen by 3 to 1 then 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.629
 for example always very white I have 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.910
 that make white and yellow here who is 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.530
 collor neutron mounts with any color 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.030
 then the first two centers can 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.250
 catch if it's easier then I'll 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:09.590
 assemble two colors here 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:09.590
 op white and yellow 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.850
 okay after the two rode there you go 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.920
 do you will join the pairs that 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.380
 drugs in my case to form the countries 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.259
 with white ac I have a blue and white 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.630
 and blue and white and see that I can now 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.670
 stirring the centers here does not have 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:34.979
 problem because I only have both 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:37.829
 opposite the orange blue 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.369
 I'll put it right here. 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:45.680
 O 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:48.420
 after which a good example is missing 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.009
 The last one you do not have to put the 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.850
 campaign should put here is the opposite 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.799
 blue 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.479
 I can put him here in the 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.250
 wrong place because you will see that 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.899
 then it will make it easier to put 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.180
 the last one that will be left here is 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.979
 missing one is also good 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.329
 done that maintain two opposite phases 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.540
 three godfathers 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:08.039
 now I'm going to set up a center of it 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.009
 The way you were not the other way 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.610
 only here you can only use this part to 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.640
 because they do not have a parent yet 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.860
 in other six did not end here fixed by 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.980
 example make a kiss here 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.990
 maybe in a month here this came 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.060
 ask there I have to turn here 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:29.410
 using this part that has no varzim 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:31.890
 also I bring here and again brought to 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:35.560
 get out there in your green 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:38.709
 to iacc to orange right? 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:47.970
 come on take it is always this piece to 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:47.970
 here to fix the orange 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:56.620
 This is blue here so I'll have to 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:58.480
 get off here and back 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.100
 I've ridden all the bodies after I've kept 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.130
 all those who will make one last 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.770
 it looks like the red is missing here 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:09.660
 and white or null and white is here it has 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.660
 To use this part here to get down 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.720
 put green wrong because you do 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:20.799
 places the red and white in place of 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:23.440
 green turn down and come back green now 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:26.470
 it's so right to line up with the blue 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.989
 green orange and red may come back 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.890
 here if you want but do not need at the ready 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:31.510
 I made the cross 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.640
 We will not cross no more mess 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.019
 It was good to join the other couples now. 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.030
 I usually try to see if I can 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:39.340
 see already to form some bar 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:43.150
 size this time here but let's go 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:45.630
 this yellow green here with the others 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.630
 videos right 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:57.580
 together with the little one that the other 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.549
 I can form yellow orange play over there 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:03.370
 top of the goal 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:06.010
 I can do this I go back every 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.500
 centers after I graduated two pairs 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.720
 and I leave these two countries behind 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.690
 Game yellow and green back 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.310
 yellow orange back and now only has 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.410
 that form the other pairs of the same 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.220
 The way we used to do before the other 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.810
 way 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:25.700
 O orange and green throw up and then 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:29.270
 How are you coming back here? I 'll be back. 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:31.160
 For only orange and green I put this 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:34.340
 red and blue in place for when 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.920
 return to form yellow and blue 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:39.470
 yellow and blue boot here to gather and 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:44.990
 have to look for green red green 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:48.350
 and red tac boot it there back 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:53.030
 Oops, I'm back, it's only two now. 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:56.020
 quality is not beauty boot here does the 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.020
 parity algorithm 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.700
 see that the cross is still below 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:03.500
 I joined all the neighborhoods the time points 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:05.450
 now three by three and the cross is already 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:23.470
 There you go and do that workout. 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:23.470
 normal falls match the same thing 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:37.330
 look is skin is beauty
