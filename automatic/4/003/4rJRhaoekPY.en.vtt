00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.800
 there was a beautiful match the court asked our 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.400
 fans 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.780
 we saw again 

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.769
 all teams are teams that 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:11.219
 pleasing sure sure 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.199
 He therefore I think that battle beautiful car 

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:15.739
 because there were complaints in court 

00:00:15.739 --> 00:00:16.769
 play time 

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:19.269
 we wanted to win 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:21.230
 name always went out and never 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.429
 if you lose from here 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:25.349
 Today we played with CSKA and linked it with 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:26.130
 locomotive 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.029
 by the way dynamo 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:31.419
 all the same malikov shants 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:33.440
 winners in every game we try 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.440
 to win 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.210
 2 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.810
 we can say that two people because 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.810
 just good luck but after 10 minutes 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.910
 offices that our legend 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.240
 and he had to go out just bind 90 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.650
 if played 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.750
 together and 94 year 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.710
 and lived with him the same room 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.300
 if a woman 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.300
 such a match was impossible 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.410
 thousand only 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.650
 it's ok because you are now 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.620
 team played 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.600
 Now questions tomorrow the game will be again 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.420
 again full stadium people can't walk 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:17.200
 through 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.500
 every day every day on football 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.630
 own money 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.590
 we are pleased and most importantly understand 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.050
 appeared on tv 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.250
 a lot of messages and calls and people 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.450
 thank you for a nice beautiful game 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.200
 what may have been long ago 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.920
 so even fun message egor titus 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.160
 sent no 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.110
 what are you after 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.590
 I can literally say that he 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.189
 after this game does not want to look at 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.210
 championship that is all the same fans 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.960
 Spartak remembers how we played today 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:45.810
 were 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.470
 but the fact that the whole game was Yakutsk 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:48.880
 certain football 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.250
 which recalled he could be somewhere 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.460
 brought nostalgia for those years when we 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.460
 were playing 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.100
 Oleg Chagrin Sandhurst 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.150
 asked us to play cut rubles 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.059
 he play well and that is bad 

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:10.789
 there were no concessions 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.199
 but everyone understands what is 

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:13.839
 Spartak CSKA 

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:15.059
 we understand 

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:16.709
 from our first team doesn't understand 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.559
 this is why 

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:20.209
 we wanted 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:21.479
 we won 

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:23.170
 project accounting teams 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.120
 this player is worth touching opera 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.130
 Economists I think that on what he sharp 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.259
 it can be shown because 

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:32.019
 let people see there as before 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:33.849
 played football in some places 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:35.870
 because physically we are not ready a 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.009
 show everything 90 minutes this game 

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:40.569
 he is in some places or some 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:41.929
 a certain combination can 

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:43.439
 show i think that 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:45.819
 her in children's school how to play 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:47.489
 why for some reason kabaka Rothko bench 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:48.849
 Spartacus someone refused to participate 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:51.219
 from cisco everything was not because pascal 

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:51.900
 niki went 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.420
 maybe all this and good because we 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.240
 came out as a team we had 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.449
 13 14 people and knew that 

00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:01.679
 for we need the fans themselves and us 

00:03:01.679 --> 00:03:03.799
 nowhere to retreat those who took to the field plus 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:06.320
 two people who could do 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.789
 on what you did 

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:10.989
 recently in august dmitry alenichev there 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.789
 Sergey Yuran, please 

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:15.519
 he played a team tomorrow 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.449
 the third time was the team and came 

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:18.699
 played that is 

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:20.299
 Dmitri Alenichev was able to play through 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:21.549
 two days on the street 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:23.269
 for certain reasons probably not 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.469
 I could leave the team all the same person 

00:03:25.469 --> 00:03:27.709
 fighting for first league 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:29.900
 that's why yes we have missed 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.319
 three four people 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:33.189
 why opposite the second rank is clear 

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:34.719
 that this is a very serious problem but 

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:37.189
 all the same why exactly admirers in 

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:38.839
 September this match to hold and 

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:41.609
 planned because almost everything 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:42.879
 these events 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:45.680
 it was definitely September days 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:46.549
 when 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:48.249
 wanted to remind people that such 

00:03:48.249 --> 00:03:51.479
 the problem is it exists and I am nowhere 

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:52.299
 don't get away 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:53.969
 just like me and my 

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:56.930
 they are Spartak and CSKA we are united 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.319
 wanted to show people that this problem is 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:00.849
 she didn't go anywhere 

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:02.919
 so that people remember and those people who 

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:05.039
 who have suffered some 

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:07.389
 loss in which suffered 

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:10.739
 attract a little people's attention 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:12.259
 when you held a farewell match 

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:13.949
 officially against the wings of glory 

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:15.369
 asked whether such an unofficial 

00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:17.150
 beautiful match it 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.019
 he is 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.169
 in the farewell match of the Caucasian line 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:23.529
 and this match is a gift for you 

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:25.960

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:26.710

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:27.659
 that's what happened 

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:29.029

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:30.210

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.279
 three years which they supported me 

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:34.789
 on us veterans where tyrants are 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:35.800
 bad word 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:38.319
 look 90 years because 

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:41.400
 again gave battle to the fans and 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.080
 that attitude to us 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.789
 positive posted on the podium 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:48.379
 those who came who could come I am not saying that 

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:50.680
 it came a little bit those who could come 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.900
 they supported us and thanked for 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:53.699
 the game 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:56.069
 and we tried on our game 

00:04:56.069 --> 00:04:59.069
 thank fans 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:04.360
 but you know when we and 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.080
 90 yen 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.350
 entered every game 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:08.800
 Louis wanted to score 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.370
 I hope they didn't score 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.059
 so when we returned today 90 

00:05:13.059 --> 00:05:15.439
 I just scored 

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:16.930
 I wanted to score a goal 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.839
 because the younger son is the knot 

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:21.769
 eldest son ranked by profit please 

00:05:21.769 --> 00:05:23.529
 CSKA clogged 

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:24.550
 will turn out 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.089
 it will not work 

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:28.199
 in Academy 

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:31.020
 Spartacus 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.020
 yes my son look like 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.169
 You know, and Egor Titov also wanted to invite 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:45.169
 Robson in men is big 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.289
 Yes, I could invite us here too. 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:49.749
 football players 

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:52.120
 which awards are 90 percent 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.020
 this physical form is not ready for it 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.659
 I invited those who 

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:59.659
 well let's say even 13 people we had 

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:03.809
 here come out and fight and there are 90 minutes 

00:06:03.809 --> 00:06:04.509
 games 

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:06.610
 why invite those who can come out 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:07.879
 for 5 10 minutes 

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:10.889
 because it is Spartak CSKA 

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:12.289
 then you understand it 

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:14.990
 but our first team does not understand 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:17.180
 Conversely Mkada farewell mach Lebanon 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:18.960

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.139
 aging completely bye 

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:24.919

 n remember how many in the 90s we call 

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:29.619
 gold medals 

00:06:29.619 --> 00:06:32.439
 and then you will understand 

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:35.469
 it sits us inside Spartak councils due 

00:06:35.469 --> 00:06:37.499
