00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.100

 quantum exactly from roberto gómez 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:48.100
 bolaños had been suffering from some 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.650
 health problems and I already had some 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.870
 time removed from the artistic medium of 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:54.400
 fact he lived in Cancun just because 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.229
 the height of the Mexican headquarters no longer 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.320
 it felt well savior had retired 

00:00:56.229 --> 00:01:00.879
 to that place, the reality is that it was 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.460
 a man always very active always 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:05.740
 he was talking and saying what 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.440

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:15.490
 era on television and in general 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.710
 He expressed how Mexico was and many people 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.780
 locate many of the things he 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.360
 mentioned in his programs as part 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:26.020
 of our idiosyncrasies, that's the way

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:33.189
 boasting this white humor without falling 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:35.259
 in any kind of excess taking care 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:37.720
 very much his own values ​​that were 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:40.090
 those he transmitted to his work and well there 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.369
 very very few things that can be 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.049
 add to a career that is 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:45.909

 made these two key programs between 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.740
 many others that good took it to the 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:02.409
