there<00:02:02.000> are<00:02:02.179> actually<00:02:02.810> four<00:02:03.140> attributes<00:02:03.380> that

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
there are actually four attributes that

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.440 
there are actually four attributes that
we<00:02:03.830> like<00:02:03.979> to<00:02:04.069> talk<00:02:04.190> about<00:02:04.490> it's<00:02:04.849> more<00:02:05.060> durable

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
we like to talk about it's more durable

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.210 
we like to talk about it's more durable
than<00:02:05.660> the<00:02:05.720> alternatives<00:02:06.500> out<00:02:06.560> there<00:02:06.619> it's

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
than the alternatives out there it's

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.650 
than the alternatives out there it's
actually<00:02:07.490> six<00:02:07.700> times<00:02:07.910> more<00:02:08.030> durable<00:02:08.420> than

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
actually six times more durable than

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:09.969 
actually six times more durable than
cotton<00:02:08.840> scientists<00:02:09.470> have<00:02:09.560> proved<00:02:09.830> that

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
cotton scientists have proved that

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.010 
cotton scientists have proved that
essentially<00:02:10.369> they<00:02:10.490> took<00:02:10.610> a<00:02:10.670> fiber<00:02:11.120> of<00:02:11.390> cotton

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
essentially they took a fiber of cotton

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.050 
essentially they took a fiber of cotton
versus<00:02:12.470> wool<00:02:12.680> and<00:02:12.920> basically<00:02:13.190> just<00:02:13.430> bent<00:02:13.940> it

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
versus wool and basically just bent it

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.580 
versus wool and basically just bent it
back<00:02:14.090> and<00:02:14.450> forth<00:02:14.660> and<00:02:14.870> like<00:02:15.140> the<00:02:15.260> nano<00:02:15.440> scale

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
back and forth and like the nano scale

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.740 
back and forth and like the nano scale
its<00:02:16.220> odor<00:02:16.430> resistant<00:02:16.880> wrinkle<00:02:17.090> resistant<00:02:17.630> and

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
its odor resistant wrinkle resistant and

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.480 
its odor resistant wrinkle resistant and
more<00:02:17.990> breathable<00:02:18.500> there's<00:02:18.740> two<00:02:19.040> types<00:02:19.340> of

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
more breathable there's two types of

more breathable there's two types of
wool<00:02:19.700> shirts<00:02:19.940> out<00:02:20.120> there<00:02:20.330> there's<00:02:20.870> the

that's I couldn't give you exact numbers
on<00:02:26.030> that<00:02:26.120> but<00:02:26.180> I<00:02:26.300> would<00:02:26.420> say<00:02:26.510> that's<00:02:26.660> like<00:02:26.810> 85%

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
on that but I would say that's like 85%

with the first Kickstarter campaign it
was<00:02:59.730> just<00:02:59.879> kind<00:03:00.030> of<00:03:00.090> a<00:03:00.540> proof<00:03:00.900> of<00:03:01.019> concept<00:03:01.170> we

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
was just kind of a proof of concept we

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.410 
was just kind of a proof of concept we
had<00:03:02.010> some<00:03:02.220> sample<00:03:02.640> fabrics<00:03:03.090> that<00:03:03.150> we<00:03:03.360> were

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
had some sample fabrics that we were

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.000 
had some sample fabrics that we were
testing<00:03:03.810> and<00:03:04.049> so<00:03:04.349> we<00:03:04.410> wanted<00:03:04.590> to<00:03:04.680> go<00:03:04.769> out<00:03:04.890> to

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
testing and so we wanted to go out to

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.650 
testing and so we wanted to go out to
the<00:03:05.129> consumers<00:03:05.640> basically<00:03:05.849> say<00:03:06.120> this<00:03:06.420> is<00:03:06.569> the

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 
the consumers basically say this is the
