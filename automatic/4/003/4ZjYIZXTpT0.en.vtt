the G Major scale write it out g a b c d
e<00:01:04.240> f<00:01:05.230> sharp<00:01:06.100> and<00:01:06.490> G<00:01:07.560> start<00:01:08.560> on<00:01:08.740> the<00:01:08.980> G<00:01:09.190> note

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
e f sharp and G start on the G note

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.320 
e f sharp and G start on the G note
circle<00:01:10.210> bat<00:01:10.330> G<00:01:10.510> note<00:01:10.740> skip<00:01:11.740> one<00:01:12.310> note<00:01:12.610> so<00:01:13.030> skip

a circle be skip another note and circle

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.820 
a circle be skip another note and circle
go<00:01:18.970> to<00:01:19.030> the<00:01:19.119> next<00:01:19.270> one<00:01:19.479> and<00:01:19.510> circle<00:01:19.960> d<00:01:20.170> so<00:01:20.770> you

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
go to the next one and circle d so you

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.210 
go to the next one and circle d so you
have<00:01:20.979> a<00:01:21.010> G's<00:01:21.310> B's<00:01:21.820> and<00:01:22.090> DS<00:01:22.830> so<00:01:23.830> we<00:01:23.920> start<00:01:24.160> an

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
have a G's B's and DS so we start an

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.120 
have a G's B's and DS so we start an
orgy<00:01:24.369> a<00:01:25.270> third<00:01:25.990> what<00:01:26.290> we<00:01:26.350> call<00:01:26.500> a<00:01:26.530> third<00:01:26.830> away

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
orgy a third what we call a third away

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.390 
orgy a third what we call a third away
from<00:01:27.430> that<00:01:27.670> would<00:01:28.420> be<00:01:28.540> your<00:01:28.660> be<00:01:29.250> that's<00:01:30.250> why<00:01:30.369> I

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 
from that would be your be that's why I

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.120 
from that would be your be that's why I
skipped<00:01:30.790> one<00:01:30.970> note<00:01:31.240> in<00:01:31.479> the<00:01:31.840> scale<00:01:32.110> and<00:01:32.710> then

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
skipped one note in the scale and then

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.030 
skipped one note in the scale and then
if<00:01:33.250> you<00:01:33.310> start<00:01:33.550> on<00:01:33.610> your<00:01:33.640> beat<00:01:33.940> a<00:01:34.860> third<00:01:35.860> away

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 
if you start on your beat a third away

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.469 
if you start on your beat a third away
from<00:01:36.250> that<00:01:36.720> it's<00:01:37.720> going<00:01:37.900> to<00:01:37.990> be<00:01:38.140> a<00:01:38.170> deep<00:01:39.479> and

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
from that it's going to be a deep and

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:42.390 
from that it's going to be a deep and
that's<00:01:40.900> the<00:01:41.110> way<00:01:41.229> you<00:01:41.290> build<00:01:41.530> chords<00:01:41.890> now<00:01:42.250> when

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
that's the way you build chords now when

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.550 
that's the way you build chords now when
you're<00:01:42.490> talking<00:01:42.759> about<00:01:42.970> a<00:01:43.150> major<00:01:43.390> chord<00:01:43.810> I'm

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
you're talking about a major chord I'm

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.650 
you're talking about a major chord I'm
going<00:01:44.710> to<00:01:44.770> have<00:01:44.860> what<00:01:45.009> we<00:01:45.100> call<00:01:45.310> a<00:01:45.490> major<00:01:46.180> 3rd

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:46.660 
going to have what we call a major 3rd

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.800 
going to have what we call a major 3rd
on<00:01:46.930> the<00:01:46.990> bottom<00:01:47.200> or<00:01:47.770> from<00:01:48.220> the<00:01:48.610> root<00:01:48.850> note<00:01:49.090> to

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
on the bottom or from the root note to

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.260 
on the bottom or from the root note to
the<00:01:49.930> third<00:01:50.200> of<00:01:50.380> the<00:01:50.470> chord<00:01:51.240> from<00:01:52.240> your<00:01:52.420> g<00:01:54.270> to

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
the third of the chord from your g to

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.950 
the third of the chord from your g to
your<00:01:55.420> be<00:01:57.060> mm-hmm<00:01:58.060> it's<00:01:58.300> going<00:01:58.420> to<00:01:58.450> be<00:01:58.600> a<00:01:58.630> major

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
your be mm-hmm it's going to be a major

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.320 
your be mm-hmm it's going to be a major
third<00:01:59.290> what<00:01:59.530> we<00:01:59.590> call<00:01:59.740> a<00:01:59.770> major<00:01:59.979> third<00:02:00.310> if<00:02:01.150> it

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
third what we call a major third if it

Abby mm and then from the 3rd to the 5th
what<00:02:15.700> we<00:02:15.790> call<00:02:15.940> the<00:02:16.030> fifth<00:02:16.299> of<00:02:16.450> the<00:02:16.570> chord<00:02:16.810> the

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
what we call the fifth of the chord the

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:22.530 
what we call the fifth of the chord the
third<00:02:17.200> note<00:02:17.459> custom<00:02:18.459> Abby<00:02:19.049> to<00:02:20.049> addy<00:02:21.330> mmm<00:02:22.330> and

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
third note custom Abby to addy mmm and

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:28.820 
third note custom Abby to addy mmm and
from<00:02:22.959> Abby<00:02:23.260> to<00:02:23.530> addy<00:02:24.660> hmm<00:02:25.660> is<00:02:25.930> a<00:02:26.019> minor<00:02:26.590> third

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
from Abby to addy hmm is a minor third

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.830 
from Abby to addy hmm is a minor third
mm-hmm<00:02:29.830> so<00:02:30.280> that's<00:02:30.489> the<00:02:30.670> formula<00:02:31.000> for<00:02:31.450> any

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
mm-hmm so that's the formula for any

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.420 
mm-hmm so that's the formula for any
major<00:02:32.140> chord<00:02:32.769> that<00:02:32.890> you're<00:02:33.010> talking<00:02:33.100> about

you're going to have a major third from

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:39.870 
you're going to have a major third from
the<00:02:35.950> first<00:02:36.489> to<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:36.940> third

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.360 

and<00:02:40.880> a<00:02:40.970> minor<00:02:41.270> third<00:02:41.600> on<00:02:41.870> top<00:02:42.260> from<00:02:42.680> the<00:02:42.860> 3rd<00:02:43.130> to

and a minor third on top from the 3rd to
the<00:02:43.520> 5th<00:02:46.150> that<00:02:47.150> gives<00:02:47.420> us<00:02:47.600> the<00:02:47.900> characteristic

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
the 5th that gives us the characteristic

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.620 
the 5th that gives us the characteristic
sound<00:02:48.890> of<00:02:49.190> a<00:02:49.370> regular<00:02:49.730> major<00:02:49.970> chord<00:02:52.480> so<00:02:53.480> if<00:02:53.540> you
