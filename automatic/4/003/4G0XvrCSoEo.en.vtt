00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
and kind of like the value that you get

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.110 
and kind of like the value that you get
I<00:02:58.200> think<00:02:58.470> that<00:02:58.709> this<00:02:58.920> is<00:02:59.100> a<00:02:59.280> very<00:02:59.670> good<00:02:59.820> press

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
I think that this is a very good press

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.539 
I think that this is a very good press
concerning<00:03:00.570> that<00:03:00.720> this<00:03:00.950> retails<00:03:01.950> for<00:03:02.100> about

00:03:02.539 --> 00:03:02.549 
concerning that this retails for about

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.190 
concerning that this retails for about
$80<00:03:03.420> or<00:03:03.510> something<00:03:03.810> like<00:03:03.930> that

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
$80 or something like that

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.710 
$80 or something like that
but<00:03:04.920> I<00:03:05.310> think<00:03:05.880> that<00:03:05.970> this<00:03:06.090> is<00:03:06.239> already<00:03:06.570> you

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
but I think that this is already you

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.090 
but I think that this is already you
know<00:03:06.810> the<00:03:06.959> value<00:03:07.260> of<00:03:07.290> my<00:03:07.470> box<00:03:07.680> and<00:03:07.890> I<00:03:07.950> would

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
know the value of my box and I would

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.320 
know the value of my box and I would
definitely<00:03:08.459> this<00:03:08.820> would<00:03:08.970> definitely<00:03:09.120> be

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
definitely this would definitely be

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:10.640 
definitely this would definitely be
something<00:03:09.420> that<00:03:09.840> I<00:03:09.870> would<00:03:10.019> buy<00:03:10.170> with<00:03:10.320> my<00:03:10.470> own

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
something that I would buy with my own

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.070 
something that I would buy with my own
money<00:03:10.860> so<00:03:11.040> I'm<00:03:11.250> very<00:03:11.489> pleased<00:03:11.940> this<00:03:12.690> looks
