00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.529
 I was dating and I have to work with 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.349

 What I do, I do not want to see it. 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:31.080
 many people instead of them 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:34.440
 start a relationship 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:38.490

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.410
 You let the person like you. 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.559
 that many people do they leave 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.960
 like first they indulge 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.899
 first there then they will know the 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.670
 person and then she gets very 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.679
 very disappointed because when they go 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.440
 to know the person the person is nothing 

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:06.540
 what she thought was beginning to 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.970
 to go wrong go beyond the 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.300
 stages of a relationship that 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.660
 start with a friendship later with 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:19.740
 conquest with knowledge of this 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:21.540
 person and verify all right 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.450
 then the person departs for the 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.240
 relationship that is the 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.100
 finally a wedding engagement and what many 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.110
 people mistake those think so, but I

 Do you know who he is? 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.740

 believe everything the person speaks then 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.210

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.800
 Look, people are committing a 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.020
 great, most people are 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.550
 making a big mistake in the 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.549

 they are enchanted by the charm by 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:32.940
 talk about exposing it then they 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:37.560
 start with a feeling 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:40.200
 then after you get married you 're already 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.870
 relating those already went to bed with 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.870
 This person is really dating, and such. 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:49.769
 then she will take notice of 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:51.000
 certain things that do not please her 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:54.060
 disappointed 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.709
 then these people are putting the 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:01.459
 car in front of the oxen 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:04.920
 they are running over things 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:06.230
 no relationship should start with 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.930
 a feeling 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:12.299
 You may even have a feeling for 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.659
 But you do not go through this. 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:17.670
 feeling because the feeling can be 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:21.390
 deceptive you may like what you 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:23.489
 saw what you looked at and such but you 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.250
 you can still nothing because people pretend 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:27.870
 How did you say that he played with the 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.340
 feeling and was already dating the 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.340
 another already had another 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.459
 that is to say all that he felt for 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:40.019
 he was fake 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:41.099
 but you started by feeling then the 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:44.209
 that's right 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:49.650
 It's okay for you to start a relationship. 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:53.069
 with knowledge and not with feeling 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:56.669
 first you know the person you 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:04:00.260
 information and if these 

00:03:56.669 --> 00:04:01.620
 information is praiseworthy 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:06.419
 honest 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:08.549
 there you your head of the authorization to 

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:10.260

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:25.650
 showing that he is sad that he is 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.900

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:31.050
 you 're angry you have to be angry 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.099
 different in actually pretending that he 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.080
 does not exist 

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:36.680
