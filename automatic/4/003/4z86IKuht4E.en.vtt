at speed here's what the rudiments
sounds<00:00:55.170> like

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:03.400 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.990 

you

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.050 

and<00:01:08.560> here's<00:01:09.560> the<00:01:09.680> same<00:01:09.890> pattern<00:01:10.310> played<00:01:10.850> for

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
and here's the same pattern played for

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:17.480 
and here's the same pattern played for
an<00:01:11.180> entire<00:01:11.510> bar

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.069 

the<00:01:18.490> next<00:01:18.789> step<00:01:18.969> once<00:01:19.390> you<00:01:19.509> have<00:01:19.630> the<00:01:19.780> pattern

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:20.079 
the next step once you have the pattern

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:22.260 
the next step once you have the pattern
flowing<00:01:20.469> is<00:01:20.679> to<00:01:21.159> move<00:01:21.340> the<00:01:21.460> accented<00:01:21.880> note<00:01:22.090> on

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
flowing is to move the accented note on

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.899 
flowing is to move the accented note on
to<00:01:22.420> other<00:01:22.569> drums<00:01:22.899> and<00:01:23.109> cymbals<00:01:23.549> here<00:01:24.549> are<00:01:24.700> four

this example shows how the crash and
bass<00:01:58.020> drum<00:01:58.320> might<00:01:58.560> be<00:01:58.680> used<00:01:58.890> to<00:01:59.009> play<00:01:59.189> the

let's<00:02:06.020> now<00:02:06.229> look<00:02:06.439> at<00:02:06.560> one<00:02:06.710> of<00:02:06.799> the<00:02:06.890> ways<00:02:07.040> the

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
let's now look at one of the ways the

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.230 
let's now look at one of the ways the
six<00:02:07.580> stroke<00:02:07.820> roll<00:02:08.060> can<00:02:08.270> be<00:02:08.360> extended

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.940 

this<00:02:12.240> idea<00:02:12.630> involves<00:02:13.140> adding<00:02:13.350> an<00:02:13.530> additional

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
this idea involves adding an additional

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.650 
this idea involves adding an additional
free<00:02:14.220> notes<00:02:14.490> to<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.850> pattern<00:02:15.060> using<00:02:15.570> the

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
free notes to the pattern using the

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.620 
free notes to the pattern using the

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
sticking right left left by adding these

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.750 
sticking right left left by adding these
extra<00:02:18.990> free<00:02:19.200> notes<00:02:19.440> as<00:02:19.800> shown<00:02:20.310> here<00:02:20.340> at<00:02:20.670> the

extra free notes as shown here at the

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.760 
extra free notes as shown here at the
end<00:02:20.880> of<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.060> bar<00:02:21.270> the<00:02:21.810> six<00:02:22.050> stroke<00:02:22.260> roll<00:02:22.530> turns

into<00:02:22.980> a<00:02:23.070> nine<00:02:23.310> stroke<00:02:23.610> roll<00:02:23.880> and<00:02:24.060> the<00:02:24.480> accents

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
into a nine stroke roll and the accents

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.000 
into a nine stroke roll and the accents
are<00:02:24.930> moved<00:02:25.110> from<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.320> downbeat<00:02:25.740> to<00:02:25.890> the

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
these free notes means that the six

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.580 
these free notes means that the six
