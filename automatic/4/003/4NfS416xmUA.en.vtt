00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.090
 We are not going to contact him as usual at this time with Rodrigo was 

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:06.460
 enough next year competitor rodrigo 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.460

00:00:11.159 --> 00:00:14.839
 in the selection and the work he did was in the morning rodrigo kills 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:17.519
 Good afternoon Merida 8 8 laps 

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:19.470
 in fact, they are all 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.470
 despite good food 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.470
 projection 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.439
 narrow tenant effectively because 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.239
 finished the practice that noon we did not move here because 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:33.780
 as a sensible press conference commented where they finally gave 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.519
 zico players of our selection we could talk at length with it 

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:39.590
 we are going to review 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.700
 For a while, this last important thing, we work despite 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.560
 during the practice and the selection will return at four in the afternoon 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.810
 thinking about this match against argentina costa of what we can 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.190
 record what we've talked about these days i 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.660
 but with our camera that does not allow to move let's see what happened in 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.010
 pepito durán practiced commanded by japan in the physical trainer and 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.620
 also by marcelo bielsa worked differentiated as usual 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.810
 work that we used to see in austria with the forwards on the one hand 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.340
 and the hotel tense to the state working for another sector mark gonzález had yesterday 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.210
 an ankle injury to be totally outgrown ccoo and was 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.510
 practicing in a normal way I was also struck by a strong bandage 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.550
 at the knee of Marcelo Salas compañeros say it's nothing 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:29.410
 this could be on the sidelines of the game with 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.520
 argentina worked some group a group that caught the attention by 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.750
 example with feel front where jiménez was where was suazo 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.880
 where he was also matías fernández mark gonzález some of those who have 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.880
 been working together 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.660
 the false work or played payments and collections valle rodrigo 2000 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.970
 he emphasized preconceived playing looking out on the sidelines and fears the arrival 

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:58.240
 up not if ball plays stopped where Luis Jiménez and Matías Fernández 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.280
 they were the protagonists looking for 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.350
 it's a lot of air play too 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.070
 but it was part of the final work practically in the practice of 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.910
 yesterday thing that was repeated today with a role like you already know preponderant 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.610
 ee harding these are the ones that shows what needs to be done in a 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.459
 court as you see on screen and absolutely divided in at least 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.060
 six other sectors per percent every half of the pitch to do what 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.210
 who thinks marcelo bielsa may be his match against argentina other than not 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:29.450
 The players now know that they do not know excerpts marcelo bielsa because 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.090
 charles companies talk about messi talks to them about riquelme about how 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.090
 face for example to 

00:02:37.929 --> 00:02:40.929
 there is some light some clarity regarding the big doubts 

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:45.629
 efe of the Chilean team the position they are disputing clear photo as the 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:48.069
 goalkeeper and center forward 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:51.049
 so far I think we can understand the practices 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:54.870
 could suppose that the brave claudio to be of the game also by the 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.069
 conversation with his movie star that 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:01.349
 etienne a chance to be the start of the Chilean national team but 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:05.590
 until abu does not imagine that tomorrow when they could do football 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.150
 we will have greater in men 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.170
 which will definitely be the starting team because marcelo bielsa 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.609
 is permanently changing scheme 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:15.139
 and the players with whom he works in a timely manner
