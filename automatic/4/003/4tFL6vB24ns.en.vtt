below took Dolphy's website there's a

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.290 
below took Dolphy's website there's a
written<00:02:09.149> guide<00:02:09.360> there's<00:02:09.780> a<00:02:09.840> map<00:02:10.170> out<00:02:10.410> there

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
written guide there's a map out there

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.060 
written guide there's a map out there
and<00:02:11.390> I'm<00:02:11.660> pretty<00:02:11.960> sure<00:02:12.200> they<00:02:12.350> might<00:02:12.560> update<00:02:12.740> it

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
and I'm pretty sure they might update it

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.430 
and I'm pretty sure they might update it
with<00:02:13.160> more<00:02:13.690> locations<00:02:14.690> but<00:02:15.050> I'm<00:02:15.200> pretty<00:02:15.320> sure

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
with more locations but I'm pretty sure

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.440 
with more locations but I'm pretty sure
they<00:02:15.800> are<00:02:15.980> they<00:02:16.400> already<00:02:16.610> found<00:02:17.000> all<00:02:17.300> the

you come up here and there's going to be

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.810 
you come up here and there's going to be
three<00:02:39.080> little<00:02:39.380> baby<00:02:39.560> Tontons<00:02:40.040> and<00:02:40.280> basically

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
three little baby Tontons and basically

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.240 
three little baby Tontons and basically
you<00:02:41.000> just<00:02:41.030> feed<00:02:41.420> them<00:02:41.600> the<00:02:41.870> lure<00:02:42.110> and<00:02:42.350> mobs

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.180 
you just feed them the lure and mobs
gonna<00:02:43.550> spawn<00:02:43.940> hopefully<00:02:44.690> there<00:02:45.530> is<00:02:45.710> a<00:02:45.740> high

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
gonna spawn hopefully there is a high

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.520 
gonna spawn hopefully there is a high
failure<00:02:46.610> failure<00:02:47.420> rate<00:02:47.900> I<00:02:47.930> believe<00:02:48.380> its

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
failure failure rate I believe its

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:49.960 
failure failure rate I believe its
twenty<00:02:48.890> percent<00:02:49.160> chance<00:02:49.430> that<00:02:49.610> he<00:02:49.820> only

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
twenty percent chance that he only

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.770 
twenty percent chance that he only
spawns<00:02:50.560> so<00:02:51.560> it's<00:02:51.800> it's<00:02:52.340> it's<00:02:52.730> uh<00:02:53.060> it's<00:02:53.510> a
