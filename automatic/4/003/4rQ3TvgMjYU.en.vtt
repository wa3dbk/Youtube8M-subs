00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.790
 hello welcome to a new video of 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.400
 our win for metro channel in which 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.879
 this time we want to show you a 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.880
 cortana functionality now that the 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:20.369
 umía de niní is already quite widespread 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.090
 and many of you will have it 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.609
 you know that along with the link has arrived 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.890
 Cortana for Spanish from Spain and for 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.529
 some other languages but not only 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.650
 we have at hand what is proper 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.289
 assistant but also cortana and we 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.450
 will offer other our functionalities 

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:42.750
 additional to what is proper 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.270
 assistant for example we can have the 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.190
 option not to disturb an option 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.750
 quite useful 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:54.000
 where the main function is that 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.160
 cut to communicate 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.559
 in the help you will administer the 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.730
 calls or short messages and in addition 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:05.940
 it is said that any 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:10.580
 another notification like this will be with 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:15.119
 activate it will appear a symbol as of 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:18.270
 a crescent indicating that it is 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:21.000
 that mode is also activated also what 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.670
 we can see in large with which 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.980
 they fear we know that mode is activated 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.680
 do not bother 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.510
 and good is not only to activate or 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:35.040
 deactivate but we can do other 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:39.140
 configurations within this mode by 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.140
 Of course we can activate it by voice 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.810
 activate do not disturb 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.640
 do not disturb has been activated which is 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:51.170
 quite useful 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.170
 deactivate do not disturb 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.460
 do not disturb has been disabled 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:03.060
 and we can see the different 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:06.090
 configurations within the rules 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.649
 then we can put at what hours we want 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.860
 that automatically activates not 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:15.390
 bother that's pretty pretty useful 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:17.489
 good so for example if we want 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.849
 activate any period or for example 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:22.920
 every night from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.810
 have to worry about why when 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.930
 let's go to sleep 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.120
 and we have it activated or not or 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.530
 we can even activate it 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.630
 when we have a wen event of 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.599
 certain calendars as busy from 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:39.510
 such way that during an event during 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:40.739
 a meeting as the mode on the phone 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.500
 will change so as not to disturb 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:46.110
 automatically and we will not receive nor 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.580
 call or messages and notifications 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:51.780
 it will sound with which they will not bother us 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:56.220
 apart 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.420
 so that to contact us we can 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.880
 edit what contracts are 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.270
 preferred in such a way that if a 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:06.170
 contact is in this list 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:07.910
 you can contact me followed by the assets of 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.710
 this way that for example if someone 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:13.720
 in the second one we want to answer 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.880
 Well, it's as easy as putting it in 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.340
 the list and even if you call us and it's 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.160
 active mode do not disturb that call 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.310
 will be taken will not be rejected 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.950
 by porta na can also be activated 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:29.470
 that anyone I called twice in 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:32.080
 three minutes power at the end of the call 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:35.020
 will continue by which it will be activated again 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.500
 the call with which the telephone rings 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.460
 it's a way also that if we have 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.590
 They want to contact us in a 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:43.660
 urgently, if they do so 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.870
 reiterated we assume it's because of something 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.880
 important with which they can talk to 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.920
 we 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.560
 for the text message we also have 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.600
 a configuration that the contracts 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.810
 Preferred people can hire me 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:01.810
 for example ask them if they want 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.700
 contact me with what they cut to what 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:08.410
 will do before the arrival of a short message 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:10.330
 will send you a message indicating hello 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:13.330
 jose is not available and maybe 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:16.630
 late to respond but if it is urgent send 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:19.270
 a message with the word toc toc and the 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:21.459
 message will be delivered stating that it is 

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:25.300
 an automatic answer from windows 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:27.820
 phone or if we do not want anyone else but 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.970
 You can contact us and still 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.800
 well send the message indicating 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.950
 that for example is not available and 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:39.190
 it may take a while to respond to the east 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:42.639
 good messages because it is configurable or not 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:44.169
 what is the shipping 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:46.479
 the truth that functionality is 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:49.990
 pretty good we see it pretty useful 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:52.360
 because it is quite different from what it is 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:55.240
 the way to say good then active the 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.680
 vibrator or active silence because 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.080
 good as we can see will give us 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.870
 different functionalities possibilities 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:04.300
 of even the phone interacting 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:07.740
 with whoever has them that although we 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.740
 want to contact us
