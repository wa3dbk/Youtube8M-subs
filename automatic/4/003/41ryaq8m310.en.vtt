Hartung<00:00:03.360> and<00:00:04.110> what<00:00:04.560> we<00:00:04.650> have<00:00:04.799> here<00:00:05.190> is<00:00:05.370> a<00:00:05.400> model

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060 
Hartung and what we have here is a model

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.230 
Hartung and what we have here is a model
of<00:00:06.210> a<00:00:06.330> right<00:00:06.629> knee<00:00:07.460> for<00:00:08.460> my<00:00:08.550> students<00:00:08.940> it's

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
of a right knee for my students it's

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.490 
of a right knee for my students it's
good<00:00:09.360> for<00:00:09.540> you<00:00:09.630> this<00:00:09.750> is<00:00:09.870> the<00:00:09.960> only<00:00:10.080> one<00:00:10.200> I<00:00:10.260> have

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
good for you this is the only one I have

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.470 
good for you this is the only one I have
so<00:00:10.889> anything<00:00:11.460> on<00:00:11.550> this<00:00:11.700> model<00:00:12.030> is<00:00:12.090> going<00:00:12.269> to<00:00:12.360> be

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
so anything on this model is going to be

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.140 
so anything on this model is going to be
the<00:00:12.599> right<00:00:12.750> hand<00:00:12.960> side<00:00:13.490> let's<00:00:14.490> look<00:00:14.790> at<00:00:14.940> the

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
the right hand side let's look at the

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.480 
the right hand side let's look at the
things<00:00:15.480> that<00:00:15.570> you<00:00:15.809> need<00:00:16.020> to<00:00:16.199> know<00:00:16.410> you<00:00:17.070> need<00:00:17.310> to

dense regular connective tissue up here

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.779 
dense regular connective tissue up here
it's<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.410> tendon<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:47.100> down<00:00:47.250> here<00:00:47.579> it's<00:00:47.700> a

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
ligament and you need to know for this

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.500 
ligament and you need to know for this
model<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.129> ligament<00:00:50.550> this<00:00:50.789> is<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.059> patellar

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
model the ligament this is the patellar

00:00:51.510 --> 00:01:00.990 
model the ligament this is the patellar
ligament<00:00:55.010> right<00:00:56.010> patellar<00:00:56.579> ligament

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.229 

the<00:01:01.570> medial<00:01:02.140> collateral<00:01:02.440> ligament<00:01:03.250> remember

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
the medial collateral ligament remember

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.660 
the medial collateral ligament remember
that<00:01:04.390> the<00:01:04.510> tibia<00:01:04.930> is<00:01:05.140> medial<00:01:05.680> and<00:01:05.950> the<00:01:05.980> fibula

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
that the tibia is medial and the fibula

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.720 
that the tibia is medial and the fibula
is<00:01:06.940> lateral<00:01:07.800> that<00:01:08.800> should<00:01:09.250> help<00:01:09.370> you<00:01:09.550> figure

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:09.730 
is lateral that should help you figure

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:11.310 
is lateral that should help you figure
out<00:01:09.910> which<00:01:10.210> one<00:01:10.420> is<00:01:10.570> the<00:01:10.600> medial<00:01:11.080> collateral

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
out which one is the medial collateral

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.660 
out which one is the medial collateral
ligament<00:01:12.130> and<00:01:12.390> which<00:01:13.390> one<00:01:13.630> is<00:01:13.840> the<00:01:14.680> lateral

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
ligament and which one is the lateral

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.010 
ligament and which one is the lateral
collateral<00:01:16.060> ligament<00:01:18.480> one<00:01:19.480> more<00:01:19.660> time<00:01:19.840> on

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
collateral ligament one more time on

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.850 
collateral ligament one more time on
that<00:01:20.140> one<00:01:20.200> right<00:01:22.620> medial<00:01:23.620> collateral

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
that one right medial collateral

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.290 
that one right medial collateral
ligament<00:01:26.100> right<00:01:27.100> lateral<00:01:28.030> collateral

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.300 
ligament right lateral collateral

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.710 
ligament right lateral collateral
ligament<00:01:29.110> and<00:01:30.150> then<00:01:31.150> we'll<00:01:31.360> move<00:01:31.510> to<00:01:31.570> the

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
ligament and then we'll move to the

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.780 
ligament and then we'll move to the
inside<00:01:31.840> of<00:01:32.470> the<00:01:32.530> knee<00:01:32.680> if<00:01:32.860> I<00:01:33.930> if<00:01:34.930> I<00:01:35.170> reflect<00:01:35.790> the

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
inside of the knee if I if I reflect the

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.050 
inside of the knee if I if I reflect the
patellar<00:01:37.210> ligament<00:01:38.460> inside<00:01:39.460> here<00:01:39.760> you<00:01:39.910> can

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
patellar ligament inside here you can

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.880 
patellar ligament inside here you can
see<00:01:40.360> the<00:01:40.830> intra<00:01:41.830> cruciate<00:01:42.369> ligament<00:01:43.890> this

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
see the intra cruciate ligament this

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.870 
see the intra cruciate ligament this
would<00:01:45.130> be<00:01:45.840> anterior<00:01:47.369> cruciate<00:01:48.369> ligament<00:01:49.710> and

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
would be anterior cruciate ligament and

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.609 
would be anterior cruciate ligament and
if<00:01:51.880> I<00:01:52.030> flip<00:01:52.270> the<00:01:52.420> model<00:01:52.600> over<00:01:52.840> so<00:01:53.170> we<00:01:53.259> can<00:01:53.410> see

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
if I flip the model over so we can see

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:58.620 
if I flip the model over so we can see
the<00:01:53.740> back<00:01:56.220> this<00:01:57.220> is<00:01:57.280> the<00:01:57.580> posterior<00:01:58.030> cruciate

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
the back this is the posterior cruciate

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:04.420 
the back this is the posterior cruciate
ligament

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.100 

and<00:02:04.790> then<00:02:05.060> the<00:02:05.180> last<00:02:05.360> thing<00:02:05.600> I<00:02:05.720> have<00:02:05.870> in<00:02:05.960> my

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
and then the last thing I have in my

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.999 
and then the last thing I have in my
list<00:02:07.690> is<00:02:08.690> the<00:02:08.899> meniscus<00:02:09.320> and<00:02:09.590> I<00:02:09.649> can<00:02:09.830> leave

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
list is the meniscus and I can leave

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.310 
list is the meniscus and I can leave
this<00:02:10.250> up<00:02:10.430> here<00:02:10.490> for<00:02:10.790> this<00:02:11.050> remember<00:02:12.050> this<00:02:12.140> is

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
this up here for this remember this is

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.720 
this up here for this remember this is
the<00:02:12.440> medial<00:02:12.740> side<00:02:12.950> because<00:02:13.310> it's<00:02:13.460> the<00:02:13.550> side

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
the medial side because it's the side

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.670 
the medial side because it's the side
the<00:02:13.880> tibia<00:02:14.180> is<00:02:14.240> on<00:02:14.390> so<00:02:14.720> that's<00:02:14.870> the<00:02:15.200> medial

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
the tibia is on so that's the medial

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.800 
the tibia is on so that's the medial
meniscus<00:02:15.920> right<00:02:16.490> here<00:02:17.380> medial<00:02:18.380> meniscus<00:02:19.810> over

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
meniscus right here medial meniscus over

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:28.300 
meniscus right here medial meniscus over
here<00:02:21.230> is<00:02:21.380> the<00:02:22.310> lateral<00:02:22.700> meniscus

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.160 

I<00:02:28.370> think<00:02:29.180> that<00:02:29.360> concludes<00:02:29.810> all<00:02:29.989> of<00:02:30.080> the

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
I think that concludes all of the

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.630 
I think that concludes all of the
features<00:02:30.500> you<00:02:30.680> need<00:02:30.709> to<00:02:30.980> know<00:02:31.130> for<00:02:31.370> the<00:02:31.489> knee

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
features you need to know for the knee

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.059 
features you need to know for the knee
joint<00:02:31.940> as<00:02:32.180> always<00:02:33.170> if<00:02:33.349> there's<00:02:33.440> any<00:02:33.620> questions

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 
joint as always if there's any questions

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:36.160 
joint as always if there's any questions
