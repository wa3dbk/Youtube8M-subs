00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500
This is Duke University.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.840
[Organ Music]

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:22.800
When you have a very large space–like
the Chapel–you need enough sound to fill it.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.800
[Organ Music]

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.940
The Benjamin Newton Duke Memorial Oregon has four manuals and peddle

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:37.120
67 speaking stops and 5,030 pipes.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.340
Each manual or division and pedal has a different character.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.940
It has different types of
sounds. We have the second manual which has

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.540
some of the louder and more full sounds.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.740
[Organ Music]

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:56.140
And then the Boven Varick, the third manual, we have some other more characteristic sounds of Dutch or

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.200
North German instrument from the 18th century.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.520
Bar pipe

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.880
With this we have flute stops which are a sweeter sound

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.880
[Organ Music]

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.180
We also have reed stops that have an
extra reed tongue.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.180
[Organ Music]

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.060
And we different kinds of trumpets.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.060
[Organ Music]

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:34.520
So here the pedal board is flat across
and so we can put on some stops

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.520
[Organ Music]

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.360
You can couple the manuals together and
not just have to use them independently.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.900
For example, if I wanted this sound here

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.420
[Organ Music]

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.700
But I really wanted to make it a little fuller with more principle sounds from here I could do this

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:01.240
and then I could couple so when I play this manual I'm also getting this one here you can see

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.079
it mechanically couples them together.

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:07.079
[Organ Music]

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.700
This is a mechanical action instrument,
also known as a tracker, so let's take a look inside.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.220
So I play a note, and a sticker
transfers the action down

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.960
and then there is a square that transfers the action 90 degrees

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:31.240
and there's a tracker attached to a roller arm, the roller transfers the action laterally, and then another arm

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:37.520
transfers the action back to the chest
where there's another square which pulls

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.050
on a pallet pulled out wire which pulls
down the pallet and allows pressurized

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:47.030
air to go into a key channel. When a stop
is pulled, the slider moves and it allows

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.100
air to go from the key channel to the
pipe and the pipe speaks

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.280
Each section of pipes corresponds with a different manual or the pedals.

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:02.420
And this note, the second C sharp, is actually this pipe right here.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.520
This is a reed pipe and it's got a resonator

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:12.100
kind of like a trumpet, and it
has an actual reed

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.400
I need to pull this tuning wire off

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.220
Underneath it is the shallot
(not a shallot that's in the onion family)

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.060
It's made very much like a clarinet
mouthpiece if you think about how that's made

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:30.340
And so between the vibrating length
of the reed tongue and the length of the

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.640
resonator that's how the pitch is
determined. Now I've taken off the tuning wire

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:41.800
so this has to go back in and now
this pipe is completely out of tune

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:48.520
So, to tune this pipe I've turned on another
stop that I know is in tune

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.720
I will play this note and I will tune it against the one pipe that I know is in tune

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.860
and you'll hear beats and the beats will get slower and slower until the note is in tune

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:13.160
[Organ sound]

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:18.020
So now it's in tune. And after that we
have more than a thousand reed pipes and

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.350
more than a thousand flute pipes and
over 2,000 principal pipes and then the

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.260
whole organ will be in tune.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:37.100
For this work I get to do a lot of climbing. There are ladders in the back and I get to go way up 35 to 40 feet or so and I get to see

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:42.030
things that most people don't because I
get a nice view down the nave as well as

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.620
being able to see some of the stained
glass windows in the Narthex.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.300
If I've done my tuning well enough you should hear nothing out of tune.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:54.560
The repairs I make should look just like the organ looked when it left the factory floor so

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.200
if I'm doing my job really well, you
won't even know I'm here.

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:26.220
