coated so they're not going to get a
whole<00:02:50.670> lot<00:02:50.700> of<00:02:50.910> flavor<00:02:51.239> there<00:02:51.569> but<00:02:52.319> still<00:02:52.650> it's

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
whole lot of flavor there but still it's

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.880 
whole lot of flavor there but still it's
a<00:02:53.220> very<00:02:53.489> good<00:02:53.580> tortilla<00:02:54.000> chip<00:02:54.450> I<00:02:54.720> would<00:02:55.709> give

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
a very good tortilla chip I would give

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.920 
a very good tortilla chip I would give
this<00:02:55.920> a<00:02:56.220> 4<00:02:56.430> out<00:02:56.580> of<00:02:56.640> 5<00:02:56.880> it's<00:02:57.180> it's<00:02:57.510> a<00:02:57.660> very<00:02:57.870> good

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
this a 4 out of 5 it's it's a very good

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.630 
this a 4 out of 5 it's it's a very good
ship<00:02:58.290> and<00:02:58.500> I<00:02:58.560> certainly<00:02:58.920> would<00:02:59.099> go<00:02:59.280> and<00:02:59.489> buy<00:02:59.610> it

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
ship and I certainly would go and buy it

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.479 
ship and I certainly would go and buy it
again<00:03:00.380> of<00:03:01.380> course<00:03:01.739> with<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.130> ghost<00:03:02.310> pepper

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
again of course with the ghost pepper

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.840 
again of course with the ghost pepper
sauce<00:03:02.880> so<00:03:03.209> it's<00:03:03.560> probably<00:03:04.560> more<00:03:05.040> toward<00:03:05.340> 5<00:03:05.700> out

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
sauce so it's probably more toward 5 out

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:12.020 
sauce so it's probably more toward 5 out
of<00:03:05.880> 5<00:03:06.680> but<00:03:07.680> again<00:03:08.959> as<00:03:09.959> I<00:03:10.950> spill<00:03:11.580> a<00:03:11.610> whole<00:03:11.790> bunch

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
of 5 but again as I spill a whole bunch

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.910
