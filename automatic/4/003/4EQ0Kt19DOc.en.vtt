00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
animals react and exhibits so what we

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.960 
animals react and exhibits so what we
ended<00:02:02.750> up<00:02:02.869> doing<00:02:02.930> took<00:02:03.890> us<00:02:04.010> three<00:02:04.280> weeks<00:02:04.520> which

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
ended up doing took us three weeks which

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.120 
ended up doing took us three weeks which
was<00:02:05.180> really<00:02:05.360> really<00:02:05.479> great<00:02:05.810> and<00:02:06.200> we<00:02:06.440> carefully

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
was really really great and we carefully

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.550 
was really really great and we carefully
planned<00:02:07.880> out<00:02:08.119> how<00:02:08.330> we<00:02:08.390> were<00:02:08.630> going<00:02:08.810> to<00:02:08.959> put<00:02:09.470> the

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
planned out how we were going to put the

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.140 
planned out how we were going to put the
climbing<00:02:09.920> material<00:02:10.459> where<00:02:10.760> we're<00:02:10.880> gonna<00:02:10.940> put

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
climbing material where we're gonna put

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.760 
climbing material where we're gonna put
the<00:02:11.209> plants<00:02:11.720> but<00:02:12.230> I<00:02:12.260> think<00:02:12.500> the<00:02:12.620> most

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
the plants but I think the most

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.590 
the plants but I think the most
important<00:02:13.280> thing<00:02:13.430> it<00:02:13.580> was<00:02:13.790> a<00:02:14.090> group<00:02:14.360> effort

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
important thing it was a group effort

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.570 
important thing it was a group effort
not<00:02:14.990> only<00:02:15.080> were<00:02:15.440> keepers<00:02:15.830> involved<00:02:16.340> in<00:02:16.459> this

Lily Enza in particular still kept

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.720 
Lily Enza in particular still kept
exploring<00:02:51.170> for<00:02:51.560> a<00:02:51.650> quite<00:02:52.130> a<00:02:52.160> long<00:02:52.430> time<00:02:52.700> I

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
exploring for a quite a long time I

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.880 
exploring for a quite a long time I
would<00:02:52.970> say<00:02:53.239> he<00:02:53.420> was<00:02:53.540> exploring<00:02:53.930> every<00:02:54.530> inch<00:02:54.709> of

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
would say he was exploring every inch of

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.100 
would say he was exploring every inch of
his<00:02:55.070> exhibit<00:02:55.610> and<00:02:56.060> it<00:02:56.330> really<00:02:56.540> looked<00:02:56.870> like<00:02:56.930> he

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
his exhibit and it really looked like he

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.930 
his exhibit and it really looked like he
was<00:02:57.230> having<00:02:57.410> a<00:02:57.620> great<00:02:57.739> time<00:02:57.860> and<00:02:58.340> that<00:02:58.489> and<00:02:58.700> as

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
was having a great time and that and as

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.090 
was having a great time and that and as
a<00:02:58.970> keeper<00:02:59.420> that's<00:02:59.840> what<00:03:00.080> you<00:03:00.170> strive<00:03:00.410> for<00:03:00.860> is

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
a keeper that's what you strive for is

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.150 
a keeper that's what you strive for is
to<00:03:01.480> create<00:03:02.480> an<00:03:02.690> exhibit<00:03:03.080> that<00:03:03.650> the<00:03:03.769> animals

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
to create an exhibit that the animals

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.949 
to create an exhibit that the animals
will<00:03:04.250> interact<00:03:04.519> with<00:03:04.850> and<00:03:05.239> I<00:03:05.510> think<00:03:05.750> we<00:03:05.840> were

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
will interact with and I think we were

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:09.070 
will interact with and I think we were
successful<00:03:06.320> this<00:03:06.650> morning
