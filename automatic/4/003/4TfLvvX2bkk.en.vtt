bees machine tutorials series today
we're<00:00:10.469> going<00:00:10.559> to<00:00:10.650> be<00:00:10.710> taking<00:00:10.950> a<00:00:10.980> look<00:00:11.070> at<00:00:11.160> the

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
we're going to be taking a look at the

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.700 
we're going to be taking a look at the
geothermal<00:00:11.880> generator<00:00:11.960> so<00:00:12.960> the<00:00:13.259> geothermal

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
geothermal generator so the geothermal

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.650 
geothermal generator so the geothermal
generator<00:00:13.889> does<00:00:14.460> really<00:00:14.910> have<00:00:15.089> much<00:00:15.360> of<00:00:15.389> a

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
generator does really have much of a

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.660 
generator does really have much of a
user<00:00:15.870> interface<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.949> bottom<00:00:17.279> is<00:00:17.400> where<00:00:17.520> you

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
user interface the bottom is where you

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.250 
user interface the bottom is where you
would<00:00:17.760> put<00:00:17.820> items<00:00:18.600> that<00:00:18.750> you<00:00:18.869> want<00:00:19.050> to<00:00:19.109> burn

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
would put items that you want to burn

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.779 
would put items that you want to burn
such<00:00:19.500> as<00:00:19.619> like<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:19.800> lava<00:00:20.070> bucket<00:00:20.520> you<00:00:20.640> could

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
such as like a lava bucket you could

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.240 
such as like a lava bucket you could
throw<00:00:20.970> on<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.359> bottom<00:00:21.660> here<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:22.080> it'll<00:00:22.680> empty

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
throw on the bottom here and it'll empty

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.160 
throw on the bottom here and it'll empty
it<00:00:23.340> into<00:00:23.640> its<00:00:23.760> internal<00:00:24.180> storage<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:24.720> then

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
it into its internal storage and then

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.150 
it into its internal storage and then
use<00:00:25.949> that<00:00:26.430> liquid<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:27.269> then<00:00:27.930> you<00:00:28.769> know<00:00:28.830> power

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
use that liquid to then you know power

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.589 
use that liquid to then you know power
and<00:00:29.310> MFE<00:00:29.609> or<00:00:29.730> whatever<00:00:29.970> you<00:00:30.029> want<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.330> do<00:00:30.449> the

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
and MFE or whatever you want to do the

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.479 
and MFE or whatever you want to do the
top<00:00:30.779> is<00:00:30.929> for<00:00:31.109> batteries<00:00:31.470> if<00:00:31.650> you<00:00:31.740> want<00:00:31.949> it<00:00:32.070> if

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
top is for batteries if you want it if

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:33.920 
top is for batteries if you want it if
we<00:00:32.579> go<00:00:32.669> ahead<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:32.880> take<00:00:32.969> a<00:00:33.000> look<00:00:33.210> at<00:00:33.300> take<00:00:33.870> a

we go ahead and take a look at take a
look<00:00:34.020> at<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.200> building<00:00:34.350> recipe<00:00:34.829> it's<00:00:35.280> pretty

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
look at the building recipe it's pretty

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.130 
look at the building recipe it's pretty
simple<00:00:35.910> because<00:00:36.090> it's<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.390> pretty<00:00:36.630> it's<00:00:37.050> pretty

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
simple because it's a pretty it's pretty

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.790 
simple because it's a pretty it's pretty
load<00:00:37.440> to<00:00:37.590> your<00:00:37.649> machine<00:00:38.280> it's<00:00:38.910> for<00:00:39.270> glass<00:00:39.800> to

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
load to your machine it's for glass to

load to your machine it's for glass to
empty<00:00:41.160> cells<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.820> then<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.930> refined<00:00:43.350> iron<00:00:43.620> and

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
empty cells and then to refined iron and

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.100 
empty cells and then to refined iron and
a<00:00:44.610> generator<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.329> cool<00:00:45.660> thing<00:00:45.870> with<00:00:46.020> the

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
a generator the cool thing with the

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.049 
a generator the cool thing with the
geothermal<00:00:46.440> generator<00:00:46.649> is<00:00:47.100> that<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:47.789> can<00:00:47.940> be

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
geothermal generator is that it can be

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.910 
geothermal generator is that it can be
automated<00:00:48.420> or<00:00:48.690> you<00:00:48.989> can<00:00:49.140> just<00:00:49.289> manually<00:00:49.649> put

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
automated or you can just manually put

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.889 
automated or you can just manually put
items<00:00:50.190> in<00:00:50.399> so<00:00:50.969> for<00:00:51.149> example<00:00:51.510> if<00:00:51.570> I<00:00:51.629> throw<00:00:51.780> this

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
items in so for example if I throw this

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.750 
items in so for example if I throw this
lava<00:00:52.170> bucket<00:00:52.530> in<00:00:52.620> here<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:53.340> can<00:00:53.489> see<00:00:53.610> that

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
lava bucket in here you can see that

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.130 
lava bucket in here you can see that
it's<00:00:53.850> going<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.000> go<00:00:54.120> ahead<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.449> process<00:00:54.660> this

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
it's going to go ahead and process this

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.380 
it's going to go ahead and process this
lava<00:00:55.350> bucket<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:55.980> then<00:00:56.340> start<00:00:56.640> charging<00:00:57.300> up

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
lava bucket and then start charging up

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.330 
lava bucket and then start charging up
this<00:00:57.539> MFE<00:00:58.079> now<00:00:58.500> I<00:00:58.530> have<00:00:58.829> this<00:00:58.980> one<00:00:59.039> just

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
this MFE now I have this one just

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.130 
this MFE now I have this one just
connected<00:00:59.670> with<00:00:59.760> glass<00:00:59.969> fiber<00:01:00.000> cable<00:01:00.719> and

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
connected with glass fiber cable and

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.380 
connected with glass fiber cable and
it's<00:01:01.289> coming<00:01:01.530> over<00:01:01.620> here<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.129> if<00:01:03.030> we<00:01:03.180> put

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
it's coming over here and if we put

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.000 
it's coming over here and if we put
another<00:01:03.600> bucket<00:01:03.989> in<00:01:04.110> here<00:01:04.260> like<00:01:04.470> for<00:01:04.650> example

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
another bucket in here like for example

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.179 
another bucket in here like for example
let's<00:01:05.640> throw<00:01:06.000> that<00:01:06.030> one<00:01:06.420> in<00:01:06.540> there<00:01:07.189> it'll

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
let's throw that one in there it'll

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.370 
let's throw that one in there it'll
eventually<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:09.330> can<00:01:09.510> start<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:09.900> see<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.200> lava

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
eventually you can start to see the lava

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.590 
eventually you can start to see the lava
build<00:01:10.799> up<00:01:10.979> in<00:01:11.130> here<00:01:11.159> also<00:01:11.909> if<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.299> doesn't<00:01:12.510> have

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
build up in here also if it doesn't have

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.109 
build up in here also if it doesn't have
anything<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:13.080> do<00:01:13.260> it'll<00:01:13.500> also<00:01:13.710> store<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.640> also

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
anything to do it'll also store it also

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.870 
anything to do it'll also store it also
show<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.390> little<00:01:15.659> graphic<00:01:15.990> in<00:01:16.350> there<00:01:16.580> so<00:01:17.580> let's

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
show a little graphic in there so let's

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.490 
show a little graphic in there so let's
just<00:01:18.030> grab<00:01:18.330> another<00:01:18.600> lava<00:01:18.840> bucket<00:01:19.229> for<00:01:19.439> the

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
just grab another lava bucket for the

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.100 
just grab another lava bucket for the
future<00:01:19.890> so<00:01:20.610> now<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.060> can<00:01:21.450> also<00:01:21.600> just<00:01:21.930> pipe

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
future so now you can also just pipe

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.840 
future so now you can also just pipe
lava<00:01:22.409> directly<00:01:22.860> into<00:01:23.250> it<00:01:23.369> which<00:01:23.520> is<00:01:23.670> what<00:01:23.820> I

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
lava directly into it which is what I

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.660 
lava directly into it which is what I
would<00:01:23.970> recommend<00:01:24.439> so<00:01:25.439> if<00:01:25.710> we<00:01:25.920> go<00:01:26.070> ahead<00:01:26.159> and

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
would recommend so if we go ahead and

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.640 
would recommend so if we go ahead and
put<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.360> down<00:01:27.479> right<00:01:27.750> here<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:28.290> can<00:01:28.439> see<00:01:28.470> that

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
put it down right here you can see that

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.800 
put it down right here you can see that
it<00:01:28.770> instantly<00:01:29.070> starts<00:01:29.729> getting<00:01:30.180> lava<00:01:30.360> put<00:01:30.689> in

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
it instantly starts getting lava put in

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.569 
it instantly starts getting lava put in
there<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.170> can<00:01:31.380> see<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:32.189> love<00:01:32.400> is

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
there and you can see the love is

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.490 
there and you can see the love is
starting<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.000> store<00:01:33.299> up<00:01:33.450> in<00:01:33.630> there<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.020> it's

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
starting to store up in there and it's

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.649 
starting to store up in there and it's
going<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:34.710> keep<00:01:34.890> processing<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.610> lava<00:01:35.880> at<00:01:36.240> a

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
going to keep processing the lava at a

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.289 
going to keep processing the lava at a
very<00:01:36.900> slow<00:01:37.200> rate<00:01:37.229> now<00:01:37.920> if<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.729> have<00:01:39.150> the

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
very slow rate now if you have the

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.789 
very slow rate now if you have the
resources<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:39.960> would<00:01:40.020> recommend<00:01:40.470> getting<00:01:40.650> a

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
resources I would recommend getting a

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.800 
resources I would recommend getting a
geothermal<00:01:41.159> generator<00:01:41.549> you<00:01:42.360> can<00:01:42.390> see<00:01:42.600> that<00:01:42.720> we

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
geothermal generator you can see that we

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.880 
geothermal generator you can see that we
emptied<00:01:43.140> out<00:01:43.229> this<00:01:43.439> 16,000<00:01:44.780> unit<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:46.710> side

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
emptied out this 16,000 unit the side

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.530 
emptied out this 16,000 unit the side
craft<00:01:47.159> take<00:01:47.369> pretty<00:01:47.610> easily<00:01:48.149> into<00:01:48.420> this

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
craft take pretty easily into this

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.359 
craft take pretty easily into this
machine<00:01:48.930> so<00:01:49.500> it's<00:01:49.619> got<00:01:49.770> a<00:01:49.799> pretty<00:01:50.040> large

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
machine so it's got a pretty large

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.240 
machine so it's got a pretty large
internal<00:01:50.970> storage<00:01:51.420> so<00:01:51.799> this<00:01:52.799> is<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.100> way<00:01:53.220> I

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
internal storage so this is the way I

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.740 
internal storage so this is the way I
would<00:01:53.549> recommend<00:01:54.030> doing<00:01:54.180> it<00:01:54.450> I<00:01:54.540> don't

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
would recommend doing it I don't

you prefer and automating it that way so

with manual inputs such as just putting

with manual inputs such as just putting
lava<00:02:11.470> buckets<00:02:11.920> into<00:02:12.280> it<00:02:12.460> is<00:02:12.580> a<00:02:13.180> little<00:02:13.510> weird<00:02:13.750> I

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
lava buckets into it is a little weird I

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.540 
lava buckets into it is a little weird I
also<00:02:14.230> don't<00:02:14.470> recommend<00:02:14.620> it<00:02:15.010> just<00:02:15.220> because<00:02:15.430> you

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
also don't recommend it just because you

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.250 
also don't recommend it just because you
have<00:02:15.670> to<00:02:15.790> deal<00:02:16.000> with<00:02:16.150> processing<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:16.840> buckets

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
have to deal with processing the buckets

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.620 
have to deal with processing the buckets
and<00:02:17.440> then<00:02:17.860> also<00:02:18.070> getting<00:02:18.880> the<00:02:19.090> buckets<00:02:19.420> back

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
and then also getting the buckets back

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.530 
and then also getting the buckets back
out<00:02:19.840> a<00:02:19.870> machine<00:02:20.260> is<00:02:20.680> kind<00:02:21.130> of<00:02:21.280> weird<00:02:21.670> so<00:02:22.270> for

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
out a machine is kind of weird so for

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.270 
out a machine is kind of weird so for
example<00:02:22.930> if<00:02:23.020> we<00:02:23.170> grab<00:02:23.410> a<00:02:23.440> lava<00:02:23.710> bucket<00:02:24.130> real

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
example if we grab a lava bucket real

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.720 
example if we grab a lava bucket real
fast<00:02:24.550> and<00:02:25.050> we<00:02:26.050> throw<00:02:26.260> it<00:02:26.410> in<00:02:26.500> the<00:02:26.590> bottom<00:02:26.920> it's

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
fast and we throw it in the bottom it's

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.340 
fast and we throw it in the bottom it's
going<00:02:27.910> to<00:02:28.000> get<00:02:28.150> sucked<00:02:28.420> into<00:02:28.570> there<00:02:28.870> now<00:02:29.290> we

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
going to get sucked into there now we

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.830 
going to get sucked into there now we
need<00:02:29.530> to<00:02:29.590> wrench<00:02:29.770> this<00:02:29.920> back<00:02:30.160> down<00:02:30.720> it's<00:02:31.720> going

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
need to wrench this back down it's going

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.090 
need to wrench this back down it's going
to<00:02:31.900> get<00:02:32.050> sucked<00:02:32.230> into<00:02:32.410> the<00:02:32.590> geothermal

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
to get sucked into the geothermal

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.640 
to get sucked into the geothermal
generator<00:02:33.130> and<00:02:33.730> it'll<00:02:34.240> get<00:02:34.390> inputted<00:02:34.960> into<00:02:35.260> it

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
generator and it'll get inputted into it

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.590 
generator and it'll get inputted into it
and<00:02:35.860> you<00:02:36.730> can<00:02:36.760> see<00:02:36.970> that<00:02:37.090> we<00:02:37.180> now<00:02:37.300> have<00:02:37.480> an

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
and you can see that we now have an

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.050 
and you can see that we now have an
empty<00:02:37.690> bucket<00:02:38.050> however<00:02:38.620> that's<00:02:39.400> not<00:02:39.610> pulling

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
empty bucket however that's not pulling

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.760 
empty bucket however that's not pulling
it<00:02:40.120> out<00:02:40.240> this<00:02:40.600> side<00:02:40.780> doesn't<00:02:40.990> pull<00:02:41.260> it<00:02:41.350> out<00:02:41.440> the

it out this side doesn't pull it out the

it out this side doesn't pull it out the
back<00:02:42.010> the<00:02:42.340> top<00:02:42.580> none<00:02:43.150> of<00:02:43.180> it<00:02:43.390> pulls<00:02:43.630> it<00:02:43.810> out<00:02:43.900> you

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
back the top none of it pulls it out you

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.920 
back the top none of it pulls it out you
actually<00:02:44.650> have<00:02:44.920> to<00:02:45.040> flip<00:02:45.310> the<00:02:45.460> pipe<00:02:45.670> around<00:02:45.930> to

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
actually have to flip the pipe around to

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.360 
actually have to flip the pipe around to
where<00:02:47.170> the<00:02:47.200> same<00:02:47.560> side<00:02:47.800> that<00:02:47.890> you<00:02:47.980> in<00:02:48.100> put<00:02:48.280> it

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
where the same side that you in put it

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.310 
where the same side that you in put it
in<00:02:48.550> and<00:02:48.790> it'll<00:02:49.240> take<00:02:49.420> the<00:02:49.540> bucket<00:02:49.840> back<00:02:50.020> out

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
in and it'll take the bucket back out

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.400 
in and it'll take the bucket back out
now<00:02:50.950> I<00:02:51.280> don't<00:02:51.820> really<00:02:52.120> know<00:02:52.390> how<00:02:52.540> you<00:02:52.600> automate

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
now I don't really know how you automate

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.040 
now I don't really know how you automate
this<00:02:53.620> with<00:02:53.800> a<00:02:53.830> machine<00:02:54.280> so<00:02:54.730> it'll<00:02:55.690> be<00:02:55.810> pretty

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
this with a machine so it'll be pretty

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.110 
this with a machine so it'll be pretty
pretty<00:02:56.410> tricky<00:02:57.010> you<00:02:57.460> could<00:02:57.640> always<00:02:57.760> just<00:02:57.940> have

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
pretty tricky you could always just have

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.090 
pretty tricky you could always just have
the<00:02:58.240> things<00:02:58.450> stack<00:02:58.780> up<00:02:58.990> in<00:02:59.140> there<00:02:59.320> however<00:02:59.800> I

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
the things stack up in there however I

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.360 
the things stack up in there however I
believe<00:03:00.460> the<00:03:00.940> machine<00:03:01.270> will<00:03:01.810> just<00:03:02.650> not<00:03:03.100> know

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
believe the machine will just not know

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:04.440 
believe the machine will just not know
what<00:03:03.520> to<00:03:03.610> do<00:03:03.760> with<00:03:03.880> it<00:03:04.030> will<00:03:04.120> probably<00:03:04.360> just

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
what to do with it will probably just

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.780 
what to do with it will probably just
spit<00:03:04.720> it<00:03:04.870> out<00:03:04.960> so<00:03:05.770> I<00:03:06.130> highly<00:03:06.760> recommend

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
spit it out so I highly recommend

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.710 
spit it out so I highly recommend
against<00:03:07.630> using<00:03:08.040> buckets<00:03:09.040> so<00:03:09.390> I'm<00:03:10.390> just<00:03:10.600> going

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
against using buckets so I'm just going

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.090 
against using buckets so I'm just going
to<00:03:10.810> give<00:03:10.900> you<00:03:10.960> a<00:03:10.990> quick<00:03:11.230> demonstration<00:03:11.440> on<00:03:11.980> a

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
to give you a quick demonstration on a

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.640 
to give you a quick demonstration on a
use<00:03:12.430> for<00:03:12.910> the<00:03:13.150> geothermal<00:03:13.630> generator<00:03:13.810> here<00:03:14.620> I

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:14.650 
use for the geothermal generator here I

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.890 
use for the geothermal generator here I
have<00:03:14.890> a<00:03:14.920> magma<00:03:15.310> crucible<00:03:15.760> with<00:03:16.150> netherrack<00:03:16.660> in

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
have a magma crucible with netherrack in

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.110

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.270 
this will do is that this will start

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.510 
this will do is that this will start
melting<00:03:28.540> the<00:03:29.050> netherrack<00:03:29.740> and<00:03:30.100> it<00:03:30.430> will

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 
melting the netherrack and it will

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.060 
melting the netherrack and it will
produce<00:03:30.730> a<00:03:31.090> lava<00:03:31.390> for<00:03:31.840> you<00:03:31.990> this<00:03:32.470> is<00:03:32.620> a<00:03:32.650> pretty

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
produce a lava for you this is a pretty

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:36.150 
produce a lava for you this is a pretty

this<00:03:41.230> in<00:03:41.890> this<00:03:42.010> method<00:03:42.220> we<00:03:42.550> have<00:03:43.240> nothing<00:03:43.600> new

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
this in this method we have nothing new

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.440 
this in this method we have nothing new
to<00:03:43.840> you<00:03:44.250> so<00:03:45.250> this<00:03:45.640> lava<00:03:45.880> is<00:03:45.970> going<00:03:46.090> to<00:03:46.150> come<00:03:46.300> out

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
to you so this lava is going to come out

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:47.640 
to you so this lava is going to come out
some<00:03:46.720> of<00:03:46.840> it's<00:03:46.960> going<00:03:47.110> to<00:03:47.170> go<00:03:47.290> into<00:03:47.560> the

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
some of it's going to go into the

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.500 
some of it's going to go into the
magmatic<00:03:48.010> engine<00:03:48.520> and<00:03:48.670> some<00:03:49.060> is<00:03:49.210> going<00:03:49.330> to<00:03:49.390> go

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
magmatic engine and some is going to go

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.800 
magmatic engine and some is going to go
into<00:03:49.720> the<00:03:49.810> geothermal<00:03:50.230> generator<00:03:50.460> now

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
into the geothermal generator now

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.580 
into the geothermal generator now
usually<00:03:52.810> you're<00:03:53.200> going<00:03:53.350> to<00:03:53.410> have<00:03:53.500> to

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
usually you're going to have to

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.140 
usually you're going to have to
kick-start<00:03:53.830> your<00:03:54.070> magnetic<00:03:54.490> engine<00:03:54.910> however

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
kick-start your magnetic engine however

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.080 
kick-start your magnetic engine however
I<00:03:55.480> pre<00:03:56.290> powered<00:03:56.620> this<00:03:56.770> machine<00:03:57.190> with<00:03:57.850> a

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
I pre powered this machine with a

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.570 
I pre powered this machine with a
redstone<00:03:58.450> energy<00:03:58.990> cell<00:03:59.260> so<00:04:00.010> as<00:04:00.280> you<00:04:00.430> can<00:04:00.520> see

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 
redstone energy cell so as you can see

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.730 
redstone energy cell so as you can see
there<00:04:00.850> this<00:04:01.060> works<00:04:01.330> pretty<00:04:01.540> well<00:04:01.690> and<00:04:02.110> it's

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:02.740 
there this works pretty well and it's

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.650 
there this works pretty well and it's
only<00:04:02.920> one<00:04:03.220> wide<00:04:03.460> yeah<00:04:04.030> you'll<00:04:04.240> have<00:04:04.330> to<00:04:04.540> leave

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
only one wide yeah you'll have to leave

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.990 
only one wide yeah you'll have to leave
a<00:04:04.690> gap<00:04:04.930> for<00:04:05.620> the<00:04:05.890> other<00:04:06.010> one<00:04:06.220> or<00:04:06.670> else<00:04:06.790> your

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
a gap for the other one or else your

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.490 
a gap for the other one or else your
pipes<00:04:07.209> will<00:04:07.360> connect<00:04:07.720> to<00:04:07.810> each<00:04:07.930> other<00:04:08.110> and

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
pipes will connect to each other and

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.290 
pipes will connect to each other and
there<00:04:09.220> won't<00:04:09.340> be<00:04:09.459> there'll<00:04:10.000> be<00:04:10.030> too<00:04:10.209> much

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.300 
there won't be there'll be too much

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.660 
there won't be there'll be too much
distribution<00:04:10.990> for<00:04:11.230> the<00:04:11.320> lava<00:04:11.530> so<00:04:11.860> I<00:04:12.070> recommend

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
distribution for the lava so I recommend

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.430 
distribution for the lava so I recommend
keeping<00:04:12.820> a<00:04:13.030> one<00:04:13.180> block<00:04:13.360> gap<00:04:13.870> between<00:04:14.140> these

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
keeping a one block gap between these

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.510 
keeping a one block gap between these
two<00:04:14.620> and<00:04:14.890> it's<00:04:15.370> one<00:04:16.209> block<00:04:16.710> one<00:04:17.710> block<00:04:17.979> wide<00:04:18.220> so

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:18.520 
two and it's one block one block wide so

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:19.940 
two and it's one block one block wide so
it's<00:04:18.700> pretty<00:04:18.850> easy<00:04:18.970> to<00:04:19.239> fit<00:04:19.450> into<00:04:19.600> your

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
it's pretty easy to fit into your

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.220 
it's pretty easy to fit into your
somewhere<00:04:20.400> to<00:04:21.210> pick<00:04:21.450> up<00:04:21.570> the<00:04:21.720> geothermal

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.230 
somewhere to pick up the geothermal

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:23.690 
somewhere to pick up the geothermal
generator<00:04:22.260> you<00:04:22.980> can<00:04:23.130> use<00:04:23.280> any<00:04:23.490> of<00:04:23.580> the

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
generator you can use any of the

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.970 
generator you can use any of the
wrenches<00:04:24.030> at<00:04:24.240> work<00:04:24.510> however<00:04:25.050> I<00:04:25.290> recommend<00:04:25.560> the

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:25.980 
wrenches at work however I recommend the

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:27.650 
wrenches at work however I recommend the
electric<00:04:26.370> wrench<00:04:26.610> and<00:04:26.910> what<00:04:27.390> you're<00:04:27.510> going<00:04:27.600> to

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
electric wrench and what you're going to

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:28.550 
electric wrench and what you're going to
want<00:04:27.780> to<00:04:27.840> do<00:04:27.930> is<00:04:28.020> make<00:04:28.200> sure<00:04:28.230> it's<00:04:28.350> some

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
want to do is make sure it's some

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.990 
want to do is make sure it's some
lossless<00:04:29.070> mode<00:04:29.280> so<00:04:29.430> you're<00:04:29.520> going<00:04:29.640> to<00:04:29.700> hold

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
lossless mode so you're going to hold

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.850

the machine and you'll get it back like
I<00:04:42.960> said<00:04:43.140> earlier<00:04:43.500> guys<00:04:43.680> if<00:04:43.890> you<00:04:44.280> can<00:04:44.460> afford

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
I said earlier guys if you can afford

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.160 
I said earlier guys if you can afford
the<00:04:44.850> thermal<00:04:45.180> generator<00:04:45.540> then<00:04:45.900> I<00:04:45.990> would

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:46.170 
the thermal generator then I would

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:47.450 
the thermal generator then I would
recommend<00:04:46.560> doing<00:04:46.680> it<00:04:46.860> it's<00:04:47.010> a<00:04:47.130> lot<00:04:47.310> more

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
recommend doing it it's a lot more

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.000 
recommend doing it it's a lot more
efficient<00:04:47.880> than<00:04:48.030> this<00:04:48.150> geothermal<00:04:48.810> generator

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
efficient than this geothermal generator

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.410 
efficient than this geothermal generator
but<00:04:50.010> that<00:04:50.370> is<00:04:50.490> going<00:04:50.610> to<00:04:50.670> be<00:04:50.760> it<00:04:50.880> for<00:04:50.910> this

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:51.420 
but that is going to be it for this
