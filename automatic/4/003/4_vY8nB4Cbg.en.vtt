00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:04.790
 located inside the lobe 

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:06.609
 temporal the hippocampus is a deposit 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.609
 prepared to store the information 

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:09.609
 recent 

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.200
 here you can store a package of 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.030
 information for hours days or even 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.480
 years before moving to memory 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:19.480
 permanent 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.980
 at the Washington University of Sanluis 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.500
 the researchers used a scanner 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.300
 page to map the route of 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.070
 the memory in the brain during the 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.070
 information storage process 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.899
 in this experiment the person memorizes 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.730
 a list of words that you should then 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:42.390
 remember using only the 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.440
 first three letters of each word 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.629
 observing the reconstruction process 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.309
 of the word complete scientists 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:52.140
 determine the parts of the brain that 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.140
 intervene in the function of memory 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.190
 cool 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.200
 researchers have discovered a 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.360
 high level of activity in the 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.590
 depths of the brain in one place 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.590
 called hippocampus 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:21.460
 the name comes from the Latin word 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.460
 sea ​​horse that resembles 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:31.130
 in the hippocampus rows of 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.259
 about 40 million nerve cells 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.210
 these cells allow storage in the 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.990
 memory the information that comes from 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.990
 our senses 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.330
 when we memorize someone's face the 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.659
 fragmented into shapes 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.659
 simpler 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.030
 these fragments of information and they arrive 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.070
 to the hippocampus 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.070
 the hippocampus is part of the system 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.840
 limbic with the brain between his 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.260
 functions also figure the regular 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.260
 the emotions 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.670
 the hippocampus processes and evaluates these 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.380
 fragments and then wait for him 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.410
 get more information from the 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.790
 senses and the rest of the limbic system 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.200
 to decide whether the face should be or not 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.200
 filed in memory
