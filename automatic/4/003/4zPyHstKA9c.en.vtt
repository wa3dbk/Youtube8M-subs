Hertz<00:00:23.730> let's<00:00:24.720> go<00:00:24.869> over<00:00:25.019> to<00:00:25.050> crossover<00:00:25.320> first

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
Hertz let's go over to crossover first

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.830 
Hertz let's go over to crossover first
actually<00:00:26.310> Bert's<00:00:26.910> designed<00:00:27.300> this<00:00:27.449> crossover

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
actually Bert's designed this crossover

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.200 
actually Bert's designed this crossover
to<00:00:28.019> be<00:00:28.199> very<00:00:28.439> compact<00:00:28.980> so<00:00:29.220> for<00:00:29.460> installations

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
to be very compact so for installations

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.209 
to be very compact so for installations
it's<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:30.960> breeze<00:00:31.199> for<00:00:31.439> us<00:00:31.560> because<00:00:32.009> we<00:00:32.130> don't

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
it's a breeze for us because we don't

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.190 
it's a breeze for us because we don't
have<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.489> mount<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.850> huge<00:00:33.180> crossover<00:00:33.660> somewhere

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
have to mount a huge crossover somewhere

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.530 
have to mount a huge crossover somewhere
especially<00:00:34.710> in<00:00:34.800> these<00:00:35.000> new-age<00:00:36.000> cars<00:00:36.329> where

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
especially in these new-age cars where

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.459 
especially in these new-age cars where
everything<00:00:36.809> is<00:00:36.870> getting<00:00:37.110> tighter<00:00:37.350> and

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
everything is getting tighter and

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.740 
everything is getting tighter and
tighter<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:38.040> tighter<00:00:38.460> that's<00:00:39.000> definitely<00:00:39.600> a

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
tighter and tighter that's definitely a

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.930 
tighter and tighter that's definitely a
problem<00:00:39.960> definitely<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:41.010> great<00:00:41.670> great

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
problem definitely a great great

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.000 
problem definitely a great great
crossover<00:00:42.390> as<00:00:42.719> you<00:00:43.140> can<00:00:43.230> see<00:00:43.379> though<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.860> also

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
crossover as you can see though it also

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.889 
crossover as you can see though it also
has<00:00:44.219> vents<00:00:44.579> on<00:00:44.730> them<00:00:44.850> so<00:00:45.059> you<00:00:45.420> won't<00:00:45.780> have

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
has vents on them so you won't have

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.540 
has vents on them so you won't have
problems<00:00:45.960> with<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:46.680> getting<00:00:46.950> hot<00:00:47.160> or<00:00:47.460> anything

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
problems with it getting hot or anything

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.720 
problems with it getting hot or anything
else<00:00:47.969> let's<00:00:48.899> move<00:00:49.050> on<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.469> tweeter<00:00:49.829> it's<00:00:50.670> a

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
else let's move on to the tweeter it's a

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.910 
else let's move on to the tweeter it's a
pretty<00:00:50.910> decent<00:00:51.719> sized<00:00:51.870> Twitter<00:00:52.230> yeah<00:00:52.770> it's

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
pretty decent sized Twitter yeah it's

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.279 
pretty decent sized Twitter yeah it's
actually<00:00:53.120> oversize<00:00:54.120> 1<00:00:54.660> inch<00:00:54.809> tweeter<00:00:55.140> as

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
actually oversize 1 inch tweeter as

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.500 
actually oversize 1 inch tweeter as
compared<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.860> 3/4<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.610> inch<00:00:56.760> tweeter

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
compared to a 3/4 of inch tweeter

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.840 
compared to a 3/4 of inch tweeter
compared<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.140> everybody<00:00:58.440> else<00:00:58.829> what<00:00:59.670> that

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
compared to everybody else what that

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.569 
compared to everybody else what that
does<00:01:00.059> it<00:01:00.239> gives<00:01:00.270> us<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:00.629> wide<00:01:00.840> dispersion<00:01:01.579> so

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
does it gives us a wide dispersion so

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.870 
does it gives us a wide dispersion so
when<00:01:02.730> we're<00:01:02.879> in<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.090> car<00:01:03.329> or<00:01:03.570> in<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.769> car<00:01:05.010> we're

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
when we're in a car or in a car we're

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.340 
when we're in a car or in a car we're
not<00:01:06.030> really<00:01:06.240> sitting<00:01:06.570> next<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:06.990> tweeters

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
not really sitting next to the tweeters

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.679 
not really sitting next to the tweeters
sometimes<00:01:07.740> this<00:01:08.369> gives<00:01:08.670> us<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:09.000> great<00:01:09.299> sound

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
sometimes this gives us a great sound

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.690 
sometimes this gives us a great sound
from<00:01:09.990> wherever<00:01:10.170> we're<00:01:10.500> sitting<00:01:10.799> it's<00:01:11.520> made

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
from wherever we're sitting it's made

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.090 
from wherever we're sitting it's made
out<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:11.850> Teflon<00:01:12.119> what<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:12.720> is<00:01:12.900> it's<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.200> cotton

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
out of Teflon what that is it's a cotton

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.620 
out of Teflon what that is it's a cotton
silk<00:01:14.909> composite<00:01:15.900> material<00:01:17.119> allows<00:01:18.119> us<00:01:18.330> to<00:01:18.479> get

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
silk composite material allows us to get

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.840 
silk composite material allows us to get
the<00:01:18.840> best<00:01:19.140> sound<00:01:19.350> quality<00:01:19.530> very<00:01:20.250> efficient

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.539 
pretty unique looking mid bass driver
yeah<00:01:31.020> this<00:01:31.200> is<00:01:31.320> their<00:01:31.500> 16<00:01:31.860> average<00:01:32.159> mid<00:01:32.369> bass

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
yeah this is their 16 average mid bass

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.390 
yeah this is their 16 average mid bass
driver<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:33.000> goes<00:01:33.150> with<00:01:33.329> this<00:01:33.450> component<00:01:34.020> set

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
driver that goes with this component set

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.969 
driver that goes with this component set
this<00:01:35.400> is<00:01:35.579> actually<00:01:35.939> a<00:01:36.000> damped<00:01:36.630> XL<00:01:37.350> mesh<00:01:37.650> fiber

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
this is actually a damped XL mesh fiber

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.039 
this is actually a damped XL mesh fiber
it<00:01:38.610> looks<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.909> lot<00:01:39.030> like<00:01:39.180> carbon<00:01:39.540> fiber<00:01:39.570> it's

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
it looks a lot like carbon fiber it's

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.960 
it looks a lot like carbon fiber it's
very<00:01:40.409> strong<00:01:40.799> very<00:01:41.100> lightweight<00:01:41.460> so<00:01:41.670> we're

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
very strong very lightweight so we're

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.179 
very strong very lightweight so we're
going<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.150> produce<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.780> best<00:01:42.810> mid<00:01:43.290> bass<00:01:43.470> sound

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
going to produce the best mid bass sound

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.010 
going to produce the best mid bass sound
quality<00:01:44.579> possible<00:01:45.060> it's<00:01:45.570> an<00:01:45.720> interesting

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
quality possible it's an interesting

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.319 
quality possible it's an interesting
design<00:01:46.380> in<00:01:46.740> this<00:01:46.920> column<00:01:47.490> here<00:01:47.670> what<00:01:48.060> is<00:01:48.180> that

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
design in this column here what is that

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.179 
design in this column here what is that
key<00:01:48.479> that's<00:01:48.659> called<00:01:48.930> they<00:01:49.350> call<00:01:49.560> it<00:01:49.710> V<00:01:49.920> cone

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
key that's called they call it V cone

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.010 
key that's called they call it V cone
what<00:01:50.430> that<00:01:50.610> is<00:01:50.820> again<00:01:51.329> it's<00:01:51.540> for<00:01:51.720> wide

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
what that is again it's for wide

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.100 
what that is again it's for wide
