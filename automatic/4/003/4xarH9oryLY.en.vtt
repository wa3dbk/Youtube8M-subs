necessary

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.950 

and<00:01:25.640> there's<00:01:26.640> really<00:01:26.850> no<00:01:27.090> right<00:01:27.360> or<00:01:27.390> wrong<00:01:27.690> way

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
and there's really no right or wrong way

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.860 
and there's really no right or wrong way
you<00:01:27.990> can<00:01:28.350> even<00:01:28.590> turn<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.640> sponge<00:01:30.120> as<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.600> blot

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:30.870 
you can even turn the sponge as you blot

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:45.550 
you can even turn the sponge as you blot
just<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.260> blend<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.800> colors<00:01:32.250> in<00:01:32.280> together

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.340 

and<00:01:45.680> then<00:01:46.340> I<00:01:46.369> think<00:01:46.909> I<00:01:47.180> decided<00:01:47.810> that<00:01:47.990> I<00:01:48.200> needed

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
and then I think I decided that I needed

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.440 
and then I think I decided that I needed
more<00:01:48.829> of<00:01:48.979> the<00:01:49.159> blue<00:01:49.369> color<00:01:49.670> so<00:01:50.030> I<00:01:50.060> went<00:01:50.329> ahead

more of the blue color so I went ahead

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.780 
more of the blue color so I went ahead
and<00:01:50.899> just<00:01:50.960> applied<00:01:51.860> more<00:01:52.070> of<00:01:52.189> the<00:01:52.310> blue<00:01:52.549> nail

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
and just applied more of the blue nail

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.910 
and just applied more of the blue nail
polish<00:01:53.000> onto<00:01:53.390> the<00:01:53.630> ledge<00:01:53.780> and<00:01:54.020> then<00:01:54.200> I<00:01:54.409> just

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
polish onto the ledge and then I just

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:04.120 
polish onto the ledge and then I just
dabbed<00:01:55.549> it<00:01:55.729> on<00:02:02.170> ok<00:02:03.170> so<00:02:03.229> I'm<00:02:03.500> taking<00:02:03.799> a<00:02:03.890> q-tip

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
dabbed it on ok so I'm taking a q-tip

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.310 
dabbed it on ok so I'm taking a q-tip
