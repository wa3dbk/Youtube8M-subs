00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
the throttle thing right here which does

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.819 
the throttle thing right here which does
work<00:00:44.160> good<00:00:44.780> it's<00:00:45.780> just<00:00:45.870> not<00:00:46.200> hooked<00:00:46.440> up<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.739> the

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
work good it's just not hooked up to the

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.760 
work good it's just not hooked up to the
carb<00:00:47.070> right<00:00:47.309> right<00:00:47.550> now<00:00:48.200> as<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.440> on/off

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
carb right right now as the on/off

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.950 
carb right right now as the on/off
switch<00:00:50.070> which<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:50.820> would<00:00:50.969> assume<00:00:51.300> works<00:00:51.600> but

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
switch which I would assume works but

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.069 
switch which I would assume works but
they<00:00:52.289> disss<00:00:54.410> they<00:00:55.410> took<00:00:55.680> this<00:00:55.890> off<00:00:57.079> probably

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
they disss they took this off probably

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.720 
they disss they took this off probably
because<00:00:58.530> they're<00:00:58.710> trying<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:59.100> start<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.609> and

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
because they're trying to start it and

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.970 
because they're trying to start it and
they<00:01:00.120> wanted<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.140> see<00:01:01.350> if<00:01:01.410> they<00:01:01.530> could<00:01:01.590> started

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
they wanted to see if they could started

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.860 
they wanted to see if they could started
before<00:01:02.100> they<00:01:02.399> scrapped<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:02.910> but<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.570> reason

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
before they scrapped it but the reason

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.070 
before they scrapped it but the reason
why<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.019> was<00:01:04.199> scrapped<00:01:04.619> was<00:01:05.869> not<00:01:06.869> much

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
why it was scrapped was not much

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.469 
why it was scrapped was not much
compression<00:01:10.430> it<00:01:11.430> has<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.549> little<00:01:11.850> compression

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
compression it has a little compression

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.620 
compression it has a little compression
but<00:01:13.290> not<00:01:13.530> enough<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.950> run<00:01:14.180> it<00:01:15.180> does<00:01:15.390> have<00:01:15.570> a

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
but not enough to run it does have a

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.280 
but not enough to run it does have a
scorch<00:01:15.990> cylinder<00:01:16.530> I<00:01:16.710> saw<00:01:17.270> in<00:01:18.270> there<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:20.030> yeah

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
scorch cylinder I saw in there and yeah

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:28.469 
scorch cylinder I saw in there and yeah
so<00:01:24.590> that's<00:01:25.590> why<00:01:25.890> they<00:01:26.070> threw<00:01:26.340> it<00:01:26.400> out

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
so that's why they threw it out

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:39.870 
so that's why they threw it out
but<00:01:32.860> as<00:01:33.860> a<00:01:33.920> good<00:01:34.159> full<00:01:34.430> start<00:01:36.369> and<00:01:37.539> yeah

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
but as a good full start and yeah

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.429 
but as a good full start and yeah
overall<00:01:40.880> really<00:01:41.240> good<00:01:41.509> for<00:01:41.720> five<00:01:41.899> bucks<00:01:42.110> as

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 
overall really good for five bucks as

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:44.679 
overall really good for five bucks as
muffler<00:01:42.920> gas<00:01:43.280> tank<00:01:43.579> it<00:01:44.030> just<00:01:44.240> doesn't<00:01:44.570> have

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
muffler gas tank it just doesn't have

00:01:46.419 --> 00:01:46.429 
the grommet and lines it looks like

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:48.160 
the grommet and lines it looks like
someone<00:01:46.759> took<00:01:46.939> that<00:01:47.149> off<00:01:47.330> along<00:01:47.929> with<00:01:47.990> the
