so<00:00:27.720> looking<00:00:28.470> at<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.800> broad<00:00:29.070> well<00:00:29.340> we<00:00:29.760> have

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
so looking at the broad well we have

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.310 
so looking at the broad well we have
it's<00:00:30.900> a<00:00:31.439> 40<00:00:31.859> nanometer<00:00:32.719> process<00:00:33.719> and

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
it's a 40 nanometer process and

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.100 
it's a 40 nanometer process and
improving<00:00:35.250> upon<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.910> hash<00:00:36.149> well<00:00:36.420> from<00:00:36.690> 20

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
improving upon the hash well from 20

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.130 
improving upon the hash well from 20
nanometer<00:00:37.950> so<00:00:38.640> basically<00:00:39.270> in<00:00:39.480> term<00:00:39.719> has<00:00:39.899> not

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
nanometer so basically in term has not

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.160 
nanometer so basically in term has not
change<00:00:40.649> anything<00:00:41.300> substantially<00:00:42.300> on<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.660> cpu

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
change anything substantially on the cpu

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.049 
change anything substantially on the cpu
side<00:00:43.500> do<00:00:43.890> they<00:00:44.040> have<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.340> done<00:00:44.520> some<00:00:44.789> of<00:00:44.940> the

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
side do they have to done some of the

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.740 
side do they have to done some of the
work<00:00:45.239> on<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.600> graphic<00:00:46.050> pipe<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:47.660> pretty<00:00:48.660> much

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
work on the graphic pipe and pretty much

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.380 
work on the graphic pipe and pretty much
it<00:00:49.110> other<00:00:49.500> things<00:00:49.860> are<00:00:50.280> staying<00:00:50.879> in<00:00:50.969> terms<00:00:51.239> of

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
it other things are staying in terms of

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.500 
it other things are staying in terms of
architecture<00:00:52.199> chipsets<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.280> so<00:00:54.120> on<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.449> so

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
architecture chipsets and so on and so

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.130 
architecture chipsets and so on and so
forth<00:00:55.010> and<00:00:56.010> you<00:00:56.250> can<00:00:56.460> expect<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.329> lower<00:00:57.780> power

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
forth and you can expect a lower power

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.290 
forth and you can expect a lower power
for<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.590> dimension<00:00:59.190> for<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.430> same<00:00:59.670> amount<00:00:59.879> of

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
for a dimension for the same amount of

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.479 
for a dimension for the same amount of
performance<00:01:01.050> though<00:01:01.800> there<00:01:02.039> is<00:01:02.219> some

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
performance though there is some

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.469 
performance though there is some
low-hanging<00:01:03.860> fruits<00:01:04.860> improvement<00:01:05.610> in<00:01:05.880> CPU

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
low-hanging fruits improvement in CPU

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.600 
low-hanging fruits improvement in CPU
including<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.409> improved<00:01:07.799> branch<00:01:08.159> prediction

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
including the improved branch prediction

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.969 
including the improved branch prediction
and<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.299> better<00:01:09.540> buffer<00:01:10.080> size<00:01:10.350> bigger<00:01:10.680> buffer

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979

far EMV have the support for these
things<00:03:38.220> much<00:03:38.520> earlier<00:03:38.940> but<00:03:39.540> Intel<00:03:39.990> is<00:03:40.140> not

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320
