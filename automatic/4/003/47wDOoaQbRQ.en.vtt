00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.460

 they are trapped in the bottom of the sea 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.550
 under 13 minutes before that the 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.559
 Recker patrol was scattered by 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.600
 the johnston city had the task of 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:50.750
 recovery of vital information dent 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.120

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.830
 special Russian team participates in 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.600
 numerous combats as you 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.120
 they advanced towards the extraction point 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.760
 on top of skyscrapers in 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.830
 building the building after 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.229
 suffer large amounts of damage from 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.440
 Russian forces collapses just when 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:11.180
 thompson reaches the extraction point 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.130
 good this game although the campaign is 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.120
 short is one of the best shooter that 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:20.050
 there is also that has very good graphics 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:22.030
 post 9 a charter 2 the kingdom of 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.790
 thieves is to play something that you do not 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.800
 you can leave a title of 23 chapters 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.660
 that catches you from the first moment in 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.730
 the one that you move to natan and you check that 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:33.490
 the simple climbing tutorial is better 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:35.700
 that many other whole games uses 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.140
 typical resources of television series 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.380
 It looks like a movie with a good script 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.880
 besides having a good gameplay 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.530
 will keep our interest with a plot 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.080
 organic that leaves at the end of each 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.270
 chapter the need to continue 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.160
 enjoying in front of the screen the 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.440
 keep wondering how are you going to 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.480
 surprise in the next 5 minutes and 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.090
 the desire to want to know how the 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.280
 adventure of nathan drake especially if 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.440
 you like this kind of adventure and what 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.210
 most important keeps you stuck to 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:08.259
 seat 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:10.660
 put 8 devil may cry the game puts us 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.660
 in the feet of dante a feeling or 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.030
 a mix between angel and demon one day 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.800
 a girl named cat goes to her house and 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.750
 asks to join an association in 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.760
 against the demons called the order 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.739
 not in that during is taken on time 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.480
 by a demon hunter sent by 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:27.430
 worlds the lord of the demons that 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.620
 keeps controlled and guarded to each 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.630
 planet guy the order plans 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.940
 eliminate worlds and thus get it out of the 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.890
 throne and for this they need the help of 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.560
 dante that being a nephilim is the only 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.060
 able to defeat worlds history 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.040
 Personally, I like it a lot 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.930
 mainly because here if you notice the 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.940
 history and it's not just an excuse for 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.100
 only kill and kill but fight 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.019
 against bosses that nobody knows who they are 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.090
 until they appear here they talk to you about 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:54.880
 each boss or you present it much earlier 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.390
 of his fight against him besides he has 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:01.570
 very good graphics and good playability 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:03.220
 put 7 to 6 include 4 black black the 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:05.769
 history is in the Caribbean in the century 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.569
 18 in what was called age 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:09.700
 gilt of the pirates 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:11.980
 this time we interpret like very 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.049
 the grandfather of color protagonist of the 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.940
 third installment that marks a new 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.410
 address in the franchise and one step 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.049
 go ahead in what seemed like a 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.120
 worn out formula just like no and it 's a 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:24.340
 young man who abandons his Welsh nacre 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.400
 the oriental indians in search of fame and 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.530
 fortune does not go alone is accompanied by a 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.660
 promise to his young wife to return 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.299
 being a naval officer corsair 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.890
 things seldom happen as they 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:38.079
 they want and this is something that soon 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.970
 he would understand the same who is forced to 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:41.590
 Become a pirate without a course 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.600
 clearer than alcohol and 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.459
 depravity typical of their class 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.260
 black flag keeps the elements 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:49.930
 that have made the 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.510
 franchise excel stealth the 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.190
 silent murders the handling of 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.040
 weapons and the parkour to which we are 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.989
 accustomed is kept present is the 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.709
 best game of the saga in my opinion 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:03.819
 put 6 tomb raider on the edge of the 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.219
 death the no 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:08.439

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:15.370
 he survived and as a myth he allows 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:17.949

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:20.680

 fragile little girl to the hunter evolves and 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.699
 develops together with the good player this 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.530

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:30.110
 budget has a very good story 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:33.920

 a hitman the agent 47 before a mission 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:41.540
 more personal than ever that kills without 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.790
 remorse without leaving a trace and with 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.860

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.110
 good how hard it makes you want to play and

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.400
 to previous deliveries highlighting the 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.710
 inclusion of some new movements 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.170
 as the combat with several enemies to the 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:32.390
 instead of returning the grenades the attacks 

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:35.030

 it is possible to interact with some 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:43.610
 objects from the environment to annihilate the 

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:45.710
 enemies is an excellent game every time 

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:48.020
 that you are progressing makes you want to play and 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:52.490
 play mostly at the end there's a lot 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:54.740
 action put 3 7 to 5 besides being the 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:55.310
 most expensive game so far meets what 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.860
 promised 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:59.540
 the gameplay technical quality and 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.730
 what was expected of the games was 

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:04.490
 maintains during the almost 30 hours that 

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:06.620
 offers its main story does not finish the 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:09.440
 thing there then we still have exploration 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:11.510
 secondary missions mini-games if it's not 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.250
 difficult to make a huge game what 

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:15.230
 complicated is to stop playing 

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:19.100
 beginning to end and then you want more 

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:21.290

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.590
 continues to maintain that brutality to the 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.990
 time to fight and moments of thinking to 

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:51.080

 drama and an unrepeatable staging 

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:12.350
