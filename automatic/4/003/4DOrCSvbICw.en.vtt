00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:18.220 
like staring back at me such as a fish

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.200

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:22.190 
really into doing fillets these days and

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.760 
really into doing fillets these days and
it's<00:00:22.340> really<00:00:22.790> easier<00:00:23.480> to<00:00:24.020> grill<00:00:24.260> a<00:00:24.290> whole<00:00:24.530> fish

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
breaking apart and falling between the

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.990 
breaking apart and falling between the
grates<00:00:28.730> so<00:00:29.330> we<00:00:29.780> can<00:00:29.990> do<00:00:30.200> this<00:00:30.440> a<00:00:30.680> whole<00:00:31.340> grilled

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.310 
trout
I<00:00:33.100> keep<00:00:34.100> thinking<00:00:34.550> they<00:00:34.910> found<00:00:35.300> Nemo

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
okay it's easy it's really easy your

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.149 
okay it's easy it's really easy your
fish<00:00:39.289> is<00:00:39.469> descaled

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:40.159 
fish is descaled

00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:41.889 
fish is descaled
you're<00:00:40.519> just<00:00:40.670> gonna<00:00:40.789> rinse<00:00:41.030> it<00:00:41.210> off<00:00:41.359> you<00:00:41.719> want

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:41.899 
you're just gonna rinse it off you want

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:42.849 
you're just gonna rinse it off you want
to<00:00:41.960> make<00:00:42.050> sure<00:00:42.079> you<00:00:42.260> pat<00:00:42.469> it<00:00:42.499> dry<00:00:42.769> thoroughly

00:00:42.849 --> 00:00:42.859 
to make sure you pat it dry thoroughly

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:45.099 
to make sure you pat it dry thoroughly
okay<00:00:43.550> because<00:00:43.640> that<00:00:43.730> would<00:00:44.030> perhaps<00:00:44.690> make<00:00:44.989> it

00:00:45.099 --> 00:00:45.109 
okay because that would perhaps make it

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:47.500 
okay because that would perhaps make it
stick<00:00:45.409> a<00:00:45.440> bit<00:00:45.909> we're<00:00:46.909> gonna<00:00:46.999> open<00:00:47.179> it<00:00:47.329> up<00:00:47.390> we're
