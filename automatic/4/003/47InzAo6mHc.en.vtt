00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.639 

number<00:01:27.000> four<00:01:27.210> we<00:01:27.479> have<00:01:27.689> conflicts<00:01:28.350> somebody

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:28.649 
number four we have conflicts somebody

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:30.169 
number four we have conflicts somebody
who's<00:01:28.859> been<00:01:28.890> in<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.189> top<00:01:29.369> five<00:01:29.579> saves<00:01:29.820> of<00:01:30.090> the

00:01:30.169 --> 00:01:30.179 
who's been in the top five saves of the

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:31.730 
who's been in the top five saves of the
week<00:01:30.329> multiple<00:01:30.869> times<00:01:31.049> now<00:01:31.320> I<00:01:31.350> think<00:01:31.500> this<00:01:31.649> is

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
week multiple times now I think this is

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.740 
week multiple times now I think this is
the<00:01:31.829> third<00:01:31.979> time<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.490> he's<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.270> great<00:01:33.420> goalie

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
the third time and he's a great goalie

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.179 
the third time and he's a great goalie
and<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.020> great<00:01:34.200> player<00:01:34.500> think<00:01:34.770> is<00:01:34.860> even<00:01:35.009> better

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
and a great player think is even better

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.310 
and a great player think is even better
striker<00:01:35.549> than<00:01:35.789> his<00:01:35.939> goalkeeper<00:01:36.539> but<00:01:37.229> they're

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
striker than his goalkeeper but they're

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.389 
striker than his goalkeeper but they're
going<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.500> go<00:01:37.590> ahead<00:01:37.679> and<00:01:37.799> just<00:01:38.100> play<00:01:38.310> around

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
outside the box at the moment and Tecna

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.410

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
the reason being that Upsy volleys are

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:41.539 
the reason being that Upsy volleys are
very<00:02:39.690> powerful<00:02:39.870> and<00:02:40.319> the<00:02:40.440> hard<00:02:40.620> to<00:02:40.739> save<00:02:40.950> but

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
very powerful and the hard to save but

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:43.670 
very powerful and the hard to save but

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
the reason that he did my cup but then
