masterclass<00:01:58.140> penalty<00:01:58.530> taker<00:01:58.770> we've<00:01:59.399> got

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
masterclass penalty taker we've got

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.240 
masterclass penalty taker we've got
rooney<00:02:00.000> pretty<00:02:00.899> good<00:02:01.110> penalty<00:02:01.380> taker<00:02:01.680> we've

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.510 
rooney pretty good penalty taker we've
got<00:02:02.460> Lambert<00:02:02.909> very<00:02:03.299> good<00:02:03.570> penalty<00:02:03.840> taker<00:02:04.110> and

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
got Lambert very good penalty taker and

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.560 
got Lambert very good penalty taker and
I'm<00:02:05.520> sure<00:02:05.729> there's<00:02:05.909> another<00:02:06.060> couple<00:02:06.390> of

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
I'm sure there's another couple of

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:07.670 
I'm sure there's another couple of
players<00:02:06.750> in<00:02:06.960> there<00:02:07.079> that<00:02:07.200> could<00:02:07.229> bang<00:02:07.560> a

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
players in there that could bang a

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.150 
players in there that could bang a
penalty

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
penalty

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.980 
penalty
but<00:02:08.820> this<00:02:08.940> year<00:02:09.120> actually<00:02:09.300> seems<00:02:09.690> like<00:02:09.900> we

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
but this year actually seems like we

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.330 
but this year actually seems like we
might<00:02:10.200> have<00:02:10.230> a<00:02:10.500> child<00:02:10.800> when<00:02:10.980> it<00:02:11.070> goes<00:02:11.190> to

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
might have a child when it goes to

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.610 
might have a child when it goes to
penalties<00:02:11.750> until<00:02:12.750> we<00:02:12.870> actually<00:02:13.050> go<00:02:13.470> into

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
penalties until we actually go into

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.950 
penalties until we actually go into
penalties<00:02:14.160> and<00:02:14.460> get<00:02:14.670> absolutely<00:02:15.420> smashed<00:02:15.720> and

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
penalties and get absolutely smashed and

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.390 
penalties and get absolutely smashed and
probably<00:02:16.170> won't<00:02:16.290> even<00:02:16.440> score<00:02:16.830> one<00:02:17.070> but

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
probably won't even score one but

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.800 
probably won't even score one but
putting<00:02:17.580> that<00:02:17.670> aside<00:02:17.820> i'm<00:02:18.270> actually<00:02:18.480> quite

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810
