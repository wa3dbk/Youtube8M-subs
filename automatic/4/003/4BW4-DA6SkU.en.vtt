quick video on water treatments for your
tropical<00:00:06.720> fish<00:00:07.649> aquarium<00:00:08.210> um<00:00:09.210> I<00:00:10.139> shall<00:00:11.070> wear

tropical fish aquarium um I shall wear
him<00:00:12.620> this<00:00:13.620> is<00:00:13.740> my<00:00:13.860> fish<00:00:14.070> tank<00:00:14.099> it's<00:00:14.610> about<00:00:15.980> 55

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
him this is my fish tank it's about 55

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.609 
him this is my fish tank it's about 55
gallons<00:00:17.460> i<00:00:17.609> believe<00:00:18.770> and<00:00:19.770> i<00:00:21.140> live<00:00:22.140> on<00:00:22.230> a<00:00:22.289> farm

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
gallons i believe and i live on a farm

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.130 
gallons i believe and i live on a farm
so<00:00:22.830> I<00:00:23.640> live<00:00:24.300> on<00:00:24.359> a<00:00:24.420> farm<00:00:24.600> I<00:00:24.750> live<00:00:24.900> out<00:00:25.019> in<00:00:25.109> the

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
so I live on a farm I live out in the

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.689 
so I live on a farm I live out in the
country<00:00:25.199> so<00:00:25.710> we<00:00:26.340> as<00:00:26.400> well<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:28.340> we<00:00:29.340> have<00:00:29.519> our

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
country so we as well and we have our

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.880 
country so we as well and we have our
own<00:00:29.730> largest<00:00:30.390> like<00:00:30.779> water<00:00:31.050> treatment<00:00:31.500> system

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
own largest like water treatment system

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.170 
own largest like water treatment system
so<00:00:32.219> our<00:00:32.940> waters<00:00:33.329> heavy<00:00:34.170> at<00:00:34.800> Lake<00:00:35.040> is<00:00:35.640> heavier

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
so our waters heavy at Lake is heavier

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.380 
so our waters heavy at Lake is heavier
than<00:00:36.270> city<00:00:36.899> water<00:00:37.790> it's<00:00:38.790> probably<00:00:39.180> less

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
than city water it's probably less

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.819 
than city water it's probably less
chlorinated<00:00:40.110> than<00:00:40.260> city<00:00:40.530> water<00:00:42.530> but<00:00:43.530> there's

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
chlorinated than city water but there's

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.100 
chlorinated than city water but there's
still<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:44.100> lot<00:00:44.280> of<00:00:44.309> sulfur<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.420> sediments<00:00:46.050> in

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
still a lot of sulfur and sediments in

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.590 
still a lot of sulfur and sediments in
it<00:00:46.260> so<00:00:46.590> I<00:00:46.620> do<00:00:46.920> have<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.309> treat<00:00:47.460> my<00:00:47.640> water<00:00:47.850> I<00:00:50.600> have

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
it so I do have to treat my water I have

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:59.299 
it so I do have to treat my water I have
I<00:00:52.430> use<00:00:53.430> top<00:00:53.850> then<00:00:54.239> I<00:00:57.199> have<00:00:58.199> tap<00:00:59.039> water

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
I use top then I have tap water

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.290 
I use top then I have tap water

conditioner bacteria supplement and a an
ammonia<00:01:09.210> remover<00:01:11.330> um<00:01:13.369> with<00:01:14.369> these<00:01:14.610> it's

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
ammonia remover um with these it's

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.780 
ammonia remover um with these it's
pretty<00:01:15.360> simple<00:01:15.600> just<00:01:15.860> read<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.070> instructions

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
pretty simple just read the instructions

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.999 
pretty simple just read the instructions
on<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.270> back<00:01:18.420> for<00:01:18.869> how<00:01:19.080> much<00:01:19.259> water<00:01:19.799> you're

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
on the back for how much water you're

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.429 
on the back for how much water you're
adding<00:01:20.369> at<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.490> time<00:01:21.560> so<00:01:23.930> usually<00:01:24.930> I'll<00:01:25.140> only

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
adding at a time so usually I'll only

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.530 
adding at a time so usually I'll only
add<00:01:25.650> water<00:01:25.890> once<00:01:26.130> my<00:01:26.340> tank<00:01:26.580> gets<00:01:26.700> down<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.299> this

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
add water once my tank gets down to this

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:35.420 
add water once my tank gets down to this
point<00:01:30.470> takes<00:01:31.470> maybe<00:01:31.979> three<00:01:32.700> or<00:01:32.759> four<00:01:33.060> days<00:01:34.430> the

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
point takes maybe three or four days the

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.380 
point takes maybe three or four days the
vibrates<00:01:35.970> pretty<00:01:36.930> fast<00:01:37.229> in<00:01:37.500> here<00:01:37.740> so<00:01:38.070> i'll<00:01:38.970> be

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
vibrates pretty fast in here so i'll be

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.380 
vibrates pretty fast in here so i'll be
using<00:01:39.570> like<00:01:39.900> maybe<00:01:40.259> two<00:01:40.650> juice<00:01:40.920> jugs<00:01:41.270> you<00:01:42.270> know

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
using like maybe two juice jugs you know

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.789 
using like maybe two juice jugs you know
and<00:01:44.180> this<00:01:45.180> one<00:01:45.479> says<00:01:46.170> for<00:01:46.770> every<00:01:47.119> for<00:01:48.119> each

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
and this one says for every for each

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.600 
and this one says for every for each
three<00:01:49.799> point<00:01:50.040> seven<00:01:50.220> liters<00:01:50.670> use<00:01:51.000> two<00:01:51.240> jobs

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
three point seven liters use two jobs

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.330 
three point seven liters use two jobs
same<00:01:53.610> for<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.780> water<00:01:55.170> clarifier<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:56.219> the

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
same for the water clarifier and the

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.060 
same for the water clarifier and the
water<00:01:56.520> conditioner<00:01:57.119> for<00:01:57.990> every<00:01:58.200> 19<00:01:58.619> liters

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
water conditioner for every 19 liters

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.499 
water conditioner for every 19 liters
your<00:01:59.790> to<00:02:00.210> use<00:02:00.360> one<00:02:00.810> capful<00:02:01.909> for<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.030> bacteria

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
your to use one capful for the bacteria

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.749 
your to use one capful for the bacteria
supplement<00:02:04.079> I<00:02:04.259> put<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.770> bacteria<00:02:05.250> supplement

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
supplement I put the bacteria supplement

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.830 
supplement I put the bacteria supplement
and<00:02:06.530> act<00:02:07.530> directly<00:02:08.190> in<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:09.000> fish<00:02:09.209> tank<00:02:09.239> like

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
and act directly in the fish tank like

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.400 
and act directly in the fish tank like
I'll<00:02:10.800> drop<00:02:11.640> add

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
I'll drop add

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.450 
the couple of drops the capful i'll add
the<00:02:17.240> cap<00:02:17.450> full<00:02:17.750> into<00:02:19.870> the<00:02:20.870> filter<00:02:21.560> so<00:02:21.950> it<00:02:21.980> helps

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460 
the cap full into the filter so it helps

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.240 
the cap full into the filter so it helps
filter<00:02:22.730> it<00:02:23.030> and<00:02:23.740> same<00:02:24.740> with<00:02:24.770> the<00:02:24.980> ammonia

now and my water quality has gone up and
my<00:02:43.520> fish<00:02:43.820> seem<00:02:44.210> a<00:02:44.570> lot<00:02:44.780> more<00:02:44.810> active<00:02:45.440> unhappy

seems<00:02:56.210> to<00:02:56.390> be<00:02:56.480> working<00:02:56.720> I<00:02:57.310> do<00:02:58.310> have<00:02:58.640> some<00:02:58.850> plant

00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.240 
seems to be working I do have some plant

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.540 
seems to be working I do have some plant
supplements<00:02:59.960> but<00:03:00.200> I'm<00:03:00.620> out<00:03:00.950> at<00:03:01.220> the<00:03:01.370> moment

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
supplements but I'm out at the moment

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.700 
supplements but I'm out at the moment
and<00:03:02.260> I'm<00:03:03.370> don't<00:03:04.370> really<00:03:04.820> use<00:03:05.060> them<00:03:05.330> on<00:03:05.710> the

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:06.710 
and I'm don't really use them on the

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:09.150 
and I'm don't really use them on the
bottom<00:03:07.040> of<00:03:07.160> my<00:03:07.280> tank<00:03:07.610> though<00:03:07.880> I<00:03:07.910> do<00:03:08.120> have

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
bottom of my tank though I do have

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.970 
bottom of my tank though I do have
nutrient<00:03:10.160> plant<00:03:10.640> soil<00:03:11.000> on<00:03:11.330> top<00:03:11.390> of<00:03:12.020> below<00:03:12.800> the

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
nutrient plant soil on top of below the

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:19.300 
nutrient plant soil on top of below the
gravel<00:03:13.400> that's<00:03:14.390> what<00:03:14.690> the<00:03:14.810> darker<00:03:15.170> is<00:03:17.920> but<00:03:18.920> I

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
gravel that's what the darker is but I

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.640 
gravel that's what the darker is but I
don't<00:03:20.150> really<00:03:20.270> add<00:03:20.540> in<00:03:20.750> the<00:03:20.959> plant<00:03:21.170> nutrients

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
don't really add in the plant nutrients

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.830 
don't really add in the plant nutrients
as<00:03:21.830> much<00:03:22.040> as<00:03:22.220> I<00:03:22.280> should<00:03:22.310> I<00:03:22.880> don't<00:03:23.330> have<00:03:23.540> as<00:03:23.690> many

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
as much as I should I don't have as many

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.860 
as much as I should I don't have as many
plants<00:03:24.260> as<00:03:24.380> I<00:03:24.500> did<00:03:24.800> and<00:03:25.120> I<00:03:26.120> don't<00:03:26.480> have<00:03:26.690> the

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
plants as I did and I don't have the

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:31.720 
plants as I did and I don't have the
proper<00:03:27.110> lights<00:03:27.500> for<00:03:28.340> plant<00:03:28.660> so<00:03:30.250> it's<00:03:31.250> really<00:03:31.610> a

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
proper lights for plant so it's really a

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.280 
proper lights for plant so it's really a
waste<00:03:31.970> of<00:03:32.240> money<00:03:32.300> if<00:03:32.600> I<00:03:32.840> don't<00:03:33.020> have<00:03:33.140> the

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
waste of money if I don't have the

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.740 
waste of money if I don't have the
proper<00:03:33.530> lights<00:03:33.830> because<00:03:34.100> my<00:03:34.459> plants<00:03:34.880> don't

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
proper lights because my plants don't

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.570 
proper lights because my plants don't
really<00:03:36.080> do<00:03:36.230> well<00:03:36.260> this<00:03:36.560> is<00:03:36.800> about<00:03:36.950> as<00:03:37.100> well<00:03:37.550> as

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
really do well this is about as well as

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.530 
really do well this is about as well as
they<00:03:37.820> do

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:48.459 

but<00:03:42.519> besides<00:03:43.519> that<00:03:44.500> its<00:03:45.849> top<00:03:46.849> fin<00:03:47.269> I<00:03:47.569> got<00:03:48.109> these

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:48.469 
but besides that its top fin I got these

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:53.800 
but besides that its top fin I got these
from<00:03:50.079> petsmart<00:03:51.079> I<00:03:51.379> believe<00:03:51.890> these<00:03:52.750> these<00:03:53.750> are

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
from petsmart I believe these these are

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.459 
from petsmart I believe these these are
just<00:03:54.049> the<00:03:54.349> small<00:03:54.980> bottles<00:03:56.140> you<00:03:57.140> can<00:03:57.170> get<00:03:57.379> the

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:57.469 
just the small bottles you can get the

00:03:57.469 --> 00:03:59.170 
just the small bottles you can get the
bigger<00:03:57.650> ones<00:03:57.920> I<00:03:58.250> believe<00:03:58.700> these<00:03:58.849> were<00:03:59.000> like

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
bigger ones I believe these were like

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.720 
bigger ones I believe these were like
two<00:03:59.420> bucks<00:03:59.599> each<00:03:59.810> and<00:04:00.560> that<00:04:00.799> one<00:04:00.950> was<00:04:01.159> sex<00:04:01.519> I

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
two bucks each and that one was sex I

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.569 
two bucks each and that one was sex I
think<00:04:02.680> they<00:04:03.680> didn't<00:04:03.859> have<00:04:03.980> the<00:04:04.099> smaller<00:04:04.340> the

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:04.579 
think they didn't have the smaller the

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:05.979 
think they didn't have the smaller the
ammonium<00:04:04.939> on<00:04:05.030> but<00:04:05.209> that's<00:04:05.359> okay<00:04:05.689> because<00:04:05.720> i

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
ammonium on but that's okay because i

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:08.559 
ammonium on but that's okay because i
use<00:04:06.250> you<00:04:07.250> need<00:04:07.430> more<00:04:07.760> of<00:04:07.790> that<00:04:07.939> for<00:04:08.540> each

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:08.569 
use you need more of that for each
