00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.779
 so happy and the button as from the 

00:00:02.679 --> 00:00:06.580
 first day serves has managed to go through 

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:08.770
 an extensive number of generations of 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.660
 consoles providing fun and smiles 

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:12.850
 to millions of players around the 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.950
 world has not even needed to be 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.720
 necessarily tied to a single style of 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.670
 game since he has starred so much 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.619
 exciting adventures as intense 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.080
 racing at full speed or until your 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:25.270
 own version of pinball in 2005 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.279
 kirby canvas corts honorably added 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.320
 to this handful of different titles 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:31.420
 although of great value using the 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.609
 then unique capabilities of nintendo 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.100
 10 to provide a magical journey 

00:00:33.609 --> 00:00:37.839
 through style we helped Kirby to 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.429
 avoid the dangers of creatives 

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:41.319
 scenarios that seemed in paintings 

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:43.030
 tracing a multicolored path that 

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:44.769
 guided his spherical figure while 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.049
 I suffered from the curse of a stranger 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:49.329
 witch called browser ten years later 

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:51.309
 we visit this formula again but 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:53.499
 now with a style that makes it look to 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.659
 the whole game like an amazing ribbon 

00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:57.459
 animated plasticine and although it is not 

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:59.409
 as original or fun as to 

00:00:57.459 --> 00:01:01.869
 we were his predecessor for 10 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:04.210
 kirby andrew rainbow course is molded 

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:06.040
 as an attractive title in others 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.060
 senses the story feels like a 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.920
 déjà vú whole 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.600
 view on canvas only that instead of being 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.990
 a witch who destroys the peace of 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.270
 home 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.280
 the pink hero now we are faced with 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.289
 a sculptor the evil place has already 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.180
 empowered all the popstar color 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:21.130
 leaving it frozen in time and without 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.020
 life to get it back the little 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.689
 adventurer has allied with a daredevil 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.909
 world and already a strange nothing in the form of 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:29.829
 brush called the link as you can 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:31.149
 imagine the plot does not have a 

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:33.280
 great merit but it is the justification 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:35.350
 to put to roll again here and 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.600
 clear that at least in this sense 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.580
 the cinematics are so charismatic and 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.920
 striking that it is impossible not to want 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.959
 see them completely the buttons and sticks 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.030
 the gamepad are completely deactivated 

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:47.530
 throughout the odyssey to make way for a 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.659
 new game in which only 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.700
 we use the plump touch screen 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.349
 character of the inmate leaves behind is 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.000
 customary ability to obtain the 

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:56.560
 powers of the enemies that you eat for 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.179
 that we make it move by means of 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.009
 bright rainbow ribbons on the 

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:01.780
 scenarios first feels like a 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:04.119
 very simplified gameplay only that in 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.189
 reality is quite the opposite during your 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:07.509
 spherical shape can only attack 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:09.250
 the enemies with a kind of 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:11.470
 onslaught that we activate when pressed 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.239
 quickly twice also to the 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.630
 collect 100 stars within the 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:15.370
 levels 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.140
 we can make a major attack 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.450
 power that can tear down blocks of 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.910
 metal or false walls serves and follows these 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.680
 rainbow almost in magnetic form either 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.090
 that we do it prepares another height or 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.520
 spin around some obstacle 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.860
 we say almost instead of completely 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.540
 because sometimes the physics or that thickness 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.310
 excessive lines make kirby 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.350
 do not always follow the route that we have 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.540
 planned unlike its predecessor 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.490
 rainbow course is not so in tune 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.470
 this sense issue that forces to be 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.540
 more careful when exploring environments 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.610
 besides that it frustrates us constantly 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.770
 the amount of length of the lines 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.420
 that we can trace is not infinite like that 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:50.890
 that you always have to be very attentive to the 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.240
 meter that is on top of the 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.250
 screen with everything and we can 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.290
 delete them reach another line that 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.060
 crossing the meter he takes his time in 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.250
 filling up seems like a lie for this 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.440
 limiting that is usually annoying in this 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.910
 occasion adds a tremendous emotion and 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.280
 challenge to travel by zones 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.020
 dangerous the rainbows not only serve 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.820
 as paths to kirk bits but that 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.710
 They can also be used as barriers 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.750
 to protect it or even to dig and 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:16.000
 find paths hidden objects in the 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.920
 levels sometimes we end up using them 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.570
 for everything simultaneously with such 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.970
 try to survive the difficult 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.010
 last scenarios 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.930
 as for the enemies we face 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.250
 they are not exactly as varied or 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.740
 challenging as we would have expected 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.390
 good except for the fearsome and cursed 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.280
 ghosts that eliminate you from a single 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.290
 touch those who roam only for a 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.820
 particular scenario hopefully so of 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:37.920
 memorable were the bosses that we 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.020
 wait at the end of each piece of furniture but they are 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.030
 quite the opposite that they even end 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.130
 repeating shamelessly with one or 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.840
 two attacks something different as yes 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.850
 fight with the poor we speak boots in 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.530
 double chance was really necessary 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.060
 giving a little variety to the 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.560
 missions that are offered in history 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.000
 there are levels where we are 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.090
 transformed into different vehicles 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.040
 like a rocket a tank or a submarine 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.020
 each one has its own system of 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.880
 control and attack are unique movements 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.950
 The vast majority are pretty 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.110
 entertained with environments designed to 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.000
 break the tedium and give a twist to the rhythm 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.650
 of the game since it's not for nothing but 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.480
 some environments feel refilled 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.459
 with parts without much joke that the 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.480
 they make longer than they should in 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.549
 yes i come 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.560
 it's not exactly long because 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.630
 just cancel a little over 25 levels 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.979
 which adds value to 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.050
 play it again once it 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:27.000
 we finish are the additional challenges that 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.889
 are included as the one trying to get the 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.660
 more stars to win 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:32.520
 to collect gold medals 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.560
 all the collectibles hidden in 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.240
 the worlds besides the players that 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.250
 want to test their ability with 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.169
 the stylus will be able to do it in the tests 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.760
 short of the challenges modality the 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:43.680
 collectibles are composed of 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.720
 trophies of the characters made of 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.789
 plasticine songs to listen to on the 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.770
 audio section and curious pages for 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:52.110
 his diary and probably only the 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.240
 most diehard kirby fans will appreciate 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.070
 truly these detailed extras 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.350
 that we remember a great part 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:00.060
 of the characters or songs that have 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:01.979
 appeared in the saga the option 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.780
 multiplayer gives us the possibility of 

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:05.580
 that up to four simultaneous players 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:08.039
 enjoy the adventure the 3 players 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.229
 additional controls to guadalix de 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:11.610
 different color armed with a useful 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:13.889
 throw to eliminate enemies 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.960
 besides that they can make several 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:18.000
 jumps in the air and load to Kirby to 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.710
 protect it by playing this way it 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.510
 makes it easy to pick up the 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.700
 hidden collectibles 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:25.110
 when four players participate almost 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.180
 all missions become too 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:29.250
 easy since who controls the 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.600
 comelón inhabitant of betting will only 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.910
 to stay away from danger 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.440
 while every water where he does his work 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.240
 even these beings are not so 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.220
 relevant to the game counting on 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.170
 unlimited lives and being at the mercy of 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.730
 that the screen follow only kirby 

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:43.680
 pity that to take advantage of this 

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:45.540
 dynamic has not integrated environments 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.880
 specials with exclusive challenges from him 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.680
 once again nintendo manages to 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.570
 surprise us visually with a game 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.610
 for a console of lesser power than its 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:55.860
 current competitors the style of 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:57.270
 Plasticine on screen is vibrant and still 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:59.190
 best animation quality 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:01.020
 used the action does not run at 60 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:03.180
 frames per second but do not get confused 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:04.350
 this is completely intentional to 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:06.360
 that resembles a movie 

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:08.430
 stop-motion pity that like that 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.810
 the gameplay is almost impossible to 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:11.550
 contemplate it on the screen of 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:13.530
 TV to be attentive to everything 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.450
 moment the gamepad not only looks very 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:17.520
 well but it sounds amazing the 

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:19.080
 soundtrack is formed in part by 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.580
 an ample amount of melodies of 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.340
 many series games including 

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:25.590
 original classics of kill bill 64 of 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:26.129
 crystal sharp or revered super star 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:27.719
 all 

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:29.639
 with different arrangements that sound 

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:30.959
 great, mostly inclusive 

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:32.759
 many of the composite pieces 

00:06:30.959 --> 00:06:34.709
 originally for this new chapter 

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:37.229
 they are extraordinary like the amazing 

00:06:34.709 --> 00:06:39.300
 theme called butt lahm batum grass 

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:41.789
 under game world wars is much more than 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:43.709
 Tenderness the lines and rainbow is a 

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:45.539
 Challenging adventure that shows us 

00:06:43.709 --> 00:06:47.369
 new account that simplicity is not 

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:49.319
 fought with the quality our trip to
