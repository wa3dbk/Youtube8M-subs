legitimate oh 10 block if you can see
that<00:00:37.110> there<00:00:38.660> it's<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.750> 4<00:00:40.500> bolt<00:00:40.739> main<00:00:41.600> this<00:00:42.600> is

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
that there it's a 4 bolt main this is

the pretty popular block made from the

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
late 60s through the late 70s I thought

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.049 
late 60s through the late 70s I thought
they<00:00:52.680> were<00:00:52.770> supposed<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.129> be<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.309> casting<00:00:53.850> date

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
they were supposed to be a casting date

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.680 
they were supposed to be a casting date
but<00:00:54.300> I<00:00:54.570> found<00:00:54.930> this<00:00:56.030> section<00:00:57.030> here<00:00:57.360> is<00:00:57.420> the

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
but I found this section here is the

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.889 
but I found this section here is the
closest<00:00:58.649> thing<00:00:59.329> may<00:01:00.329> have<00:01:00.449> any<00:01:00.600> way<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:00.780> can

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
closest thing may have any way you can

closest thing may have any way you can
help<00:01:00.989> me<00:01:01.170> out<00:01:01.199> on<00:01:01.469> that<00:01:03.049> it's<00:01:04.049> been<00:01:04.290> bored<00:01:05.060> 30

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
help me out on that it's been bored 30

help me out on that it's been bored 30
over<00:01:06.479> at<00:01:07.229> some<00:01:07.530> point<00:01:08.689> the<00:01:09.689> cylinder<00:01:10.200> walls

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
over at some point the cylinder walls

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.160 
over at some point the cylinder walls
look<00:01:11.490> decent<00:01:11.700> there's<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.180> minor<00:01:12.600> amount<00:01:13.020> of

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
look decent there's a minor amount of

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.980 
look decent there's a minor amount of
scoring<00:01:14.450> but<00:01:15.450> that's<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:15.810> be<00:01:15.900> expected

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
scoring but that's to be expected

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.830 
scoring but that's to be expected
because<00:01:16.530> they<00:01:16.920> smooth<00:01:17.280> board<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.509> honed

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
because they smooth board it and honed

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.570 
because they smooth board it and honed
it<00:01:19.020> they<00:01:19.140> didn't<00:01:19.409> put<00:01:19.530> any<00:01:19.710> cross<00:01:19.950> hatching<00:01:20.430> in

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
it they didn't put any cross hatching in

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.660 
it they didn't put any cross hatching in
it<00:01:23.060> you<00:01:24.060> might<00:01:24.240> be<00:01:24.390> able<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.570> see<00:01:24.810> here<00:01:25.670> there

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
it you might be able to see here there

it you might be able to see here there
we<00:01:26.790> go<00:01:27.080> got<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.259> can<00:01:28.380> see<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.619> circles<00:01:29.009> and

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
we go got you can see the circles and

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.039 
we go got you can see the circles and
then<00:01:29.430> there's<00:01:30.150> some<00:01:30.390> slight<00:01:31.850> scoring

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
then there's some slight scoring

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:36.649 
then there's some slight scoring
vertically

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.289 

you<00:01:37.170> got<00:01:37.290> some<00:01:37.560> goodies<00:01:38.310> here<00:01:38.759> so<00:01:39.000> it's<00:01:39.180> not

you got some goodies here so it's not

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.330 
you got some goodies here so it's not

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
the smarter air engine that it used to

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.240 
the smarter air engine that it used to
be<00:01:42.110> Whelan<00:01:43.110> stealth<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.740> dual<00:01:43.920> plane<00:01:44.189> intake

manifold<00:01:45.439> we<00:01:46.439> got<00:01:46.590> some<00:01:46.920> no-name<00:01:48.200> long<00:01:49.200> tube

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
manifold we got some no-name long tube

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.770 
manifold we got some no-name long tube

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.779 
headers
they<00:01:52.259> bought<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.770> guy<00:01:52.979> that<00:01:53.220> was<00:01:53.340> running<00:01:53.520> him

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:53.789 
they bought a guy that was running him

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:57.350 
they bought a guy that was running him
in<00:01:53.909> uh<00:01:53.970> in<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:55.170> nova<00:01:55.890> they<00:01:56.220> were<00:01:56.280> made<00:01:56.549> for<00:01:56.789> 68<00:01:57.240> to

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
in uh in a nova they were made for 68 to

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.419 
in uh in a nova they were made for 68 to
70<00:01:57.689> for<00:01:57.899> Nova's<00:01:58.289> bottom<00:01:59.100> because<00:01:59.310> these

00:01:59.419 --> 00:01:59.429 
70 for Nova's bottom because these

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:01.520 
70 for Nova's bottom because these
actually<00:01:59.729> have<00:01:59.939> a<00:02:00.149> somewhat<00:02:00.780> thicker<00:02:01.049> flange

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
actually have a somewhat thicker flange

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.770 
actually have a somewhat thicker flange
that<00:02:01.710> doesn't<00:02:02.280> flex<00:02:02.579> so<00:02:02.939> hopefully<00:02:03.600> these

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
that doesn't flex so hopefully these

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.469 
that doesn't flex so hopefully these

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
guys won't leak when I get them on here

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.589
