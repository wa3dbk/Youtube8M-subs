outdoor<00:00:43.020> sections<00:00:43.730> it's<00:00:44.730> it's<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.300> little<00:00:45.570> tone

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
outdoor sections it's it's a little tone

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
outdoor sections it's it's a little tone
down<00:00:45.989> not<00:00:46.260> quite<00:00:46.590> as<00:00:47.930> technical<00:00:48.930> inside<00:00:49.590> the

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
down not quite as technical inside the

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.709 
down not quite as technical inside the
stadium<00:00:50.039> here<00:00:50.550> but<00:00:51.239> I<00:00:51.270> think<00:00:51.480> it's<00:00:51.570> going<00:00:51.660> to

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
stadium here but I think it's going to

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.920 
stadium here but I think it's going to
be<00:00:51.870> really<00:00:52.050> fun<00:00:52.640> racing<00:00:53.640> track<00:00:53.940> maybe<00:00:54.420> not<00:00:54.690> so

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
be really fun racing track maybe not so

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.990 
be really fun racing track maybe not so
one<00:00:55.170> lined<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:55.829> I<00:00:56.399> think<00:00:56.579> it's<00:00:56.699> going<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.850> be

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
one lined and I think it's going to be

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.299 
one lined and I think it's going to be
good<00:00:57.149> for<00:00:57.360> TV<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.379> fans<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.920> at<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.160> end

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
good for TV and the fans and at the end

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.860 
good for TV and the fans and at the end
of<00:00:59.399> the<00:00:59.460> day<00:00:59.609> that's<00:00:59.820> what<00:01:00.000> it<00:01:00.180> needs<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.449> be<00:01:00.690> I

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
of the day that's what it needs to be I

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.470 
of the day that's what it needs to be I
think<00:01:01.620> it's<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:02.760> million-dollar<00:01:03.090> purse

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
think it's the million-dollar purse

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.950 
think it's the million-dollar purse
opens<00:01:03.870> up<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.260> lot<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.939> avenues<00:01:06.240> for<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.659> future

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
opens up a lot of avenues for the future

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.539 
opens up a lot of avenues for the future
something<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:07.619> thought<00:01:07.799> was<00:01:07.950> pretty<00:01:08.040> cool<00:01:08.220> is

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
something I thought was pretty cool is

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.850 
something I thought was pretty cool is
obviously<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.060> whoop<00:01:09.570> section<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:10.140> you're<00:01:10.770> a

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
obviously the whoop section and you're a

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.679

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
cool for the fans and the racer in TV

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.130 
cool for the fans and the racer in TV
and<00:01:47.060> yeah<00:01:48.060> so<00:01:48.299> much<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:48.509> doesn't<00:01:48.750> even<00:01:48.960> have

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
and yeah so much that doesn't even have

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.780 
and yeah so much that doesn't even have
any<00:01:49.170> whoop<00:01:49.439> section<00:01:49.710> in<00:01:50.040> here<00:01:50.189> i'm<00:01:50.310> like<00:01:50.460> wow

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
any whoop section in here i'm like wow

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.389 
any whoop section in here i'm like wow
it<00:01:51.210> doesn't<00:01:51.659> so<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:52.079> started<00:01:52.920> looking<00:01:52.979> at<00:01:53.369> it

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
it doesn't so I started looking at it

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.370 
it doesn't so I started looking at it
and<00:01:53.549> just<00:01:53.700> like<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:53.880> said<00:01:54.210> it<00:01:54.450> I<00:01:54.810> don't<00:01:55.110> think

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
and just like you said it I don't think

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.810 
and just like you said it I don't think
that<00:01:55.439> there<00:01:55.680> needs<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:55.979> be<00:01:56.040> an<00:01:56.189> element<00:01:56.369> out

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
that there needs to be an element out

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.120 
that there needs to be an element out
there<00:01:57.090> to<00:01:57.420> where<00:01:57.659> you<00:01:58.320> know<00:01:58.469> someone's<00:01:58.920> going

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
there to where you know someone's going

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.899 
there to where you know someone's going
to<00:01:59.159> get<00:01:59.280> hurt<00:01:59.340> or<00:01:59.909> it<00:02:00.780> is<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.560> decision<00:02:02.399> maker<00:02:02.640> I

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
to get hurt or it is a decision maker I

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.120 
to get hurt or it is a decision maker I
think<00:02:03.540> this<00:02:03.689> is<00:02:03.840> a<00:02:03.869> racetrack<00:02:04.290> where<00:02:04.770> they<00:02:04.890> can

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
think this is a racetrack where they can

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.340 
think this is a racetrack where they can
worry<00:02:05.549> about<00:02:05.670> racing<00:02:06.390> they<00:02:06.899> don't<00:02:07.110> have<00:02:07.200> to

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
worry about racing they don't have to

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.710 
worry about racing they don't have to
worry<00:02:07.530> about<00:02:07.649> making<00:02:08.039> some<00:02:08.429> crazy<00:02:08.729> obstacle

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
worry about making some crazy obstacle

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.960 
worry about making some crazy obstacle
section<00:02:10.200> or<00:02:10.470> something<00:02:10.860> like<00:02:10.979> that

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
section or something like that

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.480 
section or something like that
I<00:02:12.030> think<00:02:12.600> when<00:02:12.810> when<00:02:13.350> you<00:02:13.530> see<00:02:13.800> that<00:02:14.040> happen

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
I think when when you see that happen

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.040 
I think when when you see that happen
and<00:02:14.640> they're<00:02:14.760> able<00:02:14.880> to<00:02:15.120> race<00:02:15.300> like<00:02:15.570> that<00:02:15.600> not

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
and they're able to race like that not

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.510 
and they're able to race like that not
have<00:02:16.260> something<00:02:16.650> in<00:02:16.740> the<00:02:16.830> back<00:02:17.010> of<00:02:17.160> their<00:02:17.250> mind

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
have something in the back of their mind

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.190 
have something in the back of their mind
I<00:02:17.820> think<00:02:18.240> is<00:02:18.330> just<00:02:18.360> going<00:02:18.570> to<00:02:18.660> produce<00:02:18.840> better

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
I think is just going to produce better

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.070 
I think is just going to produce better
racing<00:02:19.680> and<00:02:19.940> that's<00:02:20.940> that's<00:02:21.420> what<00:02:21.780> it's<00:02:21.930> all

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
racing and that's that's what it's all

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.110 
racing and that's that's what it's all
about
