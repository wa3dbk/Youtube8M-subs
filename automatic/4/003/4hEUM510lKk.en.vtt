 board operation on the share 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:18.869
 It's natural with the people they have 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.549
 preference, but then I realize that 's how it is 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.950

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.860
 really is second at night 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.869
 but they like it so much I had this part of 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.630
 keyboard and battery 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:34.680
 is this the correct way of organizing 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:37.530
 assembly mainly so I realize 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.440
 much this part of the staff to 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:44.869
