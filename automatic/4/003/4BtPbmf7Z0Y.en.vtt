00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
progression through the second camp well

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:05.720 
progression through the second camp well
I<00:00:04.500> think<00:00:04.589> I'm<00:00:04.830> definitely<00:00:05.009> playing<00:00:05.430> it<00:00:05.580> fast

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
I think I'm definitely playing it fast

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.340 
I think I'm definitely playing it fast
right<00:00:06.029> now<00:00:06.060> I<00:00:06.390> know<00:00:06.480> a<00:00:06.629> lot<00:00:06.720> more<00:00:06.870> the<00:00:07.140> players

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
right now I know a lot more the players

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.589 
right now I know a lot more the players
I<00:00:07.500> did<00:00:07.680> last<00:00:07.859> year<00:00:08.010> so<00:00:08.309> it<00:00:08.429> allows<00:00:08.730> me<00:00:08.760> to<00:00:09.059> not

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
I did last year so it allows me to not

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:10.910 
I did last year so it allows me to not
think<00:00:09.780> as<00:00:09.960> much<00:00:09.990> as<00:00:10.260> when<00:00:10.349> I'm<00:00:10.469> playing<00:00:10.590> and

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
think as much as when I'm playing and

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.740 
think as much as when I'm playing and
just<00:00:11.040> better<00:00:11.309> to<00:00:11.400> go<00:00:11.490> out<00:00:11.550> there<00:00:11.730> and<00:00:11.849> react<00:00:12.630> to

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
just better to go out there and react to

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.030 
just better to go out there and react to
things<00:00:12.870> instead<00:00:13.170> of<00:00:13.290> having<00:00:13.410> to<00:00:13.530> think<00:00:13.740> so<00:00:14.009> i

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
things instead of having to think so i

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:14.900 
things instead of having to think so i
think<00:00:14.130> i'm<00:00:14.340> getting<00:00:14.429> better<00:00:14.580> than<00:00:14.820> that

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
think i'm getting better than that

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.180 
think i'm getting better than that
aspect<00:00:15.389> i'm<00:00:15.990> a<00:00:16.049> little<00:00:16.289> bit<00:00:16.470> stronger<00:00:16.800> than<00:00:17.070> I

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
aspect i'm a little bit stronger than I

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.830 
aspect i'm a little bit stronger than I
was<00:00:17.220> last<00:00:17.520> year<00:00:17.699> also<00:00:17.910> so<00:00:18.240> that's<00:00:18.390> helping<00:00:18.539> me

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
was last year also so that's helping me

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.439 
was last year also so that's helping me
in<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.350> blocking<00:00:19.859> game<00:00:20.189> think<00:00:20.970> I'm<00:00:21.029> just<00:00:21.210> more

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
in the blocking game think I'm just more

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.000 
in the blocking game think I'm just more
as<00:00:21.720> overall<00:00:22.109> Afghans<00:00:22.500> a<00:00:22.619> little<00:00:22.769> bit<00:00:22.859> more

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
as overall Afghans a little bit more

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:31.510 
as overall Afghans a little bit more
mature<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:23.820> develop<00:00:23.880> so<00:00:24.359> that's<00:00:24.510> helping<00:00:24.630> me

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.799 

it's<00:00:32.520> not<00:00:32.669> really<00:00:32.820> one<00:00:33.030> specific<00:00:33.480> thing<00:00:33.510> I

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
it's not really one specific thing I

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.630 
it's not really one specific thing I
just<00:00:34.050> just<00:00:34.710> being<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.070> better<00:00:35.280> all-around

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
just just being a better all-around

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.420 
just just being a better all-around
player<00:00:36.120> honest<00:00:36.480> and<00:00:36.660> just<00:00:36.840> uh<00:00:36.989> just<00:00:37.430> being

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
player honest and just uh just being

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.799 
player honest and just uh just being
more<00:00:38.579> mature<00:00:38.760> player<00:00:39.180> I<00:00:39.239> guess<00:00:39.270> it's<00:00:39.600> kind<00:00:39.780> of

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
more mature player I guess it's kind of

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.119 
more mature player I guess it's kind of
understanding<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.320> game<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.559> little<00:00:40.739> bit<00:00:40.829> more

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
understanding the game a little bit more

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.700 
understanding the game a little bit more
and<00:00:41.340> understand<00:00:41.790> what<00:00:41.910> it<00:00:42.000> has<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.149> take<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.629> a

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
and understand what it has to take to a

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.410 
and understand what it has to take to a
compete<00:00:43.710> at<00:00:43.800> this<00:00:43.890> level<00:00:46.969> like<00:00:47.969> you<00:00:48.149> can<00:00:48.329> learn

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
compete at this level like you can learn

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.790 
compete at this level like you can learn
the<00:00:48.480> PlayBook<00:00:48.930> easy<00:00:49.140> but<00:00:49.379> then<00:00:49.500> when<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:49.649> get

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
the PlayBook easy but then when you get

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.799 
the PlayBook easy but then when you get
out<00:00:49.950> there<00:00:50.160> and<00:00:50.340> we<00:00:50.489> run<00:00:50.700> it<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:51.000> fast<00:00:51.270> then

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
out there and we run it that fast then

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.180 
out there and we run it that fast then
you<00:00:51.840> just<00:00:52.170> like<00:00:52.320> almost<00:00:52.590> forget<00:00:52.890> everything

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
you just like almost forget everything

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.709 
you just like almost forget everything
you<00:00:53.280> knew<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:53.879> kind<00:00:54.090> of<00:00:54.149> freeze<00:00:54.449> up<00:00:54.629> a

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
you knew and you kind of freeze up a

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.270 
you knew and you kind of freeze up a
little<00:00:54.870> bit<00:00:54.960> so<00:00:55.110> it's<00:00:55.230> like<00:00:55.350> I<00:00:55.590> picked<00:00:56.219> the

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
little bit so it's like I picked the

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.709 
little bit so it's like I picked the
playbook<00:00:56.670> up<00:00:56.820> just<00:00:57.059> some<00:00:57.210> X's<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.570> O's

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
playbook up just some X's and O's

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.450 
playbook up just some X's and O's
standpoint<00:00:58.020> but<00:00:58.379> then<00:00:58.590> when<00:00:59.129> you<00:00:59.190> get<00:00:59.309> out

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
standpoint but then when you get out

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.560 
standpoint but then when you get out
there<00:00:59.670> and<00:00:59.760> now<00:00:59.879> you<00:00:59.940> have<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.149> run<00:01:00.270> three

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
there and now you have to run three

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.180 
there and now you have to run three
players<00:01:00.809> and<00:01:01.050> no<00:01:01.320> minute<00:01:01.649> then<00:01:01.829> yours<00:01:02.039> like

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
players and no minute then yours like

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.650 
players and no minute then yours like
your<00:01:02.670> head<00:01:02.789> starts<00:01:03.059> spinning<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.329> little<00:01:03.359> bit

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
your head starts spinning a little bit

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.570 
your head starts spinning a little bit
so<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.439> game<00:01:04.589> was<00:01:04.739> slowing<00:01:04.949> down<00:01:05.070> definitely

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
so the game was slowing down definitely

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.730 
so the game was slowing down definitely
this<00:01:05.729> year<00:01:05.880> for<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.090> little<00:01:06.330> bit<00:01:09.439> wide<00:01:10.439> receiver

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
this year for a little bit wide receiver

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.490 
this year for a little bit wide receiver
position<00:01:10.909> that's<00:01:11.909> an<00:01:12.000> opportunity<00:01:12.500> it

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
position that's an opportunity it

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.810 
position that's an opportunity it
definitely<00:01:13.770> is<00:01:13.950> this<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.130> chance<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.520> compete

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
definitely is this a chance to compete

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.850 
definitely is this a chance to compete
there's<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.240> lot<00:01:15.840> of<00:01:15.869> guys<00:01:16.080> on<00:01:16.259> competing<00:01:16.590> with

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
there's a lot of guys on competing with

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.850 
there's a lot of guys on competing with
and<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.640> think<00:01:18.299> we're<00:01:19.049> doing<00:01:19.170> are<00:01:19.409> doing<00:01:19.830> pretty

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
and I think we're doing are doing pretty

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.590 
and I think we're doing are doing pretty
good<00:01:20.220> trying<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.610> know<00:01:20.939> Anderson<00:01:21.180> Matthews

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
good trying to know Anderson Matthews

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.940 
good trying to know Anderson Matthews
because<00:01:21.810> I'm<00:01:21.900> players<00:01:22.080> out<00:01:22.290> of<00:01:22.320> there<00:01:22.560> and

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
because I'm players out of there and

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.469 
because I'm players out of there and
think<00:01:23.729> we're<00:01:23.820> doing<00:01:23.939> pretty<00:01:24.030> good<00:01:24.270> job<00:01:24.420> of

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
think we're doing pretty good job of

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.170 
think we're doing pretty good job of
this<00:01:24.659> can

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.030 

oh<00:01:29.240> I<00:01:29.990> mean<00:01:30.370> I<00:01:31.370> want<00:01:31.940> to<00:01:32.000> say<00:01:32.090> no<00:01:32.300> but<00:01:32.380> I<00:01:33.380> think

oh I mean I want to say no but I think

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.650 
oh I mean I want to say no but I think
I've<00:01:34.130> been<00:01:34.280> working<00:01:34.550> pretty<00:01:34.670> hard<00:01:34.790> and<00:01:35.270> so

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:35.660 
I've been working pretty hard and so

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.810 
I've been working pretty hard and so
whatever<00:01:36.650> playing<00:01:36.920> time<00:01:37.100> I<00:01:37.130> do<00:01:37.310> get<00:01:37.580> I

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
whatever playing time I do get I

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.530 
whatever playing time I do get I
deserved<00:01:38.390> that<00:01:38.510> so<00:01:38.960> that's<00:01:39.350> the<00:01:40.540> death

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
deserved that so that's the death

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.360 
deserved that so that's the death
downfield<00:01:42.320> blocking<00:01:42.500> if<00:01:43.040> your<00:01:43.190> wide

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:43.370 
downfield blocking if your wide

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.250
