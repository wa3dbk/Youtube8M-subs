00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.520 
there's a lot of bonding agents you
could<00:00:37.739> use<00:00:37.920> or<00:00:38.070> liquid<00:00:38.370> lath<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:39.290> I'm<00:00:40.290> just

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
could use or liquid lath and I'm just

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.110 
could use or liquid lath and I'm just
using<00:00:40.710> this<00:00:40.920> clear<00:00:41.250> one<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:41.520> put<00:00:41.700> this<00:00:41.850> clear

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
stuff on you can't even see its own good

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
I'll take some cement Tisha's finish and

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.479 
I'll take some cement Tisha's finish and
a<00:00:51.449> couple<00:00:52.170> ways<00:00:52.260> you<00:00:52.440> guys<00:00:52.620> can<00:00:52.829> do<00:00:52.980> this<00:00:53.010> just

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
to prove a point since you're on that

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.180 
to prove a point since you're on that
side<00:00:56.190> see<00:00:56.760> all<00:00:56.879> these<00:00:57.590> gaps<00:00:58.590> in<00:00:58.829> here<00:00:59.010> I'm<00:00:59.129> just

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
side see all these gaps in here I'm just

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.639 
side see all these gaps in here I'm just
gonna<00:00:59.370> feel<00:00:59.609> I<00:00:59.670> could<00:00:59.820> skim<00:01:00.270> it<00:01:00.390> real<00:01:01.379> quick

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
gonna feel I could skim it real quick

gonna feel I could skim it real quick
I'll<00:01:01.890> show<00:01:02.100> you<00:01:02.190> both<00:01:02.340> ways<00:01:02.399> or<00:01:03.090> I<00:01:03.149> can<00:01:03.510> just

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:05.090 
I'll show you both ways or I can just

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.420 
I'll show you both ways or I can just
pass<00:01:06.090> in<00:01:06.299> these<00:01:06.450> gaps<00:01:06.720> here<00:01:07.080> where<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.189> Skip

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
pass in these gaps here where the Skip

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.640 
pass in these gaps here where the Skip
trial<00:01:08.729> is<00:01:10.130> they<00:01:11.780> not<00:01:12.780> even<00:01:12.900> sure<00:01:13.200> certain

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
trial is they not even sure certain

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.560 
trial is they not even sure certain
myself<00:01:14.010> which<00:01:14.189> way<00:01:14.369> is<00:01:14.520> faster<00:01:14.729> I'm<00:01:15.240> gonna<00:01:15.390> hit

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
myself which way is faster I'm gonna hit

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.789 
myself which way is faster I'm gonna hit
them<00:01:15.630> both<00:01:15.810> ways<00:01:16.080> okay<00:01:17.060> we<00:01:18.060> fill<00:01:18.659> this<00:01:18.780> in<00:01:19.049> all

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
them both ways okay we fill this in all

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.140 
them both ways okay we fill this in all
we're<00:01:20.009> doing<00:01:20.280> is<00:01:20.369> we're<00:01:20.580> filling<00:01:20.909> in<00:01:21.000> the

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
we're doing is we're filling in the

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.249 
we're doing is we're filling in the
areas<00:01:21.509> that<00:01:21.540> have<00:01:23.330> too<00:01:24.330> much<00:01:24.479> of<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.750> skip<00:01:24.990> trial

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
areas that have too much of a skip trial

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.890 
areas that have too much of a skip trial
finishing<00:01:25.860> not<00:01:26.070> enough<00:01:26.430> of<00:01:26.670> what<00:01:27.390> they<00:01:27.630> have

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
finishing not enough of what they have

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.319 
finishing not enough of what they have
here<00:01:28.320> they<00:01:28.729> originally<00:01:29.729> could<00:01:29.880> have<00:01:29.970> started

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
here they originally could have started

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.039 
here they originally could have started
are<00:01:30.479> something<00:01:31.439> similar<00:01:31.950> like<00:01:32.189> this<00:01:32.430> but

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
are something similar like this but

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:37.700 
are something similar like this but
after<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.850> hundred<00:01:35.850> years<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.509> many<00:01:37.470> many

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
after a hundred years and many many

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.289 
after a hundred years and many many
paint<00:01:38.009> jobs<00:01:38.310> later<00:01:38.960> they<00:01:39.960> are<00:01:40.700> too<00:01:41.700> soft

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
paint jobs later they are too soft

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.510 
paint jobs later they are too soft
this<00:01:42.450> one's<00:01:42.689> just<00:01:42.990> too<00:01:43.590> textured<00:01:44.159> now<00:01:44.280> I<00:01:44.310> can

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
this one's just too textured now I can

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.859 
this one's just too textured now I can
do<00:01:44.610> that<00:01:44.820> or<00:01:45.149> I<00:01:45.210> can<00:01:45.390> come<00:01:45.570> over<00:01:45.810> here<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.229> just

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
do that or I can come over here and just

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:51.679 
do that or I can come over here and just
put<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.020> little<00:01:49.079> heavier<00:01:50.299> and<00:01:51.299> cover<00:01:51.570> a

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
put it a little heavier and cover a

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.580 
put it a little heavier and cover a
little<00:01:51.899> bit<00:01:51.990> more<00:01:52.229> because<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.460> is<00:01:53.490> an<00:01:53.880> Adobe

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
little bit more because it is an Adobe

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.139 
little bit more because it is an Adobe
talked<00:01:55.590> about<00:01:55.799> Adobe<00:01:56.070> finishes<00:01:56.759> is<00:01:56.939> they're

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
talked about Adobe finishes is they're

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:03.750 
talked about Adobe finishes is they're
very<00:01:57.390> forgiving

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.510 

here<00:02:05.350> lastly<00:02:06.350> we're<00:02:06.620> gonna<00:02:06.710> soften<00:02:07.070> up<00:02:07.340> these

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
here lastly we're gonna soften up these

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.330 
here lastly we're gonna soften up these
edges<00:02:08.090> soften<00:02:08.720> up<00:02:08.840> that<00:02:09.080> and<00:02:09.830> get<00:02:09.979> rid<00:02:10.010> of<00:02:10.160> that

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
edges soften up that and get rid of that

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:17.080 
edges soften up that and get rid of that
okay<00:02:11.000> now<00:02:13.810> what<00:02:14.810> I<00:02:14.840> would<00:02:15.110> do<00:02:15.320> is<00:02:15.970> there's<00:02:16.970> just

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
okay now what I would do is there's just

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.080 
okay now what I would do is there's just
a<00:02:17.270> little<00:02:17.480> spot<00:02:17.720> right<00:02:17.960> here

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
a little spot right here

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.670 
a little spot right here
after<00:02:20.090> you've<00:02:20.210> got<00:02:20.360> got<00:02:20.870> it<00:02:21.020> built<00:02:21.260> out<00:02:21.440> and

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
after you've got got it built out and

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.730 
after you've got got it built out and
smooth<00:02:22.160> down<00:02:22.430> a<00:02:22.490> bit<00:02:22.880> then<00:02:23.630> you<00:02:23.750> take<00:02:23.960> a<00:02:23.990> green

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
smooth down a bit then you take a green

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.180 
smooth down a bit then you take a green
sponge<00:02:25.130> float<00:02:25.460> with<00:02:25.670> water<00:02:26.150> on<00:02:26.420> it<00:02:26.980> like<00:02:27.980> at

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
sponge float with water on it like at

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.640 
sponge float with water on it like at
this<00:02:28.370> you<00:02:28.580> see<00:02:28.730> that<00:02:28.880> water<00:02:29.120> there<00:02:29.420> okay<00:02:30.200> now

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
this you see that water there okay now

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.230 
this you see that water there okay now
we<00:02:30.710> look<00:02:30.920> at<00:02:31.040> this<00:02:31.250> and<00:02:31.580> since<00:02:31.760> the<00:02:31.880> cameras

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
we look at this and since the cameras

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.920 
we look at this and since the cameras
right<00:02:32.420> here

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
right here

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.290 
right here
I'll<00:02:33.530> just<00:02:33.770> feather<00:02:34.280> this<00:02:34.550> in<00:02:34.790> and<00:02:35.180> I'm<00:02:35.270> just

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
I'll just feather this in and I'm just

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.540 
I'll just feather this in and I'm just
gonna<00:02:35.510> go<00:02:35.720> in<00:02:35.840> circles<00:02:36.170> all<00:02:37.040> I<00:02:37.070> want<00:02:37.340> to<00:02:37.430> do

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
gonna go in circles all I want to do

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.850 
gonna go in circles all I want to do
guys<00:02:37.760> is<00:02:37.790> soften<00:02:38.540> this<00:02:38.660> up<00:02:38.840> a<00:02:38.960> little<00:02:39.140> bit<00:02:39.320> if

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
guys is soften this up a little bit if

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.980 
guys is soften this up a little bit if
it<00:02:39.980> softened<00:02:40.430> up<00:02:40.580> a<00:02:40.700> little<00:02:40.880> bit<00:02:41.060> then<00:02:41.780> it'll

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
it softened up a little bit then it'll

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.430 
it softened up a little bit then it'll
match<00:02:42.200> what<00:02:42.710> they<00:02:42.860> have<00:02:43.130> much<00:02:44.060> better<00:02:44.510> it's

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
match what they have much better it's

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.330 
match what they have much better it's
the<00:02:45.560> equivalent<00:02:45.890> to<00:02:46.310> Oh<00:02:47.800> 1020<00:02:48.800> coats<00:02:49.010> of<00:02:49.130> paint

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
the equivalent to Oh 1020 coats of paint

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.370 
the equivalent to Oh 1020 coats of paint
this<00:02:50.150> is<00:02:50.330> just<00:02:50.540> a<00:02:50.600> lot<00:02:50.720> faster<00:02:51.640> so<00:02:53.230> take<00:02:54.230> it

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
this is just a lot faster so take it

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.700 
this is just a lot faster so take it
there<00:02:54.700> and<00:02:55.700> when<00:02:56.000> this<00:02:56.210> this<00:02:57.110> sponge<00:02:57.440> float

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:57.710 
there and when this this sponge float

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.370 
there and when this this sponge float
starts<00:02:58.130> to<00:02:58.340> drag<00:02:58.670> that<00:02:59.390> means<00:02:59.630> it's<00:02:59.840> got<00:03:00.020> too

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
starts to drag that means it's got too

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.480 
starts to drag that means it's got too
much<00:03:00.790> cement<00:03:01.790> on<00:03:02.060> it<00:03:02.330> and<00:03:02.720> not<00:03:03.020> enough<00:03:03.380> you<00:03:04.340> got

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:04.490 
much cement on it and not enough you got

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.310 
much cement on it and not enough you got
to<00:03:04.580> clean<00:03:04.760> it<00:03:04.880> not<00:03:05.030> enough<00:03:05.300> water<00:03:05.540> so<00:03:05.989> it's

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
to clean it not enough water so it's

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.470 
to clean it not enough water so it's
starting<00:03:06.709> to<00:03:06.770> drag<00:03:07.010> right<00:03:07.280> now<00:03:07.430> I<00:03:07.670> got<00:03:08.270> one

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
starting to drag right now I got one

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.180 
starting to drag right now I got one
whole<00:03:08.660> side<00:03:08.959> of<00:03:08.989> that<00:03:09.230> pillar<00:03:09.470> you<00:03:09.739> know<00:03:09.980> what

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
whole side of that pillar you know what

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.520 
whole side of that pillar you know what
that's<00:03:10.430> good<00:03:10.640> enough<00:03:10.730> so<00:03:11.480> what<00:03:11.570> I<00:03:11.630> do<00:03:11.750> now

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
that's good enough so what I do now

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.340 
that's good enough so what I do now
notice<00:03:12.890> how<00:03:13.010> soft<00:03:13.370> and<00:03:13.580> that<00:03:13.730> is<00:03:13.880> now<00:03:14.180> that<00:03:15.080> is

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
notice how soft and that is now that is

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.150 
notice how soft and that is now that is
pretty<00:03:15.980> much<00:03:16.190> well<00:03:16.850> it's<00:03:16.940> a<00:03:17.000> lot<00:03:17.120> closer<00:03:17.420> than

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
pretty much well it's a lot closer than

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.440 
pretty much well it's a lot closer than
what<00:03:19.160> was<00:03:19.370> there<00:03:19.670> it's<00:03:19.790> on<00:03:19.910> the<00:03:20.060> money<00:03:20.180> almost

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
what was there it's on the money almost

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.180 
what was there it's on the money almost
to<00:03:20.780> what<00:03:20.900> they<00:03:21.050> have<00:03:21.230> because<00:03:21.620> they<00:03:21.650> did<00:03:21.980> use

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
to what they have because they did use

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.670 
to what they have because they did use
the<00:03:22.340> float<00:03:22.750> okay<00:03:23.750> so<00:03:24.050> I'm<00:03:24.140> gonna<00:03:24.260> clean<00:03:24.530> my

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
the float okay so I'm gonna clean my

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.750 
the float okay so I'm gonna clean my
float<00:03:24.950> one<00:03:25.100> more<00:03:25.280> time

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
float one more time

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.330 
float one more time
get<00:03:25.970> all<00:03:26.239> of<00:03:26.510> that<00:03:26.540> Portland<00:03:27.200> cement<00:03:27.560> off<00:03:28.070> of

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
get all of that Portland cement off of

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.140 
get all of that Portland cement off of
there<00:03:30.130> okay<00:03:31.130> and<00:03:31.310> now<00:03:31.580> I'm<00:03:31.640> gonna<00:03:31.730> hit<00:03:31.970> this

there okay and now I'm gonna hit this

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.660 
there okay and now I'm gonna hit this
side<00:03:32.390> right<00:03:32.600> here<00:03:32.840> and<00:03:32.959> again<00:03:33.200> I<00:03:33.500> want<00:03:34.400> to<00:03:34.459> just

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
side right here and again I want to just

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.860 
side right here and again I want to just
soften<00:03:34.940> the<00:03:35.239> look<00:03:35.390> so<00:03:35.900> I<00:03:36.610> know<00:03:37.750> where<00:03:38.750> the

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
soften the look so I know where the

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.660 
soften the look so I know where the
water<00:03:39.080> is<00:03:39.200> on<00:03:39.500> this<00:03:39.620> float<00:03:39.890> as<00:03:40.130> you<00:03:40.310> see<00:03:40.489> me

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
water is on this float as you see me

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.060 
water is on this float as you see me
just<00:03:40.910> turn<00:03:41.150> it<00:03:41.360> because<00:03:42.200> I<00:03:42.500> don't<00:03:42.890> want<00:03:43.010> to

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:43.070 
just turn it because I don't want to

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.340 
just turn it because I don't want to
start<00:03:43.220> dripping<00:03:43.459> all<00:03:43.700> over<00:03:43.730> the<00:03:44.030> play<00:03:44.350> this

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
start dripping all over the play this

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.380 
start dripping all over the play this
this<00:03:45.680> part<00:03:46.010> right<00:03:46.160> here<00:03:46.220> makes<00:03:47.030> a<00:03:47.120> little<00:03:47.269> bit

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
this part right here makes a little bit

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
this part right here makes a little bit
of<00:03:47.540> practice<00:03:47.720> guys<00:03:49.750> we<00:03:50.750> make<00:03:50.930> it<00:03:51.080> look<00:03:51.260> easy

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
of practice guys we make it look easy

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:52.810 
of practice guys we make it look easy
and<00:03:51.709> we're<00:03:51.800> supposed<00:03:52.070> to<00:03:52.220> make<00:03:52.370> it<00:03:52.519> look<00:03:52.640> easy

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820 
and we're supposed to make it look easy

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.720 
and we're supposed to make it look easy
because<00:03:53.090> this<00:03:53.450> is<00:03:53.600> what<00:03:53.780> I<00:03:53.810> do<00:03:53.930> for<00:03:54.260> a<00:03:54.320> living

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730

there's a reason I don't show how to fix

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.490 
there's a reason I don't show how to fix
plumbing<00:03:58.250> or<00:03:58.340> electricity<00:03:58.780> that<00:03:59.780> reason<00:04:00.170> is<00:04:00.290> I

much softer now and this will adhere

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.630 
much softer now and this will adhere
forever<00:04:14.140> because<00:04:14.680> we<00:04:14.830> do<00:04:15.010> have<00:04:15.160> that<00:04:15.370> liquid

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640
