00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:07.450
 greetings and welcome to your channel 

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:07.450
 reading dimension nuance 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.390
 any 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.290
 women and children 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.710
 hello people, the girl who greets them 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.260
 comes from the neptune dimension in this 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.270
 occasion with a well-known game 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.480
 but maybe not all have been able 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.730
 play as this version so I know 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.730
 it was only available for the already 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.680
 deceased game cube the title that is 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.710
 gave this game was nothing more or nothing 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:58.309
 less than 'resident evil' remake game 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.890
 that was launched in 2002 as well as what 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:03.260
 says his name is the remake of the first 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:07.580
 game of this saga that was available 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:10.640
 the year 1996 with similar graphics 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.160
 to minecraft lol the game itself is a 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.340
 emulated version for the pc and it comes 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.550
 completely dubbed into Spanish so no 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.990
 they will need emulators or patches 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.850
 they just have to download it from 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.310
 the links that I left in the 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.830
 description of the video and install it as 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.380
 any other program can 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.630
 customize the graphs and controls to 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:36.940
 their taste so they should not have 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.940
 problems to play it at ease 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:46.360
 this improved version brings us back 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.369
 at the beginning of the saga is to say the 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.500
 spencer mansion built by the 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.530
 architect your trevor in the forest of 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.630
 the mountains to clay the setting of the 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.970
 game is relatively good in my 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.220
 opinion since it always keeps you in 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.830
 suspense and most of the time 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.170
 you try to solve a puzzle the 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.509
 things will get more and more complicated 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.270
 one way or another the system of 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:12.970
 combat is pretty easy since you can 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.830
 avoid direct confrontations for 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.250
 sneak away without spending 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.680
 ammo remember this if it's a game 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.440
 of survival horror so you must be very 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.480
 selective when it comes to using your weapons and 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.780
 that ammunition in this kind of games 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.600
 it's sacred so much that you even have 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.850
 a limit of 6 points to save now 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.790
 that you need ink to write and 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.920
 save your advances in the game in my 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.290
 case when I started playing it for 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.180
 the first time I kept and even 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.940
 I was trying to kill all the enemies 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.660
 possible which in just half an hour 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.910
 of game 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.430
 I had already lost almost all the ammunition 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.740
 inks and items to recover life 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:57.160
 that by obligation I had to start everything 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:59.890
 again lol in my opinion this game 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.470
 together with the resident evil zero are the 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.600
 best not to say are the only ones 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.630
 they cling to the genre by which they are 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.850
 He met this saga I personally have 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.370
 seen and sometimes I played the 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.500
 last 'resident evil' and the truth for 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.780
 I'm just generic shooters the 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.360
 which have lost all the essence of 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.090
 terror that both these games caused 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.460
 in its beginnings although the story is 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:27.030
 something difficult to understand because 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:29.920
 the texts in which they explain the 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.350
 events is so different order and 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.930
 are found in different stages of 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.030
 the mansion some scenes of the game 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.610
 they really do not have an explanation 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.700
 logic and the enemies tend to 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.740
 reappear after a certain time 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.930
 Of course there are ways to avoid it but 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:49.720
 I'm trying not to spoil you read the 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:52.920
 game at all hahaha if I suffered or 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:56.250
 rather I still suffer for this game 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:59.250
 and I have not finished it but you do not deserve 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:02.459
 that's why I'm still too young to be 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:05.130
 traumatized with this kind of thing that 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:07.590
 although I do not like them anyway 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:10.530
 I still play them and tried to finish 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:13.170
 the lol finally hope you enjoy the 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:16.230
 game since with the recent departure of 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:19.079
 Resident Evil 6 Many are just getting 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:21.389
 knowing about the saga so better than 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:23.280
 start at the place where I start 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:27.190
 everything and that has marked a milestone in the 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:29.710
 history of horror video games 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:33.090
 thank you very much for your attention we 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.090
 we will see later bye
