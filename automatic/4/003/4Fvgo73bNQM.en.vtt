you did that so there you go you have a
3x3<00:01:53.369> square<00:01:53.840> which<00:01:54.840> is<00:01:54.869> 2<00:01:55.470> plates<00:01:55.950> hi<00:01:56.130> next

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
3x3 square which is 2 plates hi next

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.999 
3x3 square which is 2 plates hi next
what<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.180> do<00:01:57.299> is<00:01:57.810> you<00:01:57.899> take<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.350> array<00:01:58.649> starts

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
what you do is you take the array starts

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.920 
what you do is you take the array starts
and<00:01:59.549> you<00:01:59.700> have<00:01:59.790> to<00:01:59.969> put<00:02:00.149> them<00:02:00.270> in<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.509> corners
