00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
turn it off because you want to make

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.200 
turn it off because you want to make

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
sure that there isn't anything moving

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.169 
sure that there isn't anything moving
and<00:02:06.630> you<00:02:06.719> can<00:02:06.869> see<00:02:07.079> I<00:02:07.320> have<00:02:07.439> a<00:02:07.619> pretty<00:02:08.220> pretty

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
and you can see I have a pretty pretty

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.170 
and you can see I have a pretty pretty
clean<00:02:09.509> screen<00:02:10.259> at<00:02:10.470> this<00:02:10.590> point<00:02:10.860> so<00:02:11.550> just<00:02:12.000> do<00:02:12.090> it

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
clean screen at this point so just do it

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.490 
clean screen at this point so just do it
one<00:02:12.300> more<00:02:12.330> time<00:02:12.480> and

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
one more time and

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.250 
one more time and
the<00:02:13.620> next<00:02:13.860> step<00:02:14.040> is<00:02:14.250> to<00:02:14.910> get<00:02:15.870> our<00:02:16.020> screen

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
the next step is to get our screen

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.920 
the next step is to get our screen
protector<00:02:16.740> in<00:02:16.830> place<00:02:17.100> so<00:02:17.640> that<00:02:17.670> we<00:02:17.880> can<00:02:18.090> use<00:02:18.330> it

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
protector in place so that we can use it

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.170 
protector in place so that we can use it
to<00:02:19.560> install<00:02:19.920> it<00:02:19.950> on<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:21.210> actual<00:02:21.420> phone<00:02:22.410> itself

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
to install it on the actual phone itself

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.250 
to install it on the actual phone itself
so<00:02:24.180> now<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:24.360> screen<00:02:24.630> protector<00:02:24.990> has<00:02:25.080> two

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
so now the screen protector has two

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.530 
so now the screen protector has two
components<00:02:25.560> to<00:02:25.860> it<00:02:25.980> at<00:02:26.730> first<00:02:27.120> you're<00:02:27.420> going

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
components to it at first you're going

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.199 
components to it at first you're going
to<00:02:27.630> be<00:02:27.960> probably<00:02:28.890> inclined<00:02:29.310> to<00:02:29.520> remove<00:02:29.910> the

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
to be probably inclined to remove the

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.330 
to be probably inclined to remove the
blues<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:31.170> blue<00:02:31.320> plastic<00:02:31.560> off<00:02:31.980> of<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.280> screen

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
blues the blue plastic off of the screen

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.640 
blues the blue plastic off of the screen
protector<00:02:32.820> don't<00:02:33.030> do<00:02:33.180> that<00:02:33.420> because<00:02:34.260> actually

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
protector don't do that because actually

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:35.900 
protector don't do that because actually
you're<00:02:34.830> going<00:02:35.010> to<00:02:35.070> use<00:02:35.220> this<00:02:35.430> to<00:02:35.610> guide<00:02:35.760> the

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
you're going to use this to guide the

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.670 
you're going to use this to guide the

try to lift the screen protector as you

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.830 
try to lift the screen protector as you
would<00:04:26.010> a

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
would a

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.840 
would a
e i<00:04:27.350> would<00:04:27.590> say<00:04:27.680> a<00:04:27.710> plastic<00:04:28.250> screen<00:04:28.400> protector

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
e i would say a plastic screen protector

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.450 
e i would say a plastic screen protector
and<00:04:29.060> because<00:04:29.720> the<00:04:30.139> glass<00:04:30.380> is<00:04:30.440> so<00:04:30.770> rigid<00:04:31.250> it's

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
and because the glass is so rigid it's

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.870 
and because the glass is so rigid it's
really<00:04:32.300> hard<00:04:32.510> to<00:04:32.690> use<00:04:33.110> tape<00:04:33.919> so<00:04:34.490> the<00:04:34.730> easiest

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
really hard to use tape so the easiest

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.420 
really hard to use tape so the easiest
way<00:04:35.330> to<00:04:35.389> do<00:04:35.600> that<00:04:35.630> is<00:04:35.960> by<00:04:36.590> just<00:04:36.620> taking<00:04:37.130> your

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
way to do that is by just taking your

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:40.240 
way to do that is by just taking your
finger<00:04:37.699> and<00:04:37.880> on<00:04:38.630> one<00:04:38.810> of<00:04:38.900> the<00:04:38.960> corners<00:04:39.250> lifting

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
finger and on one of the corners lifting

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:41.920 
finger and on one of the corners lifting
it<00:04:40.370> up<00:04:40.460> and<00:04:40.729> you'll<00:04:41.120> notice<00:04:41.419> that<00:04:41.449> as<00:04:41.720> I<00:04:41.870> do

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
it up and you'll notice that as I do

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.439 
it up and you'll notice that as I do
this<00:04:42.199> see<00:04:42.710> how<00:04:42.800> the<00:04:42.889> screen<00:04:43.220> lifts<00:04:43.850> up<00:04:43.940> once

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:44.449 
this see how the screen lifts up once

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:46.090 
this see how the screen lifts up once
the<00:04:44.510> screen<00:04:44.780> lifts<00:04:45.050> up<00:04:45.199> you<00:04:45.710> can<00:04:45.889> actually

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
the screen lifts up you can actually

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.000 
the screen lifts up you can actually
align<00:04:46.820> the<00:04:47.150> screen<00:04:47.360> protector<00:04:47.810> as<00:04:48.440> you'd<00:04:48.979> like

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:49.010 
align the screen protector as you'd like

just<00:06:54.720> was<00:06:55.140> a<00:06:55.170> little<00:06:55.350> bit<00:06:55.500> off<00:06:55.650> so<00:06:55.800> I<00:06:55.830> wanted

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:56.070 
just was a little bit off so I wanted

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:57.920 
just was a little bit off so I wanted
online<00:06:56.190> it<00:06:56.460> I<00:06:56.640> really<00:06:57.270> don't<00:06:57.450> see<00:06:57.510> any

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:57.930 
online it I really don't see any

online it I really don't see any
difference<00:06:58.560> with<00:06:58.860> the<00:06:58.980> actual<00:06:59.340> screen<00:06:59.640> on

00:06:59.810 --> 00:06:59.820 
difference with the actual screen on

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:00.980 
difference with the actual screen on
there<00:07:00.000> so<00:07:00.180> clarity<00:07:00.570> is<00:07:00.660> one<00:07:00.750> hundred<00:07:00.810> percent

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:00.990 
there so clarity is one hundred percent

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:03.350 
there so clarity is one hundred percent
there<00:07:01.400> again<00:07:02.400> the<00:07:02.550> hardness<00:07:02.790> that<00:07:02.940> we<00:07:03.120> talked

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 
there again the hardness that we talked

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.500 
there again the hardness that we talked
about<00:07:03.450> it's<00:07:04.110> a<00:07:04.230> shatter<00:07:04.470> resistant<00:07:05.150> glass<00:07:06.150> and

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:06.510 
about it's a shatter resistant glass and

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:08.420 
about it's a shatter resistant glass and
that's<00:07:07.110> important<00:07:07.620> because<00:07:07.650> if<00:07:07.950> you<00:07:08.040> do<00:07:08.190> drop

00:07:08.420 --> 00:07:08.430 
that's important because if you do drop

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:10.070 
that's important because if you do drop
your<00:07:08.610> phone<00:07:08.820> you<00:07:09.420> don't<00:07:09.570> even<00:07:09.690> want<00:07:09.990> your

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.080 
your phone you don't even want your

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.440 
your phone you don't even want your
protective<00:07:10.530> screen<00:07:10.830> to<00:07:11.070> crack<00:07:11.640> or<00:07:11.940> shatter<00:07:12.210> so

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:12.450 
protective screen to crack or shatter so

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:14.600 
protective screen to crack or shatter so
that's<00:07:12.600> important<00:07:13.080> as<00:07:13.170> well<00:07:13.350> and<00:07:13.620> then<00:07:14.070> once

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:14.610 
that's important as well and then once

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:17.330 
that's important as well and then once
again<00:07:14.880> it's<00:07:15.390> coated<00:07:15.690> so<00:07:16.110> you<00:07:16.830> really<00:07:17.190> not
