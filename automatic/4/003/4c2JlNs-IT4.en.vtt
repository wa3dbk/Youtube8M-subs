 hello everyone last month I 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:05.670
 went to england for 

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.650
 really green holidays 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.450
 in this video i'm going to share my 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:12.269
 trip with us and I will show you 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.370
 my hairstyle the first days we 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.840
 went to the nail is one of 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.390
 most spectacular castles in 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.190
 England with a zoo where 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.980
 the animals are in semi freedom 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.330
 it's a huge property in safari is 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.910
 to plan other attractions 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.350
 so we started with safaris on 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.750
 we passed close to the animals 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.369
 wild as you see the animals 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.420
 are free to wander where they want 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.760
 in the parks 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.130
 the park is quite large and the animals 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.110
 are very curious for example the monkeys 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.120
 do not hesitate to show on cars 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.340
 attention to the accessories of 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.430
 your car because the wise ones have 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:01:18.870
 tried to disassemble them 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:01:21.320

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.190
 you can also feed some 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.560
 animals for me it was 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:16.720
 parrots it was superb experience 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:19.440

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.440
 m 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.610
 after we read we left direction 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.770
 of stonehenge 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.349
 I must admit that I underestimated the 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.540
 wind force in england my tail of 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:34.239
 horse with trace elements fell 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.860
 in ruins so I learned my lesson and the 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.830
 next day I chose car capped 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.110
 disheveled in a messy bun that does not 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.700
 can not be devastated by the winds 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.500
 went to walk on the roads of 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.390
 cotswolds and we saw a few 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.530
 beautiful landscapes on the way 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.790
 [Music] 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.110
 I love all his sheep with his 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:03:10.319
 lambs

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:15.209

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:17.459
 is the oxford canal by bike I'm doing 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:20.430
 a twisted braid is needless to say 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:23.780
 the scenery is breathtaking as 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.780
 real paintings 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.870

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.540
 the fourth day was the day of 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.960
 easter it was raining and we stayed at the 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.210
 House 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.010
 I opted for a very simple hairstyle 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:41.490
 with some twisted locks and the 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:42.450
 hair released the following days we have 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:44.160
 visited oxford 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.680
 but that day I made my guy 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:50.520
 hairstyle it was in low bun inspired 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:52.170
 by elsa of the snow queen the 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.980
 last day of our vacation before 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.620

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.660

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.440
 another park to contemplate animals from 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.840
 all kinds 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:04.670
