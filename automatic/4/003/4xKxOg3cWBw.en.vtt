00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.730
 pyramid company has long recommended 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.410
 yourself as a favorite in the world of speed 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.160
 just look at the race cars 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.619
 Formula 1 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.240
 but this is not the only horse of the brand not 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.980
 forgets the brand and both of these powerful 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.750
 SUVs specifically for these 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.020
 car tire was developed 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:37.430
 pirelli scorpion verde 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.790
 Italian tire nickname managed to commit 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.980
 little miracle all the technology earlier 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.469
 available only in tires for powerful but 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.840
 light sports cars embodied in the new 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:50.600
 rubber for cars weighing noticeably 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.570
 more than two tons first turn 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.059
 pirelli scorpion tires made 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.609
 from environmentally friendly materials and not 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:01.370
 contains aromatic oils in the composition 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:02.809
 rubber mixture due to which have 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.800
 minimal environmental impact 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.140
 Wednesday 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.990
 both in the production process and on 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.120
 lifelong tire drawing 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.909
 tread repeats pattern 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:16.610
 headlining the entire lineup of the Cyril model 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.800
 silver pager but due to the fact that the tire 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.400
 designed for substantially increased 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.200
 loads 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.470
 days have their technological 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:27.560
 features about them will tell us our 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.000
 specialist summer tire pirelli scorpion 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.840
 verde is specially designed for 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.420
 SUVs 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.880
 yes it is really so beyond that 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.680
 when creating this model was used 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.710
 new technology patented by the company 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.300
 peregrin performance thanks to what this 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.050
 tire can also be attributed to the class 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:47.630
 green tires besides this she has 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:50.360
 new features in tread design a 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.480
 precisely in the center of the tread of 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.990
 4 wide hell diverting channels and also 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:59.060
 multidirectional network thanks to 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.620
 Why is water very fast and efficient? 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.710
 derived from contact patch 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.690
 beyond that optimized 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.820
 the arrangement of the tread blocks allows 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.590
 extremely confident car behave when 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.239
 active maneuvering is due to 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.410
 this achieved a significant reduction 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.239
 external noise 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.819
 some consumers the river may 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:18.860
 surprise original tread pattern 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.140
 it doesn't look like the package that 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.360
 used on 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.740
 SUV despite the fact that this 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.660
 the model is designed specifically for 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.300
 SUVs are its main elements 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.069
 is a city and a highway due to 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.860
 use a smooth pattern 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:35.530
 tread own speaking and succeeded 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.240
 significantly reduce the noise emitted 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.010
 tire for many consumers is 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.170
 very important asymmetrical pattern 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.550
 tread allows tire evenly 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.410
 distribute pressure in the contact patch 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.989
 due to which the contact area 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.430
 It is always a maximum mean 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.260
 that this tire has increased 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.730
 index speed up this model 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.860
 really has a high index 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.540
 speed so it is calculated for 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.700
 a wide range of modern powerful 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.100
 cars and now i would like 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.850
 debunk another myth 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.470
 common among our 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:04.540
 motorists of existence 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.519
 all season tires for our type of climate 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.650
 we have no such tires today 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:10.930
 because there is no such rubber in nature 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.090
 a mixture that would behave adequately as 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.780
 at temperatures of plus 30 degrees so im 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.780
 -thirty
