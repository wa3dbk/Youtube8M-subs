00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
oh my god I absolutely love them see my

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.940 
oh my god I absolutely love them see my
own<00:04:59.860> my<00:05:00.010> old<00:05:00.220> bike<00:05:00.460> the<00:05:00.700> shifter<00:05:01.120> was<00:05:01.270> up<00:05:01.419> here

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:01.950 
own my old bike the shifter was up here

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:05.580 
own my old bike the shifter was up here
but<00:05:02.950> on<00:05:03.070> this<00:05:03.280> one<00:05:03.510> it's<00:05:04.510> down<00:05:04.870> lower<00:05:05.260> and

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
but on this one it's down lower and

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.710 
but on this one it's down lower and
you'd<00:05:05.710> think<00:05:06.039> that<00:05:06.310> that<00:05:06.460> would<00:05:06.520> be<00:05:06.669> awkward

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 
you'd think that that would be awkward

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.500 
you'd think that that would be awkward
but<00:05:07.870> it<00:05:07.990> is<00:05:08.140> not<00:05:08.350> awkward<00:05:08.680> at<00:05:09.040> all<00:05:09.670> it's

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
but it is not awkward at all it's

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:13.800 
but it is not awkward at all it's
because<00:05:11.140> your<00:05:11.410> fingers<00:05:11.910> are<00:05:12.910> in<00:05:13.210> more<00:05:13.510> a<00:05:13.540> more

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
because your fingers are in more a more

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.840 
because your fingers are in more a more
natural<00:05:14.380> position<00:05:14.530> because<00:05:15.370> your<00:05:15.490> thumb<00:05:15.730> is

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:15.850 
natural position because your thumb is

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:17.580 
natural position because your thumb is
in<00:05:15.970> a<00:05:16.060> national<00:05:16.420> position<00:05:16.780> but<00:05:16.930> before<00:05:17.320> your

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 
in a national position but before your

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:19.140 
in a national position but before your
finger<00:05:17.980> would<00:05:18.430> have<00:05:18.610> to<00:05:18.730> be<00:05:18.820> way<00:05:19.000> up<00:05:19.120> here

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
finger would have to be way up here

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.240 
finger would have to be way up here
clicking<00:05:19.660> them<00:05:19.930> for<00:05:20.440> now<00:05:20.650> it's<00:05:20.920> just<00:05:20.980> down

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
clicking them for now it's just down

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:25.170 
clicking them for now it's just down
here<00:05:21.280> so<00:05:21.940> it's<00:05:22.170> kind<00:05:23.170> of<00:05:23.320> natural<00:05:23.530> I<00:05:23.920> guess<00:05:24.180> and

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
here so it's kind of natural I guess and

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.630 
here so it's kind of natural I guess and
then<00:05:25.540> it's<00:05:25.690> the<00:05:25.810> same<00:05:26.020> over<00:05:26.200> here<00:05:26.320> but<00:05:27.100> these

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:27.640 
then it's the same over here but these

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.190 
then it's the same over here but these
shifters<00:05:28.060> are<00:05:28.300> great

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:29.200 
shifters are great

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.700 
shifters are great
I<00:05:29.230> like<00:05:29.620> the<00:05:29.830> display<00:05:30.520> too<00:05:31.020> it<00:05:32.020> looks<00:05:32.260> kind<00:05:32.590> of

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710 
I like the display too it looks kind of

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:59.850 
I like the display too it looks kind of
stupid<00:05:33.160> but<00:05:42.900> but<00:05:44.130> sadly<00:05:46.020> the<00:05:57.960> GoPro<00:05:58.960> I<00:05:59.230> could

00:05:59.850 --> 00:05:59.860 
stupid but but sadly the GoPro I could

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.580 
stupid but but sadly the GoPro I could
try<00:06:00.100> though<00:06:00.310> oh<00:06:00.960> my<00:06:01.960> gosh

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:02.590 
try though oh my gosh

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:32.020 
for her ride glides pretty well though

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:43.150 
for her ride glides pretty well though
like<00:06:32.290> I'm<00:06:32.500> going<00:06:32.890> not<00:06:33.100> too<00:06:33.400> fast

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:43.160 

00:06:43.160 --> 00:07:04.490 

can't<00:06:44.160> really<00:06:44.310> pedal<00:06:44.730> hard<00:06:44.970> right<00:06:45.240> now<00:07:03.500> they

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:04.500 
can't really pedal hard right now they

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:10.070 
can't really pedal hard right now they
do<00:07:04.650> stutter<00:07:05.130> a<00:07:05.250> bit<00:07:07.430> for<00:07:08.430> this<00:07:08.910> bike<00:07:09.150> was<00:07:09.330> $6.99

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.080 
do stutter a bit for this bike was $6.99

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.530 
do stutter a bit for this bike was $6.99
so<00:07:10.470> for<00:07:10.650> $6.99<00:07:10.920> I<00:07:11.460> think<00:07:11.700> it's<00:07:11.820> pretty<00:07:12.030> good<00:07:12.210> I

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:12.540

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:16.360 
so for $6.99 I think it's pretty good I
don't<00:07:13.500> know<00:07:13.740> though<00:07:13.950> maybe<00:07:14.340> I<00:07:14.490> got<00:07:14.700> ripped<00:07:14.910> off
