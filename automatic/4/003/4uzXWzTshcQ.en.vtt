00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
back one of the front one of the back

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.820 
back one of the front one of the back
make<00:01:09.479> sure<00:01:09.630> those<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.930> stay<00:01:10.439> in<00:01:10.500> there<00:01:10.770> you

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
make sure those a stay in there you

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.980 
make sure those a stay in there you
don't<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:11.070> lose<00:01:11.189> them<00:01:11.369> so<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.659> is<00:01:12.750> what<00:01:12.869> your

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
don't to lose them so that is what your

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.130 
don't to lose them so that is what your
your<00:01:13.619> clutch<00:01:13.890> looks<00:01:14.100> like<00:01:14.720> right<00:01:15.720> there<00:01:15.900> so

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
your clutch looks like right there so

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.350 
your clutch looks like right there so
what<00:01:16.680> can<00:01:16.799> happen<00:01:17.009> is<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.369> spring<00:01:18.030> that<00:01:18.210> goes

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
what can happen is that spring that goes

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.170 
what can happen is that spring that goes
around<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:18.780> creates<00:01:19.140> that<00:01:19.200> rebound<00:01:19.920> on<00:01:20.180> that

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
around that creates that rebound on that

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.810 
around that creates that rebound on that
engages<00:01:21.540> inside<00:01:22.080> these<00:01:22.259> shoes<00:01:22.619> I<00:01:22.890> will<00:01:23.430> choose

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
engages inside these shoes I will choose

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.090 
engages inside these shoes I will choose
the<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.060> clutch<00:01:24.450> belt<00:01:24.689> itself<00:01:24.990> they<00:01:25.770> can<00:01:25.950> base

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
the the clutch belt itself they can base

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.560 
the the clutch belt itself they can base
the<00:01:26.280> stay<00:01:26.549> engage<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.150> create<00:01:27.299> a<00:01:27.330> lot<00:01:27.479> of

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
the stay engage and create a lot of

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.749 
the stay engage and create a lot of
friction<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:28.229> that<00:01:28.619> will<00:01:28.710> cause<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:28.920> lot<00:01:29.490> of

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
friction and that will cause a lot of

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.569 
friction and that will cause a lot of
starting<00:01:30.180> troubles<00:01:30.570> in<00:01:30.780> life<00:01:31.200> not<00:01:31.500> it'll<00:01:31.890> not

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
starting troubles in life not it'll not

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.810 
starting troubles in life not it'll not
even<00:01:32.820> start<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.180> engine<00:01:33.390> alone<00:01:34.009> so<00:01:35.009> that's<00:01:35.700> a

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
even start the engine alone so that's a

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.580 
even start the engine alone so that's a
big<00:01:36.000> problem<00:01:36.180> that<00:01:36.360> you<00:01:36.570> might<00:01:36.720> have<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:37.320> that

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
big problem that you might have and that

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.679 
big problem that you might have and that
could<00:01:37.829> be<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.220> issue<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:39.150> way<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.329> can<00:01:39.570> tell

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
could be the issue the way you can tell

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.910 
could be the issue the way you can tell
whether<00:01:39.900> or<00:01:40.049> not<00:01:40.369> that's<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.520> case<00:01:41.640> is

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
whether or not that's the case is

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.350 
whether or not that's the case is
translation<00:01:44.509> that's<00:01:45.509> right<00:01:46.079> their<00:01:47.360> problem

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
translation that's right their problem

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.780 
translation that's right their problem
that<00:01:48.479> you<00:01:48.540> can<00:01:48.689> have<00:01:48.840> is<00:01:49.170> tell<00:01:50.159> whether<00:01:50.520> or<00:01:50.700> not

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
that you can have is tell whether or not

that is the case when you turn your spur

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.639 
that is the case when you turn your spur
gear<00:01:53.490> normally<00:01:54.420> this<00:01:54.840> way<00:01:55.079> it<00:01:55.290> should<00:01:55.409> flow

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
gear normally this way it should flow

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.859 
gear normally this way it should flow
really<00:01:55.950> easily<00:01:56.460> like<00:01:56.670> it's<00:01:57.000> been<00:01:57.450> forever

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
really easily like it's been forever

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.469 
really easily like it's been forever
basically<00:01:58.469> if<00:01:58.860> it's<00:01:59.369> really<00:01:59.850> tough<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.299> feels

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
basically if it's really tough and feels

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.510 
basically if it's really tough and feels
grinding<00:02:01.259> that<00:02:01.890> would<00:02:02.009> be<00:02:02.130> your<00:02:02.280> clutch

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
grinding that would be your clutch

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.880 
grinding that would be your clutch
looking<00:02:03.270> also<00:02:03.479> I've<00:02:03.750> never<00:02:04.140> heard<00:02:04.619> of<00:02:04.710> too

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
looking also I've never heard of too

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.469 
looking also I've never heard of too
many<00:02:05.040> problems<00:02:05.189> with<00:02:05.340> this<00:02:05.520> there<00:02:06.119> could<00:02:06.450> be

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
many problems with this there could be

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:07.850 
many problems with this there could be
something<00:02:06.780> once<00:02:07.020> your<00:02:07.140> transmission<00:02:07.680> but<00:02:07.799> I

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
something once your transmission but I

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.790 
something once your transmission but I
really<00:02:08.280> doubt<00:02:08.459> that<00:02:08.700> for<00:02:08.849> a<00:02:08.940> new<00:02:09.090> truck

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
really doubt that for a new truck

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.850 
really doubt that for a new truck
so<00:02:11.330> that's<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.480> big<00:02:12.630> thing<00:02:12.660> inspect<00:02:13.350> it<00:02:13.530> that

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
so that's the big thing inspect it that

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.470 
so that's the big thing inspect it that
spring<00:02:14.190> should<00:02:14.370> be<00:02:14.520> well<00:02:14.760> or<00:02:14.910> pretty<00:02:15.300> well

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
spring should be well or pretty well

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.430 
spring should be well or pretty well
sunk<00:02:15.810> down<00:02:15.990> there

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
sunk down there

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.870 
sunk down there
and<00:02:16.830> there<00:02:16.980> should<00:02:17.100> be<00:02:17.130> lots<00:02:17.280> of<00:02:17.460> shoes<00:02:17.640> left

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
and there should be lots of shoes left

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.940 
and there should be lots of shoes left
if<00:02:18.090> it's<00:02:18.240> a<00:02:18.300> newer<00:02:18.450> truck<00:02:19.850> and<00:02:21.560> so<00:02:22.560> basically

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
if it's a newer truck and so basically

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.760 
if it's a newer truck and so basically
that's<00:02:23.280> what<00:02:23.910> can<00:02:24.140> cause<00:02:25.140> a<00:02:25.170> lot<00:02:25.350> of<00:02:25.470> troubles

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
that's what can cause a lot of troubles

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.490 
that's what can cause a lot of troubles
so<00:02:26.490> it<00:02:26.820> could<00:02:27.090> basically<00:02:27.780> just<00:02:27.900> mean<00:02:28.080> a<00:02:28.110> bad

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
so it could basically just mean a bad

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.440 
so it could basically just mean a bad
engine<00:02:28.890> from<00:02:29.040> Traxxas<00:02:29.580> I've<00:02:29.880> heard<00:02:30.270> of<00:02:30.360> that

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
engine from Traxxas I've heard of that

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.750 
engine from Traxxas I've heard of that
happening<00:02:30.690> it<00:02:31.200> just<00:02:31.260> it<00:02:32.250> does<00:02:32.520> happen

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
happening it just it does happen

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.670 
happening it just it does happen
sometimes<00:02:33.330> you<00:02:33.600> just<00:02:33.630> get<00:02:33.900> those<00:02:34.050> bad<00:02:34.260> ins<00:02:34.470> and

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
sometimes you just get those bad ins and

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.750 
sometimes you just get those bad ins and
this<00:02:34.770> I<00:02:34.860> mean<00:02:34.980> some<00:02:35.130> guys<00:02:35.280> have<00:02:35.400> broken<00:02:35.550> their

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
this I mean some guys have broken their

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.610 
this I mean some guys have broken their
engines<00:02:36.090> on<00:02:36.240> the<00:02:36.300> sixth<00:02:36.570> tank<00:02:36.810> though<00:02:37.020> the

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
engines on the sixth tank though the

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.100 
engines on the sixth tank though the
crank<00:02:37.860> rod<00:02:38.070> is<00:02:38.190> broken<00:02:38.310> can<00:02:39.210> idea<00:02:39.570> one<00:02:39.690> inside

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
crank rod is broken can idea one inside

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.810 
crank rod is broken can idea one inside
the<00:02:40.290> engine<00:02:40.440> looks<00:02:40.710> like<00:02:43.340> that's<00:02:44.340> right<00:02:44.520> here

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
the engine looks like that's right here

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.560 
the engine looks like that's right here
is<00:02:44.970> a<00:02:46.400> real<00:02:47.400> this<00:02:47.730> is<00:02:47.880> make<00:02:48.090> your<00:02:48.210> engine<00:02:48.360> to

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
is a real this is make your engine to

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.990 
is a real this is make your engine to
pieces<00:02:48.900> so<00:02:49.340> that's<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:50.430> back<00:02:50.550> plate<00:02:50.730> again

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
pieces so that's the back plate again

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.180 
pieces so that's the back plate again
generate<00:02:51.270> pull<00:02:51.540> that<00:02:51.660> off<00:02:51.840> this<00:02:52.770> is<00:02:52.950> what<00:02:53.100> you

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
generate pull that off this is what you

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.910 
generate pull that off this is what you
have<00:02:53.400> inside<00:02:53.730> all<00:02:54.660> right<00:02:54.720> what<00:02:55.530> I<00:02:55.560> was<00:02:55.680> telling

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
have inside all right what I was telling

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.700 
have inside all right what I was telling
you<00:02:56.040> about<00:02:56.070> is<00:02:56.400> these<00:02:56.520> crank<00:02:56.940> rods<00:02:57.210> right<00:02:57.360> here

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:57.710 
you about is these crank rods right here

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.080 
you about is these crank rods right here
I've<00:02:58.710> heard<00:02:58.950> of<00:02:59.040> guys<00:02:59.160> basically<00:02:59.400> breaking

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
I've heard of guys basically breaking

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.170 
I've heard of guys basically breaking
those<00:03:00.470> turn<00:03:01.470> braking<00:03:01.800> on<00:03:01.890> their<00:03:02.040> engines<00:03:02.400> so

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
those turn braking on their engines so

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.740 
those turn braking on their engines so
all<00:03:03.390> you<00:03:03.660> have<00:03:03.930> it's<00:03:04.170> very<00:03:04.590> very<00:03:04.830> simple

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
all you have it's very very simple

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.720 
all you have it's very very simple
basically<00:03:06.750> design<00:03:07.230> really<00:03:07.580> all<00:03:08.580> in

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
basically design really all in

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:09.740 
basically design really all in
measurements<00:03:09.120> and<00:03:09.180> stuff<00:03:09.270> it<00:03:09.480> does<00:03:09.600> get<00:03:09.720> a

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
measurements and stuff it does get a

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.500 
measurements and stuff it does get a
little<00:03:09.870> tricky<00:03:10.440> this<00:03:11.310> is<00:03:11.430> a<00:03:11.460> lousy<00:03:11.700> Max<00:03:12.060> 26

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
little tricky this is a lousy Max 26

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.360 
little tricky this is a lousy Max 26
engine<00:03:12.780> um<00:03:13.820> and<00:03:14.820> the<00:03:15.950> sleeve<00:03:16.950> is<00:03:17.070> all<00:03:17.190> messed

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
engine um and the sleeve is all messed

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.210 
engine um and the sleeve is all messed
up<00:03:17.580> it's<00:03:17.820> pretty<00:03:18.240> tired<00:03:18.480> but<00:03:18.740> anyway<00:03:19.740> this<00:03:20.160> is

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
up it's pretty tired but anyway this is

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.420 
up it's pretty tired but anyway this is
what<00:03:20.340> happens<00:03:20.810> you'll<00:03:21.810> see<00:03:22.080> inside<00:03:22.530> when<00:03:23.040> it

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
what happens you'll see inside when it

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.070 
what happens you'll see inside when it
starts<00:03:23.760> turning<00:03:23.970> you've<00:03:24.300> are<00:03:24.450> you're<00:03:24.840> you've

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
starts turning you've are you're you've

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.390 
starts turning you've are you're you've
got<00:03:25.200> the<00:03:25.290> carburetor<00:03:25.620> on<00:03:25.890> there<00:03:26.130> this<00:03:26.250> one

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
got the carburetor on there this one

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.070 
got the carburetor on there this one
doesn't<00:03:26.520> have<00:03:26.610> a<00:03:26.700> curb<00:03:26.880> on<00:03:27.000> it<00:03:27.180> it's<00:03:27.900> going<00:03:27.990> to

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
doesn't have a curb on it it's going to

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.140 
doesn't have a curb on it it's going to
open<00:03:28.230> up<00:03:28.530> and<00:03:28.709> your<00:03:28.800> fuel<00:03:29.220> is<00:03:29.430> getting<00:03:29.550> it<00:03:29.910> it's

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
open up and your fuel is getting it it's

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.400 
open up and your fuel is getting it it's
basically<00:03:30.360> going<00:03:30.720> to<00:03:30.780> sleep<00:03:31.020> into<00:03:31.260> your

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
basically going to sleep into your

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.830 
basically going to sleep into your
engine<00:03:31.670> and<00:03:32.670> it's<00:03:33.060> going<00:03:33.180> to<00:03:33.240> gather<00:03:33.390> up<00:03:33.540> down

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
engine and it's going to gather up down

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.080 
engine and it's going to gather up down
here<00:03:34.170> and<00:03:34.380> then<00:03:34.890> when<00:03:35.520> it<00:03:35.610> is<00:03:35.730> going<00:03:35.880> to<00:03:35.970> get

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
here and then when it is going to get

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.660 
here and then when it is going to get
forced<00:03:36.630> in<00:03:36.780> through<00:03:37.410> the<00:03:37.530> ports<00:03:38.010> and<00:03:38.190> if<00:03:38.580> you

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
forced in through the ports and if you

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.000 
forced in through the ports and if you
can<00:03:38.790> see<00:03:39.000> that<00:03:39.260> the<00:03:40.260> little<00:03:40.500> ports<00:03:40.800> in<00:03:40.890> there

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
can see that the little ports in there

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.440 
can see that the little ports in there
the<00:03:41.160> fuel<00:03:41.370> is<00:03:41.430> going<00:03:41.520> to<00:03:41.610> come<00:03:41.820> up<00:03:41.940> onto<00:03:42.360> the

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
the fuel is going to come up onto the

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.770 
the fuel is going to come up onto the
piston<00:03:42.630> and<00:03:42.990> that<00:03:43.709> is<00:03:43.980> when<00:03:44.250> your<00:03:44.370> glow<00:03:44.490> plug

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
piston and that is when your glow plug

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.300 
piston and that is when your glow plug
right<00:03:45.780> here<00:03:45.870> you<00:03:46.080> little<00:03:46.230> guy<00:03:46.410> it's<00:03:46.950> basically

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
right here you little guy it's basically

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.710 
right here you little guy it's basically
when<00:03:47.670> it's<00:03:47.820> glowing<00:03:48.150> orange<00:03:48.420> is<00:03:48.480> going<00:03:48.660> to

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
when it's glowing orange is going to

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.750 
when it's glowing orange is going to
ignite<00:03:48.959> that<00:03:49.020> fuel<00:03:49.410> with<00:03:49.680> all<00:03:49.860> the<00:03:50.400> elements

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
ignite that fuel with all the elements

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.150 
ignite that fuel with all the elements
of<00:03:50.820> air<00:03:51.000> and<00:03:51.209> everything<00:03:51.620> all<00:03:52.620> working

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
of air and everything all working

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.980 
of air and everything all working
together<00:03:53.310> you'll<00:03:53.850> have<00:03:54.060> basically<00:03:54.450> one

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:54.990 
together you'll have basically one

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.770 
together you'll have basically one
combustion<00:03:55.650> and<00:03:55.860> these<00:03:56.760> engines<00:03:57.180> will<00:03:57.480> wrap

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
combustion and these engines will wrap

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.690 
combustion and these engines will wrap
up<00:03:57.900> cyber<00:03:58.500> dust<00:03:58.740> on<00:03:58.890> my<00:03:59.010> shrine<00:03:59.190> is<00:03:59.370> going<00:03:59.550> well

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
up cyber dust on my shrine is going well

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.600 
up cyber dust on my shrine is going well
over<00:03:59.880> forty<00:04:00.270> forty-five<00:04:00.740> thousand<00:04:01.740> times<00:04:02.340> max

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
over forty forty-five thousand times max

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.520 
over forty forty-five thousand times max
throttle<00:04:03.090> up<00:04:03.240> and<00:04:03.420> down<00:04:03.570> which<00:04:04.320> when<00:04:04.440> you

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
throttle up and down which when you

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.860 
throttle up and down which when you
think<00:04:04.709> about<00:04:04.770> it<00:04:05.070> that's<00:04:05.190> pretty<00:04:05.459> crazy<00:04:05.870> um

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
think about it that's pretty crazy um

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.750 
think about it that's pretty crazy um
but<00:04:07.620> I<00:04:07.860> mean<00:04:07.920> these<00:04:08.160> are<00:04:08.310> really<00:04:08.430> really<00:04:08.580> high

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
but I mean these are really really high

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.570 
but I mean these are really really high
performance<00:04:09.239> engines<00:04:09.570> and<00:04:09.900> that's<00:04:10.800> what<00:04:11.190> anus

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
performance engines and that's what anus

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.449 
performance engines and that's what anus
that<00:04:11.700> nitro<00:04:11.940> engine<00:04:12.209> looks<00:04:12.360> like<00:04:13.070> so<00:04:14.070> I<00:04:14.160> hope

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
that nitro engine looks like so I hope

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.479 
that nitro engine looks like so I hope
this<00:04:14.610> helps<00:04:14.910> um<00:04:15.320> you<00:04:16.320> can<00:04:16.620> you<00:04:16.830> try<00:04:17.100> out<00:04:17.130> all

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
this helps um you can you try out all

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.570 
this helps um you can you try out all
this<00:04:17.609> troubleshooting<00:04:17.989> I<00:04:18.989> mean<00:04:19.950> it<00:04:20.160> depends

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580 
this troubleshooting I mean it depends

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:21.680 
this troubleshooting I mean it depends
for<00:04:20.700> every<00:04:20.850> shop<00:04:21.030> like<00:04:21.330> I<00:04:21.450> said

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
for every shop like I said

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.320 
for every shop like I said
it<00:04:21.750> could<00:04:22.080> actually<00:04:22.320> be<00:04:22.500> the<00:04:22.620> end<00:04:22.860> in<00:04:23.010> itself

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
it could actually be the end in itself

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:26.000 
it could actually be the end in itself
hopefully<00:04:24.330> that's<00:04:24.510> not<00:04:24.570> the<00:04:24.780> case

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
hopefully that's not the case

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.580 
hopefully that's not the case
and<00:04:26.400> the<00:04:27.030> only<00:04:27.180> way<00:04:27.450> Texas<00:04:28.170> does<00:04:28.320> have<00:04:28.350> an

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
and the only way Texas does have an

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.800 
and the only way Texas does have an
engine<00:04:28.980> replacement<00:04:29.280> plan<00:04:29.580> but<00:04:30.480> you're<00:04:30.600> only

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
engine replacement plan but you're only

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:31.910 
engine replacement plan but you're only
valid<00:04:31.080> for<00:04:31.140> that<00:04:31.320> though<00:04:31.470> if<00:04:31.710> you<00:04:31.800> actually

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:31.920 
valid for that though if you actually

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.540 
valid for that though if you actually
bought<00:04:32.190> the<00:04:32.280> truck<00:04:32.460> new<00:04:32.730> from<00:04:33.150> Traxxas<00:04:34.550> so

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
bought the truck new from Traxxas so

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.210 
bought the truck new from Traxxas so
that's<00:04:35.820> the<00:04:35.970> case<00:04:36.180> then<00:04:36.900> you<00:04:37.860> have<00:04:37.890> to<00:04:38.070> buy<00:04:38.160> the

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
that's the case then you have to buy the

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.940 
that's the case then you have to buy the
engine<00:04:38.580> out<00:04:38.670> of<00:04:38.700> your<00:04:38.850> own<00:04:38.940> pocket<00:04:39.800> but<00:04:40.800> yeah<00:04:40.920> I

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 
engine out of your own pocket but yeah I

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.330 
engine out of your own pocket but yeah I
hope<00:04:41.160> this<00:04:41.310> helped<00:04:41.610> and<00:04:42.570> so<00:04:43.470> everyone<00:04:44.190> on
