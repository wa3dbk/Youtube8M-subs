there that worked on the in the railroad
yards<00:00:27.610> I<00:00:27.820> guess<00:00:28.570> has<00:00:28.750> had<00:00:29.050> to<00:00:29.140> do<00:00:29.259> with<00:00:29.380> a<00:00:29.410> bet

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:29.650 
yards I guess has had to do with a bet

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:30.990 
yards I guess has had to do with a bet
for<00:00:29.859> a<00:00:29.919> bottle<00:00:30.279> of<00:00:30.340> whiskey<00:00:30.699> that<00:00:30.849> she

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.000 
for a bottle of whiskey that she

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.060 
for a bottle of whiskey that she

both<00:00:33.580> of<00:00:33.670> his<00:00:33.820> shoulders<00:00:34.239> and<00:00:34.480> carry<00:00:34.930> it<00:00:35.110> up

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:35.230

into<00:00:35.440> a<00:00:35.920> train<00:00:36.430> cart<00:00:36.730> and<00:00:36.970> I<00:00:37.690> guess<00:00:37.870> she<00:00:38.050> did<00:00:38.199> it

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.660 
really neat features like ice waterfalls
we<00:03:11.630> got<00:03:11.990> to<00:03:12.110> experience<00:03:12.530> some<00:03:12.860> of<00:03:13.010> the<00:03:13.160> best

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
we got to experience some of the best

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:34.470 
we got to experience some of the best
snow<00:03:13.940> and<00:03:14.390> terrain<00:03:15.050> of<00:03:15.230> the<00:03:15.350> trip

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.729 

those<00:03:35.480> last<00:03:35.720> two<00:03:35.840> turns<00:03:36.140> we<00:03:36.379> were<00:03:36.470> doing<00:03:36.650> at

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
those last two turns we were doing at

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:39.190 
those last two turns we were doing at
Smithers<00:03:37.099> was<00:03:37.269> probably<00:03:38.269> some<00:03:38.450> of<00:03:38.540> the<00:03:38.629> well

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
Smithers was probably some of the well

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:51.270 
Smithers was probably some of the well
it<00:03:39.319> was<00:03:39.470> the<00:03:39.709> best<00:03:39.890> snow<00:03:40.129> on<00:03:40.280> our<00:03:40.430> trip<00:03:40.670> so<00:03:40.879> far

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.220 

that<00:03:52.280> area<00:03:52.670> that<00:03:52.820> we<00:03:52.910> were<00:03:53.000> skiing<00:03:53.300> might<00:03:54.050> be

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:54.230 
that area that we were skiing might be

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.260 
that area that we were skiing might be
the<00:03:54.380> area<00:03:54.680> that<00:03:54.950> well<00:03:55.280> is<00:03:55.460> the<00:03:55.640> area<00:03:55.910> that<00:03:56.120> they

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:56.270 
the area that well is the area that they

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.080 
the area that well is the area that they
they<00:03:56.750> might<00:03:56.900> be<00:03:57.080> expanding<00:03:57.650> into<00:03:57.740> if<00:03:58.550> Smithers

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
they might be expanding into if Smithers

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.480 
they might be expanding into if Smithers
does<00:03:59.390> go<00:03:59.630> ahead<00:03:59.750> with<00:03:59.960> their<00:04:00.110> expansion<00:04:00.500> so<00:04:00.920> it

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:01.490 
does go ahead with their expansion so it

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:04.870 
does go ahead with their expansion so it
could<00:04:01.670> be<00:04:01.700> pretty<00:04:02.390> exciting<00:04:03.640> getting<00:04:04.640> into

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
could be pretty exciting getting into

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:15.670 
could be pretty exciting getting into
that<00:04:05.030> terrain<00:04:05.360> which<00:04:05.750> lifts<00:04:05.990> access

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.159 

yeah<00:04:16.680> with<00:04:16.889> the<00:04:17.100> trip<00:04:17.880> wrapping<00:04:18.750> up<00:04:18.900> now<00:04:18.930> I
