00:00:11.319 --> 00:00:15.739
 For the time being, of potential points, why was now at the 

00:00:15.739 --> 00:00:19.629
 Experiments in the ProA Photo Neelsen are a few functions 

00:00:19.629 --> 00:00:20.650
 respectively 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.310
 the driveway features 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.310
 and by van Bommel on with the all-rounder 

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:30.439
 van Bommel wants the refugees to recognize the device commonly second 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:31.470
 of her three children 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.650
 four fingers 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.600
 Kleinmann free everything here 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.410
 if five people call singers 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.200
 DD announces that not too much ago you can see 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.200
 for this larger display but also done enough 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.060
 and that works flawlessly Show «Monster corner pubs Nina likes 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.340
 Benchmark 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.460
 like MEMORIA 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.030
 who the device should be because this one but still not everyone likes it now 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.890
 politically engaged times 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.270
 for the speech be some heart 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.690
 to be built around Qualcomm Snapdragon processor 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.590
 as target group that should be the same as for example HTC Desire HD but also 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.350
 the same for the time being last year 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.440
 or 13 Vettel leaves 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.799
 also in Desire s this processor is built in 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:20.360
 as well as the 50-year-old 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.360
 we need the incredible 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.840
 so he was a painter with her health are second images 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.510
 Must run the company of Jerzy Miller and that means it can 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.130
 sometimes say different make me a quadrant benchmark 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.390
 already and the whole thing once 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.030
 the quadrant or what's going on, even Vettel sees yes do that 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.660
 different things that I have mentioned many times 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.710
 cdu-spokesman in port au port 2d and 3d graphics 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.630
 and we'll see what we do 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.630
 get for Verdi 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.230
 should not be too bad I think so about the pigeons of Marton 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:02.140
 six times the values ​​should be 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.900
 and Sony Ericsson 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.710
 6 um 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.349
 the Xperia Mini pro 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:11.749
 there's just a small display working the processor 

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:13.579
 for the cause also very fast 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:16.249
 thanks to the county council three of the 20 

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:19.249
 Pixels resolve the wide math pixel resolution or height 

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:23.449
 But there must be fewer performers such as a Sony Ericsson Xperia Arc 

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:25.599
 with 800 by 480 pixels 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:29.909
 but the same processor provided around a value of about 1000 works and 20 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.049
 that's not bad alright alright 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.739
 then Okotie would like to show playability 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:40.219
 just look at Engelbert Rio together » 

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:43.219
 m Aldi overwhelm the imagine how that will work 

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:46.899
 if we compare the data with the ladies phones 

00:02:49.029 --> 00:02:52.509
 Cham while 

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:53.829
 for children 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:55.619
 only music 

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:58.619
 No 

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:03.469
 Step by step 

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:06.469
 the national lie it 

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:10.979
 this flatrate is the most obvious player 

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:13.249
 what is there 

00:03:13.249 --> 00:03:16.709
 Maybe we can eventually pay question 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.709
 Hallyday leads for the authority 

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:31.789
 while their players 

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:35.719
 perform the transmitted 

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:38.719
 but warmly 

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:45.579
 I always want to play 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:46.759
 but 

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:49.759
 I see no reason 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:53.399
 Hammerer very much missing 

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:57.189
 The first two games had previously rejected offers 

00:03:58.429 --> 00:04:01.429
 rer 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:08.869
 everything will be relatively good 

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:11.279
 other suitcases show means to tour 

00:04:11.279 --> 00:04:13.639
 that's her here 

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:15.259
 around 

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:17.340
 which are said the 4 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.169
 Zeil 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:23.560
 with which the virtual with the book Sampras Mundi symbol still fit 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.590
 a D-pad and her husband Paul Sommer fit like the TuS Wüllen 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.499
 browser 

00:04:29.499 --> 00:04:31.150
 and that was it 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.150
 with this green the seconds the special characters 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.000
 Show that sometimes I can see the blood Make the light quotes 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.330
 is prevented 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.650
 I do not want anything in the background yet 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.650
 Vokoun novel appeared in Vienna 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.300
 show so it does not come on the summer break 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:57.620
 with the class 4b the control point therefore one can see that the light 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.620
 Use GALLER the dark on the keyboard very well 

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:02.749
 I am very good 

00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:05.999
 It's also worth the sight of a communal natural lake because it's the weather 

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:08.259
 get used to that a little bit 

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:11.559
 Percent now you need too over-clear as someone cash register yet 

00:05:11.559 --> 00:05:13.479
 much bigger what my worldview 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:16.490
 and they are not allowed to do that properly 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.259
 become blind with a little practice choir 

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:20.879
 DESEO made 

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:23.089
 in not with keyboard 

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:25.400
 you should often concern 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.910
 Sindelar would have to be space if you whatsoever bit its bit 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.910
 thick but in general very well done 

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:35.039
 and 

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:36.770
 instead of 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.529
 that was something we wanted to show 

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:43.699
 Later, the video medium will relax for you from the Sony Ericsson Xperia Mini 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:44.659
 Per 

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:48.349
 because then the danger of a mistake is to reelive or overwhelm 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:50.189
 dry the dots higher 

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:51.720
 Cable or via friends 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.840
 even if a tree would turn up here favor the video 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:55.400
 would 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.430
 Leave a Comment 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:57.119
 and so on
