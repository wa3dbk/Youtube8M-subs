Bowl
we'll<00:00:18.840> start<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.740> kitchenaid<00:00:20.460> just<00:00:20.699> it's

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
we'll start the kitchenaid just it's

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.830 
we'll start the kitchenaid just it's
slow<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:21.650> let<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:23.029> liquid<00:00:24.029> portion<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:24.750> the

slow and let the liquid portion and the
dry<00:00:25.019> portions<00:00:25.470> start<00:00:25.830> to<00:00:25.980> combine<00:00:29.150> if<00:00:30.150> we

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
dry portions start to combine if we

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.510 
dry portions start to combine if we
start<00:00:30.539> off<00:00:30.630> too<00:00:30.810> fast<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.380> we'll<00:00:32.279> have<00:00:32.399> an

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
start off too fast and we'll have an

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.729 
start off too fast and we'll have an
explosion<00:00:33.090> of<00:00:33.270> flour<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:34.170> we<00:00:34.320> don't<00:00:34.530> want

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
explosion of flour and we don't want

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:48.010 
explosion of flour and we don't want
that

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.190 

sometimes<00:00:48.829> I'll<00:00:49.100> lift<00:00:49.629> the<00:00:50.629> bowl<00:00:50.840> just<00:00:51.079> a

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:51.200 
sometimes I'll lift the bowl just a

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.540 
sometimes I'll lift the bowl just a
little<00:00:51.379> bit<00:00:51.500> to<00:00:51.620> help<00:00:51.770> it<00:00:51.950> pick<00:00:52.129> up<00:00:52.280> a<00:00:52.399> little

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
little bit to help it pick up a little

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.670 
little bit to help it pick up a little
bit<00:00:52.730> more<00:00:52.940> because<00:00:53.090> the<00:00:53.449> dough<00:00:54.050> hook<00:00:54.260> does<00:00:54.500> not

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
bit more because the dough hook does not

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.030 
bit more because the dough hook does not
come<00:00:54.920> in<00:00:55.040> contact<00:00:55.070> with<00:00:55.550> the<00:00:55.820> bottom<00:00:56.210> of<00:00:57.040> the

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.040 
come in contact with the bottom of the

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:06.130 
come in contact with the bottom of the
bowl<00:01:03.850> once<00:01:04.850> the<00:01:05.030> dough<00:01:05.269> starts<00:01:05.570> to<00:01:05.750> pick<00:01:05.990> up

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
bowl once the dough starts to pick up

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.680 
bowl once the dough starts to pick up
then<00:01:06.560> it<00:01:06.950> will<00:01:06.979> clean<00:01:07.430> down<00:01:07.850> to<00:01:08.030> the<00:01:08.149> bottom<00:01:08.450> of

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:08.690 
then it will clean down to the bottom of

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.670 
then it will clean down to the bottom of
our<00:01:09.290> Bowl<00:01:09.670> as<00:01:10.670> you<00:01:10.790> can<00:01:10.940> see<00:01:11.119> there<00:01:11.540> it<00:01:12.470> is

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
our Bowl as you can see there it is

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:21.910 
our Bowl as you can see there it is
beginning<00:01:12.890> to<00:01:13.159> pick<00:01:13.399> up<00:01:13.520> nicely<00:01:20.590> you<00:01:21.590> can<00:01:21.619> now

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
beginning to pick up nicely you can now

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.499 
beginning to pick up nicely you can now
see<00:01:22.190> that<00:01:22.429> the<00:01:22.550> dough<00:01:22.700> is<00:01:22.880> starting<00:01:23.210> to<00:01:23.330> pick

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
see that the dough is starting to pick

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:35.550 
see that the dough is starting to pick
up

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:42.190 

at<00:01:36.560> this<00:01:36.770> point<00:01:37.040> I'll<00:01:37.340> speed<00:01:40.750> our<00:01:41.750> whole<00:01:41.990> bar

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
at this point I'll speed our whole bar

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.920 
at this point I'll speed our whole bar
up<00:01:42.580> at<00:01:43.580> this<00:01:43.760> point<00:01:44.060> I'll<00:01:44.180> speed<00:01:44.480> the<00:01:44.630> Hobart

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
up at this point I'll speed the Hobart

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.570 
up at this point I'll speed the Hobart
up<00:01:45.280> to<00:01:46.280> maybe<00:01:46.460> a<00:01:46.610> four<00:01:47.000> setting<00:01:48.370> let<00:01:49.370> it<00:01:49.460> pick

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
up to maybe a four setting let it pick

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.940 
up to maybe a four setting let it pick
up<00:01:49.760> the<00:01:49.910> rest<00:01:50.120> it'll<00:01:50.450> sling<00:01:50.870> the<00:01:51.110> dough<00:01:51.740> out

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
up the rest it'll sling the dough out

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.470 
up the rest it'll sling the dough out
you<00:01:52.160> don't<00:01:52.220> want<00:01:52.430> to<00:01:52.490> run<00:01:52.580> it<00:01:52.670> really<00:01:53.090> hard

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:53.480 
you don't want to run it really hard

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.620 
you don't want to run it really hard
when<00:01:53.660> the<00:01:53.870> dense<00:01:54.230> dough<00:01:54.470> very<00:01:54.710> long<00:01:54.950> and<00:01:55.940> then

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
when the dense dough very long and then

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.460 
when the dense dough very long and then
I'll<00:01:56.750> bring<00:01:56.930> it<00:01:57.080> back<00:01:57.260> down<00:01:58.450> to<00:01:59.450> two<00:01:59.720> and<00:01:59.960> let

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
I'll bring it back down to two and let

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:12.820 
I'll bring it back down to two and let
it<00:02:00.590> just<00:02:00.950> knead<00:02:01.820> the<00:02:02.600> dough<00:02:02.630> for<00:02:02.810> a<00:02:03.230> while

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.180 

if<00:02:13.830> we<00:02:13.980> stop<00:02:14.810> our<00:02:15.810> machine<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:16.530> just<00:02:16.740> feel<00:02:16.980> the

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
if we stop our machine and just feel the

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:24.410 
if we stop our machine and just feel the
dough<00:02:20.630> it's<00:02:21.630> still<00:02:21.930> a<00:02:21.960> little<00:02:22.170> bit<00:02:22.410> cool<00:02:23.420> but

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
dough it's still a little bit cool but

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.050 
dough it's still a little bit cool but
it's<00:02:24.570> not<00:02:24.750> tacky<00:02:25.350> so<00:02:25.620> and<00:02:26.370> what<00:02:26.580> we're<00:02:26.730> looking

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
it's not tacky so and what we're looking

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.440 
it's not tacky so and what we're looking
for<00:02:27.090> is<00:02:27.650> a<00:02:28.650> dough<00:02:28.980> that<00:02:29.250> is<00:02:29.400> that<00:02:30.090> doesn't

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
for is a dough that is that doesn't

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.500 
for is a dough that is that doesn't
stick<00:02:30.690> to<00:02:30.810> our<00:02:30.840> skin<00:02:31.560> but<00:02:32.220> is<00:02:32.400> still<00:02:32.700> quite

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
stick to our skin but is still quite

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.260 
stick to our skin but is still quite
pliable<00:02:34.050> not<00:02:34.230> too<00:02:34.440> firm<00:02:34.770> if<00:02:35.100> it<00:02:35.580> was<00:02:35.730> sticky

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
pliable not too firm if it was sticky

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.880 
pliable not too firm if it was sticky
and<00:02:36.510> then<00:02:36.990> we<00:02:37.140> would<00:02:37.290> add<00:02:37.440> a<00:02:37.470> little<00:02:37.650> more

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
and then we would add a little more

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.490 
and then we would add a little more
flour<00:02:38.250> but<00:02:38.940> it<00:02:38.970> looks<00:02:39.330> like<00:02:39.600> we<00:02:39.840> probably<00:02:40.110> got

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
flour but it looks like we probably got

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.650 
flour but it looks like we probably got
about<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:40.920> right<00:02:41.100> amount<00:02:41.370> of<00:02:41.430> flour<00:02:41.700> first

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
about the right amount of flour first

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.960 
about the right amount of flour first
time<00:02:42.930> around<00:02:46.310> we'll<00:02:47.310> go<00:02:47.430> ahead<00:02:47.520> and<00:02:47.640> let<00:02:47.760> that

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
time around we'll go ahead and let that

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:49.820 
time around we'll go ahead and let that
need<00:02:48.480> for<00:02:48.750> a<00:02:48.810> little<00:02:48.959> longer<00:02:49.230> until<00:02:49.500> it's

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
need for a little longer until it's

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.460 
need for a little longer until it's
cleaned<00:02:50.100> up<00:02:50.250> a<00:02:50.520> good<00:02:51.510> portion<00:02:51.780> of<00:02:52.110> the<00:02:52.320> dough

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
cleaned up a good portion of the dough

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.490 
cleaned up a good portion of the dough
on<00:02:52.650> the<00:02:52.680> sides<00:02:53.070> and<00:02:54.000> that's<00:02:54.990> another<00:02:55.260> way<00:02:55.440> you

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
on the sides and that's another way you

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.410 
on the sides and that's another way you
can<00:02:55.709> tell<00:02:55.770> if<00:02:56.010> it's<00:02:56.160> too<00:02:56.370> wet<00:02:56.610> the<00:02:56.970> dough<00:02:57.150> will

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
can tell if it's too wet the dough will

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.710 
can tell if it's too wet the dough will
continue<00:02:57.959> to<00:02:58.700> stick<00:02:59.700> to<00:02:59.820> the<00:02:59.910> sides<00:03:00.090> and<00:03:00.450> won't

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
continue to stick to the sides and won't

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.320 
continue to stick to the sides and won't
start<00:03:00.990> to<00:03:01.140> clean<00:03:01.380> up<00:03:01.590> and<00:03:01.920> be<00:03:02.820> added<00:03:03.090> to<00:03:03.209> the

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
start to clean up and be added to the

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:10.280 
start to clean up and be added to the
dough<00:03:03.510> and<00:03:06.050> I<00:03:07.050> would<00:03:07.200> let<00:03:07.350> it<00:03:07.380> just<00:03:09.110> knead<00:03:10.110> the

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
dough and I would let it just knead the

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.890 
dough and I would let it just knead the
dough<00:03:10.320> with<00:03:11.010> this<00:03:11.220> dough<00:03:11.459> hook<00:03:11.700> for<00:03:12.690> about

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
dough with this dough hook for about

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.729 
dough with this dough hook for about
five<00:03:13.230> minutes<00:03:13.590> or<00:03:13.950> so<00:03:14.720> so<00:03:15.720> that<00:03:15.870> it's<00:03:16.019> very

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
five minutes or so so that it's very

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.310 
five minutes or so so that it's very
well<00:03:16.920> mixed<00:03:17.220> and<00:03:17.580> the<00:03:18.360> yeast<00:03:18.630> will<00:03:18.870> begin<00:03:19.170> to

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
well mixed and the yeast will begin to

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.390 
well mixed and the yeast will begin to
warm<00:03:21.350> because<00:03:22.350> of<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:22.680> friction<00:03:23.010> of<00:03:23.100> the<00:03:23.130> hook

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
warm because of the friction of the hook

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.800 
warm because of the friction of the hook
and<00:03:23.670> the<00:03:24.420> dough<00:03:25.019> will<00:03:25.050> begin<00:03:25.470> to<00:03:25.620> rise
