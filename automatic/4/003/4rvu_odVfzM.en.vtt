00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:06.620
 good to greet you all as always 

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:10.070
 today I'm going to show you quickly how 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:11.870
 put music but an mp3 on your xbox 360 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.300
 if you do not want to pass the hard disk that 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.490
 you can have like on top of 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.860
 xbox or people who have xbox slim 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.539
 the discs that go in the process 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:25.350
 super easy the first thing they have to 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:27.370
 have is your life with original music 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.490
 we open the tray it 's true I'm going 

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:29.490
 ahead 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:36.149
 we put our original music disc 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.079
 in this case this music that I am 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.640
 putting is music someone believes me 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.230
 so that afterwards there is not a problem with 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.750
 copyright 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.160
 we go to the original menu of our 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.750
 true console 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.590
 of the music doctor 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.590
 we put yes 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.920
 then to each state as said all the 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.739
 true 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.770
 here you can see the clues that is the 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.020
 disk that I put 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.299
 so 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.469
 we put the current disc true and you 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:11.469
 we can extract yes 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.000
 we mark all the clues we are going to 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:19.350
 extract 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.580
 and can be changed manually here 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.280
 Album name 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:27.790
 the interpreter and the gender we are going to 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.960
 let me put unknown with date this 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.480
 you can obviously change with the 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.390
 control of the xbox or if you guys 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.760
 they want they can connect a keyboard and what 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.580
 can move more faster since they are going to 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.260
 typing there is not delayed so much can be 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.360
 I have a wireless keyboard brand 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.610
 microsoft 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:49.000
 and you see the truth I use that keyboard 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:52.210
 to modify it good and after that 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.420
 is going to show this screen where it comes out 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:59.260
 which is extracting and shows the state 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.820
 from the view that this star we are going to 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.160
 use this part for while not to 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.930
 be waiting all the time good 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.330
 as we can see already the clues are 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.890
 almost ready there is an option also that 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.539
 I forgot to comment that 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.450
 while the tracks are copied 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.800
 you can press the button and on them 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.900
 change the name to the song on 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.310
 interpreter and gender is the same as 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.380
 we did with the disk earlier than 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.230
 I'm not going to move it because of time issues 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:26.310
 the truth being pre NomÃ¡s by logging 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:29.850
 example we already deleted we put 12 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.880
 and then we can save changes 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:35.450
 and it remains then here it would be ready 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.310
 we get ready 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.340
 and now if we go to our disk 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.340
 hard 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.740
 albums here is all the music 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.780
 select a good playback disc 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.780
 album 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.160
 and ready then you can only 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.280
 go out 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.450
 and ready to use your echo in normal mode as well 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.910
 they do not have to be depending on 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.800
 pendrives with mp3 or anything that 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.020
 clarify that the xbox does not play format 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.520
 mp3 has its own audio format on 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.950
 which always transforms the tracks of 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.780
 this format and so they reproduce is by 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.600
 that they are called a little the moment 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.150
 to copy the disk to the hard drive and 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.710
 when one puts an mp3 is the same as 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.380
 that the format is called x be done to me 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:30.390
 something like that good to say hello to 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.400
 all thanks for passing the people that 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.360
 do not like it in the video do not like 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.220
 Those who like to be liked 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.990
 and clarify that my console has argh 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.240
 in case someone later tells me 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:45.940
 I'm going to pawn out there I do not know 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.940
 I do not use the air alone that greetings
