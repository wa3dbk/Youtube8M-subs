and I think they also do like all around
the<00:00:14.849> world<00:00:15.000> stuff<00:00:15.240> so<00:00:15.420> you<00:00:15.509> can<00:00:15.630> order<00:00:15.870> from

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
wherever you are realistically so it

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.490

Campbell<00:01:34.350> sees<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.710> like<00:01:34.950> cheap<00:01:35.159> knockoffs

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
Campbell sees a like cheap knockoffs

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.340 
Campbell sees a like cheap knockoffs
from<00:01:35.700> eBay<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.329> I'd<00:01:36.450> quite<00:01:36.630> like<00:01:36.689> them<00:01:36.990> but

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
from eBay and I'd quite like them but

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.140 
from eBay and I'd quite like them but
not<00:01:37.590> as<00:01:37.710> much<00:01:37.890> as<00:01:38.189> my<00:01:38.369> damsels<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.030> then

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
not as much as my damsels and then

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.609 
not as much as my damsels and then
wanted<00:01:39.509> something<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:39.930> bit<00:01:40.049> different<00:01:40.170> so<00:01:40.590> I

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
wanted something a bit different so I

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.289 
wanted something a bit different so I
was<00:01:40.799> looking<00:01:40.920> at<00:01:41.159> what<00:01:41.280> he<00:01:41.400> actually<00:01:41.549> does<00:01:41.909> and

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
was looking at what he actually does and

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.840 
was looking at what he actually does and
the<00:01:43.259> damsel<00:01:43.530> wedges<00:01:44.130> came<00:01:44.310> up<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:44.579> I<00:01:44.670> thought

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
the damsel wedges came up and I thought

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.179 
the damsel wedges came up and I thought
oh<00:01:45.270> I've<00:01:45.930> got<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.290> get<00:01:46.380> myself<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.950> pair<00:01:47.130> of

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
oh I've got to get myself a pair of

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.490 
oh I've got to get myself a pair of
those<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.090> absolutely<00:01:48.299> love<00:01:48.960> wedges<00:01:49.409> as

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
those and I absolutely love wedges as

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.300 
those and I absolutely love wedges as
well<00:01:49.649> because<00:01:49.890> they're<00:01:50.009> more<00:01:50.130> of<00:01:50.189> an

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
well because they're more of an

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.690 
well because they're more of an
androgynous<00:01:50.720> style<00:01:51.950> shoe<00:01:52.950> I<00:01:53.159> suppose<00:01:53.549> they

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
androgynous style shoe I suppose they

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.950 
androgynous style shoe I suppose they
kind<00:01:53.909> of<00:01:53.970> do<00:01:54.090> look<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.329> little<00:01:54.450> bit<00:01:54.630> like<00:01:54.659> a

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
kind of do look a little bit like a

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.959 
kind of do look a little bit like a
heavy<00:01:55.350> piece<00:01:55.649> of<00:01:55.950> workmanship<00:01:56.670> but<00:01:56.850> they're

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
heavy piece of workmanship but they're

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.219 
heavy piece of workmanship but they're
not<00:01:57.060> actually<00:01:57.450> as<00:01:57.570> heavy<00:01:57.780> as<00:01:57.960> you<00:01:57.990> would

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
not actually as heavy as you would

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.319 
not actually as heavy as you would
imagine<00:01:58.320> they<00:01:58.649> are<00:01:58.799> which<00:01:59.729> is<00:01:59.850> always<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.119> good

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
imagine they are which is always a good

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.429 
imagine they are which is always a good
thing<00:02:00.360> because<00:02:00.630> if<00:02:00.840> you're<00:02:00.960> walking<00:02:01.079> around

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
thing because if you're walking around

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:02.870 
thing because if you're walking around
with<00:02:01.619> like<00:02:01.649> heavy<00:02:02.070> shoes<00:02:02.310> on<00:02:02.490> your<00:02:02.640> calves

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
with like heavy shoes on your calves

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.480 
with like heavy shoes on your calves
will<00:02:03.180> become<00:02:03.479> strong<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.530> masculine<00:02:04.950> which

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
will become strong and masculine which

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.069 
will become strong and masculine which
isn't<00:02:05.729> necessarily<00:02:06.299> what<00:02:06.509> everyone's<00:02:06.899> going

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
isn't necessarily what everyone's going

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.630 
isn't necessarily what everyone's going
for<00:02:07.290> in<00:02:07.380> their<00:02:07.530> image<00:02:07.740> so<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.129> total<00:02:08.310> price

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
for in their image so the total price

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.410 
for in their image so the total price
came<00:02:08.849> for<00:02:09.080> 129<00:02:10.080> pounds<00:02:10.500> I<00:02:10.800> believe<00:02:11.039> in

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
came for 129 pounds I believe in

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.420 
came for 129 pounds I believe in
cooling<00:02:11.780> delivery<00:02:12.170> which<00:02:12.590> is<00:02:12.709> quite<00:02:12.890> good<00:02:13.099> and

really Pleasant and pleasing to wear but
yeah<00:02:30.020> basically<00:02:30.260> I<00:02:30.560> thought<00:02:30.770> I'd<00:02:30.860> just<00:02:30.980> jump

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
yeah basically I thought I'd just jump

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.979 
yeah basically I thought I'd just jump
on<00:02:31.310> the<00:02:31.400> Jeffrey<00:02:31.670> Campbell<00:02:31.850> bandwagon<00:02:32.810> and

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
on the Jeffrey Campbell bandwagon and

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:34.690 
on the Jeffrey Campbell bandwagon and
grab<00:02:33.170> myself<00:02:33.350> a<00:02:33.620> pair<00:02:33.800> and<00:02:33.980> to<00:02:34.340> be<00:02:34.400> honest<00:02:34.610> I

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
grab myself a pair and to be honest I

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:35.979 
grab myself a pair and to be honest I
haven't<00:02:34.880> worn<00:02:35.150> them<00:02:35.239> anywhere<00:02:35.569> yet<00:02:35.750> and<00:02:35.900> it's

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
haven't worn them anywhere yet and it's

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.540 
haven't worn them anywhere yet and it's
kind<00:02:36.290> of<00:02:36.380> difficult<00:02:36.560> to<00:02:36.860> think<00:02:36.980> of<00:02:37.130> a<00:02:37.190> place<00:02:37.340> to

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
kind of difficult to think of a place to

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.400 
kind of difficult to think of a place to
wear<00:02:37.730> them<00:02:37.940> because<00:02:38.360> obviously<00:02:38.900> they're

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
wear them because obviously they're

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.620 
wear them because obviously they're
quite<00:02:39.620> a<00:02:39.860> standout<00:02:40.610> piece<00:02:40.970> so<00:02:41.269> you<00:02:41.360> have<00:02:41.510> to

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
quite a standout piece so you have to

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.089 
quite a standout piece so you have to
wear<00:02:41.780> them<00:02:41.959> to<00:02:42.140> an<00:02:42.260> event<00:02:42.500> that's<00:02:42.739> going<00:02:42.830> to

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
wear them to an event that's going to

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:45.370 
wear them to an event that's going to
allow<00:02:43.310> such<00:02:43.670> standout<00:02:44.120> pieces<00:02:44.360> I<00:02:44.720> don't<00:02:45.260> know

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
allow such standout pieces I don't know
