wing nuts take off that first I'm going

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.290 
wing nuts take off that first I'm going
to<00:00:45.910> loosen<00:00:46.360> those<00:00:46.840> bolts<00:00:47.470> right<00:00:47.680> there<00:00:48.300> and

to loosen those bolts right there and

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.170 
to loosen those bolts right there and
then<00:00:50.260> put<00:00:50.830> this<00:00:50.920> socket<00:00:51.400> in<00:00:51.490> there<00:00:51.670> to<00:00:51.820> loosen

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
then put this socket in there to loosen

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.950 
then put this socket in there to loosen
the<00:00:52.270> belt<00:00:53.190> there<00:00:54.190> is<00:00:54.430> a<00:00:54.460> diagram<00:00:55.420> right<00:00:55.720> there

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
the belt there is a diagram right there

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.550 
the belt there is a diagram right there
to<00:00:56.140> tell<00:00:56.410> me<00:00:56.530> how<00:00:56.680> to<00:00:56.740> put<00:00:56.950> it<00:00:57.040> back<00:00:57.130> on

00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:58.560 
to tell me how to put it back on

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.060 
to tell me how to put it back on
yeah<00:00:59.560> so<00:00:59.950> I<00:00:59.980> will<00:01:01.110> update<00:01:02.110> you<00:01:02.470> once<00:01:02.770> they<00:01:02.950> get

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.460 
yeah so I will update you once they get
everything<00:01:03.400> taken<00:01:03.850> apart<00:01:07.200> what's<00:01:08.200> going<00:01:08.409> on

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
everything taken apart what's going on

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.530 
everything taken apart what's going on
so<00:01:08.770> this<00:01:09.310> is<00:01:09.520> the<00:01:09.700> halfway<00:01:09.909> mark

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
so this is the halfway mark

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.510 
so this is the halfway mark
I've<00:01:11.549> DW<00:01:12.549> 40<00:01:12.939> the<00:01:13.150> bolts<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:15.100> get<00:01:15.189> them<00:01:15.280> loose

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
I've DW 40 the bolts to get them loose

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.800 
I've DW 40 the bolts to get them loose
and<00:01:15.970> took<00:01:16.479> a<00:01:17.609> wrench<00:01:18.609> to<00:01:18.759> loosen<00:01:18.909> the<00:01:19.390> belt

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
and took a wrench to loosen the belt

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.859 
and took a wrench to loosen the belt
there's<00:01:20.200> the<00:01:20.439> belt<00:01:20.649> right<00:01:20.770> there<00:01:21.659> then<00:01:22.659> now

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
there's the belt right there then now

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:27.590 
there's the belt right there then now
there<00:01:23.289> are<00:01:23.890> as<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:25.659> can<00:01:26.049> see<00:01:26.350> one<00:01:26.770> two<00:01:27.100> three

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
there are as you can see one two three

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.120 
there are as you can see one two three
four<00:01:28.600> four<00:01:29.200> bolts<00:01:29.999> underneath<00:01:31.799> one<00:01:32.799> being

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
four four bolts underneath one being

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.429 
four four bolts underneath one being
right<00:01:33.969> there<00:01:36.240> another<00:01:37.240> one<00:01:37.630> being<00:01:38.229> right

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 
right there another one being right

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:41.699 
right there another one being right
there<00:01:39.179> so<00:01:40.179> I<00:01:40.210> need<00:01:40.359> to<00:01:40.420> take<00:01:40.569> those<00:01:40.749> four<00:01:41.530> bolts

00:01:41.699 --> 00:01:41.709 
there so I need to take those four bolts

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:46.620 
there so I need to take those four bolts
out<00:01:42.039> and<00:01:42.100> snake<00:01:42.909> this<00:01:43.709> water<00:01:44.709> pump<00:01:44.829> out<00:01:45.630> just

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
out and snake this water pump out just

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.929 
out and snake this water pump out just
well<00:01:46.810> Matt<00:01:46.990> and<00:01:47.200> I<00:01:47.319> also<00:01:47.469> took<00:01:47.679> off<00:01:48.039> the<00:01:48.369> air

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 
well Matt and I also took off the air

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:53.219 
well Matt and I also took off the air
cleaner<00:01:49.270> obviously<00:01:51.509> yep<00:01:52.509> that's<00:01:53.020> just

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
cleaner obviously yep that's just

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.809 
cleaner obviously yep that's just
halfway<00:01:53.560> mark<00:01:55.049> so<00:01:56.049> the<00:01:56.499> water<00:01:56.950> pump<00:01:57.219> is<00:01:57.369> up<00:01:57.549> I

00:01:57.809 --> 00:01:57.819 
halfway mark so the water pump is up I

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:01.109 
halfway mark so the water pump is up I
ended<00:01:58.240> up<00:01:58.359> having<00:01:58.659> to<00:01:58.899> take<00:01:59.259> off<00:01:59.799> the<00:02:00.159> top

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
ended up having to take off the top

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.699 
ended up having to take off the top
radiator<00:02:01.719> hose<00:02:02.049> to<00:02:02.649> get<00:02:02.950> out<00:02:03.189> of<00:02:03.340> this<00:02:03.429> space

00:02:04.699 --> 00:02:04.709 
radiator hose to get out of this space

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:07.349 
radiator hose to get out of this space
so<00:02:05.709> the<00:02:05.859> bolts<00:02:06.130> one<00:02:06.279> strip<00:02:06.670> out<00:02:06.819> I<00:02:06.850> took<00:02:07.179> off

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:07.359 
so the bolts one strip out I took off

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:10.380 
so the bolts one strip out I took off
the<00:02:07.840> two<00:02:08.080> bottom<00:02:08.530> ones<00:02:08.560> and<00:02:09.220> then<00:02:09.880> while

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
the two bottom ones and then while

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.230 
the two bottom ones and then while
supporting<00:02:11.230> the<00:02:11.470> water<00:02:11.650> pump<00:02:12.040> take<00:02:12.340> off<00:02:12.520> the

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
supporting the water pump take off the

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.320 
supporting the water pump take off the
top<00:02:13.540> left<00:02:13.959> and<00:02:14.290> then<00:02:15.160> the<00:02:15.370> top<00:02:15.580> right<00:02:15.910> while

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
top left and then the top right while

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.559 
top left and then the top right while
supporting<00:02:16.990> it<00:02:17.140> and<00:02:17.400> I<00:02:18.400> also<00:02:18.819> had<00:02:19.060> to<00:02:19.180> take<00:02:19.360> off

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
supporting it and I also had to take off

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:20.950 
supporting it and I also had to take off
the<00:02:19.900> bottom

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960 
the bottom

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:30.690 
the bottom
is<00:02:21.050> down<00:02:21.740> there<00:02:25.060> and<00:02:28.030> here's<00:02:29.030> a<00:02:29.120> look<00:02:29.510> at<00:02:29.900> the

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
is down there and here's a look at the

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:43.300 
is down there and here's a look at the
old<00:02:31.700> water<00:02:32.000> pump<00:02:37.420> never<00:02:38.420> knew

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.670 

so<00:02:44.170> looks<00:02:45.170> good<00:02:45.970> my<00:02:46.970> dad<00:02:47.240> was<00:02:47.959> wanting<00:02:48.380> me<00:02:48.500> to

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
want to get it on to figure out and see

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.000 
want to get it on to figure out and see
if<00:03:01.069> it<00:03:01.930> replacing<00:03:02.930> the<00:03:03.020> water<00:03:03.230> pump<00:03:03.500> fixes

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
if it replacing the water pump fixes

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.640 
if it replacing the water pump fixes
overheating<00:03:04.670> problems<00:03:05.090> so<00:03:05.360> yeah<00:03:06.260> so<00:03:06.440> that<00:03:06.560> was
