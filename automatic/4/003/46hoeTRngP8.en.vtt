this<00:00:16.949> episode<00:00:17.340> we're<00:00:17.490> gonna<00:00:17.550> be<00:00:17.670> doing<00:00:17.970> a<00:00:18.029> car

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
this episode we're gonna be doing a car

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.150 
this episode we're gonna be doing a car
which<00:00:18.449> isn't<00:00:18.630> particularly<00:00:19.020> rare<00:00:19.470> and<00:00:19.740> that

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
which isn't particularly rare and that

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.590 
which isn't particularly rare and that
is<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.430> Mercedes<00:00:20.930> c63<00:00:21.930> AMG<00:00:22.970> 507<00:00:23.970> edition

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
is the Mercedes c63 AMG 507 edition

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.200 
is the Mercedes c63 AMG 507 edition
so<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.439> 507<00:00:26.010> isn't<00:00:26.250> a<00:00:26.279> particularly<00:00:26.550> rare<00:00:26.880> car

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
so the 507 isn't a particularly rare car

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.509 
so the 507 isn't a particularly rare car
I<00:00:27.480> mean<00:00:27.930> it's<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.680> last<00:00:28.859> in<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.189> production

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
I mean it's the last in the production

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.060 
I mean it's the last in the production
line<00:00:29.820> of<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.359> AMG<00:00:30.960> c-class<00:00:31.260> and<00:00:31.830> it<00:00:31.980> was

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
line of the AMG c-class and it was

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.590 
line of the AMG c-class and it was
designed<00:00:32.399> pretty<00:00:32.669> much<00:00:32.790> to<00:00:32.969> compete<00:00:33.300> directly

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
designed pretty much to compete directly

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.819 
designed pretty much to compete directly
with<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:34.140> new<00:00:34.590> bmw<00:00:35.250> m3<00:00:35.660> it's<00:00:36.660> got<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:36.930> 6.3

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
with the new bmw m3 it's got a 6.3

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.369 
with the new bmw m3 it's got a 6.3
letting<00:00:38.129> naturally<00:00:38.610> aspirated<00:00:38.969> v8<00:00:39.329> which<00:00:40.140> is

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
letting naturally aspirated v8 which is

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.560 
letting naturally aspirated v8 which is
one<00:00:41.040> of<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.190> nicest<00:00:41.370> sounding<00:00:41.910> bits<00:00:42.239> I<00:00:42.390> think

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
one of the nicest sounding bits I think

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.430 
one of the nicest sounding bits I think
on<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.780> market<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.890> 507<00:00:44.579> actually<00:00:44.940> refers<00:00:45.239> to

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
on the market the 507 actually refers to

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.020 
on the market the 507 actually refers to
507<00:00:46.440> horsepower<00:00:46.469> which<00:00:47.250> is<00:00:47.280> an<00:00:47.700> improvement

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
507 horsepower which is an improvement

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.240 
507 horsepower which is an improvement
of<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.329> previous<00:00:49.140> version<00:00:49.559> of<00:00:49.620> it<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:49.920> it's

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
of the previous version of it and it's

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.939 
of the previous version of it and it's
actually<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.640> last<00:00:50.879> 6.3<00:00:51.750> liter<00:00:52.020> v8<00:00:52.739> that

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
actually the last 6.3 liter v8 that

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.170 
actually the last 6.3 liter v8 that
they're<00:00:53.100> going<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.280> be<00:00:53.370> doing<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:53.760> think<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:54.000> new

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
they're going to be doing I think a new
