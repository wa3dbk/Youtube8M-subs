00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.879
 hello to all subscribers continue 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.840
 big test vase solid 93 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:12.300
 and today we have an interior 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.299
 Nines such that I just do not know why 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:20.810
 start all this dick all about just 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:24.029
 pizdets well time it is necessary then we must begin 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.740
 the first thing that catches your eye is of course 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:30.510
 same 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:33.960
 here is this panel listen to what current 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:39.210
 this hard cheap plastic which 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:42.270
 all vibrates which all creak 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:47.460
 which knocks on any even small 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:50.370
 minor fossa and all that sound 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.129
 just unrealistic well so tired of everybody 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.030
 motorists you look it consists 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.980
 of the pieces she and now squeaks and and even 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.770
 just screwed onto the screws 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.150
 the role of the car but it's just bullshit 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.409
 that's fucked that year give it up 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.229
 designer of AvtoVAZ you there than 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.869
 do not move when you see 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.750
 speedometer or rather the readings 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.490
 so here you have a little right 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:20.009
 glass head to see what 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.130
 the speed of the tachometer is the same not visible 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.200
 dressed in the arrow is not that it's just fucked up 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.619
 what are you for whom did you do that in exchange for 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.720
 Chinese or something so small 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:32.210
 gum that didnâ€™t take me on the road 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.000
 will be seen behind the janitors 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:38.189
 door card do you look she too 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.520
 all vibrate too hard plastic 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.770
 so horror a few words about the windows on 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.220
 Of course mechanical is just hard 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:51.720
 see how it opens opens 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:54.869
 more or less your cagula closes 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.770
 it works now and i don't know what 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.000
 will be in a week 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.960
 now this door no longer opens and 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.600
 has broken 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.110
 and the handle is stuck to not even pulled 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.710
 does not close another mil from the car 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.810
 it's handbrake 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:14.510
 lessons are tough but little effective i 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.450
 constantly have to pull 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.750
 Astana follow him so just 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.750
 fucked up 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:28.520
 another huge minus from the car 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.890
 this is a safety belt 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:34.530
 I can't even pull it out now 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.930
 from there a represents if you are driving along 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.850
 track you are not wearing your seat 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:45.890
 worth the policeman and you try 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:47.209
 fasten yourself but this is not working 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.459
 zapadlo 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:54.769
 another huge minus of this salon 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:03:00.209
 this stove is constantly flowing faucet heater 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:03:03.090
 the radiator itself is constantly flowing these levers 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:05.790
 these are neurons or pressed do not creak 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.570
 When you press it, it's just some kind of horror 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.840
 fucked up 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:12.930
 but this is still bullshit is the most fucking when 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:16.170
 you sit down and the interior podkuri whom you 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.989
 shit such a huge puddle of antifreeze 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.620
 evaporation this smell this here it antifreeze 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.549
 it's fucking incredible feeling well 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.390
 let's go see what's behind 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.390
 happens 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:44.420
 so the first feeling is very little space 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.850
 for the head or abut the ceiling but 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:51.020
 regarding the fireplace of course instead of another 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:54.890
 well enough, I think probably three 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:58.580
 it will be a bit crowded here a few more words 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:00.500
 a few words about this here in the shelves 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:03.470
 principle function is understandable 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.870
 how it knocks how it squeaks on every 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:09.950
 when I train them 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:13.640
 still forgot to reveal her completely she still 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:16.250
 more vibrating it was a review of the salon 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:20.680
