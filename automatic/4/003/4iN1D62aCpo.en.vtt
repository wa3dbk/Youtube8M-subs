far<00:02:20.460> as<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:20.940> shingles<00:02:21.420> I<00:02:21.570> did<00:02:21.750> get<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:22.050> drip

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
far as the shingles I did get the drip

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.000 
far as the shingles I did get the drip
in<00:02:22.530> here<00:02:22.800> I<00:02:22.980> would<00:02:23.490> say<00:02:23.790> put<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:24.840> drip<00:02:25.110> trim<00:02:25.770> in

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
in here I would say put the drip trim in

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.880 
in here I would say put the drip trim in
first<00:02:26.460> and<00:02:26.760> layer<00:02:27.120> paper<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:28.290> instructions

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
first and layer paper the instructions

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.210 
first and layer paper the instructions
don't<00:02:29.010> say<00:02:29.280> lay<00:02:29.490> paper<00:02:30.050> but<00:02:31.050> I'm<00:02:31.830> waiting<00:02:32.070> to

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
don't say lay paper but I'm waiting to

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.740 
don't say lay paper but I'm waiting to
see<00:02:32.370> if<00:02:32.460> I<00:02:32.580> can't<00:02:32.790> get<00:02:32.910> some<00:02:33.120> shingles<00:02:33.360> for

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
see if I can't get some shingles for

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.100 
see if I can't get some shingles for
free<00:02:34.020> so<00:02:34.410> I<00:02:35.000> would<00:02:36.000> lay<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.300> paper<00:02:36.510> over<00:02:36.810> the

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
free so I would lay the paper over the

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.100 
free so I would lay the paper over the
top<00:02:37.350> of<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:38.430> drip<00:02:38.820> there's<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:39.780> only<00:02:39.900> thing

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
top of the drip there's the only thing

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:50.870 
top of the drip there's the only thing
I'd<00:02:40.230> do<00:02:40.410> different<00:02:40.830> up<00:02:40.920> there<00:02:44.270> what<00:02:45.270> else<00:02:49.880> on

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
I'd do different up there what else on

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.080 
I'd do different up there what else on
this<00:02:51.240> 10<00:02:51.510> by<00:02:51.540> 10<00:02:51.930> they<00:02:52.110> use<00:02:52.490> you<00:02:53.490> have<00:02:53.610> when<00:02:53.970> you

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
this 10 by 10 they use you have when you

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:00.950 
this 10 by 10 they use you have when you
do<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.660> roof<00:02:55.470> joist<00:02:57.710> it<00:02:58.710> talks<00:02:58.980> about<00:02:59.780> doing<00:03:00.780> a

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:00.960 
do the roof joist it talks about doing a

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:05.770 
do the roof joist it talks about doing a
quarter-inch<00:03:01.380> reveal<00:03:02.120> on<00:03:03.120> the<00:03:03.270> end<00:03:03.660> board<00:03:03.990> and

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
quarter-inch reveal on the end board and

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.390 
quarter-inch reveal on the end board and
just<00:03:06.780> whatever<00:03:06.990> you<00:03:07.290> do<00:03:07.470> follow<00:03:07.980> the<00:03:08.250> angle

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
just whatever you do follow the angle

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:14.390 
just whatever you do follow the angle
cut<00:03:09.030> into<00:03:10.280> the<00:03:11.480> 2x4<00:03:12.480> that<00:03:12.920> creates<00:03:13.920> the<00:03:14.160> pitch

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
cut into the 2x4 that creates the pitch

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.699 
cut into the 2x4 that creates the pitch
follow<00:03:15.180> that<00:03:15.450> angle<00:03:15.840> because<00:03:16.260> at<00:03:16.380> the<00:03:16.470> end<00:03:16.500> of

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
follow that angle because at the end of

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.250 
follow that angle because at the end of
the<00:03:16.770> day<00:03:16.950> there's<00:03:17.910> gonna<00:03:18.120> be<00:03:18.300> a<00:03:18.330> 90<00:03:18.900> degree

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
the day there's gonna be a 90 degree

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.190 
the day there's gonna be a 90 degree
here<00:03:20.000> and<00:03:21.000> this<00:03:21.300> is<00:03:21.450> what<00:03:21.660> you<00:03:21.780> really<00:03:22.050> want

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
here and this is what you really want

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.050 
here and this is what you really want
this<00:03:22.620> is<00:03:22.770> what's<00:03:22.950> gonna<00:03:23.100> be<00:03:23.310> most<00:03:23.489> important

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
this is what's gonna be most important

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.500 
this is what's gonna be most important
is<00:03:24.150> that<00:03:24.180> this<00:03:25.190> it's<00:03:26.190> gonna<00:03:26.340> be<00:03:26.550> 90<00:03:27.000> here<00:03:27.330> if

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
is that this it's gonna be 90 here if

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.990 
is that this it's gonna be 90 here if
you<00:03:27.690> do<00:03:27.870> any<00:03:28.140> other<00:03:28.380> if<00:03:29.220> you<00:03:29.370> try<00:03:29.580> to<00:03:29.640> use<00:03:29.820> that

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
you do any other if you try to use that

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.850 
you do any other if you try to use that
scab<00:03:30.510> piece<00:03:33.020> then<00:03:34.020> that's<00:03:34.260> gonna<00:03:34.500> give<00:03:34.770> you

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
scab piece then that's gonna give you

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.640 
scab piece then that's gonna give you
the<00:03:34.980> wrong<00:03:35.190> angle<00:03:35.459> so<00:03:36.270> just<00:03:36.510> go<00:03:36.630> ahead<00:03:36.870> and<00:03:36.989> use

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
the wrong angle so just go ahead and use

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.979 
the wrong angle so just go ahead and use
the<00:03:37.800> angle<00:03:38.100> cut<00:03:38.310> into<00:03:38.520> the<00:03:38.610> two<00:03:38.760> by<00:03:38.970> fours<00:03:39.269> it

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
the angle cut into the two by fours it

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.380 
the angle cut into the two by fours it
seems<00:03:40.260> that<00:03:40.380> they<00:03:40.500> use<00:03:40.680> that<00:03:40.920> scab<00:03:41.730> piece<00:03:42.060> for

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
seems that they use that scab piece for

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.270 
seems that they use that scab piece for
multiple<00:03:43.489> sheds<00:03:44.489> and<00:03:45.180> it's<00:03:46.140> cut<00:03:46.440> for<00:03:46.769> an<00:03:46.950> angle

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
multiple sheds and it's cut for an angle

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.310 
multiple sheds and it's cut for an angle
of<00:03:47.370> a<00:03:47.489> different<00:03:47.850> shed<00:03:48.090> so<00:03:48.810> the<00:03:48.989> quarter-inch

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
of a different shed so the quarter-inch

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.080 
of a different shed so the quarter-inch
reveal<00:03:49.830> starts<00:03:50.280> a<00:03:50.370> quarter-inch<00:03:50.730> on<00:03:51.000> the

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
reveal starts a quarter-inch on the

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.390 
reveal starts a quarter-inch on the
outside<00:03:51.480> and<00:03:51.780> it<00:03:51.930> continues<00:03:52.709> to<00:03:52.890> grow<00:03:53.040> as<00:03:53.280> it

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
outside and it continues to grow as it

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:54.830 
outside and it continues to grow as it
gets<00:03:53.550> toward<00:03:53.820> the<00:03:53.940> top<00:03:54.150> of<00:03:54.180> the<00:03:54.390> pitch<00:03:54.570> of<00:03:54.780> the

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
gets toward the top of the pitch of the

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.710 
gets toward the top of the pitch of the
inning<00:03:55.050> of<00:03:55.230> the<00:03:55.950> the<00:03:55.980> roofs<00:03:56.790> don't<00:03:57.510> worry

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
inning of the the roofs don't worry

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.770 
inning of the the roofs don't worry
about<00:03:57.810> that<00:03:58.110> I<00:03:58.290> would<00:03:58.980> use<00:03:59.160> screws<00:03:59.670> I<00:03:59.970> forgot

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
about that I would use screws I forgot

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.390 
about that I would use screws I forgot
drywall<00:04:01.200> screws<00:04:01.440> use<00:04:01.620> drywall<00:04:02.040> screws<00:04:02.280> that

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
drywall screws use drywall screws that

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.870 
drywall screws use drywall screws that
says<00:04:02.610> nail<00:04:02.850> em<00:04:03.000> in<00:04:04.130> and<00:04:05.130> I<00:04:05.160> nailed<00:04:05.459> those<00:04:05.670> in

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
says nail em in and I nailed those in

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.440 
says nail em in and I nailed those in
and<00:04:06.000> I<00:04:06.030> would<00:04:06.180> have<00:04:06.269> been<00:04:06.420> Sol<00:04:07.230> but<00:04:08.130> I<00:04:08.450> screwed

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
and I would have been Sol but I screwed

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.229 
and I would have been Sol but I screwed
those<00:04:09.660> in<00:04:09.900> so<00:04:10.170> I<00:04:10.200> feel<00:04:10.739> that<00:04:11.610> being<00:04:12.030> able<00:04:12.150> to

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
those in so I feel that being able to

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:13.940 
those in so I feel that being able to
back<00:04:12.450> those<00:04:12.630> screws<00:04:12.930> out<00:04:13.110> and<00:04:13.380> make<00:04:13.830> an

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
back those screws out and make an

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.150 
back those screws out and make an
adjustment<00:04:14.070> worked<00:04:14.880> in<00:04:15.030> my<00:04:15.180> favor<00:04:15.450> on<00:04:15.780> this

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
adjustment worked in my favor on this

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.229 
adjustment worked in my favor on this
so<00:04:16.820> anyways<00:04:17.709> it's<00:04:18.709> a<00:04:18.830> sturdy<00:04:19.100> shed<00:04:19.489> I've<00:04:20.000> got

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
so anyways it's a sturdy shed I've got

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.990 
so anyways it's a sturdy shed I've got
four<00:04:20.480> caissons<00:04:20.989> on<00:04:21.200> the<00:04:21.290> corner<00:04:21.700> and<00:04:22.700> as<00:04:22.880> you

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
four caissons on the corner and as you

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.980 
four caissons on the corner and as you
can<00:04:23.090> see<00:04:23.300> we<00:04:23.450> didn't<00:04:23.660> Center<00:04:24.020> that<00:04:24.820> I<00:04:25.820> also<00:04:26.660> ran

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
can see we didn't Center that I also ran

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.530 
can see we didn't Center that I also ran
railroad<00:04:27.560> ties<00:04:27.860> on<00:04:28.580> the<00:04:28.790> front<00:04:29.090> and<00:04:29.330> the<00:04:29.510> back

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
railroad ties on the front and the back

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:38.680 
railroad ties on the front and the back
and<00:04:30.490> then<00:04:31.490> I<00:04:31.520> did<00:04:31.880> a<00:04:31.910> retaining<00:04:32.480> wall<00:04:32.690> here<00:04:37.690> and

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
and then I did a retaining wall here and

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.780 
and then I did a retaining wall here and
as<00:04:39.500> you<00:04:39.650> can<00:04:39.830> see<00:04:40.040> I<00:04:40.070> haven't<00:04:40.430> completely

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
as you can see I haven't completely
