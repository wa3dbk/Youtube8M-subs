ago when that when I my horse flipped
and<00:00:27.990> threw<00:00:28.260> me<00:00:28.380> against<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.769> canyon<00:00:29.099> wall<00:00:29.250> I

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
and threw me against the canyon wall I

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.759 
and threw me against the canyon wall I
get<00:00:29.820> with<00:00:30.029> my<00:00:30.179> but<00:00:30.480> first<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:31.109> he<00:00:31.230> piled<00:00:31.650> right

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
get with my but first and he piled right

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.819 
get with my but first and he piled right
into<00:00:32.340> that<00:00:32.489> wall<00:00:32.809> but<00:00:33.809> I've<00:00:33.930> been<00:00:34.110> having<00:00:34.800> a

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
into that wall but I've been having a

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.380 
into that wall but I've been having a
lot<00:00:34.980> of<00:00:35.010> trouble<00:00:35.399> since<00:00:35.610> then<00:00:35.820> I<00:00:36.030> guess<00:00:36.180> that's

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
lot of trouble since then I guess that's

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.690 
lot of trouble since then I guess that's
whenever<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:37.739> just<00:00:37.950> progressively<00:00:38.399> gotten

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
whenever it just progressively gotten

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.040 
whenever it just progressively gotten
worse

nerve compression thankfully I had
already<00:01:20.369> had<00:01:20.729> this<00:01:21.000> working<00:01:21.479> relationship

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
already had this working relationship

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.760 
already had this working relationship
with<00:01:22.530> dr.<00:01:22.799> Martin<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.729> as<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.689> result<00:01:25.290> it<00:01:25.590> was

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
with dr. Martin and as a result it was

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.010 
with dr. Martin and as a result it was
clear<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.400> me<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:27.150> then<00:01:27.420> with<00:01:27.720> this

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
clear to me and then with this

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.010 
clear to me and then with this
Renaissance<00:01:28.470> robotic<00:01:29.250> program<00:01:29.700> that<00:01:30.420> he<00:01:30.750> was

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
Renaissance robotic program that he was

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.469 
Renaissance robotic program that he was
a<00:01:31.049> very<00:01:31.740> good<00:01:32.040> candidate<00:01:32.520> in<00:01:32.759> all<00:01:32.909> probability

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
a very good candidate in all probability

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.010 
a very good candidate in all probability
for<00:01:34.079> that<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:35.100> robot<00:01:35.460> itself<00:01:35.640> is<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.210> tool<00:01:36.720> that

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
for that the robot itself is a tool that

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.080 
for that the robot itself is a tool that
the<00:01:37.170> surgeon<00:01:37.590> uses<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.460> first<00:01:38.700> thing<00:01:38.850> that<00:01:39.000> we

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
the surgeon uses the first thing that we

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.080 
the surgeon uses the first thing that we
do<00:01:39.299> is<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.049> get<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.350> CT<00:01:40.680> scan<00:01:40.710> of<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.310> patients

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
do is to get a CT scan of the patients

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.870 
do is to get a CT scan of the patients
spine<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.200> then<00:01:43.890> we<00:01:44.130> take<00:01:44.369> that<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.640> we

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
spine and then we take that and we

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.840 
spine and then we take that and we
upload<00:01:45.390> it<00:01:45.420> into<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:46.229> Renaissance<00:01:46.850> planning

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
upload it into the Renaissance planning

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.170 
upload it into the Renaissance planning
software<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:49.130> we're<00:01:50.130> able<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.549> look<00:01:50.700> at<00:01:50.909> the

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
software and we're able to look at the

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.440 
software and we're able to look at the
the<00:01:51.210> bones<00:01:51.750> of<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.439> spine<00:01:52.530> in

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
the bones of the spine in

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.840 
the bones of the spine in
three<00:01:54.049> dimensional<00:01:54.590> views<00:01:54.920> and<00:01:55.310> in<00:01:55.640> two

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
three dimensional views and in two

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.510 
three dimensional views and in two
dimensional<00:01:56.270> views<00:01:56.570> it's<00:01:57.469> an<00:01:57.829> extra<00:01:58.159> safety

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
dimensional views it's an extra safety

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.529 
dimensional views it's an extra safety
factor<00:01:58.969> that<00:01:59.350> has<00:02:00.350> been<00:02:00.619> I<00:02:01.039> think<00:02:01.610> is<00:02:01.729> going<00:02:02.210> to

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:02.539 
factor that has been I think is going to

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:04.990 
factor that has been I think is going to
be<00:02:02.689> as<00:02:03.020> it<00:02:03.860> becomes<00:02:04.070> more<00:02:04.219> widely<00:02:04.640> known<00:02:04.820> a

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
be as it becomes more widely known a
