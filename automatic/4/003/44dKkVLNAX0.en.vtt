00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
called the nut so that's really

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.279 
called the nut so that's really
important<00:01:38.479> that<00:01:38.509> you<00:01:38.659> remember<00:01:38.840> that<00:01:38.990> one

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
this is the either ends of the strings

the nut at this end on the headstock and
the<00:01:46.939> other<00:01:47.090> end<00:01:47.329> of<00:01:47.450> it<00:01:47.539> is<00:01:47.600> the<00:01:47.929> bridge<00:01:48.369> which

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
the other end of it is the bridge which

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:50.980 
the other end of it is the bridge which
is<00:01:49.399> where<00:01:49.670> the<00:01:49.789> strings<00:01:50.060> kind<00:01:50.359> of<00:01:50.450> disappear

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
is where the strings kind of disappear

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.429 
is where the strings kind of disappear
into<00:01:51.020> the<00:01:51.289> body<00:01:51.499> of<00:01:51.649> the<00:01:51.740> guitar<00:01:53.200> so<00:01:54.200> remember

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
into the body of the guitar so remember

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:55.270 
into the body of the guitar so remember
that<00:01:54.560> it's<00:01:54.649> really<00:01:54.829> important<00:01:55.130> just<00:01:55.249> because

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
that it's really important just because

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.620 
that it's really important just because
we<00:01:55.490> use<00:01:55.640> that<00:01:55.789> quite<00:01:56.060> often<00:01:56.240> when<00:01:56.539> we're

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.460 
string and worry about that too much so

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.390 
string and worry about that too much so
this<00:02:38.300> thing<00:02:38.570> will<00:02:38.720> come<00:02:39.220> later

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
this thing will come later

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.300 
this thing will come later
okay<00:02:41.060> so<00:02:41.750> once<00:02:42.230> we<00:02:42.380> are<00:02:42.410> down<00:02:42.800> onto<00:02:43.070> the<00:02:43.190> actual

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
okay so once we are down onto the actual

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.530 
okay so once we are down onto the actual
body<00:02:43.730> of<00:02:43.940> the<00:02:44.060> guitar<00:02:44.180> now<00:02:46.000> an<00:02:47.000> acoustic

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
body of the guitar now an acoustic

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.990 
body of the guitar now an acoustic
guitar<00:02:47.570> we'll<00:02:48.560> just<00:02:48.770> have<00:02:48.980> the<00:02:49.550> hole<00:02:49.730> in<00:02:49.910> the

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
guitar we'll just have the hole in the

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.310 
guitar we'll just have the hole in the
middle<00:02:50.210> which<00:02:50.330> is<00:02:50.360> called<00:02:50.660> a<00:02:50.750> sound<00:02:51.050> hole

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
middle which is called a sound hole

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.190 
middle which is called a sound hole
probably<00:02:51.890> awful<00:02:52.190> when<00:02:52.310> the<00:02:52.400> sound<00:02:52.640> comes<00:02:52.880> out

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
probably awful when the sound comes out

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.900 
probably awful when the sound comes out
they<00:02:54.200> still<00:02:54.470> have<00:02:54.680> a<00:02:54.710> bridge<00:02:55.040> it<00:02:55.640> looks<00:02:55.820> a

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
they still have a bridge it looks a

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:56.860 
they still have a bridge it looks a
little<00:02:56.030> different<00:02:56.240> -<00:02:56.510> electric<00:02:56.840> guitar

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
little different - electric guitar

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.320 
little different - electric guitar
bridge<00:02:57.230> but<00:02:57.440> they<00:02:57.560> still<00:02:57.770> have<00:02:57.980> a<00:02:58.010> bridge<00:02:58.330> on

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
bridge but they still have a bridge on

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:00.970 
bridge but they still have a bridge on
the<00:02:59.480> electric<00:02:59.780> guitar<00:02:59.840> you'll<00:03:00.560> notice<00:03:00.860> these

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
the electric guitar you'll notice these

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.920 
the electric guitar you'll notice these
little<00:03:01.040> things<00:03:01.550> underneath<00:03:02.330> the<00:03:02.630> strings

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
little things underneath the strings

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
little things underneath the strings
there<00:03:03.520> yeah<00:03:04.520> these<00:03:04.730> are<00:03:04.910> called<00:03:05.090> pickups<00:03:05.950> and

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
there yeah these are called pickups and

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.590 
there yeah these are called pickups and
they<00:03:07.190> pick<00:03:07.550> up<00:03:07.700> the<00:03:07.850> sound<00:03:08.120> these<00:03:08.330> are<00:03:08.480> little

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
they pick up the sound these are little

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.660 
they pick up the sound these are little
magnets<00:03:09.170> and<00:03:09.350> as<00:03:09.440> the<00:03:09.620> string<00:03:09.890> was<00:03:10.250> rounded<00:03:10.550> it

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
magnets and as the string was rounded it

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.730 
magnets and as the string was rounded it
interrupts<00:03:11.210> the<00:03:11.330> magnetic<00:03:11.900> field<00:03:12.200> around<00:03:12.440> the

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:12.740 
interrupts the magnetic field around the

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.790 
interrupts the magnetic field around the
pickup<00:03:13.100> and<00:03:13.540> the<00:03:14.540> pickup<00:03:14.930> picks<00:03:15.350> up<00:03:15.530> the

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
pickup and the pickup picks up the

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.530 
pickup and the pickup picks up the
changes<00:03:16.220> in<00:03:16.370> the<00:03:16.460> magnetic<00:03:16.610> field<00:03:17.120> and<00:03:17.240> sends

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
changes in the magnetic field and sends

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.420 
changes in the magnetic field and sends
it<00:03:17.630> off<00:03:17.720> down<00:03:17.960> out<00:03:18.320> the<00:03:18.740> guitar<00:03:19.160> to<00:03:19.340> the

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
it off down out the guitar to the

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.080 
it off down out the guitar to the
amplifier<00:03:19.910> to<00:03:19.940> amplify<00:03:20.120> that<00:03:20.960> signal<00:03:21.880> if<00:03:22.880> you

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
amplifier to amplify that signal if you

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.230 
amplifier to amplify that signal if you
get<00:03:23.300> two<00:03:23.650> pickups<00:03:24.650> that<00:03:24.920> look<00:03:25.280> like<00:03:25.430> this<00:03:25.640> next

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:26.240 
get two pickups that look like this next

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.430 
get two pickups that look like this next
to<00:03:26.390> each<00:03:26.510> other<00:03:26.720> they're<00:03:26.930> probably<00:03:27.170> called

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
to each other they're probably called

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.190 
to each other they're probably called
humbucking<00:03:28.100> pickups<00:03:28.760> because<00:03:29.270> single<00:03:29.960> coil

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
humbucking pickups because single coil

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.900 
humbucking pickups because single coil
pickups<00:03:30.590> can<00:03:30.860> sometimes<00:03:31.310> be<00:03:31.550> a<00:03:31.580> bit<00:03:31.760> noisy

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
pickups can sometimes be a bit noisy

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.940 
pickups can sometimes be a bit noisy
when<00:03:32.570> you<00:03:32.660> stick<00:03:32.900> two<00:03:33.080> together<00:03:33.260> it<00:03:33.620> stops

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
when you stick two together it stops

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.100 
when you stick two together it stops
them<00:03:34.220> humming<00:03:34.610> so<00:03:35.090> you<00:03:35.150> get<00:03:35.330> this<00:03:35.420> humbucker

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
them humming so you get this humbucker

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:37.930 
them humming so you get this humbucker
and<00:03:36.410> they're<00:03:36.830> commonly<00:03:37.280> found<00:03:37.460> in<00:03:37.640> kind<00:03:37.880> of

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
and they're commonly found in kind of

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.820 
and they're commonly found in kind of

you're a beginner guitar player you

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:58.750 
you're a beginner guitar player you
probably<00:03:57.980> don't<00:03:58.160> want<00:03:58.310> to<00:03:58.340> be<00:03:58.400> mucking<00:03:58.610> around

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
probably don't want to be mucking around

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.010 
probably don't want to be mucking around
with<00:03:58.970> that<00:03:59.030> and<00:03:59.210> just<00:03:59.330> make<00:03:59.420> you<00:03:59.630> Targa

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:00.020 
with that and just make you Targa

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.810 
with that and just make you Targa
attitude<00:04:00.410> so<00:04:00.709> I'd<00:04:01.100> leave<00:04:01.310> that<00:04:01.520> out<00:04:01.670> of<00:04:01.760> the

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:01.820 
attitude so I'd leave that out of the

attitude so I'd leave that out of the
way<00:04:01.970> if<00:04:02.180> I<00:04:02.300> was<00:04:02.450> you<00:04:02.920> you<00:04:03.920> probably<00:04:04.100> have<00:04:04.400> a

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
way if I was you you probably have a

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:05.890 
way if I was you you probably have a
couple<00:04:04.640> of<00:04:04.880> knobs<00:04:05.060> if<00:04:05.270> you've<00:04:05.540> got<00:04:05.780> an

couple of knobs if you've got an

likely for a beginner you just want to

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.980 
likely for a beginner you just want to
make<00:04:13.280> sure<00:04:13.310> that<00:04:13.610> they're<00:04:13.790> all<00:04:14.000> up<00:04:14.360> all<00:04:14.630> of<00:04:14.900> the
