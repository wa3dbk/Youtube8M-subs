00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
that I'm so excited about is we can do

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.049 
that I'm so excited about is we can do
angled<00:00:30.810> counters<00:00:31.320> like<00:00:31.529> this<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.130> the

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
angled counters like this and the

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.000 
angled counters like this and the
l-shaped<00:00:35.329> sofas<00:00:36.329> you<00:00:36.540> can<00:00:37.200> also<00:00:37.320> do<00:00:37.590> some<00:00:37.800> bunk

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
l-shaped sofas you can also do some bunk

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.470 
l-shaped sofas you can also do some bunk
beds<00:00:38.100> like<00:00:38.430> this<00:00:38.610> but<00:00:38.790> I<00:00:38.820> highly<00:00:39.059> doubt<00:00:39.329> the

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
beds like this but I highly doubt the

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.920 
beds like this but I highly doubt the
sims<00:00:39.690> will<00:00:39.780> be<00:00:39.930> able<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.200> use<00:00:40.379> them<00:00:41.780> but<00:00:42.780> so

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
sims will be able to use them but so

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.709 
sims will be able to use them but so
what<00:00:43.050> you<00:00:43.140> got<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.379> do<00:00:43.730> use<00:00:44.730> ctrl<00:00:45.120> shift<00:00:45.149> C<00:00:45.570> and

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
what you got to do use ctrl shift C and

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:54.200 
what you got to do use ctrl shift C and
then<00:00:45.840> you<00:00:45.870> do<00:00:46.079> BB<00:00:46.620> dot<00:00:47.570> move<00:00:48.570> objects<00:00:51.770> and<00:00:53.210> I

what you do is you hold the Alt key and

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:13.140 
what you do is you hold the Alt key and
you<00:02:07.350> can<00:02:07.649> move<00:02:07.950> it<00:02:08.160> in<00:02:08.340> so<00:02:08.729> it<00:02:08.879> gets<00:02:09.209> exact<00:02:09.869> Oh

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.690 

just<00:02:13.540> being<00:02:13.750> a<00:02:13.810> little<00:02:13.930> finicky<00:02:14.290> but<00:02:14.700> you'll

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
just being a little finicky but you'll

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.759 
just being a little finicky but you'll
be<00:02:15.730> able<00:02:15.940> to<00:02:16.090> find<00:02:16.269> the<00:02:16.480> spot<00:02:16.750> and<00:02:19.590> right<00:02:20.590> there

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
be able to find the spot and right there

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:22.890 
be able to find the spot and right there
so<00:02:21.760> you<00:02:21.849> can<00:02:22.030> do<00:02:22.150> some<00:02:22.450> pretty<00:02:22.599> cool<00:02:22.840> stuff
