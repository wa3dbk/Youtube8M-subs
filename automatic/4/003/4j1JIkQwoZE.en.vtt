00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:04.350
 Hello and welcome to the dog center Macheda the place for 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:05.430
 People with a dog 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.049
 brand new on our homepage we have some training video for you 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:12.840
 put together where you can study this once we can 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.840
 I wish you a lot of fun while learning and copying with your dog 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.120
 During handshake training the dog should learn your hand 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.310
 to touch the nose on a specific command and later 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.310
 to leave the nose there too until you cancel the command 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.880
 In the following we want to show you how it works 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.360
 first, the hand becomes 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.760
 To keep the dog's nose most dogs will be at it right away 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.130
 sniffing everybody could be fair that there is something to find in the hand 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.440
 just at this moment far way and reward 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.210
 Betting meaningful not to feed by hand which one the dog also before the 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.210
 Nose holds because the dog could become their animals otherwise 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.990
 The first step worked well, that means as soon as you put your hand back 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.610
 cheers 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.970
 Your dog tries to drill it with his nose and on the fat 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.460
 You can start waiting for Rolf 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.970
 keep the hand always a little way away so that the dog has a small 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.030
 Must cover the distance to touch the hand with the nose 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.060
 In the next step, we can start with it 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.060
 to track the dog's hand 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.000
 or he tries to make the dog take a little jump here must Lego 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.580
 but still thinking about what I actually wanted from her then 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.210
 I put my hand back a bit and it works 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.210
 again 

00:02:14.249 --> 00:02:17.249
 The different hand production can be varied from now on 

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:22.410
 Dolly Buster is the culprit and she understands what I want from her 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.320
 is it really that bad in this step when I'm out of my hand too? 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.880
 sued those who had previously touch had not irritate Lego thereby 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.490
 Especially beginners dog should not take this step though 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.319
 do 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.799
 The same for all other exercises must be a command for this behavior 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:40.329
 be introduced 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:44.340
 When introducing a command, you always give the command just before the dog 

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:47.339
 begins to show the desired behavior 

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:56.159
 also when introducing the command will be different hand production 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:59.159
 and movement introduced 

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:05.049
 If the dog has understood this step too, it could move on to the next step 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:09.019
 The dog has to learn to touch the hand a bit longer 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:12.019
 before the click comes 

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:23.059
 Lego always gets lucky only when they nose my hand 

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:26.059
 does not stop when they nudge 

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:41.749
 At times you can see very nice here, the Lego a bit irritated 11 

00:03:41.749 --> 00:03:45.569
 I'm wondering why they do not give a hand to guide the hand 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:46.629
 got 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:49.930
 but that can not be confused about ancient times and is more experienced 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.489
 and immediately tries to continue offering other behaviors 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:56.489
 and to get back to the desired war 

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:06.549
 also different body position must be considered at the Kyburg 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:10.809
 will be here with Lego first arriving on foot and is a little bit 

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:13.769
 irritated that I now also want her to touch his hand 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:16.769
 but here too, most of them are the KYB and with flying colors 

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:21.499
 What Lego has shown here in just under four minutes is of course the structure 

00:04:21.499 --> 00:04:23.020
 of several days 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.360
 It is important in small workouts throughout the day 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.020
 so the dog has enough time in between to learn it 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.150
 also save 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.139
 We thank you for watching and of course we hope for suggestions 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:38.529
 could give what can be worked out with dog and kicker 

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:42.039
