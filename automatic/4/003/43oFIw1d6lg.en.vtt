repeat<00:01:25.970> these<00:01:26.119> steps<00:01:26.299> to<00:01:26.720> make<00:01:26.750> more<00:01:27.110> petals

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
repeat these steps to make more petals

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:42.620

on<00:01:27.680> various<00:01:28.100> sizes

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.600 

now<00:01:43.380> we're<00:01:43.740> going<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:43.950> start<00:01:44.250> adding<00:01:44.400> the

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
now we're going to start adding the

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.179 
now we're going to start adding the
petals<00:01:44.909> one<00:01:45.180> by<00:01:45.360> one<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.869> base<00:01:46.049> rock<00:01:47.009> the

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
petals one by one to the base rock the

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.160 
petals one by one to the base rock the
petals<00:01:47.549> around<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:48.060> base<00:01:48.210> making<00:01:48.780> sure<00:01:48.990> to

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
petals around the base making sure to

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.340 
petals around the base making sure to
overlap<00:01:49.320> them<00:01:49.890> in<00:01:50.450> the<00:01:51.450> center<00:01:51.690> of<00:01:51.840> peonies

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
overlap them in the center of peonies

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.410 
overlap them in the center of peonies
their<00:01:52.590> petals<00:01:52.799> curl<00:01:53.220> inward<00:01:53.729> so<00:01:54.210> make<00:01:54.390> sure

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
their petals curl inward so make sure

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.899 
their petals curl inward so make sure
you<00:01:54.750> imitate<00:01:55.170> that<00:01:55.380> it'll<00:01:56.130> be<00:01:56.250> easier<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.670> use

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
you imitate that it'll be easier to use

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.760 
you imitate that it'll be easier to use
smaller<00:01:57.270> petals<00:01:57.659> in<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.869> center<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.590> then

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
smaller petals in the center and then

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.859 
smaller petals in the center and then
gradually<00:01:59.280> add<00:01:59.430> larger<00:01:59.940> petals<00:02:00.299> as<00:02:00.479> you<00:02:00.659> grow

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
gradually add larger petals as you grow

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:10.169 
gradually add larger petals as you grow
outwards

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.059 

the<00:02:10.629> petals<00:02:10.929> can<00:02:11.140> also<00:02:11.349> start<00:02:11.709> opening

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
the petals can also start opening

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:13.770 
the petals can also start opening
outwards<00:02:12.519> as<00:02:12.760> you<00:02:12.879> get<00:02:13.060> farther<00:02:13.329> from<00:02:13.599> the

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
outwards as you get farther from the

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.449 
outwards as you get farther from the
center<00:02:14.140> and<00:02:14.379> this<00:02:14.739> hole<00:02:14.920> looks<00:02:15.129> like<00:02:15.280> your

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
center and this hole looks like your

00:02:15.459 --> 00:03:11.250 
center and this hole looks like your
peony<00:02:15.849> is<00:02:16.000> blooming

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.690 

to<00:03:12.260> make<00:03:12.410> your<00:03:12.530> peony<00:03:12.950> look<00:03:13.160> a<00:03:13.280> bit<00:03:13.490> more

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
to make your peony look a bit more

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.760 
to make your peony look a bit more
realistic<00:03:14.090> I'm<00:03:14.540> just<00:03:14.870> going<00:03:15.110> in<00:03:15.320> with<00:03:15.650> an

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:15.770 
realistic I'm just going in with an

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.310 
realistic I'm just going in with an
exacto<00:03:16.280> knife<00:03:16.490> and<00:03:16.760> very<00:03:17.060> gently<00:03:17.480> indenting<00:03:18.230> a

exacto knife and very gently indenting a

exacto knife and very gently indenting a
couple<00:03:18.710> of<00:03:18.800> the<00:03:18.950> outside<00:03:19.310> petals

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
couple of the outside petals

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:32.630 
couple of the outside petals
this<00:03:20.330> gives<00:03:20.570> the<00:03:20.720> peony<00:03:21.140> a<00:03:21.170> bit<00:03:21.500> more<00:03:21.710> texture

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
carefully cut off the excess and you'll

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:49.600 
carefully cut off the excess and you'll
