00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.580
 Hi everyone of the world rubber market 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.160
 This theme is 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.260
 I think that I would like to explain the features of the two types of Tsutsuki 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.750
 It's a story of what two kinds of tsutsuki are 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.810
 The first one is how to put the racket vertically 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.100
 This is pretty much among young people 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.250
 It is the way of entry of the mainstream Tsutsuki enters vertically 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:33.040
 Another way is to put the racket sideways 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.250
 If this method also goes to a local convention 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.760
 Even good people put the racket from the side 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.660
 If you can see that you are playing 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.210
 I think, but which one is better 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.360
 What if I put Tsuttsuki 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.129
 You should be consulted for any trouble 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.960
 There are so many, so firmly 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.920
 I think that I want to explain because there is a benefit 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.539
 First of all, now the mainstream racket 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:05.690
 It is a way to put it vertically 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.940
 This really suits modern table tennis today 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.119
 It will be the way of Tsutsuki. 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:15.659
 Fast on the pitch with both hands 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.350
 There is a lot of saying that you attack 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.900
 It will not be a big back swing by putting it vertically 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.650
 Be able to squeeze in a small swing 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.920
 I can do it so it's so fast 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.130
 I can go back because I can go back quickly 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.939
 It will be in the form of waiting for the next two hands 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:38.700
 It is also a back swing by putting it vertically 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.850
 Because it becomes small, it makes a quick hit point 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.531
 It also makes it easier 

00:01:45.531 --> 00:01:48.220
 It is one of the merits that it is possible to have a quick hit point 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.490
 Other receive eg with stop etc 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.390
 It can be difficult to understand 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.909
 It also has the effect of not giving time to the other party 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:57.770
 Such places put in this vertical 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:04.329
 It will be the point of Tsutsuki Now put the racket sideways 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:08.619
 It is tsutsuki As a feature of this tsutsuki 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.590
 Because I can pull backswing a little 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.910
 The swing width becomes large and it is easy to apply strong rotation 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.739
 It is the first feature Anyway, it is a game of rotation amount 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.640
 Rather than a rally after that 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.980
 I can not make a mistake or hit my opponent 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.920
 A person who wants to play 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.390
 It is recommended because it is recommended 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.470
 For Tsutsuki, cut it 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.090
 Let the other party return with Tsutsuki and then bring it 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.790
 I wonder if it's for players with a fairly large deployment 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.610
 I think of a veteran pen folder 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:44.940
 Even if you are looking at a player, the ball that came back 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.860
 I cut it from the side and cut it firmly 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.920
 In the place where the other party did not hit but it was 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.560
 Development that seems to go around and say Dokan 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.160
 Because there are so many, put from this side 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.510
 Cut it firmly and bring it into a big development 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.080
 This is the recommended method 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.430
 So this Tsuzuki is roughly divided into two types 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.040
 I have a Tsutsuki but I have both Tsutsuki 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.959
 If you can practice it based on the fact that it is appropriate 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.100
 I think that it is good, these two kinds of Tsutsuzuki 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.769
 Please try to see
