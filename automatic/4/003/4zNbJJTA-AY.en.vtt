a twenty dollar bag from Amazon and the

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.330 
a twenty dollar bag from Amazon and the
backpack<00:01:14.640> was<00:01:15.030> an<00:01:15.149> ancient<00:01:15.590> Swiss<00:01:16.590> bag<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.310> I

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
backpack was an ancient Swiss bag that I

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.490 
backpack was an ancient Swiss bag that I
had<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.120> was<00:01:18.210> able<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.570> use<00:01:18.900> each<00:01:19.140> of<00:01:19.380> them

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
had and I was able to use each of them

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.530 
had and I was able to use each of them
on<00:01:19.740> completely<00:01:20.130> different<00:01:20.280> shoots<00:01:20.760> with<00:01:21.390> the

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
on completely different shoots with the

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.440 
on completely different shoots with the
same<00:01:21.840> system<00:01:22.770> so<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.610> way<00:01:23.760> this<00:01:23.909> works<00:01:24.240> is

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
same system so the way this works is

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.539 
same system so the way this works is
instead<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:24.960> having<00:01:25.110> dividers<00:01:26.040> in<00:01:26.190> your<00:01:26.310> bags

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
instead of having dividers in your bags

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.910 
instead of having dividers in your bags
and<00:01:27.000> placing<00:01:27.659> things<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.229> then<00:01:28.650> you<00:01:28.710> have<00:01:28.799> to

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
and placing things and then you have to

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.260 
and placing things and then you have to
move<00:01:29.100> it<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.369> completely<00:01:29.790> set<00:01:30.000> up<00:01:30.150> a

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
move it and completely set up a

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.390 
move it and completely set up a
different<00:01:30.420> you<00:01:31.020> know<00:01:31.140> packing<00:01:31.740> solution<00:01:32.190> on<00:01:32.369> a

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
different you know packing solution on a

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.580 
different you know packing solution on a
different<00:01:32.729> bag<00:01:32.880> you<00:01:33.510> have<00:01:33.659> all<00:01:33.900> your<00:01:34.049> gear<00:01:34.409> in

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
different bag you have all your gear in

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.160 
different bag you have all your gear in
smaller<00:01:35.420> compartments<00:01:36.420> that<00:01:36.600> can<00:01:36.869> move

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
smaller compartments that can move

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.469 
smaller compartments that can move
between<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.710> bags<00:01:37.920> now<00:01:38.640> I'm<00:01:38.880> gonna<00:01:39.000> be<00:01:39.210> using

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
between the bags now I'm gonna be using

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.390 
between the bags now I'm gonna be using
three<00:01:39.930> different<00:01:40.049> accessories<00:01:40.740> or<00:01:41.010> different

three different accessories or different
packing<00:01:42.210> solutions<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:43.439> will<00:01:43.680> work<00:01:43.740> with

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
packing solutions that will work with

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.830 
packing solutions that will work with
any<00:01:44.159> bag<00:01:44.580> so<00:01:44.970> let's<00:01:45.119> go<00:01:45.240> ahead<00:01:45.299> and<00:01:45.479> jump<00:01:45.689> into

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
any bag so let's go ahead and jump into

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.410 
any bag so let's go ahead and jump into
those<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.229> first<00:01:46.530> one<00:01:46.740> is<00:01:46.950> donkey<00:01:47.880> bags<00:01:48.090> I've

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
those the first one is donkey bags I've

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.210 
those the first one is donkey bags I've
talked<00:01:48.689> about<00:01:48.840> these<00:01:49.049> in<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.260> past<00:01:49.500> these<00:01:50.040> are

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
talked about these in the past these are

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.740 
talked about these in the past these are
amazing<00:01:50.580> they<00:01:50.880> come<00:01:51.060> in<00:01:51.180> two<00:01:51.330> different<00:01:51.450> sizes

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
amazing they come in two different sizes

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.010 
amazing they come in two different sizes
this<00:01:52.200> is<00:01:52.260> the<00:01:52.530> larger<00:01:52.950> 19<00:01:53.340> by<00:01:53.520> 19<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:54.510> it's

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
this is the larger 19 by 19 and it's

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.179 
this is the larger 19 by 19 and it's
just<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.380> very<00:01:55.619> soft<00:01:56.420> protective<00:01:58.189> wrap

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
just a very soft protective wrap

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.340 
just a very soft protective wrap
essentially<00:01:59.970> so<00:02:00.509> it<00:02:00.659> just<00:02:00.810> opens<00:02:01.049> up<00:02:01.200> like

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
essentially so it just opens up like

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.929 
essentially so it just opens up like
this<00:02:02.570> got<00:02:03.570> black<00:02:03.869> felt<00:02:04.530> on<00:02:04.710> one<00:02:04.890> side<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.460> then

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
this got black felt on one side and then

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.940 
this got black felt on one side and then
I<00:02:06.030> think<00:02:06.210> this<00:02:06.330> is<00:02:06.390> a<00:02:06.750> nylon<00:02:07.290> it's<00:02:07.650> a<00:02:07.770> non

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
I think this is a nylon it's a non

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.039 
I think this is a nylon it's a non
scratch<00:02:08.369> so<00:02:08.670> it'll<00:02:08.789> work<00:02:08.939> with<00:02:09.090> anything

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:10.049 
scratch so it'll work with anything

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:13.190 
scratch so it'll work with anything
really<00:02:10.379> and<00:02:10.709> for<00:02:11.549> this<00:02:11.700> I<00:02:11.909> use<00:02:12.360> I<00:02:12.599> use<00:02:12.840> it<00:02:13.049> for

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
really and for this I use I use it for

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.729 
really and for this I use I use it for
everything<00:02:13.349> I<00:02:13.829> put<00:02:14.069> cameras<00:02:14.430> in<00:02:14.459> here<00:02:14.760> lenses

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
everything I put cameras in here lenses

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:18.050 
everything I put cameras in here lenses
monitors<00:02:16.739> but<00:02:17.159> for<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.430> two<00:02:17.579> shoots<00:02:17.819> that<00:02:18.030> I

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
monitors but for the two shoots that I

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.420 
monitors but for the two shoots that I
was<00:02:18.269> on<00:02:18.390> I<00:02:18.599> was<00:02:18.750> using<00:02:18.959> this<00:02:19.260> for<00:02:19.590> my<00:02:19.769> camera<00:02:20.099> so

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
was on I was using this for my camera so

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.160 
was on I was using this for my camera so
what<00:02:20.550> I<00:02:20.580> would<00:02:20.700> do<00:02:20.940> and<00:02:21.330> we'll<00:02:21.810> show<00:02:21.989> you<00:02:22.020> a

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
what I would do and we'll show you a

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.350 
what I would do and we'll show you a
much<00:02:22.920> more<00:02:22.980> detailed<00:02:23.130> shot<00:02:23.670> here<00:02:23.940> is

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
much more detailed shot here is

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.150 
much more detailed shot here is
but<00:02:24.630> I<00:02:24.660> would<00:02:24.810> do<00:02:24.900> something<00:02:25.230> like<00:02:25.260> this<00:02:25.410> so

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
but I would do something like this so

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.250 
but I would do something like this so
the<00:02:26.250> bottom<00:02:26.610> is<00:02:26.760> protected<00:02:27.390> and<00:02:27.750> I<00:02:27.960> would<00:02:28.080> just

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
the bottom is protected and I would just

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.690 
the bottom is protected and I would just
slide<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.620> camera<00:02:28.830> in<00:02:29.100> here<00:02:29.280> and<00:02:29.460> this<00:02:29.520> could

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
slide the camera in here and this could

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.140 
slide the camera in here and this could
just<00:02:29.880> live<00:02:30.060> in<00:02:30.180> a<00:02:30.240> bag<00:02:30.450> you<00:02:30.690> can<00:02:30.840> even<00:02:30.960> tuck<00:02:31.740> in

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
just live in a bag you can even tuck in

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.460 
just live in a bag you can even tuck in
the<00:02:33.150> top<00:02:33.390> flap<00:02:33.690> so<00:02:33.870> you<00:02:33.960> have<00:02:34.080> this<00:02:34.170> really

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
the top flap so you have this really

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.890 
the top flap so you have this really
nice<00:02:34.800> little<00:02:35.390> compartment<00:02:36.390> for<00:02:36.540> your<00:02:36.570> camera

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
nice little compartment for your camera

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.290 
nice little compartment for your camera
so<00:02:37.380> this<00:02:37.650> is<00:02:37.830> perfect<00:02:38.460> for<00:02:38.520> our<00:02:38.700> camera<00:02:39.150> and

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
so this is perfect for our camera and

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.780 
so this is perfect for our camera and
one<00:02:39.510> lens<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:40.320> next<00:02:40.560> solution<00:02:40.950> is<00:02:41.130> these<00:02:41.370> lens

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
one lens the next solution is these lens

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.300 
one lens the next solution is these lens
cups<00:02:42.210> from<00:02:42.630> porter<00:02:43.110> brace<00:02:43.260> so<00:02:43.890> they<00:02:44.010> come<00:02:44.160> in<00:02:44.250> a

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
cups from porter brace so they come in a

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.730 
cups from porter brace so they come in a
bunch<00:02:44.520> of<00:02:44.610> different<00:02:44.910> sizes<00:02:45.740> fantastic

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
bunch of different sizes fantastic

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.620 
bunch of different sizes fantastic
little<00:02:46.950> tools<00:02:47.250> I<00:02:47.610> can't<00:02:47.850> tell<00:02:48.090> you<00:02:48.180> how<00:02:48.390> many

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
little tools I can't tell you how many

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.570 
little tools I can't tell you how many
of<00:02:48.780> these<00:02:48.900> I<00:02:48.960> have<00:02:49.650> and<00:02:49.800> how<00:02:49.890> many<00:02:50.130> of<00:02:50.280> them<00:02:50.400> I

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
of these I have and how many of them I

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.970 
of these I have and how many of them I
use<00:02:50.880> so<00:02:51.570> obviously<00:02:52.260> as<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.650> name<00:02:52.680> suggests

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980

almost<00:02:55.560> a<00:02:55.830> cylinder<00:02:56.310> and<00:02:56.850> they<00:02:57.090> have<00:02:57.209> a<00:02:57.240> little

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
almost a cylinder and they have a little

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.690 
almost a cylinder and they have a little
zippered<00:02:58.170> flap<00:02:58.530> on<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:58.740> top<00:02:58.800> which<00:02:59.160> is<00:02:59.190> clear

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
zippered flap on the top which is clear

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.400 
zippered flap on the top which is clear
I<00:02:59.880> like<00:03:00.090> to<00:03:00.209> stick<00:03:00.480> a<00:03:00.690> little<00:03:00.870> bit<00:03:01.080> of<00:03:01.230> gaff

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
I like to stick a little bit of gaff

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.070 
I like to stick a little bit of gaff
tape<00:03:01.440> so<00:03:02.370> I<00:03:02.400> can<00:03:02.670> see<00:03:02.850> what<00:03:03.060> lens<00:03:03.300> I<00:03:03.420> have<00:03:03.630> and

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
tape so I can see what lens I have and

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.080 
tape so I can see what lens I have and
two<00:03:04.890> different<00:03:05.190> sizes<00:03:05.370> actually<00:03:05.910> there's<00:03:06.030> a

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
two different sizes actually there's a

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.460 
two different sizes actually there's a
ton<00:03:06.300> of<00:03:06.330> different<00:03:06.480> sizes<00:03:06.959> but<00:03:07.050> these<00:03:07.170> are<00:03:07.350> the

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
ton of different sizes but these are the

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.620 
ton of different sizes but these are the
the<00:03:07.830> two<00:03:08.010> that<00:03:08.130> I<00:03:08.190> have<00:03:08.489> so<00:03:09.090> a<00:03:09.120> longer<00:03:09.480> one<00:03:09.570> for

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
the two that I have so a longer one for

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.540 
the two that I have so a longer one for
larger<00:03:10.020> lenses<00:03:10.440> and<00:03:10.709> obviously<00:03:11.070> a<00:03:11.160> smaller

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
larger lenses and obviously a smaller

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.210 
larger lenses and obviously a smaller
one<00:03:11.760> so<00:03:12.090> these<00:03:12.600> I<00:03:12.810> would<00:03:12.870> use<00:03:13.080> for<00:03:13.110> lenses<00:03:13.680> so<00:03:14.190> I

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
one so these I would use for lenses so I

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.610 
one so these I would use for lenses so I
could<00:03:14.400> pack<00:03:14.670> three<00:03:15.360> of<00:03:15.480> these<00:03:15.600> in<00:03:15.930> my<00:03:16.200> camera

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
could pack three of these in my camera

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:17.930 
could pack three of these in my camera
and<00:03:16.680> some<00:03:16.920> other<00:03:17.040> stuff<00:03:17.340> in<00:03:17.550> the<00:03:17.790> backpack

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
and some other stuff in the backpack

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.900 
and some other stuff in the backpack
we're<00:03:18.420> in<00:03:18.540> this<00:03:18.720> messenger<00:03:19.140> bag<00:03:19.350> and<00:03:19.770> I<00:03:20.640> also

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
we're in this messenger bag and I also

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.699 
we're in this messenger bag and I also
use<00:03:21.180> these<00:03:21.300> for<00:03:21.570> a<00:03:21.750> bunch<00:03:22.080> of<00:03:22.140> other<00:03:22.260> stuff<00:03:22.560> I
