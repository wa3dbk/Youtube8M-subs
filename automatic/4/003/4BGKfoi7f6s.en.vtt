00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.040
 the video about the video 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.880
 spectacular and today I'm going to make a 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:12.300
 boxing yoga microphone ht 81 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.450
 this is the one-way microphone then 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.970
 he makes the audio capture a year well 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.920
 forward because it is positioned and 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.109
 it can override the sounds that 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.880
 are coming from the sides 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.490
 It's this microphone that I found 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.619
 week is you can see that the box is 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.179
 somewhat damaged because it was a last resort 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.790
 I had in store 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.559
 so it's like I 'm not going to use the box 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:40.160
 I did not care since his content 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:44.219
 it's ok, that microphone it comes 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:48.539
 packed with a kind of cheese as well 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.879
 It's that simple and inside you have a 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:55.199
 foam holder for you to store the 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:58.170
 microphone safely in a new 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.940
 instructions belts that pass the 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.219
 main features of the microphone 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.080
 talks about the need for food 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:08.400
 etc and comes a dose in Portuguese 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.439
 even in the case of this one came to 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.479
 with error saying that his capture is 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.420
 only up to 1,600 indirect 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:19.439
 in fact it goes from 100 hertz up to 16 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:24.180
 thousand meters with 610 here and in his 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:32.180
 microphone or it already comes with a 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:34.500
 type xlr 10 with a mono p2 adapter 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.240
 because it comes with this adapter that 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.970
 generally who buy this kind of 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.509
 microphone is wanting to use a 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:45.869
 DSLR camera that is the person uses 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:49.079
 camera so you can capture the 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.939
 audio and video and uses this microphone 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:58.079
 to improve audio quality 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:02:01.049
 captured in the gay kit also a screen that 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:03.570
 this filter tells a benefit then 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.090
 you will be using the microphone a local 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.340
 that has wind or even some types of 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.640
 low frequency noise only that it 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:15.040
 can cancel or at least attenuate 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:19.630
 it comes with a personal support call 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:22.960
 caching to use the tripod 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:25.420
 court a microphone stand 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:29.200
 he has that thread the pattern of 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.910
 microphone stand and how it is a 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.790
 product for those who are 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.920
 using a digital camera 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.830
 it comes with this kind of pedestal here 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.770
 you can send in your paw 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.660
 flash or our patrol you use the 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.520
 camera blood 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.440
 so if it's cool that it's really useful that you 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.200
 will not make an adjustment to be able to 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:03:02.050
 use this microphone in your camera and 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:03:04.720
 a microphone if he has these 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:07.060
 Side ladies and audio capture 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.590
 made by the front 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.390
 I do not know if it's going to be legal to see that 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.180
 space is small right? 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.940
 the incoming connection is 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:20.740
 standard xlr some people call serve 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:23.800
 of carol against the canon and in the case of 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:26.620
 this microphone here because it is condenser 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:30.370
 he needs power 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:34.480
 So that you microphone of game I stayed 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:37.090
 here he has a place to put you 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.180
 a pile like ah that little island 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:42.370
 conventional is what many people do not 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.890
 knows about that microphone that you do not 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.790
 must necessarily use and it 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.890
 to function 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.030
 if you are using your camera 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.459
 digital 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:54.160
 you will need to 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.989
 because your camera does not have 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.870
 Fao power Paulo 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:01.750
 but if you are using a 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.880
 Recorder of this type has a sound desk 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:07.330
 What is phantom power? 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:12.130
 you can leave the wireless microphone 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:16.080
 here 's how it comes and then you go 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:17.810
 need a cable that is standard xlr 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:19.790
 Praxe he is 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.370
 It's different from here and there you are. 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.380
 activating the phantom power this microphone 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.510
 it will work normally when 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.280
 I was in a pile you did not have 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.980
 phantom power then yes you have to 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:34.250
 to use a stack for it to function is to 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:36.919
 here is this setting button that he 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:39.560
 has three rock modes when you are 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:42.740
 with the microphone off offline 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:44.660
 the normal is paid when you want to capture 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.919
 the audio that is closest to the 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.450
 microphone 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:49.940
 so for example let's suppose you 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:52.460
 want to make a small narration 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:55.880
 using this microphone it is very 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.650
 good for stories to for voiceover 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.450
 but you need to break a branch of that 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.590
 type you put it here in normal mode 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:05.530
 that it will capture the closest audio 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:09.590
 of the place of capture of him that is the 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:12.169
 and in tele mode it will direct this 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:15.229
 capture angle for you to get 

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:16.460
 capture the audio farthest from the 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:18.350
 microphone 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:21.139
 usually the staff who use it 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:24.169
 this microphone here uses or above 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:25.880
 camera or use it to do that 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:29.120
 type of butt microphone where you 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:31.820
 put a stick and you lay is the 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.620
 microphone out of the scene by capturing audio from 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.390
 people are talking there the ambient sound 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.940
 something like that 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:39.650
 So, this video was just the same. 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:41.510
 to make a bike without showing what 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.669
 comes in the kit 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:45.890
 if you have any questions regarding 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:48.380
 to this microphone or to the 

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:50.360
 audio capture something like that you 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.190
 can you ask me for the comments ? 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.650
 respond as soon as possible 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:56.780
 and I'll also ask to sign up 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:59.600

 new videos and if you liked the 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:05.770
 video you click and did not like
