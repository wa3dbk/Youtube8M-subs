00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
feature that lets you send small amounts

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.700 
feature that lets you send small amounts
of<00:00:23.160> data<00:00:23.400> so<00:00:23.789> web<00:00:24.090> links<00:00:24.420> or<00:00:24.539> contacts<00:00:24.960> from

of data so web links or contacts from

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.109 
of data so web links or contacts from
one<00:00:25.890> device<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.400> other<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.910> this<00:00:27.000> has

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
one device to the other and this has

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.339 
one device to the other and this has
actually<00:00:27.210> been<00:00:27.390> expanded<00:00:27.840> quite<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:28.019> bit<00:00:28.230> in

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
actually been expanded quite a bit in

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.230 
actually been expanded quite a bit in
jelly<00:00:28.560> bean<00:00:28.769> so<00:00:29.340> what<00:00:29.460> you<00:00:29.550> can<00:00:29.670> now<00:00:29.760> do<00:00:29.820> is

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
jelly bean so what you can now do is

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.840 
jelly bean so what you can now do is
transfer<00:00:31.160> content<00:00:32.160> from<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.399> gallery<00:00:32.730> app

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
transfer content from the gallery app

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.330 
transfer content from the gallery app
between<00:00:33.570> devices<00:00:34.050> so<00:00:34.230> photos<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:34.829> videos<00:00:35.100> and

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
between devices so photos and videos and

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.490 
between devices so photos and videos and
the<00:00:35.760> way<00:00:35.850> you<00:00:35.910> do<00:00:36.030> that<00:00:36.149> is<00:00:36.450> you<00:00:36.840> just<00:00:37.050> find<00:00:37.469> the

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
the way you do that is you just find the

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.709 
the way you do that is you just find the
file<00:00:37.710> that<00:00:37.829> you<00:00:37.920> want<00:00:37.950> then<00:00:38.910> hold<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.600> two

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
file that you want then hold the two

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.290 
file that you want then hold the two
devices<00:00:39.989> back-to-back<00:00:40.950> as<00:00:41.100> usual<00:00:41.460> tap<00:00:42.210> the

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
devices back-to-back as usual tap the

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.660 
devices back-to-back as usual tap the
screen<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.620> second<00:00:43.920> device<00:00:44.160> you'll<00:00:44.460> get

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
screen and the second device you'll get

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.240 
screen and the second device you'll get
an<00:00:44.969> incoming<00:00:45.300> beam<00:00:45.539> notification<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.829> if<00:00:47.010> we

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
an incoming beam notification and if we

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.650 
an incoming beam notification and if we
put<00:00:47.610> this<00:00:47.700> back<00:00:47.910> we<00:00:48.120> can<00:00:48.270> see<00:00:48.450> it's<00:00:48.570> actually

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
put this back we can see it's actually

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.690 
put this back we can see it's actually
sending<00:00:49.050> these<00:00:49.110> files<00:00:49.379> over<00:00:49.950> Bluetooth<00:00:50.399> so

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
sending these files over Bluetooth so

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.639 
sending these files over Bluetooth so
Android<00:00:51.390> handles<00:00:51.750> all<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.110> handoff<00:00:52.530> between

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
Android handles all the handoff between

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.040 
Android handles all the handoff between
devices<00:00:53.430> so<00:00:53.610> pairing<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.480> disconnecting

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
devices so pairing and disconnecting

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.900 
devices so pairing and disconnecting
connecting<00:00:55.530> all<00:00:56.219> by<00:00:56.399> itself<00:00:56.670> so<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:56.879> don't

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
connecting all by itself so you don't

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.250 
connecting all by itself so you don't
need<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.180> worry<00:00:57.390> about<00:00:57.449> that<00:00:57.780> which<00:00:57.960> is<00:00:58.079> pretty

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
need to worry about that which is pretty

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.430 
need to worry about that which is pretty
cool<00:00:58.530> also<00:00:59.399> means<00:00:59.699> that<00:01:00.050> file<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.260> file

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
cool also means that file a file

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.990 
cool also means that file a file
transfer<00:01:01.530> speeds<00:01:02.010> aren't<00:01:02.250> particularly<00:01:02.640> fast

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
transfer speeds aren't particularly fast

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.369 
transfer speeds aren't particularly fast
but<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:03.570> know<00:01:03.660> reasonably<00:01:04.140> quick

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
but you know reasonably quick

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.890 
but you know reasonably quick
transferring<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.040> photo<00:01:05.220> across<00:01:05.580> there<00:01:05.900> we've

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
transferring a photo across there we've

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.410 
transferring a photo across there we've
got<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.080> there<00:01:07.170> on<00:01:07.380> our<00:01:07.470> second<00:01:07.770> device<00:01:08.420> what

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
got it there on our second device what

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.750 
got it there on our second device what
you<00:01:09.450> can<00:01:09.630> also<00:01:09.750> do<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:10.260> handle<00:01:11.220> multiple<00:01:11.369> files

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
you can also do is handle multiple files

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.539 
you can also do is handle multiple files
in<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.270> same<00:01:12.420> transfer<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:13.979> do<00:01:14.100> that<00:01:14.310> by

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
in the same transfer and you do that by

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.700 
in the same transfer and you do that by
just<00:01:14.820> tagging<00:01:15.360> them<00:01:15.509> in<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.170> post<00:01:16.380> like<00:01:16.590> you

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
just tagging them in the post like you

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.390 
just tagging them in the post like you
normally<00:01:16.890> would

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
normally would

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.920 
normally would
so<00:01:18.360> select<00:01:19.080> a<00:01:19.200> few<00:01:19.350> here<00:01:19.590> then<00:01:20.400> again<00:01:21.390> hold<00:01:21.869> the

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
so select a few here then again hold the

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.960 
so select a few here then again hold the
two<00:01:22.049> devices<00:01:22.290> back-to-back<00:01:23.009> touch<00:01:23.790> the

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
two devices back-to-back touch the

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.660 
two devices back-to-back touch the
screen<00:01:24.890> we'll<00:01:25.890> get<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.189> incoming<00:01:26.460> beam<00:01:26.640> a

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
screen we'll get the incoming beam a

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:27.950 
screen we'll get the incoming beam a
notification<00:01:26.970> it'll<00:01:27.390> take<00:01:27.540> just<00:01:27.570> a<00:01:27.869> bit

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
notification it'll take just a bit

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:28.999 
notification it'll take just a bit
longer<00:01:28.170> this<00:01:28.320> time<00:01:28.380> because<00:01:28.799> you've<00:01:28.890> got<00:01:28.979> more

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
longer this time because you've got more

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.289 
longer this time because you've got more
data<00:01:29.280> transfer<00:01:30.619> also<00:01:31.619> worth<00:01:31.860> noting<00:01:32.009> that

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:32.299 
data transfer also worth noting that

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:34.999 
data transfer also worth noting that
doesn't<00:01:33.299> actually<00:01:33.479> work<00:01:33.869> with<00:01:34.200> Samsung's

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
doesn't actually work with Samsung's

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.340 
doesn't actually work with Samsung's
Espeon<00:01:35.430> technology<00:01:35.970> because<00:01:36.420> that<00:01:36.659> performs

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
Espeon technology because that performs

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.800 
Espeon technology because that performs
a<00:01:37.439> similar<00:01:37.680> function<00:01:37.829> but<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.610> doesn't<00:01:39.090> use

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
a similar function but it doesn't use

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.510 
a similar function but it doesn't use
bluetooth<00:01:40.259> like<00:01:40.470> this<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:40.799> uses<00:01:40.920> Wi-Fi<00:01:41.220> direct

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
bluetooth like this it uses Wi-Fi direct

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.870 
bluetooth like this it uses Wi-Fi direct
to<00:01:41.790> do<00:01:41.909> all<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.060> heavy<00:01:42.150> lifting<00:01:42.950> so<00:01:43.950> just<00:01:44.820> a

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
to do all the heavy lifting so just a

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.550 
to do all the heavy lifting so just a
note<00:01:45.000> that<00:01:45.360> you<00:01:45.600> won't<00:01:45.960> be<00:01:46.020> able<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.229> transfer
