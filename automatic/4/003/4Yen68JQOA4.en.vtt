this side just a little hard you know

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:15.440 
this side just a little hard you know
but<00:05:12.750> it's<00:05:12.960> way<00:05:13.440> way<00:05:13.710> down<00:05:14.010> it's<00:05:14.580> not<00:05:15.000> painful

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:15.450 
but it's way way down it's not painful

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:20.420 
but it's way way down it's not painful
anymore<00:05:15.870> and<00:05:17.510> that<00:05:18.510> that<00:05:19.140> took<00:05:19.440> a<00:05:19.500> while<00:05:19.980> it

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
anymore and that that took a while it

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.930 
anymore and that that took a while it
probably<00:05:20.910> took<00:05:21.480> at<00:05:21.990> least<00:05:22.290> five<00:05:22.740> or<00:05:23.040> six<00:05:23.340> days
