00:00:04.757 --> 00:00:07.942
So today, I'll be making a traditional
chicken Bourguinon recipe...-

00:00:08.142 --> 00:00:12.555
Excuse me, Damien, actually today we'll me making 
a recipe for a younger generation: KFC-style chicken!

00:00:13.056 --> 00:00:16.013
You know, I've never actually been to KFC.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.921
It's really quite simple. 
First, we need to make the breadcrumbs.

00:00:21.105 --> 00:00:27.404
So we need 100g/3,5oz of flour.

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:32.952
Add a large tablespoon of paprika,
be quite generous, we want it to be spicy.

00:00:33.671 --> 00:00:36.845
A tablespoon of oregano,

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.346
or you can use "Herbes de Provence" or 
a mix of herbs instead of oregano.

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.610
Add a tablespoon of dried garlic for extra flavour.

00:00:47.242 --> 00:00:51.892
-A tablespoon of dried onions.
- Can you buy this easily?

00:00:52.113 --> 00:00:54.871
Yes, you can find it easily in most spice aisles.

00:00:55.325 --> 00:00:58.016
Start by mixing the flour.

00:00:58.688 --> 00:01:01.702
And season with pepper.

00:01:02.067 --> 00:01:02.849
Generously.

00:01:03.082 --> 00:01:04.995
Now the salt.

00:01:06.604 --> 00:01:11.230
The seasoning is very important. All the flavour is in the breadcrumbs, coating the chicken.

00:01:11.423 --> 00:01:15.514
So you can really be generous 
with the spices.

00:01:16.831 --> 00:01:20.615
-So this is your favorite recipe?
-Exactly, yes, it's recipe I make for all my friends

00:01:20.888 --> 00:01:24.167
for finger-food or an easy meal.

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:29.691
Now we've finished preparing the flour, 
take a large pasta plate,

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.303
pour 10cl/3,5oz of milk,

00:01:34.724 --> 00:01:37.863
and break in an egg.

00:01:38.056 --> 00:01:41.650
-I'm the assistant today.
-For a change!

00:01:41.875 --> 00:01:44.248
Mix with a fork.

00:01:44.446 --> 00:01:48.255
FYI, Charles is in a cooking school.

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.032
He's studying to become a Chef,
so it's really great fun to work together.

00:01:53.334 --> 00:01:56.847
Ok so Charles' mix is now ready.

00:01:57.363 --> 00:02:02.549
To make the same crispy chicken
 as KFC's, here's my trick:

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:10.002
Coat the chicken pieces twice: 
first in the flour, then in the egg and milk mix, 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:15.778
then back in the flour. It's the double coating that
 makes all the difference. 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.115
Leave all the bone on the drumsticks. 
KFC leaves them too, it adds weight.

00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:25.367
It makes them easier to hold and to coat the flour and you get 
to nibble on the breadcrumbs.

00:02:25.616 --> 00:02:31.461
Make sure to really coat the chicken, this is  
what will add all the flavour.

00:02:31.996 --> 00:02:38.749
Then dip into the egg and milk mix.

00:02:39.116 --> 00:02:45.668
Then back into the flour, you will see the layers buiding up,
 that's the secret.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.750
It has to stick to the chicken.

00:02:49.084 --> 00:02:53.306
Now the chicken is coated,
 it's time to cook it.

00:02:53.854 --> 00:02:57.854
Charles has another tip: 
the oil mustn't be too hot, 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.998
or it will fry without cooking inside. 
So only 160°C/320°F.

00:03:03.218 --> 00:03:09.125
That way it'll be evenly cooked, 
the skin will be golden and extra crispy.

00:03:09.508 --> 00:03:11.308
Action!

00:03:11.684 --> 00:03:14.154
So place in the drumsticks...

00:03:15.676 --> 00:03:18.465
The oil isn't too hot, it's perfect.

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:22.516
See you after 10 to 12
 minutes of cooking!

00:03:22.708 --> 00:03:26.231
Make sure it's not too hot 
so it well cooked inside.

00:03:26.388 --> 00:03:29.533
With a crispy and nice golden color on the outside.

00:03:30.086 --> 00:03:32.017
My mouth is watering already!

00:03:32.211 --> 00:03:36.824
The drumsticks are ready.
You can take them out.

00:03:36.943 --> 00:03:39.786
The color is perfect, 
so is the breadcrumb coating.

00:03:39.982 --> 00:03:43.417
Let all the excess oil drip off. 

00:03:44.417 --> 00:03:49.750
The cooking time is rather long, 
12 minutes to ensure the chicken is well-cooked.

00:03:50.093 --> 00:03:53.135
The same texture and crispiness as KFC's.

00:03:53.505 --> 00:03:56.581
I'm impressed, Charles. 
And I'll taste right now.

00:03:56.883 --> 00:03:59.843
I can eat them now?

00:04:00.014 --> 00:04:03.321
You should wait a few minutes 
so you don't burn yourself!

00:04:03.418 --> 00:04:08.286
I might, but see: 
it looks so crispy!

00:04:09.154 --> 00:04:10.663
It's crunchy, but it really is hot!

00:04:10.863 --> 00:04:11.841
Be careful!

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:16.028
This recipe is a tradition of mine,

00:04:16.163 --> 00:04:18.371
I make it easily once a week.

00:04:18.704 --> 00:04:24.274
It's always delicious. If you try it,
 I'm sure you'll be impressed too.

00:04:24.691 --> 00:04:25.726
It's your turn now!

00:04:25.998 --> 00:04:28.386
KFC-style chicken: 100g/3,5oz of flour, salt and pepper, 1 tbsp of dried garlic, 1 tbsp of dried onion, 

00:04:28.496 --> 00:04:31.059
1 tbsp of paprika powder, 1 tbsp of oregano, 1 egg, 
10cl/3,5oz of milk, 10 chicken drumsticks, frying oil.
