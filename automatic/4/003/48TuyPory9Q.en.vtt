 my bond with bts is going to be quite one 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.500
 back as to all parties in old 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.510
 in the small village outside of Rotterdam and 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.790
 I started between patch cool too 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.960
 pretty fast already booked to speak for 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.520
 those partying 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.980
 so yes it is for me and both 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.900
 memories if yes just guaranteed 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.209
 go party always and especially the 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.620
 Christmas edition that is really the ultimate edition 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.320
 in my 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:52.040
 in my eyes say if you can pectus 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:54.440
 cool think then i think can be all hardcore 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.970
 mainly I have never been up myself 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:00.560
 been back to school that is pretty good 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.010
 scandalous actually but yes that is true 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.690
 I think about it 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.120
 early hardcore real old styles of 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.790
 I used to see it early too 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.550
 so hardstyle program is that kind of 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.680
 things I think of when I 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.480
 really a favorite heart gesture 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.750
 must search then I go for your is 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.519
 of special and the facts is just one 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.370
 also an up-tempo trek 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:22.930
 contains a lot of energy 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.610
 the cake just has a lot of dynamics 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.769
 especially before that time because that track is coming 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.750
 from 1996 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.799
 And that's just really special that you 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.239
 then such 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:32.950
 also make an ingenious pull if you do it 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:35.620
 also compares with other tracks from that 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.330
 time that is quite good 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.150
 progressive my all time favorite 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.250
 rack is just array of 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.379
 easy a post and that is for me 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.879
 the ultimate record that really contains everything 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:47.860
 what a hardcore 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:49.750
 must have courage say breakbeat 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.360
 sits in it at home tuning speed 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:53.859
 sit down and a good hard kick yes that 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.030
 that gives me the feeling for going 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:58.980
 the ultimate 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.980
 art hob he once made as gone 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:10.329
 we have I will run in India yet 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:16.449
 but once the old headbanger's says so 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:18.430
 I start in around 1997 to a maximum of 2003 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:19.930
 and yes then i just go all hits bikini 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.479
 period you made my iraq sally 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.760
 as soon as you but also some favorites 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:27.280
 from other artists from that time that I 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.750
 a lot turned in that period you try 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.669
 really take people back 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.419
 prepare you go back in time 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:34.930
 namely 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:36.400
 his breakfast play turning think that 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.000
 I have played to their pace of 5 to 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.090
 6 turn 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.340
 so that they have perfect opportunity to you 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.840
 quite loose 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.490
 yes probably I'm still the one 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.849
 track for myself in between 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.919
 it is now made but it has 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:54.789
 really that old style so I hope so 

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:57.849
 people that can respect it has 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:05:00.460
 really the early kicks and that sort of thing 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:03.280
 things the that atmosphere the uri melodies 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:05.199
 so hopefully it catches on well with the 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.820
 People in our egos are definitely one 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:07.389
 number of colleagues that I think are very high 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.990
 to sit 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:13.240
 after turning neophyte yes one of the 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.820
 I also think the founders of hardcore 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:18.400
 sound and yes so much you fucking it 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.229

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.660

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:28.750

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.130
