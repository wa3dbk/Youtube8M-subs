00:00:42.069 --> 00:00:42.079 
bit brittle there but at the base they

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:44.410 
bit brittle there but at the base they
also<00:00:42.260> have<00:00:42.620> these<00:00:42.770> big<00:00:43.010> tubers<00:00:43.520> and<00:00:43.760> those

up and made into a meal and fried it's

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.450 
up and made into a meal and fried it's
very<00:00:54.020> fibrous<00:00:54.500> stuff<00:00:54.860> it's<00:00:55.070> probably<00:00:55.160> got<00:00:55.399> a

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
very fibrous stuff it's probably got a

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.950 
very fibrous stuff it's probably got a
couple<00:00:55.579> more<00:00:55.820> uses<00:00:56.210> that<00:00:56.329> I'm<00:00:56.450> thinking<00:00:56.660> of

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
couple more uses that I'm thinking of

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.740 
couple more uses that I'm thinking of
especially<00:00:57.230> dried<00:00:57.649> out<00:00:58.360> might<00:00:59.360> make<00:00:59.540> some

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
especially dried out might make some

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.580 
especially dried out might make some
good<00:00:59.899> tinder<00:01:00.170> or<00:01:00.559> fuel<00:01:01.899> or<00:01:02.899> fibers

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:03.590 
good tinder or fuel or fibers

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:09.100 
good tinder or fuel or fibers
