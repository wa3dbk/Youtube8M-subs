that's<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.399> toss<00:00:41.610> up<00:00:42.020> we<00:00:43.020> can<00:00:43.260> even<00:00:43.590> really

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
that's a toss up we can even really

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.950

measure<00:00:44.129> their<00:00:44.940> complete<00:00:45.360> intelligence

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
measure their complete intelligence

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.350 
measure their complete intelligence
because<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.379> may<00:00:46.559> be<00:00:46.620> above<00:00:47.039> our<00:00:47.219> own<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.820> our

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
because it may be above our own and our

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.750 
because it may be above our own and our
own<00:00:48.539> recording<00:00:49.170> devices<00:00:49.469> but<00:00:50.399> they've<00:00:50.579> gone

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
ahead and declared the dolphin a non

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.110 
ahead and declared the dolphin a non
human<00:00:56.010> person<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.579> therefore<00:00:56.820> it's

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
human person and therefore it's

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.119 
human person and therefore it's
