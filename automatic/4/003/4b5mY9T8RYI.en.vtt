00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.360 
make much profit off them since they're
just<00:00:53.730> like<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.850> private<00:00:54.270> army<00:00:55.160> so<00:00:56.160> what<00:00:56.280> you're

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
to buy something like let's see maybe

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.450 
to buy something like let's see maybe
Gold<00:01:00.690> Coast<00:01:00.930> it's<00:01:01.170> at<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:01.469> really<00:01:02.430> low

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
Gold Coast it's at a really low

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.219 
Gold Coast it's at a really low
percentage<00:01:03.300> right<00:01:03.809> now

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
percentage right now

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.630 
percentage right now
or<00:01:04.710> possibly<00:01:05.720> up<00:01:06.720> an<00:01:06.990> atom<00:01:07.549> something<00:01:08.549> like

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
or possibly up an atom something like

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.609 
or possibly up an atom something like
that<00:01:08.880> but<00:01:09.450> uh<00:01:09.510> you<00:01:09.990> might<00:01:10.049> want<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.409> look<00:01:10.530> at

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
that but uh you might want to look at

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.649 
that but uh you might want to look at
the<00:01:10.740> charts<00:01:11.070> charts<00:01:11.880> first<00:01:12.150> you<00:01:12.420> can<00:01:12.540> buy

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
the charts charts first you can buy

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.260 
the charts charts first you can buy
something<00:01:12.900> like<00:01:12.930> this<00:01:13.220> I<00:01:14.220> will<00:01:15.119> actually

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
something like this I will actually

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.730 
something like this I will actually
probably<00:01:15.659> buy<00:01:15.750> this<00:01:15.810> as<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.259> profit<00:01:16.590> looks

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
probably buy this as the profit looks

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.429 
probably buy this as the profit looks
quite<00:01:16.979> good<00:01:17.009> on<00:01:17.369> this<00:01:17.570> but<00:01:18.570> uh<00:01:18.600> it's<00:01:18.990> not<00:01:19.080> much

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
quite good on this but uh it's not much

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.899 
quite good on this but uh it's not much
so<00:01:19.710> I'm<00:01:19.799> actually<00:01:19.950> not<00:01:20.189> gonna<00:01:20.340> do<00:01:20.549> that

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
so I'm actually not gonna do that

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.789 
so I'm actually not gonna do that
but<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.570> will<00:01:21.630> probably<00:01:21.840> go<00:01:22.110> like<00:01:22.259> this<00:01:22.470> and

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
but it will probably go like this and

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.070 
but it will probably go like this and
rise<00:01:22.950> up<00:01:23.250> so<00:01:23.820> you're<00:01:24.090> gonna<00:01:24.210> be<00:01:24.390> decreasing<00:01:24.900> a

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
rise up so you're gonna be decreasing a

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.080 
rise up so you're gonna be decreasing a
profit<00:01:25.560> until<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.070> rises<00:01:26.220> up<00:01:26.520> like<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.850> next

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
profit until it rises up like the next

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.929 
profit until it rises up like the next
day<00:01:27.270> in-game<00:01:28.170> and<00:01:28.470> then<00:01:29.189> you'll<00:01:29.700> make<00:01:29.909> a

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
day in-game and then you'll make a

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.730 
day in-game and then you'll make a
profit<00:01:30.119> you're<00:01:30.540> gonna<00:01:30.689> that's<00:01:31.530> when<00:01:31.650> you're

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
profit you're gonna that's when you're

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.130 
profit you're gonna that's when you're
gonna<00:01:31.860> want<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.100> sell<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.369> so<00:01:32.400> uh<00:01:32.930> I'm<00:01:33.930> gonna

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
gonna want to sell it so uh I'm gonna

$2 left and then you're gonna want to

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.600 
$2 left and then you're gonna want to
wait<00:02:19.460> maybe<00:02:20.460> a<00:02:20.610> day<00:02:20.940> in<00:02:21.180> game<00:02:21.390> or<00:02:21.600> two<00:02:22.010> or<00:02:23.010> check

wait maybe a day in game or two or check

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.210 
wait maybe a day in game or two or check
back<00:02:23.640> like<00:02:24.060> in<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:24.450> middle<00:02:24.690> of<00:02:24.750> day<00:02:24.990> or<00:02:25.220> quite

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
back like in the middle of day or quite

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.120 
back like in the middle of day or quite
often<00:02:26.400> actually<00:02:26.730> to<00:02:27.240> check<00:02:27.450> on<00:02:27.600> it<00:02:27.780> but<00:02:28.590> uh<00:02:28.620> as

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
often actually to check on it but uh as

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.730 
often actually to check on it but uh as
you<00:02:29.400> can<00:02:29.520> see<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:30.510> profit<00:02:30.930> will<00:02:31.110> start<00:02:31.410> to<00:02:31.590> go

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
you can see the profit will start to go

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.610 
you can see the profit will start to go
down<00:02:32.210> because<00:02:33.210> it's<00:02:33.990> going<00:02:34.170> down<00:02:34.380> and<00:02:34.560> the

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
down because it's going down and the

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.920 
down because it's going down and the
percentage<00:02:35.100> is<00:02:35.310> uh<00:02:35.340> it's<00:02:35.880> not<00:02:36.060> good<00:02:36.270> at<00:02:36.780> the

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
percentage is uh it's not good at the

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.510 
percentage is uh it's not good at the
moment<00:02:37.260> but<00:02:37.680> once<00:02:37.830> it<00:02:37.950> starts<00:02:38.160> going<00:02:38.310> up

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
moment but once it starts going up

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.650 
moment but once it starts going up
you're<00:02:38.730> gonna<00:02:38.850> want<00:02:39.000> to<00:02:39.060> sell<00:02:39.240> it<00:02:39.330> out<00:02:39.420> of<00:02:39.540> high

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
you're gonna want to sell it out of high

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.340 
you're gonna want to sell it out of high
like<00:02:39.990> this<00:02:40.410> one<00:02:40.560> probably<00:02:40.800> is<00:02:41.150> if<00:02:42.150> I<00:02:42.990> were<00:02:43.170> you

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
like this one probably is if I were you

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.920 
like this one probably is if I were you
and<00:02:43.620> you<00:02:44.160> had<00:02:44.310> our<00:02:44.520> insurance<00:02:45.180> it's<00:02:45.570> probably

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
and you had our insurance it's probably

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.540 
and you had our insurance it's probably
at<00:02:46.020> the<00:02:46.140> top<00:02:46.350> right<00:02:46.590> now<00:02:46.740> and<00:02:47.010> I<00:02:47.130> would<00:02:47.280> sell<00:02:47.520> it

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
at the top right now and I would sell it

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.420 
at the top right now and I would sell it
and<00:02:47.820> get<00:02:48.000> a<00:02:48.030> really<00:02:48.570> good<00:02:48.690> profit<00:02:49.220> but<00:02:50.220> right

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
and get a really good profit but right

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.640 
and get a really good profit but right
now<00:02:50.580> as<00:02:51.180> you<00:02:51.390> can<00:02:51.420> see<00:02:51.750> I'm<00:02:52.230> actually<00:02:52.440> getting

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
now as you can see I'm actually getting

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.550 
now as you can see I'm actually getting
a<00:02:52.830> profit<00:02:53.240> because<00:02:54.240> apparently<00:02:54.810> up<00:02:55.110> and<00:02:55.290> Adam

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
a profit because apparently up and Adam

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.500 
a profit because apparently up and Adam
it's<00:02:56.190> going<00:02:56.460> really<00:02:56.760> low<00:02:57.060> right<00:02:57.300> now

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
it's going really low right now

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.240 
it's going really low right now
and<00:02:57.780> it's<00:02:58.020> probably<00:02:58.260> up<00:02:58.530> it's<00:02:58.950> actually

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
and it's probably up it's actually

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.730 
and it's probably up it's actually
probably<00:02:59.430> going<00:02:59.550> up<00:02:59.790> right<00:02:59.970> now<00:03:00.170> but<00:03:01.170> I<00:03:01.410> made<00:03:01.710> a

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740
