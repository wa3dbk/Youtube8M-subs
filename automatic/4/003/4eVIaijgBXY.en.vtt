all<00:00:59.309> the<00:01:00.030> difference<00:01:00.980> now<00:01:01.980> I'm<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.219> bit<00:01:02.340> of<00:01:02.430> a

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
all the difference now I'm a bit of a

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.880 
all the difference now I'm a bit of a
lazy<00:01:02.699> cookin<00:01:03.300> don't<00:01:03.480> tentative<00:01:03.840> way<00:01:04.619> things

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
lazy cookin don't tentative way things

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.929 
lazy cookin don't tentative way things
out<00:01:05.129> so<00:01:05.430> I<00:01:05.700> would<00:01:05.909> say<00:01:07.189> that<00:01:08.189> is<00:01:08.310> about<00:01:08.520> 25

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
out so I would say that is about 25

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.660 
out so I would say that is about 25
grams<00:01:09.210> but<00:01:09.510> don't<00:01:09.990> get<00:01:10.110> too<00:01:10.170> hung<00:01:10.380> up<00:01:10.470> on<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.710> so

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
grams but don't get too hung up on it so

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.840 
grams but don't get too hung up on it so
the<00:01:12.390> flora<00:01:12.630> buttery<00:01:12.840> has<00:01:13.350> melted<00:01:14.220> so<00:01:14.460> next<00:01:14.670> we

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
the flora buttery has melted so next we

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:15.980 
the flora buttery has melted so next we
just<00:01:14.880> get<00:01:15.090> cracking<00:01:15.509> with<00:01:15.540> getting<00:01:15.900> the

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990

before us some more the recipe says 20

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.190 
before us some more the recipe says 20
to<00:02:04.460> 25<00:02:04.910> minutes<00:02:05.060> which<00:02:05.330> is<00:02:05.390> about<00:02:05.630> right<00:02:05.930> and

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
to 25 minutes which is about right and

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.840 
to 25 minutes which is about right and
about<00:02:06.380> what<00:02:06.770> you'll<00:02:07.070> need<00:02:07.250> but<00:02:07.580> I<00:02:07.610> think

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
about what you'll need but I think

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.190 
about what you'll need but I think
everyone's<00:02:08.179> different<00:02:08.600> and<00:02:08.690> everyone<00:02:09.020> likes

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
everyone's different and everyone likes

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.960 
everyone's different and everyone likes
their<00:02:09.410> is<00:02:09.530> also<00:02:09.649> different<00:02:10.160> so<00:02:10.550> I<00:02:10.580> have<00:02:10.729> just

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
their is also different so I have just

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.320 
their is also different so I have just
added<00:02:11.270> my<00:02:11.600> last<00:02:11.870> ladle<00:02:12.380> full<00:02:12.560> of<00:02:12.830> stock<00:02:13.330> so

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
added my last ladle full of stock so

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.180 
added my last ladle full of stock so
this<00:02:14.810> I<00:02:14.990> think<00:02:15.200> is<00:02:15.320> just<00:02:15.500> about<00:02:15.710> done<00:02:15.950> because

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
this I think is just about done because

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.250 
this I think is just about done because
it's<00:02:16.370> nicely<00:02:16.670> soft<00:02:16.940> is<00:02:17.060> kind<00:02:17.300> of<00:02:17.360> sticky<00:02:17.780> but

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
it's nicely soft is kind of sticky but

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.240 
it's nicely soft is kind of sticky but
if<00:02:18.350> you<00:02:18.440> want<00:02:18.620> to<00:02:18.680> get<00:02:18.800> a<00:02:18.830> little<00:02:18.980> bit<00:02:19.160> more

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
if you want to get a little bit more

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.010 
if you want to get a little bit more
ambitious<00:02:19.580> that's<00:02:20.000> completely<00:02:20.480> no<00:02:20.600> problem

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
ambitious that's completely no problem

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.110 
ambitious that's completely no problem
so<00:02:21.230> what<00:02:21.380> you<00:02:21.500> could<00:02:21.709> do<00:02:21.890> is<00:02:22.130> you<00:02:22.790> could<00:02:22.910> try<00:02:23.090> a

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
so what you could do is you could try a

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.000 
so what you could do is you could try a
different<00:02:23.180> cheese<00:02:23.660> so<00:02:24.020> you<00:02:24.500> could<00:02:24.620> have<00:02:24.830> a

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
different cheese so you could have a

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.340 
different cheese so you could have a
lovely<00:02:25.370> Italian<00:02:25.640> gorgonzola<00:02:26.420> cheese<00:02:26.540> and<00:02:27.050> get

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
lovely Italian gorgonzola cheese and get

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.050 
lovely Italian gorgonzola cheese and get
some<00:02:27.530> chunks<00:02:27.860> and<00:02:28.010> run<00:02:28.160> that<00:02:28.310> through<00:02:28.550> what

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
some chunks and run that through what

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.550 
some chunks and run that through what
I'm<00:02:29.180> going<00:02:29.420> to<00:02:29.450> do<00:02:29.570> next<00:02:29.720> is<00:02:29.930> turn<00:02:30.170> it<00:02:30.200> off<00:02:30.410> the

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
I'm going to do next is turn it off the

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.880 
I'm going to do next is turn it off the
heat<00:02:30.709> I<00:02:31.510> love<00:02:32.510> black<00:02:32.810> pepper<00:02:33.020> so<00:02:33.410> I<00:02:33.440> tend<00:02:33.650> to<00:02:33.740> go

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
heat I love black pepper so I tend to go

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.830 
heat I love black pepper so I tend to go
bit<00:02:34.040> over<00:02:34.250> the<00:02:34.340> top<00:02:34.370> with<00:02:34.730> black<00:02:34.910> pepper<00:02:35.150> then

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
bit over the top with black pepper then

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.390 
bit over the top with black pepper then
some<00:02:36.680> grated<00:02:37.489> Parmesan<00:02:37.790> cheese<00:02:38.150> I<00:02:39.400> haven't

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
some grated Parmesan cheese I haven't

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.620 
some grated Parmesan cheese I haven't
given<00:02:40.489> measurements<00:02:41.030> because<00:02:41.180> again<00:02:41.480> I<00:02:41.510> think

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
given measurements because again I think

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.500 
given measurements because again I think
is<00:02:41.930> it's<00:02:42.440> down<00:02:42.709> to<00:02:42.920> personal<00:02:43.640> taste<00:02:43.910> and

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
is it's down to personal taste and

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.660 
is it's down to personal taste and
another<00:02:44.930> little<00:02:45.200> floor<00:02:45.410> amongst<00:02:45.650> tip<00:02:45.950> is<00:02:46.250> if

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
another little floor amongst tip is if

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.370 
another little floor amongst tip is if
you<00:02:46.760> do<00:02:46.910> have<00:02:47.180> kids<00:02:47.480> it<00:02:47.840> is<00:02:47.870> to<00:02:48.019> get<00:02:48.140> them<00:02:48.290> to

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
you do have kids it is to get them to

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.320 
you do have kids it is to get them to
taste<00:02:48.560> it<00:02:48.739> too<00:02:48.890> because<00:02:49.670> of<00:02:49.880> course<00:02:50.030> the<00:02:50.180> more

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
taste it too because of course the more

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:51.940 
taste it too because of course the more
you<00:02:50.630> involve<00:02:50.930> them<00:02:51.200> the<00:02:51.380> more<00:02:51.560> likely<00:02:51.590> they

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
you involve them the more likely they

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.410 
you involve them the more likely they
are<00:02:51.980> to<00:02:52.070> perhaps<00:02:52.580> one<00:02:52.820> eat<00:02:53.000> it

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
are to perhaps one eat it

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.660 
are to perhaps one eat it
my<00:02:54.050> last<00:02:54.290> ingredient<00:02:55.010> which<00:02:55.160> isn't<00:02:55.370> for<00:02:55.610> a

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
my last ingredient which isn't for a

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.729 
my last ingredient which isn't for a
battery<00:02:56.060> and<00:02:56.480> what<00:02:56.840> this<00:02:56.989> will<00:02:57.200> do<00:02:57.320> is<00:02:57.470> give<00:02:57.620> it

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
battery and what this will do is give it

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.870 
battery and what this will do is give it
some<00:02:57.860> really<00:02:58.100> nice<00:02:58.220> flavor<00:03:00.040> and<00:03:01.040> texture<00:03:01.670> as
