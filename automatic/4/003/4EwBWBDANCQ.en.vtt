00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
quite difficult work you know when

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.680 
quite difficult work you know when
you're<00:00:32.340> not<00:00:32.430> a<00:00:32.489> local<00:00:32.730> when<00:00:33.239> you<00:00:33.300> don't<00:00:33.510> even

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
difficult so I found myself having

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.560 
difficult so I found myself having
seeing<00:00:37.380> they<00:00:37.469> travel<00:00:38.070> for<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.640> forward<00:00:39.329> or<00:00:39.390> back

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
seeing they travel for a forward or back

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.590 
seeing they travel for a forward or back
to<00:00:39.840> London<00:00:40.649> all<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.950> time<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:42.149> get<00:00:42.300> my<00:00:42.390> hair

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.889 
to London all the time to get my hair
done<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:43.610> that's<00:00:44.610> that's<00:00:44.969> ok<00:00:45.300> as<00:00:45.450> a<00:00:45.480> student

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
done and that's that's ok as a student

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.869 
done and that's that's ok as a student
when<00:00:46.079> you're<00:00:46.230> kind<00:00:46.469> of<00:00:46.530> getting<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:47.010> bit<00:00:47.789> of

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
when you're kind of getting a bit of

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.740 
when you're kind of getting a bit of
money<00:00:48.090> that's<00:00:48.390> coming<00:00:48.480> in<00:00:48.960> but<00:00:50.629> you<00:00:51.629> know

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
money that's coming in but you know

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.950 
money that's coming in but you know
after<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.379> after<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.770> while<00:00:53.539> it<00:00:54.539> starts<00:00:54.899> to

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
after the after a while it starts to

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.369 
after the after a while it starts to
take<00:00:55.140> its<00:00:55.170> toll<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:56.930> it<00:00:57.930> just<00:00:57.960> becomes

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
take its toll and it just becomes

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.740 
take its toll and it just becomes
increasingly<00:00:59.309> more<00:00:59.910> expensive<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.629> keep

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
increasingly more expensive to keep

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.650 
increasingly more expensive to keep
going<00:01:01.020> back<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.410> forward<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:02.100> so<00:01:03.090> I<00:01:03.449> thought

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
going back and forward and so I thought

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.660 
going back and forward and so I thought
you<00:01:03.719> know<00:01:03.870> what<00:01:04.140> let<00:01:04.379> me<00:01:04.409> just<00:01:04.470> try<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.369> learn

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
you know what let me just try and learn

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.670 
you know what let me just try and learn
to<00:01:05.880> do<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.150> myself<00:01:06.540> like<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.200> worst<00:01:07.409> that<00:01:07.560> can

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
to do it myself like the worst that can

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.770 
to do it myself like the worst that can
happen<00:01:07.740> is<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:08.909> it's<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.150> complete<00:01:09.510> shambles

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
happen is that it's a complete shambles

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.960 
happen is that it's a complete shambles
but<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.350> know<00:01:10.470> if<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:10.680> keep<00:01:10.890> going<00:01:11.070> over<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.760> I

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
but you know if I keep going over it I

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.050 
but you know if I keep going over it I
can<00:01:12.150> do<00:01:12.299> it<00:01:12.330> over<00:01:12.689> and<00:01:12.750> over

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
can do it over and over

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.690 
can do it over and over
again<00:01:13.240> I<00:01:13.450> should<00:01:13.840> get<00:01:13.930> better<00:01:17.189> this<00:01:18.189> YouTube

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
again I should get better this YouTube

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.870 
again I should get better this YouTube
channel<00:01:18.729> is<00:01:19.180> not<00:01:19.509> just<00:01:19.810> about<00:01:19.960> how<00:01:20.680> to<00:01:20.740> do<00:01:21.100> you

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
channel is not just about how to do you

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.760 
channel is not just about how to do you
know<00:01:22.030> grades<00:01:22.539> because<00:01:22.899> I<00:01:23.049> think<00:01:23.350> after<00:01:23.530> a

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
know grades because I think after a

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.029 
know grades because I think after a
while<00:01:23.829> it<00:01:24.460> will<00:01:24.579> just<00:01:24.789> limit<00:01:25.119> it<00:01:25.270> completely

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:26.039 
while it will just limit it completely

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:28.170 
while it will just limit it completely
you<00:01:27.039> only<00:01:27.159> need<00:01:27.280> to<00:01:27.369> be<00:01:27.520> shown<00:01:27.700> a<00:01:27.729> few<00:01:28.000> times

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
you only need to be shown a few times

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.919 
you only need to be shown a few times
how<00:01:28.479> it's<00:01:28.689> done<00:01:29.700> but<00:01:30.700> I<00:01:30.909> think<00:01:31.030> it'll<00:01:31.840> be

00:01:31.919 --> 00:01:31.929 
how it's done but I think it'll be

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:33.810 
how it's done but I think it'll be
important<00:01:32.619> to<00:01:32.740> do<00:01:32.890> different<00:01:33.250> sorts<00:01:33.520> of<00:01:33.580> rays

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
important to do different sorts of rays

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.719 
important to do different sorts of rays
let<00:01:34.119> me<00:01:34.270> could<00:01:34.450> draw<00:01:34.720> and<00:01:35.159> I<00:01:36.159> don't<00:01:36.340> know<00:01:36.399> afro

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
let me could draw and I don't know afro

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:38.639 
let me could draw and I don't know afro
kinky<00:01:36.939> and<00:01:37.630> though<00:01:37.990> it's<00:01:38.140> different<00:01:38.470> source

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:38.649 
kinky and though it's different source

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:40.740 
kinky and though it's different source
of<00:01:38.740> great<00:01:38.890> so<00:01:39.100> I<00:01:39.159> a<00:01:39.399> midget<00:01:39.460> Orioles<00:01:40.390> on<00:01:40.509> for

of great so I a midget Orioles on for

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:41.580 
of great so I a midget Orioles on for
that<00:01:40.869> because<00:01:41.049> it<00:01:41.259> would<00:01:41.409> have<00:01:41.500> been

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
that because it would have been

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.539 
that because it would have been
different<00:01:42.189> in<00:01:42.399> that<00:01:42.460> in<00:01:42.700> ways<00:01:44.190> but<00:01:45.190> it's<00:01:45.340> also

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549 
different in that in ways but it's also

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:48.870 
different in that in ways but it's also
