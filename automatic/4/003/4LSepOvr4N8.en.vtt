line<00:00:15.519> so<00:00:16.299> Henry<00:00:16.539> I<00:00:16.630> know<00:00:16.720> you<00:00:16.840> guys<00:00:17.050> have<00:00:17.230> the

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:17.380 
line so Henry I know you guys have the

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.170 
line so Henry I know you guys have the
two<00:00:17.560> different<00:00:17.740> mass<00:00:18.070> lines<00:00:18.400> the<00:00:18.580> enemy<00:00:18.970> and

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:19.180 
two different mass lines the enemy and

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:20.760 
two different mass lines the enemy and
then<00:00:19.570> the<00:00:19.720> profile<00:00:20.170> do<00:00:20.289> you<00:00:20.350> want<00:00:20.470> to<00:00:20.530> give<00:00:20.650> us

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:20.770 
then the profile do you want to give us

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:22.170 
then the profile do you want to give us
some<00:00:20.949> of<00:00:21.039> the<00:00:21.100> design<00:00:21.430> features<00:00:21.880> that<00:00:21.910> are

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:22.180 
some of the design features that are

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:23.850 
some of the design features that are
gonna<00:00:22.270> be<00:00:22.449> unique<00:00:22.780> to<00:00:22.840> that<00:00:23.110> profile<00:00:23.590> mask

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:23.860 
gonna be unique to that profile mask

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.210 
gonna be unique to that profile mask
line<00:00:24.130> sure<00:00:24.660> so<00:00:25.660> the<00:00:26.080> profile<00:00:26.470> series<00:00:26.770> has<00:00:27.039> been

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.220 
line sure so the profile series has been

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.120 
line sure so the profile series has been
around<00:00:27.460> for<00:00:27.760> a<00:00:27.789> long<00:00:27.970> time<00:00:28.800> starting<00:00:29.800> with<00:00:29.949> the

and we've had a lot of demand for it and
it<00:00:56.109> was<00:00:56.199> important<00:00:56.709> that<00:00:56.739> we<00:00:57.190> could<00:00:57.670> give

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
it was important that we could give

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.389 
it was important that we could give
different<00:00:58.899> types<00:00:58.959> of<00:00:59.229> consumers<00:00:59.769> that<00:00:59.799> same

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:00.399 
different types of consumers that same

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:03.930 
different types of consumers that same
look<00:01:00.729> and<00:01:00.940> styling<00:01:01.600> so<00:01:02.589> what<00:01:03.219> thought<00:01:03.459> profile

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
look and styling so what thought profile

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.690 
look and styling so what thought profile
series<00:01:04.269> we<00:01:04.690> focus<00:01:05.110> on<00:01:05.320> traditional<00:01:05.860> look<00:01:06.460> and

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
series we focus on traditional look and

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.060 
series we focus on traditional look and
traditional<00:01:07.600> construction<00:01:08.290> and<00:01:08.470> what<00:01:08.800> I<00:01:08.830> mean

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
traditional construction and what I mean

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.490 
traditional construction and what I mean
by<00:01:09.220> that<00:01:09.250> is<00:01:09.840> using<00:01:10.840> a<00:01:10.900> fiberglass

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
by that is using a fiberglass

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.880 
by that is using a fiberglass
construction<00:01:11.770> on<00:01:12.520> the<00:01:13.060> 960<00:01:13.810> and<00:01:14.080> the<00:01:14.200> 950

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:14.890 
construction on the 960 and the 950

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.230 
construction on the 960 and the 950
we're<00:01:15.460> using<00:01:15.610> kevlar<00:01:16.240> reinforcements<00:01:18.240> but

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
we're using kevlar reinforcements but

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.020 
we're using kevlar reinforcements but
new<00:01:19.480> for<00:01:19.720> this<00:01:19.810> year<00:01:19.870> are<00:01:20.500> the<00:01:20.830> 950<00:01:21.370> and<00:01:21.490> 940

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
new for this year are the 950 and 940

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.310 
new for this year are the 950 and 940
the<00:01:22.750> 950<00:01:23.350> has<00:01:23.560> a<00:01:23.890> stainless<00:01:24.310> steel<00:01:24.490> wire<00:01:24.910> and

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
the 950 has a stainless steel wire and

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.840 
the 950 has a stainless steel wire and
one<00:01:26.320> of<00:01:26.410> the<00:01:26.470> new<00:01:26.620> features<00:01:26.860> coming<00:01:27.610> into<00:01:27.730> the

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
one of the new features coming into the

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.640 
one of the new features coming into the
profile<00:01:28.240> series<00:01:28.570> is<00:01:28.990> a<00:01:29.020> mechanically

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650 
profile series is a mechanically

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.800 
profile series is a mechanically
attached<00:01:30.040> liner<00:01:30.340> and<00:01:30.640> what<00:01:31.180> that<00:01:31.330> means<00:01:31.480> is

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:31.810 
attached liner and what that means is

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.780 
attached liner and what that means is
that<00:01:32.050> rather<00:01:32.290> than<00:01:32.440> using<00:01:32.800> glue<00:01:33.190> we're

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
that rather than using glue we're

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.610 
that rather than using glue we're
attaching<00:01:34.090> the<00:01:34.420> liner<00:01:34.630> through<00:01:35.050> the<00:01:35.200> hardware

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:35.620 
attaching the liner through the hardware

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.290 
attaching the liner through the hardware
of<00:01:35.740> the<00:01:35.800> mask<00:01:36.420> on<00:01:37.420> the<00:01:37.690> 940<00:01:38.880> same<00:01:39.880> type<00:01:40.150> of
