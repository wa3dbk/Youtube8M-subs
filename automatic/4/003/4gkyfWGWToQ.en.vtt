00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:15.120 

turn<00:04:09.549> that<00:04:09.700> off<00:04:10.170> and<00:04:13.500> you<00:04:14.500> need<00:04:14.680> to<00:04:14.769> be<00:04:14.829> careful

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:18.669 
with this app because you might destroy

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:21.000 
with this app because you might destroy
it<00:04:18.910> you<00:04:19.720> might<00:04:19.900> destroy<00:04:20.320> your<00:04:20.470> iPhone<00:04:20.829> with

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
it you might destroy your iPhone with

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:24.180 
it you might destroy your iPhone with
this<00:04:21.220> so<00:04:21.519> you<00:04:22.300> might<00:04:22.479> as<00:04:22.750> well<00:04:23.080> turn<00:04:23.620> on<00:04:23.860> test

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
this so you might as well turn on test

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:26.670 
this so you might as well turn on test
mode<00:04:24.430> in<00:04:24.610> the<00:04:24.700> beginning<00:04:25.150> so<00:04:25.600> you<00:04:25.660> can<00:04:25.900> test<00:04:26.110> it

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
mode in the beginning so you can test it

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:32.520 
mode in the beginning so you can test it
out<00:04:26.800> and<00:04:27.539> you<00:04:28.539> want<00:04:28.720> to<00:04:28.810> click<00:04:29.530> clean<00:04:31.380> so<00:04:32.380> I

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
out and you want to click clean so I

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.690 
out and you want to click clean so I
want<00:04:32.740> to<00:04:32.860> hit<00:04:33.490> clean<00:04:35.160> he's<00:04:36.160> going<00:04:36.430> to<00:04:36.490> start

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 
want to hit clean he's going to start

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.090 
want to hit clean he's going to start
cleaning

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:05:59.760 

so<00:04:41.850> this<00:04:42.090> might<00:04:42.300> take<00:04:42.570> long<00:04:44.030> so<00:04:45.030> bear<00:04:45.300> with<00:04:45.330> me

00:05:59.760 --> 00:05:59.770 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:02.610 

so<00:06:00.430> I<00:06:00.460> think<00:06:00.610> you<00:06:00.940> will<00:06:01.120> we<00:06:01.810> spring<00:06:02.470> your

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:02.620 
so I think you will we spring your

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:29.860 
so I think you will we spring your
device

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:29.870 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:51.190 

so<00:06:30.740> this<00:06:30.950> process<00:06:31.520> does<00:06:31.910> take<00:06:32.120> quite<00:06:32.600> long
