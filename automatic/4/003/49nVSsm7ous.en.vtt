00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
you want to set up the redstone wiring

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:51.619 
you want to set up the redstone wiring
like<00:00:45.030> so<00:00:48.920> and<00:00:49.920> you<00:00:50.399> want<00:00:50.579> these<00:00:50.850> repeaters<00:00:51.300> on

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
like so and you want these repeaters on

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.970 
like so and you want these repeaters on
full<00:00:51.899> delay<00:00:52.430> and<00:00:53.930> set<00:00:54.930> up<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.170> wirings<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.829> go

all the way across to the other side

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.660 
all the way across to the other side
okay<00:00:59.070> when<00:00:59.550> this<00:00:59.850> is<00:01:00.030> pushed<00:01:00.300> out<00:01:01.250> it<00:01:02.250> will<00:01:02.460> be

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
okay when this is pushed out it will be

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.620 
okay when this is pushed out it will be
a<00:01:02.840> let<00:01:03.840> me<00:01:03.870> just<00:01:04.290> finish<00:01:04.559> digging<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:05.129> hole<00:01:05.309> here

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
a let me just finish digging a hole here

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.020 
a let me just finish digging a hole here
it<00:01:06.630> will<00:01:06.869> be<00:01:07.020> pressed<00:01:07.560> against<00:01:08.070> this<00:01:08.250> block<00:01:08.580> so

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
it will be pressed against this block so

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.700 
it will be pressed against this block so
all<00:01:09.510> you<00:01:09.689> have<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.930> do<00:01:10.049> is<00:01:10.170> put<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.409> repeater

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
all you have to do is put a repeater

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.039 
all you have to do is put a repeater
which<00:01:11.100> will<00:01:11.310> be<00:01:11.460> powering<00:01:11.760> that<00:01:12.060> when<00:01:12.900> it's

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
which will be powering that when it's

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.609 
which will be powering that when it's
extended<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:14.570> then<00:01:15.570> just<00:01:15.900> connect<00:01:16.350> it<00:01:16.500> all

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
extended and then just connect it all

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.960 
extended and then just connect it all
together<00:01:17.210> and<00:01:18.210> now<00:01:19.189> that's<00:01:20.189> setup<00:01:20.640> that's

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
together and now that's setup that's

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.749 
together and now that's setup that's
your<00:01:21.150> basic<00:01:21.479> 2x1<00:01:21.810> piston<00:01:22.439> door<00:01:22.640> should<00:01:23.640> be

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
your basic 2x1 piston door should be

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.539 
your basic 2x1 piston door should be
working<00:01:23.970> right<00:01:24.479> away<00:01:24.570> like<00:01:25.500> so<00:01:25.830> so<00:01:26.340> when<00:01:26.430> you

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
working right away like so so when you

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:27.980 
working right away like so so when you
enter<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.270> there<00:01:27.509> we<00:01:27.630> go

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
enter it there we go

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.630 
enter it there we go
and<00:01:28.159> the<00:01:29.159> next<00:01:29.369> step<00:01:29.700> is<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:30.180> build<00:01:30.420> the

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
and the next step is to build the

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.899 
and the next step is to build the
redstone<00:01:32.640> torch<00:01:33.710> activated<00:01:34.710> switch<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.759> all

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
redstone torch activated switch and all

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.149 
redstone torch activated switch and all
it<00:01:36.030> is<00:01:36.119> is<00:01:36.180> a<00:01:36.360> bud<00:01:36.630> switch<00:01:36.960> which<00:01:37.229> sends<00:01:38.009> out<00:01:38.130> a

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
it is is a bud switch which sends out a

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:42.020 
it is is a bud switch which sends out a
pulse<00:01:38.250> basically<00:01:39.890> let's<00:01:40.890> go<00:01:41.040> ahead<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.280> open

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
pulse basically let's go ahead and open

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.109 
pulse basically let's go ahead and open
this<00:01:42.119> up<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.360> little<00:01:42.770> so<00:01:43.770> pick<00:01:44.700> your<00:01:44.850> pick<00:01:45.090> a

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
this up a little so pick your pick a

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.840 
this up a little so pick your pick a
spot<00:01:45.530> place<00:01:46.530> a<00:01:46.560> redstone<00:01:46.920> torch<00:01:47.130> right<00:01:47.549> under

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
spot place a redstone torch right under

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.670 
spot place a redstone torch right under
it<00:01:47.970> a<00:01:48.149> sticky<00:01:49.140> piston<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:50.869> a<00:01:51.869> dirt<00:01:52.110> block<00:01:52.380> or

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
it a sticky piston and a dirt block or

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.920 
it a sticky piston and a dirt block or
any<00:01:53.070> block<00:01:53.430> that's<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:53.970> solid<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:56.360> you<00:01:57.360> want<00:01:57.600> to

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
any block that's a solid and you want to

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.889 
any block that's a solid and you want to
put<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.469> block<00:01:58.740> one<00:01:59.430> up<00:01:59.670> and<00:01:59.880> behind<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.479> piston

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
put a block one up and behind the piston

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.969 
put a block one up and behind the piston
oh<00:02:01.700> that's<00:02:02.700> gonna<00:02:03.000> get<00:02:03.180> in<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.390> way<00:02:03.979> alright

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
oh that's gonna get in the way alright

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.059 
oh that's gonna get in the way alright
let's<00:02:05.310> build<00:02:05.549> it<00:02:05.670> get<00:02:05.850> away

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.100 

the<00:02:10.069> opposite<00:02:10.429> side<00:02:10.640> all<00:02:11.120> right<00:02:11.209> so<00:02:11.480> two

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
the opposite side all right so two

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:18.520 
the opposite side all right so two
blocks<00:02:12.409> a<00:02:15.370> repeater<00:02:16.370> on<00:02:16.700> two<00:02:17.530> redstone

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
blocks a repeater on two redstone

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.110 
blocks a repeater on two redstone
redstone<00:02:18.980> redstone<00:02:19.780> redstone<00:02:20.780> and<00:02:22.120> repeater

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
redstone redstone redstone and repeater

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.490 
redstone redstone redstone and repeater
on<00:02:23.209> one<00:02:23.540> and<00:02:24.310> that's<00:02:25.310> your<00:02:25.519> working<00:02:26.500> toggle

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
on one and that's your working toggle

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.449 
on one and that's your working toggle
bud<00:02:28.099> switch<00:02:28.400> basically<00:02:29.049> alright<00:02:30.049> so<00:02:30.340> when<00:02:31.340> you

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
bud switch basically alright so when you

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.750 
bud switch basically alright so when you
view<00:02:31.640> this<00:02:31.819> it<00:02:32.510> toggles<00:02:33.140> and<00:02:33.440> it<00:02:34.340> sends<00:02:34.610> out<00:02:34.700> a

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
view this it toggles and it sends out a

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.300 
view this it toggles and it sends out a
quick<00:02:35.209> pulse<00:02:35.769> so<00:02:36.769> we<00:02:36.890> could<00:02:37.010> take<00:02:37.129> advantage

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
quick pulse so we could take advantage

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:43.240 
quick pulse so we could take advantage
of<00:02:37.700> that<00:02:37.849> by<00:02:39.099> knots<00:02:40.099> on<00:02:40.250> the<00:02:40.280> other<00:02:40.430> side<00:02:42.250> ok

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
of that by knots on the other side ok

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:44.770 
of that by knots on the other side ok
looks<00:02:43.640> like<00:02:43.790> we<00:02:43.910> shouldn't<00:02:44.180> have<00:02:44.329> covered<00:02:44.660> it

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
looks like we shouldn't have covered it

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.069 
looks like we shouldn't have covered it
up<00:02:44.900> yet<00:02:46.120> we<00:02:47.120> could<00:02:47.239> take<00:02:47.390> advantage<00:02:47.510> of<00:02:47.930> this

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:48.079 
up yet we could take advantage of this

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:57.839 
up yet we could take advantage of this
by<00:02:49.870> putting<00:02:50.870> a<00:02:50.989> piston<00:02:52.480> facing<00:02:53.480> downwards

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:57.849 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:03.069 

this<00:02:58.849> way<00:02:59.859> ok<00:03:00.859> so<00:03:00.890> how<00:03:01.129> this<00:03:01.280> works<00:03:01.340> is<00:03:02.049> we<00:03:03.049> have

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:03.079 
this way ok so how this works is we have

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:07.960 
this way ok so how this works is we have
a<00:03:03.379> power<00:03:03.739> source<00:03:04.129> and<00:03:05.079> the<00:03:06.079> repeater<00:03:06.470> so<00:03:07.069> when

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
a power source and the repeater so when

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.740 
a power source and the repeater so when
this<00:03:08.239> piston<00:03:09.200> gets<00:03:09.409> toggled<00:03:09.920> it'll<00:03:10.609> send<00:03:11.000> this

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
this piston gets toggled it'll send this

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.870 
this piston gets toggled it'll send this
block<00:03:12.049> downwards<00:03:12.560> and<00:03:12.859> the<00:03:13.489> power<00:03:13.730> will<00:03:13.849> be

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
block downwards and the power will be

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.759 
block downwards and the power will be
able<00:03:14.120> to<00:03:14.299> continue<00:03:14.599> all<00:03:15.019> the<00:03:15.049> way<00:03:15.410> across<00:03:15.650> like

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
able to continue all the way across like

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:22.900 
able to continue all the way across like
so<00:03:17.139> and<00:03:20.169> ok<00:03:21.169> we're<00:03:21.560> almost<00:03:21.650> there<00:03:21.980> all<00:03:22.790> you

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
so and ok we're almost there all you

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.970 
so and ok we're almost there all you
have<00:03:23.030> to<00:03:23.120> do<00:03:23.239> is<00:03:23.359> connect<00:03:23.690> it<00:03:23.810> to<00:03:23.959> your<00:03:24.109> 2x1

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
have to do is connect it to your 2x1

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.930 
have to do is connect it to your 2x1
door<00:03:25.370> like<00:03:26.470> here<00:03:27.470> but<00:03:28.099> when<00:03:28.250> I<00:03:28.280> built<00:03:28.579> just<00:03:28.819> a

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
door like here but when I built just a

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.180 
door like here but when I built just a
minute<00:03:29.180> ago<00:03:29.389> it<00:03:31.030> should<00:03:32.030> work<00:03:32.359> now

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
minute ago it should work now

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.159 
minute ago it should work now
there<00:03:34.190> you<00:03:34.340> go<00:03:34.489> then<00:03:35.389> to<00:03:35.569> close<00:03:35.750> it<00:03:35.930> again

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:36.169 
there you go then to close it again

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:42.610 
there you go then to close it again
there<00:03:37.099> you<00:03:37.250> go<00:03:40.599> now<00:03:41.599> if<00:03:41.780> you<00:03:41.840> just<00:03:42.019> cover<00:03:42.410> this

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
there you go now if you just cover this

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:47.699 
there you go now if you just cover this
back<00:03:42.859> up<00:03:44.379> easy-peasy

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:51.699 

now<00:03:48.940> the<00:03:49.940> only<00:03:50.030> problem<00:03:50.389> is<00:03:50.780> once<00:03:51.470> you're

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
now the only problem is once you're

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.369 
now the only problem is once you're
inside<00:03:51.889> you<00:03:52.730> can't<00:03:52.970> really<00:03:53.209> close<00:03:53.510> it<00:03:53.720> but

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:54.379 
inside you can't really close it but

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:56.289 
inside you can't really close it but
that's<00:03:54.590> easily<00:03:54.889> fixed<00:03:55.099> all<00:03:55.790> you<00:03:55.970> have<00:03:56.090> to<00:03:56.150> do

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 
that's easily fixed all you have to do

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:58.809 
that's easily fixed all you have to do
is<00:03:56.419> send<00:03:56.660> the<00:03:56.720> redstone<00:03:57.169> pulse<00:03:57.500> to<00:03:57.859> this

00:03:58.809 --> 00:03:58.819 
is send the redstone pulse to this

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:02.619 
is send the redstone pulse to this
piston<00:04:00.220> any<00:04:01.220> redstone<00:04:01.760> pulse<00:04:02.060> will<00:04:02.269> do<00:04:02.419> so

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:02.629 
piston any redstone pulse will do so

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:05.470 
piston any redstone pulse will do so
like<00:04:02.810> a<00:04:02.840> simple<00:04:03.349> button<00:04:03.730> which<00:04:04.730> minute<00:04:05.150> which

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
like a simple button which minute which

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.439 
like a simple button which minute which
will<00:04:05.690> be<00:04:05.810> what<00:04:05.959> I'll<00:04:06.079> be<00:04:06.260> doing<00:04:07.180> which<00:04:08.180> is<00:04:08.299> why

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:08.449 
will be what I'll be doing which is why

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:11.170 
will be what I'll be doing which is why
I<00:04:08.480> have<00:04:08.720> these<00:04:08.959> stone<00:04:09.319> buttons<00:04:09.829> so<00:04:10.340> hook<00:04:11.030> up

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
I have these stone buttons so hook up

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.780 
I have these stone buttons so hook up
your<00:04:11.359> button

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.610 

set<00:04:14.790> up<00:04:14.910> your<00:04:14.940> redstone<00:04:15.330> let's<00:04:16.260> put<00:04:16.440> some

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
set up your redstone let's put some

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.360 
set up your redstone let's put some
torches<00:04:17.209> set<00:04:18.209> up<00:04:18.360> your<00:04:18.510> redstone<00:04:19.070> so<00:04:20.070> that<00:04:20.220> it

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
torches set up your redstone so that it

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.630 
torches set up your redstone so that it
reaches<00:04:22.550> the<00:04:23.550> piston<00:04:24.210> that<00:04:24.690> piston

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:25.640 
reaches the piston that piston

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.150 
reaches the piston that piston
the<00:04:26.640> same<00:04:26.850> piston<00:04:27.270> the<00:04:27.390> toggles<00:04:27.840> the<00:04:28.160> switch

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
the same piston the toggles the switch

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:36.210 
the same piston the toggles the switch
basically

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:43.630 

there<00:04:37.220> we<00:04:37.340> go<00:04:38.110> let's<00:04:39.110> cover<00:04:39.530> it<00:04:39.680> up<00:04:42.460> good<00:04:43.460> for

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:43.640 
there we go let's cover it up good for

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:49.120 
there we go let's cover it up good for
everything<00:04:43.910> up<00:04:44.620> and<00:04:47.410> it's<00:04:48.410> probably<00:04:48.650> this<00:04:48.890> one

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
everything up and it's probably this one

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.870 
everything up and it's probably this one
because<00:04:49.490> there's<00:04:49.640> the<00:04:49.850> only<00:04:50.030> grass<00:04:50.240> block<00:04:50.570> and

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
because there's the only grass block and

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.730 
because there's the only grass block and
there's<00:04:52.880> your<00:04:53.090> completed<00:04:53.510> 2x1<00:04:54.020> redstone

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
there's your completed 2x1 redstone

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.260 
there's your completed 2x1 redstone
