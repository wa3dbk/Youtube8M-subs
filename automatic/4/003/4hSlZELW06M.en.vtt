 to enter the track clown 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.370
 Applause and laughter is what I 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.059
 he wants a clown and he wants everything 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.059
 clear artist 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.400
 it's like life in the circus 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:53.640
 as a traveling city until 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.030
 we coexist we get angry many times 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.120
 then there are days that we wake up with 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:03.900
 conditions like the leg and it's not right 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.240
 but this is a total experience you are going 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:09.150
 getting to know people more by the 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.360
 but I was fine with the aftermath apart 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.300
 and the workers the artists in 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.750
 how much do we go out with cesena bar and come back 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:20.940
 to parties when he turns years and we ride 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.690
 the party and inside the blind and all the 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:27.570
 world live or it is a city 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.340
 totally ambulatory in which we live and 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.770
 that you come, we try to live together 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.790
 better than we can by commented need 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.250
 always problems 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.620
 no is not different from the other cities 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.800
 but this is the steering wheel is worth if the 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.800
 density 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:50.270
 and the training is hard or it's already 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.710
 it's a matter of good habit now 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.740
 I'm used, I do not need 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.780
 train but to show me the track 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.210
 before being the trapeze it goes up 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.500
 training for almost four years to 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.480
 do what I do that is to maintain the 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.900
 balance on the feet and with the 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.900
 head 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.820
 in better experience was when we went to 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.820
 madrid to work for a billionaire 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:18.170
 that was in bucket of oil and was 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.600
 immense this castle was a like a 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.550
 castle and I had the pleasure to from 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:28.540
 work for the infanta elena that I took 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:28.540
 photos with her and it was very very nice 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:38.270
 if you had the opportunity to change the 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:41.690
 show business by another profession 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:44.470
 which one would you choose? I'm sorry but not 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.470
 I would change my life 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.390
 I would like to ask you a little something ivÃ¡n and 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:55.630
 that you usually are in the heights 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:58.020
 because you do acrobatics that you feel 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:02.260
 when you are up there in the heights 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:04.930
 and the public is below that you feel or 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:09.820
 how do you feel and I tell you you are not going to 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:11.050
 believe your vertigo is the super truth of 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.970
 vertigo then just think of 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.880
 hold me tight and there is people that 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.460
 is what I feel but good now jokes 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.430
 apart being in the air you feel I do not know 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:24.080
 as a freedom 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:26.630
 you feel the air that hits you 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.410
 it's a very nice experience although I 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.410
 is afraid of the realities 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.940
 5 is still the greatest show 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.680
 of the world for a reason although it has 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.420
 tried the champions league and some 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.150
 great sporting events has tried 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.290
 take away that definition but it's still 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.060
 being the world's greatest show by 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.940
 one reason because it's the new show 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.530
 able to gather a family 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.960
 of full gift to say the favorites 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.820
 dads and children not then moments 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.440
 idyllic there have been so many and so 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.090
 wonderful that I can not tell you one 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.390
 exactly trapeze clowns 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:03.190
 acrobats man guarantors all of them in 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.780
 the same scenario so I do not know 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:09.210
 can lose next year the 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.210
 circus wonderland will be here again
