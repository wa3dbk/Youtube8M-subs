00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
external body looks like this

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.280 
external body looks like this
and<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.579> have<00:01:02.760> not<00:01:02.910> tried<00:01:03.090> this<00:01:03.270> one<00:01:03.809> yet<00:01:03.840> I

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
and I have not tried this one yet I

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:12.310 
and I have not tried this one yet I
recently<00:01:04.769> just<00:01:05.220> got<00:01:05.580> this

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:23.850 

so<00:01:12.860> the<00:01:12.950> water<00:01:13.130> is<00:01:13.400> the<00:01:14.000> same<00:01:14.800> exact

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.740 

to<00:01:24.430> the<00:01:24.550> applicator<00:01:24.970> and<00:01:25.000> this<00:01:25.180> one<00:01:25.360> isn't<00:01:25.510> as

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
to the applicator and this one isn't as

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.120 
to the applicator and this one isn't as
good<00:01:25.960> like<00:01:26.140> there's<00:01:26.710> no<00:01:27.750> like<00:01:28.980> anything<00:01:29.980> right

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
good like there's no like anything right

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.120 
good like there's no like anything right
here<00:01:30.340> and<00:01:30.700> the<00:01:31.030> grip<00:01:31.240> isn't<00:01:31.570> that<00:01:31.690> good<00:01:32.130> on

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
here and the grip isn't that good on

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.100 
here and the grip isn't that good on
this<00:01:33.370> one<00:01:33.550> it<00:01:33.670> has<00:01:33.790> like<00:01:34.030> this<00:01:34.210> little<00:01:34.510> thing

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
this one it has like this little thing

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.030 
this one it has like this little thing
and<00:01:35.440> the<00:01:35.830> grip<00:01:36.010> is<00:01:36.160> like<00:01:36.460> I'm<00:01:36.640> amazing<00:01:36.940> on<00:01:37.300> this

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
and the grip is like I'm amazing on this

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.140 
and the grip is like I'm amazing on this
and<00:01:39.040> this<00:01:39.130> one<00:01:39.340> is<00:01:39.430> also<00:01:39.730> shaped<00:01:40.350> better

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
and this one is also shaped better

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.570 
and this one is also shaped better
straight<00:01:43.150> across<00:01:43.770> so<00:01:44.770> this<00:01:44.920> is<00:01:45.070> the<00:01:45.220> Playtex

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
straight across so this is the Playtex

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:51.530 
straight across so this is the Playtex
and<00:01:46.090> general<00:01:46.390> wide

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.440 

late<00:01:52.080> export

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:05.120 

so<00:01:56.020> the<00:01:56.140> quit<00:01:56.290> export<00:01:56.740> is<00:01:56.890> definitely<00:01:57.729> smaller

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:20.080 

so<00:02:05.670> it's<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:05.939> lot<00:02:06.240> like<00:02:06.920> thinner<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.869> shorter

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:37.430 

plate<00:02:20.690> export<00:02:21.200> and<00:02:21.560> external<00:02:22.010> bite

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:44.880 

it<00:02:38.440> still<00:02:38.740> feels<00:02:38.920> like<00:02:39.190> it<00:02:39.340> can<00:02:39.520> take<00:02:39.730> more

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.130 

that's<00:02:45.400> what<00:02:45.580> it<00:02:45.640> looks<00:02:45.820> like<00:02:46.090> this<00:02:46.840> is<00:02:47.020> the

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
that's what it looks like this is the

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.010 
that's what it looks like this is the
Playtex<00:02:47.440> court

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
Playtex court

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:54.360 
Playtex court
this<00:02:50.020> is<00:02:50.200> the<00:02:50.350> Playtex<00:02:50.680> general<00:02:51.130> ID<00:02:53.280> so<00:02:54.280> the

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
this is the Playtex general ID so the

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.850 
this is the Playtex general ID so the
plate<00:02:54.580> export<00:02:55.030> is<00:02:55.240> still<00:02:55.540> smaller

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.230 

they're<00:03:00.550> both<00:03:00.730> so<00:03:01.150> pretty<00:03:02.140> what<00:03:03.090> they're<00:03:04.090> like

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 
they're both so pretty what they're like

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.140 
they're both so pretty what they're like
ombre

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:17.020 

so<00:03:09.690> they<00:03:09.840> both<00:03:10.140> absorbed<00:03:10.860> like<00:03:11.239> the<00:03:12.239> same

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.090 

neither<00:03:17.720> of<00:03:17.810> whom<00:03:17.960> are<00:03:18.140> leaking<00:03:18.590> if<00:03:18.830> you<00:03:18.950> just

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
neither of whom are leaking if you just

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:37.910 
neither of whom are leaking if you just
hold<00:03:19.400> it<00:03:19.580> but<00:03:19.850> if<00:03:19.940> you<00:03:20.120> squeeze<00:03:20.480> it<00:03:22.240> then

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.520 

so<00:03:38.400> let's<00:03:38.580> look<00:03:38.790> at<00:03:38.970> that

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:50.430 

and<00:03:44.070> this<00:03:44.220> is<00:03:44.370> the<00:03:44.520> Playtex<00:03:44.850> sport

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.440 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:56.770 

the<00:03:50.530> critics<00:03:50.920> generally

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.110 

so<00:03:57.230> they<00:03:57.380> open<00:03:57.680> up<00:03:57.770> exactly<00:03:58.310> the<00:03:58.430> same<00:03:58.670> this

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
so they open up exactly the same this

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.820 
so they open up exactly the same this
one's<00:03:59.360> more<00:03:59.600> like<00:03:59.780> a<00:03:59.810> super<00:04:00.440> of<00:04:00.530> the<00:04:00.650> pod

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
one's more like a super of the pod

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:05.140

export<00:04:03.040> make<00:04:04.040> it's<00:04:04.190> like<00:04:04.370> the<00:04:04.490> same<00:04:04.670> size<00:04:04.880> as

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
export make it's like the same size as

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.930 
export make it's like the same size as
the<00:04:05.270> super<00:04:05.630> heat<00:04:06.050> export<00:04:06.500> so<00:04:07.430> they<00:04:07.550> absorb<00:04:07.850> the

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
the super heat export so they absorb the

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.850

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
same they both squeeze out pretty much

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.180 
same they both squeeze out pretty much
the<00:04:10.070> same<00:04:10.450> so<00:04:11.450> it<00:04:12.080> just<00:04:12.320> depends<00:04:12.650> if<00:04:12.950> you<00:04:13.160> want

it to be smaller or if you don't really
care<00:04:16.340> and<00:04:17.090> also<00:04:18.019> depends<00:04:18.560> on<00:04:18.680> the<00:04:18.739> applicator

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
care and also depends on the applicator
