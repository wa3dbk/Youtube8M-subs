I mounted the caliper up on here not by
the<00:00:33.760> wire<00:00:34.170> through<00:00:35.170> the<00:00:36.070> bracket<00:00:36.780> you<00:00:37.780> don't

you want to support the tire and your
caliper<00:03:28.800> bracket<00:03:29.220> is<00:03:29.370> most<00:03:30.360> likely<00:03:30.570> to<00:03:30.870> fall

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
caliper bracket is most likely to fall

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.840 
caliper bracket is most likely to fall
off<00:03:31.200> too<00:03:31.380> so<00:03:31.800> you're<00:03:32.310> gonna<00:03:32.430> have<00:03:32.550> a<00:03:32.580> couple

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
still in there which I guess is good I

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.920 
still in there which I guess is good I
don't<00:03:55.710> really<00:03:55.950> care
