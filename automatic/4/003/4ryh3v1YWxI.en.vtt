00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:14.299
 we are coming to the matchday press conference 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.880
 to my right the coach of sw 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:18.710
 frankfurt rhine main to my left 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:23.649
 our head coach mike b체skens and that 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:26.320
 word goes how the guest yes we have 

00:00:23.649 --> 00:00:31.029
 I think yesterday at the 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:33.980
 press conference in frankfurt still the 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:38.839
 Question from a journalist I gave 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:42.320
 I believe from Mr. Sch채fer why 

00:00:38.839 --> 00:00:45.410
 we do not play zero to zero at all 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.570
 we would not have 50 times already 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.589
 managed and I still said that 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:54.699
 is not really our goal 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:58.489
 but today we had directly on 00 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:01:00.109
 is always good and you do not 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.600
 got a match and that is 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:04.280
 certainly one way out 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.570
 performance and we have that I think 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.180
 also in both halves through 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:12.350
 Overall good defensive work 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:15.950
 deserved it and the second 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:19.070
 Of course not so good because you do not score 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.440
 has scored and thus is the game 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.140
 just not very good of 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.930
 us because there are already some chances 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.370
 has given us some situation 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.450
 certainly then in the gate would have 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.150
 can be implemented 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:35.270
 and so hate on the one hand 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:37.040
 satisfied with the away point and 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.160
 on the other hand a bit sad that 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.650
 It has not just become more that the 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.400
 situation and that's what I want 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.180
 have said 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:49.369
 thank you very much if you give it 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.170
 ask 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:54.289
 I do not see any signs of it I admit 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.670
 the word mike b체skens 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:02:00.270
 Well and of course we have today 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.159
 made here also against whom we fsv 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:07.740
 knew that it is not equal to the 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:09.989
 simply the fsv is always out 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.030
 a compact defense tries fast 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:15.709
 to switch with their fast people 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.000
 wanted four of them behind kapllani 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.670
 summoned 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.280
 We have it in the first half 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:27.720
 rarely managed in the interiors too 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:32.750
 come because the other times with a lot 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:42.000
 had played to many contacts were 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:44.090
 at first contact up to 210 well too 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.360
 defend 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:51.629
 in this 210 we have to but have to 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.709
 which should be what makes us then 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:56.130
 most likely a bit too 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:03:03.720
 security would have given in the second 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:08.549
 half active if I'm so passive 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:10.530
 acts as in half time one against 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:13.829
 a well-standing opponent then too 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.930
 was still with continuous playing time 

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:17.310
 which has got only one chance 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.489
 because of course, also big rooms 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.769
 had to give 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:25.230
 so must be reported since this with 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:27.829
 be satisfied with this point though 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:32.489
 Here is a threesome here today 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:34.940
 desired many thanks there to ask 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.940
 mike b체skens 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.010
 maybe both coaches are not 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.570
 situation handball in the penalty area yes or 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:46.070
 no, we both saw it like that 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:48.410
 have you rated the scene i have 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:50.570
 I do not have to see her, I realize 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.220
 say it was also from my bank 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.180
 not visible and I do not have any 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.010
 seen tv pictures 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.840
 Referee stood well so 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.640
 We decided we have other games 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.530
 Had other things decided too 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:06.770
 and who will accept it 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:07.460
 We also had to make the decision 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:12.380
 accept 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:16.459
 humble if it has been eleven meters 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:20.600
 It would be a pity not the first time 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:28.610
 that we have 19 junior players 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:30.170
 situations today discuss one 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.030
 general dissatisfaction with the 

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:33.590
 referee services visitor 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:37.190
 Fortuna a bit this season 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:38.990
 out if you just also are today 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:43.060
 is that what women are one or the other 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.060
 situation already gave in the season however 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:51.110
 if you have been there seldom now 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:57.050
 gave without further ado or the 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:05:01.030
 Immigrants situation where we are here too 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.030
 sat and discussed after the game 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.050
 further questions 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:12.490
 That's not the case next 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:15.940
 wait for the fortuna another 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:19.480
 home game against greuther forth on 17 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:20.710
 at 20.15 then is country break and 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:24.850
 then comes the away game in 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:26.410

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:30.300
