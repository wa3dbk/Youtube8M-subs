sound<00:02:06.899> like<00:02:07.079> much<00:02:07.200> but<00:02:07.619> if<00:02:07.740> you<00:02:07.770> think<00:02:07.979> about

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
sound like much but if you think about

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.240 
sound like much but if you think about
it<00:02:08.429> for<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:08.849> 20<00:02:09.330> pound<00:02:09.509> guy<00:02:09.780> that<00:02:10.530> translates

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
it for a 20 pound guy that translates

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.550 
it for a 20 pound guy that translates
into<00:02:11.489> 5<00:02:11.849> pounds<00:02:12.239> so<00:02:12.360> it's<00:02:12.510> quite<00:02:12.780> significant

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
into 5 pounds so it's quite significant

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.280 
into 5 pounds so it's quite significant
and<00:02:14.550> that<00:02:14.970> story<00:02:15.180> says<00:02:15.450> well<00:02:15.720> it's<00:02:15.900> gonna<00:02:16.050> make

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
and that story says well it's gonna make

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.949 
and that story says well it's gonna make
more<00:02:16.530> use<00:02:16.770> of<00:02:16.800> what's<00:02:17.280> in<00:02:17.430> the<00:02:17.580> body<00:02:17.819> so<00:02:18.780> in

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
more use of what's in the body so in

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.540 
more use of what's in the body so in
fury<00:02:19.400> it<00:02:20.400> should<00:02:20.700> work<00:02:20.910> right

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
fury it should work right

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.530 
fury it should work right
well<00:02:23.550> what<00:02:23.760> about<00:02:24.260> effectiveness<00:02:25.260> I<00:02:26.540> finished

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
well what about effectiveness I finished

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.050 
well what about effectiveness I finished
a<00:02:27.690> bottle<00:02:28.080> and<00:02:28.260> for<00:02:29.100> the<00:02:29.160> first<00:02:29.400> two<00:02:29.580> weeks<00:02:29.610> I

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
a bottle and for the first two weeks I

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.990 
a bottle and for the first two weeks I
took<00:02:30.360> three<00:02:30.720> scoops<00:02:31.110> a<00:02:31.290> day<00:02:31.470> and<00:02:31.850> my<00:02:32.850> friend

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
took three scoops a day and my friend

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.940 
took three scoops a day and my friend
told<00:02:33.300> me<00:02:33.420> to<00:02:33.510> take<00:02:33.720> it<00:02:33.900> at<00:02:33.989> least<00:02:34.020> twice<00:02:34.530> a<00:02:34.680> day

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
told me to take it at least twice a day

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.949 
told me to take it at least twice a day
and<00:02:35.130> that's<00:02:35.610> actually<00:02:35.850> the<00:02:36.060> recommendation

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
and that's actually the recommendation

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.540 
and that's actually the recommendation
by<00:02:37.380> is't<00:02:38.160> ori<00:02:38.310> so<00:02:38.730> I've<00:02:39.209> been<00:02:39.480> doing<00:02:39.660> that<00:02:40.550> to

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
by is't ori so I've been doing that to

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.280 
by is't ori so I've been doing that to
two<00:02:41.940> scoops<00:02:42.239> twice<00:02:42.840> a<00:02:42.870> day

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
two scoops twice a day

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.350 
two scoops twice a day
I<00:02:43.850> weighed<00:02:44.850> 186<00:02:45.720> pounds<00:02:45.989> and<00:02:46.830> now<00:02:47.220> some<00:02:48.060> four

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
I weighed 186 pounds and now some four

I weighed 186 pounds and now some four
weeks<00:02:48.570> later<00:02:48.930> I<00:02:49.200> am<00:02:49.890> at<00:02:50.040> 192<00:02:50.700> pounds

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
weeks later I am at 192 pounds

weeks later I am at 192 pounds
I<00:02:52.160> trained<00:02:53.160> three<00:02:53.519> times<00:02:53.790> a<00:02:53.940> week<00:02:53.970> and<00:02:54.450> on

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
I trained three times a week and on

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.800 
I trained three times a week and on
training<00:02:55.440> days<00:02:55.970> you<00:02:56.970> know<00:02:57.060> I<00:02:57.090> take<00:02:57.360> it<00:02:57.540> with<00:02:57.630> my

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
training days you know I take it with my

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.580 
training days you know I take it with my
pulse<00:02:58.110> workout<00:02:58.560> so<00:02:58.860> I<00:02:58.890> can't<00:02:59.630> attribute<00:03:00.630> my

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
pulse workout so I can't attribute my

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:02.540 
pulse workout so I can't attribute my
growth

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.820 
growth
you<00:03:03.180> know<00:03:03.300> subtly<00:03:03.840> to<00:03:04.250> bow<00:03:05.250> grow<00:03:06.560> so<00:03:07.560> what<00:03:07.739> I'm

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
you know subtly to bow grow so what I'm

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.440 
you know subtly to bow grow so what I'm
saying<00:03:08.310> what<00:03:08.550> I'm<00:03:08.640> seeing<00:03:08.880> here<00:03:09.060> is<00:03:09.180> that<00:03:09.420> I

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
saying what I'm seeing here is that I

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.600 
saying what I'm seeing here is that I
that<00:03:09.840> it<00:03:09.959> may<00:03:10.110> take<00:03:10.410> a<00:03:10.440> while<00:03:10.800> to<00:03:11.190> see<00:03:11.400> the

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
that it may take a while to see the

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.360 
that it may take a while to see the
results<00:03:12.060> I<00:03:12.269> would<00:03:13.170> say<00:03:13.380> six<00:03:13.769> to<00:03:13.980> eight<00:03:14.130> weeks

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
results I would say six to eight weeks

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.449 
results I would say six to eight weeks
so<00:03:15.060> I<00:03:15.090> want<00:03:15.660> to<00:03:15.690> know<00:03:15.810> how<00:03:16.739> it's<00:03:16.980> working<00:03:17.250> for

you guys as far as how to take it
it<00:03:21.269> says<00:03:21.660> I'm<00:03:21.989> flavour<00:03:22.650> powder<00:03:23.160> see<00:03:24.090> right

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
it says I'm flavour powder see right

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.410 
it says I'm flavour powder see right
says<00:03:24.480> inflate<00:03:25.049> pop<00:03:25.260> powder<00:03:25.530> so<00:03:26.180> stack<00:03:27.180> it<00:03:27.390> with

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
says inflate pop powder so stack it with

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.300 
says inflate pop powder so stack it with
protein<00:03:27.900> powders<00:03:28.320> for<00:03:28.530> weight<00:03:28.739> gain<00:03:28.769> if

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310
