00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
turning oh oh oh oh oh can we do it

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.280 
turning oh oh oh oh oh can we do it
first<00:02:17.220> try<00:02:17.430> whoo<00:02:18.360> that<00:02:18.630> was<00:02:18.720> actually<00:02:18.959> kind<00:02:19.170> of

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
first try whoo that was actually kind of

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.870 
first try whoo that was actually kind of
close<00:02:19.470> we<00:02:19.709> almost<00:02:19.860> made<00:02:20.190> it<00:02:20.370> we<00:02:20.519> made<00:02:20.550> it<00:02:20.730> like

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
close we almost made it we made it like

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.520 
close we almost made it we made it like
70%<00:02:21.630> of<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:21.870> ways<00:02:22.080> that<00:02:22.200> I<00:02:22.290> was<00:02:22.410> actually

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
70% of the ways that I was actually

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.259 
70% of the ways that I was actually
really<00:02:22.950> really<00:02:23.250> close<00:02:23.430> for<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.700> first<00:02:23.880> try

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
really really close for the first try

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:25.310 
really really close for the first try
let's<00:02:24.420> see<00:02:24.510> if<00:02:24.570> we<00:02:24.630> can<00:02:24.780> do<00:02:24.870> it<00:02:24.900> just<00:02:24.989> as<00:02:25.290> good

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
let's see if we can do it just as good

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.170 
let's see if we can do it just as good
on<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.680> second<00:02:26.160> try<00:02:26.340> so<00:02:26.400> let's<00:02:26.700> see<00:02:26.820> here<00:02:27.000> I

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
on the second try so let's see here I

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.880 
on the second try so let's see here I
slowed<00:02:28.080> down<00:02:28.110> a<00:02:28.350> bit

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
slowed down a bit

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.750 
slowed down a bit
enter<00:02:29.400> hover<00:02:29.580> mode<00:02:29.820> start<00:02:30.630> turning<00:02:31.220> yes<00:02:32.220> yes

enter hover mode start turning yes yes

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.780

yes<00:02:33.360> to<00:02:34.019> make<00:02:34.200> it<00:02:34.380> and<00:02:34.590> we<00:02:35.100> crash<00:02:35.340> on<00:02:35.519> the<00:02:35.580> same

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
yes to make it and we crash on the same

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:36.710 
yes to make it and we crash on the same
spot<00:02:36.090> again

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
spot again

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.150 
spot again
god<00:02:36.870> damn<00:02:37.140> it<00:02:37.260> okay<00:02:37.380> so<00:02:37.500> we<00:02:37.650> need<00:02:37.739> to<00:02:37.860> go<00:02:37.950> a<00:02:37.980> bit

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
god damn it okay so we need to go a bit

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.250 
god damn it okay so we need to go a bit
lower<00:02:38.400> I<00:02:38.580> think<00:02:38.610> that<00:02:39.480> is<00:02:39.570> our<00:02:39.690> problem<00:02:39.959> at<00:02:40.140> the

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
lower I think that is our problem at the

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.930 
lower I think that is our problem at the
moment<00:02:40.590> but<00:02:40.650> we're<00:02:40.890> really<00:02:41.310> really<00:02:41.640> close

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
moment but we're really really close

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.850 
moment but we're really really close
already<00:02:42.360> and<00:02:42.660> we're<00:02:43.080> going<00:02:43.260> to<00:02:43.290> be<00:02:43.380> trying<00:02:43.650> for

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
already and we're going to be trying for

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.350 
already and we're going to be trying for
like<00:02:43.950> two<00:02:44.310> or<00:02:44.459> three<00:02:44.489> times<00:02:44.760> so<00:02:45.060> that<00:02:45.269> is

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
like two or three times so that is

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
like two or three times so that is
actually<00:02:45.600> really<00:02:45.900> good

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
actually really good

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.530 
actually really good
random<00:02:46.769> stunts<00:02:47.010> and<00:02:47.280> random<00:02:47.550> Stan<00:02:47.790> random

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540

freaking stunt right now even though
this<00:02:55.410> is<00:02:55.530> not<00:02:55.680> even<00:02:55.799> a<00:02:55.950> stunt<00:02:56.190> for<00:02:56.280> the<00:02:56.519> episode

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
this is not even a stunt for the episode

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.580

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.420 
see if we can actually make this come on
let's<00:03:01.110> go<00:03:01.230> down<00:03:01.500> it's<00:03:01.769> got<00:03:01.860> bit<00:03:02.010> slower<00:03:02.250> this

let's go down it's got bit slower this

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.000 
let's go down it's got bit slower this
time<00:03:02.489> maybe<00:03:02.959> this<00:03:03.959> is<00:03:04.110> not<00:03:04.260> slow<00:03:04.500> this<00:03:04.739> it's

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
with the original stunt so let's see

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.790 
with the original stunt so let's see
here<00:03:23.130> let's<00:03:24.000> turn<00:03:24.270> on<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.570> hover<00:03:24.930> and<00:03:25.230> start

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
here let's turn on the hover and start

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.110 
here let's turn on the hover and start
turning<00:03:26.010> here<00:03:26.550> we<00:03:26.670> go

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
turning here we go

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.630 
turning here we go
no<00:03:27.420> no<00:03:27.900> this<00:03:28.230> is<00:03:28.350> not<00:03:28.440> gonna<00:03:28.560> work<00:03:28.620> or<00:03:29.370> is<00:03:29.490> it

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
no no this is not gonna work or is it

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.820 
no no this is not gonna work or is it
now<00:03:30.390> let's<00:03:30.990> see<00:03:31.110> if<00:03:31.170> we<00:03:31.200> can<00:03:31.350> get<00:03:31.470> just<00:03:31.710> as

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
now let's see if we can get just as

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.980 
now let's see if we can get just as
lucky<00:03:32.130> with<00:03:32.520> the<00:03:32.700> bridge<00:03:32.940> stunt<00:03:33.360> as<00:03:33.540> well<00:03:33.780> so

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:33.990 
lucky with the bridge stunt as well so

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:35.450 
lucky with the bridge stunt as well so
let's<00:03:34.110> see<00:03:34.260> here<00:03:34.410> I<00:03:34.620> don't<00:03:34.710> think<00:03:34.980> that<00:03:35.370> we

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:35.460 
let's see here I don't think that we

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.190 
let's see here I don't think that we
want<00:03:35.610> to<00:03:35.670> go<00:03:35.790> too<00:03:35.850> fast<00:03:36.270> so<00:03:36.660> let's<00:03:36.900> turn<00:03:37.080> off

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
want to go too fast so let's turn off

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.370 
want to go too fast so let's turn off
the<00:03:37.320> engine<00:03:37.740> and<00:03:38.600> activate<00:03:39.600> the<00:03:39.720> hover<00:03:39.930> here

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
the engine and activate the hover here

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.670 
the engine and activate the hover here
we<00:03:40.590> go<00:03:40.920> start<00:03:41.910> rotating<00:03:42.120> perfect<00:03:43.050> perfect<00:03:43.500> go

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
we go start rotating perfect perfect go

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.330 
we go start rotating perfect perfect go
down<00:03:43.860> a<00:03:43.890> bit<00:03:44.360> and<00:03:45.360> we<00:03:45.780> went<00:03:45.960> too<00:03:46.080> high<00:03:46.340> keep

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
down a bit and we went too high keep

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:58.930 
down a bit and we went too high keep
hovering<00:03:47.520> keep<00:03:47.850> hovering

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.800 

yeah<00:03:59.940> we<00:04:00.360> made<00:04:00.540> it

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
yeah we made it

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.780 
yeah we made it
that<00:04:01.290> was<00:04:01.410> the<00:04:01.560> most<00:04:01.709> unclean<00:04:02.099> stunt<00:04:02.489> I<00:04:02.640> have

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
that was the most unclean stunt I have

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.089 
that was the most unclean stunt I have
ever<00:04:02.940> seen<00:04:03.239> let's<00:04:03.900> try<00:04:04.140> that<00:04:04.319> again<00:04:04.380> it<00:04:04.830> didn't

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 
ever seen let's try that again it didn't

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:06.320 
ever seen let's try that again it didn't
take<00:04:05.190> me<00:04:05.310> too<00:04:05.489> long<00:04:05.670> to<00:04:05.730> like<00:04:05.970> learn<00:04:06.150> how<00:04:06.180> to

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
take me too long to like learn how to

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:07.640 
take me too long to like learn how to
fly<00:04:06.599> this<00:04:06.660> thing<00:04:06.810> because<00:04:07.170> I<00:04:07.200> think<00:04:07.349> that<00:04:07.500> I've

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
fly this thing because I think that I've

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.860 
fly this thing because I think that I've
only<00:04:07.770> been<00:04:07.890> using<00:04:08.069> it<00:04:08.340> for<00:04:08.370> about<00:04:08.640> and<00:04:09.599> I<00:04:09.810> think

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
only been using it for about and I think

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.930 
only been using it for about and I think
20<00:04:10.560> minutes<00:04:10.800> now<00:04:10.950> so<00:04:11.220> yeah<00:04:11.430> but<00:04:11.670> don't<00:04:11.819> feel

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
20 minutes now so yeah but don't feel

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.670 
20 minutes now so yeah but don't feel
like<00:04:12.060> I'm<00:04:12.180> doing<00:04:12.480> that<00:04:12.630> bad<00:04:12.930> with<00:04:13.140> it<00:04:13.260> anyways

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
like I'm doing that bad with it anyways

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.199 
like I'm doing that bad with it anyways
let's<00:04:14.010> see<00:04:14.220> if<00:04:14.340> we<00:04:14.430> can<00:04:14.550> hit<00:04:14.610> the<00:04:14.730> stump<00:04:15.000> this

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
let's see if we can hit the stump this

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.509 
let's see if we can hit the stump this
time<00:04:15.450> so<00:04:15.569> let's<00:04:15.720> try<00:04:15.840> a<00:04:15.870> bit<00:04:16.049> lower<00:04:16.370> and<00:04:17.370> it's

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
time so let's try a bit lower and it's

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:18.849 
time so let's try a bit lower and it's
activated<00:04:18.030> about<00:04:18.209> here

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
activated about here

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:22.340 
activated about here
start<00:04:19.859> turning<00:04:20.040> perfect<00:04:20.820> perfect<00:04:21.389> yes<00:04:21.660> yes

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
start turning perfect perfect yes yes

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.420 
start turning perfect perfect yes yes
we're<00:04:22.590> gonna<00:04:22.710> dragon<00:04:23.070> ate<00:04:23.190> it<00:04:23.310> bro<00:04:25.010> we<00:04:26.010> were<00:04:26.160> so

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
we're gonna dragon ate it bro we were so

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.340 
we're gonna dragon ate it bro we were so
freaking<00:04:26.850> close<00:04:27.000> for<00:04:27.600> some<00:04:27.810> reason<00:04:28.110> I<00:04:28.169> started

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
freaking close for some reason I started

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.320 
freaking close for some reason I started
turning<00:04:28.710> the<00:04:28.800> other<00:04:28.889> way<00:04:29.070> instead<00:04:29.700> of<00:04:29.970> doing<00:04:30.270> a

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
turning the other way instead of doing a

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.180 
turning the other way instead of doing a
360<00:04:30.720> but<00:04:30.990> I<00:04:31.020> was<00:04:31.139> actually<00:04:31.260> really<00:04:31.440> close<00:04:31.950> and

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
360 but I was actually really close and

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.040 
360 but I was actually really close and
I<00:04:32.490> think<00:04:32.850> that<00:04:32.970> we<00:04:33.090> still<00:04:33.270> need<00:04:33.419> to<00:04:33.479> fly<00:04:33.750> way

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
I think that we still need to fly way

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.360 
I think that we still need to fly way
slower<00:04:34.470> because<00:04:34.650> we're<00:04:35.010> going<00:04:35.100> too<00:04:35.340> fast

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
slower because we're going too fast

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.250 
slower because we're going too fast
through<00:04:35.970> the<00:04:36.060> tunnel<00:04:36.360> so<00:04:36.900> we<00:04:36.990> don't<00:04:37.139> actually

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
through the tunnel so we don't actually

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.409 
through the tunnel so we don't actually
have<00:04:37.410> enough<00:04:37.500> time<00:04:37.889> to<00:04:38.040> perform<00:04:38.340> a<00:04:38.430> full<00:04:38.669> 360

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
have enough time to perform a full 360

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:43.219 
have enough time to perform a full 360
so<00:04:40.410> let's<00:04:40.590> slow<00:04:40.770> down<00:04:40.800> a<00:04:41.100> bit<00:04:41.250> over<00:04:41.610> here<00:04:42.060> we<00:04:43.050> go

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:43.229 
so let's slow down a bit over here we go

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:45.560 
so let's slow down a bit over here we go
not<00:04:43.410> going<00:04:43.620> too<00:04:43.800> fast<00:04:44.010> this<00:04:44.280> time<00:04:44.540> so<00:04:45.540> let's

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
not going too fast this time so let's

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.550 
not going too fast this time so let's
start<00:04:45.930> spinning<00:04:46.580> here<00:04:47.580> we<00:04:47.700> go<00:04:48.030> go<00:04:48.419> down<00:04:48.900> damn

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
start spinning here we go go down damn

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.320 
start spinning here we go go down damn
it

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:53.330 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:55.399 

here<00:04:54.330> we<00:04:54.419> go<00:04:54.509> there<00:04:54.720> we<00:04:54.840> go<00:04:54.870> there<00:04:54.990> we<00:04:55.259> go<00:04:55.289> there

00:04:55.399 --> 00:04:55.409 
here we go there we go there we go there

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:59.839 
here we go there we go there we go there
we<00:04:55.710> go<00:04:55.740> there<00:04:55.830> we<00:04:56.159> go<00:04:56.190> and<00:04:56.690> full<00:04:57.690> 360<00:04:58.580> we<00:04:59.580> hit<00:04:59.759> it

00:04:59.839 --> 00:04:59.849 
we go there we go and full 360 we hit it

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:00.290 
we go there we go and full 360 we hit it
guys

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
guys

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.240 
guys
it<00:05:00.449> wasn't<00:05:00.840> the<00:05:00.900> fastest<00:05:01.349> 360<00:05:01.919> in<00:05:01.979> the<00:05:02.039> world

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
it wasn't the fastest 360 in the world

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:03.469 
it wasn't the fastest 360 in the world
but<00:05:02.340> we<00:05:02.460> still<00:05:02.610> made<00:05:02.819> it<00:05:02.849> through<00:05:03.090> with<00:05:03.270> a<00:05:03.300> nice

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479 
but we still made it through with a nice

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:05.089 
but we still made it through with a nice
spin<00:05:03.990> so<00:05:04.169> yeah<00:05:04.289> it<00:05:04.379> was<00:05:04.500> actually<00:05:04.620> a<00:05:04.830> really

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:05.099 
spin so yeah it was actually a really

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:07.010 
spin so yeah it was actually a really
successful<00:05:05.280> stunt<00:05:05.819> so<00:05:06.360> let's<00:05:06.509> see<00:05:06.690> if<00:05:06.780> we<00:05:06.840> can

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
turn around let's try and do it from

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.980 
turn around let's try and do it from
this<00:05:10.919> direction<00:05:11.129> as<00:05:11.669> well<00:05:11.909> let's<00:05:12.270> see<00:05:12.599> here

this direction as well let's see here
let's<00:05:13.500> start<00:05:13.770> spinning<00:05:15.379> can<00:05:16.379> we<00:05:16.440> do<00:05:16.500> it<00:05:16.590> back

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
let's start spinning can we do it back

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.149 
let's start spinning can we do it back
to<00:05:16.770> back<00:05:16.919> can<00:05:17.340> we<00:05:17.430> do<00:05:17.550> it<00:05:17.610> back<00:05:17.789> to<00:05:17.819> back<00:05:18.830> yep<00:05:19.860> we
