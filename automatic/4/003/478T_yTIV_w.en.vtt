00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:13.480
 Keyless open and start the vehicle a nice comfort features 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:17.139
 a lot of Koo is also safe 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:21.509
 or we have to be constantly afraid of car thieves 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.720
 The vehicles can be stolen right before our eyes because of the Kiel 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.099
 SDO transmitter is nearby 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:31.099
 Such horror scenarios are part of everyday life in the future 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.050
 Arnulf Thiemel technical expert of the ADAC can take such fears 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.400
 In principle, at least large team advise legal order 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.470
 It also requires a user that it works with the new Beetle 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:50.440
 familiarized 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.400
 especially if he leaves the vehicle, he should use the 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.550
 Vehicle driver before the operation Stiftel assure that is almost still 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.270
 actually shut off 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.889
 we got the systems in the old BMW 5 30 ticks the 

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:07.569
 soon has a few friends and taken in Jaguar XKR to the chest and on 

00:01:07.569 --> 00:01:10.569
 their safety is checked there are quite differences 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.810
 the smart-key system works with antennas in the trunk in the doors and 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:15.970
 also in the interior 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.970
 Here is a receiver installed in the center console 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.730
 The smart key system of the XK works with four antennas 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.800
 the team BMW 5 30 Ticks the Comfort Access system is called a 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.990
 sophisticated 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.500
 the Munich have receivers in the bumpers in the trunk and in all 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.040
 Door handles installed 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.110
 in the interior there are antennas in the front and back of the 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.110
 center console 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.340
 that together makes ten antennas short for the comfort of access key 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.210
 would 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.660
 Dennis a few fine is there modest 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.820
 Antennas in the driver's and passenger's doors and in the trunk must 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.210
 suffice to identify the driver here 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.210
 There are no other receivers in the interior 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:12.509
 the Tiles co-system the few enemies is content with only three antennas 

00:02:13.249 --> 00:02:15.660
 the working principle is the same everywhere 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.530
 the driver approaches, the antennae picks up the key and open the 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.130
 Doors while leaving the vehicle again a signal to betray he should 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.190
 In particular Germany avoided that the vehicle itself 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.909
 entangled and public legal sat 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:32.230
 Ferritin really does not get it out then 

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:35.789
 can not get out of them on many models 

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:39.779
 not immediately before middle of remote controls specially signal often 

00:02:39.779 --> 00:02:43.729
 simply giving a double key press increases the theft 

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:44.540
 security 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.590
 but are there really serious differences in enjoyment co-system 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:53.700
 Chiles big is not easy Chiles Chloe there are already this 

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:57.739
 Responsibility suddenly moved the team to opposites as we move in 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.849
 if there is a manufacturer where they can get off to 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:05.049
 Tank lid and actually, for example, can still start your vehicle where 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:07.709
 strauss-kahn 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.799
 Of course, this gives us an opportunity to test this 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:14.749
 At a petrol station, we lock the vehicles and test them as they are 

00:03:14.749 --> 00:03:17.609
 Behavior if someone wants to bring in the driver's door 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:20.519
 none of the test candidates can start, so we have the 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.189
 Conditions difficult 

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:25.189
 the fiver recognizes that the key is not approaching with the driver 

00:03:31.499 --> 00:03:33.859
 Dr the doors remain locked 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:37.469
 the BMW only opens the door near the key is the 

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:41.459
 In this case the trunk of the comfort access would recognize the exact one 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.229
 Key position and the driver's door remains tight 

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:46.679
 same situation next candidate 

00:03:46.679 --> 00:03:49.879
 how does the awning Stainless Jaguar behave in everyday situations? 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:52.049
 Gas station 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:55.290
 Here, too, the system recognizes the key position accurately and reacts 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.290
 according to exemplary 

00:03:59.089 --> 00:04:01.920
 he fears that different levels of security 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.730
 Some vehicles actually recognize which type I am in and open 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.679
 then on request only this one door 

00:04:07.679 --> 00:04:11.169
 At all and asks us is very important prudent attention to it 

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:15.119
 put that nobody else is not at the doors and I'm not up to it 

00:04:15.119 --> 00:04:16.689
 makes 

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:20.169
 a test of the Nissan couple club the system with the least number of 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:23.050
 Antennas must prove themselves 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.360
 it is the most accurate the Parthenon also opens the driver's door of the 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:30.960
 Interior is freely accessible and vacated vacant can be started 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.620
 However not 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.570
 the Nissan is the loser in terms of accuracy it opens all doors 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.570
 as far as the key is only close enough to the vehicle 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.840
 the security of the systems is regularly checked also by the ADAC 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.080
 with this simple metal candy box 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.159
 completely stops the radio waves 

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:56.029
 I can only check how the vehicle behaves when no ship 

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:59.029
 is recognized 

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:04.610
 Series of skilled workers 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.669
 Find Nawezi key 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:11.020
 and if he wants to start it now 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.210
 Bushido have 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:17.100
 this then comes to Boston to catch up with Chapeau as a hooded one 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.900
 Lecomte 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.339
 So I can not do that now either 

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:25.159
 All vehicles tested by us report the driver in this way 

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:27.120
 no key is inside 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.330
 States is not possible 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.559
 but what if the transmitter accidentally lands in the trunk 

00:05:33.559 --> 00:05:35.699
 are there from heavy aids 

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:39.160
 the parking tickets unlocked always completely can not be closed 

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:43.759
 Locked out but unfortunately the doors are all running 

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:46.759
 the fiver opened the tailgate the other doors remain 

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:50.619
 if the key is left, the tailgate opens immediately and 

00:05:50.619 --> 00:05:52.629
 reminds the driver to the transmitter 

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:56.099
 Also, that's all the lap driver does not abandon he solves that 

00:05:56.099 --> 00:05:59.099
 Problem even more elegant 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.360
 Our conclusion is that the pet is big in the parking permit which is functional yet 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.080
 with three antennas too inaccurate 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.050
 the comfort access of the BMW works reliably 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:12.360
 the smart key system impresses with its uncomplicated handling 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.539
 all systems were convincing and the winner then greatest precision is the 

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:17.969
 Comfort access of the BMW
