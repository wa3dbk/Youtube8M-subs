00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 I love both I know it's been a long time 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.950
 and this video is just too much 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.269
 It's already January so late 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.190
 already half rum and I do anyway 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.150
 another video from a job books 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.639
 2014 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.020
 and I thought better late than never and 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.270
 That's why I show you mine today 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.869
 year's highlights from 2014 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.859
 what my favorite books and I show 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.109
 you now in any one of you 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.619
 order these neither chronologically 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.929
 still somehow a top ranking or something 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.380
 and yes, as I say, I just start 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.809
 at times 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.960
 Here I once big as the trip 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.329
 starts from bubbles i will get you to 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.980
 you would not get one of all the books 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.969
 The review also made in the 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.739
 infrared link 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.050
 I did one for you so you 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.340
 you can click there and this 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.070
 I have a book at the beginning of the year 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.699
 read and it's science fiction 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:56.039
 moderate but also in the future and me 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.090
 That was really great the second 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.949
 Then I do not catch that good anymore 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.980
 but the first one is really correct 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.300
 i liked it as much as i did 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.129
 Highlight in any case in remembrance 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.600
 next i have like moons like that 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.880
 silver by marissa mayer 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.330
 this is a historical fairy tale 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.700
 adaptation and here it is, so to speak 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.220
 Cinderella and I found it easy 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.979
 I think this idea is incredibly cool 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:22.140
 this whole story into the future too 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.460
 bring and clear you knew again 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.979
 but would run it was still 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.990
 interesting and well written and 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.729
 exciting and I just loved it 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.829
 cool in utah chronicles absolutely wants it 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.430
 Continue reading next on a pile 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.040
 is 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.320
 we want the third part of caracas 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.350
 I have the selection trilogy for this 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.310
 also made a review and i found 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.200
 It was just the grand finale 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.710
 was again better than the two books 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.350
 before 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.540
 and i just loved it it was 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.000
 I just do not know I do it 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.350
 simply mega mega like and that 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.780
 Something a highlight for me is me 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.190
 but really positive in memory 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.710
 I also have life at the beginning of the year 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:02.220
 read the provision of the first part 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.380
 from veronika i think we all know each other 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:08.310
 the series and for disciplines fans it 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:10.410
 is just going on and yes I just love 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.020
 the world i love the characters and 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.280
 I just take everything and straight 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.050
 That's why I grinned a bit 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.370
 The next two parts could be read 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.630
 I just heard that it was 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.450
 getting worse and worse 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.980
 but I will still read it but on 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.650
 In any case, I found the mega mega great 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.769
 and also the film and so on and yes 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:31.170
 every case also a topos 2014 so 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:33.750
 right then i have the leary around here 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.600
 I also have a dystopia, too 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.700
 closed the crevices so 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:41.819
 that's why it 's better that way 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.890
 illness is considered and I liked 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.519
 I have this entire series and 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.470
 threaten 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.840
 in a few days directly behind each other 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.569
 read it away and I like to do it 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.010
 That was in the Easter holidays and you know her 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:55.110
 if you are still so exactly 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.670
 remember as he read in the book and 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.620
 so i have to up all the time 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.420
 but this song belongs to me when I am 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.579
 I have to think this book and so on 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.769
 and vice versa and I do not know me 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:08.579
 The book was just so great and 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:10.230
 I just could not handle the tories 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:14.700
 is being said aloud in the background 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:17.280
 I just like that with inca riding animal and 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:20.370
 somehow immediately fully understand how 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.739
 which have changed so yes and how 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.510
 So you show your view and see 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.609
 It's just super cool but just the one 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.880
 first part was just really cool 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:32.820
 and yes, and by the way, there was that way 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.260
 destroyed that there is someone else still 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.209
 not so long ago that I read 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.579
 in free fall without me in one 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:40.320
 pappfigur fell in love with jessica 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:42.030
 parker i think it really needs to be 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:46.769
 loud but I can not do anything against it now 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:51.170
 is a novel once I hope 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:54.890
 can sit guests was just great 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:56.569
 I'm surprised I am in a good mood 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.459
 made me think 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:01.520
 But I was beautiful too 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:05.650
 been but funny and I want 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:09.050
 just mega happy as one of the cheap 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:12.110
 and have read fantastic books 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:15.130
 agree for the region where for many 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:17.660
 but I really loved this one 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.609
 when disturbed during the video shoot and 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.880
 recognizes in the camera my uncle even 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:23.540
 not that's what if we have this here 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:28.910
 so stops 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:31.760
 the ksc is light brown with a bit blond 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.169
 and threatens better as instagram 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.180
 recognize whatever 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:37.669
 Of course it may not this video 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:40.419
 without giving this book the fate is 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:48.919
 in this traitor by John Green or 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:54.229
 also so great book so nice 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:56.229
 perfect yes everyone has read and 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:58.610
 also really like to understand 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:00.229
 So it was not just one 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.780
 Jahreschighlight it was we go once 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:10.460

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:13.190
 history and wants it all is still 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:16.550

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:19.580

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:23.300
 richie bit art alien apocalypse 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:26.090
 history but insanely written 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:29.419
 and just mega exciting first and 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:31.970
 Although it's just so beautiful, kast says so 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:34.450
 Really so this book really real 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:38.090

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:25.669
 silver sales of books is also more 

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:26.720

 Now with the reading goes on well because 

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:39.490
 which is currently not so splendid 

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:41.380
