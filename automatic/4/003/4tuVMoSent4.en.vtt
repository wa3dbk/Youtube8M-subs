teaching the individual gear ratios

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.319 
teaching the individual gear ratios
involves<00:00:58.320> selecting<00:00:58.949> each<00:00:59.309> gear<00:00:59.699> and<00:00:59.969> running

involves selecting each gear and running

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.330 
involves selecting each gear and running
the<00:01:00.420> engine<00:01:00.649> therefore<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:01.739> must<00:01:01.859> make<00:01:02.070> quite

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
the engine therefore you must make quite

the engine therefore you must make quite
sure<00:01:02.579> that<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.910> bike<00:01:03.090> is<00:01:03.120> secure<00:01:03.629> than<00:01:03.780> a

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
sure that the bike is secure than a

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.170 
sure that the bike is secure than a
suitable<00:01:04.320> paddock<00:01:04.619> stand<00:01:04.920> or<00:01:05.159> on<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.850> centre

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
suitable paddock stand or on the centre

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.060 
suitable paddock stand or on the centre
stand<00:01:06.420> this<00:01:06.900> is<00:01:07.020> obviously<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.500> safety<00:01:07.920> issue

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
stand this is obviously a safety issue

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.039 
stand this is obviously a safety issue
so<00:01:08.220> you<00:01:08.430> must<00:01:08.760> take<00:01:08.970> great<00:01:09.390> care<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:11.810> teach<00:01:12.810> the
