00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.940
 and I'm interested 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.269
 full 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.140
 i 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.770
 there where the people of youtube are 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.080
 as they are, I hope you are well 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:42.520
 well this time is the second 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.960
 video about galaxy devices tricks fame 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:48.240
 good to do this trick obviously 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.600
 we go back to the settings section 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:55.020
 but now let's access the 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:56.670
 developer options now let's 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.590
 give first action until the market let's 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.140
 to have to mark up we will give in 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.110
 to accept 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:06.210
 let's find the job where it says 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.710
 in the entry section now what 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.050
 we will have to do is show 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.850
 you touch this so that it serves us is like 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.980
 can see on the screen is a pointer 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.600
 who puts our android plans and I 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.000
 I stop touching the screen do not appear 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:22.890
 and I'll touch them again as you can see 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.840
 they keep moving now that 's very 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.430
 good because it tells us 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.680
 we know we modified the screen and 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.300
 this pointer then it serves us that there 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.270
 many applications in the app store that 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:37.590
 the pointer does not stop appearing for 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:41.150
 as a root user you need to have 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.360
 a version of android 4.0 for 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.090
 developing 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.180
 Now let's show location of 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.730
 pointer can see up appears us 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.210
 a section like a stick 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:57.450
 now if we keep pressed 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:02:00.390
 it is plotting we move the pointer 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.060
 it stays until we re-dial and 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.510
 it obviously remains where it remained 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:09.869
 last 0 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:11.790
 well this is also recommended 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.220
 that's all I hope you liked 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.130
