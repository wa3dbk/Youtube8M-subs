00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
radiator scenarios for a while now

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.960 
radiator scenarios for a while now
almost<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.220> week<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:22.040> was<00:00:23.040> a<00:00:23.070> few<00:00:23.340> very<00:00:23.700> good

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
suggestions i got from my last video one

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.269 
suggestions i got from my last video one
of<00:00:27.330> them<00:00:27.510> to<00:00:27.720> put<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:27.930> dieta<00:00:28.260> some<00:00:28.500> crowns<00:00:28.830> and

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
of them to put a dieta some crowns and

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.800 
of them to put a dieta some crowns and
one<00:00:29.550> on<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.760> back<00:00:30.329> and<00:00:30.660> push<00:00:31.410> out<00:00:31.680> and<00:00:32.160> out<00:00:32.279> I

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:32.810 
one on the back and push out and out I

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:38.479 
one on the back and push out and out I
probably<00:00:33.890> was<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:34.920> best<00:00:35.780> suggestion<00:00:37.460> why<00:00:38.460> I

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
probably was the best suggestion why I

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.550 
probably was the best suggestion why I
don't<00:00:38.880> want<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.239> do<00:00:39.420> it<00:00:39.540> because<00:00:39.750> I<00:00:40.200> actually

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:40.560 
don't want to do it because I actually

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.400 
don't want to do it because I actually
have<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.460> keep<00:00:41.730> my<00:00:41.880> computer<00:00:42.750> with<00:00:42.960> my<00:00:43.020> desk

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
have to keep my computer with my desk

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.930 
have to keep my computer with my desk
pretty<00:00:44.040> close<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.640> me<00:00:44.790> I<00:00:45.510> really<00:00:45.899> hate<00:00:46.170> wind

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
pretty close to me I really hate wind

pretty close to me I really hate wind
wind<00:00:47.940> blowing<00:00:48.510> out<00:00:48.750> I<00:00:49.649> already<00:00:50.070> had<00:00:50.430> computers

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
wind blowing out I already had computers

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.340 
wind blowing out I already had computers
it<00:00:51.210> blow<00:00:51.809> air<00:00:52.079> on<00:00:52.350> myself<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:54.210> was<00:00:54.350> really

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
it blow air on myself and it was really

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.040 
it blow air on myself and it was really
drive<00:00:55.679> me<00:00:55.829> nuts<00:00:56.070> so<00:00:56.460> I<00:00:56.730> didn't<00:00:57.329> don't<00:00:57.600> want<00:00:57.780> any

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
drive me nuts so I didn't don't want any

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.560 
drive me nuts so I didn't don't want any
air<00:00:58.289> coming<00:00:58.620> this<00:00:58.949> way<00:00:59.160> so<00:00:59.219> this<00:01:00.179> wouldn't

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
air coming this way so this wouldn't

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.560 
air coming this way so this wouldn't
work<00:01:00.750> for<00:01:00.899> this<00:01:01.199> particular<00:01:01.379> reason<00:01:02.570> putting

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
work for this particular reason putting

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.910 
work for this particular reason putting
radiator<00:01:03.870> on<00:01:04.050> the<00:01:04.440> top<00:01:04.880> as<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:05.940> suggested<00:01:06.920> again

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
radiator on the top as I suggested again

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.670 
radiator on the top as I suggested again
having<00:01:08.790> some<00:01:09.000> experiences<00:01:09.690> recently<00:01:10.020> with

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
having some experiences recently with

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.330 
having some experiences recently with
the<00:01:10.710> feeling<00:01:11.750> complicated<00:01:12.750> systems<00:01:13.140> it's<00:01:13.890> not

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
the feeling complicated systems it's not

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.790 
the feeling complicated systems it's not
one<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.940> I<00:01:15.570> don't<00:01:15.780> think<00:01:15.930> it<00:01:16.020> would<00:01:16.170> work<00:01:16.200> item

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:16.800 
one and I don't think it would work item

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.800 
one and I don't think it would work item
two<00:01:17.159> days<00:01:17.310> ago<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.640> was<00:01:17.970> participating<00:01:18.330> pretty

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
two days ago I was participating pretty

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.270 
two days ago I was participating pretty
big<00:01:19.080> built<00:01:19.580> for<00:01:20.580> 369<00:01:21.480> 90<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.500> whatever<00:01:23.010> two

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
big built for 369 90 and whatever two

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.600 
big built for 369 90 and whatever two
radiators<00:01:23.610> in<00:01:23.850> series<00:01:24.420> in<00:01:24.720> TJ<00:01:25.380> 11<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:26.460> was

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
radiators in series in TJ 11 and was

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.640 
radiators in series in TJ 11 and was
arguing<00:01:26.970> with<00:01:27.030> guys<00:01:27.330> as<00:01:27.570> bad<00:01:27.840> decision<00:01:28.500> and

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
arguing with guys as bad decision and

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.420 
arguing with guys as bad decision and
everything<00:01:29.690> but<00:01:30.690> because<00:01:31.680> already<00:01:31.860> installed

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
everything but because already installed

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.820 
everything but because already installed
it<00:01:32.610> we<00:01:32.850> didn't<00:01:33.210> touch<00:01:33.360> it<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:33.780> one<00:01:34.470> radiator

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
it we didn't touch it and one radiator

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.370 
it we didn't touch it and one radiator
blow<00:01:35.220> another<00:01:35.580> and<00:01:38.570> second<00:01:39.570> one<00:01:39.780> parts<00:01:40.200> there

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
blow another and second one parts there

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.400 
blow another and second one parts there
alone<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.450> too<00:01:42.450> much<00:01:42.540> price<00:01:42.870> performance

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:43.410 
alone and too much price performance

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.620 
alone and too much price performance
decision<00:01:44.040> doesn't<00:01:44.220> seems<00:01:44.520> was<00:01:44.940> affected<00:01:45.420> much

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
decision doesn't seems was affected much

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.360 
decision doesn't seems was affected much
and<00:01:46.130> so<00:01:47.130> i<00:01:47.160> decided<00:01:47.760> that<00:01:47.880> i<00:01:48.150> will<00:01:48.300> give<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.780> try

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:49.370 
and so i decided that i will give a try

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.550 
and so i decided that i will give a try
for<00:01:50.370> something<00:01:50.670> that<00:01:51.060> probably<00:01:51.270> most<00:01:52.260> of<00:01:52.470> you

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
for something that probably most of you

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.050 
for something that probably most of you
will<00:01:52.770> start<00:01:53.130> screaming<00:01:53.970> bloody<00:01:54.660> murder<00:01:56.060> very

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
will start screaming bloody murder very

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.010 
will start screaming bloody murder very
quick<00:01:57.450> in<00:01:57.720> the<00:01:57.980> next<00:01:58.980> few<00:01:59.130> seconds<00:01:59.750> but<00:02:00.750> that's

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
quick in the next few seconds but that's

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.020 
quick in the next few seconds but that's
what<00:02:01.200> i'm<00:02:01.380> going<00:02:01.620> to<00:02:01.770> build<00:02:02.160> on<00:02:02.370> the<00:02:02.820> back<00:02:03.000> of

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
what i'm going to build on the back of

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.990 
what i'm going to build on the back of
my<00:02:03.210> case<00:02:03.600> i<00:02:04.730> will<00:02:05.730> sandwich<00:02:06.360> two<00:02:06.930> radiators

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
my case i will sandwich two radiators

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.030 
my case i will sandwich two radiators
between<00:02:09.000> tire<00:02:09.239> works<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:12.769> make<00:02:13.769> it<00:02:13.890> one

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
between tire works and make it one

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.210 
between tire works and make it one
system<00:02:14.459> and<00:02:15.379> i'll<00:02:16.379> see<00:02:16.560> what<00:02:16.739> happened<00:02:17.099> with

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
system and i'll see what happened with

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.089 
system and i'll see what happened with
that<00:02:17.720> ok<00:02:18.720> what<00:02:18.870> i<00:02:18.959> have<00:02:19.140> here<00:02:19.379> i<00:02:19.590> remove

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
that ok what i have here i remove

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.920 
that ok what i have here i remove
standard<00:02:20.790> insert<00:02:21.300> that<00:02:22.140> comes<00:02:22.470> with<00:02:22.770> each<00:02:23.040> fan

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
standard insert that comes with each fan

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:28.899 
standard insert that comes with each fan
and<00:02:24.879> I<00:02:25.879> put<00:02:26.480> those<00:02:27.040> other<00:02:28.040> different<00:02:28.519> inserts

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:28.909 
and I put those other different inserts

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:34.179 
and I put those other different inserts
that<00:02:29.090> you<00:02:29.900> can<00:02:30.140> buy<00:02:30.319> as<00:02:31.390> accessory<00:02:33.010> but<00:02:34.010> it

00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:34.189 
that you can buy as accessory but it

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:36.550 
that you can buy as accessory but it
allows<00:02:34.519> you<00:02:34.849> to<00:02:35.480> put<00:02:35.689> separate<00:02:36.140> screws<00:02:36.439> on

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
allows you to put separate screws on

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.199 
allows you to put separate screws on
both<00:02:36.739> counts<00:02:36.950> as<00:02:37.280> always<00:02:37.519> you<00:02:37.640> have<00:02:37.819> one<00:02:38.000> piece

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
both counts as always you have one piece

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.399 
both counts as always you have one piece
of<00:02:38.390> rubber<00:02:38.930> going<00:02:39.579> from<00:02:40.579> each<00:02:40.760> Pole<00:02:41.230> so<00:02:42.230> what

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:42.409 
of rubber going from each Pole so what

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:45.640 
of rubber going from each Pole so what
we<00:02:42.530> have<00:02:42.680> here<00:02:43.329> have<00:02:44.329> this<00:02:44.480> assembly<00:02:44.959> I<00:02:45.109> need

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
we have here have this assembly I need

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.470 
we have here have this assembly I need
to<00:02:45.889> screw<00:02:46.719> fans<00:02:47.799> to<00:02:48.799> one<00:02:49.159> radiator<00:02:49.609> and<00:02:49.879> then<00:02:50.450> I

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
to screw fans to one radiator and then I

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.289 
to screw fans to one radiator and then I
flip<00:02:50.989> it<00:02:51.109> over<00:02:51.319> and<00:02:51.560> put<00:02:52.549> the<00:02:52.700> secondary<00:02:53.150> data

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299 
flip it over and put the secondary data

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:55.780 
flip it over and put the secondary data
on<00:02:53.659> what<00:02:54.170> I<00:02:54.230> like<00:02:54.500> about<00:02:54.530> those<00:02:55.010> newer<00:02:55.310> editors

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
on what I like about those newer editors

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.849 
on what I like about those newer editors
first<00:02:56.090> of<00:02:56.269> all<00:02:56.419> the<00:02:57.260> clearance<00:02:57.680> between

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:57.859 
first of all the clearance between

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:02.979 
first of all the clearance between
fiends<00:02:58.609> and<00:02:59.980> mounting<00:03:01.150> brackets<00:03:02.150> is<00:03:02.359> pretty

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
fiends and mounting brackets is pretty

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.559 
fiends and mounting brackets is pretty
deep<00:03:03.400> bigger<00:03:04.400> than<00:03:04.700> many<00:03:05.299> other

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
deep bigger than many other

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.259 
deep bigger than many other
manufacturers<00:03:06.230> so<00:03:06.530> you<00:03:07.430> have<00:03:07.669> a<00:03:07.700> little<00:03:07.970> bit

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
manufacturers so you have a little bit

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:11.319 
manufacturers so you have a little bit
more<00:03:08.919> space<00:03:09.919> to<00:03:10.280> work<00:03:10.549> with<00:03:10.609> your<00:03:10.939> screws

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:11.329 
more space to work with your screws

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:15.640 
more space to work with your screws
without<00:03:11.959> punching<00:03:12.370> tubes<00:03:13.370> but<00:03:14.060> on<00:03:15.049> top<00:03:15.590> of

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
without punching tubes but on top of

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.750 
without punching tubes but on top of
that<00:03:16.450> actually<00:03:17.450> screws<00:03:17.840> going<00:03:18.530> to<00:03:18.980> punch<00:03:19.280> pins

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
that actually screws going to punch pins

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.929 
that actually screws going to punch pins
not<00:03:20.269> tube<00:03:20.719> which<00:03:21.620> not<00:03:21.889> the<00:03:22.040> case<00:03:22.310> for<00:03:22.849> example

00:03:22.929 --> 00:03:22.939 
not tube which not the case for example

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:25.869 
not tube which not the case for example
on<00:03:23.419> ikki<00:03:24.019> radiators<00:03:24.650> which<00:03:25.280> screw<00:03:25.669> goes

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:25.879 
on ikki radiators which screw goes

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:28.719 
on ikki radiators which screw goes
straight<00:03:26.540> to<00:03:26.810> the<00:03:26.840> tube<00:03:27.200> and<00:03:27.549> some<00:03:28.549> other

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:28.729 
straight to the tube and some other

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:32.559 
straight to the tube and some other
models<00:03:29.120> so<00:03:29.629> this<00:03:29.870> one<00:03:30.079> is<00:03:30.319> a<00:03:30.849> foolproof<00:03:31.849> so<00:03:32.510> to

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:32.569 
models so this one is a foolproof so to

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:34.349 
models so this one is a foolproof so to
speak<00:03:32.930> so<00:03:33.349> you<00:03:33.500> have<00:03:33.680> a<00:03:33.709> little<00:03:33.949> bit<00:03:34.069> more

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:34.359 
speak so you have a little bit more

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:37.869 
speak so you have a little bit more
space<00:03:35.359> to<00:03:35.659> go<00:03:35.930> with<00:03:36.199> a<00:03:36.229> screw<00:03:36.620> and<00:03:36.829> even<00:03:37.579> if<00:03:37.699> you

00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:37.879 
space to go with a screw and even if you

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:41.080 
space to go with a screw and even if you
still<00:03:38.569> going<00:03:39.260> to<00:03:39.439> damage<00:03:39.650> radiator<00:03:40.280> at<00:03:40.760> least

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
still going to damage radiator at least

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.360 
still going to damage radiator at least
you<00:03:41.269> you<00:03:41.840> wouldn't<00:03:42.199> punch<00:03:42.620> it<00:03:42.859> and<00:03:43.159> this

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
you you wouldn't punch it and this

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.909 
you you wouldn't punch it and this
wouldn't<00:03:43.760> leak<00:03:44.109> so<00:03:45.109> that's<00:03:45.530> a<00:03:45.620> good

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:45.919 
wouldn't leak so that's a good

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:48.839 
wouldn't leak so that's a good
observation<00:03:46.250> about<00:03:46.849> those<00:03:47.299> new<00:03:47.750> acts

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:48.849 
observation about those new acts

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:52.479 
observation about those new acts
radiators<00:03:49.849> keeps<00:03:50.569> us<00:03:50.689> in<00:03:50.840> mind<00:03:51.250> okay<00:03:52.250> like<00:03:52.459> a

radiators keeps us in mind okay like a
chapter<00:03:53.090> if<00:03:53.329> those<00:03:54.009> fans<00:03:55.009> actually<00:03:55.250> push<00:03:55.699> any

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
chapter if those fans actually push any

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.300 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:20.810 

it<00:04:13.840> sound<00:04:14.320> as<00:04:14.470> though<00:04:14.500> still

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.060 

just<00:04:21.420> checking<00:04:21.750> i<00:04:21.930> have<00:04:22.140> any<00:04:22.320> loss<00:04:22.650> here<00:04:23.010> i

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
just checking i have any loss here i

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:33.470 
just checking i have any loss here i
have<00:04:23.370> a<00:04:25.070> those<00:04:29.570> silencers<00:04:30.570> so<00:04:31.470> they<00:04:32.240> you<00:04:33.240> did

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:33.480 
have a those silencers so they you did

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:43.710 
have a those silencers so they you did
it<00:04:33.630> better<00:04:34.730> insulation<00:04:35.730> and<00:04:36.270> also<00:04:36.840> oh<00:04:37.080> yeah

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:51.540 

pretty<00:04:44.410> good<00:04:48.090> and<00:04:49.170> when<00:04:50.170> it's<00:04:50.200> not<00:04:50.800> on<00:04:50.860> a<00:04:51.040> table

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
pretty good and when it's not on a table

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:58.980 
pretty good and when it's not on a table
is<00:04:51.670> pretty<00:04:51.940> quiet<00:04:52.240> too<00:04:52.600> I<00:04:57.750> don't<00:04:58.750> know<00:04:58.840> if<00:04:58.930> you

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
is pretty quiet too I don't know if you

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.140 
is pretty quiet too I don't know if you
can<00:04:59.170> hear<00:04:59.350> the<00:04:59.530> difference<00:04:59.560> but<00:05:00.070> as<00:05:00.580> soon<00:05:00.910> as<00:05:01.120> I

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
can hear the difference but as soon as I

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:10.070 
can hear the difference but as soon as I
lifted<00:05:02.640> much<00:05:03.640> brighter<00:05:06.450> okay<00:05:07.450> sounds<00:05:08.140> good

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
lifted much brighter okay sounds good

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.260 
lifted much brighter okay sounds good
