00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
multiple target countries and when you

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.570 
multiple target countries and when you
only<00:00:12.480> have<00:00:12.690> one<00:00:12.719> site<00:00:13.080> to<00:00:13.110> work<00:00:13.440> with<00:00:13.710> that's

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
only have one site to work with that's

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.400 
only have one site to work with that's
easy<00:00:14.820> enough<00:00:14.940> to<00:00:15.330> get<00:00:15.480> traffic<00:00:15.960> from

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
easy enough to get traffic from

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.859 
easy enough to get traffic from
different<00:00:16.890> countries<00:00:17.250> but<00:00:17.430> to<00:00:17.609> get<00:00:17.869> targeted

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
different countries but to get targeted

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.260 
different countries but to get targeted
traffic<00:00:19.460> from<00:00:20.460> different<00:00:20.550> countries<00:00:21.119> is<00:00:21.240> not

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
traffic from different countries is not

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.420 
traffic from different countries is not
so<00:00:21.539> easy<00:00:21.720> in<00:00:21.930> other<00:00:22.050> words<00:00:22.230> they<00:00:22.500> get<00:00:22.680> a<00:00:22.949> good

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
so easy in other words they get a good

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.330 
so easy in other words they get a good
ranking<00:00:23.850> for<00:00:24.689> only<00:00:24.990> our<00:00:25.080> top<00:00:25.230> keywords<00:00:25.710> in<00:00:26.010> the

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
like we just put a study and put it in

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.600 
like we just put a study and put it in
the<00:01:59.189> sitemap<00:02:00.710> this<00:02:01.710> is<00:02:01.860> -<00:02:01.979> we<00:02:02.100> just<00:02:02.280> have<00:02:02.399> one

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
the sitemap this is - we just have one

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.959 
the sitemap this is - we just have one
page<00:02:02.850> SEO<00:02:03.600> -<00:02:04.049> software<00:02:04.590> that's<00:02:04.770> Ireland<00:02:05.189> PHP

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
page SEO - software that's Ireland PHP

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.359

that's<00:02:06.570> all<00:02:06.780> there<00:02:07.020> is<00:02:07.049> in<00:02:07.469> this<00:02:07.710> sitemap

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
that's all there is in this sitemap

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.760 
that's all there is in this sitemap
so<00:02:08.580> it'd<00:02:09.239> be<00:02:09.300> interesting<00:02:09.420> to<00:02:09.869> see<00:02:10.080> what

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
so it'd be interesting to see what

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.100 
so it'd be interesting to see what
Google<00:02:11.129> makes<00:02:11.280> so<00:02:11.430> that<00:02:11.580> when<00:02:11.760> it<00:02:11.879> picks<00:02:12.060> it<00:02:12.180> up

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
Google makes so that when it picks it up
