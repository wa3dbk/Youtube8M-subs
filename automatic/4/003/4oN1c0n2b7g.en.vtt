00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.960
 get for many reasons 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.960
 It is obvious to speak first of your graphic engine 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.140
 since it was shown years ago there are many titles that have 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.040
 used that technology created by nick and kevin 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.970
 but it was clear that they would be the ones who surprised us again 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.850
 squeezing to the maximum its own destiny 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.530

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:40.990
 weapons vehicles 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.409
 and above all a very extensive mapping offer a new detail in this type of 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.909
 games oviedo all the elements with great ease and without impact on note of

 the visual power are rialto romÃ©n 3 is indisputable 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.020
 much better than the one offered in gypsum escaped 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.020
 even as a mid-high-end PC 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.160
 the basis of this new tournament the multitudinous clashes 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.019
 and this is where we find marx game anyway

 lasts one against one and the gnome two war where we must link modes 

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:20.329
 to destroy the enemy nucleus 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:23.609
 depending on what kind of games we take we can choose more or less 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:27.689
 battlefields more prepared and wide to be traveled by 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:32.290
 vehicles and another more recognized were strategic although together they have 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.559
 seemed like too little 

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:38.279
 we can choose any of the different races and during the combat we have 

00:02:38.279 --> 00:02:42.219
 our disposition all kinds of weapons and items that we will find scattered 

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:43.479
 on the stage 

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:47.259

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:56.619
 the modding like maybe stays halfway and does not make much sense 

00:02:56.619 --> 00:03:00.169
 it justifies with salvem in mass confrontations like 

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:03.709
 online competitions without contributing anything other than the one offered in its slope 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:05.109
 multiplayer 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:09.109
 We were expecting a different story if it could continue what it presages in 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:11.659
 the incredible previous cinematics 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:15.700
 but we are going to the roots the series tore press mention has characterized by 

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:19.449
 Rapid massive clashes violent and constant with delay 

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:22.449
 constantly and resuscitate at another point will be the usual 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:27.609
 and this is what it is and we like a lot of fast games pink other habits and 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:29.049
 action at hand 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:32.709
 so we surrender to such a visual and technical feat of this new 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:34.469
 multiplayer experience 

00:03:34.469 --> 00:03:39.040
 that yes it can be played with you online writings against another 31 3 years 

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:41.889
