00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:09.000
 yes and welcome to this 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:12.059
 new top five weapons video this time 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.089
 is about top 5 of the best pvp was from 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.199
 ahead normal as I said everything completely 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.190
 you do not have to think so 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.230
 one hundred percent with this opinion 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.500
 agree is essential 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.510
 the opinion that I also have dvp and 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.130
 As the situation at the moment please note 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.570
 even that there can be patches 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.670
 Weapons can be improved and 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.289
 deteriorated please be aware 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.730
 So before you criticize that 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.530
 catch the release date of this video 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.460
 Let's start with a legendary one 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.200
 machine gun in fifth place we have 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.000
 the hammer johannes cock once you can 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.110
 by the railroader get that 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.910
 is characterized by a relative 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.090
 low fire wheel a high rhythm 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.190
 but extremely hurt this was for 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.750
 that distance from middle to middle distance 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.890
 and sometimes even if you have one 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.379
 has luck with the scatter 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.480
 so that the rebound is on it too 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.530
 Another dance very well usable there 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.670
 it's just this huge damage that really does hurt 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.619
 enemy guardian extremely fast 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.390
 So defeat is a deserved one 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.400
 to five in my opinion by that 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:14.189
 that it is not exotic then that 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:16.170
 best md in pvp on place four we have 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.270
 also a railroader was for us 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.400
 was the rim that I like that lie 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.979
 a shotgun shooting very slowly 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.830
 a relatively long after but headed 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.159
 for that very very much for each shot 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.000
 hurt if you are lucky with the 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.100
 You can also do that with crafts 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.780
 that you shoot someone kills and 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.210
 immediately the magazine back to one 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.070
 is padded sit cartridge that is 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.380
 this shotgun is really with the 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.600
 right skills is this weapon 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.329
 an absolute beast in close combat 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.520
 absolute must also keep up with matador 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:51.740
 and party crasher press1 but I think 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.740
 that we actually still best 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.750
 in third place a sniper the 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.090
 maybe some of you do not know 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.830
 maybe the game will only be in 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.510
 never started this year 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.850
 have played the glass camera 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.250
 sniper precise revenge wide street 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.750
 stands out for me personally mainz 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.610
 playing style and there I have quite 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.620
 or I find her incredibly good because 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.690
 She can have six shots in the magazine 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.010
 an incredibly low recoil has 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.900
 and for a sniper a very high one 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.490
 fire rate that is when you are in 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.300
 You can always fight this middle distance 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.740
 two more times very fast 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.330
 shoot one after the other on the body 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.160
 you will really between shots 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.230
 is not even a second break 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.040
 and the enemy is in the nilkommanichts 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.660
 last 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.370
 So you will not be able to really do that 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.989
 of course , should be very active 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.400
 it works in any case like one 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.070
 normal is a couple of two bodies 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.870
 Shot a headshot and this sniper 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.370
 is really really very aggressive 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:46.280
 player and in my opinion on 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:49.400
 best in the pvp we come to the second place 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.440
 in second place is the thorn 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.640
 is one of many hated weapon i 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.080
 maybe I apologize for that too 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.459
 that many people through this video 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.440
 possibly use it there again 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.209
 I apologize for that but 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.430
 Thorn is a very good weapon that is 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:04.030
 You can definitely say thorn 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.080
 a revolver is an exotic one 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.120
 creating creates over time 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.549
 like to call bums hurting when you call 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.110
 now two headshots are making at the time 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:14.330
 the opponent by the bums after death 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.370
 That sounds pretty okay, of course 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.200
 It actually has this weapon, too 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.090
 a relatively high recoil works 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.440
 nevertheless very controllable one must 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.730
 stop between each shot once briefly 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.680
 wait and the weapon is then stop 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.299
 just as it was previously aligned 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.970
 that means you are waiting for a minute and 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:30.560
 shoot again that's really 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.570
 pretty good this weapon causes nevertheless 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.610
 a lot of damage has a normal after 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.049
 load so the sets are excellent 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.329
 the whole damage comes then too 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.860
 and the opponent looks like this 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:41.480
 as he would have burning fat with was 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.590
 a little panic at the opponent 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.590
 if you meet him then 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.980
 and at number one who has it with me 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:51.629
 Of course, the last word is different 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.400
 the last word from a revolver the 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:55.319
 can be fired fully automatically 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.030
 harm an incredible headshot 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:58.560
 caused by and from the hip yet 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.659
 times more headshot for the beginning I say 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.430
 have already 115 heads shot kriz 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:04.349
 What made this weapon really 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.409
 really really good if that 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:08.610
 Fire rate diddy has what you still have 

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:10.859
 a bit startling that we have this one 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.480
 dice she has a shorter childhood than 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:13.709
 Most ngs that is when you use it 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.840
 from the hip twice on the head 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:17.729
 the opponent is quicker death than meets 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.100
 if mg would shoot at them 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:22.109
 which is very op is the lab wants that 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.300
 last word is also patched soon 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:26.729
 but at the moment it is really the best 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.680
 weapon pvp in my opinion super 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:29.699
 not great damage super fire rate 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.530
 for recoil you have to do it though 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:33.539
 but that's not possible 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.190
 very difficult very beginners 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:37.260
 friendly for you even say that 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:40.440
 conclusion but all in all one 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:42.479
 wonderful weapon but that's ok 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.000
 what this ranking of this top 5 of the 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:46.620
 best tv was for yes i am pleased 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.210

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.949
 just another abo if you new from 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:51.660
 my channel side and i would say 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:54.830
