00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
is by dipping for many dips which means

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.460 
is by dipping for many dips which means
you<00:01:33.070> put<00:01:33.400> it<00:01:33.520> in

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
dye bath and pull it out and that's when

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.770 
dye bath and pull it out and that's when
the<00:01:37.830> you<00:01:38.280> know<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.550> color<00:01:38.790> gets<00:01:39.000> oxidized<00:01:39.600> and

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
the you know the color gets oxidized and

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.050 
the you know the color gets oxidized and
it<00:01:39.870> comes<00:01:40.080> to<00:01:40.290> be<00:01:40.410> blue<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.430> wash<00:01:41.640> it<00:01:41.910> and

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
it comes to be blue and you wash it and

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.290 
it comes to be blue and you wash it and
you<00:01:42.210> dry<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.810> we<00:01:43.800> did<00:01:44.040> that<00:01:44.280> about<00:01:44.490> 12<00:01:45.060> times

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.300 
you dry and we did that about 12 times

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.660 
you dry and we did that about 12 times
which<00:01:45.810> requires<00:01:46.320> about<00:01:46.530> 12<00:01:46.920> days<00:01:47.130> of<00:01:47.370> dyeing

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
which requires about 12 days of dyeing

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.990 
which requires about 12 days of dyeing
and<00:01:47.970> then<00:01:48.720> we<00:01:49.140> were<00:01:49.290> able<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.710> over<00:01:50.370> die

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
and then we were able to over die

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.110 
and then we were able to over die
these<00:01:51.540> Indigo's<00:01:52.320> in<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:52.920> get<00:01:53.160> get<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:53.850> these

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:54.120 
these Indigo's in to get get to these

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.540 
these Indigo's in to get get to these
darkest<00:01:54.750> blue

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.170 

I<00:01:57.610> think<00:01:58.210> the<00:01:58.510> life<00:01:58.810> of<00:01:59.140> this<00:01:59.350> blue<00:01:59.670> has<00:02:00.670> its

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
I think the life of this blue has its

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:07.140 
I think the life of this blue has its
own<00:02:03.330> artistic<00:02:04.330> life<00:02:05.160> by<00:02:06.160> the<00:02:06.220> wearers<00:02:06.790> who

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
own artistic life by the wearers who

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.540 
own artistic life by the wearers who
wear<00:02:07.360> them<00:02:07.630> and<00:02:07.900> I<00:02:08.290> think<00:02:08.619> I<00:02:08.710> love<00:02:08.979> the<00:02:09.160> memory

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
wear them and I think I love the memory

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.540 
wear them and I think I love the memory
and<00:02:09.910> the<00:02:10.690> wearer's<00:02:11.110> memory<00:02:11.710> that<00:02:11.950> gets<00:02:12.160> to<00:02:12.400> be

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
and the wearer's memory that gets to be

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.050 
and the wearer's memory that gets to be
in<00:02:12.790> this<00:02:13.060> dark<00:02:13.360> blue<00:02:13.540> indigo
