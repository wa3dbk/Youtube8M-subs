00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.080 

okay<00:00:01.410> now<00:00:01.560> we'll<00:00:01.709> be<00:00:01.800> looking<00:00:01.979> at<00:00:02.340> the<00:00:02.669> half

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
okay now we'll be looking at the half

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.900 
okay now we'll be looking at the half
brain<00:00:03.720> model<00:00:04.259> first<00:00:05.220> we're<00:00:05.460> going<00:00:05.549> to<00:00:05.609> go<00:00:05.759> over

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
brain model first we're going to go over

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.930 
brain model first we're going to go over
all<00:00:06.120> four<00:00:06.509> regions<00:00:07.200> of<00:00:07.470> the<00:00:07.710> brain<00:00:07.950> so<00:00:08.880> you

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
all four regions of the brain so you

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.680 
all four regions of the brain so you
start<00:00:09.330> with<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:09.809> cerebrum<00:00:11.030> then<00:00:12.030> you<00:00:12.540> have

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
start with the cerebrum then you have

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.260 
start with the cerebrum then you have
the<00:00:12.870> cerebellum<00:00:14.389> brain<00:00:15.389> stem<00:00:15.990> and

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:17.270 
the cerebellum brain stem and

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.269 
the cerebellum brain stem and
diencephalon<00:00:18.770> alright<00:00:19.770> so<00:00:19.920> now<00:00:20.039> we're<00:00:20.160> going

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
diencephalon alright so now we're going

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.220 
diencephalon alright so now we're going
to<00:00:20.340> go<00:00:20.460> back<00:00:20.609> over<00:00:20.670> structures<00:00:21.510> so<00:00:22.080> we'll

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
to go back over structures so we'll

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.529 
to go back over structures so we'll
start<00:00:22.500> back<00:00:22.680> with<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:23.039> cerebrum<00:00:23.670> region<00:00:24.359> and

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
start back with the cerebrum region and

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.839 
start back with the cerebrum region and
our<00:00:24.990> first<00:00:25.230> structure<00:00:25.859> is<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.369> corpus

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
our first structure is the corpus

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.450 
our first structure is the corpus
callosum<00:00:27.710> remember<00:00:28.710> this<00:00:28.890> is<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.130> type<00:00:29.429> of

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
callosum remember this is a type of

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.820 
callosum remember this is a type of
kamesha<00:00:30.029> this<00:00:30.779> is<00:00:30.960> what<00:00:31.140> allows<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.650> right

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
kamesha this is what allows the right

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.520 
kamesha this is what allows the right
and<00:00:32.009> left<00:00:32.250> brain<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.669> talk<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:33.059> each<00:00:33.210> other

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
and left brain to talk to each other

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.580 
and left brain to talk to each other
this<00:00:34.530> space<00:00:35.100> right<00:00:35.760> here<00:00:35.820> is<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.840> lateral

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
this space right here is the lateral

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.729 
this space right here is the lateral
ventricle<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:38.760> then<00:00:39.719> this<00:00:39.989> white<00:00:40.469> portion

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
ventricle and then this white portion

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.119 
ventricle and then this white portion
right<00:00:41.129> here<00:00:41.430> is<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.879> fornix<00:00:42.739> so<00:00:43.739> you<00:00:43.829> have<00:00:44.010> the

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
right here is the fornix so you have the

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.500 
right here is the fornix so you have the
region<00:00:44.610> cerebrum<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:46.079> corpus<00:00:46.770> callosum<00:00:47.510> the

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
region cerebrum the corpus callosum the

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.189 
region cerebrum the corpus callosum the
lateral<00:00:49.110> ventricle<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:50.309> fornix<00:00:51.140> okay<00:00:52.140> so

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
lateral ventricle and the fornix okay so

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.750 
lateral ventricle and the fornix okay so
now<00:00:52.530> we're<00:00:52.739> going<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:52.890> move<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.520> the

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
now we're going to move to the

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.680 
now we're going to move to the
diencephalon<00:00:54.090> region<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.760> here<00:00:56.760> we<00:00:57.149> can<00:00:57.360> see

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
diencephalon region and here we can see

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.360 
diencephalon region and here we can see
the<00:00:58.410> pituitary<00:00:58.829> and<00:01:00.109> the<00:01:01.109> stalk<00:01:01.500> which<00:01:02.039> is<00:01:02.219> the

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
the pituitary and the stalk which is the

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.149 
the pituitary and the stalk which is the
inven<00:01:02.789> dib<00:01:03.030> ulam<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.449> then<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:04.530> attaches<00:01:04.890> to

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
inven dib ulam and then that attaches to

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.649 
inven dib ulam and then that attaches to
the<00:01:05.460> hypothalamus<00:01:06.740> from<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.830> hypothalamus

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
the hypothalamus from the hypothalamus

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.890 
the hypothalamus from the hypothalamus
go<00:01:09.659> across<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.710> you<00:01:11.280> can<00:01:11.460> see<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:12.510> pineal

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
go across and you can see the pineal

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.940 
go across and you can see the pineal
body<00:01:12.960> or<00:01:13.470> EPI<00:01:14.280> thalamus<00:01:14.960> then<00:01:15.960> we<00:01:16.470> can<00:01:16.650> find

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
body or EPI thalamus then we can find

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.580 
body or EPI thalamus then we can find
the<00:01:17.340> thalamus<00:01:17.700> which<00:01:18.479> is<00:01:18.720> this<00:01:18.930> region<00:01:19.200> in

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
the thalamus which is this region in

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.070 
the thalamus which is this region in
here<00:01:20.390> so<00:01:21.390> remember<00:01:21.750> there<00:01:21.930> are<00:01:21.960> three

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
here so remember there are three

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.310 
here so remember there are three
structures<00:01:22.860> found<00:01:23.130> in<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.430> diencephalon

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
structures found in the diencephalon

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.480 
structures found in the diencephalon
pineal<00:01:25.320> body<00:01:26.330> thalamus<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.630> hypothalamus

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
pineal body thalamus and hypothalamus

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.760 
pineal body thalamus and hypothalamus
and<00:01:29.490> remember<00:01:30.420> finding<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.930> hypothalamus

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
and remember finding the hypothalamus

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.100 
and remember finding the hypothalamus
you<00:01:31.950> want<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.220> start<00:01:32.490> with<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.700> pituitary

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
you want to start with the pituitary

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.990 
you want to start with the pituitary
then<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.320> infundibulum<00:01:34.650> then<00:01:35.640> the

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
then the infundibulum then the

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.630 
then the infundibulum then the
hypothalamus<00:01:36.829> and<00:01:37.829> remember<00:01:38.340> that<00:01:38.520> the

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
hypothalamus and remember that the

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.200 
hypothalamus and remember that the
diencephalon<00:01:38.970> is<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:39.900> hollow<00:01:40.320> structure<00:01:40.799> it

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
diencephalon is a hollow structure it

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.660 
diencephalon is a hollow structure it
surrounds<00:01:42.210> the<00:01:42.450> third<00:01:42.869> ventricle<00:01:43.670> so

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
surrounds the third ventricle so

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.639 
surrounds the third ventricle so
remember<00:01:44.970> we<00:01:45.090> had<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.360> lateral<00:01:45.899> ventricle<00:01:46.439> up

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
remember we had the lateral ventricle up

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.319 
remember we had the lateral ventricle up
here<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.189> this<00:01:48.149> is<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.720> third<00:01:49.229> ventricle

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:50.329 
here and this is the third ventricle

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:52.789 
here and this is the third ventricle
okay<00:01:51.329> so<00:01:51.390> now<00:01:51.689> we're<00:01:51.869> going<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.020> move<00:01:52.259> into<00:01:52.560> the

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
okay so now we're going to move into the

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.370 
okay so now we're going to move into the
brainstem<00:01:53.340> structures<00:01:53.990> we<00:01:54.990> have<00:01:55.159> midbrain

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
brainstem structures we have midbrain

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.789 
brainstem structures we have midbrain
then<00:01:58.380> we<00:01:58.649> have<00:01:58.829> pons<00:01:59.189> medulla<00:01:59.869> oblongata<00:02:00.869> and

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
then we have pons medulla oblongata and

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.240 
then we have pons medulla oblongata and
then<00:02:02.610> that<00:02:02.790> blends<00:02:03.060> into<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.420> spinal<00:02:03.780> cord

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
then that blends into the spinal cord

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.979 
then that blends into the spinal cord
here<00:02:05.250> you<00:02:05.640> can<00:02:05.790> see<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.479> fourth<00:02:06.930> ventricle

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
here you can see the fourth ventricle

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.710 
here you can see the fourth ventricle
moving<00:02:09.989> back<00:02:10.170> up<00:02:10.410> here<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.099> our<00:02:11.280> midbrain<00:02:11.879> you

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
moving back up here to our midbrain you

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.040 
moving back up here to our midbrain you
can<00:02:12.900> see<00:02:13.110> the<00:02:13.319> corpora<00:02:13.830> quadrigemina<00:02:14.099> and

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
can see the corpora quadrigemina and

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.600 
can see the corpora quadrigemina and
notice<00:02:16.050> that<00:02:16.170> the<00:02:16.319> little<00:02:16.470> pineal<00:02:16.920> body<00:02:16.980> from

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
notice that the little pineal body from

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.430 
notice that the little pineal body from
the<00:02:17.730> diencephalon<00:02:18.030> is<00:02:18.629> poking<00:02:19.110> out<00:02:19.200> right

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
the diencephalon is poking out right

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.890 
the diencephalon is poking out right
behind<00:02:19.830> it<00:02:20.150> all<00:02:21.150> right<00:02:21.239> so<00:02:21.420> let's<00:02:21.599> do<00:02:21.750> those

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
behind it all right so let's do those

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.869 
behind it all right so let's do those
structures<00:02:22.349> one<00:02:22.560> more<00:02:22.739> time<00:02:23.010> you<00:02:23.730> have

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 
structures one more time you have

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:28.339 
structures one more time you have
midbrain<00:02:25.099> corpora<00:02:26.099> quadrigemina<00:02:27.349> pons

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
midbrain corpora quadrigemina pons
