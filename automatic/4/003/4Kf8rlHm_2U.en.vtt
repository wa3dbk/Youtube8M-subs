00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.210
 a new case of the skin disease of 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.040
 Crystal arrived at the hospital of Santa Cruz 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:10.740
 it's about the young pedro a driss or the 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.039
 usual of 16 years coming from the 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.470
 commune of chépica a pedro is not foreign 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:18.750
 the aforementioned health care facility since 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.960
 in this establishment it was attended from 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.170
 the child later on advancing his age and his 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.910
 illness was transferred to santiago 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:30.490
 supported by the foundation of seeing chile 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.220
 Like good is a bit difficult 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.050
 first because without knowing what was happening 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.309
 we thought that this was going to happen from a 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.820
 day for another because it was always thought 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:42.220
 it was an allergy and well we have 16 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.989
 years waiting for it to happen and it does not happen 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:47.559
 it turned out to be a skin disease 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:49.690
 a dominant bullous epidermolysis 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:51.650
 dystrophic as they call him he loses 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.440
 children lose glass 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:58.640
 and Napo has meant a lot 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:02.270
 total in one's life changes 100% 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.820
 and have this strength high support for 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.010
 be able to keep going because the day to 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.990
 day all right every day there 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.320
 sufferings every day a pain 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.659
 every day and a wound 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.820
 I believe that one gets ahead thanks to 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.050
 the strength of my family from my other son 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.840
 of my husband 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.180
 my dad then like that is hard it is 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.580
 strong but I think a lot of people 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.380
 question they say that a lot of people 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.000
 He tells me they would not live or have 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.710
 a child like that because he says it's difficult 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.410
 I believe that not yet the day to day what 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.240
 This young man teaches since he was born 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.850

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.400
 disease I have done that however not 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.520
 It has been a hindrance to study or to 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.110
 travel and meet important people because 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.420
