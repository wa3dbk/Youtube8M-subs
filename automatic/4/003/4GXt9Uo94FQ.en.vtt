00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.550
 first the application as here by 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.079
 Julian's apps here 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.660
 configuration to quickly reach the 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.760
 play store and we're going to look here for the 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.750
 candy crush here is written is written 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.950
 in this way I had already searched 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.990
 previously indicated 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:49.160
 it is the first option that appears here 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:51.530
 that says editor's choice of king.com 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.780
 we go here we quickly click 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.270
 and as we can see here here is the 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.820
 size of the application is to 42 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.830
 megabytes is an application that already has 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.059
 more than 100,000 downloads is a 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.940
 application that is in very good 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:07.850
 increases the whole world had as I do 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.680
 Click on install the Samsung Galaxy S3 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.320
 they have a lot of memory capacity so 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.540
 we have no problems with that of this 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.119
 application also has a good 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.350
 ram's ability to reach you so 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:20.869
 this application will work very well 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.330
 in that team they have already been 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:24.619
 previously in the there this law 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.479
 to organize it for you 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:29.570
 Basically this game is very much like 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.940
 what is the tetris here a screen 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.490
 that he can not explain to you while 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.440
 download the game from this screen as 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.130
 see how the game mode the screen 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:42.229
 egg and basically pro cures appear 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.930
 tools is like its name that's called 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:48.540
 hugo candy cast and consists as I said 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:51.680
 very similar to tetris to create or search 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:57.300
 online three of the same candy or of 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:58.980
 490 nl and basically in tetris the 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.010
 security goes down now and we 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:04.170
 we accommodate working while and here 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.810
 they appear already on screen I had to go 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.690
 eliminating bamba symptoms sweet and 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.550
 the game is to perform 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.680
 Exchanges of fruit salt for example 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.330
 here where are these two yellow yo 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.420
 could exchange this way with 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.780
 green and make a line 3 of pure 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.550
 yellow and with a charm the ideal is 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.250
 make lines of 4 since when we do 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.560
 line of four come out rustic or sweet 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.780
 wild cards which allow us to 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.430
 soon do what is happening here 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.170
 in this photo that a whole 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:39.450
 column or a whole time the same one joins the 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:42.770
 sweet as you see we have let's see 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.770
 if the frost has already ended 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.260
 and at this moment it is already being installed 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.360
 marbles uninstalled candid installed 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:59.520
 correctly 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.520
 let's quickly enter the egg 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.360
 let's see already settled here is here 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:10.000
 you are already starting and loading the game 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:12.099
 basically that's it for this video 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.019
 if they want to leave the video as well as 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:16.450
 see a little bit what is the 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:19.209
 initialization of this game basically 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.670
 here he says to me to play I can enter here 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:24.220
 for playing as we can see the game 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.950
 has as a map a map of pure 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.340
 seasons 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:31.310
 I'm not wrong has more than 100 more than 100 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.230
 levels 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:36.830
 The idea is to go through each level 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.540
 to finish this whole map in the 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:41.300
 first levels give us as a 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.550
 small introduction of how to play the 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.380
 game 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:49.230
 let's do the first level no more 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:49.230
 as for there as here one 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.810
 so this game as I told you is a 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.640
 game by levels which a goal of 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.460
 In this case, the objective is to reach the 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.430
 300 points and that will give us a 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:06.010
 limit of number of movements 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.409
 in this case here it teaches us how it is 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.670
 how is it turned this pouring game 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:11.129
 basically it consists of doing 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.329
 exchanges in lines of three 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:14.439
 exchanging criticism from the first 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:17.079
 level of teaching how here 

00:04:14.439 --> 00:04:19.959
 we exchanged and so quickly did we 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:21.549
 several points and let's consider another 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:23.380
 another important thing about these 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:26.530
 movements that we have a limit of 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.300
 movements we can not do more than 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.669
 movements that says here or if not 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.729
 we will lose a life here we are going to do 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:35.339
 another movement 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:37.199
 that increased our score of 600 

00:04:35.339 --> 00:04:39.449
 quickly we already meet the objective 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:42.379
 that it was 300 like to keep eliminating 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:42.379
 here practices 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:49.170
 and so we have simply passed the 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:52.560
 unit basically that's what is the 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:54.180
 candy cash on the samsung galaxy s3 will see 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.890
 They look great and play very well
