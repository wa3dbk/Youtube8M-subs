00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.740
 and we're going to need a plate of 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:09.530
 puff pastry already prepared bought made 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:11.880
 half a liter of cream to assemble 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.370
 75 grams of sugar that we are going to 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.590
 need to sweeten the cream a 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.880
 tablespoon of cocoa powder without 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:23.189
 sugar 150 grams of pure chocolate for 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.340
 to bathe the canutillos an egg that we are going 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.410
 to brush the before baking cream 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.710
 pastry that I had already prepared 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.739
 a recipe earlier my recipe you can 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.920
 find in the apple pie and let's 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.590
 to need some utensils that are about 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.739
 Tinned canutillos a few sleeves 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:47.370
 Disposable cakes or a sheet of 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:50.070
 Vegetable paper curly nozzles one 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.750
 spatula a pizza cutter that's going 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.090
 to come in handy to cut the mass of 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:58.120
 puff pastry and some rods to mount 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:00.730
 Well the first thing is to make the strips with 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.400
 the puff pastry strips about one 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:07.350
 inch and a half that we're going to try 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.350
 that they do not all go more or less the same 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:17.360
 we have them cut and now we are going to 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:21.120
 proceed to wrap them in the caldillo 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:23.580
 we are going to separate them and this is very 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.240
 easy just tighten here a little bit 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.869
 the tip 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:31.800
 and folding overlapping a little so that 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.740
 you stay 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:37.770
 and here we press a little bit we are going to 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.920
 use the egg that we already had shake 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.620
 and we 're going to paint it and that's what we're going to do 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.070
 putting already with the egg in the tray 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.070
 to bake 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:55.380
 I've put the oven to preheat to 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:59.370
 200 degrees we're going to bake that 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.760
 temperature 15 minutes and once 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:05.220
 baked, we're going to let them cool 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:07.440
 to fill those that are cold 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:11.730
 the egg will give you a nice color 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:14.550
 gold and a note the reeds or 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.190
 molds do not have to be put neither oil nor 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.290
 butter since the puff pastry has 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.200
 a lot of butter and they are going to unmold 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:26.460
 very easily we will put them in 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.410
 the oven at 200 degrees 15 minutes 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.660
 while they cook our 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.580
 canutillo let's ride the cream let's go 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.040
 use half a liter of cream to 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:38.190
 Special to assemble with a minimum of 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:41.010
 35% fat must be very 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:44.550
 very cold at home but always with the 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:47.780
 we will put rods contraption 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.780
 the sugar 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.920
 first we will start at low speed 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.040
 and now we will be increasing little by little 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.300
 we are increasing the candle 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.950
 and we can not separate from the cream 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.170
 and there is a moment that is already assembled and 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.540
 if we continue counting it will become 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.650
 butter with which a little bit here 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.650
 until it is present 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.730
 to natalia we have it stanic statesman 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.640
 Well, as we already have the cream well 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.129
 mounted that is well firm we are going to 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.560
 divide in two parts approximately 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:40.840
 We will leave a part of it reserved in 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.879
 the fridge until we go to it 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.190
 use and with the other part we are going to 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:47.080
 make the truffle 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.880
 Well, we are going to make the truffle 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:52.210
 the following way we have the cream 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.610
 assembled sugary and this sugar is that is 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:56.440
 forgive this cocoa without sugar the cocoa 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.490
 pure powder then we're going to 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.500
 walk so they do not have lumps 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:03.900
 and we're going to mix what the 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.580
 with the cream until we have the 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.790
 point of cocoa flavor that we 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.790
 we want 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:13.310
 well we have it almost we're going to mix 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.989
 very well and we will let it rest 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.630
 also in the fridge until the moment of 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:19.250
 serve have passed the 15 minutes and already 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:22.160
 we have baked them have been 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:25.090
 the precious and we set the oven 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.090
 let's unmold 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:34.930
 Be careful not to burn ourselves, take the tin 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:34.930
 and leave with this facility 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.710
 let's melt the chocolate in this 

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:46.780
 I'm going to melt it in the microwave 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:50.110
 but it can also be done in a bain-marie 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:52.060
 let's put it inside the microwave and what 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.300
 we are going to have for space first of a 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.310
 minute 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.560
 with a minute like the oven was 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:00.319
 hot from having made the canutillos 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:02.810
 because with a minute it has been enough already 

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:04.550
 we have a perfect texture if we do not know 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.500
 it cools while we use it it 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:09.050
 put some seconds back in the 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:11.560
 microwave and you give it a warm tap 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.560
 and nothing happens 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:18.510
 of baking two batches of canutillos with 

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:22.240
 so that we see a good tray 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:24.960
 let's take a spoon and go to 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:28.590
 pringar only half of the canutillo 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.590
 let's drain 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:34.260
 so that it does not have an excess of 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.260
 saying 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:40.150
 Let's follow for all 

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:46.270
 we are going to put them on paper 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:48.069
 vegetable so they do not stick to any 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.599
 surface that we want and now when 

00:05:48.069 --> 00:05:51.669
 we have them all we are going to leave 

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:54.159
 inside the refrigerator until the 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:56.280
 chocolate is hard and has curdled and 

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:58.500
 then we will fill 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.180
 now when we have them all 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:02.850
 let's put inside the fridge up 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:05.900
 that the chocolate is hardened and 

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:05.900
 we will fill it 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:20.320
 we already have them we are going to put them in the 

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.550
 refrigerator a little while and when the 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:24.830
 chocolate that we see that it has 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:27.410
 hardened we fill it 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:30.170
 well we already have them cold and we are going to 

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:33.550
 proceed to fill them with a mouthpiece 

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:33.550
 curly filling the sleeves 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:41.200
 and now 

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:43.139
 Thus we standing on the source 

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:45.419
 to serve 

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:47.100
 We will fill this first layer with 

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:49.460
 cream 

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:53.060
 and we're going to put it here in the 

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:53.060
 serving tray 

00:06:54.729 --> 00:06:59.390
 now let's make another batch stuffed 

00:06:57.189 --> 00:07:02.650
 truffle 

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:02.650
 let's go placing 

00:07:07.169 --> 00:07:11.210
 and now another batch of custard 

00:07:17.639 --> 00:07:22.789
 well we already have all and we are going to 

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.789
 prepare to start 

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:28.710
 Well, here we have the result of
