English<00:00:42.660> so<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.110> watched<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.770> rest<00:00:43.950> of<00:00:44.070> the

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
English so I watched the rest of the

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.910 
English so I watched the rest of the
episode<00:00:44.719> I<00:00:46.100> enjoyed<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.129> again<00:00:48.410> but<00:00:49.410> not

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
episode I enjoyed it again but not

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.889
