and complementary colors the fact is the

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:21.350 
and complementary colors the fact is the
primary<00:07:20.099> colors<00:07:20.610> aren't<00:07:20.819> necessarily

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:21.360 
primary colors aren't necessarily

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.239 
primary colors aren't necessarily
natural<00:07:22.050> complementary<00:07:22.650> colors<00:07:23.039> of<00:07:23.129> each

00:07:23.239 --> 00:07:23.249 
natural complementary colors of each

00:07:23.249 --> 00:07:25.100 
natural complementary colors of each
other<00:07:23.520> which<00:07:24.029> means<00:07:24.240> they<00:07:24.330> don't<00:07:24.449> always<00:07:24.899> fit

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:25.110 
other which means they don't always fit

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:26.989 
other which means they don't always fit
together<00:07:25.379> well<00:07:25.469> well<00:07:26.099> I'm<00:07:26.310> sure<00:07:26.580> someone<00:07:26.879> will

00:07:26.989 --> 00:07:26.999 
together well well I'm sure someone will

00:07:26.999 --> 00:07:28.790 
together well well I'm sure someone will
fight<00:07:27.210> that<00:07:27.389> Superman<00:07:27.870> does<00:07:28.139> use<00:07:28.379> all<00:07:28.620> three

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:28.800 
fight that Superman does use all three

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.219 
fight that Superman does use all three
colors<00:07:29.099> the<00:07:29.669> yellow<00:07:30.060> is<00:07:30.210> a<00:07:30.300> small<00:07:30.749> portion<00:07:31.169> of

00:07:31.219 --> 00:07:31.229 
colors the yellow is a small portion of

00:07:31.229 --> 00:07:33.170 
colors the yellow is a small portion of
this<00:07:31.349> costume<00:07:31.589> also<00:07:32.309> given<00:07:32.819> the<00:07:32.879> fact<00:07:33.089> that

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:33.180 
this costume also given the fact that

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:34.519 
this costume also given the fact that
that's<00:07:33.419> one<00:07:33.629> costume<00:07:33.930> that<00:07:34.020> you<00:07:34.139> seemed

00:07:34.519 --> 00:07:34.529 
that's one costume that you seemed

00:07:34.529 --> 00:07:36.409 
that's one costume that you seemed
probably<00:07:35.249> a<00:07:35.309> billion<00:07:35.699> times<00:07:35.879> by<00:07:36.120> the<00:07:36.149> time

00:07:36.409 --> 00:07:36.419 
probably a billion times by the time

00:07:36.419 --> 00:07:38.029 
probably a billion times by the time
you're<00:07:36.629> too<00:07:36.839> so<00:07:37.379> you<00:07:37.439> already<00:07:37.800> come

00:07:38.029 --> 00:07:38.039 
you're too so you already come

00:07:38.039 --> 00:07:39.409 
you're too so you already come
accustomed<00:07:38.339> to<00:07:38.580> the<00:07:38.669> look<00:07:38.849> and<00:07:38.999> it<00:07:39.060> seems<00:07:39.210> much

00:07:39.409 --> 00:07:39.419 
accustomed to the look and it seems much

00:07:39.419 --> 00:07:41.300 
accustomed to the look and it seems much
more<00:07:39.479> natural<00:07:40.169> I<00:07:40.319> think<00:07:40.710> a<00:07:40.770> different<00:07:41.069> color

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:41.310 
more natural I think a different color

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:43.399 
more natural I think a different color
choice<00:07:41.639> or<00:07:41.849> overall<00:07:42.240> costing<00:07:42.779> layout<00:07:43.080> change

00:07:43.399 --> 00:07:43.409 
choice or overall costing layout change

00:07:43.409 --> 00:07:45.499 
choice or overall costing layout change
what<00:07:43.860> helped<00:07:44.099> us<00:07:44.159> overall<00:07:44.699> look<00:07:44.909> a<00:07:44.939> lot<00:07:45.240> better

00:07:45.499 --> 00:07:45.509 
what helped us overall look a lot better

00:07:45.509 --> 00:07:47.540 
what helped us overall look a lot better
and<00:07:45.870> while<00:07:46.259> everyone<00:07:46.409> did<00:07:46.830> rave<00:07:47.159> that<00:07:47.430> this

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:47.550 
and while everyone did rave that this

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:49.189 
and while everyone did rave that this
book<00:07:47.759> was<00:07:47.909> so<00:07:48.089> great<00:07:48.389> and<00:07:48.629> then<00:07:48.719> it<00:07:48.810> should<00:07:49.080> be

00:07:49.189 --> 00:07:49.199 
book was so great and then it should be

00:07:49.199 --> 00:07:51.379 
book was so great and then it should be
one<00:07:49.319> of<00:07:49.409> the<00:07:49.469> best<00:07:49.649> costume<00:07:49.919> I<00:07:50.370> think<00:07:51.120> the<00:07:51.240> fact

00:07:51.379 --> 00:07:51.389 
one of the best costume I think the fact

00:07:51.389 --> 00:07:53.029 
one of the best costume I think the fact
that<00:07:51.539> the<00:07:51.719> book<00:07:51.899> was<00:07:52.020> cancelled<00:07:52.529> by<00:07:52.589> Marvel

00:07:53.029 --> 00:07:53.039 
that the book was cancelled by Marvel

00:07:53.039 --> 00:07:55.100 
that the book was cancelled by Marvel
and<00:07:53.189> had<00:07:53.310> continually<00:07:53.939> poor<00:07:54.270> sales<00:07:54.539> proves

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:55.110 
and had continually poor sales proves

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:56.300 
and had continually poor sales proves
that<00:07:55.199> you<00:07:55.319> guys<00:07:55.469> probably<00:07:55.709> didn't<00:07:56.129> really

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:56.310 
that you guys probably didn't really

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:57.679 
that you guys probably didn't really
love<00:07:56.430> the<00:07:56.580> costume<00:07:56.939> as<00:07:57.060> much<00:07:57.270> as<00:07:57.389> you<00:07:57.509> thought
