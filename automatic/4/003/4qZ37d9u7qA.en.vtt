00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
seam allowance and then I would trim

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.979 
seam allowance and then I would trim
that<00:00:49.140> away<00:00:49.200> I<00:00:50.059> would<00:00:51.059> combine<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.750> trim

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989

there's<00:02:42.670> a<00:02:42.850> neat<00:02:43.660> trick<00:02:43.930> that<00:02:44.230> I<00:02:44.260> used<00:02:44.530> on<00:02:44.680> the

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
there's a neat trick that I used on the

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.130 
there's a neat trick that I used on the
back<00:02:44.980> of<00:02:45.130> the<00:02:45.220> skirt<00:02:45.520> it's<00:02:46.060> an<00:02:46.540> exposed<00:02:47.050> zipper

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
back of the skirt it's an exposed zipper

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.770 
back of the skirt it's an exposed zipper
treatment<00:02:47.920> and<00:02:48.130> this<00:02:48.730> protects<00:02:49.420> the<00:02:49.480> trim

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
treatment and this protects the trim

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.690 
treatment and this protects the trim
from<00:02:50.050> catching<00:02:50.350> in<00:02:50.560> the<00:02:50.620> zipper<00:02:50.950> teeth<00:02:51.100> I'm

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
from catching in the zipper teeth I'm

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.850 
from catching in the zipper teeth I'm
going<00:02:51.940> to<00:02:52.000> apply<00:02:52.270> it<00:02:52.330> to<00:02:52.480> the<00:02:52.630> zipper<00:02:52.930> on<00:02:53.110> the

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
going to apply it to the zipper on the

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.800 
going to apply it to the zipper on the
exterior<00:02:54.280> of<00:02:54.490> the<00:02:54.730> garment<00:02:55.120> with<00:02:55.450> the<00:02:55.600> seam

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.860 
a seam sealant at this point and you
want<00:03:45.700> to<00:03:45.790> liberally<00:03:46.150> dose<00:03:46.360> it<00:03:46.510> right<00:03:46.630> here<00:03:46.810> and

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
want to liberally dose it right here and

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.320 
want to liberally dose it right here and
I've<00:03:47.049> already<00:03:47.350> prepared<00:03:47.739> this<00:03:48.040> and<00:03:48.850> you<00:03:49.150> can

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 
I've already prepared this and you can

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.150 
I've already prepared this and you can
clip<00:03:49.660> through<00:03:49.870> the<00:03:50.080> seam<00:03:50.290> allowances<00:03:50.860> there

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.710 

so<00:03:54.160> you<00:03:54.250> clip<00:03:54.489> through<00:03:54.670> both<00:03:54.880> of<00:03:54.910> them<00:03:55.239> right

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
so you clip through both of them right

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:01.390 
so you clip through both of them right
up<00:03:55.870> to<00:03:56.019> that<00:03:56.170> back<00:03:56.410> tacking

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.070 

so<00:04:02.400> at<00:04:02.640> that<00:04:02.819> point<00:04:03.030> you<00:04:03.239> can<00:04:03.390> fold<00:04:03.629> open<00:04:03.840> the

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
so at that point you can fold open the

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.820 
so at that point you can fold open the
seam<00:04:04.290> allowances<00:04:04.830> you<00:04:06.379> would<00:04:07.379> remove<00:04:07.650> the

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
seam allowances you would remove the

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.040 
seam allowances you would remove the
basing<00:04:08.250> such<00:04:08.489> as<00:04:08.700> and<00:04:08.910> fold<00:04:09.690> the<00:04:09.840> seam

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
basing such as and fold the seam

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.170 
basing such as and fold the seam
allowances<00:04:10.620> from<00:04:10.739> the<00:04:10.950> wrong<00:04:11.129> side<00:04:11.160> to<00:04:12.060> the

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
allowances from the wrong side to the

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.520 
allowances from the wrong side to the
right<00:04:12.360> side<00:04:12.390> so<00:04:12.629> they<00:04:13.050> cover<00:04:13.319> the

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
right side so they cover the

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:14.780 
right side so they cover the
embellishment<00:04:14.220> where<00:04:14.340> the<00:04:14.459> zipper<00:04:14.700> is<00:04:14.760> going

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
embellishment where the zipper is going

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.060 
embellishment where the zipper is going
to<00:04:15.030> go<00:04:15.150> in<00:04:15.390> here<00:04:16.049> I<00:04:16.079> use<00:04:16.320> the<00:04:16.470> dark<00:04:16.680> stitching

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
to go in here I use the dark stitching

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.740 
to go in here I use the dark stitching
the<00:04:17.190> contrast<00:04:17.609> stitching<00:04:17.790> to<00:04:18.359> show<00:04:18.510> you<00:04:18.570> where

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
the contrast stitching to show you where

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.050 
the contrast stitching to show you where
I<00:04:18.780> base<00:04:19.139> at<00:04:19.410> those<00:04:19.590> seam<00:04:19.799> allowances<00:04:20.310> down<00:04:20.850> in

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
I base at those seam allowances down in

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.810 
I base at those seam allowances down in
place<00:04:21.299> at<00:04:22.109> this<00:04:22.440> point<00:04:22.830> you're<00:04:23.280> ready<00:04:23.430> to<00:04:23.639> sew

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:28.199 
on right over those pressed open seam

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:31.280 
on right over those pressed open seam
allowances<00:04:29.150> this<00:04:30.150> is<00:04:30.330> what<00:04:30.510> yours<00:04:30.690> will<00:04:31.260> look

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
stitch to do this and I use two rows of

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.370 
stitch to do this and I use two rows of
stitching<00:04:41.850> close<00:04:42.479> to<00:04:42.630> the<00:04:42.690> zipper<00:04:42.840> teeth<00:04:43.139> and

close to the zipper tape edge what this
does<00:04:46.740> is<00:04:47.160> when<00:04:47.580> you<00:04:47.820> open<00:04:48.120> the<00:04:48.210> zipper<00:04:48.510> you<00:04:48.960> can
