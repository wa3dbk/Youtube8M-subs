00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
like really awesome footage so I decided

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.269 
like really awesome footage so I decided
to<00:00:27.380> just<00:00:28.380> go<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.560> theater<00:00:28.830> mode<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.130> just

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
to just go to theater mode and just

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.310 
to just go to theater mode and just
fraps<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:30.000> good<00:00:30.359> parts<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:30.779> upload<00:00:31.170> that

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
fraps the good parts and upload that

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.770 
fraps the good parts and upload that
it's<00:00:31.800> really<00:00:32.040> small<00:00:32.250> clip<00:00:32.489> it's<00:00:33.059> about<00:00:33.450> four

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
it's really small clip it's about four

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.270 
it's really small clip it's about four
minutes<00:00:33.930> long<00:00:34.110> I<00:00:34.290> think<00:00:34.350> so<00:00:34.800> it's<00:00:35.010> not<00:00:35.130> that

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
minutes long I think so it's not that

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.790 
minutes long I think so it's not that
big<00:00:35.399> don't<00:00:35.700> fit<00:00:35.880> like<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.090> huge<00:00:36.300> video<00:00:36.620> but<00:00:37.620> it's

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
big don't fit like a huge video but it's

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.709 
big don't fit like a huge video but it's
good<00:00:38.040> footage<00:00:38.370> it's<00:00:38.640> like<00:00:38.850> she's<00:00:39.420> pretty<00:00:39.600> much

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.410 
good footage it's like she's pretty much
just<00:00:39.809> like<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:39.989> compacted<00:00:40.969> awesomeness<00:00:41.969> video

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420
