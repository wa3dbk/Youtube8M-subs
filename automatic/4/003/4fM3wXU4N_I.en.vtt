original one you just get your katana
it's<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.549> bit<00:01:23.939> easy<00:01:24.299> because<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:25.020> have<00:01:25.200> this

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
it's a bit easy because you have this

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.980 
it's a bit easy because you have this
ninpo<00:01:25.820> magic<00:01:26.820> that<00:01:27.150> uh<00:01:28.130> what<00:01:29.130> is<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.990> dragon

ninpo magic that uh what is it a dragon

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.219 
ninpo magic that uh what is it a dragon
that<00:01:31.909> clears<00:01:32.909> out<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.180> whole<00:01:33.509> room<00:01:33.810> for<00:01:34.110> you

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
that clears out the whole room for you

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:42.280 
that clears out the whole room for you
then<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:34.740> get<00:01:34.890> this<00:01:35.960> cursed<00:01:36.960> arm<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:38.299> it's

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.730 

and<00:01:43.369> it<00:01:44.369> basically<00:01:44.610> wipes<00:01:45.390> out<00:01:45.750> like<00:01:46.409> three

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
and it basically wipes out like three

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.280 
and it basically wipes out like three
enemies<00:01:47.100> at<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.310> time<00:01:47.640> so<00:01:48.119> it's<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.540> little<00:01:49.020> bit

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
enemies at a time so it's a little bit

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.020 
enemies at a time so it's a little bit
too<00:01:49.500> easy<00:01:51.890> but<00:01:52.890> if<00:01:53.130> you're<00:01:53.460> new<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.640> Ninja
