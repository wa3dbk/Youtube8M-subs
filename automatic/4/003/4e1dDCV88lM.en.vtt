00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.690
 I want to show you a data 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:11.570
 interesting is that on this highway 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.570
 op brings this already outdated face 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:18.289
 the speed I'm 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:21.730
 seventy per hour 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:25.839
 look at instant spot consumption 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.839
 this is in the album 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.110
 18 black dots a lot afterwards I 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.309
 I will push the button gives for us to get 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.290
 in average 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:42.150
 you see what the average consumption is 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:45.950
 but I'm 70's not because I want to 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.950
 Look, look the way ahead. 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:52.670
 here is a stretch where there are trucks 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.500
 then you become bound in this 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.290
 velocity 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.120
 The interesting thing is that the car in gasoline 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:05.620
 I already got to do 25 kilometers 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.620
 politicians and not something around 15 14 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.350
 now imagine if you did not have this 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.100
 I'm going to show you a truck. 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.570
 mirror 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.450
 Look when the guy who comes behind is 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.799
 pasted on Sunday at the distance that 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.920
 front car a distance of 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.920
 safety 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.850
 but the one behind it comes leaning against it naked 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:42.350
 they another passage he wants here 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.659
 Good, let's try to continue listening here. 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:48.039
 oh another truck 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.039
 seventy per hour 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:52.030
 the way ahead 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:05.320
 again madness madness continuous track 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.610
 The hustling cheat looks at the license plate. 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.900
 forbidden to over look that the 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.500
 flagrant 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:13.570
 and hey that's a beautiful car there this 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.590
 our roads here in the interior of 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.350
 Paulo 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.540
 the limit of 80 but who respects 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.550
 Beauty, I 'm not here for this to talk 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.770
 no one here to show the 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:27.690
 consumption of my car 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.690
 the government was able to be like this 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:38.580
 let's get back to average average consume 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.580
 milk 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.880
 again showing that we are following 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:49.270
 the truck there is no possibility of 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:54.970
 go over here is in a safe way 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:57.670
 in a way that not that I'm not 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:02.010
 single kingdom in the case because the range is 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.010
 continuous no track selected 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.069
 Look, look what he 's doing to 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.300
 try to make it easier for people but let's go 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.780
 will exceed 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.780
 John 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:31.090
 coming back here because the average consumption 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:34.150
 people remembering that I 'm walking with 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:37.480
 alcohol is not gasoline 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:40.360
 Look at the car 's consumption is the most 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.580
 economic face Brazil undoubtedly the 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:47.760
 I'll show you guys, guys. 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:52.069
 now looks after traveling 21 kilometers 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.069
 on average 64 km per hour 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.900
 we will see 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:05.260
 we spent 1.4 liters 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:09.819
 would be a liter and a half of alcohol made 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:11.560
 average of 14,800 chosen is great one 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:15.750
 car of this size 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:18.250
 a big car tire rim 16 with tires 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:21.519
 205 wide 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:23.500
 usually in any car 1.0 car 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:27.120
 neither walk upright nor have much strength 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:31.110
 with the tire of this width but summarizing 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.110
 look average consumption 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:38.450
 we have 100 kilometers we can see 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:41.650
 that has no fuel is in the bone of the 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.650
