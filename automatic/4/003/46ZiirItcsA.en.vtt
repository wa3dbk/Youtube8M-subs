car for the globe the car itself we

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.590 
car for the globe the car itself we
wanted<00:00:42.219> to<00:00:42.399> differentiate<00:00:42.789> from<00:00:43.270> other

products in the marketplace more dynamic
more<00:00:47.200> exciting<00:00:47.770> we<00:00:48.280> focused<00:00:49.210> a<00:00:49.390> lot<00:00:49.750> on<00:00:50.010> the

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
more exciting we focused a lot on the

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.639 
more exciting we focused a lot on the
aerodynamic<00:00:51.940> aspect<00:00:52.480> of<00:00:52.660> it<00:00:52.810> because<00:00:53.200> it<00:00:53.440> does

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:53.649 
aerodynamic aspect of it because it does

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:57.060 
aerodynamic aspect of it because it does
equate<00:00:54.280> to<00:00:54.550> fuel<00:00:55.270> efficiency<00:00:55.899> and<00:00:56.649> I<00:00:56.800> think

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
equate to fuel efficiency and I think

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.520 
equate to fuel efficiency and I think
this<00:00:57.190> is<00:00:57.250> the<00:00:57.399> beauty<00:00:57.880> about<00:00:58.110> what<00:00:59.110> we've<00:00:59.290> done

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
this is the beauty about what we've done

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.520 
this is the beauty about what we've done
here<00:00:59.590> with<00:01:00.100> the<00:01:00.220> EcoSport<00:01:00.880> and<00:01:01.120> we<00:01:01.510> utilized<00:01:02.170> a

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
here with the EcoSport and we utilized a

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.679 
here with the EcoSport and we utilized a
lot<00:01:02.739> of<00:01:02.920> this<00:01:03.160> to<00:01:03.700> come<00:01:03.910> up<00:01:04.059> with<00:01:04.269> a<00:01:04.299> product

00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:04.689 
lot of this to come up with a product

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:08.550 
lot of this to come up with a product
that<00:01:05.310> looks<00:01:06.310> right<00:01:06.549> in<00:01:06.790> India<00:01:07.210> but<00:01:08.110> it<00:01:08.259> also

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
that looks right in India but it also

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.240 
that looks right in India but it also
works<00:01:09.340> very<00:01:09.520> well<00:01:09.820> in<00:01:10.030> downtown<00:01:10.719> sell<00:01:10.990> power

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
I'm sure that this design it's going to

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.139 
I'm sure that this design it's going to
hit<00:01:14.829> the<00:01:15.130> market<00:01:15.159> it's<00:01:15.729> going<00:01:15.909> to<00:01:16.000> be

00:01:16.139 --> 00:01:16.149 
hit the market it's going to be

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:17.639 
hit the market it's going to be
something<00:01:16.420> completely<00:01:16.719> different<00:01:17.350> than

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:17.649 
something completely different than
