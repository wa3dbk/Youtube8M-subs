that's<00:00:19.060> the<00:00:19.330> end<00:00:19.480> of<00:00:19.689> the<00:00:19.930> optical<00:00:20.710> zoom<00:00:23.279> and

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:24.279 
that's the end of the optical zoom and

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:38.849 
that's the end of the optical zoom and
here's<00:00:25.119> some<00:00:25.360> digital<00:00:25.869> zoom

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
and back to widen the first zoom was at

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:03.959 
and back to widen the first zoom was at
VGA<00:00:53.980> resolution<00:00:54.160> this<00:00:55.150> is<00:00:55.210> now<00:00:55.570> at<00:00:55.810> 720p

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:30.930 

and<00:01:13.450> there's<00:01:14.049> with<00:01:14.380> some<00:01:14.770> digital<00:01:15.340> zone

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:36.210 

this<00:01:31.540> is<00:01:31.750> now<00:01:31.960> at<00:01:32.460> 1080p<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:35.530> cannot<00:01:35.890> turn<00:01:36.190> off

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
this is now at 1080p you cannot turn off

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
the digital zoom on the Camellia X 400

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.170 
the digital zoom on the Camellia X 400
it<00:01:40.870> actually<00:01:41.440> just<00:01:41.740> pauses<00:01:42.580> as<00:01:42.910> you're

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
it actually just pauses as you're

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.690 
it actually just pauses as you're
zooming<00:01:43.810> when<00:01:44.170> you<00:01:44.290> reach<00:01:44.500> the<00:01:44.770> end<00:01:45.010> of<00:01:45.340> the

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
zooming when you reach the end of the

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:53.429 
zooming when you reach the end of the
optical<00:01:46.420> zoom

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:57.029 

see<00:01:54.009> there<00:01:54.219> it's<00:01:54.369> paused<00:01:54.759> at<00:01:55.329> the<00:01:55.710> end<00:01:56.710> of<00:01:56.920> the

00:01:57.029 --> 00:01:57.039 
see there it's paused at the end of the

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:02.219 
see there it's paused at the end of the
optical<00:01:57.219> zone<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:01.270> here's<00:02:01.750> with<00:02:01.990> some

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
optical zone and here's with some

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:13.250 
optical zone and here's with some
digital<00:02:02.530> zoom

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.259 

and<00:02:13.500> as<00:02:14.430> i<00:02:14.459> zoom<00:02:14.879> out<00:02:15.120> it<00:02:15.390> paused<00:02:15.690> again<00:02:17.000> at<00:02:18.000> the

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
and as i zoom out it paused again at the

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.410 
and as i zoom out it paused again at the
start<00:02:18.330> of<00:02:18.840> optical<00:02:19.799> zoom<00:02:20.129> or<00:02:21.030> optical

wide-angle

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:37.059 

you

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.009 

this<00:02:38.069> is<00:02:38.250> the<00:02:38.400> camera<00:02:38.819> zoomed<00:02:39.120> in<00:02:39.450> with<00:02:39.780> the

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
this is the camera zoomed in with the

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.250 
this is the camera zoomed in with the
optical<00:02:40.769> stabilization<00:02:41.420> turned<00:02:42.420> on<00:02:42.810> and<00:02:43.170> the

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
optical stabilization turned on and the

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.949 
optical stabilization turned on and the
camera<00:02:43.709> is<00:02:43.799> actually<00:02:44.129> on<00:02:44.579> a<00:02:44.819> tripod<00:02:45.150> so<00:02:45.450> it's

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
camera is actually on a tripod so it's

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.009 
camera is actually on a tripod so it's
rocks<00:02:46.260> solid<00:02:47.129> right<00:02:47.310> now<00:02:47.689> but<00:02:48.689> it<00:02:48.780> looks<00:02:48.959> like

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
rocks solid right now but it looks like

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:52.599 
rocks solid right now but it looks like
the<00:02:49.549> image<00:02:50.549> stabilization<00:02:51.090> is<00:02:51.599> causing<00:02:52.140> a

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:52.609 
the image stabilization is causing a

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:56.780 
the image stabilization is causing a
image<00:02:53.609> to<00:02:53.970> hunt<00:02:54.450> a<00:02:54.629> little<00:02:54.930> bit<00:02:55.400> I'll<00:02:56.400> try<00:02:56.730> it

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
image to hunt a little bit I'll try it

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.770 
image to hunt a little bit I'll try it
next<00:02:57.180> with<00:02:57.359> the<00:02:57.590> stabilization<00:02:58.590> off<00:02:59.540> now<00:03:00.540> this

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
next with the stabilization off now this

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.710 
next with the stabilization off now this
is<00:03:00.959> the<00:03:01.170> same<00:03:01.470> scene<00:03:02.220> in<00:03:02.250> the<00:03:02.670> same<00:03:02.909> zoom<00:03:03.329> with

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
is the same scene in the same zoom with

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.580 
is the same scene in the same zoom with
the<00:03:03.750> stabilization<00:03:04.739> turned<00:03:05.159> off<00:03:05.870> it<00:03:06.870> image

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
the stabilization turned off it image

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.050 
the stabilization turned off it image
appears<00:03:07.950> to<00:03:08.099> be<00:03:08.220> a<00:03:08.250> little<00:03:08.430> more<00:03:08.639> stable

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
appears to be a little more stable

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.649 
appears to be a little more stable
although<00:03:09.689> I<00:03:09.720> think<00:03:09.930> the<00:03:11.269> autofocus<00:03:12.269> might

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:12.659 
although I think the autofocus might

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:14.449 
although I think the autofocus might
hunt<00:03:12.959> a<00:03:13.049> little<00:03:13.169> bit<00:03:13.470> but<00:03:13.680> it<00:03:13.829> appears<00:03:14.220> more

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
hunt a little bit but it appears more

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.210 
hunt a little bit but it appears more
stable<00:03:14.909> on<00:03:15.030> a<00:03:15.090> tripod<00:03:15.450> with<00:03:15.989> the

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
stable on a tripod with the

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.239 
stable on a tripod with the
stabilization<00:03:17.220> turned<00:03:17.970> off
