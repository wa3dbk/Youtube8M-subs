00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
some perspective from above we have

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.130 
some perspective from above we have

stream of water down into this cafeteria

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:15.410 
stream of water down into this cafeteria
now<00:02:12.500> before<00:02:13.500> we<00:02:13.650> can<00:02:13.830> see<00:02:14.099> how<00:02:14.370> there<00:02:15.150> is<00:02:15.330> a

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
now before we can see how there is a

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.729 
now before we can see how there is a
concept<00:02:15.780> ility<00:02:16.140> that<00:02:16.319> more<00:02:16.500> than<00:02:16.620> one

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
concept ility that more than one

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.530 
concept ility that more than one
building<00:02:17.010> may<00:02:17.160> be<00:02:17.220> affected<00:02:17.819> here<00:02:18.060> we<00:02:18.299> don't

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
building may be affected here we don't

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.910 
building may be affected here we don't
have<00:02:18.720> any<00:02:18.840> confirmation<00:02:19.170> of<00:02:19.500> that<00:02:19.560> it<00:02:19.769> could

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
have any confirmation of that it could

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.530 
have any confirmation of that it could
be<00:02:20.040> just<00:02:20.220> one<00:02:20.400> massive<00:02:20.610> complex<00:02:21.239> here<00:02:21.390> but

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
be just one massive complex here but

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.259 
be just one massive complex here but
there<00:02:22.230> is<00:02:22.410> just<00:02:22.590> a<00:02:22.769> lot<00:02:23.160> of<00:02:23.489> damage<00:02:23.730> here<00:02:23.910> now

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
there is just a lot of damage here now

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:25.880 
there is just a lot of damage here now
when<00:02:24.750> he<00:02:24.840> was<00:02:24.959> talking<00:02:25.080> about<00:02:25.260> to<00:02:25.530> has<00:02:25.620> a<00:02:25.709> roof

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
when he was talking about to has a roof

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.350 
when he was talking about to has a roof
that<00:02:25.920> compromised<00:02:26.549> while<00:02:26.819> the<00:02:26.910> roof<00:02:27.030> in<00:02:27.150> fact

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
that compromised while the roof in fact

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.640 
that compromised while the roof in fact
has<00:02:27.510> been<00:02:27.540> burned<00:02:27.900> all<00:02:28.049> the<00:02:28.140> way<00:02:28.230> through<00:02:28.500> and

has been burned all the way through and

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.589 
has been burned all the way through and
so<00:02:28.709> yeah<00:02:28.890> firefighters<00:02:29.849> that<00:02:30.000> are<00:02:30.269> in

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
so yeah firefighters that are in

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:31.910 
so yeah firefighters that are in
defensive<00:02:31.049> mode<00:02:31.230> which<00:02:31.410> means<00:02:31.560> that<00:02:31.799> they

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
defensive mode which means that they

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.740 
defensive mode which means that they
have<00:02:31.950> been<00:02:32.310> removed<00:02:32.670> from<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.269> building<00:02:33.599> for

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
have been removed from the building for

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.180 
have been removed from the building for
structural<00:02:34.080> integrity<00:02:34.170> issues<00:02:34.830> they<00:02:34.980> have

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
structural integrity issues they have

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.309 
structural integrity issues they have
basically<00:02:36.090> employed<00:02:36.420> this<00:02:36.629> round<00:02:36.870> and<00:02:37.049> round

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
basically employed this round and round

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:38.900 
basically employed this round and round
that's<00:02:37.799> familiar<00:02:37.980> men<00:02:38.310> to<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.489> firefighter

that's familiar men to the firefighter

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.539 
that's familiar men to the firefighter
here<00:02:39.239> put<00:02:39.480> water<00:02:39.750> from<00:02:40.709> the<00:02:40.799> outside<00:02:40.950> again

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
here put water from the outside again

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:43.009 
here put water from the outside again
rather<00:02:41.849> than<00:02:42.060> finding<00:02:42.329> either<00:02:42.510> fire<00:02:42.720> from<00:02:42.930> the

rather than finding either fire from the
inside<00:02:43.349> as<00:02:43.530> well<00:02:43.560> they<00:02:43.920> are<00:02:43.950> doing<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.400> very

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
inside as well they are doing the very

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:45.619 
inside as well they are doing the very
best<00:02:44.610> that<00:02:44.849> they<00:02:45.090> can

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
best that they can

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:47.539 
best that they can
although<00:02:46.319> we<00:02:46.470> do<00:02:46.590> have<00:02:46.769> some<00:02:46.829> very<00:02:47.220> active

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
like this building is going to be a

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.960 
like this building is going to be a
total<00:02:52.049> loss<00:02:52.170> we<00:02:52.470> will<00:02:52.620> be<00:02:53.340> able<00:02:53.489> to<00:02:53.640> bring<00:02:53.849> you

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
total loss we will be able to bring you

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.630 
total loss we will be able to bring you
more<00:02:54.239> images<00:02:55.140> at<00:02:55.590> the<00:02:55.709> extent<00:02:56.069> of<00:02:56.099> the<00:02:56.190> damages

more images at the extent of the damages

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.520 
more images at the extent of the damages
they<00:02:56.819> like<00:02:57.000> but<00:02:57.540> for<00:02:57.870> now<00:02:57.989> it's<00:02:58.140> pretty<00:02:58.319> dark

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
they like but for now it's pretty dark

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.440 
they like but for now it's pretty dark

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
so hard to tell exactly how many
