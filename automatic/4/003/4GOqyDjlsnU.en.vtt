00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
this Mabus a Kenyan machinery there is a

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.770 
this Mabus a Kenyan machinery there is a
vacuum<00:01:34.079> pump<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.650> vacuum<00:01:35.159> out<00:01:35.630> excess<00:01:36.630> water

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
vacuum pump to vacuum out excess water

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.620 
vacuum pump to vacuum out excess water
and<00:01:37.259> then<00:01:38.130> there's<00:01:38.340> a<00:01:38.369> press<00:01:38.700> section<00:01:39.060> where

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
and then there's a press section where

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.510 
and then there's a press section where
you<00:01:39.750> squeeze<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.259> water<00:01:40.500> through<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.159> paper

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
you squeeze the water through the paper

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
you squeeze the water through the paper
into<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.909> felt<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:43.280> then<00:01:44.280> you<00:01:44.430> vacuum<00:01:45.030> the

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
into a felt and then you vacuum the

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.410 
into a felt and then you vacuum the
water<00:01:45.810> out<00:01:46.079> of<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.350> felt<00:01:46.710> so<00:01:47.549> every<00:01:47.880> time<00:01:48.090> it

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
water out of the felt so every time it

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.210 
water out of the felt so every time it
goes<00:01:48.540> around<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:49.140> can<00:01:49.290> put<00:01:49.470> more<00:01:49.619> water<00:01:49.920> into

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
goes around you can put more water into

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.969 
goes around you can put more water into
it<00:01:50.399> in<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.610> paper<00:01:50.820> making<00:01:51.090> process<00:01:51.710> as<00:01:52.710> the

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
it in the paper making process as the

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.070 
it in the paper making process as the
paper<00:01:53.189> is<00:01:53.430> made<00:01:53.610> of<00:01:53.880> strength<00:01:54.270> so

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
paper is made of strength so

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.240 
paper is made of strength so
gonna<00:01:55.260> have<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.440> go<00:01:55.620> a<00:01:55.650> little<00:01:55.860> different

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
gonna have to go a little different

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.850 
gonna have to go a little different
scheme<00:01:56.490> after<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.450> press<00:01:57.720> section<00:01:58.230> there's<00:01:58.770> a

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.520 
scheme after the press section there's a
drying<00:01:59.160> section<00:01:59.730> where<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.210> paper<00:02:00.750> is<00:02:00.900> heated

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
drying section where the paper is heated

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.190 
drying section where the paper is heated
up<00:02:01.650> and<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.040> water<00:02:02.250> will<00:02:02.580> evaporate<00:02:02.910> off<00:02:03.390> and

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
up and the water will evaporate off and

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.650 
up and the water will evaporate off and
it<00:02:04.500> gets<00:02:04.620> down<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:04.920> about<00:02:05.340> 95<00:02:05.910> percent<00:02:06.150> fiber

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660 
it gets down to about 95 percent fiber

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.260 
it gets down to about 95 percent fiber
and<00:02:06.960> 5%<00:02:07.530> water<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:08.670> then<00:02:08.760> it<00:02:08.850> goes<00:02:08.970> through<00:02:09.000> a

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
and 5% water and then it goes through a

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.870 
and 5% water and then it goes through a
set<00:02:10.200> of<00:02:10.229> challenger<00:02:10.740> rolls<00:02:10.950> pretty<00:02:11.220> floss<00:02:11.580> on

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
set of challenger rolls pretty floss on

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.810 
set of challenger rolls pretty floss on
the<00:02:11.940> paper<00:02:12.180> get<00:02:13.110> that<00:02:13.320> shiny<00:02:13.650> effect<00:02:13.830> so<00:02:14.760> you

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
the paper get that shiny effect so you

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.000 
the paper get that shiny effect so you
can<00:02:15.060> print<00:02:15.330> it<00:02:15.480> or<00:02:15.630> write<00:02:15.840> on<00:02:16.020> it<00:02:16.050> and<00:02:16.800> then<00:02:16.920> it

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
can print it or write on it and then it

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.850 
can print it or write on it and then it
winds<00:02:17.220> up<00:02:17.430> on<00:02:17.640> a<00:02:17.670> on<00:02:18.120> a<00:02:18.180> real<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:19.410> paper<00:02:19.620> we

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
winds up on a on a real the paper we

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.400 
winds up on a on a real the paper we
made<00:02:20.100> is<00:02:20.850> pretty<00:02:21.450> crude<00:02:21.720> but<00:02:21.930> we<00:02:22.080> could<00:02:22.260> make

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
made is pretty crude but we could make

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.500 
made is pretty crude but we could make
the<00:02:22.650> paper<00:02:23.010> on<00:02:23.220> this<00:02:23.340> machine<00:02:23.730> this<00:02:24.180> is<00:02:24.240> kind

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
the paper on this machine this is kind

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.140 
the paper on this machine this is kind
of<00:02:24.540> like<00:02:24.720> our<00:02:24.840> mascot
