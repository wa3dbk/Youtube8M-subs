00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.670
 good afternoon my name is Julia now i'm 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.690
 I suggest you make beads with polymer 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.950
 clay or otherwise called plastic 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:17.430
 boots will be about such 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:19.109
 but accordingly another color first 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.199
 prepare the work surface 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.250
 I pulled the cling film but best 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.170
 use glass 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.380
 because the surface should not be 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.520
 as smooth as possible 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:36.540
 next we need a stationery knife 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:38.760
 soft cloth and a toothpick then take 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.770
 plastic i use film plastic 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.399
 because she possesses in my opinion 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.559
 best possible properties neatly 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.800
 cut off 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:53.789
 the right amount now plastic need 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:57.270
 warm warmed plastics rolled down 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.579
 circle and leave after we 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.760
 We worked with the dark color should be 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.600
 rub your hands so as not to get dirty 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:10.280
 In this case, white now I will do 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.280
 of the resulting balls with cylinders 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:18.770
 I will now select the sequence 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.770
 drawings which still got me 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:27.980
 let's say not the first cylinder 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:31.230
 save the side from the rest do 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.280
 little blankets so that she can 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:36.900
 had to wrap 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:39.750
 wrap our top hat the same 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.150
 the next piece so we will 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.360
 wrap our cylinder layer by layer 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.460
 different colors of plastic if plastic 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.810
 sticks to your hands just again 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.810
 rub your fingers well 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:58.170
 well we wrapped our top hat 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.580
 all the layers that we wanted now 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.690
 ride him a little so they 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:05.910
 interconnected stronger for 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:09.300
 core fillings can be 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:13.380
 use any plastic I take the most 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.400
 I do not need to cut off the color now 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.430
 from our sausage 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.239
 thin circles thick 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.239
 millimeter and a half 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.040
 serve 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:32.840
 the desired diameter is slightly stretched and 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:34.470
 we lay the blanks on one side and 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:39.740
 then on the other 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.740
 and roll up so as not to see the joint 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:47.940
 such a bead we got our pattern to 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:52.080
 you can make in any way possible 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.550
 make longitudinal strips or a lot 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.920
 pollen or flower 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:59.280
 what we want now we need to do 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.410
 them hole to string on 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.420
 choose the most beautiful places and 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.060
 gently poke a toothpick 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.130
 while we worked on the bead remained 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.620
 fingerprints 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.860
 to make them smoother they need 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.530
 ride one again in the glove 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.970
 left them only for the stove 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:20.400
 Here and slaughter the flowers I have already 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:23.820
 baked beads as you see on them 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.739
 slightly different pattern to beads 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:29.670
 glittered they will need to varnish and 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:32.459
 Begin lay out beads in the same order as in 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.709
 coma nomads see the finished product I want 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:37.680
 so as not to diverge from the larger 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:40.550
 smaller beads does not burn at all 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:43.040
 at a temperature of one hundred and ten 120 degrees 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:45.780
 for 15 minutes or half an hour 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:49.680
 depending on the size of the beads are small 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:52.410
 can a woman for 10 15 big be better 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.640
 wait longer the main thing is not 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.780
 overdo and not do more 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.530
 temperature values 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:02.040
 burn brown will also not possible 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:05.010
 burn the beads and cook them, that is, throw them 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:07.520
 in boiling water also for 20 minutes on 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.520
 half an hour 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.010
 These are beads of us will 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:19.350
 combining different colors and different patterns 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.889
 can achieve completely different 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.889
 result
