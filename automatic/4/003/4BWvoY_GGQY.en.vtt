00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.000

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.929
 friends and we were no different 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.059
 the city of redwood city is in silicon 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:18.730
 valley and there is a place fly highway there 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:22.720

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:26.080
 network well and here's the dealer shift and on the left a 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:29.620
 here on the right we will have refueling now 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.810
 car so prehistoric here we are with 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:34.390
 you filmed contactless refueling 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:37.149

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.879
 let's go I will continue all this friends 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:42.100
 remote control is the proper meaning 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:44.620
 This is all about where I am 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.739
 keyboard dial a chick 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:50.160
 five digits that you give when you buy 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:51.930
 2 in the trash 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.700
 this can happen in the form of regrinding 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.059
 that you give during refueling 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:01:00.809
 gasoline suck there and you can just 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:04.860
 cards there really written sorry 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:07.260
 kartik do not take here you can even cash 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:11.340
 speak and there is yes for white there 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.760
 down here and here we are now 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.810
 Now go in this direction and the 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:19.440
 the sun is so falling that we are not very 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.150
 clearly seen here, but I was off for now 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.649
 conductive when it comes to the body in a minute 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.649
 let's go inside and I'll turn on 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:33.190
 the car in front of us moved ahead 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:36.000
 we will now go to us green light 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.000
 from the Tina tribe 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.320
 yeah 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:44.320
 see it there so little dry 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.630
 how much 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.630
 Everybody where the difference Gleb 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.720
 jose 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.720
 clearly green signal and 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.880
 some moment he will say reds 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:11.990
 will tell us no until this happens 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:15.400
 stop says stop everyone stopped 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.400
 may even be 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.360
 wash our friends totally 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:40.170
 prehistoric here before 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:44.100
 the appearance of contactless means the most 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:51.090
 dear I took for $ 9 there already and with 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:57.300
 triple shampoo and with max with wax there 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:59.210
 then it means so on to make it easier 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:04.450
 mud was washed off 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:04.450
 when her husband is there as janitors 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.870
 I must say that this one 

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:14.530
 waxing 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:16.900
 has its drawbacks because 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.490
 when the wipers wash the little ones 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.880
 water droplets remain 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:24.950
 that is, so here is some such 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:28.450
 smooth that your yard is not transported no 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.450
 don't take one hundred percent 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.310
 see what's going on in the cage 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:43.500
 this is what this washes 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:47.480
 something about went to find us straight went 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.480
 we have such a terrible thing 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:54.980
 from all sides of the gods 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.980
 here it is on the front 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.920
 went gone went 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:03.189
 on the hood as work work 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.019
 painting 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:17.019
 indicator 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.150
 without mother 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.380
 him 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.380
 carwash cars 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.730
 urgent issue is acute 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:44.290
 about saving water 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:44.290
 earlier they somehow watered everything 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:50.060
 and now they are trying to save my 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:55.000
 understanding is that these old sinks 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:55.000
 they are more costly 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:05:04.050
 so this cut with the key this 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:04.050
 air conditioner turned off 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:11.830
 oh listen to me janitors had to 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:11.830
 disable this is not on the machine 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:18.640
 how can I not for all 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:29.139
 I'm better than the engine in the budget 

00:05:27.249 --> 00:05:32.879
 how to learn how to turn off the wipers 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:32.879
 never had such a task 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:56.200
 go to water us something so I 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:56.200
 has spoken do not water irrigate 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.800
 here 

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:11.800
 sprinkled 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:17.680
 here is the inscription says rinsed 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:20.800
 there after all he is ahead of the operation describes 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.800
 clear coat 

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:25.980
 so different weather 

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:35.360
 lay out 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.360
 that 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.290
 now get out of here 

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:49.480
 let's ask him 

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:56.139
 sin 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.139
 we go go go 

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:59.740
 there will be a thing right now 

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:03.759
 us 

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.620
 tale of walking as we cut out 

00:07:15.569 --> 00:07:19.710
 Toropets we will not 

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.710
 there are no loaches 

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:23.889
 stayed as it is known 

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:49.680
 I leave we leave a reserved place
