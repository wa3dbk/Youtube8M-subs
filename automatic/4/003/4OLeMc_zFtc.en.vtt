a dreamlike experience through prints
and<00:01:27.410> then<00:01:28.100> I<00:01:28.190> like<00:01:28.340> to<00:01:28.370> mix<00:01:28.640> those<00:01:28.880> together

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
and so the inspiration really was about

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.490 
and so the inspiration really was about
something<00:01:32.120> that<00:01:32.390> was<00:01:32.540> quite<00:01:32.780> dreamlike<00:01:33.229> and

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
something that was quite dreamlike and

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.990 
something that was quite dreamlike and
how'd<00:01:33.650> you<00:01:33.680> take<00:01:33.920> that<00:01:34.130> and<00:01:34.460> make<00:01:34.610> it<00:01:34.640> reality

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
how'd you take that and make it reality

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.150 
how'd you take that and make it reality
so<00:01:35.720> that<00:01:35.900> while<00:01:36.140> you're<00:01:36.290> getting<00:01:36.410> dressed<00:01:36.590> you

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.160 
so that while you're getting dressed you

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.880 
so that while you're getting dressed you
