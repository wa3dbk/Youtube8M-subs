00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
their intestines each day and so a lot

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.300 
their intestines each day and so a lot
of<00:00:18.630> people<00:00:18.930> who<00:00:19.020> feel<00:00:19.260> like<00:00:19.470> they<00:00:19.650> have<00:00:19.860> a<00:00:20.130> lot

people who just swallow an abnormal
amount<00:01:04.590> of<00:01:04.830> air<00:01:05.070> so<00:01:05.700> maybe<00:01:06.090> think<00:01:06.390> about<00:01:06.600> this

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
amount of air so maybe think about this

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.160 
amount of air so maybe think about this
and<00:01:07.200> see<00:01:07.380> if<00:01:07.500> this<00:01:07.680> may<00:01:07.920> apply<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:09.020> but<00:01:10.020> as

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
and see if this may apply to you but as

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.440 
and see if this may apply to you but as
far<00:01:10.200> as<00:01:10.500> diet<00:01:10.770> changes<00:01:11.250> go<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:11.490> maybe<00:01:11.880> reduce

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
far as diet changes go to maybe reduce

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.050 
far as diet changes go to maybe reduce
this<00:01:12.720> dairy<00:01:13.290> like<00:01:13.770> I<00:01:13.920> said<00:01:14.160> can<00:01:14.550> actually

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
this dairy like I said can actually

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.130 
this dairy like I said can actually
contribute<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.690> if<00:01:15.780> you're<00:01:15.900> lactose

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
contribute to it if you're lactose

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.230 
contribute to it if you're lactose
intolerant<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.100> you<00:01:17.580> might<00:01:17.730> have<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:18.000> give<00:01:18.150> it

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
intolerant and you might have to give it

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.580 
intolerant and you might have to give it
more<00:01:18.360> than<00:01:18.420> just<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.720> few<00:01:18.870> days<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.260> see<00:01:19.290> if<00:01:19.440> it's

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
more than just a few days to see if it's

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.080 
more than just a few days to see if it's
gonna<00:01:19.740> make<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.950> difference<00:01:20.400> in<00:01:20.610> fact<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.970> give

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
gonna make a difference in fact to give

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.880 
gonna make a difference in fact to give
it<00:01:21.180> like<00:01:21.300> one<00:01:21.480> to<00:01:21.600> two<00:01:21.660> weeks<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.290> see<00:01:22.560> if<00:01:22.680> that

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
it like one to two weeks and see if that

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.830 
it like one to two weeks and see if that
helps<00:01:23.100> there<00:01:23.910> are<00:01:24.000> other<00:01:24.120> things<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.540> can

helps there are other things that can

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.590 
helps there are other things that can
cause<00:01:24.900> an<00:01:25.290> increase<00:01:25.620> in<00:01:25.650> gas<00:01:26.060> coming<00:01:27.060> back<00:01:27.360> up

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
cause an increase in gas coming back up

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.480 
cause an increase in gas coming back up
like<00:01:27.870> peppermint<00:01:28.260> and<00:01:28.440> chocolate<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:28.980> fatty

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
like peppermint and chocolate and fatty

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.060 
like peppermint and chocolate and fatty
foods<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:30.180> so<00:01:30.780> try<00:01:31.020> avoiding<00:01:31.320> those<00:01:31.560> two<00:01:31.890> and

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
foods and so try avoiding those two and

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.620 
foods and so try avoiding those two and
see<00:01:32.190> if<00:01:32.310> it<00:01:32.400> makes<00:01:32.550> a<00:01:32.700> difference<00:01:32.730> that's<00:01:33.420> kind

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
see if it makes a difference that's kind

try them one at a time to see which one
might<00:01:40.830> help<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:41.580> because<00:01:41.850> obviously<00:01:42.090> don't

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.000 
able to eat any of those foods there are
other<00:01:48.060> gas<00:01:48.390> producing<00:01:48.990> foods<00:01:49.290> that<00:01:49.620> you<00:01:49.890> know

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010 
other gas producing foods that you know

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:51.620 
other gas producing foods that you know
most<00:01:50.159> people<00:01:50.490> know<00:01:50.640> about<00:01:50.790> there's<00:01:51.390> an

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
most people know about there's an

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.570 
most people know about there's an
ingredient<00:01:52.170> called<00:01:52.380> Bravo<00:01:52.920> notes<00:01:53.130> that<00:01:53.340> send

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
ingredient called Bravo notes that send

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.280 
ingredient called Bravo notes that send
things<00:01:53.820> like<00:01:54.150> Brussels<00:01:54.630> sprouts<00:01:54.960> broccoli

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
things like Brussels sprouts broccoli

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.600 
things like Brussels sprouts broccoli
asparagus<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.700> legumes<00:01:57.090> beans<00:01:57.960> that<00:01:58.610> it

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
asparagus and legumes beans that it

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.840 
asparagus and legumes beans that it
causes<00:02:00.600> an<00:02:01.290> excess<00:02:01.409> of<00:02:01.740> gas<00:02:01.950> because<00:02:02.490> it's<00:02:02.670> not

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
causes an excess of gas because it's not

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.610 
causes an excess of gas because it's not
digested<00:02:03.420> well<00:02:03.570> in<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.840> colon<00:02:04.200> and<00:02:04.409> so

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:04.620 
digested well in the colon and so

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.190 
digested well in the colon and so
bacteria<00:02:05.100> end<00:02:05.430> up<00:02:05.610> digesting<00:02:06.210> it<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:06.570> this

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
bacteria end up digesting it and this

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.859 
bacteria end up digesting it and this
produces<00:02:07.770> more<00:02:08.009> gas<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.280> so<00:02:08.819> you<00:02:09.389> can<00:02:09.599> avoid

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
produces more gas and so you can avoid

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.420 
produces more gas and so you can avoid
those<00:02:10.109> types<00:02:10.439> of<00:02:10.590> things<00:02:10.829> to<00:02:11.009> see<00:02:11.189> if<00:02:11.280> that

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
those types of things to see if that

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.610 
those types of things to see if that
helps<00:02:11.639> as<00:02:11.909> well<00:02:12.150> if<00:02:12.480> these<00:02:12.870> basic<00:02:13.319> two

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
helps as well if these basic two

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.800 
helps as well if these basic two
and<00:02:13.769> tricks<00:02:14.040> aren't<00:02:14.489> helping<00:02:14.940> then<00:02:15.360> ask<00:02:15.569> your
