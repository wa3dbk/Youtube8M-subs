00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.640
 From flying saucers to ghosts and supernatural powers, history is filled with unexplained things that you can 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:12.640
 Come back now, or know things that you do not want to know. These are the facts: 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:25.260
 In 1839, Robert Anderson invented the first electric powered car and since then scientists have tried 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.210
 To modify the car more to improve it, hoping that someday the electric cars will 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.829
 Is working to end the world from addiction to "burning energy". But this technique is still in its infancy. 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:40.589
 Its best batteries are still heavy in size and take a long time to recharge. 

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:45.459
 The distance traveled is still small, and for the average person it is considered expensive. 

00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:49.549
 And that some of the best scientists in the world are working to solve the problem 

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:55.799
 However, it will take the average person to get a car for a few years 

00:00:55.799 --> 00:01:00.209
 However, some theoreticians do not agree with these reasons, and many people believe that the technology required for the success of the "electric car" 

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:04.559
 Already exist, and that other companies are trying to delay them from appearing 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.420
 Using their influence to keep cars out of the market. Why? 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.399
 Get ready for the shocking news: This is not the first time that companies have been accused of trying to abort an electric vehicle 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:21.479
 In 1974, "Bradford Snell" of the US Senate of the Anti-Monopoly Branch claimed that: 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.479
 General Motors has tried to kill the "electric trains" project in 45 cities around the United States 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.840
 Snell claims that General Motors was buying "electric train manufacturers" to dismantle and isolate them 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:39.159
 To force cities and individuals to use buses manufactured by General Motors. In the end, the company escaped the charge of monopoly 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.990
 But the company's reputation is no longer the same. And in several decades "of years" 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.049
 So far there is no electric car at an affordable price, according to analysts such as 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.219
 "Doug Kurtoff," the car manufacturers were dragging her feet slowly and deliberately over the past decades "of years" 

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:57.679
 In the film "Who Killed the Electric Car" "Who Killed the Electric Car" director Chris Pine claims that 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:03.850
 GM deliberately hid the "saturn EV1" despite its high demand for "the car" 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.799
 Representatives of General Motors claimed that the electric "saturn EV1" did not have a high demand in the market 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:13.209
 And it is difficult to continue to make them. On the other hand, it seems possible. 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.180
 The car company has to bring money to ensure its survival is successful. But on the other hand it looks like it was 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.110
 bad idea . If a company develops an excellent electric car, it can control the market and bring in billions of profits 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.459
 So why are companies trying to kill the electric car project? 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:31.370
 Some skeptics believe the answer to this question is in the halls of major oil companies 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.790
 In the end, these companies rely entirely on cars that use fuel and a large proportion of the company's income 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.670
 Skeptics believe that: oil companies cooperated closely with car companies 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.180
 To buy the rights of any excellent batteries and hide them from the market 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.200
 This possibility seems closer but, far from being the final answer. Car manufacturers and [consumer protection groups] 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.680
 They can not agree if the consumer wants electric cars, but there are facts that can not be questioned 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.950
 The current electric cars are more expensive than fuel-powered vehicles 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.230
 For some it may seem that scientists have not yet resolved 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.170
 But for some it may seem that car and oil companies have hidden the technology 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.569
 Is this really possible? 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:24.079
 That global oil-producing companies unite with auto manufacturers to make quick gains while ignoring the damage caused by long-term pollution? 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:29.709
 Are there evidence in their labs and archives that they do not want you to know?
