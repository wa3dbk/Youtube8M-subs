that's<00:01:51.710> a<00:01:51.920> good<00:01:52.070> because<00:01:52.549> if<00:01:52.700> the<00:01:52.850> roots<00:01:53.210> are

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:53.359 
that's a good because if the roots are

that's a good because if the roots are
going<00:01:53.539> around<00:01:53.929> it<00:01:54.710> gives<00:01:55.130> them<00:01:55.399> that<00:01:55.850> extra

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
going around it gives them that extra

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.690 
going around it gives them that extra
encouragement<00:01:56.450> to<00:01:57.259> be<00:01:57.439> looking<00:01:58.100> outward<00:01:58.490> and
