only 256 Meg's of RAM now please don't
confuse<00:01:21.170> that<00:01:21.530> with<00:01:21.590> the<00:01:21.890> amount<00:01:22.070> of<00:01:22.130> storage

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
confuse that with the amount of storage

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.660 
confuse that with the amount of storage
for<00:01:22.850> example<00:01:23.270> the<00:01:23.630> iPad<00:01:24.050> was<00:01:24.260> sold<00:01:24.500> with<00:01:24.740> 16<00:01:25.159> 32

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
for example the iPad was sold with 16 32

for example the iPad was sold with 16 32

or 64 gigabytes of flash memory but

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.219 
or 64 gigabytes of flash memory but
don't<00:01:28.520> be<00:01:28.610> confused<00:01:28.909> this<00:01:29.180> is<00:01:29.240> not<00:01:29.390> RAM<00:01:29.870> and

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
don't be confused this is not RAM and

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:32.560 
don't be confused this is not RAM and
cannot<00:01:30.500> be<00:01:30.650> used<00:01:30.680> as<00:01:31.010> such<00:01:31.420> just<00:01:32.420> as<00:01:32.540> a

cannot be used as such just as a

comparison<00:01:33.170> the<00:01:33.290> iPad<00:01:33.620> 2<00:01:33.830> comes<00:01:34.130> with<00:01:34.220> 512

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
comparison the iPad 2 comes with 512

megabytes<00:01:34.880> in<00:01:35.479> the<00:01:35.570> iPad<00:01:35.900> 3<00:01:36.260> has<00:01:36.500> 1<00:01:36.800> gigabyte

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
megabytes in the iPad 3 has 1 gigabyte

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.230 
megabytes in the iPad 3 has 1 gigabyte
so<00:01:39.710> I'm<00:01:39.920> going<00:01:40.159> to<00:01:40.250> say<00:01:40.370> that<00:01:40.549> web<00:01:40.700> browsing<00:01:40.970> is

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
so I'm going to say that web browsing is

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.020 
so I'm going to say that web browsing is
crippled<00:01:41.630> as<00:01:41.810> it<00:01:41.960> is<00:01:42.080> and<00:01:42.490> this<00:01:43.490> is<00:01:43.549> only<00:01:43.820> going

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
crippled as it is and this is only going

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.980 
crippled as it is and this is only going
to<00:01:44.150> get<00:01:44.330> worse<00:01:44.570> as<00:01:44.870> the<00:01:45.140> years<00:01:45.350> pass<00:01:45.620> by<00:01:46.990> email

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
to get worse as the years pass by email

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.360 
to get worse as the years pass by email
still<00:01:48.229> works<00:01:48.440> just<00:01:48.710> fine<00:01:48.860> on<00:01:48.920> the<00:01:49.190> first

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:49.370 
still works just fine on the first

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:50.560 
still works just fine on the first
generation<00:01:49.490> and<00:01:49.909> there<00:01:50.060> are<00:01:50.120> only<00:01:50.240> minor

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
generation and there are only minor

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.810 
generation and there are only minor
improvements<00:01:51.260> on<00:01:51.350> the<00:01:51.440> later<00:01:51.620> versions<00:01:52.070> along

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
improvements on the later versions along

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:53.649 
improvements on the later versions along
that<00:01:53.000> same<00:01:53.240> line

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659

iMessage<00:01:54.080> also<00:01:54.590> works<00:01:54.770> just<00:01:55.010> fine<00:01:56.440> so<00:01:57.440> I'll

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
iMessage also works just fine so I'll

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.280 
iMessage also works just fine so I'll

accessories<00:04:11.110> such<00:04:11.290> as<00:04:11.320> protective<00:04:11.950> cases<00:04:12.340> so

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
accessories such as protective cases so

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.310 
accessories such as protective cases so
I'll<00:04:13.300> give<00:04:13.540> it<00:04:13.600> a<00:04:13.660> passing<00:04:14.050> grade<00:04:14.290> on

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:14.320 
I'll give it a passing grade on

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.789 
I'll give it a passing grade on
connectivity<00:04:15.900> so<00:04:16.900> I<00:04:17.080> hope<00:04:17.260> this<00:04:17.380> gives<00:04:17.560> you<00:04:17.709> an

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
connectivity so I hope this gives you an

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.160 
connectivity so I hope this gives you an
idea<00:04:17.920> of<00:04:18.130> where<00:04:18.340> the<00:04:18.370> iPad<00:04:18.850> 1<00:04:19.060> stands<00:04:19.600> some

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.170 
idea of where the iPad 1 stands some

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.290 
idea of where the iPad 1 stands some
people<00:04:20.440> might<00:04:20.620> ask<00:04:20.650> is<00:04:21.430> it<00:04:21.640> possible<00:04:21.670> to

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
people might ask is it possible to

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.170 
people might ask is it possible to
upgrade<00:04:22.450> the<00:04:22.750> RAM<00:04:22.930> to<00:04:23.200> make<00:04:23.320> it<00:04:23.440> faster

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
upgrade the RAM to make it faster

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.700 
upgrade the RAM to make it faster
unfortunately<00:04:25.180> no<00:04:25.480> the<00:04:25.810> RAM<00:04:26.020> is<00:04:26.230> actually

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
unfortunately no the RAM is actually

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.070 
unfortunately no the RAM is actually
stored<00:04:27.010> completely<00:04:27.700> inside<00:04:28.240> of<00:04:28.540> the<00:04:28.600> a4<00:04:29.050> chip

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
stored completely inside of the a4 chip

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.560 
stored completely inside of the a4 chip
and<00:04:29.620> cannot<00:04:29.980> be<00:04:30.220> upgraded<00:04:30.370> it<00:04:31.270> may<00:04:31.510> be

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
and cannot be upgraded it may be

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.270 
and cannot be upgraded it may be
possible<00:04:32.050> to<00:04:32.110> upgrade<00:04:32.440> the<00:04:32.560> flash<00:04:32.830> storage

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
possible to upgrade the flash storage

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.620 
possible to upgrade the flash storage
and<00:04:33.430> I<00:04:33.490> think<00:04:33.700> some<00:04:33.910> people<00:04:34.030> have<00:04:34.210> done<00:04:34.450> that

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
and I think some people have done that

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:37.470 
and I think some people have done that
but<00:04:35.200> the<00:04:35.350> RAM<00:04:35.560> is<00:04:35.800> out<00:04:36.130> of<00:04:36.160> the<00:04:36.370> question<00:04:36.490> ok<00:04:37.450> so

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480 
but the RAM is out of the question ok so

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.840 
but the RAM is out of the question ok so
you<00:04:37.720> see<00:04:37.990> that<00:04:38.140> I've<00:04:38.260> given<00:04:38.440> the<00:04:38.650> iPad<00:04:39.010> 1<00:04:39.220> for

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
you see that I've given the iPad 1 for

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.630 
you see that I've given the iPad 1 for
the<00:04:39.940> most<00:04:40.180> part<00:04:40.419> of<00:04:40.570> passing<00:04:41.020> grade<00:04:41.260> it's<00:04:42.160> you

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
the most part of passing grade it's you

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.310 
the most part of passing grade it's you
know<00:04:42.760> it's<00:04:42.970> got<00:04:43.270> a<00:04:43.300> few<00:04:43.540> issues<00:04:43.660> web<00:04:44.050> browsing

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 
know it's got a few issues web browsing

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.250 
know it's got a few issues web browsing
is<00:04:44.620> a<00:04:44.650> big<00:04:44.890> one<00:04:45.040> and<00:04:46.030> you<00:04:46.510> know<00:04:46.660> no<00:04:46.900> vit<00:04:47.110> no

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260 
is a big one and you know no vit no

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.400 
is a big one and you know no vit no
camera<00:04:47.740> of<00:04:47.890> any<00:04:48.130> kind<00:04:48.490> is<00:04:48.850> another<00:04:49.360> problem<00:04:49.750> so

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:50.410 
camera of any kind is another problem so

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.020 
camera of any kind is another problem so
it's<00:04:50.560> important<00:04:50.890> to<00:04:50.950> point<00:04:51.130> out<00:04:51.310> that<00:04:51.610> despite

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
it's important to point out that despite

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.420 
it's important to point out that despite
its<00:04:52.450> shortcomings<00:04:52.840> the<00:04:53.470> iPad<00:04:53.890> 1<00:04:54.130> can<00:04:54.400> be

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
its shortcomings the iPad 1 can be

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.580 
its shortcomings the iPad 1 can be
purchased<00:04:54.910> for<00:04:55.060> around<00:04:55.419> a<00:04:55.570> hundred<00:04:55.840> bucks<00:04:56.290> on

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
purchased for around a hundred bucks on

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.890 
purchased for around a hundred bucks on
the<00:04:56.710> used<00:04:56.950> market<00:04:57.070> I<00:04:57.550> imagine<00:04:58.390> as<00:04:58.510> time<00:04:58.690> goes

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900 
the used market I imagine as time goes

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.620 
the used market I imagine as time goes
by<00:04:58.930> that<00:04:59.140> price<00:04:59.560> will<00:04:59.770> get<00:04:59.919> even<00:05:00.250> lower<00:05:00.580> so<00:05:01.270> um

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
by that price will get even lower so um

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:05.159 
by that price will get even lower so um
that<00:05:02.620> is<00:05:02.650> worth<00:05:03.100> considering<00:05:03.880> if<00:05:04.090> it<00:05:04.510> lives<00:05:04.900> up

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:05.169 
that is worth considering if it lives up

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:06.870 
that is worth considering if it lives up
to<00:05:05.200> all<00:05:05.530> the<00:05:05.650> things<00:05:05.830> that<00:05:06.130> you<00:05:06.220> need<00:05:06.430> a<00:05:06.460> tablet

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 
to all the things that you need a tablet

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.180 
to all the things that you need a tablet
to<00:05:07.000> do
