00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
I'm going to be alternating between the

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.679 
I'm going to be alternating between the
four<00:01:19.979> colors<00:01:20.310> for<00:01:20.490> each<00:01:20.579> section<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:21.299> get<00:01:21.420> a

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
four colors for each section to get a

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.569 
four colors for each section to get a
multicolored<00:01:22.409> look<00:01:22.590> so<00:01:23.040> I<00:01:23.070> took<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.369> bit<00:01:23.549> of

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:23.579 
multicolored look so I took a bit of

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:25.249 
multicolored look so I took a bit of
tinfoil<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.180> then<00:01:24.390> painted<00:01:24.750> on<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.049> first

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
tinfoil and then painted on the first

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.990 
tinfoil and then painted on the first
color<00:01:25.469> of<00:01:25.619> dye<00:01:25.770> using<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.369> dye<00:01:26.549> brush<00:01:26.820> from

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
color of dye using a dye brush from

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.359 
color of dye using a dye brush from
boots<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.719> then<00:01:28.320> I<00:01:28.530> just<00:01:28.710> decided<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.130> use<00:01:29.250> my

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
boots and then I just decided to use my

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.310 
boots and then I just decided to use my
fingers<00:01:29.670> in<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:29.850> said<00:01:30.090> I<00:01:30.329> sort<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:30.840> smushed<00:01:31.170> it

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
fingers in the said I sort of smushed it

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.990 
fingers in the said I sort of smushed it
around<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.710> bit<00:01:31.860> at<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.100> top<00:01:32.280> red<00:01:32.549> put<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:32.820> dye

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
around a bit at the top red put the dye

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.639 
around a bit at the top red put the dye
so<00:01:33.360> that<00:01:33.540> it<00:01:33.659> wouldn't<00:01:33.869> get<00:01:33.990> like<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.380> harsh

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:34.649 
so that it wouldn't get like a harsh

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:36.319 
so that it wouldn't get like a harsh
line<00:01:34.979> of<00:01:35.159> color<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.610> would<00:01:35.729> have<00:01:35.820> more<00:01:36.090> of<00:01:36.240> an

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
line of color and would have more of an

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.899 
line of color and would have more of an
ombre<00:01:36.659> effect<00:01:36.860> then<00:01:37.860> wrap<00:01:38.100> that<00:01:38.280> strand<00:01:38.520> up<00:01:38.729> in

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
ombre effect then wrap that strand up in

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.539 
ombre effect then wrap that strand up in
tinfoil<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:39.539> move<00:01:39.750> on<00:01:39.869> through<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.140> next<00:01:40.350> one

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
tinfoil and move on through the next one

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:42.740 
tinfoil and move on through the next one
the<00:01:41.549> reason<00:01:41.820> I<00:01:41.939> decided<00:01:42.210> not<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.479> use<00:01:42.630> the

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
the reason I decided not to use the

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.480 
the reason I decided not to use the
brush<00:01:42.990> was<00:01:43.259> because<00:01:43.619> with<00:01:43.770> four<00:01:43.979> colors<00:01:44.130> I<00:01:44.369> was

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
brush was because with four colors I was

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.529 
brush was because with four colors I was
gonna<00:01:44.579> have<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.820> wash<00:01:44.969> it<00:01:45.000> every<00:01:45.149> time<00:01:45.479> and

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:45.539 
gonna have to wash it every time and

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:47.810 
gonna have to wash it every time and
that<00:01:45.930> was<00:01:46.289> taking<00:01:46.799> a<00:01:46.890> long<00:01:47.009> time<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.670> I<00:01:47.700> was

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
that was taking a long time and I was

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.100 
that was taking a long time and I was
able<00:01:47.939> to<00:01:48.090> work<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.390> into<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:48.630> strands<00:01:49.049> just

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
able to work it into the strands just

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.230 
able to work it into the strands just
fine<00:01:49.439> with<00:01:49.590> my<00:01:49.740> fingers<00:01:50.130> what<00:01:50.850> I<00:01:50.880> did<00:01:51.090> do

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
fine with my fingers what I did do

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.819 
fine with my fingers what I did do
though<00:01:51.390> is<00:01:51.600> change<00:01:51.899> gloves<00:01:52.200> so<00:01:52.409> I<00:01:52.439> used<00:01:52.680> a

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
though is change gloves so I used a

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.289 
though is change gloves so I used a
different<00:01:52.979> pair<00:01:53.340> for<00:01:53.609> the<00:01:53.729> purple<00:01:54.060> the

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
different pair for the purple the

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.090 
different pair for the purple the
turquoise<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:54.990> then<00:01:55.200> one<00:01:55.409> for<00:01:55.590> both<00:01:55.740> things

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
turquoise and then one for both things

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.920 
turquoise and then one for both things
just<00:01:56.430> so<00:01:56.609> I<00:01:56.640> didn't<00:01:57.299> mix<00:01:57.450> the<00:01:57.570> colors<00:01:57.810> together

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
just so I didn't mix the colors together

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.450 
just so I didn't mix the colors together
too<00:01:58.289> much<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.710> get<00:01:58.799> some<00:01:58.979> sort<00:01:59.159> of<00:01:59.189> weird

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
too much and get some sort of weird

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.749 
too much and get some sort of weird
mucky<00:01:59.909> brown<00:02:00.689> color<00:02:01.079> then<00:02:01.350> I<00:02:02.340> just<00:02:02.520> repeated

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
mucky brown color then I just repeated

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.370 
mucky brown color then I just repeated
that<00:02:02.880> process<00:02:03.000> for<00:02:03.600> all<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.869> rest<00:02:04.049> of<00:02:04.200> my<00:02:04.350> hair

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
that process for all the rest of my hair

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.230 
that process for all the rest of my hair
making<00:02:04.859> sure<00:02:05.009> I<00:02:05.039> didn't<00:02:05.310> get<00:02:05.429> to<00:02:05.670> colors<00:02:06.000> too

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
making sure I didn't get to colors too

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.849 
making sure I didn't get to colors too
close<00:02:06.450> together<00:02:06.659> so<00:02:06.929> that<00:02:07.229> they're<00:02:07.350> all<00:02:07.500> mixed

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:07.859 
close together so that they're all mixed

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:09.950 
close together so that they're all mixed
up<00:02:07.979> and<00:02:08.190> getting<00:02:09.090> that<00:02:09.179> multicolored<00:02:09.780> look

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
up and getting that multicolored look

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.660 
up and getting that multicolored look
the<00:02:10.350> good<00:02:10.470> thing<00:02:10.679> is<00:02:10.800> you<00:02:10.950> can<00:02:11.130> kind<00:02:11.340> of<00:02:11.430> tell

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
the good thing is you can kind of tell

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.790 
the good thing is you can kind of tell
what<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.120> color<00:02:12.330> is<00:02:12.570> like<00:02:12.600> beneath<00:02:13.560> the

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
what the color is like beneath the

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.080 
what the color is like beneath the
Strand<00:02:14.070> that<00:02:14.220> you're<00:02:14.310> dying<00:02:14.490> because<00:02:14.970> the

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
Strand that you're dying because the

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.760 
Strand that you're dying because the
tinfoil<00:02:15.300> has<00:02:15.660> some<00:02:15.900> residue<00:02:16.290> on<00:02:16.410> it<00:02:16.440> things

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
tinfoil has some residue on it things

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:17.130 
tinfoil has some residue on it things
too

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
too

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.750 
too
we<00:02:17.320> had<00:02:17.470> finger-painting<00:02:18.100> style<00:02:18.400> of<00:02:18.580> hair

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
we had finger-painting style of hair

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.820 
we had finger-painting style of hair
dyeing<00:02:19.000> all<00:02:19.660> up<00:02:19.840> I<00:02:19.960> think<00:02:20.200> the<00:02:20.290> stone<00:02:20.530> part

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
dyeing all up I think the stone part

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.380 
dyeing all up I think the stone part
took<00:02:20.980> me<00:02:21.160> around<00:02:21.520> an<00:02:21.670> hour<00:02:21.790> because<00:02:22.090> I<00:02:22.270> was

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
took me around an hour because I was

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.420 
took me around an hour because I was
doing<00:02:22.630> such<00:02:22.810> small<00:02:23.080> strands<00:02:23.440> as<00:02:23.950> you<00:02:24.130> can<00:02:24.250> see

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
doing such small strands as you can see

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:25.980 
doing such small strands as you can see
even<00:02:24.730> though<00:02:24.940> I<00:02:24.970> used<00:02:25.240> gloves<00:02:25.480> I<00:02:25.690> still

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
even though I used gloves I still

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:27.690 
even though I used gloves I still
managed<00:02:26.260> to<00:02:26.350> get<00:02:26.440> some<00:02:26.590> dye<00:02:26.800> on<00:02:26.950> my<00:02:27.070> hands<00:02:27.460> but

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
managed to get some dye on my hands but

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.730 
managed to get some dye on my hands but
it<00:02:28.060> did<00:02:28.330> come<00:02:28.480> off<00:02:28.540> pretty<00:02:28.750> easily<00:02:28.990> next<00:02:29.500> I

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
it did come off pretty easily next I

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.350 
it did come off pretty easily next I
took<00:02:29.800> my<00:02:30.010> hair<00:02:30.190> dryer<00:02:30.430> and<00:02:30.760> blasted<00:02:31.270> the

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
took my hair dryer and blasted the

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.000 
took my hair dryer and blasted the
tinfoil<00:02:31.720> for<00:02:31.990> a<00:02:32.020> bit<00:02:32.170> because<00:02:32.350> I<00:02:32.620> dread<00:02:32.800> that

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
tinfoil for a bit because I dread that

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.560 
tinfoil for a bit because I dread that
heat<00:02:33.220> really<00:02:33.400> helps<00:02:33.700> the<00:02:33.790> dye<00:02:33.940> develop<00:02:34.390> and

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:34.570 
heat really helps the dye develop and

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.690 
heat really helps the dye develop and
it's<00:02:35.050> also<00:02:35.200> good<00:02:35.500> to<00:02:35.590> let<00:02:35.740> the<00:02:35.830> dye<00:02:35.980> dry<00:02:36.370> on<00:02:36.610> the

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
it's also good to let the dye dry on the

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.310 
it's also good to let the dye dry on the
hair<00:02:36.850> as<00:02:37.000> much<00:02:37.240> as<00:02:37.390> possible<00:02:37.540> before<00:02:37.930> you<00:02:38.140> wash

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
hair as much as possible before you wash

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.450 
hair as much as possible before you wash
it<00:02:38.440> off<00:02:38.530> so<00:02:38.920> then<00:02:39.070> I<00:02:39.130> just<00:02:39.160> hung<00:02:39.430> around

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.460 
it off so then I just hung around

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.280 
it off so then I just hung around
looking<00:02:40.000> like<00:02:40.030> an<00:02:40.300> idiot<00:02:40.390> for<00:02:40.810> about<00:02:41.020> two<00:02:41.230> and

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
looking like an idiot for about two and

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.870 
looking like an idiot for about two and
a<00:02:41.350> half<00:02:41.410> hours<00:02:41.800> before<00:02:41.950> taking<00:02:42.340> it<00:02:42.550> in<00:02:42.700> foil

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
a half hours before taking it in foil

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.670 
a half hours before taking it in foil
off<00:02:43.120> blow-drying<00:02:43.960> means<00:02:44.170> a<00:02:44.350> little<00:02:44.440> bit<00:02:44.560> more

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
off blow-drying means a little bit more

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.320 
off blow-drying means a little bit more
and<00:02:45.100> then<00:02:45.310> washing<00:02:45.550> out<00:02:45.760> the<00:02:45.880> dye<00:02:46.000> using

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
and then washing out the dye using

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:47.940 
and then washing out the dye using
conditioner<00:02:46.960> on<00:02:47.080> the<00:02:47.110> ends<00:02:47.440> to<00:02:47.590> seal<00:02:47.770> the

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
conditioner on the ends to seal the

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.140 
conditioner on the ends to seal the
color<00:02:48.130> when<00:02:48.370> the<00:02:48.490> dye<00:02:48.610> was<00:02:48.760> washed<00:02:48.940> out<00:02:49.090> I

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
color when the dye was washed out I

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.640 
color when the dye was washed out I
styled<00:02:49.660> my<00:02:49.750> hair<00:02:49.780> the<00:02:49.960> way<00:02:50.050> I<00:02:50.080> normally<00:02:50.320> do
