00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.130 
find it so here's the solution I came up
with<00:00:30.439> okay<00:00:31.439> I<00:00:31.679> have<00:00:32.279> a<00:00:32.309> glass<00:00:32.640> here<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.110> what<00:00:34.110> I

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
with okay I have a glass here and what I

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.729 
with okay I have a glass here and what I
have<00:00:34.380> is<00:00:34.620> a<00:00:34.649> Sierra<00:00:35.040> Nevada<00:00:35.370> Pale<00:00:35.610> Ale<00:00:36.469> this<00:00:37.469> is

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739

have is a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale this is
about<00:00:38.390> C<00:00:39.390> I<00:00:39.420> think<00:00:39.510> it's<00:00:39.780> five<00:00:40.050> point<00:00:40.590> for

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
about C I think it's five point for

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.510 
about C I think it's five point for
alcohol<00:00:42.570> five<00:00:43.290> points<00:00:43.620> five<00:00:43.920> point<00:00:44.129> six<00:00:44.280> out

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
alcohol five points five point six out

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.260 
alcohol five points five point six out

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.230 
kind of a good compromise you can go in
the<00:01:48.270> middle<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:49.520> enjoy<00:01:50.520> your<00:01:50.700> beer<00:01:50.880> but

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
the middle and and enjoy your beer but

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.060 
the middle and and enjoy your beer but
also<00:01:51.390> kind<00:01:51.960> of<00:01:52.020> cut<00:01:52.229> down<00:01:52.380> on<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.590> alcohol<00:01:52.890> and

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
also kind of cut down on the alcohol and

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.889 
also kind of cut down on the alcohol and
get<00:01:53.159> some<00:01:53.310> decent<00:01:53.430> flavor<00:01:53.759> out<00:01:54.030> of<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.210> so<00:01:54.720> if

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
get some decent flavor out of it so if

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.560 
get some decent flavor out of it so if
you're<00:01:55.049> saying<00:01:55.320> this<00:01:55.500> would<00:01:55.710> be<00:01:55.890> about<00:01:56.579> a<00:01:56.790> 5.6

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
you're saying this would be about a 5.6

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.660 
you're saying this would be about a 5.6
percent<00:01:57.750> alcohol<00:01:58.229> by<00:01:58.469> volume<00:01:58.649> you<00:01:59.549> would

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
percent alcohol by volume you would

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.010 
percent alcohol by volume you would
split<00:01:59.939> that<00:01:59.969> in<00:02:00.180> half<00:02:00.240> if<00:02:00.570> you<00:02:00.659> didn't<00:02:00.899> have

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
split that in half if you didn't have

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.959 
split that in half if you didn't have
that<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.619> it<00:02:01.770> would<00:02:01.890> be<00:02:02.040> half<00:02:02.850> of<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.090> 5.6<00:02:03.810> so

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:04.969 
that and it would be half of the 5.6 so

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:08.479 
that and it would be half of the 5.6 so
that's<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.869> latest<00:02:07.220> so-called<00:02:08.220> thing<00:02:08.369> I've

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489
