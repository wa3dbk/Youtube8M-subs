00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
extreme hole and I have deodorant this

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:43.640 
extreme hole and I have deodorant this
is<00:02:37.160> glam<00:02:38.160> up<00:02:40.070> so<00:02:41.070> that<00:02:41.880> everything<00:02:42.350> that's<00:02:43.350> in

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
is glam up so that everything that's in

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:53.570 
is glam up so that everything that's in
the<00:02:43.890> box<00:02:49.340> the<00:02:50.340> sprays<00:02:51.090> I<00:02:51.570> think<00:02:52.350> I<00:02:52.709> mean<00:02:53.400> this

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
the box the sprays I think I mean this

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:59.240 
the box the sprays I think I mean this
is<00:02:53.640> not<00:02:53.970> really<00:02:54.209> a<00:02:54.360> spray<00:02:54.720> right<00:02:57.320> but<00:02:58.320> and<00:02:58.709> this

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
is not really a spray right but and this

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.699 
is not really a spray right but and this
is<00:02:59.310> like<00:02:59.730> either<00:03:00.030> spray<00:03:00.480> but<00:03:00.720> is<00:03:00.870> small<00:03:01.350> so<00:03:01.680> I

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
is like either spray but is small so I

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.620 
is like either spray but is small so I
don't<00:03:02.040> think<00:03:02.250> that<00:03:02.340> would<00:03:02.790> be<00:03:02.940> a<00:03:02.970> problem<00:03:03.270> but

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
don't think that would be a problem but

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.680 
don't think that would be a problem but
maybe<00:03:03.900> the<00:03:04.230> deodorant<00:03:04.590> will<00:03:05.070> so<00:03:06.000> I<00:03:06.300> don't<00:03:06.600> know

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
maybe the deodorant will so I don't know

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.020 
maybe the deodorant will so I don't know
about<00:03:06.810> that<00:03:06.930> it<00:03:07.530> depends<00:03:08.130> where<00:03:08.700> you<00:03:08.820> come

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
about that it depends where you come

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.680 
about that it depends where you come
from<00:03:09.060> you<00:03:09.750> know<00:03:09.900> what<00:03:10.200> I<00:03:10.230> can<00:03:11.060> tip<00:03:12.060> and<00:03:12.300> what<00:03:12.540> I

from you know what I can tip and what I

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.240 
from you know what I can tip and what I
can<00:03:13.140> and<00:03:14.750> so<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:15.900> rules<00:03:16.170> are<00:03:16.470> of<00:03:16.739> course<00:03:17.040> you

you're<00:03:27.870> from<00:03:27.930> and<00:03:28.489> so<00:03:29.489> I<00:03:29.519> can<00:03:30.290> check<00:03:31.290> check<00:03:31.890> it

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
you're from and so I can check check it

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.930 
you're from and so I can check check it
out<00:03:32.250> where<00:03:33.650> you<00:03:34.650> know<00:03:34.800> what<00:03:35.130> I<00:03:35.160> comes<00:03:35.459> in<00:03:35.670> and<00:03:35.850> I

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
out where you know what I comes in and I

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.670 
out where you know what I comes in and I
cannot<00:03:36.300> sin<00:03:36.570> but<00:03:37.290> I<00:03:37.440> think<00:03:39.320> the<00:03:40.320> only<00:03:40.350> thing

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
cannot sin but I think the only thing

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.000 
cannot sin but I think the only thing
I'm<00:03:41.040> just<00:03:41.840> you<00:03:42.840> know<00:03:42.870> the<00:03:43.200> nail<00:03:43.380> polishes<00:03:43.860> are

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
I'm just you know the nail polishes are

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:45.890 
I'm just you know the nail polishes are
small<00:03:44.430> so<00:03:44.820> I<00:03:44.850> don't<00:03:45.150> think<00:03:45.390> that<00:03:45.600> would<00:03:45.720> be<00:03:45.870> a

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
small so I don't think that would be a

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:51.530 
small so I don't think that would be a
problem<00:03:46.200> but<00:03:46.650> maybe<00:03:47.430> these<00:03:47.610> will<00:03:47.670> so<00:03:49.310> but<00:03:50.310> so<00:03:51.239> I

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
problem but maybe these will so but so I

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.650 
problem but maybe these will so but so I
wish<00:03:52.019> you<00:03:52.049> luck<00:03:52.440> and<00:03:52.769> of<00:03:53.730> course<00:03:54.000> if<00:03:54.239> you<00:03:54.510> are
