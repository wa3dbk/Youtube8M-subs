you'll<00:00:00.630> prop<00:00:00.840> see<00:00:01.020> your<00:00:01.140> foundation<00:00:01.650> on<00:00:01.740> which

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:01.829 
you'll prop see your foundation on which

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:03.379 
you'll prop see your foundation on which
you<00:00:02.010> build<00:00:02.220> your<00:00:02.340> scrum<00:00:02.610> as<00:00:02.820> I've<00:00:03.120> shown<00:00:03.360> you

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
you build your scrum as I've shown you

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:05.329 
you build your scrum as I've shown you
previously<00:00:03.720> they've<00:00:04.620> got<00:00:04.799> to<00:00:04.890> keep<00:00:05.009> a<00:00:05.160> good

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
previously they've got to keep a good

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.340 
previously they've got to keep a good
low<00:00:05.460> body<00:00:05.790> height<00:00:06.089> so<00:00:06.720> they<00:00:06.870> get<00:00:07.020> lower<00:00:07.230> than

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
low body height so they get lower than

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:08.960 
low body height so they get lower than
their<00:00:07.560> opposite<00:00:07.950> prop<00:00:08.189> and<00:00:08.610> this<00:00:08.730> is<00:00:08.880> achieved

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
their opposite prop and this is achieved

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.810 
their opposite prop and this is achieved
by<00:00:09.300> keeping<00:00:09.719> their<00:00:09.840> hips<00:00:10.080> down<00:00:10.380> so<00:00:11.340> the<00:00:11.490> act<00:00:11.639> is

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
by keeping their hips down so the act is

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.610 
by keeping their hips down so the act is
an<00:00:11.940> effective<00:00:12.420> con<00:00:12.719> do<00:00:12.900> to<00:00:13.049> transfer<00:00:13.500> the

PACs engage the middle row shoulders

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.290 
PACs engage the middle row shoulders
should<00:00:19.410> be<00:00:19.439> on<00:00:19.710> to<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:19.980> props<00:00:20.220> hips<00:00:20.490> and<00:00:20.760> as

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
should be on to the props hips and as

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.179 
should be on to the props hips and as
you<00:00:21.420> can<00:00:21.539> see<00:00:21.689> in<00:00:21.810> this<00:00:21.900> illustration<00:00:22.080> if<00:00:22.800> the

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
you can see in this illustration if the

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.529 
you can see in this illustration if the
props<00:00:23.430> hips<00:00:23.670> are<00:00:23.820> too<00:00:23.970> high

props hips are too high

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.269 
props hips are too high
that'll<00:00:25.050> bring<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.260> middle<00:00:25.470> row<00:00:25.710> up<00:00:25.890> as<00:00:26.070> well

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
that'll bring the middle row up as well

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.519 
that'll bring the middle row up as well
and<00:00:26.580> they<00:00:26.970> won't<00:00:27.150> be<00:00:27.300> pushing<00:00:27.660> flat<00:00:27.990> straight

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
and they won't be pushing flat straight

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.950 
and they won't be pushing flat straight
through<00:00:28.769> to<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:28.920> opposition<00:00:29.779> let's<00:00:30.779> have<00:00:30.900> a

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
through to the opposition let's have a

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.630 
through to the opposition let's have a
look<00:00:31.080> an<00:00:31.199> example<00:00:31.320> of<00:00:31.769> how<00:00:31.949> this<00:00:32.130> works

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
look an example of how this works

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.209 
look an example of how this works
you<00:00:33.180> can<00:00:33.270> see<00:00:33.420> here<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.750> Waratahs<00:00:34.070> front<00:00:35.070> row

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
you can see here the Waratahs front row

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.430 
you can see here the Waratahs front row
keep<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.670> hips<00:00:35.969> down<00:00:36.270> which<00:00:36.870> enables<00:00:37.290> the

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
keep the hips down which enables the

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.799 
keep the hips down which enables the
middle<00:00:37.710> rows<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:38.100> also<00:00:38.430> stay<00:00:38.700> down<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.180> that

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
middle rows to also stay down and that

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.110 
middle rows to also stay down and that
means<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.200> whole<00:00:40.440> pack<00:00:40.770> is<00:00:41.489> pushing<00:00:41.910> it<00:00:42.030> the

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
means the whole pack is pushing it the

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.479 
means the whole pack is pushing it the
same<00:00:42.360> height<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:43.040> transferring<00:00:44.040> all<00:00:44.219> of<00:00:44.399> the

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
same height and transferring all of the

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:45.770 
same height and transferring all of the
weight<00:00:44.700> straight<00:00:45.210> through<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.690> the

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
weight straight through to the

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.670 
weight straight through to the
opposition<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:48.170> even<00:00:49.170> as<00:00:49.260> they<00:00:49.410> drive

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
opposition and even as they drive

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.740 
opposition and even as they drive
through<00:00:49.980> they<00:00:50.640> maintain<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.300> same<00:00:51.510> body

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
through they maintain the same body

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.660 
through they maintain the same body
height<00:00:52.079> which<00:00:52.620> means<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.010> whole<00:00:53.219> pack<00:00:53.489> is

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
height which means the whole pack is

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.029 
height which means the whole pack is
operating<00:00:54.149> on<00:00:54.239> one<00:00:54.510> plane<00:00:54.899> directing<00:00:55.860> all<00:00:56.010> of

operating on one plane directing all of

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.400 
operating on one plane directing all of
the<00:00:56.190> pressure<00:00:56.430> through<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.300> rebels<00:00:57.629> let's

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
the pressure through to the rebels let's

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.810 
the pressure through to the rebels let's
take<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.649> look<00:00:58.890> at<00:00:58.980> another<00:00:59.070> example<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.730> the

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
take a look at another example of the

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.160 
take a look at another example of the
Waratahs<00:01:00.059> pack<00:01:00.449> where<00:01:00.629> they're<00:01:00.719> not<00:01:00.780> quite<00:01:01.050> as

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
Waratahs pack where they're not quite as

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.110 
Waratahs pack where they're not quite as
effective<00:01:01.620> upon<00:01:02.070> engage<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.730> pack<00:01:02.940> is

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
effective upon engage the pack is

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.759 
effective upon engage the pack is
generally<00:01:03.660> at<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.809> same<00:01:04.080> height<00:01:04.350> pushing

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
generally at the same height pushing

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.130 
generally at the same height pushing
through<00:01:05.070> but<00:01:05.700> Dennis<00:01:06.030> is<00:01:06.210> lower<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.720> pushing

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
through but Dennis is lower and pushing

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.260 
through but Dennis is lower and pushing
down<00:01:07.170> and<00:01:07.680> Mullen<00:01:08.430> is<00:01:08.549> a<00:01:08.580> little<00:01:08.820> higher<00:01:09.030> and

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
pushing up as a result they're not all

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.280 
pushing up as a result they're not all
working<00:01:11.640> in<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.790> coordinated<00:01:12.060> way<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:13.200> they

rebels dominate the scrum here's another

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.270 
rebels dominate the scrum here's another
example<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.530> we'll<00:01:19.619> start<00:01:19.860> by<00:01:19.950> looking<00:01:19.979> at

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
example and we'll start by looking at

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.770 
example and we'll start by looking at
the<00:01:20.369> Wallabies<00:01:20.729> whilst<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.420> pack<00:01:21.600> is

important to be low and to be driving

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.580 
important to be low and to be driving
horizontal<00:01:30.390> it's<00:01:30.780> also<00:01:30.930> important<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.530> be

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
horizontal it's also important to be

enough the pack needs to work together
you<00:02:41.650> can<00:02:41.770> see<00:02:41.980> here<00:02:42.250> that<00:02:42.400> when<00:02:42.610> the<00:02:42.940> middle

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.050 
really tight so shoulders are locked
onto<00:02:55.930> the<00:02:56.200> props<00:02:56.470> so<00:02:57.460> that<00:02:57.580> when<00:02:57.700> we<00:02:57.790> get<00:02:57.940> to

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
onto the props so that when we get to

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.600 
onto the props so that when we get to

you can see in the example here that

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.360 
you can see in the example here that
clearly<00:03:04.390> the<00:03:04.600> English<00:03:04.870> lock<00:03:05.140> wasn't<00:03:05.950> bound
