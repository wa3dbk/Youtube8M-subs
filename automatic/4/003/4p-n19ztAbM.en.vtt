00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.219
 hello everyone today let's learn to 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.480
 make this top so beautiful in the first 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:15.480
 part the patterns 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:21.170
 good as always we started everything with a 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:23.210
 I draw that the design of the top we're going 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.980
 to do that you have already seen it finished and 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.080
 to pepito how nice we are going to do 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.230
 the patterns according to this drawing that 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:33.320
 we have here we have our patterns 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.540
 basic up to the waist the front and 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.790
 the butt up here we have it in the 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.000
 channel I'll leave a link if it's the 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:44.180
 first time you see me and you do not know how to get there 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.190
 So far the link will only see it if 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.710
 you are watching the video on the computer if 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.710
 I do not know how to discuss looking at the pattern 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.880
 back instead of with the blade 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.160
 double as I have done on other occasions 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.960
 how my brace is going to come to the clip 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.809
 contrary what I have done has been 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.270
 through the center of the clamp until 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.039
 the center of my employer and he has given me 8 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.950
 centimeter and a half and that's what I 've put 

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:09.020
 here so he has lengthened these together 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.450
 where will you come or suspenders to be able 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.820
 do now the transformation amos with 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.979
 the transformation looks let's remove 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.480
 we are the waist is the waist 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:21.810
 up to my waist, I 'm going to go up 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:24.790
 my shirt two centimeters above 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.280
 from the waist 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.210
 let's make a straight line there 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.580
 because myth 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.190
 will reach two centimeters above 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:37.040
 from the waist now we have taken a 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.890
 Extra measure from the armpit to below 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:43.640
 from the chest or where my bra arrives 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:46.430
 to know where the myth will reach me 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.460
 the one that has to get me to take here 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:53.170
 under the chest well then how do you 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.170
 it has to get under the chest 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:02:00.160
 Well, it's eight centimeters, I'm going to mark 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:03.220
 here we have my asylum in a which is here 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:05.810
 in the pattern so that it serves them as 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.820
 concerning 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.780
 this is for my daughter and are the measures 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:13.330
 so here we have other girls 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.500
 all right 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:20.320
 now I'm going to bring my suspenders look at the 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.480
 braces back as you are seeing in the 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.510
 drawing from the line below the 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:29.260
 chest up man so I have 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:32.320
 that I start to draw there I'm going to put it 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:35.620
 there two centimeters two centimeters and 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:38.110
 minutes of the male center, I'm going to 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.420
 do here a straight line and like my 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.550
 brace has to measure three centimeters 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.120
 which is the same as what my rule measures 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:48.030
 I'm going to do this 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:51.569
 and I'm going to bring it in and here I have my 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:54.840
 tight front now the only thing I'm going to 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:57.930
 do is draw my neckline that I'm going to 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:01.190
 put about 4 centimeters below the 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.190
 neck as I saw there 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.329
 and now 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.990
 will come to me I have to make a line 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.460
 here to the appointment 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.650
 is born 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:16.320
 and well here I have stayed a little 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.820
 more let's see to see myself better not 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.100
 I want to draw what they have to me 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.650
 Marine 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:25.160
 It has to be on the same line as the 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.050
 same height 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:31.200
 so as not to be wrong 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:34.710
 How I have to stay at that height 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:38.420
 I'm going to redraw 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:38.420
 so that I stay pretty 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:44.450
 so that's how I have not even 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.020
 well I'm going to mark what is allow before 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.020
 Forward 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:56.090
 lead 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:59.300
 and here we have the transformation of the 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:02.120
 top finished this line does not follow the 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:04.370
 back pattern what we have done has 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.940
 been already drawn is very simple 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:10.069
 look I had to face shoulder with 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.930
 shoulder but expecting that we put the 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:14.150
 armholes together and the neck together too 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:17.209
 we do not turn around I've taken the 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.919
 measure of where I have marked where the 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.359
 tight so that they fit me right in their 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:22.880
 site in the two men I do not stay 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:25.490
 twisted I brought it here to the clamp 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:27.889
 contrary as we remember was the measure 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:30.050
 of the rule so I 've brought the rule to 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:32.540
 where would my counter clip come from and here 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:34.070
 I have already marked my tie and here what 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:37.870
 only thing I have had to do is go up 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:41.450
 two centimeters from the waist but 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:43.729
 although I have done my employer 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:46.580
 So my boss is not that that was 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:49.460
 to draw the tie just for 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:52.310
 to be able to cross tie with my 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:57.039
 shoulder shape is correct and not 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:57.039
 give me trouble be in my back pattern 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:55.410
 one 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:57.900
 I've already cut it out of there look what 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:00.630
 is done here we have the side of the 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:04.260
 fabric becomes a l 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:07.350
 one l there an angle of 90 degrees and this 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:10.290
 that we have here this on the web that 

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:13.139
 we are left as you see the 10 that look 

00:06:10.290 --> 00:06:15.330
 as we would cut back here 

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:19.229
 from here , 3 centimeters strips 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:21.300
 as we already have here here I already have 

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:25.080
 cut my feet is that I'm going to need 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:27.720
 to put it we have cut all 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:30.990
 our pieces the part from below 2 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:34.110
 with the double cloth we have here here 

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:36.510
 the two laterals the central part 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:38.850
 that equips with the double cloth the 

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:40.620
 braces that are four we have four 

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:42.570
 parties and that I have not left anything of 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:45.120
 sewing because I'm going to put a foot to 

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:47.310
 each side I have done the same with the 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:49.590
 rear braces and here we have the 

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:52.700
 part of the back waist that brings us the 

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:56.120
 palm with sewing all around 

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:59.270
 and the strip for the suspenders that I'm going to 

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:02.150
 need good because we already have here 

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:04.340
 all cut the patterns the cut and in 

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:06.350
