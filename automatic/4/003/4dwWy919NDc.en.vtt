00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
across North Wales it should be fine

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.910

with lots of sunshine around we might

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.709 
with lots of sunshine around we might
just<00:01:59.130> have<00:01:59.219> a<00:01:59.369> few<00:01:59.610> showers<00:01:59.790> across<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.540> north

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
just have a few showers across the north

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.780

and west of Scotland as we enter the
morning<00:02:03.119> but<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:03.659> think<00:02:03.840> by<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.049> afternoon

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560

we'll<00:02:04.890> slowly<00:02:05.130> see<00:02:05.399> those<00:02:05.579> showers<00:02:05.909> fading

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
we'll slowly see those showers fading

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.609 
we'll slowly see those showers fading
away<00:02:06.329> so<00:02:06.450> they'll<00:02:06.750> just<00:02:06.960> be<00:02:07.110> one<00:02:07.320> or<00:02:07.439> two

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
away so they'll just be one or two

away so they'll just be one or two
