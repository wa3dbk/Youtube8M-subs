00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
so if you hadn't gotten a roots magic

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.740 
so if you hadn't gotten a roots magic
kit<00:00:07.770> and<00:00:08.400> you<00:00:08.970> want<00:00:09.179> to<00:00:09.240> know<00:00:09.360> how<00:00:09.540> it<00:00:09.630> works

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
kit and you want to know how it works

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.209 
kit and you want to know how it works
well<00:00:10.530> I'm<00:00:11.519> gonna<00:00:11.790> show<00:00:12.030> you<00:00:12.679> and<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:13.889> reason<00:00:14.130> I

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
well I'm gonna show you and the reason I

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.770 
well I'm gonna show you and the reason I
think<00:00:14.340> in<00:00:14.460> this<00:00:14.549> video<00:00:14.849> is<00:00:15.059> because<00:00:15.269> when<00:00:15.630> I

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
think in this video is because when I

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.930 
think in this video is because when I
was<00:00:15.809> going<00:00:16.470> to<00:00:16.650> get<00:00:16.800> my<00:00:16.890> Rubik's<00:00:17.190> magic<00:00:17.609> but<00:00:17.880> I

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
was going to get my Rubik's magic but I

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.210 
was going to get my Rubik's magic but I
hadn't<00:00:18.210> bought<00:00:18.300> it<00:00:18.449> yet<00:00:18.600> I<00:00:18.920> really<00:00:19.920> wanted<00:00:20.130> to

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
hadn't bought it yet I really wanted to

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.939 
hadn't bought it yet I really wanted to
know<00:00:20.340> how<00:00:20.520> it<00:00:20.609> worked<00:00:20.789> but<00:00:21.029> I<00:00:21.800> couldn't<00:00:22.800> find

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
know how it worked but I couldn't find

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.259 
know how it worked but I couldn't find
anything<00:00:23.189> so<00:00:24.529> it's<00:00:25.529> pretty<00:00:25.859> much<00:00:26.060> it<00:00:27.060> pretty

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
anything so it's pretty much it pretty

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.169 
anything so it's pretty much it pretty
much<00:00:27.390> works<00:00:27.720> with<00:00:28.080> these<00:00:28.380> little<00:00:28.590> strings

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:29.179 
much works with these little strings

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:37.580 
much works with these little strings
that<00:00:32.120> are<00:00:33.710> strung<00:00:34.710> through<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.160> whole<00:00:36.590> thing

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
that are strung through the whole thing

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.680 
that are strung through the whole thing
so<00:00:38.070> that<00:00:38.840> it<00:00:39.840> can<00:00:40.140> go<00:00:40.910> and<00:00:41.910> move<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.360> ways<00:00:42.510> it

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
so that it can go and move the ways it

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.350 
so that it can go and move the ways it
does<00:00:43.399> so<00:00:44.570> if<00:00:45.570> I<00:00:45.780> wanted<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.110> go<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.739> hold<00:00:47.360> these

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
does so if I wanted to go and hold these

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.100 
does so if I wanted to go and hold these
two<00:00:48.750> that<00:00:49.489> hold<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.670> in<00:00:50.700> half<00:00:50.969> and<00:00:51.590> open<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.680> up

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
two that hold it in half and open it up

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:00.979 
two that hold it in half and open it up
networks<00:00:55.110> because<00:00:56.420> if<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:58.760> look<00:00:59.760> see<00:01:00.390> with<00:01:00.780> this

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
networks because if I look see with this

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.860 
networks because if I look see with this
in<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.530> middle<00:01:01.800> part<00:01:02.039> you<00:01:02.820> can<00:01:02.969> already<00:01:03.300> open

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
in the middle part you can already open

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.620 
in the middle part you can already open
it<00:01:03.960> up<00:01:04.610> because<00:01:05.610> there's<00:01:05.790> no<00:01:05.909> wires<00:01:06.150> crossing

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
it up because there's no wires crossing

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.630 
it up because there's no wires crossing
any<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.590> these<00:01:07.680> parts<00:01:08.659> so<00:01:10.189> these<00:01:11.189> you<00:01:11.369> fold

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
any of these parts so these you fold

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:23.480 
any of these parts so these you fold
back<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:13.700> it<00:01:14.700> can<00:01:14.880> all<00:01:16.939> open<00:01:17.939> up<00:01:18.650> so<00:01:21.560> but<00:01:22.560> you

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
back and it can all open up so but you

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:35.719 
back and it can all open up so but you
can't<00:01:25.580> hold<00:01:26.580> them<00:01:27.060> back<00:01:29.840> and<00:01:33.290> like<00:01:34.520> if<00:01:35.520> you're

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
can't hold them back and like if you're

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.240 
can't hold them back and like if you're
folding<00:01:36.000> it<00:01:36.270> like<00:01:36.329> this<00:01:36.799> you<00:01:37.799> can't<00:01:38.009> pull<00:01:38.220> it

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
folding it like this you can't pull it

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.499 
folding it like this you can't pull it
apart<00:01:38.340> right<00:01:38.579> now<00:01:38.900> because<00:01:41.119> little<00:01:42.119> wires<00:01:42.299> on

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
apart right now because little wires on

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.830 
apart right now because little wires on
this<00:01:42.659> side<00:01:42.899> they<00:01:43.829> switch<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:45.149> track<00:01:45.600> that

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
this side they switch the track that

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.230 
this side they switch the track that
they're<00:01:46.020> on<00:01:46.140> so<00:01:46.979> then<00:01:47.399> they<00:01:47.659> can<00:01:48.659> open<00:01:49.259> up<00:01:49.380> or

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
they're on so then they can open up or

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:56.469 
they're on so then they can open up or
let<00:01:51.240> you<00:01:51.479> open<00:01:51.930> the<00:01:52.079> Rubik's<00:01:52.799> magic<00:01:53.159> up<00:01:53.659> so

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
let you open the Rubik's magic up so

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.620 
let you open the Rubik's magic up so
then<00:01:57.479> they<00:01:57.869> have<00:01:58.649> these<00:01:58.890> little<00:01:59.390> metal<00:02:00.390> things

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
then they have these little metal things

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:07.600 
then they have these little metal things
right<00:02:00.869> there<00:02:03.649> right<00:02:04.649> in<00:02:04.680> there

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.220 

that<00:02:08.770> just<00:02:09.770> hold<00:02:09.979> the<00:02:10.100> strings<00:02:10.369> in<00:02:10.520> place<00:02:11.230> so

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
that just hold the strings in place so

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.120 
that just hold the strings in place so
sort<00:02:13.010> of<00:02:13.070> hard<00:02:13.250> to<00:02:13.280> see<00:02:13.460> with<00:02:13.580> the<00:02:13.670> camera<00:02:14.090> but

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
sort of hard to see with the camera but

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.390 
sort of hard to see with the camera but
if<00:02:16.930> if<00:02:17.930> I<00:02:18.110> had<00:02:18.230> a<00:02:18.260> better<00:02:18.470> camera<00:02:18.770> you'd<00:02:19.220> be

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
if if I had a better camera you'd be

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.970 
if if I had a better camera you'd be
able<00:02:19.490> to<00:02:19.640> see<00:02:19.910> oh<00:02:20.410> yeah<00:02:21.410> you<00:02:21.530> sort<00:02:21.740> of<00:02:21.800> can't

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
able to see oh yeah you sort of can't

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.750 
able to see oh yeah you sort of can't
see<00:02:22.190> the<00:02:22.790> strings<00:02:23.180> switching<00:02:23.690> over<00:02:25.150> like<00:02:26.230> from

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
see the strings switching over like from

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.040 
see the strings switching over like from
side<00:02:28.760> to<00:02:28.790> side<00:02:30.010> all<00:02:31.010> right

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
side to side all right

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.880 
side to side all right
it's<00:02:33.050> not<00:02:33.170> hard<00:02:33.410> to<00:02:33.500> keep<00:02:33.620> it<00:02:33.740> in<00:02:33.830> this

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
it's not hard to keep it in this

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.880 
it's not hard to keep it in this
position<00:02:34.400> with<00:02:34.550> one<00:02:34.580> hand<00:02:35.709> right<00:02:36.709> in<00:02:36.830> the

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
position with one hand right in the

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.560 
position with one hand right in the
middle<00:02:37.040> there<00:02:37.280> so<00:02:39.910> it's<00:02:40.910> pretty<00:02:41.060> much<00:02:41.300> how<00:02:41.510> it

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
middle there so it's pretty much how it

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.910 
middle there so it's pretty much how it
works<00:02:41.720> and<00:02:43.270> otherwise<00:02:44.270> I<00:02:44.600> don't<00:02:44.770> really<00:02:45.770> know

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
works and otherwise I don't really know

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.500 
works and otherwise I don't really know
how<00:02:46.250> to<00:02:46.989> string<00:02:47.989> it<00:02:48.020> again<00:02:48.320> if<00:02:48.590> you<00:02:49.510> broke

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
how to string it again if you broke

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.720 
how to string it again if you broke
yours<00:02:50.770> so<00:02:51.770> don't<00:02:53.110> ask<00:02:54.110> me<00:02:54.350> so<00:02:54.709> thanks<00:02:55.640> for
