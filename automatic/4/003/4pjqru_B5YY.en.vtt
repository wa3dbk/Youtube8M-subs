00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:11.700
 hello how about android friends and we're 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:13.920
 with this game that the truth is 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.980
 pretty good I think it's much better 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.680
 that the flop and see is called timberman yes 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.689
 yes we go to the option of characters 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.630
 we have many characters that 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.779
 we can obviously select these 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.250
 characters are blocked if 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.220
 they want to buy all the characters 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.840
 it costs 14 pesos as if 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:38.370
 we want to buy this the game without 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.199
 advertising costs 14 pesos look how 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.929
 you can see the minister-president who 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:45.149
 it looks like obama and instead of hold it 

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:47.699
 they put bulk and so good to go to for example 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.859
 there is the civil if there is 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:51.480
 many characters that we can 

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:54.089
 find 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.410
 in this game that the truth is 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:58.210
 pretty good 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.989
 so let's try it so that what 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:06.570
 see here the idea is to play it as much 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.570
 fast that you can go pressing 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:14.500
 and in this way is the game the truth 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.940
 is very very very very very this addictive 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.740
 as you can see on the top 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.580
 I have my best record there 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:24.770
 are 143 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.770
 so let's see if I can break it 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.770
 I tell them the idea is to do it as 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.770
 fast as you can 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:41.770

 Well, with this we are going to say goodbye 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.830
 the game weighs 11 megabytes I tell them what 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.620
 we can find completely free 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.989
 in the play store 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:57.739
 and with this last one we already said goodbye 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:59.690
 see if we break the record almost almost 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:02.000
 we broke the record the truth the game 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:05.720
 it's pretty good friends I tell you 11 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.599
 megas weighs this game and if we want the 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.340
 version without advertising costs 14 pesos 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:12.799
 Mexicans something like a dollar 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.890
 approximately and well good friends that 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:16.690
