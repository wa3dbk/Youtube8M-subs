00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.060 
nothing special it's just white paint if
you<00:01:21.450> don't<00:01:21.600> have<00:01:21.750> paint<00:01:22.200> or<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:22.710> don't<00:01:22.890> have

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
you don't have paint or you don't have

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.679 
you don't have paint or you don't have
needles<00:01:23.460> or<00:01:23.729> whatever<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.210> can<00:01:24.360> use<00:01:24.390> hot<00:01:24.659> glue

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
needles or whatever you can use hot glue

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.690 
needles or whatever you can use hot glue
or<00:01:26.360> maybe<00:01:27.360> just<00:01:27.570> glue<00:01:27.869> just<00:01:28.710> plain<00:01:29.189> old<00:01:29.400> glue

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
or maybe just glue just plain old glue

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.359 
or maybe just glue just plain old glue
might<00:01:29.970> work<00:01:30.180> too<00:01:30.509> or<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.200> key<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.710> use<00:01:31.799> fabric

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
might work too or a key to use fabric

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.999 
might work too or a key to use fabric
paint<00:01:32.540> that<00:01:33.540> would<00:01:33.659> probably<00:01:33.930> work<00:01:34.079> too<00:01:34.380> or

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
paint that would probably work too or

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.770 
paint that would probably work too or
and<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.640> if<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:35.909> have<00:01:36.119> none<00:01:36.329> of<00:01:36.450> those<00:01:36.570> you

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
and and if you have none of those you

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.170 
and and if you have none of those you
could<00:01:36.900> use<00:01:37.320> probably<00:01:37.799> nail<00:01:38.280> polish<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.060> I'm

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
could use probably nail polish and I'm

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.789 
could use probably nail polish and I'm
pretty<00:01:39.360> sure<00:01:39.450> nail<00:01:39.720> polish<00:01:40.079> would<00:01:40.259> still<00:01:40.590> work

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
pretty sure nail polish would still work

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.469 
pretty sure nail polish would still work
so<00:01:41.270> anyways<00:01:42.270> this<00:01:42.450> is<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.659> very<00:01:44.270> household<00:01:45.270> eek

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
inch and a half to two inches not too

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.910 
inch and a half to two inches not too
big<00:02:13.890> because<00:02:14.190> I<00:02:14.400> don't<00:02:15.080> you<00:02:16.080> know<00:02:16.170> like<00:02:16.530> it<00:02:16.739> to

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
big because I don't you know like it to

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.250 
big because I don't you know like it to
be<00:02:17.010> that<00:02:17.220> huge<00:02:17.489> so<00:02:17.790> anyways<00:02:18.150> so<00:02:18.810> you<00:02:18.870> can<00:02:19.050> see

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
be that huge so anyways so you can see

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.990 
be that huge so anyways so you can see
right<00:02:19.470> now<00:02:19.500> there's<00:02:19.920> like<00:02:20.220> a<00:02:20.250> little<00:02:20.430> slit<00:02:20.850> in

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
right now there's like a little slit in

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.300 
right now there's like a little slit in
the<00:02:21.030> fabric<00:02:21.569> so<00:02:21.870> all<00:02:22.500> you're<00:02:22.680> gonna<00:02:22.800> do<00:02:23.069> is

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
the fabric so all you're gonna do is

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.260 
the fabric so all you're gonna do is
just<00:02:23.520> pull<00:02:24.110> pull<00:02:25.110> that<00:02:25.260> slip<00:02:25.920> and<00:02:26.580> it's<00:02:27.030> gonna

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
just pull pull that slip and it's gonna

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.660 
just pull pull that slip and it's gonna
rip<00:02:28.140> your<00:02:28.410> fabric<00:02:28.860> straight<00:02:29.160> down<00:02:29.370> in<00:02:29.610> a

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
rip your fabric straight down in a

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.000 
rip your fabric straight down in a
straight<00:02:29.940> line<00:02:30.170> because<00:02:31.170> that's<00:02:31.530> what<00:02:31.680> fabric

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
straight line because that's what fabric

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.710 
straight line because that's what fabric
does<00:02:32.220> it's<00:02:32.670> pretty<00:02:32.880> awesome<00:02:33.300> if<00:02:33.390> you<00:02:33.480> didn't

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
does it's pretty awesome if you didn't

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.460 
does it's pretty awesome if you didn't
know<00:02:33.810> once<00:02:34.200> you<00:02:34.380> have<00:02:34.560> this<00:02:35.060> strip<00:02:36.060> of<00:02:36.090> fabric

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
know once you have this strip of fabric

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.660 
know once you have this strip of fabric
what<00:02:37.470> you're<00:02:37.560> gonna<00:02:37.650> do<00:02:38.010> is<00:02:39.920> cut<00:02:40.920> probably

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
what you're gonna do is cut probably

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.940 
what you're gonna do is cut probably
another<00:02:42.269> like<00:02:42.540> three<00:02:43.080> to<00:02:43.200> four<00:02:43.410> inches<00:02:43.680> down

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
another like three to four inches down

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.910 
another like three to four inches down
like<00:02:44.280> not<00:02:44.880> too<00:02:45.330> long<00:02:45.750> because<00:02:46.200> I'm<00:02:46.590> sure<00:02:46.800> your

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
like not too long because I'm sure your

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.890 
like not too long because I'm sure your
dreads<00:02:47.160> aren't<00:02:47.400> that<00:02:47.550> thick<00:02:47.610> so<00:02:48.180> this<00:02:48.660> is<00:02:48.810> the

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
dreads aren't that thick so this is the

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.300 
dreads aren't that thick so this is the
part<00:02:49.140> that<00:02:49.170> you're<00:02:49.350> gonna<00:02:49.470> wrap<00:02:49.739> around<00:02:50.160> your

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
part that you're gonna wrap around your

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.130 
part that you're gonna wrap around your
dreads<00:02:50.550> so<00:02:50.819> you<00:02:51.390> don't<00:02:51.510> want<00:02:51.630> to<00:02:51.690> make<00:02:51.750> it<00:02:51.900> too

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
dreads so you don't want to make it too

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.240 
dreads so you don't want to make it too
long<00:02:52.380> or<00:02:52.590> too<00:02:53.040> short<00:02:53.069> so<00:02:53.850> I'm<00:02:54.360> gonna<00:02:54.510> cut<00:02:54.750> mine

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
long or too short so I'm gonna cut mine

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:02.240 
long or too short so I'm gonna cut mine
about<00:02:56.250> here<00:02:56.790> probably<00:03:00.170> if<00:03:01.170> you<00:03:01.350> want<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:01.680> ends

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
about here probably if you want the ends

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.820 
about here probably if you want the ends

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
to be leader

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.289 
to be leader
you<00:03:05.160> could<00:03:05.340> probably<00:03:05.579> cuz<00:03:05.970> like<00:03:06.120> they're

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
you could probably cuz like they're

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.150 
you could probably cuz like they're
really<00:03:06.480> afraid<00:03:06.720> if<00:03:07.470> you<00:03:07.650> wanted<00:03:07.860> them<00:03:07.980> to<00:03:08.070> be

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
really afraid if you wanted them to be

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.640 
really afraid if you wanted them to be

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
neater probably just using scissors you

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.949 
neater probably just using scissors you
could<00:03:10.890> do<00:03:11.010> it<00:03:11.130> a<00:03:11.160> lot<00:03:11.340> neater<00:03:11.489> I<00:03:12.420> don't<00:03:12.810> have

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.289 
could do it a lot neater I don't have
scissors<00:03:13.170> though<00:03:13.590> and<00:03:13.890> I<00:03:14.459> kind<00:03:14.940> of<00:03:15.000> like<00:03:15.180> the

scissors though and I kind of like the

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:18.560 
scissors though and I kind of like the
way<00:03:15.390> it<00:03:15.480> looks<00:03:15.660> all<00:03:15.900> like<00:03:16.130> frazzled<00:03:17.130> so<00:03:18.120> now

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
around so that the ends overlap so if

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:31.610 
around so that the ends overlap so if
they<00:03:30.420> overlap<00:03:30.750> a<00:03:30.780> lot<00:03:31.049> that's<00:03:31.290> fine

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
they overlap a lot that's fine

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.400 
they overlap a lot that's fine
or<00:03:31.829> just<00:03:31.980> a<00:03:32.100> little<00:03:32.130> that's<00:03:32.640> fine<00:03:32.940> too<00:03:33.290> you<00:03:34.290> can

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
or just a little that's fine too you can

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.560 
or just a little that's fine too you can
see<00:03:34.530> that<00:03:34.680> but<00:03:34.859> just<00:03:35.310> overlaps<00:03:35.880> just<00:03:36.269> a<00:03:36.390> little

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
see that but just overlaps just a little

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.560 
see that but just overlaps just a little
bit<00:03:36.660> like<00:03:36.780> that<00:03:36.810> take<00:03:37.350> your<00:03:37.799> glue<00:03:38.130> or<00:03:38.519> paint<00:03:39.209> or

right on the edge

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.690 
right on the edge
I<00:04:06.260> just<00:04:06.770> painted<00:04:07.100> about<00:04:07.370> a<00:04:09.520> quarter<00:04:10.520> of<00:04:10.610> an

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
I just painted about a quarter of an

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.670 
I just painted about a quarter of an
inch<00:04:10.850> past<00:04:11.450> because<00:04:12.110> that's<00:04:12.290> as<00:04:12.410> far<00:04:12.530> as<00:04:12.590> my

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
inch past because that's as far as my

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.550 
inch past because that's as far as my
father<00:04:12.980> goes<00:04:13.250> you're<00:04:13.700> just<00:04:13.880> gonna<00:04:14.000> take<00:04:14.560> the

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
father goes you're just gonna take the

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.150 
father goes you're just gonna take the
part<00:04:15.890> that<00:04:16.190> you<00:04:16.310> fold<00:04:16.520> it<00:04:16.640> over<00:04:16.730> initially<00:04:18.160> and

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
part that you fold it over initially and

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.570 
part that you fold it over initially and
you're<00:04:19.370> gonna<00:04:19.460> flatten<00:04:19.820> this<00:04:20.060> out<00:04:20.270> and<00:04:21.580> fold

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
you're gonna flatten this out and fold

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.290 
you're gonna flatten this out and fold
it<00:04:22.820> over<00:04:23.090> again<00:04:24.430> so<00:04:25.430> it'll<00:04:25.670> just<00:04:25.700> look<00:04:26.000> kind<00:04:26.180> of

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
it over again so it'll just look kind of

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.390 
it over again so it'll just look kind of
like<00:04:26.420> this<00:04:26.480> right<00:04:27.230> now<00:04:27.440> I'm<00:04:27.650> just<00:04:27.830> like<00:04:28.040> a

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:28.400 
like this right now I'm just like a

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.840 
like this right now I'm just like a
level<00:04:29.980> two<00:04:30.980> bone<00:04:31.340> there

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
level two bone there

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.480 
level two bone there
I<00:04:31.880> noticed<00:04:32.330> that<00:04:32.390> mine<00:04:32.810> is<00:04:33.110> a<00:04:33.770> little<00:04:34.340> bit

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
I noticed that mine is a little bit

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.460 
I noticed that mine is a little bit
loose<00:04:34.850> still<00:04:35.180> around<00:04:35.330> the<00:04:35.450> edge<00:04:35.570> and<00:04:35.900> I<00:04:36.020> really

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
loose still around the edge and I really

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:42.670 
loose still around the edge and I really
don't<00:04:36.620> want<00:04:36.950> it<00:04:37.190> to<00:04:37.400> come<00:04:37.580> apart<00:04:39.190> see<00:04:41.560> you<00:04:42.560> can

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
don't want it to come apart see you can

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.470 
don't want it to come apart see you can
see<00:04:42.800> it's<00:04:42.920> kind<00:04:43.160> of<00:04:43.220> still<00:04:43.430> oles<00:04:43.790> so<00:04:44.300> I'm<00:04:44.390> gonna

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:44.480 
see it's kind of still oles so I'm gonna

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.240 
see it's kind of still oles so I'm gonna
take<00:04:44.660> some<00:04:44.720> of<00:04:44.990> the<00:04:45.050> paint<00:04:45.350> and<00:04:45.560> just<00:04:45.650> dab<00:04:46.070> it

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
take some of the paint and just dab it

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:54.840 
take some of the paint and just dab it
on<00:04:46.430> the<00:04:46.610> top<00:04:48.010> and<00:04:49.010> just<00:04:49.130> push<00:04:49.670> it<00:04:49.790> down<00:04:49.820> so<00:04:51.970> that

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
on the top and just push it down so that

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:59.110 
on the top and just push it down so that
and<00:04:56.260> hopefully<00:04:57.260> stays<00:04:58.040> there

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
and hopefully stays there

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.210 
and hopefully stays there
if<00:04:59.450> using<00:04:59.870> paint<00:05:00.170> probably<00:05:00.680> trying<00:05:01.010> gonna
