00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:07.750
 and the market we moved to the house 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:09.880
 from americas the good I like it in addition 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.740
 let's take a tecito yes good 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.690
 for good for you and for anything 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.119
 It is not a tray with a nice design 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.500
 who made a homemade alicia alicia that 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:19.810
 good is always designing all these 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.980
 interesting things and you stay the 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.990
 part against colo is also very 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.929
 simple that now we are going to improve with 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.519
 all this vintage line that are here 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:29.529
 we have the sconces that are 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:30.820
 trimmed and then good the part of the 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:32.710
 paper with what are the combinations 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.090
 of the guards actually a combination 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.090
 very simple but that gives a good effect 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.600
 how do that alicia the mini that there is already 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.670
 a technique that we have from the study 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.260
 we know how to make a crackle 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:53.290
 controlled then one can do 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:55.300
 crackle medium small or large the 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.280
 people should be thinking look let's go to 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.750
 show a little ant to the place from where 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.430
 everything that is made arises there is a 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.710
 tray to house we have the effect everything has 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.449
 basically placed in the tray 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.630
 a design made with pencil to know 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.640
 where are we going to control each of the 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.640
 and then if we see here a little the 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.740
 breakdown that we have from the apply 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.020
 original that comes in this size that 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.700
 are 10 x 10 kaka we see it loose from 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.740
 there the edges were cut out where they come out 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.320
 the circles to that circle you can 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.659
 cut in four parts how is that and 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.569
 also within the same circle it comes out 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.490
 this other smaller one after the 

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:32.130
 keep these that come here are cut 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.350
 the strips and these are the elements with 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.210
 which we are going to start what 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.100
 is the counter red here I already started 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.259
 with some placing some guards 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.539
 let's put one more in actually the 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.490
 design can be as one likes me 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:46.770
 whenever we have an original like him 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.349
 wanted alicia can be modified from 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.360
 done we are going to use other papers here 

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:53.459
 placed a guard nothing else but could 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.649
 place two guards or surround it all with 

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:57.569
 you keep but let's do good 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.140
 practical very simple this already 

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:02.549
 previously I have to hide that to 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.709
 hidden we have two options 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.649
 previously you take out a mold for later 

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:09.209
 to be able to support it on the application and 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.630
 So here I know exactly what 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.660
 you need 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:18.930
 if you do not take measures and you also take what 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:25.390
 that we are going to control in circles 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:28.840
 bigger I'll go very well in the 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:31.480
 cut is going to come out all right well yes 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.670
 yes tell me look at this let's put it to 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.830
 same as I say if you will spend a 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.660
 little bit even though this does not exist is 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.750
 calculated much more as it was painted 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:43.510
 of brown on the edges you can 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.540
 correct that cute work against casting 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.690
 and it's fabulous 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:53.170
 almost the year ten years in a good 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:55.420
 launch of what the technique is is 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.610
 very pretty and how did you come up with miguel and 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.820
 is that you know how to get your hands when 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:03.070
 You do more than 15 years ago out there 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.510
 from what is taken advantage of what 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.010
 were the countries or what the painting 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.330
 all this came up 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.190
 see how we already have everything that 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.860
 is this structure against cute colara 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.130
 now I could that I like a 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.130
 Brown 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.890
 look at this we can control it whole one 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.080
 option so that you do not get hit 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.060
 bet if you want one in this case a 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.819
 rule so that to be able to move it and 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.860
 give it to locate you see it for example in 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:31.130
 she to avoid two sides to cut 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:33.530
 distances and place it on one side pulled out and 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:36.140
 everything went well then first itchy 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:40.459
 everything what are the edges for just 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:42.170
 there to mark although it is the central part if 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:44.120
 once you have it more or less 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:47.480
 located simply what needs to be done 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:50.510
 how it gets more comfortable to scale it there 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.400
 but I'm seeing then it was like 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.080
 you put the blade of the slow slim 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.299
 adobes just bowed and what I do is 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.850
 follow the way you have 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:00.799
 looking at the piece if in this case if for 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.470
 more for more comfort 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:05.590
 look how good the edges the excess of 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.390
 the edges were 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:09.190
 you have to try to do the most accurate 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.720
 possible to avoid after they have to 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.209
 place sandpaper although afterwards you can 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.370
 leave but of course you have to link a 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:16.900
 little bit and this is something shown but 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.430
 good there are always new people who want 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.370
 know how it is done so you do not stay 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.590
 vos edges towards blade commas 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.710
 is and I put it down and the cut is 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:29.199
 down then downward 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.060
 I can take out everything that is the edge 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:34.030
 No one will repeat bitter 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:37.900
 brand bow to know where is support 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:40.720
 the blade exactly on the edge and 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:43.450
 down if I want I can go back 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:46.360
 to climb down there I make the cut 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:50.340
 because here to see the million dollar question 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:53.229
 million hotels put the author could 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:55.240
 the turn sticks on the other side 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:57.100
 work on these basis of court in 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.600
 reality not to nothing do not see if you listen to me 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.580
 look with the same leftover and you look 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:03.010
 I can do it here with the rule 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.080
 correct it or if not directly I'll 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.539
 let a little going on 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:09.280
 he marked it before person is installed by 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:10.449
 every time I can mark it and I can 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.849
 cut 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:16.569
 once placed then one takes advantage 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:18.129
 exactly everything now I'm going to dedicate 

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:20.529
 while six against straining one 

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:22.779
 very fast question is the quantity 

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:25.629
 of people or the one who sends me message 

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:28.059
 while messages like they end 

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:30.339
 the pieces the any piece with 

00:05:28.059 --> 00:05:32.169
 remembered painted and so on 

00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:35.439
 paris that barnes and liquid glass 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:36.909
 how it applies and that depends on the case 

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:39.279
 the counter strained as the paper gives me 

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:40.539
 comes because they are listening in the case 

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:42.759
 of the against casting as the paper be 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:45.099
 It has a matte anti and reflex protection 

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:47.319
 makes it enabled so that you can 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:48.330
 put a varnish to the water a varnish 

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:50.710
 Sun 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.479
 converses preferably water that 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:54.879
 are artistic products varnishes for 

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:56.889
 for art not the common varnishes 

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:58.569
 that is, on the paper against 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:01.360
 specifically cast to anyone without 

00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:03.550
 home neither brush the blowtorch on 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.110
 spray can you place the two resin 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.879
 components that is the glass effect or the 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.349
 liquid glass that shit is left 

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:10.120
 You can also put it because 

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:13.089
 being protected the paper will not affect 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:14.800
 what is the ink of the paper and in the 

00:06:13.089 --> 00:06:16.060
 case on acrylic on other paintings 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.830
 like the acrylic 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.720
 in general people work with bases 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:22.450
 acrylic paint all the decorative 

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:24.669
 with the water and the sieve will be the water 

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:26.410
 lean flame what is lean I can 

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:27.850
 place something fatty or something mature on 

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:29.860
 that means that on an acrylic 

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:31.690
 I can put a varnish in the water 

00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:33.610
 solvent to white spirit after putting 

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:35.560
 that I want about a criticism now this 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:37.960
 piece that I made acb divin because it's 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:39.430
 advanced has a varnish that is 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:42.610
 flame of the general type that is a varnish 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:45.130
