the<00:01:27.719> pink<00:01:28.020> line<00:01:28.140> on<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.649> graph<00:01:28.890> is<00:01:29.250> rpm<00:01:29.850> so<00:01:30.600> you

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
the pink line on the graph is rpm so you

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.779 
the pink line on the graph is rpm so you
can<00:01:30.840> see<00:01:31.049> we're<00:01:31.200> picking<00:01:31.530> up<00:01:31.619> three<00:01:32.069> gears

00:01:32.779 --> 00:01:32.789 
can see we're picking up three gears

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:35.419 
can see we're picking up three gears
here<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.869> last<00:01:34.079> one<00:01:34.380> being<00:01:34.560> overdrive<00:01:35.069> that's

00:01:35.419 --> 00:01:35.429 
here the last one being overdrive that's

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:36.199 
here the last one being overdrive that's
what<00:01:35.609> we're<00:01:35.729> going<00:01:35.819> to<00:01:35.880> look<00:01:36.000> at<00:01:36.149> our

00:01:36.199 --> 00:01:36.209 
what we're going to look at our

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:39.249 
what we're going to look at our
horsepower<00:01:36.780> so<00:01:37.619> if<00:01:37.679> we<00:01:37.799> click<00:01:37.979> on<00:01:38.219> this<00:01:38.429> graph

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
horsepower so if we click on this graph

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:44.660 
horsepower so if we click on this graph
that<00:01:40.259> gives<00:01:40.469> us<00:01:40.649> 279<00:01:41.490> horsepower<00:01:43.670> 543

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
that gives us 279 horsepower 543

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.050 
that gives us 279 horsepower 543
foot-pounds<00:01:45.539> of<00:01:45.599> torque<00:01:46.429> 543<00:01:47.429> foot-pounds<00:01:48.000> of

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.539 
foot-pounds of torque 543 foot-pounds of
torque<00:01:48.119> that's<00:01:48.750> correct<00:01:49.110> okay<00:01:49.319> so<00:01:49.590> with<00:01:50.399> our

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
torque that's correct okay so with our

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.910 
torque that's correct okay so with our
power<00:01:50.789> pup<00:01:51.060> downloader<00:01:51.539> let's<00:01:52.349> put<00:01:52.530> this<00:01:52.679> on

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920

00:01:52.920 --> 00:02:06.940 
power pup downloader let's put this on
and<00:01:53.189> see<00:01:53.429> how<00:01:53.459> much<00:01:53.700> we<00:01:53.849> pick<00:01:54.060> up

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.120

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
now that the downloads on let's see what

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:19.729 
now that the downloads on let's see what
this<00:02:11.280> truck<00:02:11.550> has<00:02:17.209> Wow<00:02:18.209> the<00:02:19.050> truck<00:02:19.290> sounded<00:02:19.709> a

this truck has Wow the truck sounded a
lot<00:02:19.860> better<00:02:19.920> let's<00:02:20.520> take<00:02:20.670> a<00:02:20.730> look<00:02:20.880> at<00:02:20.970> the

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
lot better let's take a look at the

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.080 
lot better let's take a look at the
