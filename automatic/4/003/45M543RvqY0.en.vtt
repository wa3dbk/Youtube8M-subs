Hey guys this is Eddie aka bulletproof
monk.  Welcome to the first lesson of

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:16.550
actually learning Chinese properly or
Mandarin so what we want to do first is

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:23.880
give you guys the tool to be able to
type Chinese on the screen now you might

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:31.009
say dude I'm only here to learn the
basics I only want to say how are you or

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:36.930
what's your name or how do I get to the
airport if that's what you're looking

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.460
for then there's probably a million
other YouTube videos where you can learn

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:48.420
to do that so to make sure that you guys
are committed I'm gonna get you guys to

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:55.140
setup the writing system on your
computer straight away so that you guys

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.730
can start typing in Chinese and
therefore at the same time we can learn

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:07.409
to write to speak to listen to read all
at the same time and that's what we want

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.820
to do so this is for people who
seriously want to start learning some

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:20.090
Chinese so okay the first step is we're
going to go to the control panel so

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:26.369
obviously this is assuming that you have
Windows just type it up here so I'm just

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:37.560
gonna type in languages so Region and
Language so if you click on change

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:45.479
keyboards or other input methods that's
the one you got to click on in order to

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.659
add a new input method to be able to
type in Chinese on your computer so we

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:58.409
click that and then you can see there's
four tabs up here and we're gonna click

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.479
on the one that says keyboards and
languages and then we're gonna click on

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:10.020
change keyboards this is what it should
look like for you because right now the

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.110
only thing you're typing on your
computer is English

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:20.460
unless you have five other languages or
something so click Add and then you can

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.990
see here there's all of these languages
that you can type on your computer how

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:33.810
cool is that now I want you to look for
Chinese simplified PRC this one here now

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:41.400
PRC stands for People's Republic of
China which is like China's full name so

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:50.130
you click that and then you click on the
plus button next to keyboard and then

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:57.150
what we want is the second one which
says Microsoft Pinyin new experience

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:05.850
input so just click that one the second
one alright new experience it sounds

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:15.360
better anyway so click OK click OK click
OK and we're going to close down the

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:25.590
control panel and now I want you guys to
open up notepad so just make your font a

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:33.900
bit bigger in notepad so it's slightly
bigger and to test out your new input

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:41.239
method on the bottom right hand corner
click on the English icon and choose

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:51.630
chinese Simplified now you'll see all
these different icons on the bottom

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:57.870
right-hand corner and we'll discuss what
they mean later on but right now if you

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:07.470
click on the screen and you type
something for example ma now straight

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:13.830
away you can see that there is some
words to choose from on the screen now

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:21.720
these are all different Chinese words
pronounced the same way as ma and if you

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:27.110
choose the number one character ma

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.939
and press Enter
you have just typed your first Chinese

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:40.150
character on the screen and now you
might say hang on how do I go back to

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:46.120
typing in English if you go back down on
the bottom right hand corner and switch

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:55.539
this back to English now I'm just going
to type horse and that's what this

00:04:55.539 --> 00:05:08.860
character means horse and ma refers to
the horse so this concludes the first

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:16.150
lesson on Chinese from this lesson you
should have learnt how to type Chinese

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:22.569
if you have an apple or something like
that I don't know what operating system

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:34.050
you use just look up on YouTube a
tutorial for ping in input method

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:39.009
because that's what you want to setup on
your computer so that you can enter

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:43.479
Chinese on your computer and I look
forward to seeing you in the next lesson

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:48.120
where we're going to do a bit more
Chinese.
