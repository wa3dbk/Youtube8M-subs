00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.869
 long awaited by you which is like the 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:23.510
 Pan 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.520
 how to position yourself on the board and how 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.860
 to lift what I am in a position of 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.770
 Roman ramada 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:36.290
 I want focus where you can go wrong 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:37.250
 here is this the time to raise the 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.850
 board 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:44.899
 You can put your hand here on the edge. 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:48.140
 to raise this here was you can 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:49.970
 lose your balance because you can 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.149
 be coming back a little more force 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:55.250
 this and that side and losing is that 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:57.680
 it's time to get up 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.660
 You have to put your hand next to your foot. 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.559
 as if it were a reflection to overcome the 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.280
 palm 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:06.710
 You have to do this here on the side of the 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.759
 Your chest to lift the beach is 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.369
 first thing 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:12.229
 The second step is to get up 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.270
 surfboard broke off the board 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.580
 you see that you get up all at once 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.280
 You can too if you do not 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.049
 getting up all at once is going to make you bad 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.330
 will lose the balance is the chance of 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:24.560
 you get the pair is too small and 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.790
 explain why you're going first. 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:31.490
 stand up straight, right? 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:35.119
 one got up if you put the 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.860
 knee here to drop to get 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.900
 getting up will lose your balance 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.630
 What are you going to do? 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.640
 european anti-drug movement just can not 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.960
 have two together you will not miss the 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.259
 balance, you will want to do this 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:52.640
 here yesterday the knee and then I will 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:54.740
 Wanna get up to surf on this one? 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:59.299
 want to make believe that this is wrong 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.740
 will lose balance and the surfboard will wash 

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:03.170
 exchange work you will be 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.570
 voting your whole body forward you 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.860
 You have to do this at once to 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.959
 not lose the balance followed a 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.690
 movement you can miss is the 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:14.819
 next lifted off the board 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:20.190
 and you that the girl can put the two 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:21.930
 knees so to raise up to you do 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.760
 This is where you already fell. 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:29.190
 you lose your balance you want 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:32.940
 get up and look where you got to 6 45 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:35.250
 movements 160 is shallow 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.290
 you will fall you will lose your balance 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.000
 it lasted only one movement is to teach for 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:44.459
 you and the right time 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:49.080
 Summarizing, I want to raise the wave. 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:51.090
 that I'm going to flex and then I eat 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.600
 screen will already be 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:59.150
 positioned how do you kick the pec 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.150
 from Kardec or here 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.900
 I'll press him to lift the 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.989
 my whole body 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.720
 I will do my arm strength along with the 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:13.440
 arms and ate like forever back there to 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.370
 Can I get my second foot imposed? 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:24.390
 on the board 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:28.130
 understood then bind up lifting 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:31.620
 just for that foot to stay 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:36.420
 positioned on the board and I got 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:38.130
 raise understood that he filled a position 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.160
 of paddling 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:45.090
 while raising this pec 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:49.110
 behind you kick and it will already be 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:54.230
 positioned for you to stand up then 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:54.230
 You made a mistake, you 're here. 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:04.079
 the foot there behind is automatic 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:07.069
 they a lot when you boot here too 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:09.329
 the first tranche wants to climb on the board 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:12.180
 it's long 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:15.120
 climb is practical and to get up it 's just you 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:19.229
 force together with the arm and with this 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:23.940
 p q's there on the deck you will raise a 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:27.440
 front and in the same movement 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:33.810
 the same movement as you lifted 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:36.150
 This foot here has passed through you. 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:39.300
 raise while flexing 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:41.910
 your foot will automatically be there in the 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.520
 deck for you to raise and this should 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.990
 go inside to give you support and 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.560
 you get pa 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.560
 so it 's essential 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.910
 This is the drug move now to 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.780
 you can balance much better 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.229
 still 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:10.580
 then the wave his arms and 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:12.759
 flex the knee so I 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:16.360
 I 'm going to continue the process. 

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:16.360
 and another clan 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:26.710
 drop would elongate yesterday that is cutting 

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:29.139
 my foot right in the middle to long or it here 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:31.330
 that's the basis she has to be 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:34.569
 comfortable in london is a may be 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:36.220
 far ahead of the board and not much 

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:38.349
 under the plank she has to be 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.720
 in a comfortable position in the distance 

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:45.069
 a step more or less than its base 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:47.440
 knee slightly bent white 

00:05:45.069 --> 00:05:49.810
 again charged just to give you more 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:55.409
 balance I'll summarize here all 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:55.409
 I made up to here is a rumor again 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:06.810
 a position held in the position of nothing 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:09.250
 I want to prove how to flex 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:10.659
 my foot is not automatically 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:14.020
 working well 

00:06:10.659 --> 00:06:15.400
 I want to get up I'm going to use the strength of 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:18.699
 my foot with my hand to 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:23.610
 get up and I'll put the other one in position 

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:23.610
 of the base with money 

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:38.400
 the flexed child is well positioned 

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:41.080
 Based well positioned right hand positioned 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:44.650
 attention forward 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:47.740
 looking forward positioned well what 

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:49.780
 now just practice and keep doing 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:50.889
 this many times you go 

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:54.370
 get well 

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:56.169
