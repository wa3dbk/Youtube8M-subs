00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:04.179
 Y 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:12.320
 hello my name is daniela finger food 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:15.049
 I'm the one who I work at Metz 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:19.240
 6 years ago already and for 2 years that 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:23.410
 I'm working with tomÃ¡s gonzÃ¡lez 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:25.570
 in a particular way with the accompanied 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.849
 travel and I see it almost every day 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:31.060
 here in santiago also to give 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:33.070
 treatment and now we are already in the 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.530
 last process before the games 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.710
 Olympians because of his condition as an athlete 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:41.170
 I had to be already but like sports 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.710
 gives you a chance a championship and 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:47.370
 everything so much you never know how 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:49.199
 as it has happened but the attending his 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.329
 history had to be there then 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:52.470
 it was the happiness of having arrived at 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.780
 objective because he had been 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.510
 working hard hard hard respectful 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.600
 to pass an Olympic final on the ground is 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.220
 high ideal savior and once inside 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.320
 the final already as that happens to be another 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.570
 story and if you can get there I do 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.119
 a medal that is also everything is 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.500
 possible as it is practical ideal as 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.710
 We have always set objectives for 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.890
 little bit first then move on to 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:20.310
 final and then think of others positive 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.640
 more good next Friday the 13th we're going 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.200
 to madrid a week to acclimatize a 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.800
 little value everything and there we travel the 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:32.070
 21 to london the olympic game and the 28 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.539
 is the male classification and hence 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.190
 they start every day of competition from 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:37.050
 with women and so end by team up 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.820
 the day 7 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.900
 I'm going to do only sun and jump, I'll 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.870
 privilege my strongest device 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:47.030
 so neither wear is going to be 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:50.510
 as much as making all six devices but 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.520
 but if the whole existence that I put on 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.830
 in these two speaks everything is the greatest 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.110
 skiing within the eight best of the 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.190
 world which is very feasible with the 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.420
 difficulty that I have and because I am 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.220
 finalist last year and now they are going to 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.810
 be the same and ours and is 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.700
 impossible that it is in a final but 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.070
 for that you have to leave everything in the day 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:11.570
 28 ago 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:12.860
 two weeks approximately had a 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.990
 injury an inflammation of the 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.240
 joint that goes between the clavicle and 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.880
 the sternum probably by a 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.980
 overload of some movements 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.110
 brusque fall on the shoulders the 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.300
 Parallel rings works a long time 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.790
 de cristo 'of strength that are movements 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.590
 that tension of that area was generated 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.200
 it generated there is a strong inflammation 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.910
 we were in months we were reviewing 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.740
 doctor motte and what with art helps 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.819
 of the being executioner I recently had a 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.849
 synovitis 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:43.859
 stern or calculate so a fortiori 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:46.349
 I have to take care of myself and privilege 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:48.150
 startled the ideal for any 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:50.939
 information obviously rest I do not 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.230
 I can stop so with daniela genio 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:54.780
 that you have only that we're working 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.819
 every day I was almost two weeks 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.340
 morning and evening with kinesiology with 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.889
 sessions and now they have already moved to one and 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.150
 I feel much better but there it is but 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:05.129
 it is impossible not to have any type 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.770
 discomfort so we try to maintain 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:09.770
 the best possible 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:13.550
 the articulation my work is 90 by 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:15.800
 a hundred more but what what is 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.210
 over time what I can 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.040
 I will contribute with the others 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.810
 athletes also send a greeting 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.880
 to all the metz people and I love them 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.660
 thank you for supporting me forever 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.780
 germ 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.460
 he had tried that the frequent ones for 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.500
 weeks and 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:33.630
 and that I hope it's a lot of sport 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.310
 thanks suddenly I do not even think 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.080
 I think I'm going to some Olympic games 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.340
 then nervous, this is not super 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.950
 quiet if it was quiet with the 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:44.790
 Thomas work work is 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:47.100
 this cable then that's not no I think 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:50.420
 which is more like the desire to get the 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.420
 I want to be there 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.989
