00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.140
 if you all have kids come to this 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.320
 new video I'm here today to introduce you 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:23.259
 this manure spreader deduce tridem of 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:27.730
 between belen and mobbing practically 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:30.640
 they would be hilux farms in another group 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:34.000
 have gathered have redone a little 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.220
 let's say the staff and you know how to make it short 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.900
 they are always them 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:44.290
 this three-axle manure spreader comes from the 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:46.840
 old tandem of the old one for 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:50.140
 blue and if you remember 2013 those 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:52.750
 three boards two boards that had come out a lot 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.930
 beautiful this is practically in the 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:58.989
 false line and the model is the same as the 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:03.070
 brand is the same color is everything 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:05.350
 so let's say he's a brother of those 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:09.700
 wagons there as a model is enough 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:12.690
 excellent always a little sin 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.590
 textures have never been great 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:19.569
 textured we laugh so we can 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:21.729
 call them you are nice though one 

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:23.590
 textures could improve a little 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:26.800
 But we look at the side of the same things 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:31.179
 positive that graphically do not have a 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:33.819
 great weight as functionality one is one 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:36.880
 very simple manure spreader has nothing 

00:01:33.819 --> 00:01:39.250
 which however I said the model is 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.259
 good to invasion on the chains at 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.440
 animations behind on the copies and then 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:46.989
 we will still try it and bastad has 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:50.200
 let's see let's operate the foot of 

00:01:46.989 --> 00:01:51.620
 parking we have the wedges back here 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.760
 those for 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:58.070
 the retainer the firm wheel that's enough for 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.600
 there is nothing else there is the dirt 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:05.420
 which is quite marked so great 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.860
 then the flashing lights are on 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.880
 however we're going to see it all in 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:13.880
 enough action as weight is enough 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.040
 I tell you heavy with the 72 50 which 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.900
 I struggle to pull it full 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.960
 also because it holds 32,000 then 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.780
 quite enough let's say big and 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:27.620
 15 I recommend the cavalleri is 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:30.200
 quite lending other possibilities 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.130
 there is the possibility of opening the banks 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:37.520
 side that we are going to see immediately 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:42.460
 here it is that facilitate virtually 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.460
 the load here it is 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:49.990
 ok we charge that so then we go 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:52.880
 to see immediately at work 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:54.680
 the pile which I did with the placebo 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.870
 lips and that I had presented 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.870
 if you want to know 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.280
 here 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.280
 always all dynamic of course 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.480
 I decided to present it because 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:40.580
 however they had life is a new medium 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.709
 yes something new also because 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:46.819
 as you will always see the usual speech 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:49.370
 that come out erice is of a larsal age so 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:51.980
 we say from scratch we are practically a 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:56.420
 cards because it is not does not come out does not come out 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:59.540
 nothing and therefore decided to do it must 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.849
 however we change a little well loaded air 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.500
 see you praying for a moment 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:07.450
 very little 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.450
 here we are, we did the full 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:14.150
 capacity networks and 32,000 heard that 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.820
 weighs a lot 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:20.060
 there is a first light in place ok arrows 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:25.840
 headlights in place there also we have a 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:30.400
 flashing fall the rear lights 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.400
 see these seductive here 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.069
 just 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:45.170
 I put automatic would like 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:48.170
 the animation you saw the spondine here 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:50.540
 who gets up and this one too 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:55.580
 obviously the door to do to do 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:05:00.020
 go out the manure I think you see 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:06.530
 cochlee there that run so much to do it to you 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:09.430
 see they work so here it is but never 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.430
 at the point it runs 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:17.059
 or will close pine sorbet 

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:17.059
 I'm Maremma Maiala 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:30.050
 failure width is about 15 meters 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:38.460
 which we do so but which are there 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:43.080
 augers the animated chains something a little 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:45.600
 cota you see it even better as time 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:51.240
 pretty good emptying isn't 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:54.650
 too high nor too low then ok the 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.650
 partico the back is in place 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:05:59.409
 a medium 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:11.070
 and just nothing I said before is the dirt 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:13.680
 it gets dirty even quite large zoo is 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:18.630
 virtually unrecognizable stuff 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:21.750
 crazy and just guys i with this 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:23.910
 I leave you hope I was clear 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:27.780
 on presentation and where there is nothing 

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:31.530
 let's say phenomenal to understand 

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:36.270
 still a nice half a nice 3 0 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:38.610
 news now we always wait for it to come out 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:42.120
 something somehow truly worthy of 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:45.060
 a bit of note because by now certain reduced 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:49.289
 to present yourself or not always the same 

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:51.930
 things and I leave you I leave you 

00:06:49.289 --> 00:06:53.820
 obviously the link description and there 

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:56.479
