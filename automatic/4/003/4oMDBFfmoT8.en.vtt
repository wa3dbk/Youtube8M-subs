they're just mounted the camera box what
do<00:02:53.300> you<00:02:53.360> think<00:02:53.510> about<00:02:53.600> this<00:02:53.870> here<00:02:55.180> it's<00:02:56.180> gonna

do you think about this here it's gonna
go<00:02:56.450> right<00:02:56.600> in<00:02:56.780> there<00:02:56.930> this<00:02:57.680> will<00:02:57.830> protect<00:02:58.010> it

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
go right in there this will protect it

go right in there this will protect it
from<00:02:58.370> the<00:02:58.520> shop<00:02:58.700> I<00:02:58.880> met<00:02:59.060> Lance

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
so what do you just put styrofoam of

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.430 
so what do you just put styrofoam of
duct<00:03:06.160> tape<00:03:06.190> together<00:03:06.580> no<00:03:07.540> actually<00:03:08.110> this<00:03:08.230> is<00:03:08.410> a

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
duct tape together no actually this is a

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.000 
duct tape together no actually this is a
styrofoam<00:03:09.040> and<00:03:09.280> carbon-fiber<00:03:10.239> mesh<00:03:10.920> over<00:03:11.920> the

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
styrofoam and carbon-fiber mesh over the

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.180 
styrofoam and carbon-fiber mesh over the
styrofoam<00:03:12.879> to<00:03:13.569> make<00:03:13.720> a<00:03:13.750> strong<00:03:14.080> platform<00:03:14.349> we

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
styrofoam to make a strong platform we

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.520 
styrofoam to make a strong platform we
just<00:03:15.400> zip<00:03:16.030> tied<00:03:16.269> it<00:03:16.420> to<00:03:16.599> these<00:03:16.780> carbon-fiber

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
just zip tied it to these carbon-fiber

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.530 
just zip tied it to these carbon-fiber
poles<00:03:17.830> here<00:03:18.129> we<00:03:18.519> got<00:03:18.670> Monte<00:03:19.000> Internet<00:03:19.300> for<00:03:19.510> a

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
poles here we got Monte Internet for a

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.020 
poles here we got Monte Internet for a
dollar<00:03:19.720> piece<00:03:20.250> we're<00:03:21.250> just<00:03:21.430> forming<00:03:21.819> them<00:03:21.849> in

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
dollar piece we're just forming them in

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.150 
dollar piece we're just forming them in
the<00:03:22.330> triangles<00:03:22.900> so<00:03:23.230> that<00:03:23.380> we<00:03:23.680> have<00:03:23.830> a<00:03:23.860> nice

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
the triangles so that we have a nice

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.740 
the triangles so that we have a nice
strong<00:03:24.580> frame<00:03:25.420> for<00:03:25.750> our<00:03:25.840> unit<00:03:27.510> yeah<00:03:28.510> this

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
strong frame for our unit yeah this

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.449 
strong frame for our unit yeah this
these<00:03:29.049> switches<00:03:29.410> control<00:03:29.590> the<00:03:29.860> heat<00:03:30.010> pads<00:03:30.250> up

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
these switches control the heat pads up

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.280 
these switches control the heat pads up
here<00:03:30.700> and<00:03:31.540> they're<00:03:31.630> gonna<00:03:31.690> heat<00:03:31.959> up<00:03:31.989> the

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
here and they're gonna heat up the

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.680 
here and they're gonna heat up the
laptop<00:03:32.709> when<00:03:33.099> it<00:03:33.129> gets<00:03:33.340> real<00:03:33.519> cold<00:03:33.730> so<00:03:34.090> I'm

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
laptop when it gets real cold so I'm

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.350 
laptop when it gets real cold so I'm
just<00:03:34.900> putting<00:03:35.769> this<00:03:35.950> GPS<00:03:36.489> into<00:03:36.760> this<00:03:36.940> box<00:03:37.180> here

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
just putting this GPS into this box here

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.690 
just putting this GPS into this box here
this<00:03:37.840> is<00:03:37.989> gonna<00:03:38.140> tell<00:03:38.410> us<00:03:38.470> where<00:03:38.980> it<00:03:39.130> is<00:03:39.250> when

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
this is gonna tell us where it is when

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.839 
this is gonna tell us where it is when
it<00:03:39.790> lands<00:03:40.239> and<00:03:41.040> it's<00:03:42.040> gonna<00:03:42.190> send<00:03:42.400> us<00:03:42.489> email

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:42.849 
it lands and it's gonna send us email

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:44.309 
it lands and it's gonna send us email
with<00:03:42.970> the<00:03:43.060> coordinates<00:03:43.420> each<00:03:43.959> one<00:03:44.170> of<00:03:44.260> these

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:44.319 
with the coordinates each one of these

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:46.740 
with the coordinates each one of these
little<00:03:44.530> green<00:03:44.680> lines<00:03:44.950> here<00:03:45.120> is<00:03:46.120> represented

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
little green lines here is represented

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.470 
little green lines here is represented
by<00:03:46.780> this<00:03:46.930> box<00:03:47.349> up<00:03:47.620> here<00:03:47.799> and<00:03:48.640> it<00:03:49.150> lets<00:03:49.329> us<00:03:49.420> know

by this box up here and it lets us know

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.539 
by this box up here and it lets us know
the<00:03:49.720> altitude<00:03:50.200> and<00:03:50.410> the<00:03:50.500> GPS<00:03:50.920> coordinates<00:03:51.220> of

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
the altitude and the GPS coordinates of

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:53.100 
the altitude and the GPS coordinates of
where<00:03:51.700> this<00:03:51.910> is<00:03:52.030> flying<00:03:52.299> so<00:03:52.870> what<00:03:52.989> are<00:03:53.049> you

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
where this is flying so what are you

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:54.990 
where this is flying so what are you
doing<00:03:53.290> that<00:03:53.440> crap<00:03:53.650> I'm<00:03:54.340> just<00:03:54.640> checking<00:03:54.849> the

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
doing that crap I'm just checking the

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.210 
doing that crap I'm just checking the
GPS<00:03:55.420> and<00:03:55.660> satellite<00:03:55.989> up<00:03:56.349> we<00:03:56.500> could<00:03:56.920> find<00:03:57.130> this

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
GPS and satellite up we could find this

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.100 
GPS and satellite up we could find this
thing<00:03:57.400> when<00:03:57.579> it<00:03:57.700> lands<00:03:58.000> it's<00:03:58.569> not<00:03:58.690> lost<00:03:58.930> out

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
thing when it lands it's not lost out

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.610 
thing when it lands it's not lost out
the<00:03:59.230> middle<00:03:59.410> of<00:03:59.470> nowhere<00:03:59.590> so<00:04:01.410> all<00:04:02.410> right<00:04:02.500> those

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
the middle of nowhere so all right those

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
that the parachute awesome yeah this is

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:19.070 
that the parachute awesome yeah this is
a<00:04:17.760> pair<00:04:18.030> of<00:04:18.060> shoe<00:04:18.299> there's<00:04:18.540> some<00:04:18.660> holes<00:04:18.840> in<00:04:18.989> the

a pair of shoe there's some holes in the

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.360 
a pair of shoe there's some holes in the
bottom<00:04:19.290> here<00:04:19.470> so<00:04:19.620> once<00:04:19.769> we<00:04:19.890> get<00:04:20.010> back<00:04:20.160> in<00:04:20.340> the

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
bottom here so once we get back in the

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.580 
bottom here so once we get back in the
atmosphere<00:04:20.580> it<00:04:21.150> just<00:04:21.360> deploys<00:04:21.870> automatically

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
atmosphere it just deploys automatically

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.110

so<00:04:22.800> that<00:04:22.920> our<00:04:23.070> laptop<00:04:23.490> doesn't<00:04:23.760> hit<00:04:24.000> the

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
so that our laptop doesn't hit the

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.140 
so that our laptop doesn't hit the
ground<00:04:24.330> at<00:04:24.480> Mach<00:04:24.660> 1<00:04:25.610> so<00:04:26.610> I<00:04:26.640> think<00:04:26.730> we're<00:04:27.000> pretty

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
ground at Mach 1 so I think we're pretty

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.180 
ground at Mach 1 so I think we're pretty
much<00:04:27.330> done<00:04:27.870> once<00:04:28.260> Jim<00:04:28.500> gets<00:04:28.680> the<00:04:28.800> dog<00:04:28.950> in<00:04:29.100> the

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
much done once Jim gets the dog in the

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:30.560 
much done once Jim gets the dog in the
car<00:04:29.220> we<00:04:29.550> can<00:04:29.580> get<00:04:30.000> ready<00:04:30.150> to<00:04:30.270> launch<00:04:30.420> this

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
car we can get ready to launch this

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:33.440
