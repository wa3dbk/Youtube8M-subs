00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:36.850 
line level outputs on the back as well

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.819 
line level outputs on the back as well
we've<00:00:37.780> got<00:00:37.929> a<00:00:37.960> headphone<00:00:38.260> output<00:00:38.649> on<00:00:38.739> the

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:38.829 
we've got a headphone output on the

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:40.349 
we've got a headphone output on the

00:00:40.349 --> 00:00:40.359 
front which has its own volume control

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:42.149 
front which has its own volume control
and<00:00:40.600> the<00:00:40.929> interface<00:00:41.199> is<00:00:41.379> setup<00:00:41.649> with<00:00:41.769> direct

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:42.159 
and the interface is setup with direct

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:43.649 
and the interface is setup with direct
monitoring<00:00:42.579> so<00:00:42.699> there's<00:00:42.850> no<00:00:42.969> latency<00:00:43.390> issues

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:43.659 
monitoring so there's no latency issues

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:45.119 
monitoring so there's no latency issues
when<00:00:43.809> you're<00:00:43.929> recording<00:00:44.230> the<00:00:44.679> interface<00:00:44.980> has

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:45.129 
when you're recording the interface has

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:47.069 
when you're recording the interface has
48<00:00:45.550> volt<00:00:45.760> phantom<00:00:45.999> power<00:00:46.120> it<00:00:46.719> does<00:00:46.839> require

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:47.079 
48 volt phantom power it does require

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:48.779 
48 volt phantom power it does require
that<00:00:47.199> you<00:00:47.319> connected<00:00:47.739> to<00:00:47.800> a<00:00:47.920> USB<00:00:48.370> power<00:00:48.550> supply

00:00:48.779 --> 00:00:48.789 
that you connected to a USB power supply

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:49.919 
that you connected to a USB power supply
when<00:00:49.120> you're<00:00:49.239> using<00:00:49.390> it<00:00:49.569> that<00:00:49.690> can<00:00:49.839> be

00:00:49.919 --> 00:00:49.929 
when you're using it that can be

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:51.840 
when you're using it that can be
something<00:00:50.109> like<00:00:50.319> an<00:00:50.440> iPhone<00:00:50.559> power<00:00:51.039> supply<00:00:51.399> or

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
something like an iPhone power supply or

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.160 
something like an iPhone power supply or
you<00:00:51.969> can<00:00:52.120> power<00:00:52.300> it<00:00:52.359> by<00:00:52.510> bus<00:00:52.719> power<00:00:52.929> off<00:00:53.140> your

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170
