although<00:02:21.629> I<00:02:21.870> do<00:02:21.989> have<00:02:22.170> to<00:02:22.260> mention<00:02:22.530> that

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
although I do have to mention that

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.680 
although I do have to mention that
particularly<00:02:23.580> like<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:23.820> massive<00:02:24.150> icons

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
particularly like the massive icons

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.200 
particularly like the massive icons
again<00:02:25.470> thankfully<00:02:25.770> this<00:02:26.070> is<00:02:26.220> Android<00:02:26.610> now

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
again thankfully this is Android now

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:28.490 
again thankfully this is Android now
this<00:02:27.360> could<00:02:27.480> easily<00:02:27.660> be<00:02:27.870> changed<00:02:28.020> with<00:02:28.470> a

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
this could easily be changed with a

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.230 
this could easily be changed with a
different<00:02:28.860> launcher<00:02:28.980> but<00:02:29.760> apart<00:02:30.030> from<00:02:30.060> the

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
different launcher but apart from the

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.050 
different launcher but apart from the
icons<00:02:30.600> I<00:02:30.930> like<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.380> operating<00:02:31.740> system<00:02:32.130> and<00:02:32.310> it

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
icons I like the operating system and it

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.940 
icons I like the operating system and it
looks<00:02:33.240> cleaner<00:02:33.570> and<00:02:33.930> it<00:02:34.020> runs<00:02:34.170> smoother<00:02:34.650> so

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
looks cleaner and it runs smoother so

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.590 
looks cleaner and it runs smoother so
overall<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.580> operating<00:02:35.970> system<00:02:36.270> is<00:02:36.420> pretty

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
overall the operating system is pretty

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.740 
overall the operating system is pretty
amazing<00:02:36.930> in<00:02:37.800> terms<00:02:38.460> of<00:02:38.790> size<00:02:39.000> the<00:02:39.240> Nexus<00:02:39.540> 5<00:02:39.720> is

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
amazing in terms of size the Nexus 5 is

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.510 
amazing in terms of size the Nexus 5 is
slightly<00:02:40.110> bigger<00:02:40.380> than<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.710> nexus<00:02:40.980> 4<00:02:41.280> and

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
slightly bigger than the nexus 4 and

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.430 
slightly bigger than the nexus 4 and
it's<00:02:41.970> considerably<00:02:42.480> larger<00:02:42.900> than<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.140> iphone

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
it's considerably larger than the iphone

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.350 
it's considerably larger than the iphone
5s<00:02:43.860> so<00:02:44.520> if<00:02:44.610> you're<00:02:44.700> coming<00:02:44.880> from<00:02:45.090> an<00:02:45.240> iphone

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
5s so if you're coming from an iphone

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.700 
5s so if you're coming from an iphone
it's<00:02:45.840> going<00:02:45.960> to<00:02:46.020> take<00:02:46.170> a<00:02:46.200> while<00:02:46.290> before<00:02:46.530> you

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
it's going to take a while before you

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.950 
it's going to take a while before you
get<00:02:46.950> used<00:02:47.100> to<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.280> Nexus<00:02:47.610> 5<00:02:47.820> but<00:02:48.570> coming<00:02:48.780> from

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
get used to the Nexus 5 but coming from

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.690 
get used to the Nexus 5 but coming from
a<00:02:49.080> nexus<00:02:49.380> 4<00:02:49.650> you<00:02:49.980> will<00:02:50.010> feel<00:02:50.310> right<00:02:50.490> at<00:02:50.550> home

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
a nexus 4 you will feel right at home

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.300 
a nexus 4 you will feel right at home
relatively<00:02:51.300> quick<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:52.620> battery<00:02:52.950> life<00:02:53.070> in<00:02:53.220> the

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
relatively quick the battery life in the

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.140 
relatively quick the battery life in the
Nexus<00:02:53.610> 5<00:02:53.850> is<00:02:54.290> okay<00:02:55.290> but<00:02:55.680> it's<00:02:55.830> not<00:02:55.920> great<00:02:56.370> it

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
Nexus 5 is okay but it's not great it

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.840 
Nexus 5 is okay but it's not great it
can<00:02:57.750> average<00:02:58.020> around<00:02:58.680> three<00:02:59.160> hours<00:02:59.190> of<00:02:59.670> on

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
can average around three hours of on

can average around three hours of on
screen<00:03:00.150> on<00:03:00.330> time<00:03:00.540> and<00:03:00.870> that's<00:03:01.380> not<00:03:01.860> too<00:03:02.220> good

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
screen on time and that's not too good

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.760 
screen on time and that's not too good
so<00:03:03.150> in<00:03:03.270> order<00:03:03.390> to<00:03:03.570> get<00:03:03.720> more<00:03:03.990> time<00:03:04.320> out<00:03:04.560> of<00:03:04.680> the

so in order to get more time out of the

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.260 
so in order to get more time out of the
battery<00:03:05.100> I<00:03:05.400> started<00:03:05.820> playing<00:03:05.970> around<00:03:06.150> with

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
battery I started playing around with

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:07.790 
battery I started playing around with
some<00:03:06.390> of<00:03:06.660> the<00:03:06.720> settings<00:03:06.930> and<00:03:07.260> I<00:03:07.350> was<00:03:07.470> able<00:03:07.620> to

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
some of the settings and I was able to

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.830 
some of the settings and I was able to
get<00:03:07.920> around<00:03:08.040> five<00:03:08.520> hours<00:03:08.550> of<00:03:09.120> screen<00:03:09.390> on<00:03:09.570> time

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
get around five hours of screen on time

get around five hours of screen on time
one<00:03:10.440> of<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:10.620> ways<00:03:10.740> that<00:03:10.920> i<00:03:10.980> was<00:03:11.130> able<00:03:11.160> to<00:03:11.430> do

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
one of the ways that i was able to do

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.810 
one of the ways that i was able to do
that<00:03:11.790> is<00:03:12.030> by<00:03:12.240> turning<00:03:12.540> off<00:03:12.720> google<00:03:13.260> now<00:03:13.470> or

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
that is by turning off google now or

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.460 
that is by turning off google now or
turning<00:03:14.820> off<00:03:14.970> speech<00:03:15.600> input<00:03:15.840> in<00:03:16.230> the<00:03:16.320> home

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
turning off speech input in the home

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.800 
turning off speech input in the home
screen<00:03:16.800> and<00:03:16.920> kill<00:03:17.580> location<00:03:18.090> services<00:03:18.600> or

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
lower the accuracy of the location

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.570 
lower the accuracy of the location
services<00:03:21.300> and<00:03:21.510> kill<00:03:22.110> NFC<00:03:22.650> all<00:03:22.860> together<00:03:23.130> and

services and kill NFC all together and

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.460 
services and kill NFC all together and
that's<00:03:24.210> how<00:03:24.360> I<00:03:24.390> was<00:03:24.750> able<00:03:24.810> to<00:03:25.140> get<00:03:25.350> around

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
that's how I was able to get around

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.230 
that's how I was able to get around
