00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:10.830
 Hello, I 'm Melissa Setúbal and I 'm 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.179
 People are going to make a candy recipe. 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.179
 linseed proteins 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:24.800
 for that we will not even use the cup 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:28.279
 Whole flaxseed a 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:31.279
 cup of raw half cashew nuts 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:34.129
 teaspoon ground cinnamon powder 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.050
 teaspoon ginger powder one 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:41.210
 teaspoon vanilla extract 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:44.120
 natural one cup of pasta 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.430
 sesame to give alloy 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.890
 this recipe we will use seeds 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.410
 to make our own 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:54.559
 own flour so we 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.899
 still benefits of omega 3 which is 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:00.519
 antioxidant properties than flour 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:00.519
 of this market has no 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.850
 For this we will put sock 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:14.210
 cup of flaxseed to hit the 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:19.250
 blender to make the flour and 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:20.690
 will beat pulsing until you can flour 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.800
 you can shake the blender 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.800
 Meanwhile 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:34.750
 if you need you can stop 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:40.170
 scrape the sides, especially the 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.170
 background and hit some more 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:52.190
 and so we have the wand 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.190
 linseed 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.369
 now we will put the chestnut 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:04.630
 cashew to grind in the hour to 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:04.630
 maintain their properties 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:16.010
 and now it's going to be the turn to put everything in 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.280
 bowl 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:22.340
 We'll start with stocking 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:26.030
 cup of flax flour 1 cup 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:33.010
 of cinnamon cashew flour in 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:37.810
 powder half a teaspoon ginger powder 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.810
 a teaspoon of vanilla extract 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:47.570
 the cameras that so seedless and we 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:51.380
 will use sesame paste or tahiri né 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:54.019
 which is the same as the Arabic name already starting 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.180
 with two tablespoons and we'll go 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:57.890
 gradually adding 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.480
 to be able to get the league that 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.790
 people are looking for or can get 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.650
 roll the sweets with all 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.970
 ingredients in the bowl we'll pick up 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.970
 a hand mix 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.200
 when it gets difficult for mixer to continue 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.870
 beating and means that we have to 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.200
 put a little more paste 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.200
 Sesame 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:35.129
 Ok, we'll get better some more. 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:39.190
 although with a hard tone but I go well 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:40.720
 So when you realize you give this 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:45.880
 turns on 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:48.730
 We can roll the sweets already. 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:56.410
 how do we bring a brigadeiro and will 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:04:00.120
 take a portion roll with name and so 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.120
 We have a candle protagonist.
