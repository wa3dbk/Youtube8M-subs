one<00:01:26.659> bringing<00:01:28.130> basically<00:01:29.130> matches<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:31.310> wood

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
one bringing basically matches and wood

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.039 
one bringing basically matches and wood
glue<00:01:33.380> and<00:01:34.380> you're<00:01:35.100> going<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.479> measure<00:01:36.479> some

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
glue and you're going to measure some

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.249 
glue and you're going to measure some
some<00:01:37.470> matches<00:01:37.860> in<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.130> size<00:01:38.400> of<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.700> hole<00:01:39.259> try

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
some matches in the size of the hole try

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.770 
some matches in the size of the hole try
to<00:01:40.320> figure<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.130> out<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.369> way<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.790> stick<00:01:42.390> them<00:01:42.630> in

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
to figure it out a way to stick them in

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.020 
to figure it out a way to stick them in
here<00:01:43.200> fill<00:01:43.950> with<00:01:44.250> glue<00:01:44.780> so<00:01:46.189> the<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.549> hole<00:01:47.759> will

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
here fill with glue so the the hole will

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.350 
here fill with glue so the the hole will
be<00:01:48.060> covered<00:01:48.570> it's<00:01:49.200> not<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.409> perfect<00:01:49.829> thing<00:01:50.369> but

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
be covered it's not a perfect thing but

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.630 
be covered it's not a perfect thing but
i'd<00:01:52.290> rather<00:01:52.350> have<00:01:53.600> those<00:01:54.600> crews<00:01:54.960> also<00:01:55.799> tighten

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
i'd rather have those crews also tighten

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.380 
i'd rather have those crews also tighten
in<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:57.000> body<00:01:57.299> as<00:01:57.659> well<00:01:57.719> as<00:01:58.259> in<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.560> neck<00:01:58.770> then

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
in the body as well as in the neck then

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.940 
in the body as well as in the neck then
the<00:02:00.390> screw<00:02:00.659> is<00:02:00.780> just<00:02:01.079> getting<00:02:01.380> through<00:02:01.649> it<00:02:01.829> in

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
the screw is just getting through it in

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.840 
the screw is just getting through it in
the<00:02:02.549> body<00:02:02.820> and<00:02:03.090> just<00:02:03.840> sticking<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.530> neck<00:02:04.850> I

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
the body and just sticking to the neck I

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.979 
the body and just sticking to the neck I
think<00:02:06.600> will<00:02:06.810> will<00:02:07.259> give<00:02:07.530> me<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:07.740> more<00:02:08.520> solid

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
think will will give me a more solid

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.900 
think will will give me a more solid
thing<00:02:09.989> well<00:02:10.440> I<00:02:10.470> won't<00:02:10.979> get<00:02:11.160> into<00:02:11.400> much<00:02:11.670> detail

thing well I won't get into much detail
of<00:02:12.300> this<00:02:12.510> preparation<00:02:13.020> because<00:02:13.290> it

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
of this preparation because it

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.570 
of this preparation because it
it's<00:02:13.830> not<00:02:13.950> something<00:02:14.430> that<00:02:15.830> any<00:02:16.830> of<00:02:17.010> you<00:02:17.250> would

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:43.120 

away

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.450 

you<00:03:43.490> can

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:46.460 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:50.080 

pull<00:03:47.030> it<00:03:47.210> a<00:03:47.240> little<00:03:47.330> bit<00:03:47.870> more<00:03:48.490> as<00:03:49.490> much<00:03:49.790> as<00:03:49.820> you

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
pull it a little bit more as much as you

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:55.300 
pull it a little bit more as much as you
can<00:03:52.000> see<00:03:53.200> now<00:03:54.200> it<00:03:54.410> went<00:03:54.620> all<00:03:54.800> the<00:03:54.920> way<00:03:54.950> that's

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
can see now it went all the way that's

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.580 
can see now it went all the way that's
that's<00:03:56.150> why<00:03:56.390> it's<00:03:56.570> important<00:03:57.020> to<00:03:57.140> cut<00:03:57.410> a

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
that's why it's important to cut a

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.380 
that's why it's important to cut a
little<00:03:58.070> less<00:03:58.520> than<00:03:59.030> you<00:03:59.210> actually<00:03:59.390> marked<00:04:00.280> so

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
little less than you actually marked so

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:07.090 
little less than you actually marked so
it<00:04:02.390> will<00:04:02.630> be<00:04:02.860> underneath<00:04:03.860> the<00:04:04.220> surface

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.120 

it<00:04:07.430> fast<00:04:07.730> as<00:04:07.970> the<00:04:08.090> surface<00:04:08.570> is<00:04:08.810> not<00:04:09.680> so<00:04:09.890> good

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
it fast as the surface is not so good

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.700 
it fast as the surface is not so good
and<00:04:11.090> you're<00:04:11.210> going<00:04:11.330> to<00:04:11.390> have<00:04:11.600> to<00:04:11.810> then<00:04:12.620> you

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:12.710 
and you're going to have to then you

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.770 
and you're going to have to then you
clean<00:04:13.010> up<00:04:13.100> the<00:04:13.160> mess<00:04:13.490> and<00:04:13.760> speed<00:04:14.030> you<00:04:14.180> have

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:22.650 

damp<00:04:17.780> cloth<00:04:18.170> Andy<00:04:19.180> clean<00:04:20.180> up<00:04:20.360> the<00:04:20.480> mess<00:04:21.100> and

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
damp cloth Andy clean up the mess and

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.770 
damp cloth Andy clean up the mess and
then<00:04:23.660> you<00:04:24.260> might<00:04:24.470> also<00:04:24.710> want<00:04:25.130> to<00:04:25.220> use<00:04:25.700> if<00:04:26.540> you

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
then you might also want to use if you

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.950 
then you might also want to use if you
want<00:04:27.020> the<00:04:27.460> sawdust<00:04:28.460> you<00:04:29.270> put<00:04:29.510> a<00:04:29.540> little<00:04:29.720> bit

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
want the sawdust you put a little bit

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.860 
want the sawdust you put a little bit
here<00:04:30.320> with<00:04:30.650> some<00:04:31.250> glue<00:04:31.520> so<00:04:31.790> it<00:04:31.970> will<00:04:32.330> get<00:04:32.510> a

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
here with some glue so it will get a

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.380 
here with some glue so it will get a
little<00:04:33.380> bit<00:04:33.650> darker<00:04:34.070> hole<00:04:34.280> this<00:04:34.850> is<00:04:35.120> not

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:35.390 
little bit darker hole this is not

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:39.070 
little bit darker hole this is not
important<00:04:35.870> but<00:04:36.250> might<00:04:37.250> be<00:04:37.400> good<00:04:37.550> idea<00:04:38.080> it's

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
important but might be good idea it's

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.940 
important but might be good idea it's
not<00:04:39.290> perfect<00:04:39.860> but<00:04:39.920> definitely<00:04:40.490> better<00:04:41.950> the

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
not perfect but definitely better the

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:46.600 
not perfect but definitely better the
holes<00:04:43.310> recovered<00:04:44.590> use<00:04:45.590> a<00:04:45.620> lot<00:04:46.010> of<00:04:46.040> matches

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
holes recovered use a lot of matches

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:52.780 
holes recovered use a lot of matches
here<00:04:47.150> i<00:04:47.740> use<00:04:48.740> the<00:04:49.130> sawdust<00:04:49.910> here<00:04:50.830> here<00:04:51.830> are<00:04:52.070> the
