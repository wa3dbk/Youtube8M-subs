mean nothing to worry about really and

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:13.240 
mean nothing to worry about really and
extended<00:02:08.330> it<00:02:08.450> quite<00:02:08.660> considerably<00:02:12.100> you<00:02:13.100> can

above<00:02:15.980> the<00:02:16.130> height<00:02:16.310> of<00:02:16.430> that<00:02:16.580> pipe<00:02:16.850> over<00:02:17.060> there

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
above the height of that pipe over there

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.890 
above the height of that pipe over there
so<00:02:18.500> there<00:02:18.650> was<00:02:18.740> never<00:02:18.890> gonna<00:02:19.070> fill<00:02:19.340> water<00:02:19.900> but

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900

for<00:03:16.060> about<00:03:16.510> four<00:03:16.840> o'clock<00:03:17.080> now<00:03:17.319> I<00:03:17.349> finally

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
for about four o'clock now I finally

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.820 
for about four o'clock now I finally
finished<00:03:18.220> doing<00:03:18.430> their<00:03:18.670> fencing

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
finished doing their fencing

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:21.960 
finished doing their fencing
it<00:03:20.830> took<00:03:21.129> a<00:03:21.190> bit<00:03:21.310> longer<00:03:21.340> than<00:03:21.580> I<00:03:21.700> thought

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
it took a bit longer than I thought

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.339 
it took a bit longer than I thought
actually<00:03:22.500> funny<00:03:23.500> how<00:03:23.709> to<00:03:23.769> use<00:03:24.069> one<00:03:24.280> new<00:03:24.459> rail

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:25.349 
actually funny how to use one new rail

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:30.449 
actually funny how to use one new rail
so<00:03:27.959> that's<00:03:28.959> the<00:03:29.110> result<00:03:29.349> my<00:03:29.709> to<00:03:29.769> recycle<00:03:30.400> all

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
so that's the result my to recycle all

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.620 
so that's the result my to recycle all
the<00:03:30.580> rails<00:03:30.790> that<00:03:31.060> were<00:03:31.180> on<00:03:31.420> the<00:03:32.230> pond<00:03:32.440> before
