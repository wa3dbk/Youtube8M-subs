00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
ebrill I have to say is a very hard

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.810 
ebrill I have to say is a very hard
place<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.410> snipe<00:00:46.800> believe<00:00:47.280> it<00:00:47.399> or<00:00:47.489> not<00:00:47.610> he's

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820

play style so if you think that your

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:05.000

playstyle<00:03:03.299> similar<00:03:03.719> to<00:03:03.840> mine<00:03:04.019> make<00:03:04.709> sure<00:03:04.889> you

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
playstyle similar to mine make sure you

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.860 
playstyle similar to mine make sure you
go<00:03:05.159> ahead<00:03:05.340> and<00:03:05.639> buy<00:03:05.969> him<00:03:06.150> and<00:03:06.359> also<00:03:06.659> if<00:03:06.750> you're

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
go ahead and buy him and also if you're

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.809 
go ahead and buy him and also if you're
a<00:03:06.900> skill<00:03:07.200> or<00:03:07.230> he<00:03:07.799> fits<00:03:08.040> your<00:03:08.219> place<00:03:08.430> now<00:03:08.579> as

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
a skill or he fits your place now as

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:10.640 
a skill or he fits your place now as
well<00:03:09.090> which<00:03:09.269> I'm<00:03:09.510> not<00:03:09.689> exactly<00:03:10.079> much<00:03:10.409> of<00:03:10.560> a

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
well which I'm not exactly much of a

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.770 
well which I'm not exactly much of a
scalar<00:03:10.919> so<00:03:11.189> overall<00:03:12.090> he's<00:03:12.389> gonna<00:03:12.540> get<00:03:12.719> a

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
scalar so overall he's gonna get a

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.340 
scalar so overall he's gonna get a
perfect<00:03:13.290> ten<00:03:13.560> out<00:03:13.769> of<00:03:13.829> ten
