okay<00:00:34.020> them<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.739> you<00:00:34.829> just<00:00:35.010> see<00:00:35.100> it

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
okay them and you just see it

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.280 
okay them and you just see it
initializes<00:00:35.790> for<00:00:35.969> a<00:00:36.000> moment<00:00:36.360> it<00:00:36.750> says<00:00:37.020> wait

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.660 

it's<00:00:46.390> analyzing<00:00:46.690> me<00:00:46.990> now<00:00:47.140> and<00:00:48.040> I<00:00:48.190> got<00:00:48.370> a<00:00:48.400> pass

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670 
it's analyzing me now and I got a pass

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.700 
it's analyzing me now and I got a pass
now<00:00:49.570> I<00:00:49.600> can<00:00:49.810> start<00:00:49.960> the<00:00:50.080> car<00:00:50.260> it<00:00:50.350> gives<00:00:50.470> you<00:00:50.560> 2

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
now I can start the car it gives you 2

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.290 
now I can start the car it gives you 2
minutes<00:00:50.920> and<00:00:51.130> counts<00:00:51.430> down<00:00:51.490> for<00:00:52.030> you<00:00:52.090> to<00:00:52.180> do

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
minutes and counts down for you to do

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.720 
minutes and counts down for you to do
that<00:00:52.330> I<00:00:52.720> had<00:00:53.080> to<00:00:53.260> blow<00:00:53.530> and<00:00:53.860> then<00:00:54.190> when<00:00:54.460> it<00:00:54.580> gave

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:54.730 
that I had to blow and then when it gave

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.090 
that I had to blow and then when it gave
me<00:00:54.850> a<00:00:54.910> tone<00:00:55.210> signal<00:00:55.540> I<00:00:55.870> had<00:00:56.260> to<00:00:56.440> make<00:00:56.590> a<00:00:56.620> humming

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
me a tone signal I had to make a humming

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.130 
me a tone signal I had to make a humming
sound<00:00:57.130> while<00:00:57.610> still<00:00:57.940> blowing<00:00:58.330> now<00:00:58.690> why<00:00:59.080> is

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
sound while still blowing now why is

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.230 
sound while still blowing now why is
that<00:00:59.320> so<00:01:00.190> that<00:01:00.370> you<00:01:00.460> haven't<00:01:00.760> hooked<00:01:00.850> up<00:01:01.060> a

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:01.240 
that so that you haven't hooked up a

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.840 
that so that you haven't hooked up a
balloon<00:01:01.780> or<00:01:02.140> a<00:01:02.230> tank<00:01:02.770> of<00:01:02.950> air<00:01:03.250> to<00:01:03.430> this<00:01:03.550> thing

balloon or a tank of air to this thing

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.220 
balloon or a tank of air to this thing
you<00:01:03.880> got<00:01:04.030> to<00:01:04.180> do<00:01:04.330> something<00:01:04.720> that<00:01:04.750> basically

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:05.230 
you got to do something that basically

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.410 
you got to do something that basically
only<00:01:05.380> a<00:01:05.470> human<00:01:05.860> can<00:01:06.070> do<00:01:06.250> as<00:01:06.430> I<00:01:06.790> drive<00:01:07.090> it's

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
only a human can do as I drive it's

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.240 
only a human can do as I drive it's
gonna<00:01:07.540> keep<00:01:07.780> prompting<00:01:08.320> me<00:01:08.440> for<00:01:08.830> random

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250
