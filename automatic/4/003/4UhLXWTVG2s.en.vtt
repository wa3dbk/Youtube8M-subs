00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:12.449
 for joel last on the amazon not like I'm still francs 

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:15.199
 today I will give you my opinion on how to choose a good 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:18.089
 pair of flippers for a lifeguard swimmer 

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:20.369
 we will start on five criteria 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.019
 the first will be the comfort 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:24.759
 actually we are not here to catch blisters 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:25.739
 then 10 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:29.779
 the speed the power according to white laurent evolves the point seek a 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:33.000
 designed to make very fast 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.330
 then the case the visibility 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.330
 a pair of fins that sees a lot 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.330
 allow it to the authors of well seen 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.050
 also quoted signs to people in the water that allows me to be better 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.100
 visible better understood 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.030
 we will also see the budget side 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.280
 on your budget and you will have access to this or that type of pearls 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:55.820
 and finally 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.600
 beware take the symmetrical fins 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.989
 because at the moment a fake ball solo 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.250
 thing certainly the failures and leave his intervention 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.440
 it's not time to ask if we have the right 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.770
 right foot 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.540
 and left palm left hopper 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.190
 before both schools 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.560
 and to those who prefer 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.570
 then we see the day 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.310
 then very great volleyball player with a nice amplitude 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.110
 so that it allows you to gradually gain speed and 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.110
 over long distances the bottom is rather advantageous 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.840
 alain at the muscular level it's less violent if in general 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.150
 little slippers so 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.630
 the Zion boss when you choose your pair of flippers 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.560
 you must be able to go barefoot in which you get to the slippers 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.880
 neoprene when you'll know about the beaches 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.880
 fousseret rarely in neoprene slippers 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:46.810
 some 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.020
 who want to hunt quickly 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.210
 find a little bit like that 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.050
 on pavements quickly 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.850
 very sincerely it's a good time anyway when care when 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.509
 even if you are waiting in the luggage 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:02.490
 with two things either we tend to take off 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.810
 in this frame had made a small hole in your office on the side like 6 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.010
 at the rail level 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.019
 and to fight 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:10.879
 you have to tinker for small files 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:12.329
 to avoid losing them 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:16.309
 to the good thing so that one distance if ever you are the great godfather 

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:19.159
 swimmers I advise you 500 of the big polluters 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:20.649
 why these two seasons 

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:24.309
 if you are a great swimmer after in general you even have to do without 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:27.969
 without the panels would be okay 

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:31.429
 and then the second school at the Cine Palms Bodyboard type 

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:32.659
 then percent 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:36.799
 relatively rigid subsidies so with high activity 

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:40.679
 so down this one for example if visible colors 

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:44.869
 do not forget how we can see some tourists can that the big 

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:46.420
 hole here that lies 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.429
 below this beginning of the week to evacuate the sand 

00:02:49.429 --> 00:02:51.669
 and the fleet 

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:55.219
 advantage of this type of lost not knows how to get a victim out of the water 

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:59.139
 it would have been enough just he spent here at the bench 

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:04.430
 so we can also use decorations because of the presence of 6% 

00:03:04.429 --> 00:03:06.379
 children of the world 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:10.430
 while the pair of aces the pair of wood level planks here and it's 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.259
 left 

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:16.049
 from him to more my body now that I'm going to realize at 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:18.979
 course of interventions over long distances 

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:22.119
 or it is true that having a small bowl of gold will be given 

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:24.209
 a goal of andy kapp 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:27.029
 now that is relatively well marketed with must be careful when 

00:03:27.029 --> 00:03:31.349
 even though if the interventions on the rocks had been 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:32.759
 a good model 

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:34.089
 a year ago that 

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:37.709
 on the one hand especially one thing at the chosen moment ans and if to test them first in 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.949
 loving mother who signs 

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:44.999
 inquire left right he had martine full of good marks 

00:03:44.999 --> 00:03:46.289
 and at least 

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:49.439
 we will try without shame to make 

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:53.980
 and also remember one thing is that not a lifeguard and palm mathilde 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:58.789
 it is not necessarily the colleague don that pci and make your own opinion 

00:03:59.839 --> 00:04:03.639
 and then validity not shared with having area it was far from francs 

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:04.499
 for the death of man
