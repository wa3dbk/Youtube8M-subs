Hi, I'm Nick Kazakov and I'm going to share my experience in Burnout

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Burnout is very effective and relatively simple trick

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
You should install side protection on your motorcycle for training

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.000
It is also desirable to install easy-pull clutch

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.000
Handlebar or clipons should be rotated forward to move pressure point closer to the front 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:53.000
Training spot should be clean and without dust

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:01.000
If you never do burnouts, It's better to start stopping front wheel with barrier

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.000
In this case bike will not fly out if you lose control

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000
To make burnout you should pull the clutch

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.000
raise the engine speed

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.000
block front wheel with front brake

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.000
push the fork

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.000
release the clutch fast

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Release the clutch fully and fast

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Do not reduce engine speed

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Pull the clutch to STOP burnout

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.000
After try to make stand still burnount

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
The algorithm is the same

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Try to increase or decrease the throttle to better feel the rear wheel hitch

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Always keep in mind the clutch and pull it if loosing control

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
After learning stand still burnout, try to do rolling burnout

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Rolling butnout is started when the fork is loaded

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
To load the fork, move your body weight as far forward and at the same time squeeze the front brake

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Moving your body every inch counts, so you should try as hard as possible to reach for the front wheel

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Preferably even get up on toes

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Immediately it will not turn out because of unnatural position which requires skill

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.000
Sequence of actions is following

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Pull the clutch moving on 1th gear

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Move body weight as far forward and squeeze the front brake

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Increase the throttle and keep it stable

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.100
Braking front brake

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.000
Release the clutch fully and fast

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Reduce the front brake to go straight

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Bike's speed  is regulated by the front brake

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Do not lose your concentration and keep the fork loaded

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Pull the clutch to stop burnout

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:08.000
Try to speed up and slow down

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Periodically ride across the spot to cool the front brakes

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.000
After learning rolling burnout try to do burnout "8"
What next video about it
