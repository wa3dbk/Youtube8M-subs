expertise<00:04:41.980> Mike<00:04:42.980> the<00:04:43.100> wafer<00:04:43.460> known<00:04:43.850> like<00:04:44.360> each

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
expertise Mike the wafer known like each

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.410 
expertise Mike the wafer known like each
enhancement<00:04:45.740> has<00:04:45.890> got<00:04:46.040> six<00:04:46.430> expertise<00:04:47.150> or

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:47.420 
enhancement has got six expertise or

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.200 
enhancement has got six expertise or
three<00:04:48.430> depending<00:04:49.430> on<00:04:49.580> which<00:04:49.940> one<00:04:50.090> you<00:04:50.180> choose

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
three depending on which one you choose

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:51.850 
three depending on which one you choose
because<00:04:50.570> they<00:04:50.750> have<00:04:50.930> got<00:04:51.110> different<00:04:51.260> balances

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
because they have got different balances

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.440 
because they have got different balances
so<00:04:52.370> potentially<00:04:52.790> you<00:04:52.850> could<00:04:52.910> get<00:04:53.120> rating<00:04:53.360> of
