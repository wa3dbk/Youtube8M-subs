00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 hi girls today we are going to talk about the 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.500
 Benefits of papaya and its seeds 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.420
 this is an information video before 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.730
 perform any natural treatment 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.280
 Please consult your doctor 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.049
 header there are people that can be 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.779
 allergic to some ingredients 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.630
 natural the benefits of papain 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.480
 for health the papaya contains a 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.220
 enzyme called papain this chemical is 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.980
 very similar to the enzymes of the pancreas 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.230
 that help digest protein the 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.809
 protein digestive enzymes also 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.550
 called proteolytic enzymes can 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.989
 dissolve the protein layer that is 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.690
 shape around the cells 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.219
 cancerous this helps the system 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.070
 immune to destroy them more 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.890
 easily another enzyme present in the 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.809
 papaya is chyme papain both chemical 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.449
 help to take better advantage of the protein 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.129
 useful food enzymes 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.610
 proteolytics can destroy 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:59.100
 virus defense shields tumors 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.030
 Yeast allergens and various forms of 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.789
 mushrooms 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.549
 once these shields are destroyed not 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.100
 it will be easy to heal papain too 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.560
 Helps reduce inflammation and heal 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.409
 burns and reduce scars in 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.200
 papaya skin really accelerates the 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.140
 carotenoid healing process that 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.909
 protect from oxidation the color pink 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.399
 orange of the papaya is due to the 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.850
 presence of carotenoids in particular 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:29.580
 of beta carotene and lycopene these are 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.429
 antioxidants and are effective agents of 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.640
 fight against cancer lycopene can 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:37.080
 reduce the risk of prostate cancer 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.240
 this chemical induces the death of 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.700
 cancer cells increases the 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.220
 anti metastatic activity and reinforces 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.409
 the protective enzymes in a 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.090
 research done in china is 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.490
 discovered that food intake 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.220
 Rich in lycopene and green tea protect 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.569
 against prostate cancer 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.090
 isothiocyanates to avoid the appearance 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:58.860
 of cancer cells 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.649
 isothiocyanates is another compound of 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.750
 the papaya this compound has shown 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:06.270
 be able to inhibit the training and the 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.090
 development of cancer cells 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.649
 in experiments with animals was shown 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.769
 that isothiocyanates are effective 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:17.640
 against breast cancer lung colon 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:20.550
 pancreas prostate and leukemia others 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.970
 benefits of papaya papayas are 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.860
 rich in antioxidant nutrients 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.590
 carotenes vitamins ce her and 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.930
 flavonoids also contain the 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.239
 vitamins of group b folic acid and 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.150
 pantothenic acid and minerals like 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.890
 potassium and magnesium all these elements 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.760
 promote a cardiovascular system 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.380
 healthy and protect against cancer 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.540
 they also help maintain a system 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.880
 healthy immune prevent 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.700
 recurrent ear infections the 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.500
 Colds and the flu are also rich 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.049
 in fiber so they can reduce the 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.730
 cholesterol levels fiber too 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:59.010
 is able to bind toxins 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.829
 causing cancer in the colon and 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.470
 facilitates the digestion utility of 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:06.450
 papaya seeds the seeds of the 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.299
 papaya can be even more beneficial than 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:12.269
 the fruit have a very spicy flavor and 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:14.030
 bitter these characteristics can 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.730
 make difficult 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:19.430
 despite all its medicinal value is 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:22.370
 very important among its benefits 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.050
 are antibacterial properties that 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.140
 makes them effective against coli 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:29.030
 salmonella and staphylococcus can 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.880
 protect kidneys from failure 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.180
 induced by toxins facilitate 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:37.730
 elimination of intestinal parasites 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.709
 helps to detoxify the papaya liver 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:40.510
 It is a fruit that is worth including in 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:43.280
 the daily diet 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:46.340
 the ideal would be to consume at least one 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.019
 once a week for its taste is very 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:51.140
 versatile since it can be included in 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:54.290
 recipes like salads desserts with yogurt 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.510
 with lemon and chili and so on 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.430
 do not miss the opportunity to 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.950
 take advantage of its incredible benefits 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:03.410
 for health girls if they know any 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:06.850
 natural remedy please do not forget 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.850
 share it in the comments
