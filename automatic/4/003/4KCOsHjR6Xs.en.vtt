Brian<00:00:56.000> I'm<00:00:57.000> gonna<00:00:57.180> start<00:00:57.420> with<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.539> nice<00:00:57.690> big

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
Brian I'm gonna start with a nice big

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.549 
Brian I'm gonna start with a nice big
pot<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.760> gallon<00:00:59.760> of<00:00:59.850> water<00:01:00.079> about<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.109> gallon<00:01:01.410> of

pot a gallon of water about a gallon of
water<00:01:01.770> what's<00:01:02.760> important<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.359> that<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.660> beef

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
water what's important is that the beef

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.980 
water what's important is that the beef
is<00:01:04.019> submerged<00:01:04.500> under<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.010> water<00:01:05.780> to<00:01:06.780> that

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.630 

okay<00:01:24.180> do<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:24.659> salted<00:01:25.229> water<00:01:25.439> 1/2<00:01:26.250> a<00:01:26.369> cup<00:01:26.520> of

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
brown sugar you could use honey or

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.980 
brown sugar you could use honey or
regular<00:01:28.619> sugar<00:01:28.770> I<00:01:29.090> prefer<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.119> brown<00:01:30.390> sugar<00:01:30.780> and

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
regular sugar I prefer a brown sugar and

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.050 
regular sugar I prefer a brown sugar and
I'm<00:01:31.710> going<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:31.860> take<00:01:32.009> some<00:01:32.250> whole<00:01:32.549> cloves<00:01:32.880> of

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
I'm going to take some whole cloves of

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.090 
I'm going to take some whole cloves of
garlic<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.659> just<00:01:34.200> smash<00:01:34.470> them<00:01:34.680> up<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.890> bit

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
garlic and just smash them up a bit

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.590 
garlic and just smash them up a bit
they<00:01:35.369> really<00:01:35.700> release<00:01:35.970> their<00:01:36.180> flavor<00:01:36.270> in

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
they really release their flavor in

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.330 
they really release their flavor in
there<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:36.840> don't<00:01:36.990> have<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.229> chop<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:37.680> but<00:01:38.130> just

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
there you don't have to chop it but just

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.550 
there you don't have to chop it but just
give<00:01:38.700> them<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.820> nice<00:01:39.000> smash<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:40.320> then<00:01:40.409> I'm<00:01:40.470> just

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
give them a nice smash and then I'm just

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.179 
give them a nice smash and then I'm just
using<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.890> edge<00:01:41.009> of<00:01:41.159> my<00:01:41.189> knife<00:01:41.460> here<00:01:42.860> and<00:01:43.860> that

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
using the edge of my knife here and that

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.160 
using the edge of my knife here and that
seems<00:01:44.399> like<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.579> lot<00:01:44.759> of<00:01:44.790> garlic<00:01:44.970> I<00:01:45.390> want<00:01:46.079> this

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
seems like a lot of garlic I want this

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.289 
seems like a lot of garlic I want this
to<00:01:46.320> taste<00:01:46.500> good<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:46.979> really<00:01:47.490> flavorful<00:01:47.610> there

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
to taste good and really flavorful there

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.700

they are good to go right on here I'm

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.590 
they are good to go right on here I'm

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
gonna pop them into 400 and 450 degree

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.010 
gonna pop them into 400 and 450 degree
oven<00:05:01.190> they<00:05:02.190> take<00:05:02.370> about<00:05:02.490> half<00:05:03.180> an<00:05:03.300> hour<00:05:03.420> so<00:05:03.810> it

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
oven they take about half an hour so it

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.750 
oven they take about half an hour so it
depends<00:05:04.320> on<00:05:04.380> your<00:05:04.440> oven<00:05:04.590> but<00:05:05.280> you<00:05:05.400> want<00:05:05.580> them

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760 
depends on your oven but you want them

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.640 
depends on your oven but you want them
to<00:05:05.820> get<00:05:05.940> nice<00:05:06.120> and<00:05:06.180> brown<00:05:06.540> and<00:05:07.020> and<00:05:07.380> really

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
to get nice and brown and and really

really<00:05:08.010> caramelized<00:05:08.460> and<00:05:08.580> flavorful<00:05:08.910> so<00:05:09.090> you

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
really caramelized and flavorful so you

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:10.370 
really caramelized and flavorful so you
might<00:05:09.270> have<00:05:09.390> to<00:05:09.450> flip<00:05:09.690> them<00:05:09.870> over<00:05:09.960> at<00:05:10.230> some

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
might have to flip them over at some

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.560 
might have to flip them over at some
point<00:05:10.590> so<00:05:10.680> just<00:05:10.830> keep<00:05:10.980> an<00:05:11.100> eye<00:05:11.220> on<00:05:11.400> them<00:05:11.610> first
