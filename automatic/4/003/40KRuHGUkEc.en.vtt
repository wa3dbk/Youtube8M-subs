 during that second 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.609
 it must then be the other for the week 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.269
 instead 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.269
 I don't really know at all 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.900

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.960
 sold less during the minutes 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.850
 the team from the tests typifies coffee at the juniors zero 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.880
 is it military chiefs 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.990
 in the selection involving snipers 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.890
 fur house the head roll of image is going to be a cessna with six in the koreans 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.210
 busy to meet a much stricter requirement as the island is now around the 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.390
 sixty mulder to be honest, it is too fast on the spot 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.650
 the faster help on the turns 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.320
 it is about the area that must be the alpine country 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.080
 Jan Blokhuijsen Store Jan Blokhuijsen who have 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.670
 because for us 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.100
 they will indicate themselves 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.080
 was that runs from 50 to 80 liters of soup 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.000
 hereby takes over 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.010
 and the koreans only accelerated many parts 8 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.860
 This is ridiculously fast that it is for the dunes that suffers from the schedule of 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:42.750
 the 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.560
 I say sometimes 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.320
 for 2010 from the Netherlands consisting of Sven Kramer Carl and Heben

 are all bale and short track riders 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.380
 but and 25 euros martin you never see read 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.469
 we as sure as those who look over shoulder to the left as it is 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.590
 that software was not saved 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.590
 yes then something happened then 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.169
 that is the question 

00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:13.689
 so definitely recommend guidance 

00:02:13.689 --> 00:02:16.689
 that is left the union let the lap times down 

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:21.359
 this morning stood for the daily win 

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:28.459
 such major consequences in the Netherlands 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:29.959
 on the solid points 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.019
 For example, now the difference is bigger for reactor which he says 

00:02:33.749 --> 00:02:35.599

 Dorothy 7 6 7 3 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.339
 two laps time to act for something 

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:42.339
 on it's own 

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:48.139
 Kramer rode on 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.969
 they take care of themselves 

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:56.969

00:02:59.249 --> 00:03:01.479
 look at that numbered in numbers 

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:04.479
 the peak in arrears they have completely inflated themselves 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.239
 now the Netherlands could fly because of this 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:14.409
 because in the rankings 

00:03:25.279 --> 00:03:26.929
 well off 

00:03:26.929 --> 00:03:29.929

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:34.809
 novum the pvv 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:41.069
 photo were necessary 

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:49.899
 but barely started 

00:03:49.899 --> 00:03:51.959
 ibi the arrival of team netherlands 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.739
 also this legislation 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:57.309
 65 logical 

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:58.959
 about the jobs for 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:02.439

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:03.679
 the floriade 

00:04:03.679 --> 00:04:06.679
 the Netherlands were under pressure for a while 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:10.699
 a cow collapsed there 

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:13.569

 birthday boy is adjourned 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.389
 a convincing read much more convincing than a week ago left foot with 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:24.759
 same result 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:29.919
 the netherlands wins korea or not 2 is about 4 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:31.180
 some stood 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.760
 his successor as something not in good order, that is why they are not 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:39.790
 the Dutch ioc 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.790
 seems to be advertising demand supply a thousand years can raise the bar 

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:45.580
 I think the name and given name will be 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.849
 drove relaxed we have kept enough for the 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:51.849
 five kilometers tomorrow 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.400
 this one 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.550
 price is in the Netherlands and the Netherlands wins all competitions this season already 4 in the world 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.550
 cup a person credit so also standings 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.870
 for the koreans 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.610
 nevertheless, a formidable opponent may be able to become an earlier state 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:13.419
 approved 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:15.739
