00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
I was found incredibly difficult to

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.039 
I was found incredibly difficult to
figure<00:00:13.620> out<00:00:13.830> until<00:00:14.340> I<00:00:14.370> just<00:00:14.759> kind<00:00:15.269> of<00:00:15.389> heard<00:00:15.929> a

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
figure out until I just kind of heard a

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.750 
figure out until I just kind of heard a
different<00:00:16.379> way<00:00:16.529> to<00:00:16.560> think<00:00:16.830> about<00:00:17.310> it<00:00:17.460> so

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
different way to think about it so

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.929 
different way to think about it so
hopefully<00:00:17.880> i<00:00:18.449> will<00:00:19.220> say<00:00:20.220> it<00:00:20.369> properly<00:00:20.640> and

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
hopefully i will say it properly and

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.240 
hopefully i will say it properly and
you'll<00:00:21.210> be<00:00:21.359> able<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.720> do<00:00:22.380> fine<00:00:22.650> figure<00:00:23.070> it<00:00:23.130> out

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
you'll be able to do fine figure it out

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.160 
you'll be able to do fine figure it out
i'm<00:00:23.640> going<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:23.939> use<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.090> different<00:00:24.869> colors<00:00:25.140> for

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
i'm going to use a different colors for

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.839 
i'm going to use a different colors for
the<00:00:25.350> tops<00:00:25.619> just<00:00:25.920> so<00:00:26.039> it<00:00:26.220> make<00:00:26.430> it<00:00:26.550> a<00:00:26.580> bit<00:00:26.820> easier

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
the tops just so it make it a bit easier

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:33.830 
the tops just so it make it a bit easier
to<00:00:27.240> follow<00:00:29.599> so<00:00:30.599> we<00:00:30.750> take<00:00:30.960> one<00:00:32.570> whatever<00:00:33.570> color

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.810 

there<00:00:49.260> we<00:00:50.160> go<00:00:50.309> wrist<00:00:50.940> here<00:00:52.039> and<00:00:53.039> then<00:00:53.610> just

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
there we go wrist here and then just

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.790 
there we go wrist here and then just
twist<00:00:54.420> in<00:00:55.250> and<00:00:56.250> walk<00:00:56.670> that<00:00:56.969> through<00:00:57.449> and

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
twist in and walk that through and

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.920 
twist in and walk that through and
though<00:00:58.800> we<00:00:58.980> are<00:00:59.190> fairly<00:00:59.969> close<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.659> same

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
though we are fairly close to the same

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.160 
though we are fairly close to the same
size<00:01:01.230> okay<00:01:02.070> then<00:01:02.760> we'll<00:01:02.879> take<00:01:03.089> another<00:01:03.269> bloom

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
size okay then we'll take another bloom

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.680 
size okay then we'll take another bloom
once<00:01:04.890> again<00:01:05.100> at<00:01:05.220> 260<00:01:07.700> blowing<00:01:08.700> up<00:01:08.790> all<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.570> way

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 
once again at 260 blowing up all the way

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.320 
once again at 260 blowing up all the way
again<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:10.649> little<00:01:11.190> bit<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.610> bubble<00:01:11.940> there<00:01:12.119> I

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
again a little bit of a bubble there I

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:19.010 
again a little bit of a bubble there I
it<00:01:14.720> give<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.899> slight<00:01:16.229> touch<00:01:17.180> anything<00:01:18.180> third

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
it give it a slight touch anything third

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.419 
it give it a slight touch anything third
and<00:01:21.050> once<00:01:22.050> again<00:01:22.200> that's<00:01:22.530> how<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:22.800> find<00:01:23.220> my

00:01:23.419 --> 00:01:23.429 
and once again that's how I find my

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:32.300 
and once again that's how I find my
third<00:01:27.979> round<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:30.560> lock<00:01:31.560> it<00:01:31.800> in<00:01:31.920> that's

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
third round and lock it in that's

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.499 
third round and lock it in that's
approximately<00:01:33.440> equal<00:01:34.440> we'll<00:01:35.220> take<00:01:35.399> our<00:01:35.640> blue

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
approximately equal we'll take our blue

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.440 
approximately equal we'll take our blue
one<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:36.869> our<00:01:37.289> pink<00:01:37.800> one<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.220> we'll<00:01:38.850> spin<00:01:39.210> them

one and our pink one and we'll spin them
together<00:01:42.020> we'll<00:01:43.020> get<00:01:43.170> another<00:01:43.440> pink<00:01:43.800> one<00:01:43.979> ms

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
together we'll get another pink one ms

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.660 
together we'll get another pink one ms
will<00:01:44.940> get<00:01:45.090> rid<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.299> them<00:01:45.600> totally<00:01:46.080> there<00:01:46.920> we're

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
will get rid of them totally there we're

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.809 
will get rid of them totally there we're
so<00:01:47.819> far<00:01:48.060> into<00:01:48.420> it<00:01:48.450> doesn't<00:01:49.049> matter<00:01:51.080> okay<00:01:52.819> take

00:01:53.809 --> 00:01:53.819 
so far into it doesn't matter okay take

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:59.300 
so far into it doesn't matter okay take
our<00:01:54.030> pink<00:01:54.330> one<00:01:56.000> stretch<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.860> hold<00:01:58.860> it<00:01:59.009> into

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
our pink one stretch it hold it into

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:05.839 
our pink one stretch it hold it into
thirds<00:02:01.729> then<00:02:02.729> our<00:02:03.509> blue<00:02:03.989> one<00:02:04.520> get<00:02:05.520> rid<00:02:05.729> of<00:02:05.759> that

00:02:05.839 --> 00:02:05.849 
thirds then our blue one get rid of that

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:16.190 
thirds then our blue one get rid of that
and<00:02:08.179> rocking<00:02:09.179> this<00:02:10.280> spin<00:02:12.319> spin<00:02:13.879> spin<00:02:15.200> we'll
