lashline<00:03:58.550> and<00:03:59.550> then<00:04:00.300> I<00:04:00.390> also<00:04:00.630> go<00:04:00.990> back<00:04:01.200> in<00:04:01.410> to

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:02.210 
lashline and then I also go back in to

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:06.140 
lashline and then I also go back in to
elongate<00:04:03.210> my<00:04:03.420> eyes<00:04:03.600> at<00:04:04.200> the<00:04:04.380> tear<00:04:04.590> ducts<00:04:05.150> so
