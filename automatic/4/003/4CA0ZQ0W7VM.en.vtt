00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.670
 hello girls already all then how 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.869
 see I did a little hair a 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.970
 ringlets is indeed today will make a tutorial 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.189
 suitable precisely because curly hair 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.320
 wavy and wavy 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.540
 it is a very simple procedure suitable 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.760
 especially the most daily occasions 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.220
 however of course if used for example 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.230
 from the decorative elements we say right 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.840
 for the evening it can go very well too 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.850
 for a dinner for aperitifs for 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.160
 of the holidays of course is always the 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:58.230
 your choice t for the inter v 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:59.880
 you will need a comb a fixative I in 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.920
 this case I use a school of 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.350
 hedgehogs as I precisely to the hair 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:09.750
 smooth and therefore this foam life more 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:11.220
 definition of hairpins e 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.630
 use a rubber band here 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.439
 because my color is approaching 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.659
 of hair 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.909
 the first thing I'm going to do is go 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.950
 to apply under the hair the 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:26.429
 my fading then he has more composed the 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:30.569
 right of the hand in this way here and 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:33.439
 I'm going to make this move so 

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:33.439
 define curls 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.020
 ok guys once this is done i go to 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.020
 create a side line 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:00.820
 I already had it but I do it 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.820
 review and fly your hair 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:10.819
 ok at this point i take all mine 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.260
 hair and I wear them on one side you can 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.880
 naturally choose whether to take them to 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.200
 right or left 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.050
 ok i'm going to get mine now 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:25.430
 elastic and I'm going to create a tail 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:29.890
 simple low side ok 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.890
 like this here now 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.620
 I hold the hairpins close to me 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:41.959
 take a bush from one end e 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:48.280
 I'm going to pull this way here and go 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:48.280
 to stop work with a hairpin 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:56.940
 and it continues this way also with some other 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:56.940
 plays 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:24.340
 this is the final result here 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:26.739
 of course then you can fix the 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.269
 it seems what you like and if you want 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:29.860
 you can also add to make 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:31.330
 even more beautiful the hairstyle of the 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.780
 decorative elements for example of the 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.780
 white roses 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.200
 I hope for this final result 

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:57.819
 I liked mimicking an obsessive 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.819
 kiss and the next video hello
