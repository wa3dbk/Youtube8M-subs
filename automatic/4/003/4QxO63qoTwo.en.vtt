00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
snow tubing before but I gotta say just

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.680 
snow tubing before but I gotta say just
from<00:00:11.400> doing<00:00:11.550> the<00:00:11.700> first<00:00:11.910> one<00:00:12.120> but<00:00:12.300> it's<00:00:12.450> pretty

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
from doing the first one but it's pretty

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.400 
from doing the first one but it's pretty
cool<00:00:12.929> stuff<00:00:13.370> so<00:00:14.370> all<00:00:14.460> you<00:00:14.730> gotta<00:00:14.880> do<00:00:15.089> is<00:00:15.420> if<00:00:16.199> you

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
cool stuff so all you gotta do is if you

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.800 
cool stuff so all you gotta do is if you
just<00:00:16.560> had<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:16.770> use<00:00:16.890> this<00:00:17.100> slide<00:00:17.520> it<00:00:17.810> over

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
just had to use this slide it over

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.210 
just had to use this slide it over
whatever<00:00:19.320> point<00:00:19.939> and<00:00:21.439> then<00:00:22.439> go<00:00:22.890> ahead<00:00:23.130> and

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
whatever point and then go ahead and

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.900 
whatever point and then go ahead and
grab<00:00:23.430> my<00:00:23.550> lighter<00:00:25.279> and<00:00:26.279> instantly<00:00:26.760> you<00:00:26.849> can

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
grab my lighter and instantly you can

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.589

see<00:00:27.240> it<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:28.250> shrinking<00:00:29.250> hook<00:00:29.580> I<00:00:29.880> guess<00:00:30.390> that's

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
see it a shrinking hook I guess that's

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.030 
see it a shrinking hook I guess that's
why<00:00:30.720> they<00:00:30.810> call<00:00:30.840> it<00:00:31.050> heat<00:00:31.199> shrink<00:00:31.439> tubing<00:00:31.769> but

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
why they call it heat shrink tubing but

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.340 
why they call it heat shrink tubing but
