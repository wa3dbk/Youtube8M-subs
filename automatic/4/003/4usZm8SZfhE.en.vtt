you want to increase the resolution of
the<00:01:45.869> mouse<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.229> you're<00:01:46.649> not<00:01:46.770> programmed

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
the mouse and you're not programmed

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.289 
the mouse and you're not programmed
that's<00:01:47.490> how<00:01:47.609> you're<00:01:47.700> going<00:01:47.789> to<00:01:47.909> do<00:01:47.969> with<00:01:48.149> these

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
that's how you're going to do with these

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:49.880 
that's how you're going to do with these
buttons<00:01:48.689> it's<00:01:49.289> going<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.439> let<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:49.619> get<00:01:49.710> up<00:01:49.799> to

3200 DPI that's the maximum resolution
of<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:52.679> sensor<00:01:53.009> that's<00:01:53.130> on<00:01:53.310> here<00:01:53.429> it's<00:01:53.579> a

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:53.609 
of the sensor that's on here it's a

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:56.389 
of the sensor that's on here it's a
laser<00:01:53.850> sensor<00:01:54.329> on<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.350> bottom<00:01:55.619> couple<00:01:56.250> things

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
laser sensor on the bottom couple things

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.069 
laser sensor on the bottom couple things
going<00:01:56.609> on<00:01:56.759> you're<00:01:56.939> gonna<00:01:57.000> see<00:01:57.210> that<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.539> ultra

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
going on you're gonna see that the ultra

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.929 
going on you're gonna see that the ultra
slick<00:01:58.649> feet<00:01:58.859> that<00:01:58.979> I<00:01:59.009> told<00:01:59.219> you<00:01:59.340> about<00:01:59.399> the

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
slick feet that I told you about the

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.669 
slick feet that I told you about the
3200<00:02:00.570> DPI<00:02:00.810> sensor<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.259> I<00:02:01.320> told<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:01.590> about

00:02:01.669 --> 00:02:01.679 
3200 DPI sensor that I told you about

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:03.649 
3200 DPI sensor that I told you about
and<00:02:02.009> also<00:02:02.460> I<00:02:02.640> mentioned<00:02:03.179> some<00:02:03.450> weights

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
and also I mentioned some weights

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.419 
and also I mentioned some weights
earlier<00:02:04.020> i<00:02:04.229> want<00:02:04.619> to<00:02:04.679> show<00:02:04.829> you<00:02:04.859> those<00:02:05.130> there<00:02:05.399> a

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:05.429 
earlier i want to show you those there a

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:06.980 
earlier i want to show you those there a
little<00:02:05.670> bit<00:02:05.850> tough<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.090> get<00:02:06.240> out<00:02:06.420> so<00:02:06.840> you<00:02:06.960> don't

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
little bit tough to get out so you don't

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.210 
little bit tough to get out so you don't
do<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:07.259> by<00:02:07.350> accident<00:02:07.469> but<00:02:07.799> basically<00:02:08.070> you

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
do it by accident but basically you

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.360 
do it by accident but basically you
rotate<00:02:08.550> them<00:02:09.259> slap<00:02:10.259> them<00:02:10.440> out<00:02:10.590> and<00:02:10.890> you<00:02:11.130> see<00:02:11.340> a

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
rotate them slap them out and you see a

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.860 
rotate them slap them out and you see a
bunch<00:02:11.640> of<00:02:11.730> different<00:02:11.850> three<00:02:12.330> gram<00:02:12.570> weights

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
bunch of different three gram weights

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.080 
bunch of different three gram weights
and<00:02:13.140> you<00:02:13.650> can<00:02:13.769> put<00:02:13.890> as<00:02:14.010> many<00:02:14.280> as<00:02:14.550> you<00:02:14.730> want<00:02:14.909> so

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
and you can put as many as you want so

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.149 
and you can put as many as you want so
sometimes<00:02:15.480> most<00:02:16.230> people<00:02:16.500> like<00:02:16.709> anywhere<00:02:17.040> from

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
sometimes most people like anywhere from

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:19.010 
sometimes most people like anywhere from
seven<00:02:17.550> to<00:02:17.670> 14<00:02:18.060> grams

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
seven to 14 grams

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.120 
seven to 14 grams
this<00:02:19.230> is<00:02:19.350> a<00:02:19.380> little<00:02:19.560> bit<00:02:19.650> more<00:02:19.740> precise

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
this is a little bit more precise

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.130 
this is a little bit more precise
because<00:02:20.250> they're<00:02:20.520> in<00:02:20.700> threes<00:02:21.150> instead<00:02:21.510> of<00:02:21.630> 7s

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
because they're in threes instead of 7s

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.530 
because they're in threes instead of 7s
or<00:02:22.200> force<00:02:22.470> so<00:02:23.280> basically<00:02:23.730> you<00:02:23.940> get<00:02:24.060> to<00:02:24.240> get<00:02:24.510> a

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
or force so basically you get to get a

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.180 
or force so basically you get to get a
little<00:02:24.840> bit<00:02:24.930> more<00:02:25.050> precise<00:02:25.410> but<00:02:25.680> about<00:02:26.130> the

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
little bit more precise but about the

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.590 
little bit more precise but about the
same<00:02:26.520> you<00:02:26.730> don't<00:02:26.940> get<00:02:27.060> to<00:02:27.150> choose<00:02:27.330> where<00:02:27.570> you

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
same you don't get to choose where you

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.420 
same you don't get to choose where you
want<00:02:27.750> them<00:02:28.020> but<00:02:28.260> it<00:02:28.590> doesn't<00:02:28.920> really<00:02:29.100> matter

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
want them but it doesn't really matter

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.620 
want them but it doesn't really matter
if<00:02:29.640> you've<00:02:29.760> ever<00:02:29.880> actually<00:02:30.060> tried<00:02:30.360> to<00:02:30.480> move

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
if you've ever actually tried to move

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.240 
if you've ever actually tried to move
them<00:02:30.780> around<00:02:30.900> inside<00:02:31.410> the<00:02:31.590> base<00:02:31.770> plate<00:02:31.950> it

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
them around inside the base plate it

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.820 
them around inside the base plate it
doesn't<00:02:32.940> matter<00:02:33.090> at<00:02:33.420> all<00:02:33.690> it's<00:02:34.560> really

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
doesn't matter at all it's really

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.160 
doesn't matter at all it's really
basically<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:35.580> same<00:02:35.730> thing<00:02:36.120> so<00:02:36.840> that's<00:02:37.050> it

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
basically the same thing so that's it
