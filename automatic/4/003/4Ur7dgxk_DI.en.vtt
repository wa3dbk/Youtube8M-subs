 this mystery that has here a lot of 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.950
 people are getting crazy 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:44.219
 to unveil it by the following question 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:47.190
 this drawing on the wall when you 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.710
 the cable car and comes here in this 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.149
 area you will find this drawing that 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.300
 the staff is saying that it is one of the 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:57.360
 the greatest mysteries within the gt a 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.059
 beauty of one of the greatest mysteries 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.660
 old boy would be like 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:06.330
 were in a jet pack that 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:11.040
 left for users looking for a 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:13.500
 possible jetpack very strange to galley 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.600
 Do you want to reach the location of the game? 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.479
 asks to save as if it were part 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.740
 of the game that every time you buy 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.830
 a mission we know that 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.630
 automatically saves or when you arrive 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.150
 here it 's like you're part of a 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.570
 goal a secret mission and if you 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.420
 to notice in the field here has a mark one 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.659
 band of yellow and black that 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.390
 to finish something or is to take 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.490
 care something like this but more 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.270
 strange that it only appears in that part 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.610
 back on the wall 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.189
 drawing this is very strange and beyond 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.439
 The presence of cameras here is also 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:56.430
 funny that only stays in that part of 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:59.939
 behind the wall plate followed by a 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.399
 careful with the location is monitored right 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.710
 It's strange that I arrive. 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.780
 here they have this bridge broken as if 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.940
 there was continuation somewhere 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.550
 but if there had been an accident 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.100
 Of course here is a ramp 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.430
 user process 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.680
 and right there behind the erosion realize that 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.750
 is that part that you must have 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.120
 know what is written 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.070
 come back here when your story is 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.220
 complete and everyone knows when you 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.930
 5% of the game here appears with the 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.450
 hair plus one of the most 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.940
 strange that I found down there in the 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:39.690
 in the entrance of this wall that 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.190
 It gives the impression that a 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.110
 blood mark 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.350
 I do not know can be minimum print 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.660
 It may be land, too, but I have this 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.870
 great impression here in here no 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.940
 There's nothing I've ever tried to look at is empty. 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.720
 but it's very strange it does not stop being 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.540
 weird 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.780
 the most interesting is that it would also be the 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:04.200
 presence of these antennas because it would 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.780
 antennas if there is nothing here that you use 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.090
 they do not fail to have is also the 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.580
 view screens would be so much for 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:16.020
 send the tale to receive some kind 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:18.870
 well-differentiated signal 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:22.680
 the presence is no longer very strange 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:26.190
 these antennas right here and the most 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:29.370
 interesting is a symbol of what has 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.170
 below here but everyone has 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.080
 knows that the bottom and 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.880
 represents exactly the location where 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.800
 the flying saucer appears 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:42.930
 when you complete 100% of the game everything 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.850
 very strange no 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.640
 Good, I hope you liked it. 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:49.920
 this video is the first part 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.390
 Yes, I'm waiting for you here at 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.010
 next video thank you very much to all 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.780
 issues that the latter share 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.780
 Thank you and it was
