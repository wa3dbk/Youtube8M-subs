very early in pre-production carrillo we
didn't<00:00:09.940> have<00:00:10.150> the<00:00:10.780> bad<00:00:11.050> human<00:00:11.710> Marcel<00:00:12.219> he<00:00:12.400> was

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.110 
so I was boring from that a lot as well
uh<00:01:59.770> here<00:02:00.770> Marcel<00:02:01.160> chosen<00:02:01.700> the<00:02:01.940> last

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:02.120 
uh here Marcel chosen the last

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.300 
uh here Marcel chosen the last
assignment<00:02:02.600> and<00:02:02.690> then<00:02:03.110> this<00:02:03.650> was<00:02:03.860> me<00:02:04.040> just

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
assignment and then this was me just

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.359 
assignment and then this was me just
testing<00:02:04.970> how<00:02:05.180> like<00:02:05.869> okay<00:02:06.470> that<00:02:06.650> coming<00:02:07.010> in<00:02:07.190> the

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 
testing how like okay that coming in the

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:09.730 
testing how like okay that coming in the
flying<00:02:07.610> in<00:02:07.760> was<00:02:07.970> sort<00:02:08.179> of<00:02:08.300> realistic<00:02:09.260> somehow

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
flying in was sort of realistic somehow

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.140 
flying in was sort of realistic somehow
but<00:02:10.010> I<00:02:10.040> wanted<00:02:10.369> to<00:02:10.459> try<00:02:10.640> something<00:02:10.670> more

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
but I wanted to try something more

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.780 
but I wanted to try something more
cartoony<00:02:11.780> for<00:02:12.380> the<00:02:12.470> next<00:02:12.739> section<00:02:13.220> of<00:02:13.340> Nigel's

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
cartoony for the next section of Nigel's

cartoony for the next section of Nigel's
flight<00:02:14.030> so<00:02:14.660> why<00:02:14.810> did<00:02:14.989> this<00:02:15.350> where<00:02:15.739> he<00:02:16.130> pushes

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
flight so why did this where he pushes

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.030 
flight so why did this where he pushes
off<00:02:16.850> and<00:02:17.030> stretches<00:02:17.450> quite<00:02:17.630> a<00:02:17.660> lot<00:02:17.930> and<00:02:18.170> then

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
off and stretches quite a lot and then

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.340 
off and stretches quite a lot and then
there's<00:02:19.250> like<00:02:19.400> a<00:02:19.430> whole<00:02:19.810> like<00:02:20.810> went<00:02:21.020> like<00:02:21.080> this

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
there's like a whole like went like this

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.170 
there's like a whole like went like this
is<00:02:21.470> completely<00:02:21.860> cheated<00:02:22.310> but<00:02:22.820> it's<00:02:23.000> like<00:02:23.150> a

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
is completely cheated but it's like a

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.860 
is completely cheated but it's like a
whole<00:02:23.420> turn<00:02:24.100> and<00:02:25.100> then<00:02:25.910> grabs<00:02:26.390> a<00:02:26.540> thing<00:02:26.720> and

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
whole turn and then grabs a thing and

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.770 
whole turn and then grabs a thing and
just<00:02:26.959> throws<00:02:27.530> it<00:02:27.560> in<00:02:27.800> his<00:02:28.010> lap<00:02:28.250> and<00:02:28.489> and<00:02:28.970> then

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
just throws it in his lap and and then

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.660 
just throws it in his lap and and then
he<00:02:29.930> does<00:02:30.110> this<00:02:30.290> this<00:02:31.100> thing<00:02:31.310> where<00:02:31.489> he's

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
he does this this thing where he's

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.920 
he does this this thing where he's
hovering<00:02:31.910> and<00:02:32.590> screaming<00:02:33.590> and<00:02:34.510> then<00:02:35.510> he<00:02:35.780> does

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
hovering and screaming and then he does

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.620 
hovering and screaming and then he does
that<00:02:36.170> the<00:02:36.950> fly<00:02:37.190> app<00:02:37.340> Kenneth<00:02:37.790> in<00:02:37.970> this<00:02:38.450> was<00:02:38.600> a

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
that the fly app Kenneth in this was a

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.930 
that the fly app Kenneth in this was a
lot<00:02:38.750> of<00:02:38.810> fun<00:02:38.900> is<00:02:39.230> this<00:02:39.489> yeah<00:02:40.489> i<00:02:40.610> don't<00:02:40.730> think<00:02:40.910> i

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
lot of fun is this yeah i don't think i

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.820 
lot of fun is this yeah i don't think i
ever<00:02:40.970> saw<00:02:41.269> this<00:02:41.420> test<00:02:41.720> so<00:02:41.900> he<00:02:42.320> was<00:02:42.470> more<00:02:42.650> like

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
ever saw this test so he was more like

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.000 
ever saw this test so he was more like
pudgy<00:02:43.760> back<00:02:44.000> then<00:02:44.239> right<00:02:44.450> he<00:02:44.630> was<00:02:44.720> wider<00:02:45.050> yes

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
pudgy back then right he was wider yes

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.740 
pudgy back then right he was wider yes
yes<00:02:46.489> definitely<00:02:46.640> this<00:02:46.970> was<00:02:47.150> feel<00:02:47.420> like<00:02:47.570> an

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
yes definitely this was feel like an

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.570 
yes definitely this was feel like an
earlier<00:02:48.230> model<00:02:48.500> it<00:02:48.980> took<00:02:49.130> a<00:02:49.190> little<00:02:49.370> bit<00:02:49.489> of

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
earlier model it took a little bit of

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.370 
earlier model it took a little bit of
back<00:02:49.790> and<00:02:49.940> forth<00:02:50.000> to<00:02:50.360> find<00:02:50.630> his<00:02:50.780> final<00:02:51.110> design

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
back and forth to find his final design

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.560 
back and forth to find his final design
so<00:02:51.590> we<00:02:51.709> used<00:02:51.890> a<00:02:51.980> lot<00:02:52.100> of<00:02:52.220> Sergio's<00:02:52.640> and<00:02:53.269> a<00:02:53.390> lot

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:53.570 
so we used a lot of Sergio's and a lot

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.600 
so we used a lot of Sergio's and a lot
of<00:02:53.600> sanctions<00:02:54.290> decides<00:02:54.739> to<00:02:54.980> come<00:02:55.400> to<00:02:55.550> the

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
of sanctions decides to come to the

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.640 
of sanctions decides to come to the
final<00:02:55.760> model<00:02:56.180> and<00:02:56.360> yeah<00:02:56.989> he<00:02:57.170> was<00:02:57.290> a<00:02:57.320> little<00:02:57.560> bit

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
final model and yeah he was a little bit

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.790 
final model and yeah he was a little bit
but<00:02:58.459> here<00:02:58.760> for<00:02:59.030> sure<00:02:59.180> you<00:03:00.080> know<00:03:00.140> this<00:03:00.320> the

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
but here for sure you know this the

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.800 
but here for sure you know this the
whole<00:03:01.010> process<00:03:01.910> of<00:03:02.420> getting<00:03:02.540> these

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
whole process of getting these

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.750 
whole process of getting these
characters<00:03:03.380> to<00:03:03.680> look<00:03:03.860> the<00:03:04.100> way<00:03:04.130> they<00:03:04.280> do<00:03:04.550> on

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
characters to look the way they do on

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.330 
characters to look the way they do on
screen<00:03:05.150> is<00:03:05.540> so<00:03:05.840> fascinating<00:03:06.200> because<00:03:06.560> you've

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
screen is so fascinating because you've

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.250 
screen is so fascinating because you've
got<00:03:07.519> these<00:03:07.640> great<00:03:08.269> hero<00:03:08.600> designs<00:03:08.930> and<00:03:09.080> then<00:03:09.170> I

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
got these great hero designs and then I

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.830 
got these great hero designs and then I
get<00:03:09.410> modeled<00:03:10.100> in<00:03:10.400> a<00:03:10.700> neutral<00:03:10.940> pose<00:03:11.390> so<00:03:11.750> that

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
get modeled in a neutral pose so that

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.870 
get modeled in a neutral pose so that
they<00:03:11.930> can<00:03:12.110> be<00:03:12.230> properly<00:03:12.620> rigged<00:03:13.040> but<00:03:13.640> that

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
they can be properly rigged but that

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.229 
they can be properly rigged but that
might<00:03:14.420> not<00:03:14.450> get<00:03:14.959> you<00:03:15.079> back<00:03:15.410> to<00:03:16.280> that<00:03:16.310> optimal

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
might not get you back to that optimal

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.380 
might not get you back to that optimal
look<00:03:17.900> and<00:03:18.200> so<00:03:18.380> this<00:03:18.590> process<00:03:19.190> here<00:03:19.489> is<00:03:19.609> huge

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
look and so this process here is huge

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.300 
look and so this process here is huge
important<00:03:20.900> to<00:03:21.020> get<00:03:21.260> in<00:03:21.350> a<00:03:21.440> character<00:03:21.590> be

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
important to get in a character be

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.010 
important to get in a character be
appealing<00:03:22.910> trying<00:03:23.210> to<00:03:23.300> find<00:03:23.510> the<00:03:23.630> character

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.020 
appealing trying to find the character

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:28.720 
appealing trying to find the character
right<00:03:24.950> right<00:03:25.480> so<00:03:26.480> through
