00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.230
 Hello everyone, credit is your sixth 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:19.029
 Part of disassembling my mechanical house 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.980
 versions minecraft 1 5 2 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.500
 and today i will show you enough 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.029
 interesting mechanism this mechanism 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:29.169
 was in the warehouse of this mechanical 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:32.160
 at home and let's click on the button and 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:34.480
 semi blocks are removed and appear 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.090
 steps in which we can go down 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.670
 down and take some items 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.859
 for example here and here there will be a ceiling 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.429
 is there some chest or something else 

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:47.140
 anything and the mechanism is enough 

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:52.050
 compact ie there are no 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.050
 bulging parts here's what it looks like and 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:58.629
 when you press this button again 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:01.030
 let's click on it everything happens in 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:04.120
 reverse order that is where was the passage 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.940
 blocks appeared and everything 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:09.850
 quite muddled and let's build 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.830
 this mechanism began to build 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.630
 the usual the trigger I think all of it 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:17.740
 know but if anyone knows 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:22.360
 do as I continue to put 5 pieces 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:26.980
 of the diet like this 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:29.580
 here and gave here 3 repeater to the full 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.580
 the delay 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.890
 and then you need to connect these three 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:38.229
 repeater and after repeater rescue 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.780
 three blocks on these three blocks 3 red 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:45.190
 torch further 3 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:47.680
 repeater after repeaters can supply 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:51.250
 so three blocks and on them a red torch with 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:54.070
 in blocks, that is, here and now find 3 blocks 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:57.040
 three more red torches and further here 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.920
 need to put 9 sticky pistons here 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:04.750
 in such a way and put here three 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:06.910
 Now the block and still need further hereinafter 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:12.250
 put here on these red torches 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:16.060
 three blocks and let's now put here 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.770
 here here is napalm repeater delay now 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:22.630
 need to put the generator short 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:30.190
 pulses and hold roadstone 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:32.019
 up here in this way though 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.299
 let me first do another part 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:40.030
 mechanism this part of the mechanism is responsible 

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:45.670
 for the first step and set here 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:47.500
 the repeater and so here are four blocks further 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:51.760
 need to do more precisely put here 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:55.120
 redstone here pa peter and here red 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:58.840
 torch and now i'm here a red torch 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.610
 here is a repeater here and a block on it 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.579
 redstone with a red torch 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:08.530
 that is, this is how it should have been 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:12.959
 get further on what to put here 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:17.040
 here the sticky piston here is the usual piston 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:20.560
 on this sticky piston some blog 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:24.700
 from which you will be the floor and gave here 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:27.390
 step and here is an ordinary piston that's what 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:30.750
 you should have been able to 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:33.480
 a and let's do this part more precisely 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:43.290
 let's finish it here two 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:45.330
 pistons on them blocks with ladders like this 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:50.490
 here and now let's check this one 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:55.860
 mechanism put a button here and click 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:04:00.390
 on her and yes everything works let's 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:06.360
 change this ladder to block to 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:10.880
 okay it was all and put here 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.880
 there is still more sticky usually piston and 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:17.700
 let's check the mechanism again click 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:20.040
 on the button and just did not finish something 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:23.330
 let's put here again tom 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:25.200
 barely repeater for full delay and 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.830
 now check already 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:34.190
 click on the button and everything works as 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:34.190
 you see here will be the floor for example 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:40.009
 and I hope you enjoyed this mechanism. 

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:43.400
 because he is really very 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:43.910
 interesting, you can somehow hide your 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.330
 things 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:49.819
 hell griffer well or anything 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:54.199
 come up with interesting with this mechanism 

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:56.449
 you can and that's all thanks to all for 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:59.500
 view put likes subscribe to 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:59.500
