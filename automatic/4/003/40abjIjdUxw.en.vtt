00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:06.509
 for sanding parquet flooring 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.300
 as well as floorboard offered 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.400
 many processing options but in any 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.590
 case of working the same type of machine 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.480
 with today's requirements impossible 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.880
 need a machine for rough handling 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.130
 both new and old from the surface 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.100
 machine is used for this purpose 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.050
 drum or tape type then 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.760
 used surface grinder 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.189
 which aligns all tracks 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.640
 left by previous processing and 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.710
 creates a smooth and smooth surface for 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.290
 processing wall and hard to reach 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.270
 plots under radiators 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.879
 need to use angle 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.020
 grinding machine such an arsenal 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.300
 technology can 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.940
 not every parketchik has a case 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.930
 work in small areas 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.250
 transportation of all this technology 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.230
 creates difficulties 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.100
 since the weight of one drum machine 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.739
 type more than 80 kilograms we present 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.870
 your attention to flat grinding 1 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.510
 disk parquet machine level 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.180
 this is a universal machine that performs everything 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.580
 stages of polishing and finishing parquet and 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.110
 plank flooring total curb weight 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.420
 car forty seven kilograms 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.210
 the machine level is done without 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.610
 the help of other machines since working on 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.250
 large abrasives easy 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.979
 levels differences and deformations of slats 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.840
 and boards for easy transportation 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.880
 control lever is removable in this 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.040
 weight of the machine itself 40 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:33.290
 kilograms powerful built-in vacuum cleaner 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.290
 allows you to collect dust one hundred percent 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.259
 for work it is recommended to use 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.270
 went to the skin of Ukrainian production 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:44.270
 corundum abrasive layer is very dense 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.290
 and well fixed based on 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.540
 making emery discs 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.570
 carried out independently using 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.899
 the cutter on the spacer if u 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.380
 you have no roll material at hand 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:59.910
 use the size you have 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.480
 if the working disk of the machine is covering 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:05.330
 full performance is not lost 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.380
 working disk with a diameter of 300 millimeters 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.240
 fixed elastic coupling 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.090
 it allows you to repeat the relief 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:14.190
 floor surfaces during movements and in 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:28.410
 case of bumps avoid undercutting 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:29.090
 parquet in these places 2 ci from others 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.920
 cars 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.340
 level works in saving mode 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.200
 the strength 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.480
 as when going from side to 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.700
 side of the strip to be processed 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.720
 surface may be more than 100 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:45.000
 centimeters front of the case 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.000
 allows to process wall 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.280
 areas and zones under radiators 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.800
 parquet treatment is also possible with 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.410
 old varnish coating in this case 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.750
 when abrasive properties are lost edges 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.460
 emery disc can be bent inside 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.430
 thereby extend the service life 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.739
 consumable level has such 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.050
 advantage as selective mode 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.540
 grinding is when after rough 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:12.120
 surface treatment remaining 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.700
 drops and bumps can be noted 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.239
 pencil handle separately from the whole 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.239
 plane 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:21.819
 ease of management combined with 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:23.560
 quality supplemented with decent price 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:26.829
 these are just some of the virtues 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.340
 machine level is not just compelling 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:29.469
 replica 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.959
 this car can be your main 

00:03:29.469 --> 00:03:34.239
 a resource in the work because many 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:37.329
 owners of this technology switched to a new 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:39.879
 quality level of work performed if 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:41.859
 you already have any cars then 

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:42.730
 level will adequately complement your arsenal 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:46.139
 technology 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:46.139
 fulfilling its purpose
