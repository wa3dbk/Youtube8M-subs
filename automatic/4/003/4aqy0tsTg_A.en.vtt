00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
purchased and this is just a really

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.010 
purchased and this is just a really
gorgeous<00:00:44.129> like<00:00:44.610> true<00:00:45.000> orange<00:00:45.539> with<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.809> hot

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
pink shimmer slash flash I think it's

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.720 
pink shimmer slash flash I think it's
more<00:00:49.410> of<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.590> flash<00:00:49.800> than<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.100> shimmer<00:00:50.430> but<00:00:50.550> it's

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
more of a flash than a shimmer but it's

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.220 
more of a flash than a shimmer but it's

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
your popsicle which is much more of a

your popsicle which is much more of a
true<00:01:03.180> orange<00:01:03.629> Beyond<00:01:03.960> but<00:01:04.170> I<00:01:04.229> don't<00:01:04.439> really

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
true orange Beyond but I don't really

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.530 
true orange Beyond but I don't really
like<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:05.070> way<00:01:05.220> that<00:01:05.250> those<00:01:06.000> kind<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.360> colors

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
like the way that those kind of colors

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.289 
like the way that those kind of colors
look<00:01:06.840> on<00:01:06.990> my<00:01:07.140> skin<00:01:07.500> as<00:01:07.710> much<00:01:08.070> as<00:01:08.700> this<00:01:09.000> which<00:01:09.270> is

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
look on my skin as much as this which is

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.630 
look on my skin as much as this which is
more<00:01:09.540> of<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.750> yellow<00:01:09.960> orange<00:01:10.409> so<00:01:10.979> this<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.460> one

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
more of a yellow orange so this is one

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.250 
more of a yellow orange so this is one
that<00:01:11.850> does<00:01:12.060> have<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.360> be<00:01:12.450> layered<00:01:12.659> over<00:01:12.840> white

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
that does have to be layered over white

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.380 
that does have to be layered over white
because<00:01:13.590> it<00:01:13.710> is<00:01:13.830> like<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.100> true<00:01:14.490> neon<00:01:14.939> so<00:01:15.299> it

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
because it is like a true neon so it

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.660 
because it is like a true neon so it
dries<00:01:15.600> matte<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.170> is<00:01:16.650> kind<00:01:17.040> of<00:01:17.130> sheer<00:01:17.369> on<00:01:17.520> its

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
dries matte and is kind of sheer on its

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.130 
dries matte and is kind of sheer on its
own<00:01:17.790> but<00:01:17.909> if<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.090> layer<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.390> over<00:01:18.720> white<00:01:18.869> it'll

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
own but if you layer it over white it'll

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.749 
own but if you layer it over white it'll
get<00:01:19.259> like<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.530> exact<00:01:19.890> color<00:01:20.159> in<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.460> bottle

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
get like the exact color in the bottle

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.130 
get like the exact color in the bottle
and<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:21.299> won't<00:01:21.450> have<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.689> have<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.840> ton<00:01:22.110> of

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
and you won't have to have a ton of

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.499 
and you won't have to have a ton of
coats<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.619> do<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:22.890> this<00:01:23.460> came<00:01:23.850> out<00:01:24.000> in<00:01:24.450> the

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
coats to do it this came out in the

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.350 
coats to do it this came out in the
poolside<00:01:25.409> collection<00:01:26.159> which<00:01:26.490> was<00:01:26.790> quite<00:01:27.270> a

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
poolside collection which was quite a

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.990 
poolside collection which was quite a
few<00:01:27.509> years<00:01:27.659> ago<00:01:28.250> but<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.430> can<00:01:29.610> find<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:29.909> on
