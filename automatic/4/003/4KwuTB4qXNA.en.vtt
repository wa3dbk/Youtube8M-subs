00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.700
 but what we do in all the videos is 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.870
 blur the shadows is super 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.820
 important is what makes your 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.439
 makeup looks really professional 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.470
 but we have never gone into details 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:23.449
 on how to blur the shadows on a 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.070
 and asked us through youtube how 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:26.390
 you can blur the shadows and for 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.400
 that in this video tutorial les 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.910
 we will teach two different ways about 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.910
 how to do it 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:36.620
 First let's talk about what you should not do 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.950
 such is something that you are doing now without 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.950
 to realize 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.930
 when you apply your men is very 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.420
 important the type of applicator brush 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.580
 that you use trying to use one that 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.680
 be very thin that has the bristles or 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.750
 the experts very close together because that's going to 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.670
 be practically impossible 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.500
 blur your shadows because the shadows 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.250
 it is not going to be able to move and therefore 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.260
 fade 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.989
 What you want to avoid is having a line 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.820
 strong color that looks where it ends 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.860
 the color like you can see that the color 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.080
 ends in one place and then another 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.240
 that there is simply skin is that your 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.220
 works is not blurred as I have 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.619
 there they see how the colors look very 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.659
 separated by blocks that is ugly 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:20.729
 that's what you do not want to do 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.469
 the number one method is what we call 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.219
 fifty and fifty because you're going to 

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:24.749
 Apply 

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:28.259
 your two all you want to blur 

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:30.000
 in equal amounts 50 and 50 in this 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.590
 case we are going to use the astolfo paddle 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.200
 cloud in the mind and we will use 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.299
 to show the blue tones I'm going to 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.369
 take first the brightest blue and 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.689
 then apply in my eye concentrating the 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.429
 color because I want it to look very 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.649
 striking and for that I'm applying 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:44.880
 mute haditas this has nothing to do 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.380
 with blur but if I want 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.030
 show them how the 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.170
 colors when they are blurred I want 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.170
 that are well strong 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.100
 now he's going to apply the darker blue and 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.500
 I'm applying it like a sponge 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.740
 these are not ideal instruments for 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.740
 blur 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.970
 now let's blur what is ideal is that 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.010
 use brushes that have little hairs 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.710
 well separated because this will allow 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.840
 that the shadows move between their hairs 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.850
 and diffuse or go away from 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.560
 Lead giving the darker color because 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.050
 it will not be so compact and it has 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.790
 joining the rest 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.380
 to blur with a brush the 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.630
 movement that you have to do is 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.360
 simply circulitos circulitos 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.780
 Circulitos and go over the course of 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.060
 is your color 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.390
 the idea is that it works is your color 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.500
 dark with the clear and that basically 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:48.720
 disappear the line that looks so 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.720
 strong creating a medium color 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:54.209
 this method may seem simple but 

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:56.069
 it requires some practice and patience if 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.829
 I was on to make up your best test 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.780
 method 2 in this we use layers of 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:02.519
 color and first we blur one and then 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.019
 the other one and that's how we're ready 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.310
 makeup 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:07.379
 I'm going to start with the dark color 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.750
 but it does not matter what you start may be 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:11.430
 clear or the dark you want to create the shape 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.650
 which will more or less have your makeup 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.209
 and this you can do with an applicator 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.859
 of those who normally bring the pallets 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.870
 and once you have that ready even 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:20.760
 You can start doing circles with 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.980
 your applicator and that's going to make it 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.269
 softens a little that shade is much more 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.379
 easy because you're only working 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.379
 with a color 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.819
 equally if you have a brush by hand 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.170
 you can finish blurring the rest of 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:41.560
 the shadow with the same movements 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:45.390
 circulitos circulitos and following the 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.390
 line you created is for your makeup 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.100
 and see how this look looks 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.200
 it could look good like this only without using 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.910
 the other light blue but let's 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.550
 apply it to see how it would fade 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:04.200
 then apply the same concentrating 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.730
 quite the color and then I want 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.650
 blur light blue with blue 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.260
 dark simply blurring as already 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.640
 You know how to do it right where second so 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.860
 that those are the techniques to blur 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.300
 I hope you apply it in all your 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.590
 other makeups and then for the 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.590
 next chao
