a mall tops and you can see there's a
little<00:02:25.280> hazards<00:02:25.880> like<00:02:26.120> these<00:02:26.360> firecrackers

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
little hazards like these firecrackers

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:35.320 
little hazards like these firecrackers
but<00:02:30.050> overall<00:02:30.350> it's<00:02:30.770> just<00:02:33.310> it's<00:02:34.310> a<00:02:34.490> decent<00:02:35.060> game

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
but overall it's just it's a decent game

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.630 
but overall it's just it's a decent game
like<00:02:35.750> for<00:02:36.320> ten<00:02:36.560> bucks<00:02:36.830> it's<00:02:37.160> not<00:02:37.370> bad<00:02:37.750> but<00:02:38.750> uh<00:02:38.810> I

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
like for ten bucks it's not bad but uh I

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.580 
like for ten bucks it's not bad but uh I
suggest<00:02:40.640> going<00:02:40.970> with<00:02:41.210> a<00:02:41.240> different<00:02:41.510> game<00:02:42.110> like

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
suggest going with a different game like

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.430 
suggest going with a different game like
off<00:02:43.130> the<00:02:43.190> PS<00:02:43.700> and<00:02:43.940> go<00:02:44.090> for<00:02:44.360> a<00:02:44.390> real<00:02:44.690> zombie<00:02:45.050> game

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
off the PS and go for a real zombie game

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.250 
off the PS and go for a real zombie game
like<00:02:45.709> a<00:02:46.150> resident<00:02:47.150> evil<00:02:47.480> or<00:02:47.630> something<00:02:48.110> like

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
like a resident evil or something like

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.830 
like a resident evil or something like
that<00:02:48.320> or<00:02:49.190> just<00:02:49.220> get<00:02:49.520> silent<00:02:50.030> who<00:02:50.180> i<00:02:50.240> recommend

Silent Hill strongly even though that's

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.690 
Silent Hill strongly even though that's
not<00:02:54.080> really<00:02:54.350> zombies<00:02:54.860> but<00:02:55.070> it<00:02:55.400> certainly

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
not really zombies but it certainly

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.870 
not really zombies but it certainly

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
wasn't laggy and I probably would give

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.800 
wasn't laggy and I probably would give
it<00:03:38.670> a<00:03:38.730> little<00:03:38.880> higher<00:03:39.150> of<00:03:39.390> the<00:03:39.480> score<00:03:40.190> but<00:03:41.190> uh
