00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:24.619
 hello youtube hello viewers and 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:29.750
 my channel followers thecus reviews 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:34.140
 Today I want to show how to braid 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:36.750
 knife handle that is but this 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:42.270
 dostochki it will be with us imitation beds 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.400
 the knife here is the beginning and the holes are usually 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.020
 it happens 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:53.640
 knife handles for finishing 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:57.690
 Today I will show how to braid pretty 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:03.000
 the easiest way is to weave into one 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:10.729
 loop for this you need to fold a piece 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:13.729
 paracord fold in half and secure 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:13.729
 the usual 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:35.180
 body fixed 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:46.060
 then turn it over and tie it up 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:49.060
 same single will be like this again 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.060
 turn over 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:19.440
 knot overturn tying and 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.030
 beat for it to be 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:39.630
 plump 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:39.630
 good again nodule coup 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:51.510
 5 stalks need to follow to 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:54.440
 paracord lay down exactly 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.440
 twisted 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:14.130
 we break up again we turn over 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:20.090
 again, even the knot is important that all nodes 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:22.470
 knitted in one direction that is 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:26.660
 if the left branch 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:29.540
 lays down on top of right and so 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:34.230
 tie a knot then it should be 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:35.700
 svida throughout weaving then 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.610
 is if we turned 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:44.930
 then we still put the right branch 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:44.930
 top 0 and so here we tie a knot 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:04:03.579
 two days drag on them further 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:42.889
 I must say that this way you can 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:45.360
 braid not only our pen but also any 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:52.100
 the handle of any instrument that is 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:59.389
 I deal there ax hammer because what 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:59.389
 besides lunar instruments 

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:11.240
 but also my piece of parkour until ended then 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:17.600
 I will not continue to do so I 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:17.600
 show in this way 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:30.550
 it turns out 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:37.570
 problems this doctrine 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:37.570
 good ton of life 

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:46.750
 on this for now bye
