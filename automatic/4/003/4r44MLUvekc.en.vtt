00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.540
 well then that's everyone that's Auxerre 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.860
 and today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:30.870
 new video on which russia 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.669
 blackhawks 2 so as you had to the 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.020
 see I propose this video to coast that 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.850
 i have and cf codes of strings 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.780
 super cool community so I 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.600
 will put the link of their strings in 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.190
 registration is so I think the 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.660
 subject and gameplay are enough 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.400
 attractive to pass on this chain 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.200
 so that's why I offer them 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.580
 so yes so let's talk about the gameplay 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.290
 introducing the gameplay first so 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.540
 it is a demolition of cargo by 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.370
 twinner so a guy from my team this is a 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.629
 nuclear attempt so I you do not you 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.310
 say no more if they want to succeed or 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.140
 not I'm just telling you he's going to make a 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.640
 good big score but after I do not tell you 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.130
 not if he will be loaned one who the 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.820
 sells or even 20 universe that he I do not 

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:07.160
 do not say I let you guess appreciated 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.200
 the gameplay that is I think 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.729
 good enough on one of his best 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.720
 gameplay finally have maybe not it's 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.850
 not his best score but it's one of 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.220
 these miners gameplay so because now 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.979
 I will rather talk to you about my subject 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.970
 so who I think is pretty interesting 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.570
 who will you probably do us 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.000
 reflect 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.440
 so the subject is the following 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.600
 goals a franchise that becomes of 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.160
 more and more mediatized so among others 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.830
 I will tell you about the evolution of 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.539
 call of duty and other little things 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.520
 and I will let you think about this 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:38.069
 subject so I think you have it 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.890
 noticed right now since black ops 2 

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:42.179
 we receive an avalanche of trailer so 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.160
 we had in-game trailers 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:44.910
 hirel thrillers so I do not know if 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.259
 that shocks you 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.810
 but personally I find that 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.390
 treyarch offers us a lot of 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.509
 trailer is so I think the goal 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.819
 to have that to acquire the 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.170
 player satisfaction call of duty 

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:59.340
 is the second goal finally I do not know if 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.500
 this is the second goal where the goal 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.240
 principal is of course to harvest 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.009
 money so among other things we can say 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.229
 that call of duty a wad the skull 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.539
 excuse me for that term but I have not 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.959
 found more more more softer we are going 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:15.780
 to say to say what I think so 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.459
 we had trailer bedding yesterday she 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.020
 before his release to help him trailer the 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.560
 campaign the zombie voters for 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.170
 each map 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.970
 we are from the trailer of the multi we had two 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.770
 conducted two very long multichoices we have 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.660
 had some trailer a little bit in the 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.870
 global call of duty have bequeathed trailer 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.540
 dlc 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.760
 the irl brothers dlc so I'm going to you 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.379
 speak first to a little more dlc on 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.150
 do not remember that on mw3 excuse me 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:39.459
 to confront these two games that do not 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.000
 do not look like at all a little 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.620
 not very much 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.640
 we will say that call of duty is a 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.260
 little bit repetitive but good why 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.500
 we 're not going to start debating there 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.930
 above 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.230
 so I settled in blue 3 we are 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.909
 as many dlc I do not remember known 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.420
 too much dlc rl i do not remember having 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:59.019
 seen too much of dlc for each map 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:01.989
 dlc and so I tell myself that these 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:04.620
 questions what life ghost and will have 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:07.599
 even more and that it does not follow that 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:10.629
 it makes me a little scared to see that 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:11.590
 we have more and more dlc already sure I 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:13.239
 you speak a little bit of love and 2 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.890
 nothing is not a lot of help from 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.049
 thrillers at the same time as youtube 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.120
 was not very well known a tube that it has 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:19.590
 began to evolve from black up 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.819
 franck 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:24.340
 so here I am playing line to be like that 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:25.359
 but hey I do not really know 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.220
 that we are maybe less two dlc 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:28.359
 but there since since since dishes 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.090
 as you really have a lot 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:32.620
 a lot a lot and I 'm not saying 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.269
 that to denigrate me because after the 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:36.130
 maps of the del sol are really great and 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:37.209
 malema prison bush simply 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:42.849
 huge 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:44.260
 but hey it's true that ben that I 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:46.209
 find that there is really still 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.569
 really a lot of trailer and that it 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:50.859
 can it finally shock us 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:52.870
 personally it shocked me so I 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:54.280
 invite you first told a small 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.569
 little the trailer name that is on the 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.069
 common to me I have no time to 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:58.690
 count but I think she really 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:00.879
 a lot in my head the agent I think 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.129
 France she really has a lot 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:05.169
 and so I invite you to count them 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:06.220
 masters the number of women in the 

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:07.780
 comments no I'm kidding you have 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:12.010
 not to find all the traits of all 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:14.560
 the trailer but well here I say no I 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.739
 do not say that to be mean but I 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.859
 think traders are the main 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:22.240
 idea of calvi to raise money 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.820
 because now I'm going back a little 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.340
 more in the details and you talk about 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.639
 weapon camouflage paying on this new 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.310
 opus 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:33.039
 so as you must have noticed 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.599
 had paid camouflage so I 

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:35.620
 find it already completely a little bit 

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:37.630
 seedy 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.400
 to charge for camouflage one by one 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.970
 montea limits already make pay for 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.400
 camouflage 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.500
 it's a little bit you can not nice and 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.479
 a parent and camouflage ah yes of 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.370
 camouflage and directx camouflage and 

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:50.530
 setbacks parent paid a lot 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.780
 camouflage +3 ridiculous more there is 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.070
 nine like that so that's still a 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.979
 little bit to raise money 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.750
 and personally I bought and that 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:04:59.680
 walk finally I do not know me I I 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.300
 I had been told that I was not going to buy them 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.440
 and finally I bought them and is 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.389
 in fact I tell myself that I'm not the 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.070
 alone as in the beech to be in this 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:07.930
 case I saw particular big tubes 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:09.400
 hours buy them a time it's 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.710
 normal because he wants to do it 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.940
 discover a little bit to their subscribers 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:15.039
 downloadable content 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:19.330
 but I think it's a small 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:21.789
 little grotesque and charge of 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:24.310
 camouflage one by one and the worst it's 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:26.289
 to make trailers for again if 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.970
 never have we missed that which is what puts me 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:29.350
 already a message to the home but a 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:30.639
 trailer for what we still want 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:31.500
 to buy his camouflage and that's 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:33.880
 ridiculous 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.780
 and here I find it a little bit a 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.000
 little stupid 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:39.250
 finally personally I have been 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.180
 stupid by buying them on Thursday you say 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.410
 I do not say that you too have 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.639
 bought you are stupid because 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:44.650
 maybe you use them more than 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:46.450
 me I was almost never I 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.979
 say I spent 5 euros while 5 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:49.570
 Euro tell you you is that it's going slab 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:52.360
 5 euros but hey it's still already 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:53.770
 a certain amount of money that not everything 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:57.190
 the world can afford to have everything 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:59.110
 the time and that's it and I think and I 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:00.760
 think with everything all the money 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:02.080
 all all the camouflages 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.950
 that they have during they said really 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.289
 make a lot of money 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:06.699
 I think I do not have how many players 

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:08.440
 who the call of duty but maybe well 

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:09.250
 the third maybe I'm finally 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.470
 now maybe not the shot the 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:12.550
 5th tile who had to buy his 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:14.770
 camouflage and it's still 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:17.889
 really really a lot of people 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:19.150
 who had to buy his camouflage and that 

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:20.110
 still makes them a lot of money but 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:20.919
 good at the same time they do not deserve they 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:22.810
 make good games anyway 

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:25.030
 personally but hey I think it's 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:26.710
 a little bit of abuse to finish i'll you 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:27.160
 invite to think about all that I 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.020
 want to tell you 

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:31.270
 I hope that like in tariff you liked 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:33.220
 and so the gameplay will soon come to an end 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:35.349
 I invite you to put a I like on the 

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:37.389
 video and about the lives of others 

00:06:35.349 --> 00:06:38.380
 co-accused if I pass on the subject if 

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:39.750
 you really did not like the 

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:42.720
 comment and subject 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:44.160
 the gameplay I invite you to go 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.720
 put a record but on my channel 

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:48.440
 because i do not think qg code 

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:50.760
 emeritus or dislike been Kotcheff Méritein 

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:54.060
 with the good videos that we 

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:55.320
 choose and so here is go on 

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:57.180
 my channel I prefer that you go 

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:58.740
 put a live on my channel so the 

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:59.430
 video the video and soon be completed whose
