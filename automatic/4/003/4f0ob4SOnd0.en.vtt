 It is a systemic one to work together 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.060
 Then complete some of the actions the coach gave you. 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.440
 First introduce the first action to you. 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.980
 Bobby is deeper and jumps 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.140
 First of all, let’s face the pedal first. 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.940
 Make a deep preparatory action first 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.540
 Then both feet jump up at the same time 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.940
 Jump up and then jump down to the ground with your feet down 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.420
 Kneeling down and then kicking the foot at the same time 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.920
 Then take both feet back at the same time 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.720
 At the beginning of this position 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.200
 Then the part of its training is in this 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.320
 This quadriceps gluteus maximus 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.200
 And the back muscles of our legs 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.200
 Next we have this action, it is 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.200
 Bow and arrow presses sandbags 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.200
 First of all, facing the sandbags 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.960
 Then put your hands straight on the sandbags 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.020
 Homeopathy, a big step forward 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.060
 Bowing and bending, then the foot is bent and then the foot is raised 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.600

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.780
 Then go back to the original location 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.140
 Then change the foot next 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.940
 Then what is the main training part? 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.000
 Is our quadriceps and our gluteus maximus 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.700
 And our abdominal core plus our triceps 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.140
 The next move is a deep twist. 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.960
 First of all, let’s hold our long bar first. 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.200

 Please move the bar to the side of your body. 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.320
 Then take advantage of the trend to do deep movements 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.320
 Then when I return to the original position 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.840
 After pushing both hands up, push the bar up 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.820

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.840
 Then the main training part is apart from our lower body muscles. 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.300
 The focus is on the strength of our abdominal core 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.660
 That's the muscles of our arms and shoulders. 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:08.080

 Then first face the rope and then sit in a sitting position 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.680
 Then grasp the rope with both hands 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.580
 During the movement, both hands pull up and down 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.480
 Then take the body and slowly pull it up. 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.920
 Pay attention to your core stability during the pulling process. 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.440
 And the rhythm of your breathing 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.280
 Then pull until our body is completely straight 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.720

 The body moves to your side 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.400
 Then catch our so-called medicine ball and throw it in the direction of the chest. 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.780
 The time to repeat is about one minute. 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.000

 Then the body is in a prone position and then the feet are straight 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.920
 The abdomen core lifts the body 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.140
 Before the action started, the hands were slightly straightened. 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.880
 In the course of the action, do the boating 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.140
