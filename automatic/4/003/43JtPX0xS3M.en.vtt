and the microphone jet our whole as well

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.950 
and the microphone jet our whole as well
so<00:02:10.039> with<00:02:10.550> that<00:02:10.670> said<00:02:11.090> you<00:02:11.300> get<00:02:11.480> a<00:02:11.510> really<00:02:11.840> high

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
so with that said you get a really high

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.810 
so with that said you get a really high
quality<00:02:11.990> leather<00:02:12.560> case<00:02:12.920> and<00:02:13.220> i'm<00:02:13.550> comparing

this really to the

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.220 
this really to the
apple<00:02:15.700> case<00:02:15.880> that<00:02:16.270> will<00:02:16.390> retail<00:02:16.780> believe<00:02:17.080> it's

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
apple case that will retail believe it's

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.760 
apple case that will retail believe it's
49<00:02:17.620> 99<00:02:17.890> I<00:02:18.490> really<00:02:19.210> like<00:02:19.390> this<00:02:19.630> it<00:02:20.410> does<00:02:20.620> have

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
49 99 I really like this it does have

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.980 
49 99 I really like this it does have
functionality<00:02:21.220> I'm<00:02:21.520> like<00:02:21.670> the<00:02:21.910> flap<00:02:22.330> or<00:02:22.810> the

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
functionality I'm like the flap or the

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:24.690 
functionality I'm like the flap or the
cover<00:02:23.320> is<00:02:23.590> a<00:02:23.620> bit<00:02:23.890> different<00:02:24.130> than<00:02:24.370> smart

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
cover is a bit different than smart

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:25.740 
cover is a bit different than smart
cover<00:02:24.910> it<00:02:25.060> does<00:02:25.210> take<00:02:25.360> a<00:02:25.390> little<00:02:25.510> bit<00:02:25.690> of

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
cover it does take a little bit of

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.840 
cover it does take a little bit of
working<00:02:26.170> to<00:02:26.290> get<00:02:26.380> it<00:02:26.500> into<00:02:26.620> position<00:02:26.860> but<00:02:27.760> as

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
working to get it into position but as

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:29.760 
working to get it into position but as
you<00:02:27.940> can<00:02:28.000> see<00:02:28.180> here<00:02:28.360> here's<00:02:28.600> one<00:02:28.870> ideal<00:02:29.560> this

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
you can see here here's one ideal this

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.520 
you can see here here's one ideal this
is<00:02:29.890> primarily<00:02:30.250> for<00:02:30.610> typing<00:02:31.060> I<00:02:31.210> use<00:02:31.930> it<00:02:32.110> in<00:02:32.140> this

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
a bunch of bounce I wouldn't really

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.080 
a bunch of bounce I wouldn't really
recommend<00:02:40.120> it<00:02:40.810> but<00:02:41.620> it<00:02:42.550> does<00:02:42.730> keep<00:02:42.910> the

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
had a good look to it and I thought it

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.280 
had a good look to it and I thought it
functioned<00:02:54.490> very<00:02:54.670> well<00:02:54.880> for<00:02:55.120> me<00:02:55.300> so<00:02:55.510> as<00:02:56.170> you
