a demand standpoint I don't really see

a demand standpoint I don't really see
any<00:03:25.480> reason<00:03:25.990> to<00:03:26.530> believe<00:03:26.680> that<00:03:26.950> demand<00:03:27.700> will

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
any reason to believe that demand will

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.470 
any reason to believe that demand will
naturally<00:03:28.500> decrease<00:03:29.500> from<00:03:29.800> here<00:03:30.070> you<00:03:30.940> see<00:03:31.150> the

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
naturally decrease from here you see the

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.860 
naturally decrease from here you see the
demand<00:03:32.190> however<00:03:33.190> will<00:03:33.610> be<00:03:33.640> very<00:03:34.090> much<00:03:34.270> tied<00:03:34.570> to

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
demand however will be very much tied to

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.640 
demand however will be very much tied to
the<00:03:35.500> value<00:03:35.890> of<00:03:36.340> the<00:03:36.730> product<00:03:37.240> being<00:03:37.450> sold<00:03:37.650> the

the value of the product being sold the

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.130 
the value of the product being sold the
only<00:03:38.950> scenario<00:03:39.130> I<00:03:39.460> see<00:03:39.880> where<00:03:40.150> demand<00:03:40.420> dies<00:03:40.720> is

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
only scenario I see where demand dies is

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.650 
only scenario I see where demand dies is
if<00:03:41.710> the<00:03:42.070> inventory<00:03:42.640> levels<00:03:43.090> increased

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
sharply in a very short amount of time

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.090 
sharply in a very short amount of time
which<00:03:46.630> will<00:03:46.870> result<00:03:47.200> in<00:03:47.410> median<00:03:47.830> price

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
which will result in median price

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.880 
which will result in median price
decreases<00:03:48.840> some<00:03:49.840> buyers<00:03:50.080> could<00:03:50.440> get<00:03:50.590> skittish

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
decreases some buyers could get skittish

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.970

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
and retreat into a holding pattern you

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.620 
and retreat into a holding pattern you
see<00:03:54.040> the<00:03:54.310> more<00:03:54.490> buyers<00:03:54.730> that<00:03:55.090> refuse<00:03:55.480> to

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
see the more buyers that refuse to

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.930 
see the more buyers that refuse to
purchase<00:03:56.080> the<00:03:56.710> more<00:03:56.950> the<00:03:57.070> prices<00:03:57.460> actually<00:03:57.610> go

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
purchase the more the prices actually go

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.910 
purchase the more the prices actually go
down<00:03:58.120> and<00:03:58.480> from<00:03:58.840> there<00:03:59.050> it<00:03:59.290> just<00:03:59.320> becomes<00:03:59.770> a

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
down and from there it just becomes a

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.430 
down and from there it just becomes a
self-fulfilling<00:04:00.310> prophecy<00:04:01.090> so<00:04:02.050> let's<00:04:02.230> tie

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
self-fulfilling prophecy so let's tie

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.560 
self-fulfilling prophecy so let's tie
this<00:04:02.500> up<00:04:02.860> this<00:04:03.670> whole<00:04:03.850> housing<00:04:04.240> bubble<00:04:04.450> issue

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
overall my concern is for what happens

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.020

00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:38.559 
I think the market will continue to just
even

00:06:38.559 --> 00:06:38.569

00:06:46.389 --> 00:06:46.399 
market has to come back down at some

00:06:46.399 --> 00:06:49.449 
market has to come back down at some
