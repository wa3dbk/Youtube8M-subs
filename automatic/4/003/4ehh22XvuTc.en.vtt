00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
color scheme but I really don't care for

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.299 
color scheme but I really don't care for
any<00:01:01.929> of<00:01:02.019> those<00:01:02.230> so<00:01:02.559> I'm<00:01:02.710> going<00:01:02.890> to<00:01:02.949> make<00:01:03.280> sure

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
any of those so I'm going to make sure

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:06.710 
any of those so I'm going to make sure
that<00:01:03.579> I<00:01:03.640> revert<00:01:03.999> back<00:01:04.150> to<00:01:04.330> the<00:01:04.420> original<00:01:04.620> and

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
that I revert back to the original and

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.060 
that I revert back to the original and
then<00:01:07.720> I'm<00:01:07.869> going<00:01:07.990> to<00:01:08.020> go<00:01:08.170> down<00:01:08.560> to<00:01:08.770> photo

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
then I'm going to go down to photo

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.609 
then I'm going to go down to photo
enhance<00:01:09.520> and<00:01:09.909> you<00:01:10.750> can<00:01:10.900> see<00:01:11.079> again<00:01:11.320> that<00:01:11.530> we

enhance and you can see again that we

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:13.350 
enhance and you can see again that we
have<00:01:11.799> some<00:01:12.009> presets<00:01:12.490> already<00:01:12.850> set<00:01:13.060> up<00:01:13.090> for

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
have some presets already set up for

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
black and white darkened color shift we

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.380 
black and white darkened color shift we
can<00:01:16.390> do<00:01:16.450> all<00:01:16.570> sorts<00:01:16.930> of<00:01:17.049> wonderful<00:01:17.560> things<00:01:18.390> but

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
can do all sorts of wonderful things but

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.880 
can do all sorts of wonderful things but
I<00:01:19.450> like<00:01:19.659> having<00:01:19.960> a<00:01:20.020> little<00:01:20.290> bit<00:01:20.530> of<00:01:20.590> control

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
I like having a little bit of control

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.999 
I like having a little bit of control
with<00:01:21.189> two<00:01:21.369> areas<00:01:21.820> if<00:01:22.420> we<00:01:22.810> take<00:01:22.990> our<00:01:23.140> saturation

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:24.009 
with two areas if we take our saturation

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:26.160 
with two areas if we take our saturation
field<00:01:24.189> up<00:01:24.549> just<00:01:24.880> a<00:01:25.000> little<00:01:25.030> higher<00:01:25.240> it's

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
field up just a little higher it's

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.020 
field up just a little higher it's
giving<00:01:26.500> you<00:01:26.590> a<00:01:26.619> little<00:01:26.829> bit<00:01:27.009> of<00:01:27.159> a<00:01:27.579> punch<00:01:27.820> of

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
giving you a little bit of a punch of

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.660 
giving you a little bit of a punch of
color<00:01:28.090> and<00:01:28.570> adding<00:01:28.840> saturation<00:01:29.590> or<00:01:29.950> chroma<00:01:30.549> to

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
color and adding saturation or chroma to

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.240 
color and adding saturation or chroma to
your<00:01:30.790> image<00:01:31.060> and<00:01:31.360> then<00:01:32.290> if<00:01:32.409> we<00:01:32.500> take<00:01:32.710> our<00:01:32.860> smart

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
your image and then if we take our smart

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.490 
your image and then if we take our smart
blur<00:01:33.460> up<00:01:33.670> a<00:01:33.850> little<00:01:34.240> tiny<00:01:34.659> bit<00:01:34.960> that's<00:01:35.350> gonna

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
blur up a little tiny bit that's gonna

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.469 
blur up a little tiny bit that's gonna
blur<00:01:35.829> out<00:01:36.040> some<00:01:36.340> of<00:01:36.430> our<00:01:36.520> photographic<00:01:37.000> pixels

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:37.479 
blur out some of our photographic pixels

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:39.870 
blur out some of our photographic pixels
if<00:01:38.200> I<00:01:38.320> take<00:01:38.530> it<00:01:38.649> up<00:01:38.740> drastically<00:01:39.280> you'll<00:01:39.759> be

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
if I take it up drastically you'll be

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.969 
if I take it up drastically you'll be
able<00:01:39.969> to<00:01:40.090> see<00:01:40.270> the<00:01:40.390> effect<00:01:43.530> so<00:01:44.530> you<00:01:44.560> can<00:01:44.799> see

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
able to see the effect so you can see

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:46.560 
able to see the effect so you can see
it's<00:01:45.130> kind<00:01:45.369> of<00:01:45.430> blurred<00:01:45.670> everything<00:01:46.090> out<00:01:46.240> it's

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
it's kind of blurred everything out it's

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.120 
it's kind of blurred everything out it's
already<00:01:46.719> lived<00:01:47.140> looks<00:01:47.530> like<00:01:47.710> it's<00:01:47.860> given<00:01:48.100> a

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 
already lived looks like it's given a

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.010 
already lived looks like it's given a
little<00:01:48.250> bit<00:01:48.430> of<00:01:48.490> a<00:01:48.549> watercolor<00:01:48.909> effect<00:01:49.299> but

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
little bit of a watercolor effect but

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.510 
little bit of a watercolor effect but
that's<00:01:50.170> a<00:01:50.350> bit<00:01:50.530> too<00:01:50.740> high<00:01:50.920> so<00:01:51.219> I'm<00:01:51.310> going<00:01:51.460> to

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
that's a bit too high so I'm going to

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.370 
that's a bit too high so I'm going to
dial<00:01:51.700> down<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:54.729> just<00:01:55.329> have<00:01:55.479> a<00:01:55.509> little<00:01:55.899> bit<00:01:56.259> of

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
dial down and just have a little bit of

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.099 
dial down and just have a little bit of
that<00:01:56.469> soft<00:01:56.860> edge<00:01:57.450> now<00:01:58.450> we<00:01:58.509> can<00:01:58.719> take<00:01:58.869> it<00:01:58.990> one

00:01:59.099 --> 00:01:59.109 
that soft edge now we can take it one

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:00.840 
that soft edge now we can take it one
step<00:01:59.350> further<00:01:59.560> and<00:01:59.710> go<00:01:59.890> to<00:01:59.950> edge<00:02:00.130> effect<00:02:00.520> and

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
step further and go to edge effect and

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.560 
step further and go to edge effect and
we<00:02:01.539> can<00:02:01.719> give<00:02:01.899> it<00:02:02.340> very<00:02:03.340> interesting<00:02:03.729> edge<00:02:04.240> or

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
we can give it very interesting edge or

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.620 
we can give it very interesting edge or
frame<00:02:05.409> or<00:02:05.649> border<00:02:06.039> around<00:02:06.460> our<00:02:06.609> image<00:02:06.969> if<00:02:07.509> we

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
frame or border around our image if we

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.370 
frame or border around our image if we
hit<00:02:07.750> rectangular

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
hit rectangular

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.630 
hit rectangular
you<00:02:11.380> can<00:02:11.530> see<00:02:11.709> that<00:02:11.830> it's<00:02:11.950> kind<00:02:12.160> of<00:02:12.190> whitened

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
you can see that it's kind of whitened

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.150 
you can see that it's kind of whitened
out<00:02:12.819> and<00:02:13.150> vignette<00:02:13.750> it<00:02:13.900> with<00:02:14.080> a<00:02:14.110> white<00:02:14.380> area<00:02:14.650> or

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
out and vignette it with a white area or

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:24.890 
out and vignette it with a white area or
we<00:02:16.060> can<00:02:16.209> do<00:02:16.300> circular<00:02:19.860> or<00:02:20.860> we<00:02:21.280> can<00:02:21.430> do<00:02:21.520> jagged

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.390 

so<00:02:25.900> for<00:02:26.110> now<00:02:26.200> I'm<00:02:26.560> going<00:02:26.769> to<00:02:26.830> make<00:02:27.190> sure<00:02:27.370> that

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
so for now I'm going to make sure that

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.059 
so for now I'm going to make sure that
I'm<00:02:27.640> on<00:02:27.880> none<00:02:28.420> because<00:02:29.410> I<00:02:29.500> like<00:02:29.680> having<00:02:29.950> that

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
I'm on none because I like having that

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.960 
I'm on none because I like having that
color<00:02:30.340> go<00:02:30.580> to<00:02:30.610> a<00:02:30.760> full<00:02:31.000> bleed<00:02:31.209> at<00:02:31.330> the<00:02:31.450> edge<00:02:32.970> so

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
color go to a full bleed at the edge so

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.400 
color go to a full bleed at the edge so
this<00:02:34.150> essentially<00:02:34.720> is<00:02:34.810> going<00:02:34.930> to<00:02:35.050> be<00:02:35.170> our

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
this essentially is going to be our

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.020 
this essentially is going to be our
clone<00:02:35.739> source<00:02:36.099> or<00:02:36.340> the<00:02:36.370> image<00:02:36.700> that<00:02:36.880> we're

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
clone source or the image that we're

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.360 
clone source or the image that we're
pulling<00:02:37.390> our<00:02:37.540> source<00:02:37.870> information<00:02:38.200> from<00:02:38.530> when

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
pulling our source information from when

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:40.710 
pulling our source information from when
we're<00:02:39.550> working<00:02:39.880> in<00:02:40.000> the<00:02:40.090> under<00:02:40.330> painting<00:02:40.630> or

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
we're working in the under painting or

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.270 
we're working in the under painting or
the<00:02:40.810> auto<00:02:40.959> painting<00:02:41.319> palette<00:02:44.069> now<00:02:45.069> I'm<00:02:45.130> going

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
the auto painting palette now I'm going

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.250 
the auto painting palette now I'm going
to<00:02:45.340> go<00:02:45.430> down<00:02:45.580> to<00:02:45.730> this<00:02:45.819> bottom<00:02:46.030> right<00:02:46.480> icon<00:02:47.110> it

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
to go down to this bottom right icon it

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.490 
to go down to this bottom right icon it
says<00:02:47.440> auto<00:02:47.620> clone<00:02:47.950> and<00:02:48.220> click<00:02:48.850> on<00:02:49.030> that<00:02:49.500> and

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
says auto clone and click on that and

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.670 
says auto clone and click on that and
you'll<00:02:50.709> see<00:02:50.920> that<00:02:51.069> now<00:02:51.420> we<00:02:52.420> have<00:02:52.660> a<00:02:53.080> painting

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
you'll see that now we have a painting

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.440 
you'll see that now we have a painting
we<00:02:53.980> have<00:02:54.010> a<00:02:54.190> copy<00:02:54.489> of<00:02:54.760> the<00:02:55.030> file<00:02:55.180> that<00:02:55.209> we're

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
we have a copy of the file that we're

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.160 
we have a copy of the file that we're
going<00:02:55.540> to<00:02:55.599> be<00:02:55.690> painting<00:02:56.049> on<00:02:56.200> untitled<00:02:56.830> one<00:02:57.160> and

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
going to be painting on untitled one and

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:06.000 
going to be painting on untitled one and
you<00:02:59.170> can<00:02:59.319> see<00:02:59.500> that<00:02:59.650> it's<00:02:59.769> grayed<00:03:00.040> out<00:03:05.010> next

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
you can see that it's grayed out next

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.199 
you can see that it's grayed out next
I'm<00:03:06.250> going<00:03:06.340> to<00:03:06.400> go<00:03:06.519> click<00:03:06.760> on<00:03:06.880> our<00:03:07.030> auto

painting palette and I'm going to cover

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.839 
painting palette and I'm going to cover

only see what's in our canvas and not so
much<00:03:18.400> of<00:03:18.519> that<00:03:18.549> ghosting<00:03:19.209> this<00:03:19.810> is<00:03:19.959> called

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
much of that ghosting this is called

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.259 
much of that ghosting this is called
your<00:03:20.290> tracing<00:03:20.650> paper<00:03:20.799> I'm<00:03:21.609> going<00:03:21.820> to<00:03:21.910> open<00:03:22.030> up

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
your tracing paper I'm going to open up

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:29.220 
your tracing paper I'm going to open up
window<00:03:22.680> clone<00:03:23.680> source<00:03:23.920> palette<00:03:26.489> and<00:03:28.049> you<00:03:29.049> can

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
window clone source palette and you can

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.020 
window clone source palette and you can
see<00:03:29.410> this<00:03:29.530> blue<00:03:29.859> line<00:03:30.069> here<00:03:30.310> represents<00:03:30.459> what

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
see this blue line here represents what

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.240 
see this blue line here represents what
is<00:03:31.359> called<00:03:31.630> our<00:03:31.780> tracing<00:03:32.140> paper<00:03:32.290> and<00:03:32.560> a

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
is called our tracing paper and a

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.370 
is called our tracing paper and a
tracing<00:03:33.640> paper<00:03:33.790> is<00:03:34.090> exactly<00:03:34.540> that<00:03:34.810> it's<00:03:35.079> just

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
tracing paper is exactly that it's just

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.349 
tracing paper is exactly that it's just
showing<00:03:35.530> you<00:03:35.799> a<00:03:35.829> ghosting<00:03:36.430> of<00:03:36.609> your<00:03:36.970> original

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:37.359 
showing you a ghosting of your original

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:39.539 
showing you a ghosting of your original
image<00:03:37.660> so<00:03:38.100> we're<00:03:39.100> going<00:03:39.190> to<00:03:39.250> take<00:03:39.400> that

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 
image so we're going to take that

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:43.559 
image so we're going to take that
tracing<00:03:39.940> paper<00:03:40.060> to<00:03:40.239> 0%<00:03:40.660> and<00:03:42.329> then<00:03:43.329> we're<00:03:43.450> going

00:03:43.559 --> 00:03:43.569 
tracing paper to 0% and then we're going

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:45.059 
tracing paper to 0% and then we're going
to<00:03:43.600> toggle<00:03:43.810> it<00:03:44.079> by<00:03:44.260> clicking<00:03:44.620> on<00:03:44.739> this<00:03:44.859> button

or you can hit command or control T for

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000 
or you can hit command or control T for
tracing<00:03:49.329> paper<00:03:49.450> so<00:03:50.440> I<00:03:50.500> want<00:03:50.650> to<00:03:50.680> make<00:03:50.829> sure

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
tracing paper so I want to make sure
