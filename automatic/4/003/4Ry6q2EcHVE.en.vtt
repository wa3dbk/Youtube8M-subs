 dad dad dad fans 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.900
 hey pineapple hey I'm not a pineapple maybe 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.010
 I see how a pineapple you have like a pineapple 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.129
 I would have stuck my tongue 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:22.090
 I am a durian outlet but 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:25.180
 you can call me style durham turia doria 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.760
 glory if I knew I had seen that 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.530
 movie 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.630
 I am a delicious exotic fruit not a 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:34.480
 car that travels in time is fine 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.309
 is well understood do you think your 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.610
 words are going to hurt me friend I have 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:42.699
 news for you will not do it that way it looks 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:46.270
 You have a hard face, that's how I am 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:48.160
 I have thick skin and super hard is that 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.170
 so hard you're good I do not like to brag 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.110
 but people say that I am hard as a 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.930
 nail yes those nails are not so hard 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:01:00.370
 like me long if I wanted to could 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.630
 cut diamonds with my face bathes before 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.360
 an old slogan of the form has been 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.190
 built hard like a durian but what 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.820
 I doubt a lot because these trucks do not 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:12.770
 they were all that's the one forward spit 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.960
 I am a seed seriously 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.979
 I do not think you like the notice is 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.719
 all right 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.719
 not even the ones in you 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:28.390
 that here is blowing the breeze 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:30.520
 it barely tickles me hey it's the 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.540
 The toughest thing that she has done is a 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.689
 difficult question 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.759
 as I like it costs me choose I 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:38.320
 been rude for so long once 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:40.270
 I said to Bruce Willis that I did not like his 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.229
 shirt again from I won to clint eastwood 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.640
 in a gaze contest and again 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.580
 once I made noises with my mouth so much 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.340
 time I faint is fine that's not 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.670
 It's hard in itself but I'll try it now 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.670
 same 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.650
 I do not think you really did 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.020
 to prove it 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.470
 you're deaf I was not asking you for a 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.470
 demonstration 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.750
 it's fine I think you once did 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.230
 so many noises with your mouth and you have me 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:16.780
 you went down 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:19.000
 finally a little silence that I had the 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.549
 frightening dream that it was not 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.240
 I think I want to know what you think 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:25.790
 you are going to use me 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.670
 I do not know what to tell us we are 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.530
 a dragon was a scary clown the 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:36.950
 global warming 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:41.150
 what is not even I felt the 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:44.430
 heavens, if you are a hardhead, let's go 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.319
 what is this amateur night 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.950
 you're not okay I do not want to meddle 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:53.790
 but codes the better we go 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:56.560
 arms I will face the two heavens and 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:01.830
 they say that I am dense 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:05.280
 that's all your partner has already 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.280
 model before 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.540
 I do not know what could come after that 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.069
 that does make me some tickle 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.950

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:24.670
 orange 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:24.670
 do not forget do not forget how hard it was 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.959
 because we can from 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.780
 poor spike he made me laugh pieces 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:44.010
 people are not not true 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.840
 turtle boots my head I 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.730
 they did speak come out head 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.980
 of my head 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.930
 now I feel much better I have returned to 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.430
 normality was going to tell them to look 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.890
 the advances of the orange series 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.830
 annoyed at cartoon network that is a 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:01.049
 Monday at 8:30 or 7:30 Central hours 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.599
 do not forget it and you will see me act and such 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:04.920
 they see me dancing and it's an event that 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:06.510
 may never be seen again in 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.610
 television and you will not want to miss it boy 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.910
 neither my mom nor the mother of table 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.910
 neither the mother of anyone nor their children 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.910
 look at it
