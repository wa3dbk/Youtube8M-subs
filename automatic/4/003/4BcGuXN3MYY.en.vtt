00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:27.169
 cook in play good I bring a new 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.270
 logic video that we did yesterday with 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:31.789
 subscribers handing out many millions 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.920
 as always goku gameplay never fails 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:36.559
 in the good things the truth is that this 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.120
 lobby was super good well it took 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:40.100
 a little more in dropping money for 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.960
 problems that we had connection and that 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.670
 but good the truth is that we were 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.739
 making groups of four in four of 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.089
 55 and then we all get together but 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.180
 well everyone went with their 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:51.769
 millions depends on the connection you have 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.570

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:55.390
 I can pull five hours by lobbying 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.769

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.119
