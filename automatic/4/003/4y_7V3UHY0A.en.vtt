00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.670
 new content the new secrets the 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.620
 new map the new characters the 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.480
 I kept saying that but good everything new 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.949
 of plants against zombies so 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.199
 stay is the end of this video if 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.119
 you love this game in case 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.039
 have not bought it yet without a doubt 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.930
 I recommend you friends receive 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.180
 messages that if it's worth that what 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.920
 games are bought this kind of thing well 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.380
 I encourage you because it really is very 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.360
 addictive very fun they will spend hours 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.309
 of fun so the first thing that 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.079
 let's see in this video will be both 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.809
 new characters that gives us the new 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.610
 dlc remember that to lower it in case 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.309
 that they are in xbox one the only thing 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.809
 have to do is go to the game is 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.940
 say put in their game asks them a 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.739
 update they accept it and 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.930
 they will automatically have the content 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.360
 totally free in case they are 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.280
 in xbox 360 I do not know if it works 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.079
 same way with the update or if 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.300
 they have to go directly to the store and 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.340
 download it but in any case it's 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.710
 free now in terms of the characters 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.640
 are going to give us two are the first of 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.130
 they 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.500
 the citrus cactus that is wrapped in 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.990
 Orange peel makes me very father 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.909
 very funny and the second one is 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.430
 we launched as if it were a haul 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.140
 peas for now throws blackberries and now 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.660
 yes friends let's go with the secrets 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.550
 of the historical ones that surely all 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.500
 you want to know the first of 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.810
 they are just outside the map and 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.780
 precisely a little inspired by what 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.150
 we saw a few months ago with him and about 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.759
 christian germann I said probably 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.100
 go see also a secret outside the 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.350
 map and if we do have a 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.259
 secret dedicated to the game of dragon age 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.149
 in question is a helmet that has a 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.710
 dragon in the front I'm going to 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.110
 put an image so they can also 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.149
 identify it and apart from all this 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.890
 we can also see that same helmet 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.140
 but inside the factory that belongs 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.970
 to the zombies along with a sword that 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.429
 it's also from the same dragon age game 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:02.130
 in case they do not locate it either the 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:03.750
 sword I will also leave you the image of 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.610
 done here when I'm with the zombie I 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.310
 it seems that it is clearer what is the 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.229
 sword and what is the dragon in the helmet 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.090
 so you can identify it 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.950
 something that I have realized is that what 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.260
 are in the historic in plants against 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.180
 zombies tend to repeat them a lot 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.530
 example in that video in the first 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.049
 video that I made of the best 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.510
 secrets of plants by their zombies les 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:27.150
 showed on the same map there was like 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.890
 four or five secrets of the same thing 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.010
 I say good because they do not put better 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.170
 different instead of repeating so much not 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.180
 I know the answer but we can see this 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.700
 secret of dragon age twice in this 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.170
 map from now on friends all 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.090
 the secrets that we are going to see or at least 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.890
 most will be inside that dream 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.959
 interactive that is something new here in 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.760
 plants against zombies unless I 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.040
 remember I had not seen any map with 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.620
 some interactive thing and access a 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.180
 small reference because there is a mode of 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.239
 new game called van wyk 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.190
 Conforming or deletion confirmed further 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.709
 of all this there is a train that passes every 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.670
 some time and I tell you all this in 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:07.470
 what map and what and how do friends think 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.599
 effectively in black ops 2 the map of 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.430
 express and likewise a train passes 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:13.109
 every so often in case all this 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.819
 I was little friends I tried to get on 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:17.220
 train just for fun to see if yes 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.810
 you could or not and also killing me 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.180
 same way that happens in that game by 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.250
 So I think it's not quite a 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.680
 secret is not quite a strike but 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.989
 I definitely think that they were based not 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.849
 I think if it's a small reference to 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.470
 black ops 2 and the expression map of 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:33.180
 you who think is not something 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.190
 confirmed is simply a small 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.630
 theory that I have but certainly I 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.730
 I would like you to share this 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.040
 with me so leave it down here in 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.780
 the comments the secret sign friends 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.329
 is dedicated to a game called 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.829
 beauty and as the name implies 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:49.319
 what to see with jewelry which also has 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:51.450
 a lot of sense since the map on which 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:53.849
 we find in new map the name 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.889
 it's joe jones jones sorry if I say it in 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:57.930
 English but my game is in Spanish well 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:04:00.480
 I do not forgive you sorry if you live in 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.430
 English but my game is in English and not 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.319
 I have the remotest idea of how it would be 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.989
 in Spanish in the case you have to see 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:08.970
 with jewelry and good in my hyun is a game 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:11.010
 what is created by popcap games 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.690
 besides that this company has also 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.820
 created plants against zombies which 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.620
 makes much more sense then what 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.810
 Throughout the map we will see different 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.000
 jewelry but not all are similar to those of 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.770
 this game however those that are 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.140
 inside the train that I showed you a while ago 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.810
 if they look too much so we have 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:30.060
 the third historical fourth and the best 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.620
 which I'm going but we already have more and be 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.870
 ex so let's use with the following 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.520
 that has to do with minecraft so 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.980
 prepare yourself fanatics because surely 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.080
 you will love it is something very small is 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:41.160
 a very simple reference but still 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.290
 I am very sure that you will like it 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.720
 then we are going to go this way in this 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:48.360
 side of the map and we're going to find a 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.310
 store that is called crafting table and 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.470
 good if you have played minecraft in 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.570
 English will know that this is the name of the girl 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.730
 of work I only say in English and of 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.950
 done when I saw it I said oh no 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.690
 manches is from minecraft because because a 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.730
 friend when he taught me to play at 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.410
 minus the basics I'm all one in the 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:07.440
 mayorazgo but when he taught the basics 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.880
 in the xbox 360 he would tell me the names 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.710
 in English because he lived a long time 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.330
 there so it stayed very etched 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.980
 when he told me crafting table 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.540
 crafting 'tablet' crafting teo so 

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:18.180
 when I saw the name I 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:20.220
 minecraft and apart from all this we have 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.630
 a very small cube that even though 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.790
 it's nothing related to minecraft 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:26.550
 we have the name of the work table 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:30.650
 we have this cube therefore that 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:32.600
 we do not care as well is minecraft friends 

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.940
 finally friends to close with a clasp 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.979
 of gold this video we will see a story 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:38.720
 which was actually announced the same day 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:41.150
 of the launch of the tactical trailer 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:43.820
 the cue by major nelson that 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:45.889
 he was the one who commented that video he told us 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:48.259
 that the commander's fans always 

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:50.720
 we had to be very careful because 

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:52.940
 there would be a secret dedicated to him and how 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:54.740
 he is a character that stars in 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:56.930
 game of mass effect first thing that no 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:58.970
 it was just a secret of more effective 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:01.490
 and yes indeed in what is the train 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:04.039
 that we all know we will see your ship 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:05.510
 what is the normandie and s2 I am in what 

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:07.580
 correct I do not improve very well but what 

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:09.800
 I say yes anyway does not come 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.910
 the man only says instead of more 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:13.550
 effective 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:14.870
 efe as if it were grass effect which 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.449
 it is a very additional detail too 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:20.000
 funny and something father of the rest of grass 

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:21.800
 effect is that the launch day of 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.680
 plants against zombies bardem warfare 

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:25.970
 the other effects took a picture 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.979
 congratulating the launch of the 

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:29.990
 plants against zombies and he said 

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:31.610
 he just examined it on his screens and 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:33.919
 I'm going to put the photo better, I think 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:35.690
 they speak more than a thousand words and saw everything 

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:37.670
 it makes sense too, since so much more 

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:40.460
 effect like plants vs zombies 

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:42.230
 are games distributed by jay and now 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.300
 yes friends nothing more before saying goodbye 

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:45.740
 I wanted to give you an additional detail that 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.840
 It has nothing to do with secrets 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:49.910
 something that surely is going to 

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:52.400
 interesting is that within the same train 

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:54.620
 we will see two cages in one of them 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.000
 will be a yeti and in the other will be a 

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:58.340
 zombie I think if it's the name that 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.690
 has this boss and good as I say no 

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:01.370
 it's secret or anything but it 's something very 

00:06:59.690 --> 00:07:03.440
 interesting that they will surely want 

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:05.000
 know and now yes friends I say goodbye 

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:07.190
 hoping you liked this 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.810
 video if they have some other secret that
