soap<00:00:35.090> and<00:00:35.329> then<00:00:35.870> we<00:00:35.989> have<00:00:36.140> regular<00:00:36.590> water

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
soap and then we have regular water

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
itself obviously you want to make sure

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.930 
itself obviously you want to make sure
that<00:00:39.770> the<00:00:39.920> lens<00:00:40.100> is<00:00:40.220> clean<00:00:40.400> which<00:00:40.760> we've

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
that the lens is clean which we've

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.050 
that the lens is clean which we've
already<00:00:41.060> ensured<00:00:41.890> spray<00:00:42.890> the<00:00:42.950> lens<00:00:43.610> down<00:00:43.880> with

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:44.060 
already ensured spray the lens down with

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.010 
already ensured spray the lens down with
application<00:00:44.600> fluid<00:00:45.520> peel<00:00:46.520> the<00:00:46.730> actual<00:00:47.150> fog

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
application fluid peel the actual fog

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:57.610 
application fluid peel the actual fog
light<00:00:48.460> tint<00:00:49.460> from<00:00:49.990> the<00:00:50.990> backing<00:00:51.620> paper<00:00:56.620> spray

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
light tint from the backing paper spray

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.480 
light tint from the backing paper spray
it<00:00:57.800> also<00:00:58.660> then<00:00:59.660> slide<00:01:00.410> it<00:01:00.560> in<00:01:00.680> the<00:01:00.770> housing<00:01:01.160> as

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:01.490 
it also then slide it in the housing as

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.460 
it also then slide it in the housing as
you<00:01:01.640> can<00:01:01.760> tell<00:01:01.970> the<00:01:02.150> actual<00:01:02.480> housing<00:01:02.690> is<00:01:03.050> the

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
you can tell the actual housing is the

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.399 
you can tell the actual housing is the
diameter<00:01:03.890> smaller<00:01:04.159> than<00:01:04.430> the<00:01:04.519> light<00:01:04.670> itself

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:05.409 
diameter smaller than the light itself

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:07.960 
diameter smaller than the light itself
so<00:01:06.409> we'll<00:01:06.799> have<00:01:06.920> the<00:01:07.009> taper<00:01:07.250> on<00:01:07.430> the<00:01:07.520> back<00:01:07.670> side

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
so we'll have the taper on the back side

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.149 
so we'll have the taper on the back side
and<00:01:09.039> once<00:01:10.039> you<00:01:10.520> have<00:01:10.700> it<00:01:10.729> in<00:01:10.969> the<00:01:11.090> housing

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
and once you have it in the housing

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:18.580 
and once you have it in the housing
Center<00:01:13.159> it<00:01:13.869> and<00:01:14.869> take<00:01:15.079> your<00:01:15.109> water<00:01:17.109> and<00:01:18.109> spray

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
Center it and take your water and spray

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.090 
Center it and take your water and spray
the<00:01:18.710> water<00:01:18.890> liberally<00:01:20.740> what<00:01:21.740> this<00:01:21.920> actually

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
the water liberally what this actually

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.789 
the water liberally what this actually
will<00:01:22.369> do<00:01:22.579> is<00:01:23.770> wash<00:01:24.770> away<00:01:24.979> some<00:01:25.549> of<00:01:25.609> the<00:01:26.799> soap

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
will do is wash away some of the soap

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:30.969 
will do is wash away some of the soap
out<00:01:28.009> of<00:01:28.189> the<00:01:28.340> application<00:01:28.609> fluid<00:01:29.390> and<00:01:29.979> we'll

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
out of the application fluid and we'll

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:32.980 
out of the application fluid and we'll
make<00:01:31.159> the<00:01:31.399> tint<00:01:32.030> to<00:01:32.149> stick<00:01:32.390> to<00:01:32.719> the<00:01:32.840> lens

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
make the tint to stick to the lens

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.109 
make the tint to stick to the lens
itself<00:01:33.350> as<00:01:34.069> you<00:01:34.130> can<00:01:34.280> tell<00:01:34.520> already<00:01:34.670> without

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
itself as you can tell already without

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:36.849 
itself as you can tell already without
even<00:01:35.359> having<00:01:35.450> tapered<00:01:35.960> it<00:01:36.049> looks<00:01:36.289> so<00:01:36.799> much

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:36.859 
even having tapered it looks so much

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:40.929 
even having tapered it looks so much
better<00:01:37.869> then<00:01:38.869> it<00:01:39.770> does<00:01:39.979> from<00:01:40.189> the<00:01:40.280> factory<00:01:40.729> and

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
better then it does from the factory and

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:43.359 
better then it does from the factory and
just<00:01:41.869> gives<00:01:42.049> it<00:01:42.109> that<00:01:42.170> nice<00:01:42.380> dark<00:01:42.889> menacing

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
just gives it that nice dark menacing

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.359 
just gives it that nice dark menacing
look<00:01:43.990> at<00:01:44.990> this<00:01:45.200> point<00:01:45.499> you<00:01:45.619> can<00:01:45.770> get<00:01:46.130> rid<00:01:46.340> of

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
look at this point you can get rid of

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:53.410 
look at this point you can get rid of
the<00:01:47.350> excess<00:01:48.350> fluid<00:01:48.969> and<00:01:52.299> using<00:01:53.299> that

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
the excess fluid and using that

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.389 
the excess fluid and using that
microfiber<00:01:53.899> towel<00:01:54.259> and<00:01:54.889> work<00:01:55.130> your<00:01:55.249> way

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
microfiber towel and work your way

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:57.279 
microfiber towel and work your way
around<00:01:55.549> that<00:01:55.819> lens<00:01:56.090> and<00:01:56.240> of<00:01:56.389> course<00:01:56.659> the<00:01:56.990> trick

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289 
around that lens and of course the trick

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:00.669 
around that lens and of course the trick
here<00:01:57.560> is<00:01:57.590> to<00:01:57.679> get<00:01:57.920> that<00:01:58.869> which<00:01:59.869> now<00:02:00.109> majority

00:02:00.669 --> 00:02:00.679 
here is to get that which now majority

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:04.440 
here is to get that which now majority
is<00:02:00.829> the<00:02:01.579> water<00:02:02.119> out<00:02:02.420> of<00:02:02.779> from<00:02:03.139> behind<00:02:03.350> the<00:02:03.529> tip

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
is the water out of from behind the tip

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.419 
is the water out of from behind the tip
and<00:02:05.450> then<00:02:05.929> once<00:02:06.170> you<00:02:06.380> get<00:02:06.649> it<00:02:06.799> to<00:02:06.829> that<00:02:07.069> point

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429 
and then once you get it to that point

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:09.880 
and then once you get it to that point
we're<00:02:08.209> going<00:02:08.330> to<00:02:08.390> apply<00:02:08.539> some<00:02:08.630> heat<00:02:09.110> from<00:02:09.770> a

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
we're going to apply some heat from a

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.300 
we're going to apply some heat from a
heat<00:02:10.039> gun<00:02:10.250> and<00:02:10.490> it<00:02:11.180> will<00:02:11.470> shrink<00:02:12.470> the<00:02:12.800> tint

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
heat gun and it will shrink the tint

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:44.670 
heat gun and it will shrink the tint
forcing<00:02:14.030> the<00:02:14.209> majority<00:02:14.599> of<00:02:14.689> the<00:02:14.750> water<00:02:14.900> out

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.160 

then<00:02:45.680> using<00:02:46.010> your<00:02:46.040> towel<00:02:46.930> continue<00:02:47.930> to<00:02:48.019> work

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
then using your towel continue to work

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.789 
then using your towel continue to work
out<00:02:48.409> any<00:02:48.650> fingers<00:02:49.129> that<00:02:49.310> it<00:02:49.970> has<00:02:50.239> created<00:02:50.510> and
