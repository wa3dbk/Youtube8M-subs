00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
that seemed like today there are so many

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.359 
that seemed like today there are so many
different<00:01:58.210> race<00:01:58.479> strategy<00:01:58.810> situations<00:01:59.800> just

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
different race strategy situations just

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.040 
different race strategy situations just
as<00:02:00.490> much<00:02:00.670> as<00:02:00.850> the<00:02:00.970> track<00:02:01.240> change<00:02:01.600> because<00:02:01.929> of

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
as much as the track change because of

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:03.840 
as much as the track change because of
the<00:02:02.110> weather<00:02:02.289> changing<00:02:02.740> soft<00:02:03.130> yeah<00:02:03.729> I<00:02:03.759> mean
