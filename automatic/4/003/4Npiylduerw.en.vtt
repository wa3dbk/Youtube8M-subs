00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:07.500
 this is what they are the samsung galaxy s6 and 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.630
 the s6 edge 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.910
 the successors of successful galaxy s5 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.589
 samsung tends with these devices 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.190
 she listened to the feedback from 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:15.929
 users 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.030
 That's why Samsung has these devices 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.070
 Emphasis on design and on software 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.020
 and they need to take care of it 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.080
 optimum user experience 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.610
 going to see today if that worked out is what 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.190
 you feel and see right before that 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.320
 both the s6 and the s6 edge use 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.700
 plastic is a thing of the past 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.680
 they are the edges made of aluminum 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.480
 and they are slightly convex causing the 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.340
 devices feel sturdy and tasty 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.200
 A handy for the back case 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.300
 samsung for a glass finish 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.800
 what creates a luxurious appearance we 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.680
 view a white and a black one today 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.480
 variant but both the s6 and the s6 edge 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.250
 are also in gold at t-mobile 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.989
 to order 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.970
 the screen both devices have one 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.739
 5.1 inch screen with a quad hd 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.500
 resolution which ensures a razor sharp 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.420
 used amell and technique 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.710
 thereby for high contrast so that the 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.880
 really colors off the screen 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.379
 splashing 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.880
 the screen of the edge stands out even more 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.690
 because the edges are on both sides 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.890
 ending 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.510
 we have seen this before with the note 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.650
 edge and it gives the device a lot 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.820
 to be tight 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.680
 in addition, these edges also have one 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.000
 number of functions so you can here 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.360
 for example a number of contacts 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.490
 assign and it is possible to here 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.750
 information such as weather and time 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.680
 display 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.509
 finally we see that they are the 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.860
 connection for the headphones and the 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:28.509
 speakers to the bottom of the 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.009
 telephones have moved 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:32.860
 this does not dampen the sound 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:35.619
 if you have the phone really fast already 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.060
 as the samsung with the s6 in the s6 edge 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:38.710

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.140
 awl in look and feel the at one 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.280
 top device 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.320
 the devices and turn on the last 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.820
 version of touchwiz that is based on 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.430
 android 500 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.810
 by the fast 64-bit processor and 3 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.630
 gigabyte of memory 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.840
 the ss and the assets respond quickly and 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.100
 runs the software without any slowness 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.080
 the devices are supplied with a 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.420
 some remarkable apps we find the 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.470
 trusted and self-application back 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.630
 allowing different fitness 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.890
 can display related data with the 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.299
 sensor on the back you can 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.670
 for example your heartbeat 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:10.290
 or measure the oxygen content of your pants 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.980
 with this you can easily 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:14.170
 prepare training schedules or 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.150
 determine training goals 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.890
 the smarts manager is new to the ss 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.330
 here we find a number of options with which 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.620

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.110

 remains as stream also bought the smart 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.019
 remote app is not missing this makes 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.400
 use the infrared emitter now upstairs 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.890
 is integrated in the devices 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.209
 this allows you to control almost any TV and 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.950
 so you never have to look for one 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.540
 remote control 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.370
 Finally, we also find the cloud service 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.890
 onedrive on the devices and you get 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:45.390
 purchase 100 gigabytes of free storage 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.390
 from an ss or an sms 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.170
 compared to the galaxy s5 are also 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.780
 the cameras in the new s6 and the s6 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.430
 edge greatly improved 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.750
 so is the light sensitivity of the lens 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.670
 enlarged and is for optical 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.260
 Image stabilization added 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.700
 this reduces the quality of photos 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.250
 low light situations 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.930
 fling code is also the resolution of 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.300
 raise the front camera to 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.209
 5 megapixels making selfies broken 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.340
 sharper is also in the camera apps one 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.110
 number of your super super handy 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.120
 is that the camera is always on and off 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.920
 there twice quickly after that 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.180
 button 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.610
 furthermore we see the usual options 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.260
 to apply different effects 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.390
 eg, there is a panorama mode 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.610
 and a professional booth where you 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.260
 determine all settings yourself and 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:34.650
 the ability to record slow motion videos 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:36.180
 shoot with the galaxy s6 and the s6 edge 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.290
 Samsung is clearly another way 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.880
 smashed 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.280
