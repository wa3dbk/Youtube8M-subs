 portal glass and finger 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:10.639
 all mobile entertainment on glafi.com 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.639
 near row 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.939
 hello everyone with you to goal 73 and today 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:19.970
 we'll talk about the american average 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:22.490
 tank of the tenth level m48 patton 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.619
 start with weapons after purchase 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.599
 patton you get it with a weapon from 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.849
 level nine and to deliver 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:31.640
 top one needs a little effort and 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:33.559
 accumulate 45 thousand experience but if you 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.480
 use a premium account with you 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:39.320
 no problems with this 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:43.040
 and here after 20 25 fights dried up small 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:46.309
 face put top gun and think that's 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.350
 now how bent yes really gun 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.480
 decent and bends confidently 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.579
 but there is one nuance completely her 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.149
 potential is revealed only in direct 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:55.280
 hands 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:59.329
 because accuracy is our worst among 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.159
 all of 3 already 036 by 100 meters but time 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:04.309
 information in principle at the level with all 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:06.620
 classmates two seconds dpm wpad 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:10.640
 he is in third place after the British 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.090
 in a moment we pour damage on 2690 8 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.270
 to the enemy 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:17.150
 worse indicator only German but what we 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.250
 about bad to bad in the gun there are pluses 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.620
 not quite a bad stabilization in 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.780
 movement happened very often 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.390
 such moments that when moving the projectile 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.970
 hit right on target with 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.130
 this damage is about damage per shot basically 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.680
 say it makes no sense because he's on all of 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:37.550
 100 10 same except 62 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.300
 go to armor vld 110 millimeters but 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.910
 here nld 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.340
 just has huge dimensions so 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:46.010
 hopes for rebound is not particularly worth it 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.820
 it is punched by all who feel like it in a mask 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:52.040
 we are 114 millimeters and 117 more behind the mask 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:55.220
 total we get two hundred thirty one 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.950
 millimeter these are already serious numbers 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.590
 thanks to the thick mask we do not punch 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.610
 cumulative from a landmine is not full 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:07.030
 armor and stern damage is very weak 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:09.530
 76 and 50 millimeters respectively 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.459
 maximum speed of only 45 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.800
 kilometers per hour 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.840
 worse only British but 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.750
 unfolding tank in place pretty 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.670
 smartly 50 degrees per second hardly 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.219
 other medium tanks will be able to us 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.200
 swirl, we ourselves will be able to this good 

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:27.140
 do with engine power 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:30.230
 810 horsepower we have a specific 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.900
 power 17 horses per ton but chip 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:36.290
 Tank is not his gun is not his mask 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:39.080
 and not even his dynamics he has that 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:42.069
 what no tank has on the tenth 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.569
 level he just had a huge review in 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:46.160
 270 meters which we can strengthen 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:49.190
 coated optics 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.530
 to achieve surveys of 300 meters with 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:55.069
 such a review, we illuminate the enemy 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:57.500
 earlier than he us though we have such 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:58.099
 dimensions that don't light us up very much 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.799
 heavy 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:03.860
 the corners of the vertical pickup is also pretty 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:05.349
 decent and make up -9 degrees 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.000
 allowing us to effectively 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:10.670
 use the tank in the game through the tower and 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.730
 as we know the mask is pretty 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.860
 strong well let's go to tactics 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.079
 combat as we have enough 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.390
 small maximum speed we are not 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:22.670
 we will be able to occupy key points first 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.299
 stick with other mediums 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.180
 by tanks 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:29.299
 it makes no sense to us we can play great 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.400
 support for heavy tanks then we will 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:34.190
 much better than other st 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.470
 if you hit a mountainous card like that 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.180
 like el alamein then to the maximum 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.130
 try to protect your body in 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:43.040
 folds of the terrain showing at the same time 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:45.680
 only tower apply swing tactics 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.959
 try constantly to ricochet chance from 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.540
 the towers will be very high either 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:52.910
 the enemy just misses don't be afraid 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.340
 cumulative and mine bombs mask we 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:57.470
 massive and when playing from corners for the most 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.040
 parts will be visible only she 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:03.790
 let's consider all the pros and cons 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:06.370
 This car to the pluses can be attributed 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:09.590
 wonderful vertical alignment angles 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:12.410
 good motion stabilization best 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.930
 review in the game is a good cross and 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:17.030
 excellent turning to minuses 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.849
 large size low maximum 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:22.610
 gun speed and low accuracy 

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:24.830
 summing up I want to say that Patton 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.710
 is very skill dependent and 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:30.110
 it will be extremely hard for a beginner to master it 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:33.190
 and the players who have seen a lot in our 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:36.130
 the game will be able to easily know the whole price 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:38.470
 on this unit but on this i am with you 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.270
 say goodbye to everyone thanks for watching 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.040
