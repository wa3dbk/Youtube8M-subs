00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
so let's get started the first step is

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.290 
so let's get started the first step is
to<00:00:22.529> build<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.980> news<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.369> news<00:00:23.580> is<00:00:23.760> located

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
to build the news the news is located

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.570 
to build the news the news is located
between<00:00:24.420> the<00:00:24.660> church<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.500> courtroom<00:00:26.189> you

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
between the church and the courtroom you

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.519 
between the church and the courtroom you
need<00:00:27.029> four<00:00:27.330> parts<00:00:27.660> with<00:00:27.779> this<00:00:27.900> news<00:00:28.199> and<00:00:28.410> the

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
need four parts with this news and the

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.290 
need four parts with this news and the
scattered<00:00:28.920> across<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.369> map<00:00:29.699> so<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.090> first

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
scattered across the map so the first

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.299 
scattered across the map so the first
part<00:00:30.599> is<00:00:30.779> right<00:00:31.349> next<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.650> jug<00:00:31.920> on<00:00:32.160> the

need the giant to actually open it and

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.170 
need the giant to actually open it and
you<00:00:58.410> could<00:00:58.590> behind<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:58.980> podium<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.460> the

you could behind the podium and the
battery<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:00.780> there<00:01:01.050> so<00:01:01.320> once<00:01:01.530> you<00:01:01.680> have<00:01:01.890> that

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
battery is there so once you have that

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.920 
battery is there so once you have that
built<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.550> next<00:01:02.789> step<00:01:02.969> is<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.329> blow<00:01:03.629> up<00:01:03.660> the

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.920 
built the next step is to blow up the
orbs<00:01:04.229> now<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:04.860> don't<00:01:05.220> have<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.610> actually

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
orbs now you don't have to actually

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.390 
orbs now you don't have to actually
charge<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.170> orbs<00:01:07.530> like<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:07.950> do<00:01:08.130> for

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
charge the orbs like you do for

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.310 
charge the orbs like you do for
Richthofen<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.420> just<00:01:09.630> have<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.840> blow<00:01:09.990> them<00:01:10.170> up

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320

so<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:10.710> blow<00:01:11.220> them<00:01:11.400> up<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:12.030> need<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.540> turbine

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
so to blow them up you need the turbine

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.859 
so to blow them up you need the turbine
and<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.560> subsonic<00:01:14.220> resonator<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.630> go<00:01:15.810> to

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
and the subsonic resonator and you go to

pick<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.280> up<00:01:47.399> you<00:01:47.549> need<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.729> get<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:47.970> lot<00:01:48.270> of

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
pick it up you need to get a lot of

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.749 
pick it up you need to get a lot of
kills<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.350> easiest<00:01:49.710> way<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.009> do<00:01:50.310> this<00:01:50.340> is

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
kills and the easiest way to do this is

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.780 
kills and the easiest way to do this is
they<00:01:51.210> get<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.659> giant<00:01:52.290> feed<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.369> giant<00:01:53.670> with

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
they get the giant feed the giant with

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.639 
they get the giant feed the giant with
candy<00:01:54.180> so<00:01:54.689> we<00:01:54.810> can<00:01:54.960> start<00:01:55.140> whacking<00:01:55.409> the

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
candy so we can start whacking the

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.609 
candy so we can start whacking the
zombies<00:01:56.040> when<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.729> giant<00:01:57.380> actually<00:01:58.380> kills

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
zombies when the giant actually kills

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.160 
zombies when the giant actually kills
the<00:01:58.770> zombies<00:01:59.130> it<00:01:59.280> does<00:01:59.460> not<00:01:59.640> kill<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.450> actually

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
the zombies it does not kill it actually

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.080 
the zombies it does not kill it actually
makes<00:02:01.380> them<00:02:01.530> respawn<00:02:01.920> but<00:02:02.219> it<00:02:02.430> still<00:02:02.759> counts

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
makes them respawn but it still counts

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.209 
makes them respawn but it still counts
for<00:02:03.240> kills<00:02:03.479> for<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.780> lantern<00:02:04.229> so<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:05.040> best

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
for kills for the lantern so the best

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.090 
for kills for the lantern so the best
way<00:02:05.430> to<00:02:05.460> do<00:02:05.729> it<00:02:05.880> besides<00:02:06.030> killing

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
way to do it besides killing

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.249 
way to do it besides killing
killing<00:02:07.550> the<00:02:07.670> zombies<00:02:07.700> yourself<00:02:08.390> is<00:02:08.750> to<00:02:09.050> feed

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
killing the zombies yourself is to feed

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.640 
killing the zombies yourself is to feed
the<00:02:09.290> giant<00:02:10.009> with<00:02:10.280> candy<00:02:10.940> so<00:02:11.150> he<00:02:11.270> can<00:02:11.650> kill

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
the giant with candy so he can kill

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.130 
the giant with candy so he can kill
zombie<00:02:13.040> city<00:02:13.310> you<00:02:14.000> know<00:02:14.120> make<00:02:14.570> the<00:02:14.720> process

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
zombie city you know make the process

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.800 
zombie city you know make the process
even<00:02:15.500> quicker<00:02:15.800> so<00:02:16.160> you<00:02:16.220> guys<00:02:16.540> can<00:02:17.540> get<00:02:17.690> the

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
even quicker so you guys can get the

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.680 
even quicker so you guys can get the

you'll<00:02:22.850> hear<00:02:23.090> a<00:02:23.120> bunch<00:02:23.450> of<00:02:23.570> chimes<00:02:23.870> before<00:02:24.380> it

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
you'll hear a bunch of chimes before it

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:21.850 
need to put the time bomb before do you
do<00:03:19.790> this<00:03:20.000> step<00:03:20.209> now<00:03:20.840> once<00:03:21.230> you<00:03:21.380> know<00:03:21.560> which

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
do this step now once you know which

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.670 
do this step now once you know which
sign<00:03:22.250> do<00:03:22.430> you<00:03:22.489> have<00:03:22.640> to<00:03:22.790> hit<00:03:23.630> you<00:03:24.170> go<00:03:24.320> to<00:03:24.380> the

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
sign do you have to hit you go to the

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.670 
sign do you have to hit you go to the
tunnels<00:03:25.010> and<00:03:25.190> hit<00:03:25.430> the<00:03:25.580> exact<00:03:26.000> same<00:03:26.320> spa<00:03:27.320> or

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
tunnels and hit the exact same spa or

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.520 
tunnels and hit the exact same spa or
signs<00:03:28.010> that<00:03:28.640> you<00:03:29.299> found<00:03:29.570> out<00:03:29.750> from<00:03:29.900> the<00:03:30.080> cipher

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
signs that you found out from the cipher

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.949 
signs that you found out from the cipher
the<00:03:31.100> first<00:03:31.519> one<00:03:31.730> and<00:03:32.060> the<00:03:32.239> second<00:03:32.600> one<00:03:32.660> this<00:03:32.810> is

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
the first one and the second one this is

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:35.020 
the first one and the second one this is
different<00:03:33.290> for<00:03:33.410> everyone<00:03:33.620> again<00:03:33.950> and<00:03:34.820> then

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
different for everyone again and then

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.870 
different for everyone again and then
once<00:03:35.360> you<00:03:35.510> hit<00:03:35.690> the<00:03:35.840> third<00:03:36.049> one<00:03:36.350> a<00:03:36.880> will-o-wisp

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
once you hit the third one a will-o-wisp

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.690 
once you hit the third one a will-o-wisp
will<00:03:38.330> spawn<00:03:38.720> and<00:03:39.080> this<00:03:39.620> wisp<00:03:39.980> will<00:03:40.220> go<00:03:40.370> across

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
will spawn and this wisp will go across

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.640 
will spawn and this wisp will go across
the<00:03:40.850> map<00:03:41.030> this<00:03:41.480> is<00:03:41.660> different<00:03:42.019> again<00:03:42.290> every

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
the map this is different again every

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.350 
the map this is different again every
time<00:03:42.680> depending<00:03:43.310> on<00:03:43.430> which<00:03:43.640> cipher<00:03:44.030> you<00:03:44.180> get

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
time depending on which cipher you get

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:47.229 
time depending on which cipher you get
so<00:03:44.959> you<00:03:45.680> might<00:03:45.890> need<00:03:46.040> to<00:03:46.220> do<00:03:46.370> some<00:03:46.400> trial<00:03:47.150> and

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
so you might need to do some trial and

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.150 
so you might need to do some trial and
error<00:03:47.360> before<00:03:47.690> you<00:03:47.930> can<00:03:48.110> see<00:03:48.380> exactly<00:03:48.739> where

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
error before you can see exactly where

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.870 
error before you can see exactly where
this<00:03:49.760> trail<00:03:50.720> goes<00:03:51.019> so<00:03:51.350> a<00:03:51.700> corresponding<00:03:52.700> with

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
this trail goes so a corresponding with

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.759 
this trail goes so a corresponding with
this<00:03:53.060> trail<00:03:53.390> you<00:03:53.660> need<00:03:53.810> to<00:03:53.989> set<00:03:54.230> up<00:03:54.260> three

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
this trail you need to set up three

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:58.690 
this trail you need to set up three
trains<00:03:55.870> along<00:03:56.870> the<00:03:57.019> way<00:03:57.200> from<00:03:57.530> this<00:03:57.769> and<00:03:58.070> the

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
trains along the way from this and the

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.949 
trains along the way from this and the
noose<00:03:58.910> our<00:03:59.660> trains<00:04:00.080> were<00:04:00.380> the<00:04:00.769> barn<00:04:01.190> in

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
noose our trains were the barn in

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:04.390 
noose our trains were the barn in
between<00:04:02.959> the<00:04:03.170> barn<00:04:03.410> and<00:04:03.560> the<00:04:03.680> saloon<00:04:04.040> and<00:04:04.280> the

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
between the barn and the saloon and the

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.820 
between the barn and the saloon and the
saloon<00:04:04.970> and<00:04:05.390> you<00:04:06.080> need<00:04:06.200> to<00:04:06.320> make<00:04:06.530> sure<00:04:06.680> the

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 
saloon and you need to make sure the

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.800 
saloon and you need to make sure the
person<00:04:07.190> that<00:04:07.310> activates<00:04:07.820> it<00:04:08.060> has<00:04:08.360> to<00:04:08.600> follow

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
person that activates it has to follow

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.280 
person that activates it has to follow
the<00:04:09.370> wisp<00:04:10.370> all<00:04:10.700> the<00:04:10.970> way<00:04:11.060> through<00:04:11.420> all<00:04:11.900> the<00:04:12.200> way

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
the wisp all the way through all the way

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.390 
the wisp all the way through all the way
until<00:04:12.500> the<00:04:13.360> noose<00:04:14.360> so<00:04:15.049> it<00:04:15.410> needs<00:04:15.680> to<00:04:15.950> actually

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
until the noose so it needs to actually

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.360 
until the noose so it needs to actually
go<00:04:16.579> through<00:04:16.850> these

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
go through these

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.849 
go through these
these<00:04:17.549> two<00:04:18.269> charged<00:04:18.690> up<00:04:18.959> so<00:04:19.139> that<00:04:19.320> this<00:04:19.590> is<00:04:19.739> the

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
these two charged up so that this is the

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.099 
these two charged up so that this is the
reason<00:04:20.100> why<00:04:20.250> you<00:04:20.310> need<00:04:20.579> to<00:04:20.729> have<00:04:21.299> train<00:04:21.690> set<00:04:21.989> up

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
reason why you need to have train set up

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:23.900 
reason why you need to have train set up
along<00:04:22.470> the<00:04:22.710> way<00:04:22.830> so<00:04:22.889> it<00:04:23.280> can<00:04:23.400> actually<00:04:23.699> charge

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
along the way so it can actually charge

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:26.510 
along the way so it can actually charge
and<00:04:24.180> it<00:04:24.240> won't<00:04:24.360> disappear<00:04:24.979> now<00:04:25.979> you<00:04:26.040> see<00:04:26.340> the

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
and it won't disappear now you see the

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.159 
and it won't disappear now you see the
three<00:04:26.880> trains<00:04:27.180> I'll<00:04:27.419> show<00:04:27.600> them<00:04:27.660> in<00:04:27.870> depth

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169 
three trains I'll show them in depth

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:31.010 
three trains I'll show them in depth
when<00:04:28.410> we<00:04:28.590> repeat<00:04:29.070> but<00:04:29.760> once<00:04:30.449> you<00:04:30.600> get<00:04:30.810> the

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
when we repeat but once you get the

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.439 
when we repeat but once you get the
first<00:04:31.320> one<00:04:31.530> in<00:04:31.830> you<00:04:32.340> need<00:04:32.520> to<00:04:32.699> go<00:04:33.060> ahead<00:04:33.150> and

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:33.449 
first one in you need to go ahead and

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:35.120 
first one in you need to go ahead and
set<00:04:33.630> your<00:04:33.660> time<00:04:33.930> bomb<00:04:34.139> off<00:04:34.350> and<00:04:34.590> do<00:04:34.860> it<00:04:34.889> again

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
set your time bomb off and do it again

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.000 
set your time bomb off and do it again
now<00:04:35.910> this<00:04:36.120> is<00:04:36.300> very<00:04:36.600> tricky<00:04:36.870> this<00:04:37.229> took<00:04:37.710> us<00:04:37.740> a

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
now this is very tricky this took us a

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.320 
now this is very tricky this took us a
maybe<00:04:38.370> three<00:04:38.699> or<00:04:38.729> four<00:04:38.940> times<00:04:39.120> per<00:04:39.919> try<00:04:40.919> so<00:04:41.340> per

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
maybe three or four times per try so per

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.500 
maybe three or four times per try so per
lamp<00:04:42.600> you<00:04:43.080> should<00:04:43.260> say<00:04:43.470> so<00:04:44.040> the<00:04:44.520> second<00:04:45.360> time

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
lamp you should say so the second time

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.900 
lamp you should say so the second time
we<00:04:45.720> did<00:04:45.960> it<00:04:45.990> I<00:04:46.320> will<00:04:46.830> show<00:04:47.010> you<00:04:47.070> the<00:04:47.490> exact

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
we did it I will show you the exact

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.110 
we did it I will show you the exact
train<00:04:48.270> to<00:04:48.479> where<00:04:48.630> I<00:04:48.710> we<00:04:49.710> held<00:04:49.949> off<00:04:50.100> so<00:04:50.400> one<00:04:51.030> of

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
train to where I we held off so one of

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.790 
train to where I we held off so one of
the<00:04:51.180> trains<00:04:51.449> were<00:04:51.600> in<00:04:51.750> the<00:04:51.840> barn<00:04:52.050> the<00:04:52.650> other

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
the trains were in the barn the other

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.219 
the trains were in the barn the other
train<00:04:53.130> was<00:04:53.460> between<00:04:54.360> the<00:04:54.479> barn<00:04:54.690> and<00:04:54.840> the<00:04:54.960> soil

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:55.229 
train was between the barn and the soil

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:58.010 
train was between the barn and the soil
it<00:04:55.560> does<00:04:55.979> have<00:04:56.220> a<00:04:56.250> huge<00:04:56.550> radius<00:04:56.940> oh<00:04:57.210> that's<00:04:57.840> a

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
it does have a huge radius oh that's a

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.930 
it does have a huge radius oh that's a
good<00:04:58.169> place<00:04:58.350> to<00:04:58.380> put<00:04:58.710> it<00:04:58.800> and<00:04:58.979> the<00:04:59.520> last<00:04:59.760> one

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
good place to put it and the last one

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.370 
good place to put it and the last one
was<00:05:00.180> in<00:05:00.210> front<00:05:00.539> of<00:05:00.600> the<00:05:00.690> slope<00:05:00.960> this<00:05:01.229> is

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:01.380 
was in front of the slope this is

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.830 
was in front of the slope this is
obviously<00:05:01.860> different<00:05:02.100> for<00:05:02.430> everyone<00:05:02.729> so<00:05:03.180> you

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
obviously different for everyone so you

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.469 
obviously different for everyone so you
take<00:05:04.050> accomodate<00:05:04.590> to<00:05:04.860> whatever<00:05:05.490> the<00:05:05.910> path<00:05:06.240> is

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479 
take accomodate to whatever the path is

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:09.170 
take accomodate to whatever the path is
for<00:05:06.750> you<00:05:06.900> the<00:05:07.800> last<00:05:07.979> order<00:05:08.460> the<00:05:08.550> seventh<00:05:08.880> is

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180
