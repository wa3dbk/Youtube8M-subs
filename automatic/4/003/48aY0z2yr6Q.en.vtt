00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
one interception that interception was a

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.030 
one interception that interception was a
bad<00:01:51.360> pass<00:01:51.720> I<00:01:52.020> think<00:01:52.229> that<00:01:52.320> was<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.470> worst<00:01:52.740> pass

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
bad pass I think that was the worst pass

bad pass I think that was the worst pass

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
was not good today it was not good at

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.790 
was not good today it was not good at
all<00:02:26.130> they<00:02:26.700> are<00:02:26.880> last<00:02:27.180> place<00:02:27.630> in<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:27.989> NFL<00:02:28.560> in

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
all they are last place in the NFL in

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.530 
all they are last place in the NFL in
defense<00:02:29.370> they<00:02:29.790> needed<00:02:30.060> to<00:02:30.120> get<00:02:30.300> it<00:02:30.420> together

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
defense they needed to get it together

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.059 
defense they needed to get it together
and<00:02:31.020> it's<00:02:31.200> not<00:02:31.350> looking<00:02:31.500> like<00:02:31.739> they<00:02:31.890> will

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
and it's not looking like they will

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.610 
and it's not looking like they will
probably<00:02:32.340> be<00:02:32.760> making<00:02:33.209> the<00:02:33.300> playoffs<00:02:33.540> well<00:02:34.230> I'm

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
probably be making the playoffs well I'm

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.590 
probably be making the playoffs well I'm
afraid<00:02:34.890> they're<00:02:35.459> not<00:02:35.489> putting<00:02:35.850> themselves<00:02:36.390> in

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
afraid they're not putting themselves in

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.840 
afraid they're not putting themselves in
a<00:02:36.989> good<00:02:37.230> position<00:02:37.440> to<00:02:38.010> make<00:02:38.280> it<00:02:38.640> to<00:02:38.760> the

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
a good position to make it to the

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.400 
a good position to make it to the
playoffs<00:02:38.970> even<00:02:39.569> though<00:02:39.660> there<00:02:39.810> are<00:02:39.989> three

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
playoffs even though there are three
