and<00:02:00.350> yet<00:02:00.530> we<00:02:00.680> still<00:02:00.740> got<00:02:01.520> nothing<00:02:02.119> and<00:02:02.299> yeah

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
and yet we still got nothing and yeah

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.780

that's<00:02:02.840> an<00:02:03.020> absurdly<00:02:03.409> high<00:02:03.770> sunspot<00:02:04.400> number
