00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.940
 grimes nirs 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.590
 strange name in general but design 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:42.540
 cool what might fall out here 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:45.450
 and equal sets you know cheated 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.070
 some additional sets of us 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.160
 I do not know what that very free light 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.530
 so here is such a 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.260
 set on a bream the form of the king of pirates of his 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:59.340
 I surveyed a big garden very beautiful to me 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.960
 even just like it 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.970
 standard score here stuffed 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.960
 actually such a freebie kopets river such 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.260
 rivers 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:15.509
 I do not know a bunch I think the set 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:17.310
 very ugly so timber dream but 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.170
 tibbers give them a world of their coloring 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.930
 generally cool looks so red 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:26.520
 mechanically all very cool light to me 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:30.420
 like about treant workshop too it 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:33.329
 surveyed and now completed it improved in 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.990
 general treant such a milkman or something like that 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:41.009
 see here such a burning whole but 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.439
 only three sets of normal drag such 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.290
 even three nice set and barely at all like 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.720
 would it be a standard random courier with 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:53.430
 special effect and coloring from on it i 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:57.500
 I really hope so I do nâ€™t even have a reference 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:59.430
 so quickly okay, the first is with us and 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.490
 set to trent 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.350
 inspect dropped Well 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.229
 people unaware accustomed to counting since everything 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:12.519
 going fast for windows 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:14.220
 casey tell so this is a minus site on 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:20.549
 river 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:20.549
 let's talk further 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:29.570
 where set and here about lagged a little so 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.400
 tibbers or link to give tibbers 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:35.480
 CMC 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:38.130
 so what is the last timber 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:42.330
 yes here he did not drop us a courier to 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:45.090
 Sorry, so I also do not know whether to do 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:51.120
 unpacking or leaving it all nations 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:53.160
 only now I will think about the transfer all all 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:59.130
 these sets they will be played if 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:03:02.850
 what is there but who will stay here 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:07.080
 which I will not open so here I am 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:13.490
 I think on whom I play timberber can 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:13.490
 be up to 20 world weaving 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:24.890
 so so and here saw how that wooden 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.890
 looks like armor 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:31.550
 Details usually accidentally clicked only 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:36.720
 such a mask 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:41.730
 claws on the boot screen which 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:46.620
 which I do not like superfluous is not removed a 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:47.940
 all retired so well did not become from the fact that 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.980
 somehow everything does not immediately fall out 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:53.760
 quickly it turns out but such sets are common 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:56.900
 on trental really liked the whole move 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:04:01.550
 action itself if you let down 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.550
 some very small animals and 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:07.580
 hours for ute in the lobby and check changes 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:10.020
 and animations all thanks for your attention 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.420

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:15.900

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:19.250
