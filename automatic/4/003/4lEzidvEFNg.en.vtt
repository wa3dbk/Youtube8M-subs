00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.600 
economy and I'm also an American which
makes<00:00:10.929> me<00:00:11.139> a<00:00:11.349> funny<00:00:11.830> spokesperson<00:00:12.400> for<00:00:12.519> the

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:12.610 
makes me a funny spokesperson for the

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:14.070 
makes me a funny spokesperson for the
European<00:00:12.940> University<00:00:13.330> Institute<00:00:13.360> but<00:00:13.929> not

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:14.080 
European University Institute but not

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.430 
European University Institute but not
really<00:00:14.379> because<00:00:14.620> this<00:00:14.950> place<00:00:15.190> is<00:00:15.630> a<00:00:16.630> an

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:17.440 
really because this place is a an

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.259 
really because this place is a an
intersection<00:00:18.430> of<00:00:18.520> many<00:00:18.700> different<00:00:18.849> cultures

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:19.269 
intersection of many different cultures

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:22.050 
intersection of many different cultures
and<00:00:19.510> so<00:00:20.050> I<00:00:20.560> remember<00:00:21.189> first<00:00:21.490> coming<00:00:21.760> here<00:00:21.939> and

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.060 
and so I remember first coming here and

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.529 
and so I remember first coming here and
thinking<00:00:23.310> this<00:00:24.310> place<00:00:24.580> has<00:00:24.820> all<00:00:25.090> of<00:00:25.119> Europe

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:25.539 
thinking this place has all of Europe

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:27.089 
thinking this place has all of Europe
packed<00:00:25.869> into<00:00:26.080> one<00:00:26.199> and<00:00:26.500> maybe<00:00:26.740> it's<00:00:26.920> more<00:00:27.039> than

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:27.099 
packed into one and maybe it's more than

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:29.189 
packed into one and maybe it's more than
I<00:00:27.279> can<00:00:27.340> stand<00:00:27.550> but<00:00:28.090> I<00:00:28.269> found<00:00:28.630> that<00:00:28.779> I<00:00:28.869> can<00:00:28.990> stand

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:29.199 
I can stand but I found that I can stand

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:31.079 
I can stand but I found that I can stand
it<00:00:29.320> quite<00:00:29.470> well<00:00:29.500> and<00:00:29.859> perhaps<00:00:30.550> you<00:00:30.789> will<00:00:30.939> too

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:31.089 
it quite well and perhaps you will too

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:34.500 
it quite well and perhaps you will too
so<00:00:32.080> I<00:00:32.410> want<00:00:33.190> to<00:00:33.250> talk<00:00:33.340> a<00:00:33.430> little<00:00:33.520> bit<00:00:33.670> about<00:00:33.760> why

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
so I want to talk a little bit about why

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.090 
so I want to talk a little bit about why
people<00:00:34.900> find<00:00:35.200> the<00:00:35.350> European<00:00:35.710> University

Europe and indeed around the world in
certain<00:00:54.820> cases<00:00:55.090> one<00:00:55.840> where<00:00:56.260> a<00:00:56.320> community<00:00:56.530> of

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:56.770 
certain cases one where a community of

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.970 
certain cases one where a community of
scholars<00:00:56.950> the<00:00:57.610> EUI<00:00:57.910> is<00:00:58.060> centered<00:00:58.600> on<00:00:58.980> doctoral

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
scholars the EUI is centered on doctoral

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.710 
scholars the EUI is centered on doctoral
training<00:01:00.160> it's<00:01:00.610> what<00:01:00.820> we<00:01:00.940> do

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:01.720 
training it's what we do

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.390 
training it's what we do
and<00:01:01.960> so<00:01:02.500> when<00:01:02.620> you<00:01:02.710> interest<00:01:03.040> a<00:01:03.070> doctoral

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:03.400 
and so when you interest a doctoral

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.280 
and so when you interest a doctoral
student<00:01:03.460> you<00:01:04.000> come<00:01:04.239> in<00:01:04.449> and<00:01:04.689> you're

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
student you come in and you're

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.289 
student you come in and you're
immediately<00:01:05.560> the<00:01:06.400> center<00:01:06.640> of<00:01:06.729> attention<00:01:06.939> and

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:07.299 
immediately the center of attention and

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:10.080 
immediately the center of attention and
around<00:01:07.719> you<00:01:07.929> is<00:01:08.140> a<00:01:08.200> wonderful<00:01:09.189> set<00:01:09.369> of<00:01:09.490> faculty

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
around you is a wonderful set of faculty

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.609 
around you is a wonderful set of faculty
if<00:01:10.390> we<00:01:10.539> can<00:01:10.689> say<00:01:10.780> that<00:01:10.899> about<00:01:11.079> ourselves<00:01:11.200> but

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:11.619 
if we can say that about ourselves but

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:13.830 
if we can say that about ourselves but
also<00:01:11.770> a<00:01:11.950> set<00:01:12.189> of<00:01:12.280> postdoctoral<00:01:13.240> researchers

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
also a set of postdoctoral researchers

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:14.999 
also a set of postdoctoral researchers
who<00:01:13.960> are<00:01:13.990> here<00:01:14.229> a<00:01:14.259> large<00:01:14.530> postdoctoral

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:15.009 
who are here a large postdoctoral

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:17.429 
who are here a large postdoctoral
community<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:16.630> you'll<00:01:16.990> find<00:01:17.200> it's<00:01:17.350> a<00:01:17.409> very

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:17.439 
community and you'll find it's a very

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:19.349 
community and you'll find it's a very
non<00:01:17.890> hierarchical<00:01:18.369> place<00:01:18.729> to<00:01:18.909> do<00:01:19.030> your<00:01:19.060> work

00:01:19.349 --> 00:01:19.359 
non hierarchical place to do your work

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:21.929 
non hierarchical place to do your work
now<00:01:20.020> you'll<00:01:20.499> spend<00:01:20.710> a<00:01:20.829> lot<00:01:20.950> of<00:01:20.979> time<00:01:21.219> alone<00:01:21.729> at

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:21.939 
now you'll spend a lot of time alone at

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:23.609 
now you'll spend a lot of time alone at
your<00:01:21.969> desk<00:01:22.270> working<00:01:22.539> as<00:01:22.840> you<00:01:23.320> will<00:01:23.469> as<00:01:23.560> a

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
your desk working as you will as a

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:25.440 
your desk working as you will as a
doctor<00:01:23.859> soon<00:01:23.979> anywhere<00:01:24.340> but<00:01:25.210> you<00:01:25.299> have

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
doctor soon anywhere but you have

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:26.880 
doctor soon anywhere but you have
Florence<00:01:25.810> when<00:01:26.140> you<00:01:26.229> leave<00:01:26.380> your<00:01:26.499> desk<00:01:26.619> and

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
Florence when you leave your desk and

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.279 
Florence when you leave your desk and
and<00:01:27.340> that's<00:01:27.520> sometimes<00:01:27.700> appealing<00:01:28.270> the<00:01:29.049> fact

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:29.289 
and that's sometimes appealing the fact

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:30.419 
and that's sometimes appealing the fact
that<00:01:29.380> you<00:01:29.499> come<00:01:29.649> to<00:01:29.679> a<00:01:29.799> community<00:01:29.979> of<00:01:30.249> scholars

00:01:30.419 --> 00:01:30.429 
that you come to a community of scholars

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:32.370 
that you come to a community of scholars
to<00:01:31.240> work<00:01:31.390> on<00:01:31.569> these<00:01:31.659> issues<00:01:31.840> and<00:01:32.140> Social

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
to work on these issues and Social

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.440 
to work on these issues and Social
Sciences<00:01:32.530> gives<00:01:33.399> you<00:01:33.549> a<00:01:33.579> broader<00:01:33.880> view<00:01:34.179> and

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
Sciences gives you a broader view and

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:35.580 
Sciences gives you a broader view and
that's<00:01:34.539> maybe<00:01:34.780> the<00:01:34.899> other<00:01:35.020> great<00:01:35.229> strength<00:01:35.499> of

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
that's maybe the other great strength of

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.410 
that's maybe the other great strength of
the<00:01:35.679> EU<00:01:35.859> I<00:01:35.890> there<00:01:36.340> is<00:01:36.460> no<00:01:36.609> dominant<00:01:37.030> culture
