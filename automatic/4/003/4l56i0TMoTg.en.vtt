in this one

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.810 
in this one
this<00:00:15.630> pyramid<00:00:15.990> is<00:00:16.560> just<00:00:16.890> like<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.250> front<00:00:17.580> one

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
this has turned backwards so it gives

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.710 
this has turned backwards so it gives
you<00:00:21.359> a<00:00:21.390> back<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:22.380> forth<00:00:22.619> motion<00:00:23.330> it<00:00:24.330> makes<00:00:24.600> a

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
you a back and forth motion it makes a

you a back and forth motion it makes a
different<00:00:25.140> sound<00:00:25.730> this<00:00:26.730> is<00:00:26.910> made<00:00:27.119> out<00:00:27.150> of<00:00:27.359> over

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900

I guess sometime fine smooth man give me
a<00:00:30.660> deal<00:00:31.430> more<00:00:32.430> than<00:00:32.489> me<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.730> make<00:00:32.940> him<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:33.210> call
