could happen this evening this is the
area<00:00:29.460> on<00:00:29.640> watch<00:00:29.910> and<00:00:30.210> I<00:00:30.269> also<00:00:30.480> suggest<00:00:30.840> you

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
area on watch and I also suggest you

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.709 
area on watch and I also suggest you
check<00:00:31.439> out<00:00:31.619> torque<00:00:31.980> on<00:00:32.189> regularly<00:00:32.940> this<00:00:33.570> will

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
check out torque on regularly this will

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.900 
check out torque on regularly this will
probably<00:00:33.899> be<00:00:34.200> updated<00:00:34.950> within<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.430> hour<00:00:35.579> and

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
probably be updated within the hour and

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.190 
probably be updated within the hour and
multiple<00:00:36.329> times<00:00:36.600> throughout<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.170> day

multiple times throughout the day

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.080 
multiple times throughout the day
remember<00:00:37.860> that<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.160> higher<00:00:38.370> number<00:00:38.879> here

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
remember that the higher number here

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.880 
remember that the higher number here
correlates<00:00:39.629> with<00:00:39.809> the<00:00:39.870> stronger<00:00:40.350> chance<00:00:40.649> for

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
correlates with the stronger chance for

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.940 
correlates with the stronger chance for

when<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.290> solar<00:01:40.530> wind<00:01:40.619> speed<00:01:41.070> drops<00:01:41.400> near

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
when the solar wind speed drops near

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.760 
when the solar wind speed drops near
four<00:01:42.060> hundred<00:01:42.479> or<00:01:42.600> three<00:01:42.780> hundred<00:01:42.869> kilometers

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
four hundred or three hundred kilometers

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.160 
four hundred or three hundred kilometers
per<00:01:43.799> second<00:01:44.340> so<00:01:44.880> in<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.030> energy<00:01:45.180> equalization

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
per second so in the energy equalization

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.719 
per second so in the energy equalization
poses<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.680> biggest<00:01:46.710> induction<00:01:47.310> threat

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
poses the biggest induction threat

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.149 
poses the biggest induction threat
similar<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.899> massive<00:01:49.350> gas<00:01:49.560> giant<00:01:49.590> that

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
similar to the massive gas giant that

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.010 
similar to the massive gas giant that
sits<00:01:50.430> in<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.670> midnight<00:01:51.030> position<00:01:51.540> directly

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
sits in the midnight position directly

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.289 
sits in the midnight position directly
behind<00:01:52.140> us<00:01:52.619> we're<00:01:53.340> on<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.579> road<00:01:53.759> today<00:01:54.000> but<00:01:54.270> I

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
behind us we're on the road today but I

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.789 
behind us we're on the road today but I
hope<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.570> get<00:01:54.689> you<00:01:54.810> guys<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:54.960> full<00:01:55.350> planetary

hope to get you guys a full planetary
