practicing and for gigs is called tempo

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.029 
practicing and for gigs is called tempo
and<00:00:46.940> it's<00:00:47.659> by<00:00:47.780> a<00:00:47.809> company<00:00:48.199> called<00:00:48.260> frozen<00:00:48.649> ape

and it's by a company called frozen ape
and<00:00:49.339> that<00:00:49.969> app<00:00:50.239> is<00:00:50.719> not<00:00:50.899> only<00:00:51.109> great<00:00:51.379> because

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
and that app is not only great because

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.889 
and that app is not only great because
it<00:00:52.129> provides<00:00:52.489> different<00:00:52.729> subdivision<00:00:53.479> it

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
it provides different subdivision it

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:56.079 
it provides different subdivision it
provides<00:00:54.379> different<00:00:54.889> time<00:00:55.249> signatures<00:00:55.789> and

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:56.089 
provides different time signatures and

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:58.029 
provides different time signatures and
whatnot<00:00:56.690> but<00:00:56.719> you<00:00:56.989> can<00:00:57.139> also<00:00:57.260> mute<00:00:57.710> certain

00:00:58.029 --> 00:00:58.039 
whatnot but you can also mute certain

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:00.099 
whatnot but you can also mute certain
notes<00:00:58.489> which<00:00:59.149> is<00:00:59.179> a<00:00:59.329> great<00:00:59.539> feature<00:00:59.749> to<00:00:59.870> have

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109 
notes which is a great feature to have

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:03.099 
notes which is a great feature to have
that<00:01:00.319> I'll<00:01:00.409> go<00:01:00.530> into<00:01:00.769> in<00:01:00.859> a<00:01:00.949> sec<00:01:01.329> but<00:01:02.329> also<00:01:02.839> as

00:01:03.099 --> 00:01:03.109 
that I'll go into in a sec but also as

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:05.980 
that I'll go into in a sec but also as
far<00:01:03.559> as<00:01:03.620> live<00:01:03.920> playing<00:01:04.339> you<00:01:04.910> can<00:01:05.090> save<00:01:05.630> set

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
far as live playing you can save set

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.220 
far as live playing you can save set
lists<00:01:06.440> now<00:01:07.340> saving<00:01:08.120> set<00:01:08.450> lists<00:01:08.810> might<00:01:09.050> not

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:09.230 
lists now saving set lists might not

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:10.660 
lists now saving set lists might not
sound<00:01:09.410> like<00:01:09.590> a<00:01:09.620> big<00:01:09.830> deal<00:01:09.980> but<00:01:10.040> if<00:01:10.370> you<00:01:10.490> play

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
sound like a big deal but if you play

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.780 
sound like a big deal but if you play
with<00:01:10.820> a<00:01:10.880> bunch<00:01:11.120> of<00:01:11.240> different<00:01:11.600> bands<00:01:11.810> and<00:01:12.310> in<00:01:13.310> a

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
with a bunch of different bands and in a

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.400 
with a bunch of different bands and in a
bunch<00:01:14.030> of<00:01:14.120> different<00:01:14.420> settings<00:01:14.570> being<00:01:15.290> able

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:15.410 
bunch of different settings being able

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.410 
bunch of different settings being able
to<00:01:15.650> save<00:01:15.890> set<00:01:16.190> lists<00:01:16.430> for<00:01:16.610> different<00:01:16.910> projects

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
to save set lists for different projects

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.020 
to save set lists for different projects
is<00:01:17.630> really<00:01:18.530> crucial<00:01:18.770> and<00:01:19.070> a<00:01:19.250> real<00:01:19.490> time<00:01:19.790> saver

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
is really crucial and a real time saver

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.640 
is really crucial and a real time saver
that<00:01:20.450> can<00:01:20.600> help<00:01:21.020> you<00:01:21.200> out<00:01:21.320> down<00:01:21.560> the<00:01:21.710> line<00:01:23.650> time

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
that can help you out down the line time

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.190 
that can help you out down the line time
guru<00:01:25.070> is<00:01:25.490> another<00:01:25.850> great<00:01:26.060> metronome<00:01:26.570> app<00:01:26.720> this

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
guru is another great metronome app this

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.960 
guru is another great metronome app this
one<00:01:27.440> is<00:01:27.680> strictly<00:01:28.070> for<00:01:28.280> practicing<00:01:28.820> though

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
one is strictly for practicing though

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.810 
one is strictly for practicing though
its<00:01:29.570> main<00:01:29.870> feature<00:01:30.170> is<00:01:30.680> that<00:01:30.920> it<00:01:31.190> randomly

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
its main feature is that it randomly

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.800 
its main feature is that it randomly
mutes<00:01:32.860> certain<00:01:33.860> clicks<00:01:34.400> or<00:01:35.030> certain<00:01:35.450> counts

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
mutes certain clicks or certain counts

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.430 
mutes certain clicks or certain counts
now<00:01:36.530> why<00:01:36.800> is<00:01:36.860> this<00:01:37.100> great<00:01:37.430> because<00:01:38.180> when<00:01:38.690> the

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
now why is this great because when the

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.650 
now why is this great because when the
click<00:01:39.710> actually<00:01:40.100> goes<00:01:40.280> away<00:01:40.580> and<00:01:40.820> it's<00:01:41.360> there

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
click actually goes away and it's there

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.050 
click actually goes away and it's there
but<00:01:42.140> you're<00:01:42.440> not<00:01:42.470> hearing<00:01:42.890> it<00:01:43.070> it<00:01:43.490> really<00:01:43.760> puts

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
but you're not hearing it it really puts

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.150 
but you're not hearing it it really puts
it<00:01:44.180> on<00:01:44.270> you<00:01:44.540> to<00:01:44.930> be<00:01:45.080> responsible<00:01:45.410> for<00:01:45.710> the<00:01:45.920> time

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160 
it on you to be responsible for the time

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.550 
it on you to be responsible for the time
now<00:01:46.970> if<00:01:47.150> you<00:01:47.510> just<00:01:47.750> are<00:01:47.930> practicing<00:01:48.440> with

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
now if you just are practicing with

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.890 
now if you just are practicing with
click<00:01:48.830> that<00:01:49.220> is<00:01:49.340> clicking<00:01:49.670> away<00:01:49.900> constantly

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:50.900 
click that is clicking away constantly

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.080 
click that is clicking away constantly
sometimes<00:01:51.680> you<00:01:51.950> can<00:01:52.070> become<00:01:52.340> dependent<00:01:52.760> on

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
sometimes you can become dependent on

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.030 
sometimes you can become dependent on
that<00:01:53.300> and<00:01:53.540> it's<00:01:54.320> almost<00:01:54.530> like<00:01:54.800> kind<00:01:54.950> of

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 
that and it's almost like kind of

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.500 
that and it's almost like kind of
training<00:01:55.460> wheels<00:01:55.610> on<00:01:55.760> a<00:01:55.790> bike<00:01:56.060> like<00:01:56.270> you<00:01:56.360> can

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510 
training wheels on a bike like you can

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:57.700 
training wheels on a bike like you can
just<00:01:56.540> kind<00:01:56.810> of<00:01:56.870> lean<00:01:57.110> on<00:01:57.140> it<00:01:57.409> you're<00:01:57.590> not

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
just kind of lean on it you're not

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.350 
just kind of lean on it you're not
really<00:01:57.980> working<00:01:58.310> on<00:01:58.370> your<00:01:58.430> balance<00:01:58.700> on<00:01:59.060> a<00:01:59.120> bike

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
really working on your balance on a bike

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.230 
really working on your balance on a bike
if<00:01:59.570> you<00:01:59.659> have<00:01:59.750> training<00:02:00.110> wheels<00:02:00.140> but<00:02:00.950> if<00:02:01.760> the

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
if you have training wheels but if the

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.270 
if you have training wheels but if the
click<00:02:02.480> is<00:02:02.600> actually<00:02:02.960> going<00:02:03.500> away<00:02:03.770> for<00:02:04.040> a<00:02:04.070> few

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
click is actually going away for a few

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.610 
click is actually going away for a few
beats<00:02:04.460> and<00:02:04.730> coming<00:02:04.970> back<00:02:05.180> it's<00:02:05.990> all<00:02:06.230> on<00:02:06.409> you

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 
beats and coming back it's all on you

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.350 
beats and coming back it's all on you
and<00:02:06.860> that's<00:02:07.610> what<00:02:07.730> we<00:02:07.790> want<00:02:07.970> to<00:02:08.030> develop<00:02:08.239> that

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
and that's what we want to develop that

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.790 
and that's what we want to develop that
we<00:02:08.569> want<00:02:08.750> to<00:02:08.780> develop<00:02:08.960> that<00:02:09.080> inner<00:02:09.350> sense<00:02:09.590> of

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
we want to develop that inner sense of

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.660 
we want to develop that inner sense of
time<00:02:10.009> so<00:02:10.759> it<00:02:11.120> has<00:02:11.660> an<00:02:11.870> adjustable<00:02:12.350> slider

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
time so it has an adjustable slider

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.570 
time so it has an adjustable slider
adjust<00:02:14.330> how<00:02:14.870> much<00:02:14.930> percentage<00:02:15.890> of<00:02:16.100> mute<00:02:16.340> there

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
adjust how much percentage of mute there

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.400 
adjust how much percentage of mute there
is<00:02:16.730> it's<00:02:17.060> really<00:02:17.420> powerful<00:02:17.780> so<00:02:17.959> the<00:02:18.110> more

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
is it's really powerful so the more

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.440 
is it's really powerful so the more
comfortable<00:02:19.100> you<00:02:19.610> get<00:02:19.730> with<00:02:19.910> your<00:02:20.030> time<00:02:20.240> and

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
comfortable you get with your time and

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.449 
comfortable you get with your time and
the<00:02:20.510> stronger<00:02:20.780> use<00:02:20.990> developed<00:02:21.500> that<00:02:21.650> time<00:02:21.890> the

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
the stronger use developed that time the

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.400 
the stronger use developed that time the
higher<00:02:22.940> the<00:02:23.209> percentage<00:02:23.390> of<00:02:23.750> muting<00:02:24.080> can<00:02:24.290> be

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
higher the percentage of muting can be

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.690 
higher the percentage of muting can be
all<00:02:24.800> the<00:02:25.040> way<00:02:25.130> up<00:02:25.220> to<00:02:25.310> a<00:02:25.340> hundred<00:02:25.550> percent

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
all the way up to a hundred percent

and they turn from red to green and that

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.120 
and they turn from red to green and that
little<00:03:24.700> bit<00:03:25.600> of<00:03:25.780> just<00:03:26.110> going<00:03:26.500> through<00:03:26.620> and

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
little bit of just going through and

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.890 
little bit of just going through and

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
melodies to play along to I use this a

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.790 
melodies to play along to I use this a
lot<00:04:02.800> in<00:04:03.220> classes<00:04:03.940> and<00:04:04.120> in<00:04:04.240> lessons<00:04:04.800> for

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 
lot in classes and in lessons for

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.770 
lot in classes and in lessons for
students<00:04:06.100> to<00:04:06.250> play<00:04:06.400> along<00:04:06.640> too<00:04:06.850> and<00:04:07.150> it<00:04:07.330> really

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
students to play along too and it really

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.199 
students to play along too and it really
is<00:04:08.170> much<00:04:08.500> more<00:04:08.680> exciting<00:04:09.040> and<00:04:09.370> inspiring<00:04:09.820> than

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
is much more exciting and inspiring than

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.510 
is much more exciting and inspiring than
just<00:04:10.420> a<00:04:10.510> regular<00:04:10.660> old<00:04:10.930> metronome<00:04:11.380> so<00:04:11.770> if<00:04:12.100> you

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:12.520 
just a regular old metronome so if you

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.180 
just a regular old metronome so if you
can<00:04:13.060> also<00:04:13.180> create<00:04:13.660> baselines<00:04:14.470> to<00:04:14.650> play<00:04:14.920> along

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
can also create baselines to play along

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.199 
can also create baselines to play along
with<00:04:15.490> and<00:04:15.790> it's<00:04:16.510> just<00:04:16.690> a<00:04:16.780> lot<00:04:16.930> of<00:04:16.959> fun<00:04:17.200> another

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
with and it's just a lot of fun another

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.360 
with and it's just a lot of fun another
very<00:04:19.209> cool<00:04:19.420> feature<00:04:19.690> with<00:04:20.140> this<00:04:20.350> is<00:04:20.590> that<00:04:21.190> it

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
very cool feature with this is that it

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.300 
very cool feature with this is that it
allows<00:04:21.850> you<00:04:22.210> to<00:04:23.110> set<00:04:23.410> a<00:04:23.440> percentage<00:04:24.100> of

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
allows you to set a percentage of

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.140 
allows you to set a percentage of
shuffle<00:04:25.030> so<00:04:25.720> you<00:04:25.780> can<00:04:26.200> really<00:04:26.350> work<00:04:26.620> on<00:04:26.800> in<00:04:27.760> the

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
shuffle so you can really work on in the

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.480 
shuffle so you can really work on in the
cracks<00:04:28.480> kind<00:04:28.900> of<00:04:28.960> in-between<00:04:29.110> straight<00:04:29.950> notes

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
cracks kind of in-between straight notes

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:34.560 
cracks kind of in-between straight notes
and<00:04:30.820> triplets<00:04:31.120> of<00:04:32.160> amounts<00:04:33.160> of<00:04:33.280> Swing<00:04:33.610> so<00:04:34.090> it

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
and triplets of amounts of Swing so it

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.660 
and triplets of amounts of Swing so it
gives<00:04:34.810> you<00:04:34.930> all<00:04:35.200> this<00:04:35.530> variety<00:04:36.130> and<00:04:36.340> I<00:04:36.490> don't

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:36.670 
gives you all this variety and I don't

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:37.860 
gives you all this variety and I don't
really<00:04:36.850> know<00:04:36.940> any<00:04:37.180> other<00:04:37.360> apps<00:04:37.570> that<00:04:37.690> allow

really know any other apps that allow

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.879 
really know any other apps that allow
you<00:04:37.960> to<00:04:38.110> do<00:04:38.260> that<00:04:38.410> very<00:04:39.160> cool

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:40.889 
you to do that very cool

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:46.200 
you to do that very cool
Live<00:04:41.889> BPM<00:04:42.900> this<00:04:43.900> is<00:04:44.080> a<00:04:44.110> interesting<00:04:45.040> app<00:04:45.520> that

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
Live BPM this is a interesting app that

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:47.940 
Live BPM this is a interesting app that
came<00:04:46.420> out<00:04:46.570> a<00:04:46.600> few<00:04:46.690> years<00:04:46.870> ago<00:04:47.110> and<00:04:47.680> what<00:04:47.860> it

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
came out a few years ago and what it

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:51.420 
came out a few years ago and what it
does<00:04:48.130> is<00:04:48.430> it<00:04:48.639> tracks<00:04:49.000> the<00:04:49.620> tempo<00:04:50.620> of<00:04:50.889> either

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
does is it tracks the tempo of either

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.850 
does is it tracks the tempo of either
your<00:04:51.700> plane<00:04:52.030> or<00:04:52.419> just<00:04:53.080> someone<00:04:53.470> clapping
