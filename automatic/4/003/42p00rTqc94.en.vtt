00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.839
 we will disassemble and replace 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:10.380
 parasitic lenses on our two wheels 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.790
 we could see there the son we see that he 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.940
 have a good meal 1 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.320
 so that's the result of the son who 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.720
 touch when the engine that is well 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.430
 hot so we'll dismount it because 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.680
 there it creates problems with parasites 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:27.240
 unfortunately at high speed we 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.019
 will be able to access your anti parasites 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:35.190
 will have to remove the cash for those 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:38.360
 remove or unscrew the screw one separates and 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:46.469
 that's lives that have been lost 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:49.770
 while a classified field up and there you 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:53.640
 access the anti parasite or the room 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:57.390
 which interests us today so we 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:00.030
 can see konate simply set of a 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:05.460
 screw indirectly on the chassis so 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:09.180
 to remove it you remove it from the 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:12.240
 candle it will have to come on the 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:18.740
 disconnect then 10 6 and 10 6 then from the 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.740
 davis and you take away the first cause 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:32.689
 the second dubout put you will come 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:32.689
 to tighten the screw that's here huh 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.970
 life has loosened want to remove 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:02:00.460
 voice 3 that parasitic can now 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:02:02.890
 to eat well then as you 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.119
 can observe it on our new 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.700
 Noise I miss something 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:09.640
 compared to the old I do not have too much 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.750
 name in mind let's say the lambic candle 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.610
 by candle 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.870
 so we 'll have to dismantle the old one because 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.260
 that works well there is no 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.810
 reason to redeem one for this you 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.420
 pull the small rubber protection 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:25.300
 and it's going to just go away 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:32.440
 it's just slipped inside the 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:34.500
 wire you remove this little tip in 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.500
 rubber 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:46.690
 you take the new you go it 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:51.130
 in here and then you cut the 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:53.860
 cable then to the desired length and that 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:56.590
 inside there is a small screw if we 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.230
 see well so it's this life that 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.420
 that we will have to come 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.280
 screwed into the copper soul then there my 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.680
 leather in the farmhouse and cooked inside 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:09.510
 son simply come aiming in full 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.510
 middle and you life is in 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:25.140
 hello tour, you still have to 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:27.260
 push at the same time you turn for 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:30.960
 help the cable to get in 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:34.020
 these his galley the screw risk no 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:40.590
 luckily break the strands of 

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:48.240
 copper and the contact will not be good and 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:52.620
 you'll be in a hurry here you do not 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:57.470
 put the little cap back and here you are 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.470
 you are preparing your parasite 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.060
 so to come reinstall your anti 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:05.840
 parasites 1 2 inch to you take it 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:12.360
 you will slip in the screw of just now 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:14.310
 and you put the screw back in 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.819
 location and you the whole series 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.130
 simply 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:20.759
 so you really have to do it 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:23.490
 be careful that their lenses 

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:28.500
 parasites on contact with the chassis 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:31.919
 of voting high otherwise you then 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.180
 bathing ignition problems so go 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:34.830
 effect well do not hesitate to put a 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.449
 a little stab of a knife 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.300
 cutter or what you want if there are 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:41.070
 waypoints for the contact to 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.229
 do really very very well and 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:50.180
 do not hesitate she serves is really 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:50.180
 it's good you put the candle 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:57.930
 like these and come back up and 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:05:00.080
 Scotland you just removed everything to 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.080
 time
