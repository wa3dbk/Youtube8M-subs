just cut all these off then we'll

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.300 
just cut all these off then we'll
arrange<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.550> pieces<00:01:18.060> together<00:01:18.619> well<00:01:19.619> on<00:01:20.100> this

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310

table and then I'm gonna go through the

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.469 
table and then I'm gonna go through the
glue<00:01:24.509> in<00:01:24.660> stage<00:01:25.880> gluing<00:01:26.880> everything<00:01:27.000> together

all the pieces to make up this really

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:43.850 
all the pieces to make up this really
detailed<00:01:31.740> figure<00:01:32.810> so<00:01:33.810> yeah

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860

all right so now we'll cleaned up these

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.210 
all right so now we'll cleaned up these
pieces<00:02:09.110> now<00:02:10.420> it's<00:02:11.420> time<00:02:11.720> for<00:02:11.830> the<00:02:12.830> glue<00:02:13.010> in<00:02:13.160> the

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
pieces now it's time for the glue in the

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:19.390 
pieces now it's time for the glue in the
stage<00:02:13.510> so<00:02:14.510> we'll<00:02:14.720> get<00:02:14.870> our<00:02:17.770> sisters<00:02:18.770> all<00:02:18.860> super

of the you know things
it's<00:03:24.700> a<00:03:24.760> glue<00:03:24.970> together<00:03:27.570> make<00:03:28.570> sure<00:03:28.600> it's

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:28.960 
it's a glue together make sure it's

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.420 
it's a glue together make sure it's
pressed<00:03:29.230> in

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
pressed in

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.979 
pressed in
you<00:03:32.430> may<00:03:32.520> be<00:03:32.580> holding<00:03:32.819> a<00:03:33.209> fir<00:03:33.480> you<00:03:34.050> know<00:03:34.760> yeah

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
you may be holding a fir you know yeah

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:39.290 
you may be holding a fir you know yeah
1520<00:03:36.989> seconds<00:03:37.610> because<00:03:38.610> it<00:03:38.730> dries<00:03:39.000> quite

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
1520 seconds because it dries quite

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:47.170 
1520 seconds because it dries quite
quick<00:03:39.629> this<00:03:39.870> glue

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.460 

because<00:03:47.720> we<00:03:47.810> won't<00:03:47.870> get<00:03:48.079> their<00:03:48.290> legs

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
because we won't get their legs

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.350 
because we won't get their legs
established<00:03:49.069> fast<00:03:49.340> because<00:03:49.730> everything<00:03:50.180> else

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
established fast because everything else

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.069 
established fast because everything else
just<00:03:50.450> builds<00:03:50.989> on<00:03:51.110> top<00:03:51.140> of<00:03:51.500> that<00:03:51.590> anyway<00:03:52.010> so<00:03:53.079> so

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:54.079 
just builds on top of that anyway so so

00:03:54.079 --> 00:04:06.980 
just builds on top of that anyway so so
we<00:03:54.200> want<00:03:54.409> to<00:03:54.500> achieve

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:06.990 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:17.860 

sure<00:04:07.990> that's<00:04:08.260> staying<00:04:08.680> there

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.509 

yeah

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.550 

you<00:04:22.030> can<00:04:22.180> leave<00:04:22.360> it<00:04:22.479> to<00:04:22.599> dry<00:04:23.110> you<00:04:23.440> know

starts<00:04:33.970> to<00:04:34.060> bond<00:04:34.270> quite<00:04:34.569> quickly<00:04:36.629> we<00:04:37.629> saw<00:04:37.840> the

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
starts to bond quite quickly we saw the

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.730 
starts to bond quite quickly we saw the
next<00:04:38.110> part<00:04:38.500> will<00:04:39.310> be<00:04:40.020> think<00:04:41.020> according<00:04:41.409> to<00:04:41.620> the

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
next part will be think according to the

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.820 
next part will be think according to the
instructions<00:04:42.449> it's<00:04:43.449> the<00:04:43.720> main<00:04:43.960> toss<00:04:44.289> up<00:04:44.590> out

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830
