choose from like race in this game so um

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.040 
choose from like race in this game so um
the<00:00:47.789> first<00:00:48.059> thing<00:00:48.300> that<00:00:48.329> it<00:00:48.539> starts<00:00:48.780> off<00:00:48.899> with

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
the first thing that it starts off with

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.680 
the first thing that it starts off with
is<00:00:49.230> a<00:00:49.260> training<00:00:49.739> mode<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:51.149> training<00:00:51.420> mode

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
is a training mode and the training mode

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.420 
is a training mode and the training mode
it's<00:00:51.989> kind<00:00:52.230> of<00:00:52.320> weird<00:00:52.559> because<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:52.890> mean<00:00:53.340> you

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
it's kind of weird because I mean you

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.360 
it's kind of weird because I mean you
think<00:00:53.579> racing<00:00:54.030> game<00:00:54.210> vertex<00:00:54.780> is<00:00:55.079> gasps<00:00:55.949> and

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
think racing game vertex is gasps and

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.299 
think racing game vertex is gasps and
squares<00:00:56.730> break<00:00:57.090> on<00:00:57.329> ps2<00:00:57.840> obviously<00:00:58.559> right<00:00:58.710> but

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
squares break on ps2 obviously right but

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.040 
squares break on ps2 obviously right but
they<00:00:59.640> like<00:00:59.820> show<00:01:00.329> you<00:01:00.390> it<00:01:00.629> in<00:01:00.660> some<00:01:00.930> weird

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
they like show you it in some weird

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.759 
they like show you it in some weird
training<00:01:01.649> videos<00:01:02.190> /<00:01:03.409> do-it-yourself<00:01:04.409> kind<00:01:04.650> of

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
training videos / do-it-yourself kind of

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.740 
training videos / do-it-yourself kind of
thing<00:01:04.920> it's<00:01:05.070> weird<00:01:05.250> but<00:01:05.760> I<00:01:05.820> guess<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:06.479> helps

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
thing it's weird but I guess it helps

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.270 
thing it's weird but I guess it helps
out<00:01:06.840> people<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.320> aren't<00:01:07.560> really<00:01:07.710> with<00:01:07.950> games

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
out people that aren't really with games

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.670 
out people that aren't really with games
so<00:01:09.470> that's<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.680> training<00:01:11.100> mode<00:01:12.350> the<00:01:13.350> next

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
so that's the training mode the next

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.230 
so that's the training mode the next

game invented

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.610 
game invented
it<00:03:23.000> was<00:03:23.150> tagged<00:03:23.450> and<00:03:23.870> said<00:03:23.990> it<00:03:24.110> was<00:03:24.140> a<00:03:24.380> TV

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
it was tagged and said it was a TV

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.690 
it was tagged and said it was a TV
version<00:03:25.030> so<00:03:26.030> one<00:03:26.780> person<00:03:27.020> would<00:03:27.560> drive<00:03:28.250> into

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
version so one person would drive into

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.340 
version so one person would drive into
another<00:03:28.910> person<00:03:29.390> and<00:03:29.540> when<00:03:29.930> that<00:03:30.050> person<00:03:30.200> got

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
another person and when that person got

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.770

hit<00:03:30.560> that<00:03:30.890> made<00:03:31.100> them<00:03:31.340> it's<00:03:31.700> quick<00:03:32.210> hit<00:03:32.570> and

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
hit that made them it's quick hit and

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.750 
hit that made them it's quick hit and
tagged<00:03:32.990> so<00:03:33.530> then<00:03:33.680> you<00:03:33.980> would<00:03:34.100> race<00:03:34.280> all<00:03:34.520> around

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
tagged so then you would race all around

the same land that you use for um
freestyle<00:03:51.110> so<00:03:51.680> it's<00:03:51.920> it's<00:03:52.910> not<00:03:53.120> like<00:03:53.450> on<00:03:53.570> a

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
freestyle so it's it's not like on a

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.160 
freestyle so it's it's not like on a
track<00:03:54.020> but<00:03:54.830> it's<00:03:55.130> it's<00:03:55.700> big<00:03:55.970> like<00:03:56.180> gates<00:03:56.630> like

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
track but it's it's big like gates like

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.750 
track but it's it's big like gates like
orange<00:03:57.560> gates<00:03:57.800> that<00:03:57.980> you<00:03:58.070> go<00:03:58.250> through<00:03:58.280> and<00:03:58.700> you

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
orange gates that you go through and you

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.250 
orange gates that you go through and you
have<00:03:59.150> to<00:03:59.240> go<00:03:59.360> through<00:03:59.600> those<00:03:59.810> and<00:03:59.840> that's<00:04:00.140> like

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
have to go through those and that's like

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.200 
have to go through those and that's like
a<00:04:00.320> lap<00:04:00.590> but<00:04:01.280> the<00:04:01.490> way<00:04:01.580> they<00:04:01.730> do<00:04:01.790> is<00:04:01.970> cool

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:02.210 
a lap but the way they do is cool

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:03.880 
a lap but the way they do is cool
because<00:04:02.330> when<00:04:02.930> you're<00:04:03.050> usually<00:04:03.200> on<00:04:03.530> like<00:04:03.740> a

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
because when you're usually on like a

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.820 
because when you're usually on like a
stadium<00:04:04.490> track<00:04:04.940> or<00:04:05.270> Maxis<00:04:06.050> national<00:04:06.470> track<00:04:06.680> or

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 
stadium track or Maxis national track or

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.710 
stadium track or Maxis national track or
something<00:04:07.130> if<00:04:07.250> you<00:04:07.640> go<00:04:07.820> off<00:04:07.940> the<00:04:08.120> track<00:04:08.150> and

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:08.720 
something if you go off the track and

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.020 
something if you go off the track and
they<00:04:09.080> reset<00:04:09.530> you<00:04:09.710> so<00:04:10.250> you<00:04:10.310> can't<00:04:10.610> cheat<00:04:10.880> or

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
they reset you so you can't cheat or

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.300 
they reset you so you can't cheat or
something<00:04:11.330> which<00:04:11.480> is<00:04:11.800> normal<00:04:12.800> I<00:04:12.860> guess<00:04:12.890> and<00:04:13.250> it

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
something which is normal I guess and it

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.210 
something which is normal I guess and it
makes<00:04:13.550> sense<00:04:13.790> but<00:04:14.360> during<00:04:15.350> the<00:04:15.500> cross-country

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
makes sense but during the cross-country

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.280 
makes sense but during the cross-country
and<00:04:16.400> duel<00:04:16.730> races<00:04:16.850> you<00:04:17.540> can<00:04:17.720> take<00:04:17.930> your<00:04:18.080> own

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
and duel races you can take your own

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.229 
and duel races you can take your own
route<00:04:19.040> you<00:04:19.310> don't<00:04:19.489> need<00:04:19.700> to<00:04:19.790> do<00:04:19.910> anything

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
route you don't need to do anything

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.240 
route you don't need to do anything
except<00:04:20.690> go<00:04:20.900> through<00:04:21.109> the<00:04:21.200> gates<00:04:21.470> so<00:04:21.980> you<00:04:22.070> can

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
except go through the gates so you can

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.270 
except go through the gates so you can
find<00:04:22.730> your<00:04:22.850> own<00:04:22.910> way<00:04:23.030> and<00:04:23.360> it's<00:04:23.480> very<00:04:23.830> yeah<00:04:24.830> you

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
find your own way and it's very yeah you

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.740 
find your own way and it's very yeah you

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
can use your imagination and stuff but

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.380 
can use your imagination and stuff but
generally<00:04:27.710> just<00:04:27.830> going<00:04:28.150> straight<00:04:29.150> around
