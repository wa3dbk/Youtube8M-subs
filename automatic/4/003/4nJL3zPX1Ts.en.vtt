 release sponsor dima coin seller 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.180
 Krivenko good prices for all platforms 

00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:08.429
 instant delivery of manners in general 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.380
 man verified link in description well 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.840
 and we begin hello hello hello 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.230
 My name is Kostya Pavlov as you remember 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.180
 her morning on this channel on pavlov channel 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.070
 playground at least two games for lpl and 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.960
 both lost 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.730
 despite the fact that the teams were in 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.289
 Generally something essentially different therefore 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.630
 one team was more or less 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.260
 weakly weak other team 2 was 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.690
 more or less just not the strongest of all 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.700
 possible compiled rbl so here i am 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.530
 I thought why did I lose because 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.239
 it seems for the Spaniard more or less bad 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.820
 I get to throw like too 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.460
 pretty well from the ZRP somehow not 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.700
 gone and I asked my friends 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.920
 football critics so let's say decompose 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.530
 all on the shelves and say why 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.320
 why I have not succeeded in these two matches 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:01:01.160
 so let's see what they don't 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:03.650
 will say yes further who is calling embroidered 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:07.860
 alexander riga 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:11.729
 listen to this thing to me here Konstantin Pavlov 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.070
 two matches threw on the layout 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.200
 completely with me first with me 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.689
 time is short in the second bone in Pavlov 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:24.270
 money is not enough for them to match 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:28.170
 broke you mean and peppa peppa not 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:33.270
 most you offer me to take and match 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:36.630
 Yes, I still consider the court and but for our 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.829
 collaboration has become good with our almost 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.530
 like a professional 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.630
 already and mark the score hit also think 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.180
 can handle that is you give me that 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:49.049
 some blessing this is this like these 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.750
 you know the Jedi Padawan is there 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:55.189
 count my padawan chef thanks big 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.790
 sandwich try not to shame 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:02:00.280
 stay because otherwise 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.950
 you know how I have in the technique 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.260
 punishment without anyone depriving them of a menu pair 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.700
 what they appreciate, thanks and 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:12.760
 thanks a lot warm everything up 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:14.620
 done in the shortest time everything is bad 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.230
 fell his guys well just everything is bad 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:20.380
 plays poorly start with the choice of composition 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.950
 whom to put up who why why do you 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.410
 this 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.990
 priests why de bike he have players 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.450
 much stronger much more necessary for you 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:31.030
 ransom frankly weak football player and 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.940
 you know what I don't like about deck 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:41.170
 just pontautsya first means platinum 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:41.890
 thinks to file then what is seen 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.220
 dare 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.910
 scored goals remember it all but money 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.239
 goalkeeper 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.730
 floor of infrequent 20 then he grumpy stampa 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:54.130
 gives it a grand unity who's head 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.220
 score can why leave it on 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:59.080
 corner than you thought but also continued 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.720
 of all this, here's a panda 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.610
 disgusting what is given abandon 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.280
 I visited him but I'm already used to 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:10.330
 group time will simply be impossible 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:12.820
 the center of the center show curi and could not 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:15.549
 score center field never lives how much 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:18.430
 I tried not to try to throw 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:20.500
 did not work and Paul thought that him 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.080
 but if it turns out more seriously 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.690
 Fifu take it all just 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:28.510
 that bone is simply not there 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.910
 of some possessions of the sword and he zone 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.459
 muddled disposes rubs a lot 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.650
 the number of points does not hit the reference 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.580
 foot in the end anyway it works 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.530
 of course 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.900
 unsuccessfully his choice of composition is pretty 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.840
 slow and not physically strong players 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:48.050
 here is a combination of physics and speed just 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.380
 tears all so more powerful is needed 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.880
 player 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:53.710
 well and so in defense typical mistakes are not 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.930
 professional player 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:58.670
 Sorry sorry so here your to 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.640
 what do you say alexander viktorovich 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:05.690
 Well, yes, and do not need to step onkomed Havana 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:09.470
 Were well on the floor smartly a lot of marriage 40.2 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:11.990
 the portion of the advance is tightened altogether gently 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.630
 passed themselves for such damage it such 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:16.820
 fails so you know at the feet without anyone 50 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:19.820
 belt blows received by his armenian 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:25.180
 Grisha asses should be tougher because 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:25.180
 control the ball there is no best yourself crash 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:31.520
 in the second match a little bit better 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.800
 out of possession but nothing much 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.380
 changed all the goals scored in 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:39.980
 the counter attack is going the same 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:41.900
 the most horror I do not know what I did on why 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:44.750
 it was working in the garage 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:47.330
 some vaccine from Bruno Alves because 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:50.240
 also disgusting playing bruno alves 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:52.460
 how is it and in zenith then remember well and 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.770
 Of course the package there also brought your 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.250
 harem seen pawla in team karpin 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.770
 led 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:00.560
 I decided to motivate the players so it's up 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.960
 motivated package and all defense in 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:06.230
 whole and decide so sieve 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:09.770
 the same well and upward apotheosis 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:11.900
 far to read why not change 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:14.180
 dramatically goalkeepers lodygin not guilty 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:16.820
 none of the missing field that you 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:19.010
 don't know how to play defense not at all 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:22.550
 It means that Lodygin to have this 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:24.320
 direct bearing well, so of course you need 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:26.270
 improve the game in defense 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:30.350
 with ball control you need to somehow 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:33.229
 understand and while everything is sad messy 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:35.120
 playing does not seem to be Constantin better 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:36.240
 I hope to do this 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.410
 everything 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.370
 a little bit somehow dad curiously whether 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:44.819
 A. How is it right here? 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:47.099

00:05:44.819 --> 00:05:50.220
 musa. 

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:53.520
 for which threesomes he scored a goal is increased 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:54.449
 before the assessment of Grisha Grisha he had to higher 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.539
 roofs 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:59.970
 51 percent I'm 2 marks for it 

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:02.340
 well, you know, pavlov, this thing 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:05.460
 to chase can't create these moments 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:05.940
 but they are all in canton as well as work 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:10.319
