00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:13.580
 2 the three points in these points because we share is optimistic that is 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.580
 happening in the world 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.939
 these cases 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.640
 the staff 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.380
 these holidays 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.450
 ja 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.850
 and that working for a lifetime can give you a better future, did you know 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.630
 that after 40 years of work the statistics indicate that people 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.450
 ends in the following way rich 1% camacho 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.350
 those that really independent said 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:49.610
 4 percent let's see how the remaining 95% remains current working 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.570
 5 percent two dead and 36 percent 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.150
 bankrupt alcorcÃ³n 54 percent 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.590
 as soon as he would like to be 5% or in 95 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.750
 I imagine that you do not want to become part of those who are running 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.320
 after tusk money 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.330
 not currently stress has determined the quality of life and the 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:15.020
 Health 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.320
 will be related to the current rhythm of life 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.570
 economic pressures will include 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.640
 To understand the origin of this problem it is necessary to understand what 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.160
 is happening in the global economy and how it affects us 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.900
 we've heard a lot about globalization 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.900
 the truth is that it is imminent 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.610
 successful entrepreneurs warn about perkins the only ones are each 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.350
 become richer and there are more and more poor people 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.440
 They expose in detail how the middle class is disappearing 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.039
 and exposes the importance of preparing us to operate in this new era 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.270
 there is an inevitable fall that the quality of life and gradually we see 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.600
 as economically the middle class is the main mind affected 

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:12.249
 p 

00:02:12.249 --> 00:02:16.930
 but because the middle class is disappearing we are already aware of the 

00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:20.889
 alarming fall of jobs and the crisis derived from this entity 

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:23.170
 in the industry 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.730
 they no longer want to hire fixed positions so they tend to outsource to companies 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.950
 that offer them the same service at a lower cost but optical or companies 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.660
 in our country the big consortiums in india philippines malaysia are 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.039
 absorbing the majority of the market 

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:44.039
 I do not take mergers that are very fashionable 

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:49.499
 after the unification of two or more companies tic is the first thing that they cut 

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:56.169
 or those mentioned between engineering that are increasingly common that is not another 

00:02:56.169 --> 00:03:00.510
 thing that will evaluate and simplify the work between these have not gone to the 

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:05.249
 bankruptcy by the penetration of china products in taiwan chorea in 

00:03:05.249 --> 00:03:10.949
 thailand singapore of our markets 2 what happens with the medical and safety of 

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:14.319
 pensions offered by a traditional job 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.719
 the experts talk about strong reductions in these benefits in 

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:23.329
 both and even in some countries there is talk of a possible technical bankruptcy 

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:27.539
 p 

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:29.199
 twenty 

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:33.999
 it is amazing that alarming that today only 20 percent of the 

00:03:33.999 --> 00:03:37.939
 graduates of universities find work and more delicate 

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:40.549
 is that salaries are mostly 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:45.559
 they do not allow them initiation to recover the expenses of their tuition tip 

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:51.909
 adding up all these elements we understand why the middle class 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:56.349
 tends to disappear even more and more people who face 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:57.900
 this situation 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.000
 he knows what this basically means where you want to be in 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.010
 the next two days like this 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:10.349
 if that entity the definition of madness is to do the same and wait 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:12.409
 different results 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:16.069
 if we want to change that we have to think and play different 

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:20.359
 in that interview and later to the school to get good grades 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:24.180
 get a well-paying job and murder 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.040
 He explained that this adjustment to school is a hard day 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.490
 investor successes 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.900
 two 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.120
 you know it's financial freedom 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:43.010
 financial freedom is to earn the money they need to live but in a way 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.540
 residual the poor work for money 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:52.810
 the rich make their money work for them a point 95% of the 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:58.900
 population this employee employee eye but 95% of the income are 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.830
 generated by the investors their support that their own business 

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.350
 We raise on the other hand how he distributes his money the different 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:12.940
 social classes p the poor they spend spending money and only buy 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.870
 cheap things that the rates of momentary expansion in middle class 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:24.700
 buy responsibilities and obligations the rich they invest in assets 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:29.670
 things that produce them more money analyzes how the rich since it is a 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:32.439
 inexhaustible source of money 

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:34.430
 the poor spend 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:39.419
 the middle class acquires liabilities and the rich acquire assets 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.360
 it seems fair 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.720
 what is not fair 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:48.060
 is that in the existence of this business model there are people who complain 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:49.979
 of the crisis 

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:54.500
 that's why they say that wealth is not a mystery is a formula 

00:05:55.339 --> 00:06:00.380
 the model that we propose allows you to think that act like the big 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:05.200
 to be able to eventually retire financially successful and stop doing 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.129
 things by necessity 

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:11.729
 because if we share this pons to avoid being a victim more of the 

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:14.559
 trends that we mentioned 

00:06:14.559 --> 00:06:17.840
 in the world there are two types of people 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.219
 those of us who work for the money 

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:23.490
 and those who make money worked for it 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:26.229
 if they want the money to work for you 

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:30.979
 We invite you to get in touch with the person who shared that moment
