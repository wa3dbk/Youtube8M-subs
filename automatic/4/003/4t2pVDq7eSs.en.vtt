goes<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.409> me<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.740> help<00:01:10.920> me<00:01:11.070> out<00:01:11.100> I<00:01:11.430> think<00:01:11.610> it's

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
goes to me to help me out I think it's

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.100 
goes to me to help me out I think it's
like<00:01:11.970> three<00:01:12.150> percent<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.810> order<00:01:13.080> or

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
like three percent of the order or

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.450 
like three percent of the order or
something<00:01:13.439> like<00:01:13.530> that

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
something like that

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.980 
something like that
I<00:01:14.490> think<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:14.970> really<00:01:15.299> depends<00:01:15.630> on<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.840> game

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
I think it really depends on the game

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.929 
I think it really depends on the game
but<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.200> think<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.619> majority<00:01:16.860> of<00:01:17.220> its<00:01:17.400> just

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
but I think the majority of its just

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.700 
but I think the majority of its just
like<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.060> flat<00:01:18.360> three<00:01:18.630> percent<00:01:18.960> rate<00:01:19.140> I<00:01:19.320> have<00:01:19.560> to

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
like a flat three percent rate I have to

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.350 
like a flat three percent rate I have to
double-check<00:01:19.979> but<00:01:20.580> I'm<00:01:20.729> almost<00:01:20.880> certain<00:01:21.119> that

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
double-check but I'm almost certain that

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.730 
double-check but I'm almost certain that
is<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.840> so<00:01:22.320> every<00:01:22.650> time<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:23.009> buy<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.220> game<00:01:23.549> it<00:01:23.909> is

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
is it so every time you buy a game it is

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.580 
is it so every time you buy a game it is
supporting<00:01:25.740> me<00:01:25.830> directly<00:01:26.270> so<00:01:27.380> let<00:01:28.380> me<00:01:28.470> go

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
supporting me directly so let me go

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.749
