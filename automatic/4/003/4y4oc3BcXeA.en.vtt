00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 use your clay and we have since we are going to 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:10.580
 book and we advance a lot and now 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:13.090
 let's do now what is our 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:16.150
 body 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:20.560
 let's do here our body that is 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:22.689
 the sphere of another sphere number 7 in the 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.790
 list I place one are two spheres that 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:29.050
 we link that you spend there then friends 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:34.349
 spheres we need to do this 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.349
 this dad the same thing he did initially 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.610
 advance is exactly the same 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.820
 difference is that here I cut in the 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.800
 sphere one centimeter further down the 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.540
 half then point in that repeats to 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.820
 the teachers we are going to leave our 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.800
 sphere we're going to do it here in 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.079
 the small one and let's go forward so that 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.030
 see why the big one is because you 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:58.030
 will use there something from the bottle that 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.970
 comes right here we're going to leave our 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:05.680
 sphere we are going to cut a centimeter 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:07.300
 lower than half because 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.970
 I'm doing it here in reference to 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:13.090
 the sphere number 7 which is the sphere that 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:16.870
 we have left for the jar of mayonnaise 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.490
 we put it and we're going to paste it and 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.680
 let's set exactly as we did 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.750
 head with our template you 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.970

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.890
