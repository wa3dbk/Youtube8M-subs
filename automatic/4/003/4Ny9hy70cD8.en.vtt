00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
mentioned in the beginning this does

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.500 
mentioned in the beginning this does
come<00:02:31.380> included<00:02:31.740> with<00:02:31.770> 12<00:02:32.220> light<00:02:32.459> bulbs<00:02:32.850> for

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
for each of the actual softbox lights

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.060 
for each of the actual softbox lights
and<00:02:37.850> here<00:02:38.850> is<00:02:38.970> what<00:02:39.420> it<00:02:39.510> looks<00:02:39.630> like<00:02:39.780> with<00:02:40.530> all

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
and here is what it looks like with all

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.220 
and here is what it looks like with all
them<00:02:41.340> turned<00:02:41.610> on<00:02:41.790> and<00:02:42.060> if<00:02:42.570> we<00:02:42.690> actually<00:02:43.020> take<00:02:43.170> a

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
them turned on and if we actually take a

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.620 
them turned on and if we actually take a
look<00:02:43.680> around<00:02:43.890> the<00:02:44.459> back<00:02:44.700> we<00:02:45.060> actually<00:02:45.420> have

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
look around the back we actually have

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.199 
look around the back we actually have
two<00:02:46.260> switches<00:02:46.709> to<00:02:46.920> control<00:02:47.310> either<00:02:47.520> the<00:02:47.940> left

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
two switches to control either the left

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.720 
two switches to control either the left
part<00:02:48.510> of<00:02:48.600> the<00:02:48.780> lights<00:02:49.170> or<00:02:49.470> the<00:02:50.040> right<00:02:50.220> part<00:02:50.490> so

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
part of the lights or the right part so

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.790 
part of the lights or the right part so
the<00:02:51.330> left<00:02:51.600> switch<00:02:51.810> will<00:02:52.050> of<00:02:52.140> course<00:02:52.350> control

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
the left switch will of course control

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.380 
the left switch will of course control
the<00:02:53.010> two<00:02:53.190> left<00:02:53.400> bulbs<00:02:53.790> and<00:02:53.970> then<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.150> rights

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
the two left bulbs and then the rights

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.160 
the two left bulbs and then the rights
which<00:02:54.660> will<00:02:55.019> control<00:02:55.380> the<00:02:55.650> right<00:02:55.920> bulbs<00:02:56.910> so<00:02:57.390> it

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
which will control the right bulbs so it

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.660 
which will control the right bulbs so it
only<00:02:58.290> has<00:02:58.560> that<00:02:58.769> and<00:02:59.040> then<00:02:59.160> right<00:02:59.370> below<00:02:59.519> that

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
only has that and then right below that

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.699 
only has that and then right below that
we<00:03:00.060> actually<00:03:00.209> have<00:03:00.600> a<00:03:00.630> little<00:03:00.930> fuse<00:03:01.320> knob

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
we actually have a little fuse knob

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.280 
we actually have a little fuse knob
right<00:03:02.070> there<00:03:02.400> so<00:03:02.940> you<00:03:03.030> can<00:03:03.180> toggle<00:03:03.870> with<00:03:04.110> that

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
right there so you can toggle with that

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.199 
right there so you can toggle with that
as<00:03:04.500> well<00:03:04.530> but<00:03:05.430> as<00:03:05.550> far<00:03:05.730> as<00:03:05.790> the<00:03:06.030> actual

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
as well but as far as the actual

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.570 
as well but as far as the actual
lighting<00:03:06.660> goes<00:03:06.860> we're<00:03:07.860> still<00:03:08.070> not<00:03:08.160> done<00:03:08.220> with

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
lighting goes we're still not done with

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.080 
lighting goes we're still not done with
that<00:03:08.760> we<00:03:09.030> actually<00:03:09.480> have<00:03:09.690> to<00:03:09.840> put<00:03:10.110> this<00:03:10.769> little
