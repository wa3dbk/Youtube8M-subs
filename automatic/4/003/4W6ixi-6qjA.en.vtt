00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
her defense just so she has a good

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.030 
her defense just so she has a good
balance<00:01:57.030> of<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.329> two<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.750> i<00:01:58.409> don't<00:01:58.890> know<00:01:58.950> you

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
balance of the two and i don't know you

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.380 
balance of the two and i don't know you
can<00:01:59.219> do<00:01:59.310> some<00:01:59.490> good<00:01:59.610> damage<00:01:59.909> with<00:02:00.030> that<00:02:00.060> and

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
can do some good damage with that and

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.889 
can do some good damage with that and
you<00:02:00.659> can<00:02:00.810> also<00:02:00.990> hold<00:02:01.320> up<00:02:01.500> your<00:02:01.680> defensive<00:02:02.219> side

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899
