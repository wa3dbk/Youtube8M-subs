00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 
there you go Paris but I wasn't really

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:58.590

sure<00:03:51.500> I<00:03:52.300> got<00:03:53.300> my<00:03:53.570> book<00:03:53.990> out<00:03:54.260> and

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.440 

kind<00:03:59.600> of<00:03:59.720> reminds<00:04:00.080> me<00:04:00.440> maybe<00:04:01.240> of<00:04:02.240> these

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
kind of reminds me maybe of these

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:14.110 
kind of reminds me maybe of these
Hardaway<00:04:03.020> points<00:04:10.810> maybe<00:04:12.580> the<00:04:13.580> dolphin

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120
