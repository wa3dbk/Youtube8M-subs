00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.580
 learning point com 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.700
 and today I decided to show how to read 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.730
 books in kindle or better 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.699
 today I decided to show how to read books 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.580
 the amazon or without having a device 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:25.940
 kindle 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:25.940
 [Music] 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:34.730
 A lot of people are trying to buy mine. 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.770
 book learning stories and not 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.890
 because you think you need a 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.630
 kindle to read and you do not really need 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.489
 so I'm going to show the whole process here 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.200
 from the beginning as if I had not 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:48.020
 an amazon account 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.660
 and for you to buy or download 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:53.480
 free books in amazon you need 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:56.210
 having an account is then the first thing 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.650
 that will make enter a site is here O 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:02.780
 amazon's website 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:05.600
 Aah and make an account so you come 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.000

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:12.920
 new customer begins that it is right here that 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:19.990

 choose password and send account 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:37.560
 that is where he gives some ideas of 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:40.710
 but you do not have to enter 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.469
 much in these configuration ideas you 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.299
 There's already one in your account. Look at the 

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:47.759
 My account is called a test. I'm already inside. 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:51.959
 On my account, I can go back to 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:56.459
 home and now I'll have to 

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:59.149
 download a kindle application are all 

00:01:56.459 --> 00:02:00.990

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:02.880
 most used 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:07.950
 so you have here kindle for iphone 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.660

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.239
 and for windows 8 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.060

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:18.180

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:30.720

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:35.569
 Send download you will enter 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:39.810
 here's a low button now 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:41.489
 So, come on, I uninstalled it. 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.569
 application that I had in my 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:48.090
 machine and and I decided to download the kindle for 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:50.970
 pc without being to windows 8 despite the 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.760
 my machines and windows 8 is a tip 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.040
 What is left for you to install the fifth to 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.739
 pc windows 8 you will have to pass 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.590
 by microsoft application store 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:04.530
 I would rather do an installation 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:07.440
 for windows 7 below that works 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.170
 anyway it's already downloaded 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:16.560
 here I'll just run to 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:20.540
 you see installation windows complains 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.540
 I always have to do it 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.660
 so come on, this is the screen that goes 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:29.880
 appear when you open your 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.960
 kindle application for the first time in 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.990
 your computer 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:37.770
 and it's time for you to use that account 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:40.920
 you created here you will notice that 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:44.670
 here are some books already inside 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:48.180
 of my fifth because I had already 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:51.690
 registered, my account is neither real nor 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:54.570
 account you actually use inside is this 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.860
 application and then I undo this record 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.120
 to show the process of 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.630
 registration for you 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:08.990
 so I 'm going to put the account here that I 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:08.990

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:21.959
 Synchronizing here does not have new items 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.330

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:27.330

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.130

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.130
 Here I am going to use my 

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:49.369
 I already showed here 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:56.029
 ah and I'll make the purchase with the click 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.720
 from there you have simply two 

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:04.690
 registration screens with some data 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:08.849
 You fill these two screens 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:08.849
 and then your account is all ready 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:16.290

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.320
 automatically over here 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:27.120
 then windows gives me a little complain 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.540
 always remember your choice was 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:33.630
 start the application 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:36.480
 then it will do what it will download 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:37.770
 the book is here in your case is going 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.170
 this book appears 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:44.250
 then you double-click and start reading 

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:49.800
 that's right it starts in text you're 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:51.900

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:55.980
 he can go to a story 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:59.160
 specific and so on 

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:01.350
 there are other functions here 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.270
 here is all the content that you 

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:07.560
 You want to look at the cover? 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:12.390
 So it's your book and ready for 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:15.690
 be read inside your computer is the 

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:17.130
 process for mobile devices is very 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:20.340
 similar to the installation of any 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:22.940
 application you go to your store 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:25.800
 device be android be ipad 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:28.980
 install the kindle application that is 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:31.980
 free and is from this application 

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:34.860
 you register and you can make the 

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:36.330
 purchase of your book in my case here was 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.800
 a zero value purchase 

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:41.430
 if it is not a zero-value purchase 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:44.220
 amazon will ask you for a credit card 

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:47.220
 It's okay so I hope with that. 

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:50.820
 be clearer what you need 

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:54.360
 do to read your amazon books 

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:57.180
 even without having a yard and that this 

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:59.910
 let's make good use of this store that 

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:01.350
 It's getting there and it's here. 

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:03.000
 revolutionize the book market 

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:04.110
 the Brazilian market revolutionized the 

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.620
 American 

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:11.400
 It's okay, so I'm going to stay here.
