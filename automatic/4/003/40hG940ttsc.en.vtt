00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.300
 18 thousand years ago the huge glaciers had a third of the earth 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.300
 in its icy claws 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:15.969
 these rivers of ice made their way through the mountains 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:19.679
 they smashed the great works 

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:22.679
 and flattened the surface 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:27.899
 then the temperature started to rise 

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:30.899
 the glaciers began to retreat and changed the landscape 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.960
 the glaciers helped the lakes and the fertile ones to form 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.130
 Midwest lands the fjords the peaks of patagonia and the valley 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.130
 yosemite in california 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.070
 in this place the glaciers destroyed everything in its way through the mountains 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.780
 they formed u-shaped ball and they left steep precipices like the cadastre 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.100
 A glacier forms when the snow begins to fall faster than it does 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.270
 take melt when increasing the weight is compressed 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.380
 the light flakes become granular over the years 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.950
 increases the weight of snow accumulated on top 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.430
 the ice starts to move under its own weight 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.770
 here there are no fines for speeding 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.770
 sky moves 2 centimeters per day 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.140
 the bottom layer moves more slowly because the earth stops it 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.870
 the tension breaks the ice creating gigantic cracks 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.900
 warming at the end of the glacial period reduced the glaciers but did not 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.300
 they finished 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.080
 today more than a tenth of the earth is still covered by the 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.910
 ice 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.910
 and the ice made treasure of information 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.599
 every year the scientist with the largest cape measures the glacier of colombia in 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:13.599
 alaska to forecast weather trends 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.499
 the colombia barreto yielded 12 kilometers from added queen 

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:22.509
 from the pile of rubble left at the end of the glaciation 

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:29.169
 when reduced, the huge countries with a 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:33.159
 nobody knows for sure if this is due to warming 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:36.769
 skid if it is part of the natural temperature cycle 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:45.909
 scientists discover the history of the earth's climate by studying the 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:48.909
 air trapped in the ice 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:54.239
 and they ignore the current climate to look for clues of the next period 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:54.790
 glacial
