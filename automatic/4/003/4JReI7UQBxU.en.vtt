00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:08.690
 the electric lines are an invention 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:10.850
 Recent everyday energize 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.500
 our small appliances and 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:16.450
 according to the story they were invented in 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.450
 the year 1800 or maybe not 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.070
 and because we talk the question with 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.080
 criterion because even though you 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.449
 it seems incredible the archeology between 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.119
 his banned pieces has one that 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:30.859
 exceeds the limits of surprise is 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.570
 it's about an electric battery with more 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:35.930
 2000 years old and was 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.519
 found in the year 1938 in Iraq what 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.170
 the scholars found were about 

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:41.000
 Vase-shaped containers that 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.370
 they contained a strange inside 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.680
 copper cylinder surrounding a rod 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.659
 of iron and as is logical 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.079
 scientists looked for meaning that 

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:50.079
 find 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.800
 the first exams determined their 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:01:00.410
 antiquity dated from 227 years 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.390
 and 126 before Christ the main 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.519
 researcher the virgin german engineer 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.409
 koning filling the containers with a 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:10.479
 conventional electrolyte for your 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.479
 surprise the metal rod is active 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.700
 four years later a first one was signed 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.950
 scientific report the content of the 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.360
 vessels assured works exactly 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.360
 just like a modern electric row 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:30.520
 years later an engineer called 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:33.070
 william gray from aguas de irak liked 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.600
 more sides on the strange artifact and 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.119
 he decided to make a peculiar 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.039
 experiment built a replica of the 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.719
 row and as alkaline liquid wanted 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:42.340
 use any element that was at 

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:45.039
 reach of the inhabitants of iraq of 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.929
 2000 years ago said liquid was not another 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:48.670
 more than grape juice then in a 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:51.039
 vessel introduced a respectable 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:54.929
 amount of the solution and immersed in its 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:54.929
 inside a small silver figurine 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:03.850
 immediately applied the current of his 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.740
 replica to the supposed row of cows the 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.960
 result the experience was the most 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.060
 disturbing in two hours and how 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.890
 consequence of the electrical action the 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.500
 Silver figurine has a coloration 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.780
 markedly golden , she had no doubts 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.670
 that strange and although rudimentary 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:23.490
 artifact had been two millennia ago 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.490
 nothing more and nothing less than an electric row 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.310
 archaeological investigations 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.720
 later uncovered the presence 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.970
 between the ruins of irak of new 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.920
 similar bacteria some even of 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.920
 greater power than the one we refer to here 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.959
 the skeptics assure that life does not 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.480
 it's more than a case to keep 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.620
 scrolls and cosmetics never 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.140
 they have been able to demonstrate 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.819
 there are also suspicions of the existence of 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.680
 more batteries of these characteristics 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:59.200
 developed by the peoples of the past 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.760
 today the piece that occupies us is 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.760
 in the archaeological museum of Baghdad 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.410
 however the enigma according to some 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.660
 affirmations has been buried under 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.340
 one of the museum allegedly destroyed 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.190
 during the bombing of the city 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:20.319
 Iraqi two thousand years later has returned from 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.319
 new to be buried under ruin
