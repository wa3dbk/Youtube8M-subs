00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:41.940 
screwed up a couple times so yeah I
might<00:02:40.150> be<00:02:40.270> justified<00:02:40.780> in<00:02:41.080> letting<00:02:41.380> him<00:02:41.470> go<00:02:41.709> but

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
might be justified in letting him go but

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:42.839 
might be justified in letting him go but
if<00:02:42.040> you<00:02:42.099> do<00:02:42.220> you<00:02:42.370> got<00:02:42.489> to<00:02:42.580> deal<00:02:42.730> with

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 
if you do you got to deal with

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:44.880 
if you do you got to deal with
consequences<00:02:43.480> and<00:02:43.690> all<00:02:43.810> that<00:02:43.959> unhappy<00:02:44.590> shit

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
consequences and all that unhappy shit

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.229 
consequences and all that unhappy shit
now<00:02:45.069> I<00:02:45.099> say<00:02:45.340> episode<00:02:45.700> because<00:02:45.940> the<00:02:46.060> game

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
now I say episode because the game

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.420 
now I say episode because the game
breaks<00:02:46.510> itself<00:02:46.810> up<00:02:47.080> among<00:02:47.380> five<00:02:47.620> episodes<00:02:48.160> and

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
breaks itself up among five episodes and

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:49.920 
breaks itself up among five episodes and
the<00:02:48.550> cool<00:02:48.760> gimmick<00:02:49.090> of<00:02:49.330> the<00:02:49.390> whole<00:02:49.540> thing<00:02:49.750> is

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
the cool gimmick of the whole thing is

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.840 
the cool gimmick of the whole thing is
an<00:02:50.080> episode<00:02:50.440> came<00:02:50.680> out<00:02:50.890> every<00:02:51.220> month<00:02:51.670> and<00:02:51.790> a

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
an episode came out every month and a

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.460 
an episode came out every month and a
half<00:02:51.880> or<00:02:52.180> two<00:02:52.239> months<00:02:52.600> or<00:02:52.690> so<00:02:52.840> so<00:02:53.110> people<00:02:53.230> would

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
half or two months or so so people would

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.320 
half or two months or so so people would
play<00:02:53.680> one<00:02:53.920> episode<00:02:54.310> each<00:02:54.520> episodes<00:02:55.000> only<00:02:55.120> like

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
play one episode each episodes only like

does<00:03:29.530> I<00:03:29.799> mean<00:03:29.830> I<00:03:29.980> imagine<00:03:30.069> they<00:03:30.430> did<00:03:30.610> it<00:03:30.700> this

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819 
does I mean I imagine they did it this

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:32.729 
does I mean I imagine they did it this
way<00:03:30.880> because<00:03:31.299> it<00:03:31.420> takes<00:03:31.630> less<00:03:31.930> production<00:03:32.620> to

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
way because it takes less production to

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:34.199 
way because it takes less production to
get<00:03:32.920> it<00:03:33.040> done<00:03:33.280> they<00:03:33.519> don't<00:03:33.549> have<00:03:33.760> to<00:03:33.880> find

take nine years to make there are a
couple<00:03:38.560> times<00:03:38.890> in<00:03:39.040> this<00:03:39.130> game<00:03:39.190> my<00:03:39.609> job<00:03:39.970> was<00:03:40.239> on

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
couple times in this game my job was on

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:41.729 
couple times in this game my job was on
the<00:03:40.390> floor<00:03:40.720> I<00:03:40.780> was<00:03:40.900> just<00:03:41.140> like<00:03:41.290> I<00:03:41.470> can't

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
the floor I was just like I can't

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:43.020 
the floor I was just like I can't
believe<00:03:41.859> that<00:03:42.040> just<00:03:42.430> happened

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
believe that just happened

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:45.210 
believe that just happened
well<00:03:43.180> it<00:03:43.390> takes<00:03:43.600> a<00:03:43.780> lot<00:03:44.079> for<00:03:44.109> a<00:03:44.410> game<00:03:44.709> to<00:03:44.950> drive

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
well it takes a lot for a game to drive

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.430 
well it takes a lot for a game to drive
me<00:03:45.459> to<00:03:45.489> that<00:03:45.760> point<00:03:46.060> I<00:03:46.269> was<00:03:46.480> genuinely<00:03:46.870> in

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
me to that point I was genuinely in

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.470 
me to that point I was genuinely in
disbelief<00:03:47.739> of<00:03:48.340> the<00:03:48.430> situation<00:03:49.090> and<00:03:49.209> where<00:03:49.450> the

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
disbelief of the situation and where the

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.900 
disbelief of the situation and where the
game<00:03:49.810> really<00:03:49.840> shines<00:03:50.500> is<00:03:51.100> the<00:03:51.130> relationship

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
game really shines is the relationship

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:53.759 
game really shines is the relationship
between<00:03:51.940> Lee<00:03:52.570> and<00:03:52.600> Clementine<00:03:53.530> the

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
between Lee and Clementine the

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:55.199 
between Lee and Clementine the
relationship<00:03:54.280> between<00:03:54.430> the<00:03:54.700> character<00:03:55.090> you

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
relationship between the character you

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:57.210 
relationship between the character you
play<00:03:55.239> and<00:03:55.750> this<00:03:55.959> little<00:03:56.260> girl<00:03:56.470> it<00:03:56.650> had<00:03:56.890> to<00:03:57.100> be

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
play and this little girl it had to be

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:58.650 
play and this little girl it had to be
good<00:03:57.430> otherwise<00:03:57.700> this<00:03:58.000> game<00:03:58.239> would<00:03:58.390> just<00:03:58.540> be

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
good otherwise this game would just be

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.539 
good otherwise this game would just be
