them together as a triad a chord like

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.240 
them together as a triad a chord like
this<00:02:07.750> we<00:02:08.750> call<00:02:08.930> that<00:02:09.110> initiating<00:02:09.950> them<00:02:10.070> or

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
this we call that initiating them or

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.630 
this we call that initiating them or
playing<00:02:10.640> them<00:02:10.760> separately<00:02:12.040> and<00:02:13.040> when<00:02:13.280> I<00:02:13.310> talk

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
playing them separately and when I talk

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.040 
playing them separately and when I talk
about<00:02:13.760> chord<00:02:14.120> tones<00:02:14.360> I'm<00:02:14.570> talking<00:02:14.990> about

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
about chord tones I'm talking about

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.250 
about chord tones I'm talking about
those<00:02:15.380> three<00:02:15.820> see<00:02:16.820> EMG<00:02:17.330> are<00:02:17.630> the<00:02:17.780> chord<00:02:18.050> tones

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
those three see EMG are the chord tones

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.670 
those three see EMG are the chord tones
of<00:02:18.620> the<00:02:18.800> C<00:02:18.950> chord<00:02:19.250> F<00:02:19.790> AC<00:02:20.210> is<00:02:20.690> the<00:02:20.870> are<00:02:21.260> the<00:02:21.410> chord

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
of the C chord F AC is the are the chord

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.980 
of the C chord F AC is the are the chord
tones<00:02:21.920> of<00:02:22.220> the<00:02:22.430> F<00:02:22.580> chord<00:02:22.880> and<00:02:23.180> I<00:02:23.510> can<00:02:23.660> play<00:02:23.810> that

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
tones of the F chord and I can play that

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:39.640 
tones of the F chord and I can play that
chord<00:02:24.170> like<00:02:24.380> this<00:02:38.200> will<00:02:39.200> tell<00:02:39.380> you<00:02:39.470> which<00:02:39.620> one

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
chord like this will tell you which one

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:45.640 
chord like this will tell you which one
you're<00:02:40.010> gonna<00:02:40.100> play<00:02:40.480> so<00:02:42.220> the<00:02:43.220> C<00:02:43.730> chord<00:02:44.620> the<00:02:45.620> G

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
you're gonna play so the C chord the G

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.780 
you're gonna play so the C chord the G
chord<00:02:46.100> go<00:02:46.580> to<00:02:46.640> G<00:02:46.910> play<00:02:47.450> skip<00:02:48.110> play<00:02:48.620> skip<00:02:49.220> so<00:02:49.700> we

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
chord go to G play skip play skip so we

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.010 
chord go to G play skip play skip so we
have<00:02:49.880> G<00:02:50.120> B<00:02:50.720> and<00:02:50.990> D<00:02:51.050> the<00:02:51.620> G<00:02:51.830> chord<00:02:52.630> so<00:02:53.630> those<00:02:53.870> are

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
have G B and D the G chord so those are

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.320 
have G B and D the G chord so those are
the<00:02:54.110> core<00:02:54.320> tones<00:02:54.620> of<00:02:54.770> the<00:02:54.800> G<00:02:55.070> chord<00:02:55.280> now<00:02:55.880> in<00:02:56.180> the

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
the core tones of the G chord now in the

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.770 
the core tones of the G chord now in the
key<00:02:56.480> of<00:02:56.510> C<00:02:56.870> let's<00:02:57.830> start<00:02:58.070> on<00:02:58.220> C<00:02:58.520> and<00:02:58.790> say<00:02:59.060> that<00:02:59.390> C

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
key of C let's start on C and say that C

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.900 
key of C let's start on C and say that C
in<00:03:00.110> this<00:03:00.410> particular<00:03:00.740> situation<00:03:01.100> is<00:03:01.610> the<00:03:01.760> one

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
in this particular situation is the one

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.790 
in this particular situation is the one
chord<00:03:02.209> because<00:03:02.570> it<00:03:02.900> is<00:03:03.050> the<00:03:03.230> first<00:03:03.560> part<00:03:03.709> of

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:03.800 
chord because it is the first part of

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.770 
chord because it is the first part of
the<00:03:03.890> scale<00:03:04.100> now<00:03:04.700> when<00:03:04.910> you<00:03:05.030> go<00:03:05.150> to<00:03:05.180> neverkey

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
the scale now when you go to neverkey

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.600 
the scale now when you go to neverkey
the<00:03:06.170> one<00:03:06.350> becomes<00:03:06.709> something<00:03:06.950> else<00:03:07.130> we<00:03:07.459> call

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
the one becomes something else we call

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.150 
the one becomes something else we call
that<00:03:07.730> a<00:03:07.790> moveable<00:03:08.300> dough<00:03:08.450> that<00:03:08.750> means<00:03:09.160> that

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
that a moveable dough that means that

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.949 
that a moveable dough that means that
one<00:03:10.459> in<00:03:10.700> this<00:03:10.970> particular<00:03:11.420> key<00:03:11.720> has<00:03:11.930> a

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
one in this particular key has a

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:13.660 
one in this particular key has a
different<00:03:12.320> function<00:03:12.530> than<00:03:12.920> the<00:03:13.250> one<00:03:13.370> in<00:03:13.489> half

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
different function than the one in half

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
the one chord a nap would be the F chord

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.160 
the one chord a nap would be the F chord
the<00:03:16.190> one<00:03:16.370> in<00:03:16.550> C<00:03:16.820> is<00:03:17.060> the<00:03:17.270> C<00:03:17.420> chord<00:03:17.720> so<00:03:18.020> that

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
the one in C is the C chord so that

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.930 
the one in C is the C chord so that
means<00:03:18.380> that<00:03:18.530> you<00:03:18.620> have<00:03:18.680> to<00:03:18.890> renumber<00:03:19.310> all<00:03:19.700> of

improvising<00:04:58.660> is<00:04:59.169> just<00:04:59.470> knowing<00:04:59.680> the<00:04:59.889> quarks

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
improvising is just knowing the quarks

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.190 
improvising is just knowing the quarks
that<00:05:00.280> go<00:05:00.460> by<00:05:00.639> and<00:05:00.880> be<00:05:01.000> able<00:05:01.090> to<00:05:01.240> play<00:05:01.479> the<00:05:01.960> chord

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.200 
that go by and be able to play the chord

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:03.810 
that go by and be able to play the chord
tones<00:05:02.380> of<00:05:02.710> the<00:05:02.800> chords<00:05:03.070> that<00:05:03.130> go<00:05:03.250> by<00:05:03.490> that's

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
tones of the chords that go by that's

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.670 
tones of the chords that go by that's
the<00:05:04.000> first<00:05:04.240> step<00:05:04.510> in<00:05:04.750> my<00:05:04.900> opinion<00:05:05.289> to

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
the first step in my opinion to

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.980 
the first step in my opinion to
improvisation<00:05:06.340> is<00:05:06.460> knowing<00:05:06.850> what<00:05:07.600> what's

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
improvisation is knowing what what's

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.050 
improvisation is knowing what what's
what<00:05:08.650> notice<00:05:09.160> we<00:05:09.250> have<00:05:09.370> to<00:05:09.460> work<00:05:09.610> with<00:05:09.820> and

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
what notice we have to work with and

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.420 
what notice we have to work with and
then<00:05:10.330> maybe<00:05:10.810> going<00:05:11.050> okay<00:05:11.380> this<00:05:11.860> time<00:05:11.889> I'm

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
then maybe going okay this time I'm

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.279 
then maybe going okay this time I'm
gonna<00:05:12.580> do<00:05:12.789> the<00:05:12.910> scale

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:16.289 

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:19.639 

I<00:05:16.349> made<00:05:16.919> some<00:05:17.270> repetition<00:05:18.270> on<00:05:18.629> some<00:05:19.020> notes<00:05:19.259> but

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:19.649 
I made some repetition on some notes but

00:05:19.649 --> 00:05:21.439 
I made some repetition on some notes but
I<00:05:19.680> just<00:05:19.979> played<00:05:20.219> the<00:05:20.249> C<00:05:20.520> scale<00:05:20.729> when<00:05:21.149> you<00:05:21.180> do

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:21.449 
I just played the C scale when you do

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:23.389 
I just played the C scale when you do
that<00:05:21.599> anything<00:05:22.409> that's<00:05:22.740> not<00:05:22.889> the<00:05:23.039> melody

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:23.399 
that anything that's not the melody

00:05:23.399 --> 00:05:24.320 
that anything that's not the melody
sounds<00:05:23.759> great

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:24.330 
sounds great

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.239 
sounds great
as<00:05:24.509> long<00:05:24.659> as<00:05:24.689> it's<00:05:24.990> different<00:05:25.529> has<00:05:25.919> a<00:05:25.949> little

00:05:26.239 --> 00:05:26.249 
as long as it's different has a little

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:27.920 
as long as it's different has a little
rhythm<00:05:26.639> you<00:05:26.759> can<00:05:26.879> use<00:05:26.999> repetition<00:05:27.210> the<00:05:27.749> things

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
rhythm you can use repetition the things
