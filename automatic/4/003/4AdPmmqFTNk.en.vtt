native<00:00:47.640> just<00:00:48.640> to<00:00:48.790> see<00:00:49.059> what<00:00:49.180> kind<00:00:49.239> of<00:00:49.360> results

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
native just to see what kind of results

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.840 
native just to see what kind of results
we<00:00:49.719> get<00:00:49.899> we're<00:00:50.050> obviously<00:00:50.200> gonna<00:00:50.590> get<00:00:51.160> barely

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:51.850 
we get we're obviously gonna get barely

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.799 
we get we're obviously gonna get barely
acceptable<00:00:52.270> results<00:00:52.780> I<00:00:52.899> would<00:00:53.079> say<00:00:53.290> but<00:00:53.710> I

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
acceptable results I would say but I

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.340 
acceptable results I would say but I
have<00:00:55.809> played<00:00:56.020> at<00:00:56.200> this<00:00:56.410> resolution<00:00:56.710> before

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
have played at this resolution before

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.720 
have played at this resolution before
this<00:00:59.350> comes<00:00:59.559> a<00:00:59.620> bit<00:00:59.770> slower<00:01:00.100> so<00:01:00.520> they<00:01:00.670> were

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:00.730 
this comes a bit slower so they were

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:11.489 
this comes a bit slower so they were
down<00:01:01.149> to<00:01:01.270> 16<00:01:01.660> frames<00:01:01.960> a<00:01:02.140> second<00:01:08.819> 18<00:01:10.319> and<00:01:11.319> she's

00:01:11.489 --> 00:01:11.499 
down to 16 frames a second 18 and she's

00:01:11.499 --> 00:01:17.080 
down to 16 frames a second 18 and she's
definitely<00:01:11.679> sluggish

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.819 

18<00:01:17.960> 19<00:01:18.140> frames<00:01:18.619> a<00:01:18.860> second<00:01:19.780> definitely<00:01:20.829> not

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:21.829 
18 19 frames a second definitely not

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:28.960 
18 19 frames a second definitely not
acceptable<00:01:24.070> it's<00:01:25.450> it's<00:01:26.450> okay<00:01:26.899> but<00:01:27.789> I'd<00:01:28.789> say

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
acceptable it's it's okay but I'd say

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:36.399 
acceptable it's it's okay but I'd say
this<00:01:29.090> when<00:01:29.240> you<00:01:29.329> call<00:01:29.539> very<00:01:29.840> accessible<00:01:35.409> get

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
this when you call very accessible get

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.279 
this when you call very accessible get
another<00:01:36.590> weapon<00:01:36.740> yet<00:01:37.509> okay<00:01:38.509> like<00:01:38.840> am<00:01:38.929> I<00:01:39.049> wrong

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:39.289 
another weapon yet okay like am I wrong

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:40.380 
another weapon yet okay like am I wrong

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
so 17 16 17 frames of seconds so anyhow

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:51.850 
so 17 16 17 frames of seconds so anyhow
not<00:01:50.780> bad<00:01:50.990> so<00:01:51.229> yeah<00:01:51.409> we're<00:01:51.530> gonna<00:01:51.590> come<00:01:51.830> back
