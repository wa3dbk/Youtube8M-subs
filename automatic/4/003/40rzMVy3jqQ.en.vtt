00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
underneath it this allows the heat from

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.280 
underneath it this allows the heat from
the<00:02:41.370> components<00:02:42.030> to<00:02:42.540> escape<00:02:42.840> fastened

the components to escape fastened

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.680 
the components to escape fastened
directly<00:02:43.380> from<00:02:43.770> the<00:02:43.980> you<00:02:44.310> 360<00:02:44.910> instead<00:02:45.600> of

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
directly from the you 360 instead of

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.340 
directly from the you 360 instead of
traveling<00:02:46.170> on<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:46.350> old<00:02:46.500> 360<00:02:47.060> to<00:02:48.060> the<00:02:48.150> top<00:02:48.480> or

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
than the old previous 360 this is really

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:02.480 
than the old previous 360 this is really
worth<00:04:01.980> the<00:04:02.160> money

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:02.490 
worth the money

worth the money
it<00:04:03.330> barely<00:04:03.600> gets<00:04:03.870> hot<00:04:04.050> the<00:04:04.590> only<00:04:04.710> part<00:04:04.920> it<00:04:05.130> gets

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
it barely gets hot the only part it gets

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.740 
it barely gets hot the only part it gets
hot<00:04:05.400> is<00:04:05.700> right<00:04:05.880> here<00:04:06.120> and<00:04:06.360> that's<00:04:06.450> where<00:04:06.570> the

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
hot is right here and that's where the

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.750 
hot is right here and that's where the
heat<00:04:06.959> shoots<00:04:07.680> out<00:04:07.800> directly<00:04:08.220> from<00:04:08.490> the

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
heat shoots out directly from the

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.170 
heat shoots out directly from the
components<00:04:09.240> and<00:04:10.040> here's<00:04:11.040> the<00:04:11.700> new<00:04:11.820> control

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180

new 360 but I know that the Xbox used to

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.530 
new 360 but I know that the Xbox used to
these<00:04:30.930> remote<00:04:31.229> works<00:04:31.680> I've<00:04:32.100> tried<00:04:32.430> before<00:04:32.610> so
