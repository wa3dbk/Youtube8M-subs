flipped learning I think on a really

flipped learning I think on a really
basic<00:00:14.130> level<00:00:14.519> is<00:00:14.880> taking<00:00:15.719> what<00:00:15.990> has

traditionally<00:00:16.650> been<00:00:17.010> given<00:00:17.699> in<00:00:17.789> a<00:00:17.880> lecture<00:00:18.090> in

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
terms of direct instruction and shifting

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.070

that<00:00:20.490> out<00:00:20.730> of<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.000> class<00:00:21.210> time<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:21.689> then

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
that out of the class time and then

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.380 
that out of the class time and then
using<00:00:22.769> that<00:00:22.800> recuperated<00:00:23.550> time<00:00:23.760> more<00:00:24.150> wisely

the<00:00:29.490> way<00:00:29.609> I<00:00:29.640> got<00:00:29.939> started<00:00:29.970> doing<00:00:30.480> this<00:00:30.599> is<00:00:30.840> I

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
the way I got started doing this is I

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.359 
the way I got started doing this is I
just<00:00:31.140> started<00:00:31.349> recording<00:00:31.590> my<00:00:31.740> lessons<00:00:32.160> live

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
just started recording my lessons live

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.830 
just started recording my lessons live
for<00:00:32.669> my<00:00:32.759> students<00:00:33.149> who<00:00:33.210> were<00:00:33.300> missing<00:00:33.630> class

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
for my students who were missing class

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.350 
for my students who were missing class
and<00:00:34.230> posting<00:00:35.160> those<00:00:35.309> online<00:00:35.489> for<00:00:36.059> them<00:00:36.180> as<00:00:36.329> a

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
and posting those online for them as a

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.690 
and posting those online for them as a
resource<00:00:36.570> they<00:00:37.530> get<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.770> access<00:00:37.920> it<00:00:38.370> when<00:00:38.579> they

want<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.149> that<00:00:39.390> could<00:00:39.540> be<00:00:39.629> at<00:00:39.719> 10<00:00:39.840> o'clock

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930

they<00:00:44.879> have<00:00:45.030> control<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.420> that<00:00:45.539> students<00:00:46.440> would

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
they have control of that students would

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.020 
they have control of that students would
watch<00:00:46.739> those<00:00:47.070> before<00:00:47.550> they<00:00:47.640> came<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.879> class

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
watch those before they came to class

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.790 
watch those before they came to class
and<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.719> class<00:00:48.870> time<00:00:49.170> was<00:00:49.350> work<00:00:49.530> time

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
and the class time was work time

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.799 
and the class time was work time
engaging<00:00:50.489> in<00:00:50.760> some<00:00:50.910> some<00:00:51.360> higher<00:00:51.539> order

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
engaging in some some higher order

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.569 
engaging in some some higher order
thinking<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:53.039> wit<00:00:53.190> so<00:00:53.309> we<00:00:53.399> didn't<00:00:53.550> have

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
thinking and the wit so we didn't have

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:54.979 
thinking and the wit so we didn't have
to<00:00:53.730> use<00:00:53.910> our<00:00:54.239> class<00:00:54.390> time<00:00:54.600> for<00:00:54.660> direct

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
to use our class time for direct

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.479 
to use our class time for direct
instruction<00:00:55.469> we<00:00:55.559> could<00:00:55.680> shift<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:56.070> out<00:00:56.250> of

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
instruction we could shift that out of

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.189 
instruction we could shift that out of
the<00:00:56.550> class

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:02.540 

there's<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.260> site<00:01:01.530> where<00:01:01.769> we<00:01:01.859> go<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.430> watch

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
there's a site where we go to and watch

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.249 
there's a site where we go to and watch
our<00:01:02.670> podcast<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.269> it<00:01:03.329> has<00:01:03.480> like<00:01:03.750> all<00:01:03.989> the

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:04.259 
our podcast and it has like all the

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:06.170 
our podcast and it has like all the
units<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:05.159> during<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.610> class<00:01:05.759> period<00:01:05.940> we're

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
units and during the class period we're

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.300 
units and during the class period we're
doing<00:01:06.330> labs<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:07.020> applying<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.920> skills<00:01:08.130> if

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
doing labs and applying the skills if

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.859 
doing labs and applying the skills if
you<00:01:08.400> don't<00:01:08.549> get<00:01:08.670> home<00:01:08.759> I<00:01:09.090> wish<00:01:09.450> more<00:01:09.720> people

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
you don't get home I wish more people

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.170 
you don't get home I wish more people
would<00:01:10.110> do<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.350> flipped<00:01:10.590> classroom<00:01:10.890> I<00:01:11.490> think

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
would do the flipped classroom I think

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.300 
would do the flipped classroom I think
it<00:01:12.270> definitely<00:01:12.630> works<00:01:12.840> for<00:01:13.020> every<00:01:13.560> speed<00:01:14.070> of

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
it definitely works for every speed of

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.370 
it definitely works for every speed of
learner<00:01:14.580> if<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.390> student<00:01:15.750> is<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.869> fast<00:01:16.200> learner

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
learner if a student is a fast learner

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.050 
learner if a student is a fast learner
they<00:01:16.950> can<00:01:17.100> go<00:01:17.250> through<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.580> material<00:01:17.970> as

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
they can go through the material as

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.840 
they can go through the material as
quickly<00:01:18.330> as<00:01:18.540> they<00:01:18.659> want<00:01:18.899> the<00:01:19.890> slower<00:01:20.369> learners

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
quickly as they want the slower learners

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.300 
quickly as they want the slower learners
the<00:01:21.210> students<00:01:21.690> who<00:01:21.750> struggle<00:01:22.159> they<00:01:23.159> have

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
the students who struggle they have

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.950 
the students who struggle they have
control<00:01:23.700> of<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.909> rate<00:01:24.149> at<00:01:24.330> which<00:01:24.360> they<00:01:24.690> learn

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
control of the rate at which they learn

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.719 
control of the rate at which they learn
the<00:01:25.289> materials<00:01:25.710> so<00:01:25.890> they<00:01:26.190> can<00:01:26.310> pause<00:01:26.520> the

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
the materials so they can pause the

the materials so they can pause the
teacher<00:01:26.909> they<00:01:27.270> can<00:01:27.299> rewind<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.930> teacher<00:01:28.110> they

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
can view it multiple times if they need

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.960 
can view it multiple times if they need
to<00:01:30.800> if<00:01:31.800> everyone's<00:01:32.280> not<00:01:32.429> doing<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.789> same

my<00:01:35.130> class<00:01:35.399> looks<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.820> little<00:01:35.940> chaotic<00:01:36.179> it<00:01:37.170> looks

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
my class looks a little chaotic it looks

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.529 
my class looks a little chaotic it looks
like<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.740> spring<00:01:38.460> circus<00:01:38.819> of<00:01:38.940> learning<00:01:39.300> is<00:01:39.390> what

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:39.539 
like a spring circus of learning is what

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:43.660 
like a spring circus of learning is what
I<00:01:39.569> call<00:01:39.810> it

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.550 

I<00:01:43.700> also<00:01:44.600> give<00:01:44.840> them<00:01:44.869> the<00:01:45.049> option<00:01:45.380> if<00:01:45.470> they

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
I also give them the option if they

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.780 
I also give them the option if they
don't<00:01:45.680> want<00:01:45.799> to<00:01:45.860> take<00:01:46.009> my<00:01:46.159> test<00:01:46.490> to

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
don't want to take my test to

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.429 
don't want to take my test to
demonstrate<00:01:47.210> their<00:01:47.659> understanding<00:01:47.689> some

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 
demonstrate their understanding some

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:49.870 
demonstrate their understanding some
other<00:01:48.590> way<00:01:48.799> so<00:01:49.159> I<00:01:49.189> have<00:01:49.369> students<00:01:49.670> making

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
other way so I have students making

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.570 
other way so I have students making
video<00:01:50.240> games<00:01:50.299> reading<00:01:51.200> comic<00:01:51.560> books<00:01:51.590> creating

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
video games reading comic books creating

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.670 
video games reading comic books creating
art<00:01:52.729> projects<00:01:53.360> so<00:01:54.049> yeah<00:01:54.200> the<00:01:54.320> sky<00:01:54.530> is<00:01:54.590> the

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:54.680 
art projects so yeah the sky is the

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.899 
art projects so yeah the sky is the
limit<00:01:54.740> whatever<00:01:55.100> they<00:01:55.280> want<00:01:55.430> to<00:01:55.490> do<00:01:55.580> as<00:01:55.759> long

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
limit whatever they want to do as long

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.300 
limit whatever they want to do as long
as<00:01:56.060> they<00:01:56.180> can<00:01:57.020> prove<00:01:57.439> to<00:01:57.590> me<00:01:57.680> that<00:01:57.710> they<00:01:57.860> that

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
as they can prove to me that they that

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.710 
as they can prove to me that they that
they<00:01:58.490> get<00:01:58.729> it<00:01:58.880> that<00:01:59.030> they're<00:01:59.180> learning<00:01:59.360> that

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
they get it that they're learning that

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.060 
they get it that they're learning that
they<00:01:59.810> understand<00:02:00.200> these<00:02:00.350> things<00:02:00.530> and<00:02:00.860> it's

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
they understand these things and it's

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.930 
they understand these things and it's
good<00:02:01.220> enough<00:02:01.340> for<00:02:01.430> me<00:02:03.610> there's<00:02:04.610> a<00:02:04.670> school<00:02:04.880> in

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
good enough for me there's a school in

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.460 
good enough for me there's a school in
Michigan<00:02:05.180> that<00:02:05.810> has<00:02:05.930> adopted<00:02:06.170> this

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
Michigan that has adopted this

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:07.840 
Michigan that has adopted this
instructional<00:02:07.009> model<00:02:07.250> for<00:02:07.369> all<00:02:07.549> of<00:02:07.729> their

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
instructional model for all of their

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:09.820 
instructional model for all of their
core<00:02:08.030> classes<00:02:08.300> what<00:02:09.080> they're<00:02:09.259> seeing<00:02:09.560> there

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
core classes what they're seeing there

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.460 
core classes what they're seeing there
is<00:02:10.069> that<00:02:10.640> their<00:02:11.600> failure<00:02:12.080> rates<00:02:12.290> have<00:02:12.440> gone

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
is that their failure rates have gone

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.259 
is that their failure rates have gone
from<00:02:12.739> like<00:02:12.890> in<00:02:13.040> the<00:02:13.130> 40<00:02:13.400> percents<00:02:13.849> down<00:02:14.060> to

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
from like in the 40 percents down to

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:16.120 
from like in the 40 percents down to
single<00:02:14.569> digits<00:02:14.720> so<00:02:15.410> this<00:02:15.680> is<00:02:15.830> that's<00:02:15.950> pretty

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
single digits so this is that's pretty

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.610 
single digits so this is that's pretty
remarkable<00:02:16.459> there<00:02:17.170> one<00:02:18.170> of<00:02:18.200> the<00:02:18.290> concerns

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
remarkable there one of the concerns

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:19.960 
remarkable there one of the concerns
that<00:02:18.739> educators<00:02:19.190> are<00:02:19.370> really<00:02:19.400> wrestling<00:02:19.940> with

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
that educators are really wrestling with

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.729 
that educators are really wrestling with
these<00:02:20.209> days<00:02:20.450> is<00:02:20.750> the<00:02:20.989> fact<00:02:21.230> that<00:02:21.319> we<00:02:21.530> are

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
these days is the fact that we are

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:24.070 
these days is the fact that we are
preparing<00:02:22.280> our<00:02:22.489> students<00:02:22.940> for<00:02:23.239> jobs<00:02:23.930> that

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
preparing our students for jobs that

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.259 
preparing our students for jobs that
don't<00:02:24.200> exist<00:02:24.650> yet<00:02:24.980> and<00:02:25.220> I<00:02:25.610> really<00:02:25.819> see<00:02:25.970> flipped

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
don't exist yet and I really see flipped

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:27.820 
don't exist yet and I really see flipped
learning<00:02:26.420> is<00:02:26.750> a<00:02:26.810> tool<00:02:27.230> that<00:02:27.260> teachers<00:02:27.709> can

a meaningful way so I might not be
