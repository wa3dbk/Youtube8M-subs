00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
using by an inch long and this is a

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:57.380 
using by an inch long and this is a
concept<00:00:54.899> I<00:00:55.079> was<00:00:55.199> using<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.559> get<00:00:55.770> beam<00:00:56.390> straight

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
concept I was using to get beam straight

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.529 
concept I was using to get beam straight
plumbed<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.879> centered<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.059> everything

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
plumbed and centered and everything

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.380 
plumbed and centered and everything
according<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.680> barrel<00:01:02.160> lid<00:01:02.370> again<00:01:03.149> I

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
according to the barrel lid again I

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.020 
according to the barrel lid again I
wonder<00:01:03.780> if<00:01:03.899> an<00:01:04.019> inline<00:01:04.559> with<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.030> exhaust

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
wonder if an inline with the exhaust

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.240 
wonder if an inline with the exhaust
pipe<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:07.110> be<00:01:07.229> coming<00:01:07.530> out<00:01:07.680> so<00:01:07.950> this<00:01:08.010> is<00:01:08.189> a

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
pipe that be coming out so this is a

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.340 
pipe that be coming out so this is a
process<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:08.700> use<00:01:08.939> process<00:01:09.659> I<00:01:09.810> use<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.229> get

several<00:02:17.150> coats<00:02:17.360> on<00:02:17.630> it<00:02:17.810> finished<00:02:18.140> up<00:02:18.260> with

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
several coats on it finished up with

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.070 
several coats on it finished up with
another<00:02:18.650> slurry<00:02:19.390> ceramic<00:02:20.390> dip<00:02:20.600> at<00:02:20.750> the<00:02:20.870> end

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
another slurry ceramic dip at the end

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.100 
another slurry ceramic dip at the end
and<00:02:21.740> before<00:02:22.400> all<00:02:22.760> the<00:02:22.940> comments<00:02:23.600> do<00:02:23.750> start<00:02:24.020> if

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
and before all the comments do start if

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.680 
and before all the comments do start if
they<00:02:24.230> do<00:02:24.290> I<00:02:24.590> do<00:02:25.250> realize<00:02:25.760> this<00:02:25.970> is<00:02:26.180> ceramic<00:02:26.390> on

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
they do I do realize this is ceramic on

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.690 
they do I do realize this is ceramic on
steel<00:02:26.960> the<00:02:27.170> stew<00:02:27.350> is<00:02:27.380> going<00:02:27.800> to<00:02:27.890> expand<00:02:28.370> which

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
steel the stew is going to expand which

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.540 
steel the stew is going to expand which
will<00:02:28.850> possibly<00:02:29.240> crack<00:02:29.750> the<00:02:30.620> ceramic<00:02:31.280> on<00:02:31.400> there

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
will possibly crack the ceramic on there

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.130 
will possibly crack the ceramic on there
and<00:02:31.640> I<00:02:31.670> do<00:02:31.730> anticipate<00:02:32.090> that<00:02:32.450> happening<00:02:32.660> so

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
and I do anticipate that happening so

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.130 
and I do anticipate that happening so
what<00:02:33.770> I'm<00:02:33.860> going<00:02:34.040> to<00:02:34.070> be<00:02:34.160> doing<00:02:34.520> probably<00:02:34.790> next

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
what I'm going to be doing probably next

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.590 
what I'm going to be doing probably next

piece of glass fiber or fiberglass cloth
I<00:02:52.130> also<00:02:52.430> dipped<00:02:52.640> it<00:02:52.790> in<00:02:52.880> the<00:02:53.000> slurry<00:02:53.240> also<00:02:53.780> this

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:54.320 
I also dipped it in the slurry also this

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.170 
I also dipped it in the slurry also this
is<00:02:54.500> kind<00:02:54.620> of<00:02:54.710> a<00:02:54.800> test<00:02:55.040> procedures<00:02:55.490> usually

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
is kind of a test procedures usually

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.060 
is kind of a test procedures usually
these<00:02:56.270> routes<00:02:56.540> I<00:02:56.720> want<00:02:56.900> to<00:02:56.990> go<00:02:57.110> with<00:02:57.290> but<00:02:57.920> what

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
these routes I want to go with but what

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.000 
these routes I want to go with but what
I'll<00:02:58.220> do<00:02:58.460> is<00:02:58.610> I<00:02:58.640> will<00:02:58.840> wrap<00:02:59.840> the<00:03:00.410> combustion

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
I'll do is I will wrap the combustion

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.930 
I'll do is I will wrap the combustion
chamber<00:03:01.490> in<00:03:01.670> the<00:03:01.940> K<00:03:02.570> wall<00:03:02.870> and<00:03:03.170> either<00:03:04.130> coat<00:03:04.730> it

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
chamber in the K wall and either coat it

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.350 
chamber in the K wall and either coat it
with<00:03:05.660> the<00:03:05.780> ceramic<00:03:06.050> slurry<00:03:06.350> or<00:03:06.740> acro<00:03:07.670> coat<00:03:08.180> the

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
with the ceramic slurry or acro coat the

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.660 
with the ceramic slurry or acro coat the
glass<00:03:08.840> mat<00:03:09.230> and<00:03:09.500> then<00:03:09.620> apply<00:03:09.950> it<00:03:10.010> on<00:03:10.250> top<00:03:10.520> of

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
glass mat and then apply it on top of

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.150 
glass mat and then apply it on top of
the<00:03:10.760> cable<00:03:11.110> that<00:03:12.110> be<00:03:12.260> the<00:03:12.320> next<00:03:12.620> step<00:03:12.800> after<00:03:12.980> I

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
the cable that be the next step after I

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.330 
the cable that be the next step after I
see<00:03:13.850> how<00:03:13.880> the<00:03:13.970> burn<00:03:14.240> test<00:03:14.510> goes<00:03:14.870> on<00:03:15.170> the<00:03:15.410> J<00:03:16.100> tube

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
see how the burn test goes on the J tube

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.340 
see how the burn test goes on the J tube
with<00:03:16.610> just<00:03:16.850> a<00:03:16.970> ceramic<00:03:17.450> on<00:03:17.660> top<00:03:17.900> of<00:03:17.990> the<00:03:18.050> metal

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
with just a ceramic on top of the metal

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.130 
with just a ceramic on top of the metal
and<00:03:18.470> as<00:03:18.620> again<00:03:18.830> I<00:03:18.890> do<00:03:19.070> anticipate<00:03:19.460> that<00:03:20.140> really

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
and as again I do anticipate that really

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.990 
and as again I do anticipate that really
heating<00:03:21.830> up<00:03:21.890> is<00:03:22.070> paying<00:03:22.280> a<00:03:22.490> cracking<00:03:22.880> or

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
heating up is paying a cracking or

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.740 
heating up is paying a cracking or
ceramic<00:03:23.510> off<00:03:23.690> on<00:03:23.900> that<00:03:24.190> so<00:03:25.300> that's<00:03:26.300> about<00:03:26.450> it

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
ceramic off on that so that's about it

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.770 
ceramic off on that so that's about it
