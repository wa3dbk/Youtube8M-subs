 Hello everyone, Andrei and today we are 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.120
 starting to play minecraft 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:14.309
 and so i created the world the world now we will 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:16.600
 survive in this cubic space 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.840
 1 napero what we need to do it 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:23.310
 put all of us who are just not 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:26.020
 and from here therefore let's deal with it. 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.660
 first you will need a place or remote control 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.640
 be so factory in here are mine 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.040
 actions decided to listen to the whole build 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.550
 tree house 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.949
 so now take care of this 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:43.120
 foliage 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:47.470
 No, and Moroi any supplies of the note 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:49.150
 not for its construction such mined 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:52.380
 supplies for building a house and 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:55.890
 discovered such a thing is a new tree 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.890
 but air 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.540
 here 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.260
 and so I think this amount of earth stones 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.260
 will pay 

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:18.610
 so now we can 5 build a house well to 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:21.280
 in the evening I finished my labors and otgrohal 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:25.920
 such a decent mansion which is made 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:33.970
 from stone to earth and wood here I have 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:36.819
 the furniture already has a second floor 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:39.610
 then you can doctor say so 

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:44.700
 that it will be possible to grow wheat and plant 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.700
 trees with this let's do that very conveniently 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:54.610
 saw on expired narva nod at there 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.910
 have bags 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.910
 my 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:02.460
 photo about twitter 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.049
 but 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:13.230
 I died and lost where my house is 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:18.340
 so I run a spider in those times 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:21.100
 Well, it came to this typical moment 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.720
 it was interesting to finish with you 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.410
