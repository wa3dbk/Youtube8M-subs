00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:08.179
 beautiful new next generation world beautiful 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.830
 new full hd world from because of 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:12.620
 while most ps play four games 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:15.309
 actually provides 1080p resolution 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.150
 in the xbox one camp outrage wide 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:18.949
 Numerous titles run on the 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.739
 Microsoft console only in diminished 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:22.789
 Resolution 1080p is not the same 

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:25.429
 1080p 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:27.380
 because the xbox gives up her image signal 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:29.809
 always wish in full hd one 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.579
 tv continues to calculate but just 

00:00:29.809 --> 00:00:32.230
 some play more badly than right 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:34.820
 high 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.250
 the native resolution of each 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.620
 game is actually changed is often 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.390
 much lower based on the 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.770
 famous watergate affair speak many 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.100
 in this connection even from 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.750
 resolution money the list of games the 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.600
 on the ps4 technically high quality 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:54.620
 that's why Assassin's creed 4 is long gone 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:58.280
 on the ps4 since the patch in 1080p 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:02.300
 The Xbox were only in 900 p battlefield 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:06.259
 4 on the ps4 in 900 p on the xbox one 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:10.819
 only 720 p call of duty on the 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:13.850
 ps4 in 1080p on xbox one only in 27 

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:18.319
 p metal gear solid ground zero on the 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:22.549
 ps4 in 1080p on xbox one only in 27 

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:25.939
 p deep on the ps4 in 1080p on the xbox 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:28.609
 one only in 900 p and tomb raider on the 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:32.929
 ps4 in 1080p and with 60 images per 

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:34.569
 second on the xbox one also 1080p but 

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:36.770
 just with 30 frames 

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:38.420
 but why is it that even exclusive 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.969
 title like titan folk one 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.469
 create full hd resolution as a reason for 

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:44.209
 these differences differ from many developers 

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:44.749
 the hardware architecture of microsoft 

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:47.630
 console 

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:50.810
 because during gddr5 memory 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.909
 the ps4 data with up to 176 gigabit pro 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.520
 second processed the ram creates the 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.209
 xbox of only about 68 gigabits per 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.159
 second 

00:01:56.209 --> 00:02:00.859
 this bandwidth is simply enough 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.609
 not around 60 pictures per second in 1080p 

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:04.549
 to render 

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:06.200
 now comes the big but microsoft 

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:08.660
 used his console additionally 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.160
 so-called embedded esra around the 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.930
 to release the brake 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.690
 the high-speed memory is only 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.660
 32 mb big what many developers currently 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.490
 apparently overwhelmed by this rather 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.320
 you have to understand technical problem 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.700
 dive deep into the matter 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.220
 Let's take the example 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.810
 Battlefield 4 represents the dice shooter 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.090
 his chic look through t shirt 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.040
 rendering as every picture is made up 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.810
 Four so-called borders together 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.240
 the individual pixels get like that 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.770
 successively depth information color 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.630
 alignment and lighting 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.700
 Each of the four countries must be day 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:44.030
 Mandatory a color depth of at least 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:46.370
 32 bits each have 8 bits for the colors red 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.230
 green and blue as well as eight for the 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.710
 alpha channel of the transparency values 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.830
 purports 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:57.350
 the rest is naked mathematics four 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:03:02.000
 passages times 32 bit x 1920 x 1080 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:04.160
 pixel yields 31 64 megabytes already 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.620
 It would be the frame of the xbox one always 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.400
 completely occupied but just like that 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.080
 sufficient 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.000
 unfortunately, the graphics unit is also stupid 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.000
 the microsoft console slower than that 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.950
 ps4 porto and for 1080p with 60 frames 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.740
 must the data exchange between ram 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.700
 building blocks and gpu always perfect and 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.250
 run fast 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.840
 Need for speed series runs just like 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.510
 Battlefield 4 with the frostbite engine 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.940
 and comes on the xbox were even 1080p 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.570
 but therefore only with 30 images per 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.240
 second 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:34.190
 For comparison the edges of the day of the sony 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:37.280
 shooters killzone shadow are full 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.750
 fabulous 800 megawatts of the ps4 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.870
 seems so clearly in the current here 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:43.670
 to be still beneficial to the microsoft 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.020
 promises by firmware update the 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.820
 management and programming of the 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.680
 memory for developers 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.570
 we can be curious when this is the 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.000
 case will be future titles 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.920
 like hot dogs or thunderstorms three 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.590
 according to many sources on the xbox ago with 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.120
 run a reduced resolution, 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:02.470
 So we will probably still have resolution gate 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.470
 to occupy a whole while
