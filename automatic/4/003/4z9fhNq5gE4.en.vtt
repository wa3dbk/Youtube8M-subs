so<00:02:11.970> I'm<00:02:12.060> fairly<00:02:12.300> impressed<00:02:12.780> with<00:02:12.989> it<00:02:13.110> I<00:02:13.200> also

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
so I'm fairly impressed with it I also

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:13.780 
so I'm fairly impressed with it I also
like

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
like

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.630 
like
you<00:02:13.909> silver<00:02:14.870> trim<00:02:15.530> around<00:02:15.739> the<00:02:15.980> gauge<00:02:16.250> or<00:02:16.579> the

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
you silver trim around the gauge or the

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.640 
you silver trim around the gauge or the
knot<00:02:17.599> engages<00:02:18.079> the<00:02:18.290> events<00:02:18.980> and<00:02:20.439> other<00:02:21.439> than

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
knot engages the events and other than

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.009 
knot engages the events and other than
that<00:02:21.909> not<00:02:22.909> a<00:02:22.939> whole<00:02:23.090> lot<00:02:23.269> that's<00:02:23.390> changed<00:02:23.540> in

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
that not a whole lot that's changed in

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:26.470 
that not a whole lot that's changed in
this<00:02:24.219> the<00:02:25.219> armrest<00:02:25.670> does<00:02:25.849> feel<00:02:26.090> a<00:02:26.120> little<00:02:26.209> more

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
this the armrest does feel a little more

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.420 
this the armrest does feel a little more
padded<00:02:26.840> as<00:02:27.019> well<00:02:27.230> so<00:02:27.650> that<00:02:27.799> was<00:02:27.920> another<00:02:28.189> nice

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
padded as well so that was another nice

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.929 
padded as well so that was another nice
touch

00:02:28.929 --> 00:02:28.939 
touch

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:30.970 
touch
overall<00:02:29.540> some<00:02:29.989> nice<00:02:30.170> changes<00:02:30.620> they<00:02:30.739> made

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
overall some nice changes they made

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.679 
overall some nice changes they made
could<00:02:31.790> have<00:02:31.879> been<00:02:31.970> a<00:02:32.000> little<00:02:32.150> more<00:02:32.420> extensive

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:32.689 
could have been a little more extensive

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:37.119 
could have been a little more extensive
maybe<00:02:33.109> but<00:02:33.459> overall<00:02:34.810> it's<00:02:35.810> pretty<00:02:36.260> acceptable

00:02:37.119 --> 00:02:37.129 
maybe but overall it's pretty acceptable

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:42.489 
maybe but overall it's pretty acceptable
interior<00:02:37.760> now<00:02:37.939> so<00:02:38.750> that's<00:02:39.019> the<00:02:39.260> 2012<00:02:40.189> Camaro
