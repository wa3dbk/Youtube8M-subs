00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:06.839
 three years of development for a citroën 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:10.349
 c3 totally new totally new it 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:13.259
 join a car that comes to complete 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:16.619
 our range today in the segment of a 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:19.070
 self that is technological innovator and 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.630
 creative with a spectacular design 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.070
 embodies all values ​​that place 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.560
 has as a brand no no in our 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.300
 positioning of free technology and 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.369
 without a doubt good here in a frame 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.500
 spectacular presenting it to the press 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.180
 because obviously the 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.210
 marketing it without place 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.300
 it's going to be an event and we believe that 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.920
 will be the benchmark of your segment if 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.260
 we started with the exterior design what 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.829
 We see front and reminds us to 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.320
 DS3 if the silhouette is a silhouette 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:51.539
 really innovative seductive modern 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.480
 Robust dynamics is a practical car 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.610
 versatile a new platform with what 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.739
 which wins 10 centimeters in length 4 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.449
 centimeters wide which gives it a 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.300
 really impressive habitability 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.750
 as you say all the front has 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.630
 reminiscences of ds3 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.240
 Boomerang type optics also give you 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:14.120
 a very very sophisticated way at 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.180
 led daytime lights give it an appearance 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:19.340
 sporty and aggressive 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.729
 really really a design that 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.040
 break a bit with the known in this 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.750
 segment particularly I remarked of 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.330
 this car two aspects do not place 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.970
 drive on one side with a quantity of 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.619
 equipment that has evolved 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.119
 with respect to its predecessor as the 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.580
 assisted electrical management that is a 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.560
 new generation the new engines that 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.740
 the vehicle is equipped as three of 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.420
 90 and 115 horses that really have 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.060
 incredible agility in acceleration 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.530
 and gear changes in the new 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.570
 platform a new set of 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.479
 suspension a new brake system 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.640
 with abs really novelties that make 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.619
 of the product at the time of driving what 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.600
 that is really very nice the new 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:02.149
 c3 has a significant index of 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.190
 regional components if you have a 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:06.890
 76 percent regional integration 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.810
 which really is very positive 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.580
 because it speaks clearly of the development 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.900
 of providers that follow 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.300
 working in the region both in 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.850
 Argentina as in Brazil is obviously 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.410
 optimizes also what the cost of 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.780
 vehicle production and allows 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.450
 finally as a benefit for the 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.340
 customer in the market arrive with a 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.770
 product price ratio really 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:31.970
 very very striking for everything that the 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:34.340
 technology equipment auto try 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.950
 of design since we are talking about 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.530
 indexes is also a car that we 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.390
 can be called very important ecological 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.820
 for these times that run ' 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.980
 totally andres because the car is 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:48.620
 constituted with 34 kilos of material 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.140
 green is a 12 is the most product 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:53.660
 ecological manufacturing psa in the region 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.090
 previously it was the c3 aircross with 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.160
 22 kilos of green material has a 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.770
 recyclability index of 90 per 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.200
 hundred and has also covered 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.240
 ecological technology for a minor 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.090
 rolling resistance energy saver 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:10.790
 is the technical name and that improves 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.330
 both the consumption and a lower emission 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.330
 of co2
