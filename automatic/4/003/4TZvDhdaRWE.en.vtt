the HP Envy 32 inch quad HD monitor just

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:28.979 
the HP Envy 32 inch quad HD monitor just
got<00:00:26.259> this<00:00:26.410> from<00:00:26.619> Amazon<00:00:27.359> so<00:00:28.359> far<00:00:28.599> I've<00:00:28.779> taken

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:28.989 
got this from Amazon so far I've taken

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:33.090 
got this from Amazon so far I've taken
out<00:00:29.230> the<00:00:29.439> stand<00:00:29.710> and<00:00:30.609> the<00:00:31.390> power<00:00:31.570> cables<00:00:32.100> back

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
out the stand and the power cables back

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.889 
out the stand and the power cables back
looks<00:00:33.540> fairly<00:00:34.540> large<00:00:36.360> looks<00:00:37.360> like<00:00:37.540> it<00:00:37.690> comes

00:00:37.889 --> 00:00:37.899 
looks fairly large looks like it comes

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:41.149 
looks fairly large looks like it comes
with<00:00:38.170> a<00:00:38.699> display<00:00:39.699> port<00:00:40.089> cable<00:00:40.510> which<00:00:40.659> is<00:00:40.690> great

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:41.159 
with a display port cable which is great

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:43.380 
with a display port cable which is great
because<00:00:42.159> in<00:00:42.370> order<00:00:42.489> to<00:00:42.610> get<00:00:42.790> that<00:00:42.909> quad<00:00:43.180> HD

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
because in order to get that quad HD

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.590 
because in order to get that quad HD
resolution<00:00:44.820> you<00:00:45.820> need<00:00:45.970> a<00:00:46.030> cable<00:00:46.269> like<00:00:46.570> this

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
resolution you need a cable like this

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.540 
resolution you need a cable like this
and<00:00:47.079> your<00:00:47.320> video<00:00:47.530> card<00:00:47.769> needs<00:00:47.979> to<00:00:48.100> support

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.550 
and your video card needs to support

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.609 
and your video card needs to support
that<00:00:49.510> resolution<00:00:52.140> looks<00:00:53.140> like<00:00:53.259> this<00:00:53.439> is<00:00:53.589> a

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:53.619 
that resolution looks like this is a

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:57.979 
that resolution looks like this is a
remote<00:00:54.100> that<00:00:54.900> came<00:00:55.900> with<00:00:56.080> it<00:00:56.199> as<00:00:56.290> well<00:00:56.500> from<00:00:56.949> HP

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
laptop that has a max resolution of 1440

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.109 
laptop that has a max resolution of 1440
which<00:02:03.280> this<00:02:03.490> monitor<00:02:04.390> is<00:02:04.510> a<00:02:04.540> 1440p<00:02:05.320> monitor<00:02:06.119> it

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 
which this monitor is a 1440p monitor it

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:10.800 
which this monitor is a 1440p monitor it
does<00:02:07.330> have<00:02:07.630> a<00:02:08.250> matte<00:02:09.250> finish<00:02:09.489> you<00:02:10.450> can<00:02:10.599> still

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
does have a matte finish you can still

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.300 
does have a matte finish you can still
kind<00:02:10.989> of<00:02:11.110> see<00:02:11.170> the<00:02:11.379> pixels<00:02:11.739> but<00:02:11.890> I<00:02:11.950> mean<00:02:12.159> it's

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
kind of see the pixels but I mean it's

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:18.479 
kind of see the pixels but I mean it's
pretty<00:02:12.459> clear<00:02:14.010> overall<00:02:15.010> the<00:02:15.220> controls<00:02:17.489> are

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
pretty clear overall the controls are

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.000 
pretty clear overall the controls are
not<00:02:19.360> that<00:02:19.510> easy<00:02:19.720> to<00:02:19.900> use<00:02:20.170> there's<00:02:20.409> a<00:02:20.470> turn<00:02:20.769> dial

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
not that easy to use there's a turn dial

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.440 
not that easy to use there's a turn dial
which<00:02:21.430> isn't<00:02:21.700> at<00:02:21.760> the<00:02:21.819> bottom<00:02:22.090> of<00:02:22.209> this<00:02:22.299> right

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
which isn't at the bottom of this right

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:23.640 
which isn't at the bottom of this right
here<00:02:22.689> I<00:02:22.720> don't<00:02:22.810> know<00:02:22.930> if<00:02:22.989> you<00:02:23.110> can<00:02:23.260> see<00:02:23.439> that

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
here I don't know if you can see that

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.649 
here I don't know if you can see that
turned<00:02:23.890> out<00:02:24.069> right<00:02:24.250> there<00:02:24.459> that's<00:02:25.299> for<00:02:25.540> the

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:25.659 
turned out right there that's for the

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:27.989 
turned out right there that's for the
volume<00:02:26.019> I<00:02:26.109> guess<00:02:26.290> when<00:02:27.129> you<00:02:27.249> touch<00:02:27.489> it<00:02:27.519> you<00:02:27.849> get

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:27.999 
volume I guess when you touch it you get

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:30.239 
volume I guess when you touch it you get
this<00:02:28.150> volume<00:02:28.620> symbol<00:02:29.620> up<00:02:29.680> here<00:02:29.709> we<00:02:29.950> can<00:02:30.069> turn

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:30.249 
this volume symbol up here we can turn

00:02:30.249 --> 00:02:31.059 
this volume symbol up here we can turn
them<00:02:30.400> up<00:02:30.639> and<00:02:30.819> down

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
them up and down

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.229 
them up and down
there<00:02:31.249> are<00:02:31.310> a<00:02:31.549> few<00:02:32.209> buttons<00:02:32.420> right<00:02:32.719> here<00:02:34.239> which

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
there are a few buttons right here which

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:39.119 
there are a few buttons right here which
I<00:02:35.389> guess<00:02:35.420> are<00:02:35.840> for<00:02:36.079> setting<00:02:37.069> the<00:02:37.510> picture

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:39.129 
I guess are for setting the picture

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:41.679 
I guess are for setting the picture
settings<00:02:40.129> there's<00:02:40.400> like<00:02:40.579> a<00:02:40.819> few<00:02:41.239> settings<00:02:41.450> you

00:02:41.679 --> 00:02:41.689 
settings there's like a few settings you

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:44.410 
settings there's like a few settings you
can<00:02:41.810> do<00:02:42.549> you<00:02:43.549> can<00:02:43.700> control<00:02:43.939> the<00:02:44.030> bite<00:02:44.209> in<00:02:44.329> this

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
can do you can control the bite in this

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.030 
can do you can control the bite in this
contrast<00:02:44.959> I<00:02:45.170> know<00:02:45.260> I<00:02:45.379> still<00:02:45.530> got<00:02:45.650> to<00:02:45.799> play<00:02:45.920> with
