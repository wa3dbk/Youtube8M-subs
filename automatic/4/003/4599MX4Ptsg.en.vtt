and I want to edit the content I could
change<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:16.880> whole<00:02:16.910> code<00:02:17.210> around<00:02:17.510> and<00:02:17.840> at<00:02:18.290> the

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
change the whole code around and at the

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.810 
change the whole code around and at the
point<00:02:18.590> to<00:02:18.800> something<00:02:19.010> completely<00:02:19.610> different

point to something completely different

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.020 
point to something completely different
than<00:02:20.030> a<00:02:20.210> tray<00:02:20.390> code<00:02:20.660> but<00:02:21.470> for<00:02:21.680> now<00:02:21.710> I<00:02:22.100> just<00:02:22.190> want

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
than a tray code but for now I just want

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.960 
than a tray code but for now I just want
to<00:02:23.120> edit<00:02:23.240> some<00:02:23.480> text<00:02:23.870> and<00:02:23.960> that's<00:02:24.170> it<00:02:24.940> so<00:02:25.940> I

to edit some text and that's it so I

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.240 
to edit some text and that's it so I
change<00:02:26.270> the<00:02:26.360> text<00:02:27.430> hit<00:02:28.430> save<00:02:28.730> and<00:02:30.130> here<00:02:31.130> are<00:02:31.220> my

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
change the text hit save and here are my

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.460 
change the text hit save and here are my
changes<00:02:31.760> which<00:02:32.210> are<00:02:32.330> now<00:02:32.480> also<00:02:32.720> visible<00:02:33.170> to
