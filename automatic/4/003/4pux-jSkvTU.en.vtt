and<00:02:43.620> you<00:02:43.680> really<00:02:43.799> don't<00:02:43.950> want<00:02:44.130> to<00:02:44.160> deal<00:02:44.310> with

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
and you really don't want to deal with

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.979 
and you really don't want to deal with
them<00:02:44.549> hop<00:02:44.730> on<00:02:44.880> a<00:02:44.910> driving<00:02:45.180> then<00:02:45.450> just<00:02:45.600> use<00:02:45.810> them

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
them hop on a driving then just use them

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.020 
them hop on a driving then just use them
to<00:02:46.019> take<00:02:46.230> care<00:02:46.440> of<00:02:46.530> them<00:02:46.650> they<00:02:46.920> pretty<00:02:47.819> much

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
to take care of them they pretty much

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.190 
to take care of them they pretty much
kill<00:02:48.480> everything<00:02:50.390> so<00:02:51.390> yeah<00:02:51.540> that<00:02:51.720> takes<00:02:51.930> care

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
kill everything so yeah that takes care

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.800

of<00:02:52.260> that<00:02:54.920> you<00:02:55.920> can't<00:02:56.220> travel<00:02:56.580> to<00:02:56.850> cities<00:02:57.390> with

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
of that you can't travel to cities with

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.170 
of that you can't travel to cities with
them<00:02:58.049> for<00:02:58.350> obvious<00:02:58.769> reasons<00:02:59.180> considering

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
them for obvious reasons considering

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.759 
them for obvious reasons considering
that<00:03:00.330> when<00:03:00.930> you're<00:03:01.049> in<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.290> city<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:01.680> only

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
that when you're in the city the only

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.710 
that when you're in the city the only
thing<00:03:01.980> that's<00:03:02.160> rendering<00:03:02.700> is<00:03:02.970> the<00:03:03.209> city<00:03:03.450> they

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
thing that's rendering is the city they

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.840 
thing that's rendering is the city they
have<00:03:03.900> really<00:03:04.290> low-level<00:03:04.560> renders<00:03:05.310> outside<00:03:05.730> of

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:05.850 
have really low-level renders outside of

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:07.130 
have really low-level renders outside of
the<00:03:05.910> city<00:03:06.090> just<00:03:06.269> to<00:03:06.390> give<00:03:06.570> you<00:03:06.660> the<00:03:06.780> landscape

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
the city just to give you the landscape

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:10.729 
the city just to give you the landscape
idea<00:03:07.650> if<00:03:07.769> you're<00:03:07.920> at<00:03:08.010> higher<00:03:09.560> elevations<00:03:10.560> in

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
idea if you're at higher elevations in

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:12.710 
idea if you're at higher elevations in
the<00:03:10.769> city<00:03:11.040> so<00:03:11.310> you<00:03:11.880> can't<00:03:12.120> actually<00:03:12.269> go<00:03:12.570> to<00:03:12.630> a

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
the city so you can't actually go to a

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.810 
the city so you can't actually go to a
city<00:03:12.989> because<00:03:13.350> it's<00:03:13.799> pretty<00:03:14.310> hard<00:03:14.519> for<00:03:14.760> the

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
city because it's pretty hard for the

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.789 
city because it's pretty hard for the
dragon<00:03:15.180> to<00:03:15.359> fly<00:03:15.750> just<00:03:16.260> within<00:03:16.500> the<00:03:16.769> city

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
I was looking around trying to think if

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.080 
I was looking around trying to think if
I<00:03:28.350> could<00:03:28.530> you<00:03:28.980> know<00:03:29.100> find<00:03:29.340> one<00:03:29.579> that<00:03:29.790> had

enemies and what I ended up doing was

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.979 
enemies and what I ended up doing was
just<00:03:32.459> randomly<00:03:32.790> fast<00:03:33.390> traveling<00:03:33.840> to

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
just randomly fast traveling to
