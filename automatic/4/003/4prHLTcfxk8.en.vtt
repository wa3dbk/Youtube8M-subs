had<00:02:53.190> to<00:02:53.280> work<00:02:53.430> probably<00:02:54.269> a<00:02:54.299> little<00:02:54.390> harder

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
had to work probably a little harder

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.300 
had to work probably a little harder
than<00:02:54.840> she<00:02:54.870> had<00:02:55.140> to<00:02:55.290> in<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:55.470> first<00:02:55.620> half<00:02:55.860> that's

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
than she had to in the first half that's

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.220 
than she had to in the first half that's
good<00:02:56.549> like<00:02:56.910> Joe<00:02:57.090> Ellis<00:02:57.360> was<00:02:57.510> here<00:02:57.540> because<00:02:58.049> she

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
good like Joe Ellis was here because she

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.780 
good like Joe Ellis was here because she
got<00:02:58.350> to<00:02:58.500> see<00:02:58.680> what<00:02:58.860> I<00:02:58.890> see<00:02:59.130> every<00:02:59.160> single<00:02:59.670> day

house<00:03:03.600> I<00:03:04.040> think<00:03:05.040> that<00:03:05.489> before<00:03:05.700> that

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
house I think that before that

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.819 
house I think that before that
performance<00:03:06.600> there<00:03:06.840> there'll<00:03:07.410> be<00:03:07.440> enough

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 
performance there there'll be enough

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:09.979 
performance there there'll be enough
saves<00:03:08.519> in<00:03:08.760> their<00:03:08.880> performance<00:03:09.420> that<00:03:09.870> would

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
saves in their performance that would
