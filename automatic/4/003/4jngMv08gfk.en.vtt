00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.350
 guys before you start the video vi 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:20.230
 advice to download written periscope 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:22.720
 periscopes is an application you can do 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.060
 I'm juve enough so we'll do it 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.820
 lively but not the clash of france but 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.040
 of real life as we are outside 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.779
 so here you will never see barns serving 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.480
 the twitter account then five minutes 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:34.989
 you can make the twitter account there 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.970
 connected 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:38.590
 Hello everyone back to the guys well 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.050
 channel playing clash of plants i 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.969
 I 'm not at all and today we're going to talk about 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.039
 how to level up like fast 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:48.370
 maybe our most avid fans have 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:50.170
 noted this is a re upload of a 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.239
 our old video that just at 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.410
 same title and we saw that there is a 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.140
 bit of confusion 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.660
 the advice I give you is to strengthen 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:02.769
 even apparently useless things 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:04.360
 like anti-aircraft bombs like those 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:08.950
 long esperien and red and black for 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:11.050
 understand why this because maybe not 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.560
 you do not even have the chance to 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:16.900
 accumulating so much gold is the thing 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.820
 better to carry it forward 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.690
 obviously this purpose and to go up by 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.060
 level 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.520
 my advice is to bring it all up 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.650
 to down to the same level and increase 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.570
 gradually your buildings and not 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:33.330
 speak reader to launch beyond 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:36.550
 of people outside the wax at 10 e 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.770
 another to the 7 what it is that does not lead 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.910
 experience as one could 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.890
 might think 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.010
 you have present laboratory serves for 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.590
 strengthen the sources 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:49.580
 well when you upgrade your troops you don't 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.810
 but he knows why this is a fact 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.870
 then what is it that does not bring experience 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:57.500
 donate troops to the clan's castle 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:59.840
 in war but then in the troops of 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.550
 war by giving them you cannot receive 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.630
 experience this is something that second 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:09.170
 me spilled should change and how 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.060
 in normal multiplayer those who donate receive 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.410
 experience of course because to brute 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.340
 give without receiving anything in return 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.170
 even if you turn off often you do it for 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.690
 help some fellow though something 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.810
 back one always wants it and then what it is 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:27.170
 which does not bring much potential experience 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:30.620
 the walls obviously already cost thousands 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:33.530
 of millions of gold and then one of course 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:37.100
 does not receive the experience this is one of the 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:39.500
 flash dilemmas that the super does not know 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.300
 it makes us answer that it will be everything 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.950
 guys I hope I was a little more 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.170
 clear compared to the old video for whom 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.290
 had seen him because he had not seen 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.910
 let it be the new a greeting and ramat e ci 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.260
 therefore we hear in the comments 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.080
