00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:16.440
 the first crop will be upside down 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:47.760
 and I'm going to poke here ribs have done 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:52.410
 a little point of the talk a lot and 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.790
 that you get this now I'm going 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.590
 to make a little fantasy 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.510
 that is, I close a double sting 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.030
 I will put myself on the place of a 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.630
 fabric and stitched parallel to my 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.630
 first sting 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.560
 like I always start with a 

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:10.560
 fox and I will end up with a channel 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:23.120
 but now I'm going to go back 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:26.570
 body that my pocket well crush the 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:30.890
 top culture now we go 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:34.400
 work the sides first by folding to 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:37.940
 1 cm as we left at the start 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:41.960
 once to bend them kind because I 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:43.810
 will repeat the operation here here here and 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.920
 right here 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:51.050
 then against 1.5 cm small tips 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:02:00.619
 I take my rule and I make a point to 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:02:01.540
 2 cm here like 2 cm the trace all hard 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.550
 ap 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.040
 I will repeat my operation here 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.600
 here and here 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.160
 why I made you draw 2 cm 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:14.209
 because we will take the edge of the fabric 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:18.230
 and come and put it on the sort is like 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:19.130
 that we have our withdrawal to 1 cm there I 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.600
 work with my finger 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.110
 I'm starting to prepare it for long or 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.450
 two ways 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.450
 here and I would like after the meal it's 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:36.230
 so I start scattered here 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:38.030
 now I'm going to fold the la and then 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.470
 there after having drawn well especially 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:44.630
 put the op 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:50.030
 I come for sure but I work 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:52.660
 as I do the same here so 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.989
 here I am very careful to bend 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.989
 correctly removed me 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:11.090
 and here I do it so much for more 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:15.610
 facility is it you want you can 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.610
 to build before ironing 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:24.520
 so for the building I start by year 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.570
 being careful that always 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:35.020
 the edge of my pocket of mine of course 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.020
 sorting 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:49.640
 and I repeat the operation since the other 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.640
 side of the pocket 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.790
 now that I have built I will be able 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.790
 iron 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.900
 you can of course there is the place 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.160
 I have my pocket 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:11.250
 now that I have finished my pocket I 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:15.930
 go class and on points where 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:19.850
 I had done at the beginning so I started 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.850
 to be one of the all angles 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.830
 andrew in lamballe and now the 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.830
 bottom corners 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:49.060
 so I finish pinning by the last 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.060
 angle like this
