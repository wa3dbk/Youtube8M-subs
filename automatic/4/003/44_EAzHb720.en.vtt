template<00:03:29.030> and<00:03:29.560> the<00:03:30.560> computer<00:03:31.010> now

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
template and the computer now

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.820 
template and the computer now
understands<00:03:32.330> what<00:03:32.810> it<00:03:32.930> has<00:03:33.080> to<00:03:33.230> cut<00:03:33.440> and<00:03:33.770> it

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
understands what it has to cut and it

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:38.860 
understands what it has to cut and it
has<00:03:34.040> it<00:03:34.220> right<00:03:34.370> down<00:03:34.580> the<00:03:34.760> scale<00:03:35.030> great<00:03:37.870> now

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
has it right down the scale great now

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.770 
has it right down the scale great now
this<00:03:39.080> looks<00:03:39.380> like<00:03:39.470> your<00:03:39.770> melding<00:03:40.780> low-tech

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
this looks like your melding low-tech

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.660 
this looks like your melding low-tech
and<00:03:41.810> high-tech<00:03:41.990> I<00:03:42.500> mean<00:03:42.680> these<00:03:42.890> other<00:03:43.130> angles

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
and high-tech I mean these other angles

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.010 
and high-tech I mean these other angles
got<00:03:43.790> nothing<00:03:44.150> but<00:03:44.270> a<00:03:44.300> bunch<00:03:44.510> of<00:03:44.600> little<00:03:44.750> wheels

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:45.020 
got nothing but a bunch of little wheels

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.570 
got nothing but a bunch of little wheels
on<00:03:45.260> little<00:03:45.590> rollers<00:03:45.920> that<00:03:46.100> just<00:03:46.280> makes<00:03:46.490> it

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:46.580 
on little rollers that just makes it

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:48.910 
on little rollers that just makes it
very<00:03:46.670> easy<00:03:46.880> to<00:03:47.330> slide<00:03:47.600> the<00:03:47.810> piece<00:03:48.020> of<00:03:48.200> okay<00:03:48.680> and

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 
very easy to slide the piece of okay and

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.290 
very easy to slide the piece of okay and
then<00:03:49.100> once<00:03:49.340> you're<00:03:49.490> done<00:03:49.520> with<00:03:49.670> this<00:03:50.000> well

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.300 
then once you're done with this well

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.190 
then once you're done with this well
remove<00:03:50.810> its<00:03:51.320> history<00:03:51.680> and<00:03:52.070> it's<00:03:52.750> it's<00:03:53.750> all

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
remove its history and it's it's all

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.420 
remove its history and it's it's all
removed<00:03:54.650> and<00:03:54.830> now<00:03:55.160> the<00:03:55.220> the<00:03:57.010> island<00:03:58.010> piece

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
removed and now the the island piece

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.120 
removed and now the the island piece
it's<00:03:59.390> being<00:03:59.630> set<00:04:00.110> now<00:04:00.380> I<00:04:00.410> guess<00:04:00.710> what<00:04:01.010> you've

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
it's being set now I guess what you've

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:02.620 
it's being set now I guess what you've
got<00:04:01.310> here<00:04:01.490> is<00:04:01.550> all<00:04:01.850> these<00:04:02.060> hoses<00:04:02.330> are

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
got here is all these hoses are

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.200 
got here is all these hoses are

delivering air compressed compressed air
that's<00:04:05.480> glue<00:04:05.870> they<00:04:06.080> allowing<00:04:06.320> the<00:04:06.560> slats<00:04:06.800> of

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
that's glue they allowing the slats of

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.370 
that's glue they allowing the slats of
float<00:04:07.450> so<00:04:08.450> that<00:04:08.600> is<00:04:08.690> floating<00:04:09.080> on<00:04:09.170> a<00:04:09.200> cushion

float so that is floating on a cushion

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.370 
float so that is floating on a cushion
of<00:04:09.620> air<00:04:09.800> in<00:04:10.040> here<00:04:10.310> so<00:04:11.180> this<00:04:11.360> setup<00:04:12.110> can<00:04:12.290> be

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
of air in here so this setup can be

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.560 
of air in here so this setup can be
customized<00:04:12.920> to<00:04:13.070> any<00:04:13.220> shape<00:04:13.610> any<00:04:14.030> shape<00:04:14.420> any

design<00:04:15.020> in<00:04:15.200> this<00:04:15.320> particular<00:04:15.620> case<00:04:15.980> we're

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
design in this particular case we're

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.910 
design in this particular case we're
gonna<00:04:16.220> do<00:04:16.430> a<00:04:16.460> knocking<00:04:16.970> yeah<00:04:17.680> looking<00:04:18.680> at<00:04:18.799> the

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:18.920 
gonna do a knocking yeah looking at the

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.920 
gonna do a knocking yeah looking at the
piece<00:04:19.100> on<00:04:19.250> the<00:04:19.280> reverse<00:04:19.640> right<00:04:20.150> because<00:04:20.810> of

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
piece on the reverse right because of

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.530 
piece on the reverse right because of
polish<00:04:21.380> you<00:04:21.530> want<00:04:21.739> the<00:04:22.000> vacuum<00:04:23.000> to<00:04:23.180> hold<00:04:23.420> the

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 
polish you want the vacuum to hold the

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.000 
polish you want the vacuum to hold the
Polish<00:04:23.900> and<00:04:24.050> hold<00:04:24.260> that<00:04:24.380> in<00:04:24.500> place<00:04:24.620> so<00:04:24.860> there's

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
Polish and hold that in place so there's

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:37.420 
Polish and hold that in place so there's
no<00:04:25.130> movement<00:04:25.370> once<00:04:26.060> the<00:04:26.210> milling<00:04:26.600> gets<00:04:26.810> done

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.140 

the<00:04:37.639> machine<00:04:38.000> now<00:04:38.120> is<00:04:38.300> all<00:04:38.449> pre-programmed<00:04:40.150> so

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
the machine now is all pre-programmed so

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.000 
the machine now is all pre-programmed so
the<00:04:41.630> first<00:04:41.870> position<00:04:42.080> is<00:04:42.500> humility

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
the first position is humility

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.580 
the first position is humility
right<00:04:43.610> it<00:04:44.000> will<00:04:44.150> now<00:04:44.330> stop<00:04:44.690> this<00:04:44.930> it<00:04:45.290> took<00:04:45.440> the

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
right it will now stop this it took the

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.920 
right it will now stop this it took the
mill<00:04:45.770> blade<00:04:46.010> and<00:04:46.460> oil<00:04:47.300> position<00:04:47.750> itself<00:04:48.050> to

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
mill blade and oil position itself to

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.920 
mill blade and oil position itself to
begin<00:04:50.930> to<00:04:51.080> the<00:04:51.590> point<00:04:52.150> where<00:04:53.150> we<00:04:53.360> saw<00:04:53.630> at<00:04:53.810> the

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
begin to the point where we saw at the

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.960 
begin to the point where we saw at the
house<00:04:54.110> of<00:04:54.350> columns<00:04:54.830> right<00:04:55.310> so<00:04:55.729> there's

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
house of columns right so there's

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:57.640 
house of columns right so there's
different<00:04:56.150> cutting<00:04:56.630> heads<00:04:56.930> involved<00:04:57.440> and<00:04:57.560> it

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
different cutting heads involved and it

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.680 
different cutting heads involved and it
just<00:04:57.860> changes<00:04:58.310> them<00:04:58.520> tonight<00:04:59.030> so<00:04:59.300> not<00:04:59.660> a

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
just changes them tonight so not a

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.400 
just changes them tonight so not a
pulley<00:05:00.410> all<00:05:00.590> invent<00:05:00.889> automated<00:05:02.229> so<00:05:03.229> it's

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
pulley all invent automated so it's

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:04.689 
pulley all invent automated so it's
fully<00:05:03.620> automated<00:05:04.100> but<00:05:04.340> it's<00:05:04.490> still<00:05:04.639> a

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:04.699 
fully automated but it's still a

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:07.180 
fully automated but it's still a
relatively<00:05:05.210> slow<00:05:05.479> process<00:05:06.169> isn't<00:05:06.410> it<00:05:06.590> Evan<00:05:06.889> it

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
relatively slow process isn't it Evan it

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:08.830 
relatively slow process isn't it Evan it
is<00:05:07.340> Bob<00:05:07.580> it's<00:05:07.820> a<00:05:08.210> it<00:05:08.360> is<00:05:08.479> a<00:05:08.510> slow<00:05:08.780> process

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
is Bob it's a it is a slow process

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.100 
is Bob it's a it is a slow process
but<00:05:09.440> it's<00:05:09.590> a<00:05:09.650> very<00:05:10.039> precise<00:05:10.490> machine<00:05:11.080> with<00:05:12.080> a

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
but it's a very precise machine with a

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:14.409 
but it's a very precise machine with a
beautiful<00:05:12.500> part<00:05:12.710> about<00:05:12.919> this<00:05:13.100> is<00:05:13.340> that<00:05:13.490> I<00:05:13.789> mean

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:14.419 
beautiful part about this is that I mean

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:16.659 
beautiful part about this is that I mean
a<00:05:14.690> CNC<00:05:15.380> machine<00:05:15.500> could<00:05:15.860> produce<00:05:16.010> to<00:05:16.370> the<00:05:16.400> three

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:16.669 
a CNC machine could produce to the three

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:18.400 
a CNC machine could produce to the three
kitchens<00:05:16.880> a<00:05:17.180> day<00:05:17.360> for<00:05:17.630> you<00:05:17.750> on<00:05:17.900> the<00:05:17.960> 12-hour

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.410 
kitchens a day for you on the 12-hour

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.430 
kitchens a day for you on the 12-hour
basis<00:05:18.979> and<00:05:19.760> so<00:05:20.479> even<00:05:20.780> though<00:05:20.900> the<00:05:21.050> guys<00:05:21.199> are

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 
basis and so even though the guys are

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:22.930 
basis and so even though the guys are
taking<00:05:21.770> their<00:05:21.860> lunch<00:05:22.070> break<00:05:22.310> the<00:05:22.490> machine<00:05:22.789> is

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
taking their lunch break the machine is

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:24.640 
taking their lunch break the machine is
still<00:05:23.120> working<00:05:23.360> absolutely<00:05:23.660> correct<00:05:24.410> that's

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
still working absolutely correct that's

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.279 
still working absolutely correct that's
what's<00:05:24.860> nice<00:05:25.039> about<00:05:25.070> it<00:05:25.580> it<00:05:25.760> doesn't<00:05:26.449> give<00:05:27.139> you

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:27.289 
what's nice about it it doesn't give you

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:30.189 
what's nice about it it doesn't give you
it<00:05:27.620> works<00:05:28.039> and<00:05:28.699> it<00:05:28.820> works<00:05:28.970> very<00:05:29.270> precise<00:05:29.720> and

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:30.199 
it works and it works very precise and

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:32.860 
it works and it works very precise and
it<00:05:30.620> just<00:05:30.830> goes<00:05:31.190> on<00:05:31.430> with<00:05:31.760> all<00:05:31.910> the<00:05:32.060> bits<00:05:32.270> the

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
it just goes on with all the bits the

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:34.469 
it just goes on with all the bits the
proper<00:05:33.110> positions

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:34.479 
proper positions

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:37.240 
proper positions
but<00:05:34.599> this<00:05:34.779> properly

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.250 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.370

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:39.380 
well having its equipment like this it

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.400 
well having its equipment like this it
really<00:05:39.530> makes<00:05:39.950> this<00:05:40.480> an<00:05:41.480> easy<00:05:41.660> job<00:05:42.080> even

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:42.410 
really makes this an easy job even

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:45.000 
really makes this an easy job even
though<00:05:42.590> it's<00:05:42.740> a<00:05:42.830> very<00:05:42.860> complicated<00:05:43.550> design

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.010 
though it's a very complicated design
