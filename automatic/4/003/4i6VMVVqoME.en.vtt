 Hey, everyone, beauty, all right. 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.410
 Just kidding with another video 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.509
 This time I'm going to teach you how to 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.809
 duplicate any car choose the 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.279
 michael's house and let it go let's go 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.060
 Back home, maicon. 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.060

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.020
 arriving here in case the maikon does not 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.670

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.850
 who guarantees this only serves if it is in the 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.940

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:46.350

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:50.730
 his lawyer had hit the car in the 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:53.330
 half way and leave way that in the 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.330
 account 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:01:00.470
 You will change characters and at the same time 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.970
 safe time you will hold the oy 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.570
 triangle but then the thing has left the 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.970
 car 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:10.470
 You just switched characters with funk. 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.380

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:22.340

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:22.340
 Let's see, let's wait for the chain. 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.430
 a fight here 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:35.470

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:40.030
 I'm back more mature and ready to go back 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:42.490
 I'm going back to the good sea and come on. 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:47.290
 wait 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:48.729
 away from mission characters far away in 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:02:00.539
 career is characterized in other 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:02:05.140
 places of the eddie character and look there 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:07.899

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:11.100
 front did not go out here into another car 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:11.100
