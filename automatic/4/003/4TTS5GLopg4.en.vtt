00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:14.240
 hello first let's make a debate 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:18.450
 let's discuss if it's worth it 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:20.220
 buy a pc before a console and 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.980
 well inside the video I will leave my 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.349
 opinion I will show you a little the 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.480
 graphic quality what is the 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:28.820
 online platforms communication and 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.560
 the rest 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.450
 and good about everything we want is 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.790
 let your comments know 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.430
 what do you think because you think it's better 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.040
 the console or if you are already playing the pc 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:42.410
 because you like the pc more and more and 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.480
 good in the video because we're going to 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.100
 go see everything so nothing about everything 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.320
 that you participate, that you leave yours 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.320
 comments and we go there 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:56.149
 Well, while we are watching the 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:59.030
 modern warfare gameplay 3 or veis 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:01.159
 quite well the game has nothing 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.109
 special is simply a game of 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:07.100
 background for good that you see also the 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:08.690
 game quality to the maximum of 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.290
 settings 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:15.620
 and well let's start with a little what 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:18.260
 that is going to be the debate I want me to 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:21.170
 leave your comments of what 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:25.400
 you think and so on and well the subject goes 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:29.240
 focused on whether it's worth having 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:32.600
 a powerful pc to enjoy the 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.310
 games I first say yes but 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.180
 well let's go see advantages and 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.180
 inconveniences and others 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:44.650
 about everything you want to win 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:48.520
 containing a high performance PC 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:51.470
 is that the quality of the games improves 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.990
 brutally that is to say they have nothing that 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.720
 watch with consoles but good 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.080
 let's go into more details or more than anything 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.530
 because to begin with if we want a 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.299
 decent computer for games that 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:08.119
 last ones that have left and others 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:09.660
 we would need a pc of about 400 450 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.660
 euros 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.790
 being something basic and with what good 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.510
 we can play quite aaa games 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.680
 maximum quality 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:22.710
 then good is already an inconvenience 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.170
 regarding the console 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.720
 we have also 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.150
 the comfort in the consoles that 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.040
 we directly connect it and we do not have 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.890
 that set absolutely nothing 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.230
 we put the game and I started then always 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.510
 they have to be adjusting the quality 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.810
 graphic and so on the resolution for 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:45.420
 adjust what to what is our 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.610
 Our specifications of our 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.730
 computer 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:54.300
 in that case we can lose something of 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.730
 time but it makes up for it with the 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.480
 quality that can show us the 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.710
 game 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:06.040
 then we have also 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:08.050
 online platforms I started mostly 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.140
 I stay with sting we have also in 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:13.330
 origin and has even taken out ubisoft 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.580
 also its platform but good is 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:18.760
 simply to buy to buy 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.890
 the latter with which it does not deserve much 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:25.330
 I'm sorry for this one and more than anything 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:27.370
 because it is the best not because if it does not have 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.880
 the most games that you 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.650
 can you imagine all the prices 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.710
 they also have the free to play ones 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:38.430
 you have absolutely any game that 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:40.409
 you can search 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.359
 that we do not have in steam post for example 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:45.319
 exclusivities of a like fifa to 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:48.439
 battlefield and others 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:52.760
 prices of the games I can assure you 

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:56.180
 which is team number one platform in 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:59.150
 prices of games since it is putting you 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.129
 offers midweek and end of 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.349
 week we can find for example 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:06.010
 this last time has been the offer of 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:08.439
 cristos then 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.599
 80 percent of what it cost 

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:13.090
 so good is an advantage over 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:14.530
 consoles because we spend a lot less 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.570
 can be checked and adapted enough 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.829
 less than what you can spend on a 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:22.610
 console game even second-hand 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:26.719
 then that is an advantage 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:29.599
 we also have communications in 

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:33.540
 teams 300 we have the xbox live and in 

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:36.720
 place 3 we have the ps network 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:39.510
 I started we have infinities for now it's 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:42.150
 say it's not a problem we have 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:45.630
 from even the platform steel origin 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:47.970
 he also has his a communication chat 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.460
 and so on, that is, it does not imply any 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.740
 disadvantage in front of console 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.900
 so it's not a disadvantage 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.490
 about comforting him is what is the 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.340
 theme of some games that you have to 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:01.560
 play with keyboard and mouse there are people who 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:04.440
 do not want to play with keyboard and mouse with 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:07.110
 which is already ruled out on the pc 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:09.990
 we want to play with keyboard and mouse 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:12.480
 Well, there's no problem then there's 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:17.000
 other games that you can play with command 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:19.370
 even with the xbox 360 controller 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.920
 with which we are playing almost the same 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:26.360
 that in console 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:28.850
 we have to talk about good 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.910
 the comfort that there is of a console 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:33.850
 better not to be in front of a monitor 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:36.560
 continuously and that you can play from 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:39.440
 the distance of a sofa and others 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:42.400
 I started also we can do it with yes 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:46.120
 we connect the monitor 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:48.310
 that we have is from hdmi or even by vga 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.470
 many of you admit it and we can 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:53.500
 play even with the wireless controller 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:57.520
 without any problems 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:06:01.270
 and well basically that's it too 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:04.330
 have to say that for example the 3d fifa 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:07.240
 that will come out in console will cost 70 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:10.150
 euros against the 40 that will cost 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:12.580
 I started and I started even won because that 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:14.200
 the graphic quality since in the online 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:17.460
 well there may be something less than people 

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:21.030
 well postures that there are enough people 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:22.169
 then it is a subject to be debated I want that 

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:26.430
 leave me as I said at the beginning 

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:30.479
 your comments very important that 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:33.560
 participate and good to see what you think 

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:36.720
 since we always climb 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:38.190
 videogame gameplays to the maximum if 

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.590
 you want us to do some of 

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:42.319
 concrete now we can do it from a 

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:44.669
 game that you want to see the most I started 

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:46.800
 to see the difference regarding 

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:49.160
 console because you also say it in the 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:52.570
 comments and others 

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.570
 and nothing I hope you liked 

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:59.530
 the gameplay of modern warfare 3 os 

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:59.530
 we will bring more gameplays as I said 

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:04.380
 so nothing until the next 

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:07.360
 Caracas
