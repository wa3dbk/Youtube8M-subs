00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:11.750
 Czech gate from where the regal 

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:13.580
 own idea came too long 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.400
 not yet lit up 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:19.400
 and that's how hard it is to say 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.980
 here now took in the presence of bent it 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.620
 a fixture maybe two minutes 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:28.220
 minutes here we can create for them 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:32.329
 it's a fixture somewhere but 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:39.590
 entering there is a straw hole such 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:41.960
 put two holes bend so nothing 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.730
 did not understand slip again will explain 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:48.350
 I'll tell you on the fingers from here 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:51.380
 what cho is inserted where inserted 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.810
 wire look here we started 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:59.030
 change i will show him even demonstrate 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:01:02.329
 making these tricky latches here 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.100
 such an adaptation while Sasha goes there for 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:07.310
 wire 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:10.270
 I will try and see such a pipe 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:13.700
 metal square rectangular 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:19.390
 see how tricky you are here with both 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:25.810
 the two sides of the other side 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:28.250
 after just 3 given about 2 3 such tricky 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.150
 Now Sasha will come to show us 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.150
 why do we need them 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.549
 to the field of the wire, it's just like there 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.100
 layout layout layout and end 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:49.000
 working design we take the time well 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:51.100
 that matter is capable of 1 1 look again 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:59.740
 it is on a simplified catalog then bends 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:02:03.789
 she bends done in help 3 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.289
 millimeter steel insert see 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:07.720
 what we got here is this 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:15.360
 the design turned out makes it 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:17.890
 for everything took the hook bends over here and 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.670
 also from this side also from that 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:24.819
 hand yes here now we turn down everything is ready 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:29.319
 bite off the excess and he is ready to handle 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:31.360
 ready to eat bite yes yes about 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.400
 somewhere a minute is wasted when you do here 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.410
 when here are a few pieces of wire 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.750
 cooked tool cooked 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.730
 somewhere a minute can spend 2 minutes 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.950
 sinking and somehow and and bend it here 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.730
 still stab yourself on three then such 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.430
 form looks 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.799
 You can make this form on this 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.959
 will be uncomfortable pissed that 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:50.769
 whichever angle here 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.900
 turned out 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:03:05.139
 usually didn't get over 90 it's just 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:11.069
 better not yes it is just looking here 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:18.780
 here in this place is correct wrong 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:22.000
 in the wrong direction it is superimposed solid 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:25.389
 That principle will not even bend not 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.459
 convenient to cling will be ugly here 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:31.600
 still bite was so here it is 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:33.069
 this is now very clear again 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.549
 This is what you will show us 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:38.990
 some kind of sorry yes what's the whole cafe 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:41.990
 we have some 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:45.620
 here's a finger cut made it weigh 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:50.630
 the wand did not drop in and two holes 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:53.930
 under the axis and axis are different in diameter that is 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:56.330
 here under this wire one diameter and under 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:04:00.320
 this service but here it is clear that they are different 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:04.910
 diameter clasp one 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:07.130
 diabetes all this axis itself suffer 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.620
 I'm so 44 millimeters out of where 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:12.110
 I think it goes by 4 millimeters 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.420
 all mail and everything was just that is 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.910
 then you have it before you assemble it 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.510
 clothing frets collecting then doing 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.510
 perspective 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.049
 thank
