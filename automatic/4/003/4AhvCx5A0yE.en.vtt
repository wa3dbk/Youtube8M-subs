00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.089
 new books on this channel today goes 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.649
 for the first time an electrical product 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.780
 as far as I remember we had that 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:14.089
 not yet on this channel and indeed 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:17.390
 I want you today the volume tyler 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:18.930
 Imagine remington from the keratin 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.060
 therapy series 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.600
 I have to Christmas last year 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.570
 get paid and have already 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.849
 tried a few months and would like 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.920
 briefly introduce you to the product and 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:36.750
 to play a smaller one 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.399
 First of all, it costs about 30 euros 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.250
 if you are lucky you can do it 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.770
 used to buy something cheaper 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.989
 It is not such a product where the 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.430
 brush so automatically you always turn 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.739
 can be the brush to represent but that 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.020
 only goes by hand by clicking on this 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.870
 button and then you can over there 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.399
 on the handle the brush just turn I have 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.829
 never needed and never 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.660
 Tried it because I find the hair 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.600
 then felt very easily when you get the 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.790
 brush also begins to turn but 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.520
 That's a personal attitude we 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.909
 could see the product here 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.640
 these famous keratin plates are the ones 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:18.270
 so quite smooth to put it exactly 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.600
 this is a ceramic 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:25.259
 The keratin coating is very gentle 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.700
 to the hair and not so the hair 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.619
 Damaged should be like that normally 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.590
 The case is when you are in heat 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:35.430
 the volume Tyler has two 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:39.600
 Heat levels 1 and 2 1 I think enough 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.400
 completely out of two is already very warm 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.200
 so follow it after a while if you can 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.079
 just works longer with the product 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.659
 the head was also here that is then 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.450
 a bit uncomfortable for a short time 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:56.009
 cable earlier so that you can be relative 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.630
 long cables to the products to style 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.399
 So I know about it 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.380
 my old velcro iron that has one 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.570
 you can almost stay there forever 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.030
 styling adjoining room so long is that 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.920
 cable because that is unfortunately not so 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.110
 because cable is just accordingly 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.650
 expensive but it is still enough 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.239
 not now that you have problems 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.370
 now not just socket 23 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.799
 then the meter goes away 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:23.400
 round brush has a diameter of 45 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:26.159
 millimeter so 45 cm especially for it 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.629
 thought that you just not so right 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:30.180
 make curls like a curling iron 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:32.700
 but rather so very soft volume i go 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.079
 Now when I first choose that 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.700
 I had tried product 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:37.230
 just wash my hair i had her 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.049
 filled and thought then because 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.359
 I wanted to go out in the evening I share it 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:43.829
 Now with this brush I need to do this 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:46.500
 say I always have it a bit 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:47.790
 like if the hair so my hair 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.669
 have after washing your hair already 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:53.340
 volume because I have headphones and headphones 

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:55.889
 yes also use a volume shampoo and 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.049
 they are not smooth now but have 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:59.730
 Such a slightly modest look but what I am 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.319
 not now as a part brittle and 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.849
 but hairsticks would draw 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.609
 just that a certain volume 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:07.109
 but the hair is not in it 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:09.150
 perfectly smooth 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:11.159
 well then I have this brush 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:15.239
 used and unfortunately had to determine 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:17.760
 that the brush has no volume in the 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:20.129
 makes sense but it makes you very much 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.590
 very very smooth hair 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:25.349
 they feel totally soft afterwards 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.790
 and maintained and he is still too 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:27.599
 a bit warm so really 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.579
 nice 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:31.229
 but if you mess a bit 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.459
 have volume in there or for the 

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:34.709
 maybe with the hair again 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.989
 that way a bit high in the beginning 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.459
 then that disappears completely 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.129
 through the brush I have no idea 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:44.129
 why but she does not do anything to me 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:47.370
 volumes are supposed to make hair the whole 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:49.370
 lay flat on the head and just a little bit 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.409
 where I would say 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.180
 I really chose very very little 

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:56.370
 I try this bar also such a 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.889
 little to use as a curling iron 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.650
 then got the hair so two or three times more 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:04.620
 kept wrapped twice for a long time 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:08.459
 but there is the problem that 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:10.769
 the hair is incredibly much in the 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.569
 brush caught and matted I know 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:14.879
 not what that is, but I suspect 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:16.180
 that's just a guess that it is 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:18.519
 is that this 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.350
 single section with the tips here 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:23.080
 are mobile and that if you have the 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.620
 then remove hair from the brush again 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.080
 want 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.690
 the same injury comes in the same 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.850
 not fixed here but that's just 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.229
 a rough guess it can of course 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.729
 also be easy that I too much 

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:34.150
 awkward am dealing with such a 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:35.949
 brush 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.960
 but after I really have several 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:40.389
 months I almost believe that 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.639
 it's more like these moving bars 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:44.919
 The durability of the world was now 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:46.780
 but not very long with me 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:48.880
 if I brushed off there once 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.680
 with a brush you actually too 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.630
 almost gone there came ever 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.479
 no high I am the whole 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:57.280
 differently used from my klette 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:58.539
 Iron if I lure with it 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.610
 What you can do if you can 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:02.440
 just as you hold you have her 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.360
 already determines many tutorials in front of me 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:05.620
 see then you can make great lure 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.880
 and keep these curls because of me 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.310
 really worth washing after washing 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:11.320
 purse hold your hair 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.000
 of course, do not wash like that again 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.370
 you look from the beginning but the 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.349
 waves are in it until the end 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.039
 I'll see you in two three days then 

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:20.110
 wash again 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:22.960
 they choose the remington steele 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:25.360
 Do not make my evening so there was 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.190
 I also very disappointed that though we did 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.320
 the waves were pretty good 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:32.919
 But then did not last long 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:34.780
 and then you have one too 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:36.520
 nothing of the product had 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.930
 unfortunately I have to say that I am 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.860
 with the application not at all 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.139
 I am satisfied 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:43.000
 because the hair is very common with me 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:44.680
 I find myself caught in this sausage 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.900
 good that she does not turn 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.419
 Nevertheless, I just do not get along 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:52.360
 so that the hair is shortened 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:53.610
 on the other hand, it offers incredibly smooth 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:57.220
 hair so i can well imagine 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:58.900
 if someone is there so totally brittle 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:00.909
 hair has the devices in all from 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:03.159
 especially in the morning when you are 

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:04.930
 the hair rises from the bed 

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:06.340
 often standing in all directions 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:08.650
 and I can imagine that very well 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:10.599
 that you are tamed so great again 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:12.460
 just go through it quickly 

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:14.740
 are the back works and silky and 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:17.680
 that works really great 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:19.479
 but you should not hope for that 

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:21.580
 the hair somehow in volume 

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:23.770
 but rather the opposite of the 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.700
 case is volume brush is that unfortunately 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:26.950
 unusable 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:28.100
 Now I hope I had liked a lot 

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:29.720
 do not skin you maybe 

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.910
 a few other decision on this 

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:35.170
 I wish you one more channel 

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:35.170
 wonderful day and see you soon
