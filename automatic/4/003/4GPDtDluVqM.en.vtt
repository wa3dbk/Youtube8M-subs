created on my desktop here this pc i was
created<00:00:12.570> for<00:00:12.719> a<00:00:12.780> customer<00:00:13.290> that<00:00:13.500> had<00:00:14.280> the

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
created for a customer that had the

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.129 
created for a customer that had the
requirements<00:00:15.000> of<00:00:15.120> machining<00:00:15.900> three

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
requirements of machining three

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.400 
requirements of machining three
different<00:00:16.440> types<00:00:16.650> of<00:00:16.830> parts<00:00:17.279> with<00:00:18.060> a<00:00:18.420> little

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
different types of parts with a little

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.810 
different types of parts with a little
bit<00:00:19.529> of<00:00:19.590> information<00:00:19.800> that<00:00:20.100> changed<00:00:20.640> but

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
bit of information that changed but

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.429 
bit of information that changed but
mostly<00:00:21.270> it<00:00:21.390> stayed<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.689> same<00:00:21.720> so<00:00:22.199> you<00:00:22.289> could

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
mostly it stayed the same so you could

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.650 
mostly it stayed the same so you could
call<00:00:22.650> it<00:00:22.680> a<00:00:22.830> family<00:00:23.039> of<00:00:23.250> parts<00:00:23.550> if<00:00:23.699> you<00:00:23.820> will<00:00:24.000> in

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
call it a family of parts if you will in

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.480 
call it a family of parts if you will in
this<00:00:24.990> particular<00:00:25.199> example<00:00:25.619> there<00:00:26.460> are

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
this particular example there are

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.580 
this particular example there are
several<00:00:26.760> different<00:00:27.119> pipe<00:00:27.269> sizes<00:00:27.810> that<00:00:28.470> the

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
several different pipe sizes that the

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.620 
several different pipe sizes that the
customer<00:00:29.039> did<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.429> we've<00:00:30.090> given<00:00:30.330> them<00:00:30.480> the

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
customer did and we've given them the

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.209 
customer did and we've given them the
capability<00:00:31.170> of<00:00:31.199> selecting<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.769> pipe<00:00:31.980> size

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
capability of selecting the pipe size

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.190 
capability of selecting the pipe size
and<00:00:32.579> then<00:00:32.910> selecting<00:00:33.420> them<00:00:33.570> of<00:00:33.660> one<00:00:33.870> of<00:00:33.989> three

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
and then selecting them of one of three

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.020 
and then selecting them of one of three
components<00:00:34.800> based<00:00:34.980> on<00:00:35.219> that<00:00:35.340> pipe<00:00:35.520> size<00:00:35.790> in

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
components based on that pipe size in

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.360 
components based on that pipe size in
this<00:00:36.780> case<00:00:36.960> there's<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.260> front<00:00:37.590> plate<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:38.100> back

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
this case there's a front plate a back

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.090 
this case there's a front plate a back
plate<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:39.000> core<00:00:39.239> plate<00:00:39.770> within<00:00:40.770> this

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
plate and a core plate within this

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.119 
plate and a core plate within this
family<00:00:41.700> of<00:00:41.730> parts<00:00:42.270> there's<00:00:42.510> also<00:00:42.660> some

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129 
family of parts there's also some

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:45.260 
family of parts there's also some
configurations<00:00:44.129> here<00:00:44.280> under<00:00:44.579> this<00:00:44.700> schedule

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
configurations here under this schedule

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.139 
configurations here under this schedule
where<00:00:46.110> they<00:00:46.260> change<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.829> bit<00:00:47.190> in<00:00:47.370> overall

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
where they change a bit in overall

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.119 
where they change a bit in overall
length<00:00:48.390> in<00:00:48.719> diameter<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.590> so<00:00:49.770> on<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.039> so

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
length in diameter and so on and so

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.100 
length in diameter and so on and so
forth<00:00:50.219> so<00:00:51.059> you<00:00:51.120> could<00:00:51.270> have<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.420> combination<00:00:52.050> of

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
forth so you could have a combination of

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.950 
forth so you could have a combination of
any<00:00:52.260> one<00:00:52.469> of<00:00:52.500> these<00:00:52.710> three<00:00:53.520> scenarios<00:00:53.940> in<00:00:54.360> this

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
any one of these three scenarios in this

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.389 
any one of these three scenarios in this
case<00:00:55.199> here<00:00:55.410> I'm<00:00:55.530> going<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.770> select<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:56.160> core

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
case here I'm going to select a core

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.779 
case here I'm going to select a core
plate<00:00:56.640> under<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.809> schedule<00:00:58.140> of<00:00:58.260> 80<00:00:58.770> which<00:00:59.609> has

there's also a center diameter which

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.039 
there's also a center diameter which
changes<00:01:25.860> as<00:01:26.040> well<00:01:26.330> I'm<00:01:27.330> going<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.659> change<00:01:27.990> that

specifications these holes are tapped in
a<00:01:34.829> particular<00:01:35.280> order<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.780> in<00:01:36.780> this<00:01:37.350> case<00:01:37.560> here

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
a particular order and in this case here

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.410 
a particular order and in this case here
we've<00:01:37.890> hard-coded<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.579> tool<00:01:38.790> size<00:01:39.060> because

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
we've hard-coded the tool size because

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.450 
we've hard-coded the tool size because
this<00:01:39.600> is<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.810> size<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.170> they<00:01:40.229> always<00:01:40.650> use<00:01:40.890> so

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
this is the size that they always use so

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.399 
this is the size that they always use so
maybe<00:01:42.360> in<00:01:42.540> this<00:01:42.659> case<00:01:42.869> I'm<00:01:43.049> going<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.200> choose<00:01:43.350> a

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
maybe in this case I'm going to choose a

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.310 
maybe in this case I'm going to choose a
one<00:01:43.590> at<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.770> top<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.869> last<00:01:46.049> thing<00:01:46.259> that
