00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:25.620 

I<00:01:24.189> think<00:01:24.820> once<00:01:25.000> you've<00:01:25.119> been<00:01:25.180> on<00:01:25.240> the<00:01:25.450> podium

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
I think once you've been on the podium

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.920 
I think once you've been on the podium
as<00:01:26.200> a<00:01:27.100> state<00:01:27.490> champion<00:01:28.000> four<00:01:28.299> times<00:01:28.630> I<00:01:28.869> think

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
as a state champion four times I think

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.300 
as a state champion four times I think
that's<00:01:29.229> what<00:01:29.380> people<00:01:29.619> tend<00:01:29.799> to<00:01:29.860> measure<00:01:30.040> you

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
that's what people tend to measure you

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.550 
that's what people tend to measure you
by<00:01:30.460> they<00:01:31.119> felt<00:01:31.450> in<00:01:31.900> order<00:01:32.110> for<00:01:32.259> them<00:01:32.350> to<00:01:32.409> be

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
by they felt in order for them to be

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.800 
by they felt in order for them to be
successful<00:01:32.740> they<00:01:33.670> had<00:01:33.820> to<00:01:33.970> stand<00:01:34.390> on<00:01:34.540> another

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
successful they had to stand on another

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.300 
successful they had to stand on another
podium<00:01:35.049> and<00:01:35.350> I<00:01:35.409> think<00:01:35.680> that<00:01:35.799> something<00:01:36.159> is<00:01:36.190> in

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
podium and I think that something is in

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.090 
podium and I think that something is in
the<00:01:36.369> back<00:01:36.549> of<00:01:36.580> your<00:01:36.759> mind<00:01:36.970> when<00:01:37.810> a
