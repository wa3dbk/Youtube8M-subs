00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:06.550
 hello thank you for watching this video my 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:09.550
 name is Álvaro Ávila I am a professor of 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:13.330
 simple guitar course and 

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:15.670
 I wanted to record a video explaining the 10 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.369
 most important mistakes that the 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.080
 beginners as a teacher I see this 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:22.240
 every time a person starts playing 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:25.180
 guitar those who start the first day 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.250
 or those who take their first classes and 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.310
 they are things that are easy to correct 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:33.550
 but I have to explain them each for 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:35.410
 apart then I'm not going to make them such 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.410
 all in the same video but do 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.730
 in two or three videos divide it to for 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.100
 to be able to cover each one of the 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:46.000
 points then let's see the 10 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:50.590
 beginner errors ok error number 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.910
 1 in my course I always teach when 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.160
 a person is starting from zero to 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.019
 only play a string so that it 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.989
 go familiarizing with the guitar if 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:01.390
 You play on six strings of the first day 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.519
 is going to do a crazy thing is going to the person 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.130
 will resign and will say that he can not 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:07.990
 play guitar then we start 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.120
 practicing on a string and what is the 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:14.550
 error I teach you easy melodies 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.550
 how to touch the birthday for example 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:21.280
 something like that and then it turns out that the 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.619
 person what it does is that and it's natural 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.810
 that is, if you do it is fine 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:27.700
 natural is that he touches everything with his finger 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.100
 index because this is the strongest finger 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:33.520
 it's the number one finger then it plays 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.460
 all the notes with that I taught them to 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.200
 play several songs several melodies 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.380
 touching on a single string so that the 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.899
 brain can assimilate the information of 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.179
 what it is to press the force that there is 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:47.890
 what to do the placement the coordination 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:50.409
 with the other hand all on one string 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:54.250
 first that's why my course is designed 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:56.679
 so then it turns out that they start to 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.780
 play all the notes with just one finger and 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:02:00.250
 that's fine let's say at the beginning 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.009
 let's say we 're going to play at the beginning 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.299
 of birthday this is not this is just 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:05.830
 an example so that you understand the 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:08.369
 let's say we're going to touch the 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.369
 birthday 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.190
 i 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:18.629
 touch all the notes with finger 11 and 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:20.459
 That's what the students what happens 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:22.890
 when we play all the notes with the 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.340
 finger 1 that only that finger knows how to touch 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.799
 guitar 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.170
 the other three fingers that we occupy 

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:31.379
 to remove the 2 3 and 4 do not know how to play 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.750
 guitar then you have to train 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:37.829
 the four fingers to play guitar and 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.659
 not just one finger then is 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:42.450
 What I recommend is that if you're 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:44.430
 touching notes what you are practicing 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.650
 I hope it's at first only in a 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.040
 rope then everything and then in three no 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.709
 play all the strings at the same time 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.030
 try if you get tired this finger 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.430
 start using this other so that this one 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.010
 can rest and when you have more 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.470
 confidence will start using finger 3 that 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.500
 is a little weaker and so you are using 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.239
 each one of the exercises 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:09.900
 important that you can practice is 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:11.609
 play with all four fingers but not in the 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.909
 first fret as you teach it in the 

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:16.620
 universities but on the fifth fret 

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:18.840
 because here the 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:22.290
 frets and it's hard to stretch your fingers 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:25.890
 of fret 5 are closer together then 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:28.980
 you can practice with your finger 1 here in 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:34.440
 the fifth fret finger 2 in the sixth 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:37.620
 Fret finger 3 on the seventh fret and 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:40.390
 finger 4 on the eighth fret but I do not know 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.310
 it's worth removing them it has to be one 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.140
 then the other after the other and 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.730
 then the other but when the 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.250
 Little boy, everyone has to be 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.590
 placed in that way 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.350
 you are training your fingers so that 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:56.290
 all learn to play guitar and not 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:58.470
 only the finger ok we go quickly 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.380
 role number 2 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:04.170
 error number 2 is rather with the 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:06.390
 right hand that when we learn 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:10.230
 chords let's say we learn a chord 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:13.110
 easy as my youngest and then when 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:16.340
 we make rhythms they only touch with the finger 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.340
 thumb gums 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:28.890
 and it's fine but it turns out that the nails 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:30.750
 they give a little shine to the strings 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:33.510
 so if we only play the rhythms with 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:36.900
 the thumb yarn are going to have a sound 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:39.390
 darker if we combine the thumb 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.890
 together with the nails then we are going to 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:44.070
 to have 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:47.160
 the sound a little brighter in 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:49.880
 the ropes below would be for example 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.880
 something like this 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.070
 with my thumb I can do as a 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.840
 peyo species 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.840
 but then he continued with the dreams 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.550
 and later 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.580
 instead if I do everything with the thumb I'm going 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:11.610
 to have a more opaque sound that is the 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:14.190
 error number 2 according to my list list 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.630
 that I made at random from the mistakes that I 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:20.470
 it seems that they are more common 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:22.300
 the other mistake too they commit a lot 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:24.730
 the people is with the right hand 

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.040
 also when it comes to making rhythms and 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:27.760
 is that there are two types of people 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.860
 Usually when I'm going to teach 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:33.040
 guitar I find two basic types 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:36.250
 of people who give you hard and 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:38.170
 those who play very softly are those are 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.340
 the main personalities when 

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:41.620
 someone to play guitar is not 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:44.140
 learning then those that give him 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:46.150
 very hard they give to the sixth 

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:48.670
 rope and the fifth because it is the 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:51.100
 first in which contact when 

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:54.250
 they are going to touch they make contact first with 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:58.000
 the sixth and the fifth string then to 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:59.800
 give it so hard and produce an ugly sound 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.010
 in some chords 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:04.990
 for example the network chord is a 

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:08.410
 agree that what we need to sound 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:10.600
 are the thin strings in the 

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:12.940
 first the brightest there where 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:15.550
 we need the chord sound because 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:17.470
 if I play in the thick 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:20.670
 not going to happen hear how it sounds 

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:22.950
 playing on the websites of companies 

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:26.420
 everything sounds the same 

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:28.620
 you do not hear any chord the chord of the b 

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:33.200
 we need to emphasize the strings 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:33.200
 Delicate these bright wings 

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:41.289
 On the other hand, if I play hard in the 

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:43.959
 sixth is not going to listen at all the 

00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:46.679
 chord of the break the same with others 

00:06:43.959 --> 00:06:50.780
 chords then the people who touch 

00:06:46.679 --> 00:06:53.000
 strong that they give hard to the guitar 

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:55.460
 they make contact with the ropes first 

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.870
 from above and they give it so strong that it does not 

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:59.350
 listen to the accordion 

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:02.810
 So what you have to do is try 

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:06.050
 for those people try not to fall with 

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:08.360
 so much strength in the sixth and fifth 

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:12.400
 but rather from the fourth down 

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:12.400
 try that the beat of the rhythm 

00:07:12.729 --> 00:07:16.509
 it is emphasized more on the strings 

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:19.860
 bright because those are what the 

00:07:16.509 --> 00:07:19.860
 end determine the chord 

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:28.380
 On the other hand, if the above is strong 

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:28.380
 you do not know what agreement I'm making 

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:34.580
 that 's fine for the blog about 

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:39.039
 chords that are called power college 

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:39.039
 where if we want to touch on the hardness 

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:47.990
 but for current chords like the 

00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:50.450
 king we need the sound of the strings 

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:54.100
 bright good and in the next video 

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:54.100
 let's see more mistakes
