we're looking at a tweak called icon

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:03.819 
we're looking at a tweak called icon
renamer<00:02:02.359> and<00:02:02.689> it's<00:02:03.079> tweaks<00:02:03.350> like<00:02:03.469> these<00:02:03.649> to

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:03.829 
renamer and it's tweaks like these to

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:05.499 
renamer and it's tweaks like these to
make<00:02:03.979> it<00:02:04.130> really<00:02:04.490> sort<00:02:04.789> of<00:02:04.819> make<00:02:05.090> you<00:02:05.210> realize

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
make it really sort of make you realize

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:07.270 
make it really sort of make you realize
why<00:02:05.539> it's<00:02:05.869> good<00:02:06.020> to<00:02:06.049> have<00:02:06.109> a<00:02:06.200> jailbreak<00:02:06.679> just

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
why it's good to have a jailbreak just

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.340 
why it's good to have a jailbreak just
something<00:02:07.549> so<00:02:07.729> simple<00:02:08.030> but<00:02:08.420> it<00:02:08.720> selves<00:02:09.259> is

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
something so simple but it selves is

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:10.660 
something so simple but it selves is
something<00:02:09.590> you<00:02:09.679> can't<00:02:09.920> do<00:02:10.069> without<00:02:10.340> a<00:02:10.399> jar

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
something you can't do without a jar

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.550 
something you can't do without a jar
break<00:02:10.850> unfortunately<00:02:11.480> so<00:02:11.990> if<00:02:12.140> we<00:02:12.260> just<00:02:12.470> go

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
break unfortunately so if we just go

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.770 
break unfortunately so if we just go
ahead<00:02:12.680> and<00:02:13.069> put<00:02:13.790> our<00:02:13.819> icons<00:02:14.240> in<00:02:14.390> to<00:02:14.510> wiggle

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
ahead and put our icons in to wiggle

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.140 
ahead and put our icons in to wiggle
mode<00:02:14.959> and<00:02:15.230> what<00:02:16.100> we'll<00:02:16.280> do<00:02:16.459> is<00:02:16.580> just<00:02:16.610> clap<00:02:16.970> on

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
mode and what we'll do is just clap on

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.140 
mode and what we'll do is just clap on
this<00:02:18.050> one<00:02:18.230> here<00:02:18.530> and<00:02:18.680> as<00:02:19.460> you<00:02:19.610> can<00:02:19.730> see<00:02:19.790> just

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
this one here and as you can see just

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.390 
this one here and as you can see just
gives<00:02:20.330> you<00:02:20.390> the<00:02:20.510> option<00:02:20.780> to<00:02:20.930> rename<00:02:21.320> the<00:02:22.040> the

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
gives you the option to rename the the

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.950 
gives you the option to rename the the
app<00:02:22.520> itself

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
app itself

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.120 
app itself
so<00:02:23.020> you<00:02:23.110> can<00:02:23.230> see<00:02:23.380> that's<00:02:23.560> what<00:02:23.770> it<00:02:23.800> was<00:02:23.980> called

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
so you can see that's what it was called

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.370 
so you can see that's what it was called
initially<00:02:24.610> I<00:02:24.760> just<00:02:25.690> sort<00:02:25.840> of<00:02:25.870> renamed<00:02:26.230> it<00:02:26.350> to

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
initially I just sort of renamed it to

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.560 
initially I just sort of renamed it to
scores<00:02:26.800> and<00:02:27.490> we<00:02:27.580> can<00:02:27.730> press<00:02:27.880> apply<00:02:28.120> and<00:02:28.240> then

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
scores and we can press apply and then

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.840 
scores and we can press apply and then
that<00:02:28.720> obviously<00:02:28.990> just<00:02:29.230> updates<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:29.890> the<00:02:30.670> name

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
that obviously just updates the the name

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.430 
that obviously just updates the the name

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
think with the options you just close

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.410 
think with the options you just close
the<00:03:29.620> messages<00:03:30.280> app<00:03:30.400> and<00:03:30.550> open<00:03:30.820> it<00:03:30.940> again<00:03:31.150> so

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:34.860 
that's pretty cool and this I think is
