00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:22.140
 hello friends now i want you 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.350
 tell a little about what you need 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.480
 to make a knife blade 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:32.240
 pay attention now we are not worth it 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.240
 the center of the blade is shifted to the left and 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.710
 the distance between the blade of the knife and the liner 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.890
 there practically 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:43.559
 tenths of a millimeter I will now show 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.409
 what you need to do to become a knife 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:50.659
 center so that we also fix it now 

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:50.659
 tight running problem 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:58.409
 blade we'll see what's all there 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.420
 inside how things are and by the way very 

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:05.280
 tight lock axis we walk it a little 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.380
 under fire the spring is not so tight 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.060
 kept the lock very uncomfortable 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.200
 open literally the only two 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.170
 fingers open 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.360
 I'll pause the knife now. 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.960
 I have two types of screwdriver 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:24.119
 torx 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:27.990
 and we will continue dear friends I unscrewed 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:31.369
 Now one of the first overlay want 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:35.340
 draw your attention that the whole knife and 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:42.829
 here in the oil note everything in 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:47.149
 oil is poured just so much right 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:47.149
 pay attention to the manner itself 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:53.400
 on the liner itself pay attention here 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:57.620
 near the oil mechanism right drops and on 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.620
 pad pad too here is all in oil 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.330
 also want to draw your attention that 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:37.260
 bolts 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:39.060
 Without thread lock, see I see 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.740
 Now I take a photo to make it 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.030
 better seen so friends continue 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.920
 I didn't do anything further 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.650
 rubbed wanted to bring your attention to 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:53.280
 What condition does the knife come in? 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.950
 please here is a fluoroplastic washer 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.540
 see how much is not dirt 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.970
 Cook sawdust any metal 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.060
 metal shavings 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:06.840
 she creaked straight when the knife 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:11.550
 laid out see from this side 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:14.370
 also so here comes knives so 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.150
 better even expensive knives that you 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.320
 are buying 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:22.709
 whale or so or in america order 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:24.300
 I recommend to disassemble the whole knives to clean and 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.850
 lubricate yourself look how much 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:29.310
 here is oil despite the fact that oil 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.200
 there was a lot of a knife barely barely barely 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:35.100
 turned that is with one hand very 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:37.260
 tight opened this i wanted you 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:44.510

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:44.510
 wanted bolts here axial screw see 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:59.130
 if there is a thread retainer then its 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:04:00.140
 quite a bit he look so he 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.090
 practically not 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.860
 all screws in oil absolutely all screws 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.170
 all the little cogs they were all in 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:09.290
 oil right now I will choose to plant them on 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.900
 thread lock that while paused again 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:15.350
 I will clean and polish everything 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:18.290
 dear friends continue to refine 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:22.400
 chinese knife ganzo g704 means 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:25.690
 show a little bit due to 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:29.840
 dirt got there the remains of chips and 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:33.590
 Now focus attention 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:37.669
 You see from shaybochki remained such as 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:40.910
 traces in a circle on this side 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:45.200
 scratched blade with this no I mean 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:46.640
 I would polish them I rubbed them now 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:50.570
 good condition 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:55.160
 Means that I still made liners here 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:59.630
 here is where the axis went here is very 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:04.450
 there was a bad metal treatment and this one 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:06.440
 peg he literally clung to 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:09.080
 irregularities liner 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:14.000
 top and bottom ours i'm here and here 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:17.860
 polished pleased with the quality of racing 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.860
 Please see what banks with 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:29.960
 such grooves cans are very neat 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:33.860
 Liked means and on cogs yet 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:38.900
 there is some nastiness now i will try 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:44.000
 show the lock thread to call it 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:48.740
 it is impossible because he is absolutely no way 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:51.620
 kept it just some kind of dirt just 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.250
 some kind of dirt is not this is not a retainer 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:58.430
 this is nonsense 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:06:00.680
 It means that even well, I wiped the oil and pursed 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:03.410
 springs now spring will not be like that 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:06.400
 by others, but now we collect this knife and 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:10.800
 let's see what happens of course I will lubricate 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:13.180
 put on axial sealant 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:15.970
 until pause continue when 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:20.139
 here is a knife but friends finished assembling a knife 

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:24.449
 assembled with axial axial screw both screws i 

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:27.189
 I put these screws on the thread retainer 

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:29.349
 on the lock thread did not plant 

00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:38.229
 I see this need then come on 

00:06:29.349 --> 00:06:40.319
 Now let's see the blade perfectly 

00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:40.319
 center 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:48.729

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:51.759
 no backlash and cross 

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:53.400
 longitudinal knife flies knife folds 

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:55.960

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:58.569
