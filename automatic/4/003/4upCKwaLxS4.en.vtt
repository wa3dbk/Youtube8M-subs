00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.490
 pass this command 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.440

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.200
 During this time 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:58.630
 next year 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.670

 most interesting most massive brawl 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.400
 in connection with the activity 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.400

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.910
 before 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.570
 Well, in the second round 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.100
 research has proven mine 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.910

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.660
 surely 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.140
 I understand that the situation is practically 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.290
 already 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.290
