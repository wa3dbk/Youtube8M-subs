 on our beautiful tuna steak see 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:35.270
 the beauty of fillet is not like that in 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.610
 sachin and is a wonderful veggie but 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.260
 let's give it a little bit of heat to 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.770
 to seal it I put a little bit of 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:45.560
 sesame oil we are going to varnish what 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.860
 the truth is that fresh tuna is a 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:51.650
 wonder has a lot of nutrients 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.440
 Did you know that you have more protein than 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:59.360
 Red meat 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:02.690
 100 grams of fresh tuna has 23 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.500
 grams of protein imagine nothing more and 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:09.110
 apart it is a high quality protein 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.600
 has omega 3 is a blue fish like 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.150
 well we know it the blue fish has 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.220
 these wonderful fatty acids for 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.970
 we other people who want 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:22.790
 lose weight the tuna is the best option 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:26.450
 then we are going to seal it in a pan 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.880
 or in a hot comal without oil not 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.000
 it requires oil because it already varnish masters 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.500
 we'll put a little salt and 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.080
 pepper the other side you have to 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.570
 to feed it well is a neutral fish 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:42.080
 It has a short flavor but nothing more with 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:44.570
 salt and pepper is delicious and 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.600
 I recommend that nothing else seal it for a 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:50.150
 couple of minutes do not cook it all because 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.690
 the truth that rosadito in the center 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.319
 it's delicious then let's take a 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.420

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:08.389
 small grated let's put juice of 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:11.410
 lemon or you can put vinegar on 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:15.070
 Rice vinegar is also going excellent 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:18.070

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:23.200
 bittersweet vinaigrette let's put a 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:25.000
 little bit of sesame oil remembers 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.180
 that sesame oil can 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.940
 find in the eastern area of 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.850
 supermarket then we add sauce 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:36.490
 soy to flavor and we already have a 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.590

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.400
 little gold and nothing else as I say what 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:59.380
 We will seal if to you in house not 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.970

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:09.590
 this fish the truth that is a 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:11.210
 wonder the tuna is special to 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.090
 people who want to lose weight 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:16.850
 because it 's high in protein like 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:19.609
 he commented and they have lots of vitamins and 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.799

 growing children is wonderful and 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:29.900
 the taste as I say it is very rich now 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:33.200
 the fresh steak is a little more expensive 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:35.000
 If you can not buy the client in 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.730
 the week does not matter 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.070
 can you consume a can of tuna in 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:41.840
 water drains it and that puts you 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:43.370
 salad and you will know just as rich 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.770
 but if ever you go to 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:48.920

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:07.830
 color much more iron has and 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:10.840
 it's wonderful for the blood then 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:15.240
 what we are going to do is put 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:18.599
