00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
 hello everyone so I you 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:05.759
 come back in a new video for 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.610
 you do a bit of a battle between two 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.139
 identical products in fact so this will be 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.719
 as you could see in title 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:17.400
 on cleansing oils so there 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:19.890
 sephora and l'oréal so I could 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.080
 test the 2 and suddenly compare them on 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.539
 several points so I told you about it 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.970
 right now so already at the level of 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.970
 packagings the sephora is presented as 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.700
 this so both are transparent 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.710
 you see so I really like the form 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.739
 rounded frankly I find that 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.149
 really very classy and all and for the 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.370
 Lorraine is the same 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.710
 something as classy I like it less 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.450
 orange rather prefers glass like that 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.870
 but after that it's a question of 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.760
 taste so here's for the real hall 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.300
 so it's both bottles 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.289
 pump 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:59.989
 so that's ultra practical so go on 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:03.809
 will start by presenting them to you so 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:05.129
 we will start with sephora oil 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.439
 so every time I talk to you 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.960
 of a point to note I will start with his 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:13.170
 saddle of among these pigs level of those 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:20.189
 from sephora the price is 9 euros 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:23.759
 95 so 9 euros 95 for this bottle ci and 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:27.869
 there our real costs 6 euros 20 so already 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.909
 at the low price level l'oréal wins a 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.810
 since it is cheaper so a point 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:37.920
 for l'oréal then at the level of 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:40.890
 quantities the sephora contains 190 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.659
 milliliters so there are more in 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.930
 this one in the real hall that 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.780
 contains 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.100
 150 militate so there are some 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.430
 milliliters of difference so she did 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.920
 more in the cph will have so I have 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.440
 body of d more my point to sephora 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.540
 because certainly she is a bit more 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.690
 expensive but suddenly there are higher 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.620
 level quantity prize game it comes down to 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.200
 about the same 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.520
 but I find that suddenly I prefer 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.830
 buy a product where there is a little 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.780
 more to avoid buying back the whole 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.910
 time suddenly that of l'oréal seen 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.290
 that it's me it's a little cheaper and 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.320
 which is less than low amount of the neck 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.480
 will have to buy it more often so on 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.310
 this point I grant my point enough 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.100
 strong at this level of the duration of 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.950
 products so the product from sephora 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:30.160
 lasts twelve months is the product of 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.560
 l'oréal hardens months so at the level of 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.920
 durations I still have my point to sephora 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:38.830
 because it still lasts 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.810
 a long time finally I do not use 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.239
 inevitably every day so that's true 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.320
 that lasts long enough so twelve 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:46.780
 month I think it's reasonable 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.980
 for a product against 6 months for 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.230
 the l'oréal 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.760
 I find that a little bit fair he could have 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:56.530
 frankly the m 1 1 1 1 year 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.420
 because frankly that's what it would be 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.410
 the one it's not something what 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.640
 finally there are people who 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.140
 use it every day but me for 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.489
 my part I do not use it all 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:08.350
 days so here's for at the level of the 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.180
 length of time after it's true that the 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:14.980
 least in the so Oréal it is used 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:16.440
 faster but me that it does not know 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.780
 still it is me that I leave and I am 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.700
 not even half and yet the one that 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.720
 suddenly that I use most since 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:26.670
 it lasts less 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:29.040
 so here for that point then at 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.230
 level packaging both 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.080
 frankly its very pretty and practical 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.550
 so there you have a rounded side me I 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.640
 rather prefers to reproduce them before said 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:40.290
 I find it prettier after 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.880
 square packagings it's still 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.550
 quite chic 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.480
 So I also like against by the 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.670
 pump level 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.440
 I prefer this one because it 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:53.220
 is bigger so we can 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:57.470
 better to support but it comes out the same 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:04:00.690
 thereof Hawaii and Lorraine is 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:03.270
 it's a little pump like this but 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.740
 the pumps are really easy practice 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:07.530
 to dose so there is no problem 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.850
 but here I have maybe a little 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.620
 preferably on the sephora but 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.870
 frankly both packagings are 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.790
 very practical and very nice so suddenly 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:18.209
 I'll put a point to them all 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:23.430
 two at the level now of quality 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:25.980
 is made only at site etc of the product so 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:28.410
 I could test them both so 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.960
 quite a long time anyway and 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:34.710
 frankly I prefer the texture of 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.240
 those of sephora home I will you 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.120
 show after I will try to put you a 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.280
 little to insert some swatch at 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.230
 oil level to show you a little 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.470
 the texture but I find that this is 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:47.490
 forlan removes much better 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:50.220
 especially at the eye level you do not have 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.740
 no need to really rubbed a lot 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.030
 what you have to scrub at the level of 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.150
 eyes when you're mascara and everything 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.890
 but I find that that of sephora 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.710
 maquis better than those at l'oréal 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:02.760
 after it is played just a few 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.440
 seconds 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.910
 finally I mean finally must not no 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.569
 plus ten minutes of make-up break 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.369
 with c 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:10.949
 if but I find that at the level of 

00:05:08.369 --> 00:05:13.469
 efficiency there these forums and maquis 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:15.270
 significantly better and faster so 

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:17.639
 I do not want to spend three 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:19.349
 hours make me clean so here is so 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:22.259
 I would give my corner to that of home 

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:25.139
 sephora is also frankly she 

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:27.119
 is worth it if you do not want to put ten 

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:28.709
 euros in a low oil chose me 

00:05:27.119 --> 00:05:30.990
 it's more like l'oréal's because 

00:05:28.709 --> 00:05:32.339
 that the removes also very well but 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.819
 those of sephora is clearly 

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:39.240
 faster than at the level of textures the 

00:05:35.819 --> 00:05:40.589
 l'oréal and a chouille more and more 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.990
 thick that it's strong at it's 

00:05:40.589 --> 00:05:48.059
 maybe that's why she's struggling to 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:51.389
 to stay woman has many maquis and I 

00:05:48.059 --> 00:05:52.919
 finds that in the end she seduced so 

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:53.849
 it's still pretty serious and I 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:54.779
 find that the law is still 

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:56.849
 quite serious 

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:58.110
 I do not have I prefer the high level of 

00:05:56.849 --> 00:06:00.990
 textures I prefer the one from home 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:02.819
 sephora and at the level of odors 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:07.019
 frankly they are both 

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:08.729
 very good lots stay late I could 

00:06:07.019 --> 00:06:11.369
 not describe the smells but they 

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:13.019
 are very good but bape in the same I 

00:06:11.369 --> 00:06:14.419
 prefers the smell of the chains of his 

00:06:13.019 --> 00:06:19.050
 forms 

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:20.879
 yes it feels too much in what way I have 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:23.699
 more pleasure to use this one than 

00:06:20.879 --> 00:06:25.680
 the other one so in fact there sephora ball 

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:26.099
 is in my closet and the one at home 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.959
 L'oréal 

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:30.659
 she is in my shower like that I have 

00:06:27.959 --> 00:06:32.159
 one that I can use when I pass 

00:06:30.659 --> 00:06:33.869
 on the sweet one that I use when I 

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:34.889
 am in the shower like this for example 

00:06:33.869 --> 00:06:36.059
 when I go in the shower and that I 

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:39.659
 I'm not removing makeup I use the 

00:06:36.059 --> 00:06:42.269
 l'oréal so so suddenly for the 

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:43.889
 result of who wins at this low battle 

00:06:42.269 --> 00:06:48.629
 we will do the math 

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:53.879
 so for the l'oréal price for the 

00:06:48.629 --> 00:06:59.819
 quantity sephora for the duration sephora 

00:06:53.879 --> 00:07:02.149
 for packaging both for the 

00:06:59.819 --> 00:07:06.479
 quality and efficiency 

00:07:02.149 --> 00:07:08.650
 sephora and so for the texture sephora 

00:07:06.479 --> 00:07:10.600
 so clearly 

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:12.430
 and that of home sephora that I 

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:15.370
 prefer so I specify that this is my 

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:17.830
 notice me I tested them so I can 

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:20.710
 give my opinion so it's sephora who 

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:23.139
 wins the battle so frankly 

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:25.360
 it is an oil that I love so 

00:07:23.139 --> 00:07:28.090
 frankly super happy to have it 

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:30.699
 bought after those at l'oréal est 

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:31.990
 really good too if you want like 

00:07:30.699 --> 00:07:33.910
 I told you earlier not to put 

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:34.180
 ten euros it suits you very well 

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:37.539
 well 

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:39.430
 but in principle they are practically 

00:07:37.539 --> 00:07:43.090
 the same job I say they are there for 

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:45.580
 remove one so frankly that's it 

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:47.440
 is worth but those at home sephora is 

00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:49.270
 for me a bigger favorite 

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:51.340
 so here I hope that this review you 

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:53.650
 will have helped and we have to comfort to 

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:56.260
 buy one or the other so as I 

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:58.060
 after you've said it's still in 

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.740
 you to make your yvois there 

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:01.030
 I hope you enjoyed this video 

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:03.400
 do not hesitate to tell me in comment 

00:08:01.030 --> 00:08:05.050
 if you have tested one of the two is 

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.160
 which one do you prefer where I 'm doing 

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:10.199
 full of big kisses and I tell him to 

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:10.199
 soon in another video lease
