00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
sometimes the names of the quilts that

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.340 
sometimes the names of the quilts that
we<00:00:56.370> put<00:00:56.550> in<00:00:56.640> change<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.659> little<00:00:57.870> bit<00:00:58.019> here<00:00:58.229> and

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
we put in change a little bit here and

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.689 
we put in change a little bit here and
there<00:00:58.409> because<00:00:58.800> if<00:00:58.949> they're<00:00:59.100> it<00:00:59.519> just

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
there because if they're it just

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.100 
there because if they're it just
recently<00:01:00.000> happened<00:01:00.180> we<00:01:00.449> had<00:01:00.540> a<00:01:00.570> quote<00:01:00.870> that

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
recently happened we had a quote that

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.020 
recently happened we had a quote that
was<00:01:01.409> going<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:01.589> be<00:01:01.680> called<00:01:01.830> topsy-turvy<00:01:02.610> but

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
was going to be called topsy-turvy but

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.310 
was going to be called topsy-turvy but
guess<00:01:03.180> what<00:01:03.390> there<00:01:03.629> was<00:01:03.720> already<00:01:03.900> a<00:01:04.110> quote

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
guess what there was already a quote

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.810 
guess what there was already a quote
called<00:01:04.559> topsy<00:01:04.890> turvy<00:01:04.920> so<00:01:05.220> we<00:01:05.309> needed<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.640> name

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
called topsy turvy so we needed to name

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:06.469 
called topsy turvy so we needed to name
it<00:01:05.940> something<00:01:06.060> else

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
it something else

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.520 
it something else
so<00:01:06.720> sometimes<00:01:07.250> names<00:01:08.250> will<00:01:08.760> be<00:01:09.630> adapted<00:01:09.870> for

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
so sometimes names will be adapted for

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.920 
so sometimes names will be adapted for
things<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.250> also<00:01:11.370> names<00:01:11.760> of<00:01:11.940> blocks<00:01:12.210> really

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
things and also names of blocks really

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.350 
things and also names of blocks really
can<00:01:13.649> be<00:01:14.070> changed<00:01:14.549> sometimes<00:01:15.000> you'll<00:01:15.149> see<00:01:15.329> a

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360

probably not called that but maybe you

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:48.380 
probably not called that but maybe you
never<00:01:46.619> know<00:01:46.799> so<00:01:47.310> we're<00:01:47.789> gonna<00:01:47.880> put<00:01:48.119> this<00:01:48.210> block

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
never know so we're gonna put this block

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.149 
never know so we're gonna put this block
together<00:01:48.719> just<00:01:48.990> I'll<00:01:49.259> show<00:01:49.439> you<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.590> few<00:01:49.799> simple

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
together just I'll show you a few simple

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.249 
together just I'll show you a few simple
things<00:01:50.189> about<00:01:51.119> it<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:51.539> we're<00:01:51.749> also<00:01:51.869> also

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
things about it and we're also also

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.330 
things about it and we're also also
going<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.469> take<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.649> look<00:01:52.829> at<00:01:52.920> what<00:01:53.039> happens

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
going to take a look at what happens

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.800 
going to take a look at what happens
when<00:01:53.490> four<00:01:53.880> of<00:01:54.030> these<00:01:54.119> big<00:01:54.359> blocks<00:01:54.539> go

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
when four of these big blocks go

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.840 
when four of these big blocks go
together<00:01:54.950> there's<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:56.009> very<00:01:56.249> cool<00:01:56.460> little

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
together there's a very cool little

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.840 
together there's a very cool little
bonus<00:01:57.479> thing<00:01:57.780> that<00:01:58.020> happens<00:01:58.350> so<00:01:58.890> first<00:01:59.609> of<00:01:59.729> all

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
bonus thing that happens so first of all

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.370 
bonus thing that happens so first of all
let's<00:02:00.119> take<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.329> look<00:02:00.600> at<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:01.049> different

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
let's take a look at the different

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.800 
let's take a look at the different
quadrants<00:02:02.219> that<00:02:02.490> this<00:02:02.670> block<00:02:02.969> is<00:02:03.210> made<00:02:03.420> up<00:02:03.570> of

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
quadrants that this block is made up of

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.080 
quadrants that this block is made up of
put<00:02:04.499> this<00:02:04.590> over<00:02:04.859> here<00:02:05.130> we<00:02:05.490> have<00:02:05.579> a<00:02:05.609> four<00:02:05.880> patch

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
put this over here we have a four patch

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.350 
put this over here we have a four patch
very<00:02:06.479> very<00:02:06.719> simple<00:02:07.079> on<00:02:07.289> one

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
very very simple on one

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.150 
very very simple on one
the<00:02:08.600> diagonals<00:02:09.140> will<00:02:09.320> move<00:02:09.470> it<00:02:09.560> in<00:02:09.650> here<00:02:10.070> and

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
the diagonals will move it in here and

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.970 
the diagonals will move it in here and
then<00:02:10.550> we<00:02:10.700> have<00:02:10.940> these<00:02:11.240> little<00:02:11.320> well<00:02:12.320> I<00:02:12.590> don't

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
then we have these little well I don't

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.740 
then we have these little well I don't
know<00:02:13.040> they're<00:02:13.190> kind<00:02:13.370> of<00:02:13.400> like<00:02:13.520> flying<00:02:13.910> it's

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
know they're kind of like flying it's

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.680 
know they're kind of like flying it's
like<00:02:14.840> a<00:02:14.930> flying<00:02:15.170> fish<00:02:15.440> we<00:02:15.860> flying<00:02:16.820> fish<00:02:17.060> okay

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
like a flying fish we flying fish okay

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.840 
like a flying fish we flying fish okay
and<00:02:17.990> then<00:02:18.320> the<00:02:18.440> other<00:02:18.590> flying<00:02:18.860> fish<00:02:19.130> comes<00:02:19.610> in

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
and then the other flying fish comes in

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.690 
and then the other flying fish comes in
here<00:02:20.210> is<00:02:20.600> that<00:02:20.720> right<00:02:20.870> no<00:02:21.590> it's<00:02:22.010> not<00:02:22.220> well

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
here is that right no it's not well

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.000 
here is that right no it's not well
that's<00:02:22.790> funny<00:02:23.060> actually<00:02:23.300> because<00:02:23.890> you<00:02:24.890> would

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
that's funny actually because you would

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.800 
that's funny actually because you would
actually<00:02:25.190> start<00:02:25.550> getting<00:02:25.730> different<00:02:26.090> you

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
actually start getting different you

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.060 
actually start getting different you
would<00:02:26.930> get<00:02:27.020> a<00:02:27.050> totally<00:02:27.410> different<00:02:27.440> block<00:02:27.860> I

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
would get a totally different block I

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:29.170 
would get a totally different block I
hope<00:02:28.160> that's<00:02:28.340> not<00:02:28.400> too<00:02:28.580> confusing<00:02:28.760> for<00:02:29.090> you

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
hope that's not too confusing for you

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.180 
hope that's not too confusing for you
but<00:02:29.210> this<00:02:29.480> would<00:02:29.780> be<00:02:29.900> a<00:02:29.930> different<00:02:30.260> block<00:02:30.440> then

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
but this would be a different block then

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.280 
but this would be a different block then
how<00:02:31.730> we<00:02:31.790> actually<00:02:32.060> set<00:02:32.390> it<00:02:32.480> up<00:02:32.570> to<00:02:32.810> see<00:02:32.960> just

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
how we actually set it up to see just

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.470 
how we actually set it up to see just
how<00:02:33.350> you<00:02:33.440> turn<00:02:33.800> the<00:02:34.070> pieces<00:02:34.250> is<00:02:34.760> makes<00:02:35.420> a

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
how you turn the pieces is makes a

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.090 
how you turn the pieces is makes a
difference<00:02:35.750> because<00:02:35.840> now<00:02:36.050> when<00:02:36.770> we<00:02:36.860> do<00:02:36.980> it

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
difference because now when we do it

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.670 
difference because now when we do it
like<00:02:37.190> this<00:02:37.250> and<00:02:37.880> we<00:02:38.630> that<00:02:39.260> would<00:02:39.380> be<00:02:39.470> another

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
like this and we that would be another

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.280 
like this and we that would be another
way<00:02:39.860> to<00:02:39.920> set<00:02:40.250> it<00:02:40.280> up<00:02:40.460> but<00:02:40.880> in<00:02:41.000> fact<00:02:41.180> it's<00:02:42.080> this

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
way to set it up but in fact it's this

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.430 
way to set it up but in fact it's this
guy<00:02:42.470> okay<00:02:42.860> sorry<00:02:43.220> see<00:02:43.550> you<00:02:43.790> get<00:02:43.940> like<00:02:44.210> I<00:02:44.480> could

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
guy okay sorry see you get like I could

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.900 
guy okay sorry see you get like I could
count<00:02:45.620> on<00:02:45.710> like<00:02:45.920> eight<00:02:46.100> different<00:02:46.220> variations

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
count on like eight different variations

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.580 
count on like eight different variations
with<00:02:47.240> just<00:02:47.660> four<00:02:47.810> quadrants<00:02:48.230> something<00:02:48.470> like

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:48.590 
with just four quadrants something like

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.280 
with just four quadrants something like
that<00:02:48.770> it<00:02:49.220> gets<00:02:49.370> exponentially<00:02:49.880> different<00:02:50.840> so

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
that it gets exponentially different so

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.840 
that it gets exponentially different so
um<00:02:51.590> okay<00:02:51.890> so<00:02:51.950> you<00:02:52.130> have<00:02:52.370> these<00:02:52.490> different

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
um okay so you have these different

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.670 
um okay so you have these different
quadrants<00:02:53.660> and<00:02:53.900> this<00:02:54.020> is<00:02:54.140> how<00:02:54.290> they<00:02:54.560> go

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
quadrants and this is how they go

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.980 
quadrants and this is how they go
together<00:02:54.880> we<00:02:55.880> are<00:02:55.910> going<00:02:56.180> to<00:02:56.420> chemin<00:02:56.750> I<00:02:56.840> want

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990 
together we are going to chemin I want

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:58.090 
together we are going to chemin I want
to<00:02:57.080> show<00:02:57.170> you<00:02:57.230> how<00:02:57.410> to<00:02:57.440> do<00:02:57.620> one<00:02:57.770> of<00:02:57.800> these<00:02:57.920> half

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
to show you how to do one of these half

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.910 
to show you how to do one of these half
square<00:02:58.310> triangle<00:02:58.730> units<00:02:59.030> right<00:02:59.300> here<00:02:59.780> we<00:03:00.770> use

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
square triangle units right here we use

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.010 
square triangle units right here we use
a<00:03:00.950> half<00:03:01.340> and<00:03:01.490> quarter<00:03:01.610> ruler<00:03:02.030> a<00:03:02.060> lot<00:03:02.450> and<00:03:02.870> we

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.020 
a half and quarter ruler a lot and we

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.020 
a half and quarter ruler a lot and we
talk<00:03:03.200> about<00:03:03.320> half<00:03:03.620> square<00:03:04.370> triangles<00:03:04.820> a<00:03:04.880> lot

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
talk about half square triangles a lot

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.360 
talk about half square triangles a lot
because<00:03:05.300> they<00:03:05.630> show<00:03:05.780> up<00:03:06.020> a<00:03:06.140> lot<00:03:06.290> so<00:03:06.800> what<00:03:07.340> I

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
because they show up a lot so what I

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.300 
because they show up a lot so what I
want<00:03:07.580> to<00:03:07.670> do<00:03:07.850> and<00:03:08.180> this<00:03:08.330> is<00:03:08.450> a<00:03:08.480> good<00:03:09.310> good

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
want to do and this is a good good

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.070 
want to do and this is a good good
example<00:03:10.760> of<00:03:10.880> the<00:03:11.209> different<00:03:11.480> marking<00:03:11.840> pens

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
example of the different marking pens

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.570 
example of the different marking pens
that<00:03:12.380> you<00:03:12.470> might<00:03:12.620> want<00:03:12.800> to<00:03:12.830> have<00:03:12.980> available

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
that you might want to have available

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.750 
that you might want to have available
I'm<00:03:14.000> gonna<00:03:14.450> show<00:03:14.690> you<00:03:14.950> there's<00:03:15.950> this<00:03:16.220> fabric

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
I'm gonna show you there's this fabric

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.610 
I'm gonna show you there's this fabric
marker<00:03:17.180> okay<00:03:17.900> and<00:03:18.019> that's<00:03:18.170> that's<00:03:18.470> a

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
marker okay and that's that's a

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.740 
marker okay and that's that's a
permanent<00:03:18.890> marker<00:03:19.430> and<00:03:19.640> that's<00:03:19.760> gonna<00:03:19.970> be<00:03:20.239> a

need a lot of one kind of pass per

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:32.640 
need a lot of one kind of pass per
triangle<00:05:31.420> this<00:05:31.570> is<00:05:31.630> a<00:05:31.750> really<00:05:32.140> good<00:05:32.290> way<00:05:32.410> to<00:05:32.470> do

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:06.820 
triangles simple as that great cut off

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:07.980 
triangles simple as that great cut off
your<00:06:06.940> doggers<00:06:07.240> and<00:06:07.510> you're<00:06:07.600> ready<00:06:07.720> to<00:06:07.810> put

your doggers and you're ready to put
together<00:06:08.140> your<00:06:08.350> quadrants<00:06:08.770> okay<00:06:09.070> so<00:06:09.610> then<00:06:10.420> you

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:10.540 
together your quadrants okay so then you

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:14.430 
together your quadrants okay so then you
put<00:06:10.720> your<00:06:10.930> little<00:06:11.050> half<00:06:11.290> square<00:06:11.560> triangle<00:06:13.440> yep

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:14.440 
put your little half square triangle yep

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.190 
put your little half square triangle yep
right<00:06:15.340> there<00:06:15.370> sew<00:06:16.240> it<00:06:16.390> onto<00:06:16.540> your<00:06:16.720> black<00:06:16.930> patch

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:17.200 
right there sew it onto your black patch

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.440 
right there sew it onto your black patch
or<00:06:18.190> whatever<00:06:18.460> colors<00:06:18.700> you're<00:06:18.880> using<00:06:18.910> follow

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:21.360 
or whatever colors you're using follow
your<00:06:19.600> pattern<00:06:19.780> and<00:06:20.110> then<00:06:20.590> you've<00:06:21.070> got<00:06:21.250> these

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:21.370 
your pattern and then you've got these

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:22.890 
your pattern and then you've got these
quadrants<00:06:21.760> going<00:06:22.030> okay<00:06:22.240> so<00:06:22.300> we<00:06:22.480> have<00:06:22.600> one

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:22.900 
quadrants going okay so we have one

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.010 
quadrants going okay so we have one
block<00:06:23.370> these<00:06:24.370> are<00:06:24.490> pretty<00:06:24.640> big<00:06:24.820> blocks<00:06:25.090> maybe

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:26.020 
block these are pretty big blocks maybe

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.630 
block these are pretty big blocks maybe
they're<00:06:26.230> measuring<00:06:26.560> 12<00:06:26.770> inches<00:06:27.070> even<00:06:27.280> and

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:27.640 
they're measuring 12 inches even and

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.870 
they're measuring 12 inches even and
then<00:06:28.360> we<00:06:28.510> have<00:06:28.660> another<00:06:28.930> block<00:06:29.170> I<00:06:29.760> think<00:06:30.760> you

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:30.880 
then we have another block I think you

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.160 
then we have another block I think you
can<00:06:31.030> see<00:06:31.240> what's<00:06:31.450> gonna<00:06:31.570> happen<00:06:31.660> in<00:06:32.050> the

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:32.170 
can see what's gonna happen in the

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:38.100 
can see what's gonna happen in the
center<00:06:33.990> the<00:06:34.990> center<00:06:35.490> can<00:06:36.490> hold<00:06:36.820> and<00:06:37.810> when<00:06:37.990> it

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:38.110 
center the center can hold and when it

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:43.920 
center the center can hold and when it
does<00:06:39.960> it<00:06:40.960> forms<00:06:41.440> an<00:06:42.190> extra<00:06:42.700> star<00:06:42.970> isn't<00:06:43.780> that

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:43.930 
does it forms an extra star isn't that

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:46.500 
does it forms an extra star isn't that
cool<00:06:44.170> so<00:06:45.070> you<00:06:45.550> can<00:06:45.670> just<00:06:45.790> imagine<00:06:45.910> when<00:06:46.420> you

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:46.510 
cool so you can just imagine when you

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:47.760 
cool so you can just imagine when you
have<00:06:46.690> like<00:06:46.840> a<00:06:46.870> whole<00:06:47.080> bunch<00:06:47.230> of<00:06:47.380> these<00:06:47.500> blocks

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:47.770 
have like a whole bunch of these blocks

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:50.340 
have like a whole bunch of these blocks
together<00:06:48.070> like<00:06:48.910> a<00:06:48.940> bunch<00:06:49.180> of<00:06:49.420> them<00:06:49.600> you're

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:50.350 
together like a bunch of them you're

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:54.260 
together like a bunch of them you're
gonna<00:06:50.410> have<00:06:50.530> it's<00:06:51.280> just<00:06:51.370> just<00:06:51.880> a<00:06:52.060> panoply<00:06:52.720> of
