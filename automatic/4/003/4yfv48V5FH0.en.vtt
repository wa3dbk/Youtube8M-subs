00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:12.099
 the teammate heart get please take a seat 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:14.919
 with our press conference 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:17.990
 can start 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.039
 the traveling journalists from Dortmund to colleagues Joseph Schleck 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:24.730
 of course Klopp can be credible again 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.119
 the first statement 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.909
 Japanese 

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:32.890
 if you missed as a playing ninetieth minute 9 18 minute wins 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.990
 to call oneself happy 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.100
 Who is more about country traumatic football game made 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.850
 passionate really passionate fighting opponents that is 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.560
 made me very hard 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.320
 the over 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.610
 various measures over 90 now remained dangerous 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.940
 in addition to Mainz to zero 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.280
 in another solution where we really had great opportunity 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.660
 maybe for the former to mark the second 0 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.090
 The internist can have stayed game 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.920
 So for the compensation as we are still in a man outnumbered if Sven Bender 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.160
 had to be treated briefly 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.160
 Minute fell the balance change Bussmann say impressive 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.090
 the greed and the way my team then continues on 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.200
 There are some possibilities to play about the three points 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.230
 Some situations were very dangerous 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.120
 Of course, what does she notice? 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.300
 that was an open exchange of blows because as decided in the end for us 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.340
 it would come with too 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.340
 front with an Alba less 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.940
 yes even the banks and stressed SVO never Soldo 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.280
 would be retroactive 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.720
 so far too 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.090
 but also wanted to train in the bundesliga everyday 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.240
 the pleasure demanded 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.820
 despite the higher 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.500
 the trust 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:52.440
 against the 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.440
 a claim settlement 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.670
 I can not blame games 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.670
 they were hoping until the end » 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.300
 Plans others 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.629
 next to the roadway 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.629
 also had belly 

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:17.729
 you also have to have for this purpose 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:20.109
 Peter Yellow 

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:22.619
 after the game first team 

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:25.979
 a point in force 

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:29.659
 because at the first time their many thanks and get to their questions 

00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:34.989
 my short hand signal most of them know the internet 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.989
 I'm coming to the farm and to them 

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:41.939
 Bierhoff thrown 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:44.939
 this is the beginning here 

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:51.739
 because in the middle of the jump 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.019
 played bad but good 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:57.229
 the mood in the first week chat surfing 

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:59.219
 been robbed 

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:00.829
 million damage 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:03.049
 every second household 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:06.049
 I think to myself 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.659
 and how she was before him for redevelopment 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:14.569
 new settlements and appealing Grubes eBay for FIFA 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:17.569
 Euro 

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:22.129
 Oberursel 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:25.129
 on the podium feel comfortable terms 

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:28.039
 certainly 

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:31.509
 But to Essener March Weinert Adreas was almost never really good 

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:36.269
 but no question he was 19 lead and that means on a game Pröll 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.219
 Cologne must come has come 

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:42.469
 Hermann has really made it very difficult for us so far, however 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:47.229
 if it is today and that is actually her, that sets us the same race too 

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:50.209
 seventh consecutive game won when you wave seven games in a row 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:51.729
 Not all win 

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:53.310
 with 3 0 after 60 minutes 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.610
 Guided tours then you play sugar and water you have to bite today 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:57.449
 a game 

00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:00.849
 Cologne was about everything and for us very much 

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:04.259
 when the game is accepted 

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:07.679
 I think in the end not undeserved won 2 1 

00:04:07.679 --> 00:04:09.809
 as I said, even if we respect 

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:13.579
 the decision meanwhile solved the criticism sees that does us nothing and 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:16.579
 who if that too 

00:04:19.749 --> 00:04:21.819
 Cape Town 

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:24.090
 to the annoyance of the microwave 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.770
 resurrected anyway 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.030
 Asamoah Gyan the next question again with microbes 

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:31.270
 ask 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:36.080
 for two hits on the one hand the scene after 2 2 1 0 Lukas Podolski and Michael 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.900
 Ballack again the courage to the Holocaust a Vorgeplänkel the Botnetze the 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:40.439
 other 

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:45.059
 the first ranking since 2006 25 2 nevertheless may have to be temporary 

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:49.439
 something at this early stage 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:53.340
 Part 1 of the question 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.669
 I am 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:58.889
 Customers I see how what emerged from which emotion out of discretion 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:02.009
 small banter came there is a verbal battle 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:04.990
 so that everything is fine is not unproblematic the guys have got off 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:07.129
 met a few days ago 

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:10.620
 Herne were very emotional games 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.020
 just said in those also exercise 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.110
 Face that Roman Weidenfeller Leib made at the final whistle when you 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:17.479
 also do not make a poster 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:20.039
 But that's pure adrenaline 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:22.150
 um and the upper he 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.189
 wants to win so much 

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:26.419
 also has the chance to and accordingly 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:28.689
 There is not much to say about it if you are a bit 

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:31.749
 a few niceties exchanged assists 

00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:35.020
 do not neglect that problematic 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.779
 redistribute leadership 

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:40.110
 We both knew foreplay what could happen if he won 

00:05:40.109 --> 00:05:41.779
 So a logical consequence 

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:44.299
 You would not have to be busy at all but not even over it 

00:05:44.299 --> 00:05:47.409
 neither spoken nor otherwise in Bern 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:50.409
 but if I'm honest, I prefer a night standings than never 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.819
 and accordingly he takes that is just so 

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:56.439
 completely unproblematic 

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:58.590
 Tomorrow can be very different and is complete 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:02.419
 as a cook has no real value, although it is nice that this great 

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:04.400
 Number of said state days 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.469
 That was not just a few days on it 

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:09.309
 it's okay 

00:06:09.309 --> 00:06:12.309
 yes, there are more questions 

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:17.129
 this time again contact with me 

00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:21.379
 so should be rearranged 

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:24.559
 Jung was also around 

00:06:24.559 --> 00:06:26.710
 The gates 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.710
 helps old 

00:06:33.089 --> 00:06:34.150
 projects 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:37.150
 Wolfgang spoke 

00:06:38.369 --> 00:06:39.669
 delicious food 

00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:42.080
 made several thick game 

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.969
 also Chris Kaman r 

00:06:43.969 --> 00:06:46.719
 at the hotel 

00:06:46.719 --> 00:06:49.719
 these seals and spoken 

00:06:50.229 --> 00:06:54.160
 said my decision and we still had to talk 

00:06:56.259 --> 00:06:58.229
 we decided 

00:06:58.229 --> 00:07:01.550
 to measure the knowledge from South Africa 

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:04.059
 Situation after the common 

00:07:04.059 --> 00:07:07.059
 decided on Wednesday together that I drive home 

00:07:07.659 --> 00:07:09.210
 prompt 

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:12.210
 this is what you have to buy 

00:07:14.119 --> 00:07:17.119
 the Eizo questions 

00:07:20.939 --> 00:07:23.239
 then a good journey and thank you for coming
