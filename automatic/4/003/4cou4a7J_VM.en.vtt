00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:12.770 
rogers network so we got a little bit

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:14.140 
rogers network so we got a little bit
later<00:00:12.950> than<00:00:13.100> some<00:00:13.310> of<00:00:13.370> the<00:00:13.460> other<00:00:13.580> networks

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.150 
later than some of the other networks

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.359 
later than some of the other networks
it's<00:00:14.330> a<00:00:14.420> kind<00:00:14.750> of<00:00:14.810> gradual<00:00:15.380> rollout<00:00:15.950> they<00:00:16.249> were

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:16.369 
it's a kind of gradual rollout they were

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:18.700 
it's a kind of gradual rollout they were
looking<00:00:16.460> at<00:00:16.789> so<00:00:17.689> we<00:00:17.779> just<00:00:17.929> got<00:00:18.050> our<00:00:18.289> is<00:00:18.439> about<00:00:18.679> a

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:18.710 
looking at so we just got our is about a

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.380 
looking at so we just got our is about a
week<00:00:19.099> and<00:00:19.220> a<00:00:19.279> half<00:00:19.310> maybe<00:00:19.759> two<00:00:20.029> weeks<00:00:20.119> ago<00:00:20.300> I

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:20.390 
week and a half maybe two weeks ago I

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.339 
week and a half maybe two weeks ago I
played<00:00:20.660> around<00:00:20.810> with<00:00:20.900> it<00:00:21.050> a<00:00:21.109> bit<00:00:21.169> and<00:00:21.669> really

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:23.349 
played around with it a bit and really

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:25.480 
played around with it a bit and really
considering<00:00:24.349> that<00:00:24.619> we<00:00:24.800> have<00:00:24.949> the<00:00:25.099> Galaxy

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:25.490 
considering that we have the Galaxy

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:26.800 
considering that we have the Galaxy
Nexus<00:00:25.669> and<00:00:25.970> things<00:00:26.390> like<00:00:26.480> that<00:00:26.539> out<00:00:26.689> there

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
Nexus and things like that out there

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.419 
Nexus and things like that out there
which<00:00:27.019> is<00:00:27.050> more<00:00:27.289> Google<00:00:27.589> controlled<00:00:27.980> you

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:28.429 
which is more Google controlled you

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:29.349 
which is more Google controlled you
thought<00:00:28.699> that<00:00:28.759> would<00:00:29.029> have<00:00:29.119> been<00:00:29.179> a<00:00:29.239> little

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:29.359 
thought that would have been a little

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:31.450 
thought that would have been a little
bit<00:00:29.539> more<00:00:29.720> of<00:00:30.050> some<00:00:30.409> changes<00:00:30.829> on<00:00:30.919> here<00:00:31.279> and

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
bit more of some changes on here and

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.580 
bit more of some changes on here and

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
recognition which is kind of nice that's

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.200 
recognition which is kind of nice that's
in<00:01:02.809> here<00:01:03.019> now<00:01:03.170> it's<00:01:03.890> it<00:01:04.250> shows<00:01:04.579> in<00:01:04.850> the<00:01:04.970> phone

in here now it's it shows in the phone

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.230 
in here now it's it shows in the phone
is<00:01:05.360> experimental<00:01:06.200> only<00:01:06.710> so<00:01:07.369> it<00:01:07.729> i<00:01:07.880> guess<00:01:08.060> is

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
is experimental only so it i guess is

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.940 
is experimental only so it i guess is
showing<00:01:08.540> that<00:01:08.659> you<00:01:08.720> know<00:01:08.840> it's<00:01:09.229> just<00:01:09.320> it's<00:01:09.680> not

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
showing that you know it's just it's not

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.920 
showing that you know it's just it's not
confirmed<00:01:10.549> it's<00:01:10.939> just<00:01:11.240> not<00:01:11.360> quite<00:01:11.540> on<00:01:11.750> there

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
confirmed it's just not quite on there

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.170 
confirmed it's just not quite on there
but<00:01:12.079> anyways<00:01:12.409> you<00:01:12.590> know<00:01:12.619> that's<00:01:13.310> nothing<00:01:13.549> big

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
but anyways you know that's nothing big

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.600 
but anyways you know that's nothing big

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
things like a la mock locations backward

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.280 
things like a la mock locations backward
passwords<00:03:49.420> there's<00:03:49.720> just<00:03:49.900> all<00:03:50.020> sorts<00:03:50.230> of

there now so it's interesting to see how
that<00:03:54.520> they've<00:03:54.790> kind<00:03:55.060> of<00:03:55.260> expanded<00:03:56.260> that<00:03:56.410> out

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
that they've kind of expanded that out

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.670 
that they've kind of expanded that out
so<00:03:56.920> that's<00:03:57.070> that's<00:03:57.280> pretty<00:03:57.550> cool<00:03:57.850> and<00:03:58.680> also

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
so that's that's pretty cool and also

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
significant was that with the NFC now

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.140 
significant was that with the NFC now
Android<00:04:04.840> Beam<00:04:05.080> and<00:04:05.350> you<00:04:05.770> know<00:04:05.860> they<00:04:06.070> never<00:04:06.250> saw

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
Android Beam and you know they never saw

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.880 
Android Beam and you know they never saw
on<00:04:07.209> this<00:04:07.630> one<00:04:07.810> I<00:04:07.959> have<00:04:08.170> here<00:04:08.200> and<00:04:08.560> on<00:04:08.769> the

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
there not Android Beam directly so it's

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.180 
there not Android Beam directly so it's
interesting<00:04:15.580> to<00:04:15.820> see<00:04:15.970> that's<00:04:16.150> there<00:04:16.390> now

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190
