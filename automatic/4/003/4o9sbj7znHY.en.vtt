sensor and all the wiring checks out

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.450 
sensor and all the wiring checks out
it's<00:00:31.170> getting<00:00:31.260> 5<00:00:31.590> volts<00:00:31.890> like<00:00:32.040> it's<00:00:32.189> supposed

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
it's getting 5 volts like it's supposed

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.639 
it's getting 5 volts like it's supposed
to<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.910> ground<00:00:33.120> is<00:00:33.270> good<00:00:33.480> in<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.870> harness<00:00:34.050> and

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
to the ground is good in the harness and

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.209 
to the ground is good in the harness and
today<00:00:35.040> we're<00:00:35.460> gonna<00:00:35.579> check<00:00:35.670> it<00:00:36.000> with<00:00:36.210> scope

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:37.219 
today we're gonna check it with scope

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:41.090 
today we're gonna check it with scope
which<00:00:38.219> is<00:00:38.250> homemade<00:00:39.180> by<00:00:39.420> me<00:00:39.600> sort<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.410> using

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
which is homemade by me sort of using

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.530 
which is homemade by me sort of using
the<00:00:41.190> sound<00:00:41.399> card<00:00:41.579> of<00:00:41.730> this<00:00:41.850> computer<00:00:42.180> here<00:00:42.360> and

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
the sound card of this computer here and

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.510 
the sound card of this computer here and
it's<00:00:43.350> late<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:43.860> dark<00:00:44.100> out

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
it's late and dark out

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.729 
it's late and dark out
ok<00:00:45.300> so<00:00:45.360> here's<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.719> setup<00:00:46.670> and<00:00:47.670> we<00:00:47.760> have<00:00:47.910> the

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
ok so here's the setup and we have the

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.959 
ok so here's the setup and we have the
sensor<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:50.390> it's<00:00:51.390> got<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.809> tee<00:00:52.320> pin<00:00:52.620> on<00:00:53.399> the

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
sensor and it's got a tee pin on the

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.319 
sensor and it's got a tee pin on the
connector<00:00:54.120> with<00:00:54.899> this<00:00:55.199> little<00:00:55.500> clamp<00:00:55.710> here

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
connector with this little clamp here

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:03.880 
connector with this little clamp here
which<00:00:57.329> leads<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.930> my<00:00:59.239> homemade<00:01:02.239> voltage

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
which leads to my homemade voltage

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.070 
which leads to my homemade voltage
Deeley<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:05.489> step<00:01:05.970> that<00:01:06.090> voltage<00:01:06.450> down<00:01:06.630> so<00:01:06.900> that

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
Deeley to step that voltage down so that

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.600 
Deeley to step that voltage down so that
the<00:01:08.119> sound<00:01:09.119> card<00:01:09.270> doesn't<00:01:09.479> get<00:01:09.659> fried<00:01:10.610> and

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
the sound card doesn't get fried and

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.560 
the sound card doesn't get fried and
then<00:01:12.210> we<00:01:12.360> have<00:01:14.180> scope<00:01:15.180> software<00:01:15.659> running<00:01:15.869> here

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
then we have scope software running here

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.870 
then we have scope software running here
and<00:01:18.570> I'm<00:01:19.020> about<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.320> crank<00:01:19.710> it<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.400> sort<00:01:20.820> of

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
and I'm about to crank it and sort of

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.999 
and I'm about to crank it and sort of
show<00:01:21.119> off<00:01:21.330> one<00:01:21.570> it's<00:01:21.720> actually<00:01:21.869> doing<00:01:22.320> just

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
show off one it's actually doing just

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:23.960 
show off one it's actually doing just
the<00:01:23.070> documents<00:01:23.490> like<00:01:23.580> we've<00:01:23.729> got<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.880> good

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
the documents like we've got a good

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:35.469 
the documents like we've got a good
signal<00:01:24.360> here

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.300 

so<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:36.750> means<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.530> signal<00:01:37.920> is<00:01:38.070> good

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
so that means that the signal is good

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.090 
so that means that the signal is good
from<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.790> sensor<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:40.020> service<00:01:40.770> manual

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
from the sensor and service manual

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.660 
from the sensor and service manual
actually<00:01:41.280> says<00:01:41.729> that<00:01:42.420> after<00:01:42.690> this<00:01:43.670> what's

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
actually says that after this what's

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.899 
actually says that after this what's
supposed<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:45.000> happen<00:01:45.090> is<00:01:46.040> the<00:01:47.040> ECM<00:01:47.460> is<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.790> be

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
supposed to happen is the ECM is to be

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.070 
supposed to happen is the ECM is to be
replaced<00:01:49.040> which<00:01:50.040> is<00:01:50.159> right<00:01:50.310> here<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:51.080> this

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
replaced which is right here and this

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.570 
replaced which is right here and this
actually<00:01:52.380> should<00:01:52.440> be<00:01:52.680> under<00:01:53.250> missions

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
actually should be under missions

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.850 
actually should be under missions
warranty<00:01:54.030> being<00:01:54.930> that<00:01:55.080> the<00:01:55.170> car<00:01:55.380> still<00:01:55.770> has

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
diagnosed and hopefully to have that ECM

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.699 
diagnosed and hopefully to have that ECM
replaced<00:02:12.150> I<00:02:12.480> just<00:02:13.170> wanted<00:02:13.350> to<00:02:13.470> do<00:02:13.590> the

that<00:02:17.720> it<00:02:18.720> is<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:19.260> ECU<00:02:19.680> which<00:02:19.830> it<00:02:19.950> looks<00:02:20.069> like

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
that it is the ECU which it looks like

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.180 
that it is the ECU which it looks like
so<00:02:20.940> I<00:02:20.970> have<00:02:21.269> an<00:02:21.390> ECU<00:02:21.750> failure<00:02:22.760> on<00:02:23.760> this<00:02:23.970> vehicle
