00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.150
 well today the sky is blue before 20 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.840
 Minutes still rained and flashed and 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.880
 thundered and I cut it at first april 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.290
 first a relatively serious video even 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.490
 out so do not worry, this is not a 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:22.320
 stupid april joke now but it works 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:24.630
 That's why I have none at the last gate 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.890
 idea saturday but sometime on 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.720
 every case in front of a week ago 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.380
 i said yes okay i do not have it 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.090

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.540

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.239

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.850
 daniel down syndrome came and for it 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.739
 yesterday a new format karlburg but 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.239
 wanted to test how it arrives and 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.430
 I'm sorry I know it was the one 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.190
 Wrong time to test a format 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.530
 because I have announced that daniel 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.930
 because our trump comes and it came just 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.550
 not that was because I was ten days 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.289
 have no internet and then have 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.640
 Of course, a little bit dammed up 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.800
 what I had to catch up with and so on 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.719
 and somehow I had that day where 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.859
 I had internet I just had it 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.480
 first of all, feel free to join us again 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.739
 lets my friends with daniel with and 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.630
 with crispy and so to speak 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.450
 than then stop me again directly 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.189
 to rush into work and I'm really 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.530
 sorry then again under pressure comes for it 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.570
 on saturday because i would like one too 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.159
 keep the tradition 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.479
 saturday always a video like daniel 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.430
 down syndrome or ten doctor or 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.500
 something different and me 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.070
 Yesterday I tried new format too 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.420
 bring 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.130
 he does not really have that right now 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.560
 so that found the appeal 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.479
 now not so many great this is such a 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.829
 Let's just say that, I have it 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.560
 I promised it when I returned 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.380
 internet there is a nice fir 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.180
 partner so beautiful so nice fir flavor 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.670
 you have all been looking forward to it 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.939
 but then came a real and 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.009
 lavender what nobody really wants and 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.659
 that explains a bit why 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.570
 So many people were disappointed 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:53.729
 I was also too bombed with 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.040
 Messages still written in caps 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.540
 were with a how could it be you that you 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.469
 no trade there and brings and everything and 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.479
 I am also sorry I have it 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.450
 announced and it did not come 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.320
 just stop 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:07.180
 something more private as well in the 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.360
 time where I just do not have internet 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.530
 I thought so boah 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.970
 actually somehow very cool times 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.410
 something new to bring then if I 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.540
 internet but it was just that 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:17.950
 wrong time and I'm sorry 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.800
 I also have a stream 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.930
 announced that even comes today 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.650
 welcome back internet stream in the 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.090

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.560
 crispy and leaves as the last comes 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.620
 I have not been there all day 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.700
 I have no idea what he does and 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.170
 we'll be on mine a little bit more 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.420
 server game no life point net you 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.670
 Of course, you can always 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.900
 still it is still great because we are 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.730
 still have to test things out 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.510
 and besides, it is also a smaller one 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.579
 donate stream because daniel has no money 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.140
 to order gta 5 before so 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:50.709
 really he really has no money that is 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.810
 no joke 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:54.130
 That's why I kind of like to stop 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.829
 allow him to gta 5 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.840
 presented what a week believes 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:01.540
 close to two weeks, gta 5 comes out for pc 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.069
 and in any case is bad at 18 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.290
 I hope you are there and 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:07.000
 I actually wanted to go today 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.120
 bring a new format 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.350
 but then I thought about it myself 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.730
 Do not think that we really are now 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:14.380

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.180

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.069

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.680

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:23.049

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:34.030
 The telekom has also been real 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.530

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.630

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.880

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.440

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.060

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.790

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:41.020

 written and the only ones 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.040
 only ones that really depends on when 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.229
 the telecom 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.700
 these are the ones on twitter via twitter 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:53.440
 it is like that if for example 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:55.210
 anyone builds on twitter shit 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.610
 they always write their names 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:00.520
 if you call by phone they say yes 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:02.979
 Lord you have no plan who that is almost 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.660

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.870
 guys do something and you can 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.060
 Do not reach them anymore if you are 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.430
 you want to complain you say it and 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:14.320
 Client advisor yes no idea of ​​the can

 not read his name correctly what 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.150
 If I have any case then I will 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.530
 through twitter that everything is regulated 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.729
 publicly by tweeting this can always be 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:24.039
 track whole 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:26.950
 I have my phone through twitter 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:29.350
 booked for internet contract so completely 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:31.990
 honest age that's right 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:33.610
 and professional from the telekom that 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.560
 you just can not reach anyone 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.270
 because I mean I do not have an entertainer 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:39.160
 booked I wanted to complain 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.500
 but you have indeed to his comic 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.660
 Client consultants go where you do not relate 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.990
 to have and one simply his 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.560
 can not even say the right name 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:50.620
 at least that's what's going on again 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.270
 internet and I'm really pissed in 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.889
 the time I have my case 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.780
 you wonder how I am my days 

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:58.660
 I've spent it 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:00.160
 but sat and thought about something 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:02.320
 i can do for ten kinds in the 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.419
 next time which formats i will do 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:09.180
 can where the one format is also yesterday 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:12.389
 came and watched movies and that was 

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.710
 Really really shit boring because 

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:14.789
 just stop you know you know it yes 

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:16.740
 I own my internet though 

00:06:14.789 --> 00:06:19.710
 meanwhile this is my job 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:22.949
 my job and without internet is really rubbish 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:25.020
 but in any case today at 18 o'clock 

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:27.960
 red bulls on my server one more 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:30.630
 few things stream I hope you are 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:32.340
 and I hope that the telekom in 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:34.800
 the next time in the near future 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:38.460
 a little more professional is because of it 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:41.190
 can not be that easy just 

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:43.259
 some shit goes in the contract 

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:45.630
 I mean if you have a fucking cola 

00:06:43.259 --> 00:06:47.669
 ordered then you do not want that there 

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:49.259
 anyone fits in or something like that 

00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:51.720
 you just want ne cola you do not want any 

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:52.889
 piste euro cola you want a cola and 

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.110
 You want the price for a cola 

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:58.440
 paid and not the price for passes 

00:06:55.110 --> 00:07:01.070
 and cola the whole is a pretty good one 

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:03.419
 Comparison in any case, my joy 

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:04.130
 I hope you are not disappointed that 

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:07.349
 not otherwise 

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:09.330
 I hope he comes he can handle it 

00:07:07.349 --> 00:07:10.710
 me, me, me, I know it's real 

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:12.930
 that's why daniel shit on now 

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:14.940
 Monday light came but I hope it is 

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:16.169
 not so bad for you i want 

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:17.310
 simply maintaining the rhythm again
