I'm<00:03:55.569> at<00:03:55.690> the<00:03:55.720> playground<00:03:56.200> oh<00:03:56.380> no<00:03:56.590> Abbi<00:04:02.370> the

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
I'm at the playground oh no Abbi the

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.259 
I'm at the playground oh no Abbi the
concrete<00:04:04.500> we<00:04:05.500> have<00:04:05.650> some<00:04:05.920> ship<00:04:06.400> being<00:04:06.910> on<00:04:07.120> the

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
concrete we have some ship being on the

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:11.190 
concrete we have some ship being on the
front<00:04:08.880> we've<00:04:09.880> actually<00:04:10.090> cracked<00:04:10.690> the<00:04:11.019> glass

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
front we've actually cracked the glass

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.470 
front we've actually cracked the glass
on<00:04:11.739> the<00:04:11.950> back<00:04:12.130> it<00:04:12.459> could<00:04:12.640> have<00:04:12.819> been<00:04:13.000> already

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
on the back it could have been already

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.300 
on the back it could have been already
in<00:04:13.630> a<00:04:13.720> weakened<00:04:14.110> condition<00:04:14.230> but<00:04:14.890> that<00:04:15.130> was

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
in a weakened condition but that was

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.210 
in a weakened condition but that was
only<00:04:15.549> one<00:04:15.910> drop<00:04:16.180> but<00:04:17.019> I<00:04:17.380> think<00:04:17.859> we<00:04:17.979> need<00:04:18.130> to

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
only one drop but I think we need to

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.020 
only one drop but I think we need to
keep<00:04:18.340> dropping<00:04:18.549> it

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
keep dropping it

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:27.000 
keep dropping it
how<00:04:19.720> about<00:04:19.870> shoulder<00:04:20.290> height<00:04:25.770> okay<00:04:26.770> looks

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
how about shoulder height okay looks

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.490 
how about shoulder height okay looks
like<00:04:27.190> no<00:04:27.370> more<00:04:27.610> problems

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
like no more problems

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:36.450 
like no more problems
one<00:04:29.500> more<00:04:29.740> ear<00:04:30.310> height

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.040 

if<00:04:37.460> you<00:04:37.639> only<00:04:37.849> looked<00:04:38.210> at<00:04:38.300> it<00:04:38.449> from<00:04:38.539> the<00:04:38.719> front

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
if you only looked at it from the front

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:41.739 
if you only looked at it from the front
you<00:04:39.319> would<00:04:39.469> say<00:04:39.620> this<00:04:39.830> bone<00:04:40.069> is<00:04:40.189> amazing<00:04:40.749> it's

00:04:41.739 --> 00:04:41.749 
you would say this bone is amazing it's

00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:45.850 
you would say this bone is amazing it's
this<00:04:42.080> view<00:04:42.580> that's<00:04:43.580> the<00:04:43.819> problem<00:04:44.499> now<00:04:45.499> let's

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
this view that's the problem now let's

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.170 
this view that's the problem now let's
see<00:04:45.949> if<00:04:46.039> the<00:04:46.159> actual<00:04:46.550> phone<00:04:46.759> is<00:04:46.969> still

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
see if the actual phone is still

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.579 
see if the actual phone is still
functional<00:04:49.300> comes<00:04:50.300> on<00:04:50.539> looks<00:04:51.289> like<00:04:51.409> we<00:04:51.499> don't

00:04:51.579 --> 00:04:51.589 
functional comes on looks like we don't

00:04:51.589 --> 00:04:53.709 
functional comes on looks like we don't
have<00:04:51.770> any<00:04:51.919> screen<00:04:52.550> damage<00:04:53.089> like<00:04:53.300> we<00:04:53.419> did<00:04:53.569> with

00:04:53.709 --> 00:04:53.719 
have any screen damage like we did with

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:57.249 
have any screen damage like we did with
the<00:04:53.809> 4s<00:04:54.729> so<00:04:55.729> the<00:04:56.089> phone<00:04:56.330> is<00:04:56.360> still<00:04:56.719> functional

00:04:57.249 --> 00:04:57.259 
the 4s so the phone is still functional

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:00.369 
the 4s so the phone is still functional
but<00:04:57.469> I<00:04:57.680> think<00:04:57.919> with<00:04:58.069> a<00:04:58.189> cracked<00:04:58.610> back<00:04:59.379> we're

00:05:00.369 --> 00:05:00.379 
but I think with a cracked back we're

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:12.129 
but I think with a cracked back we're
gonna<00:05:00.439> have<00:05:00.650> to<00:05:00.740> call<00:05:00.860> this<00:05:01.009> one<00:05:01.069> a<00:05:01.189> fail<00:05:11.139> still

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:12.139 
gonna have to call this one a fail still

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:13.899 
gonna have to call this one a fail still
functional<00:05:12.740> after<00:05:12.889> the<00:05:13.099> drop<00:05:13.339> despite<00:05:13.759> the

00:05:13.899 --> 00:05:13.909 
functional after the drop despite the

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:15.760 
functional after the drop despite the
cracks<00:05:14.180> let's<00:05:14.749> see<00:05:14.930> how<00:05:15.199> the<00:05:15.259> iPhone<00:05:15.589> 5

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
cracks let's see how the iPhone 5

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:20.230 
cracks let's see how the iPhone 5
handles<00:05:16.189> water<00:05:16.669> oh<00:05:18.219> no<00:05:19.219> I<00:05:19.249> dropped<00:05:19.639> it<00:05:19.999> in<00:05:20.089> the

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
handles water oh no I dropped it in the

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.679 
handles water oh no I dropped it in the
toilet

00:05:20.679 --> 00:05:20.689 
toilet

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:24.700 
toilet
ah<00:05:22.330> this<00:05:23.330> is<00:05:23.479> the<00:05:23.539> part<00:05:23.779> where<00:05:23.899> I<00:05:23.930> overcome<00:05:24.559> my

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
ah this is the part where I overcome my

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:29.980 
ah this is the part where I overcome my
fear<00:05:24.889> of<00:05:24.919> germs<00:05:28.270> screen<00:05:29.270> still<00:05:29.449> on<00:05:29.629> by<00:05:29.779> the<00:05:29.839> way

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:29.990 
fear of germs screen still on by the way

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:34.829 
fear of germs screen still on by the way
very<00:05:30.919> similar<00:05:31.279> to<00:05:31.430> our<00:05:31.520> iPhone<00:05:31.879> 4s<00:05:33.309> bubbling

00:05:34.829 --> 00:05:34.839 
very similar to our iPhone 4s bubbling

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:36.909 
very similar to our iPhone 4s bubbling
probably<00:05:35.839> get<00:05:35.959> it<00:05:36.050> out<00:05:36.139> a<00:05:36.169> little<00:05:36.439> faster<00:05:36.800> than

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:36.919 
probably get it out a little faster than

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:38.320 
probably get it out a little faster than
that<00:05:37.069> if<00:05:37.219> you<00:05:37.370> really<00:05:37.639> drop<00:05:37.819> yours<00:05:38.149> in<00:05:38.270> the

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330 
that if you really drop yours in the

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:48.690 
the drop test at the end when I was a

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:50.900 
the drop test at the end when I was a
little<00:06:48.990> bit<00:06:49.110> shocked<00:06:49.500> by<00:06:50.190> all<00:06:50.220> the<00:06:50.520> damage

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:50.910 
little bit shocked by all the damage

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:52.460 
little bit shocked by all the damage
that<00:06:50.940> we<00:06:51.270> had<00:06:51.360> caused<00:06:51.570> by<00:06:51.780> dropping<00:06:52.140> this<00:06:52.230> gun

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:52.470 
that we had caused by dropping this gun

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:56.810 
that we had caused by dropping this gun
I<00:06:52.680> declared<00:06:53.400> it<00:06:53.580> a<00:06:53.700> failure<00:06:55.220> but<00:06:56.220> on<00:06:56.370> second

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:56.820 
I declared it a failure but on second

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:58.940 
I declared it a failure but on second
thought<00:06:57.030> I<00:06:57.300> think<00:06:57.840> I<00:06:58.110> have<00:06:58.230> to<00:06:58.350> take<00:06:58.500> that<00:06:58.740> back

00:06:58.940 --> 00:06:58.950 
thought I think I have to take that back

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:01.640 
thought I think I have to take that back
I<00:06:59.310> mean<00:06:59.730> it's<00:07:00.090> totally<00:07:00.480> functional<00:07:01.110> if<00:07:01.530> you

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:01.650 
I mean it's totally functional if you

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:03.260 
I mean it's totally functional if you
put<00:07:01.830> a<00:07:01.860> case<00:07:02.100> on<00:07:02.340> the<00:07:02.430> back<00:07:02.580> you'd<00:07:02.820> still<00:07:03.090> be

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:03.270 
put a case on the back you'd still be

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:06.440 
put a case on the back you'd still be
perfectly<00:07:03.720> happy<00:07:04.050> to<00:07:04.080> have<00:07:04.320> it<00:07:04.500> so<00:07:05.160> on<00:07:05.520> second

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:06.450 
perfectly happy to have it so on second

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:10.460 
perfectly happy to have it so on second
thought<00:07:06.600> it's<00:07:07.440> a<00:07:07.560> pass<00:07:08.990> overall<00:07:09.990> I'd<00:07:10.200> say<00:07:10.230> the

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:10.470 
thought it's a pass overall I'd say the

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:13.370 
thought it's a pass overall I'd say the
iPhone<00:07:10.740> 5<00:07:10.950> is<00:07:10.980> very<00:07:11.640> tough<00:07:12.000> but<00:07:12.360> also<00:07:12.540> not<00:07:13.140> that

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:13.380 
iPhone 5 is very tough but also not that

00:07:13.380 --> 00:07:15.620 
iPhone 5 is very tough but also not that
tough<00:07:13.680> compared<00:07:14.400> to<00:07:14.490> the<00:07:14.580> Samsung<00:07:14.970> Galaxy<00:07:15.420> s3

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:15.630 
tough compared to the Samsung Galaxy s3

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:17.870 
tough compared to the Samsung Galaxy s3
which<00:07:16.200> went<00:07:16.410> through<00:07:16.590> all<00:07:16.860> the<00:07:17.160> same<00:07:17.370> tests

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:17.880 
which went through all the same tests

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:20.570 
which went through all the same tests
this<00:07:18.300> obviously<00:07:18.960> came<00:07:19.170> out<00:07:19.350> pretty<00:07:19.860> damaged

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:20.580 
this obviously came out pretty damaged

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:23.330 
this obviously came out pretty damaged
and<00:07:20.940> our<00:07:21.180> s3<00:07:21.630> had<00:07:21.810> no<00:07:22.140> scratches<00:07:22.650> at<00:07:22.740> all<00:07:22.890> that
