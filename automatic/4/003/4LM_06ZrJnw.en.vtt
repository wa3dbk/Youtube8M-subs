sixteenth of a pencil thickness we're

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:57.810 
sixteenth of a pencil thickness we're
going<00:02:55.720> to<00:02:55.810> use<00:02:55.930> those<00:02:56.110> light<00:02:56.440> those<00:02:56.830> tips<00:02:57.460> for

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
the legs so we're going to let them to

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
the legs so we're going to let them to
extend<00:02:59.760> out<00:03:00.760> the<00:03:01.030> front<00:03:01.360> there<00:03:03.540> so<00:03:04.950> tie<00:03:05.950> that

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
extend out the front there so tie that

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.350 
extend out the front there so tie that
down<00:03:07.920> nice<00:03:08.920> and<00:03:08.950> tight<00:03:09.370> so<00:03:09.670> it<00:03:09.700> doesn't<00:03:09.850> spin

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
down nice and tight so it doesn't spin

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:19.860 
down nice and tight so it doesn't spin
first<00:03:13.170> wrap<00:03:14.170> it<00:03:14.320> up<00:03:14.470> and<00:03:14.740> bring<00:03:15.160> it<00:03:15.220> back<00:03:18.870> now

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
I'm going to take a dark brown I'm going

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:33.020 
I'm going to take a dark brown I'm going
to<00:03:27.489> take<00:03:27.580> a<00:03:27.640> dark<00:03:27.940> brown<00:03:28.500> superfine<00:03:29.500> dubbing

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:39.740 

this<00:03:34.030> is<00:03:34.239> dry<00:03:34.480> fly<00:03:37.080> and<00:03:38.080> this<00:03:38.680> is<00:03:38.860> more

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
this is dry fly and this is more

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.449 
this is dry fly and this is more
buoyancy<00:03:40.750> with<00:03:41.350> the<00:03:41.470> dry<00:03:41.709> fly<00:03:41.980> it<00:03:42.040> floats

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
buoyancy with the dry fly it floats

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.540 
buoyancy with the dry fly it floats
better<00:03:43.680> that's<00:03:44.680> what<00:03:44.860> we<00:03:44.950> want<00:03:45.130> this<00:03:45.250> fly<00:03:45.489> to

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:45.550 
better that's what we want this fly to

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.500 
better that's what we want this fly to
do<00:03:45.820> is<00:03:46.060> to<00:03:46.269> float<00:03:46.570> on<00:03:46.989> the<00:03:47.050> surface<00:03:47.350> film<00:03:48.510> and

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
do is to float on the surface film and

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:57.479 
do is to float on the surface film and
we're<00:03:49.630> going<00:03:49.870> to<00:03:52.590> wrap<00:03:53.590> our<00:03:53.769> thorax<00:03:56.280> and<00:03:57.280> when

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
we're going to wrap our thorax and when

00:03:57.489 --> 00:03:58.680 
we're going to wrap our thorax and when
we<00:03:57.580> come<00:03:57.700> up<00:03:57.880> to<00:03:58.030> the<00:03:58.120> front<00:03:58.150> we're<00:03:58.510> going<00:03:58.630> to

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
we come up to the front we're going to

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.509 
we come up to the front we're going to
grab<00:03:58.900> the<00:03:59.140> legs<00:04:02.010> and<00:04:03.010> we're<00:04:03.160> going<00:04:03.280> to<00:04:03.310> put<00:04:03.400> a

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
grab the legs and we're going to put a

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:11.450 
grab the legs and we're going to put a
few<00:04:03.730> wraps<00:04:03.970> right<00:04:04.209> in<00:04:04.360> front

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:11.460 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.620 

and<00:04:12.460> now<00:04:12.610> we're<00:04:12.760> going<00:04:12.850> to<00:04:12.910> take<00:04:13.180> those<00:04:13.360> legs

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:13.630 
and now we're going to take those legs

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:18.090 
and now we're going to take those legs
and<00:04:13.780> we're<00:04:13.870> going<00:04:13.990> to<00:04:14.050> divide<00:04:14.230> them<00:04:17.100> this

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
and we're going to divide them this

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.920 
and we're going to divide them this
isn't<00:04:18.459> real<00:04:18.640> easy<00:04:18.910> being<00:04:19.360> that<00:04:19.570> they're<00:04:19.750> so

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
isn't real easy being that they're so
