00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:16.730 
going to be talking about wall running

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.730 
going to be talking about wall running
specifically<00:00:17.730> in<00:00:17.939> out<00:00:18.210> wall<00:00:18.450> running<00:00:18.750> so

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
specifically in out wall running so

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.430 
specifically in out wall running so
here's<00:00:19.920> a<00:00:19.980> wall<00:00:20.189> here<00:00:20.430> I<00:00:20.640> can<00:00:21.510> parkour<00:00:22.080> all<00:00:22.320> the

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:22.440 
here's a wall here I can parkour all the

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.910 
here's a wall here I can parkour all the
way<00:00:22.560> along<00:00:22.770> and<00:00:22.980> jump<00:00:23.490> off<00:00:23.609> at<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.789> end<00:00:24.920> now

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
way along and jump off at the end now

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.250 
way along and jump off at the end now
let's<00:00:26.340> say<00:00:26.550> that<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.850> player<00:00:27.090> decides<00:00:27.900> not<00:00:28.199> to

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
let's say that the player decides not to

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.620 
let's say that the player decides not to
jump<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:28.920> instead<00:00:29.310> hits<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.730> wall<00:00:29.880> you<00:00:30.420> fall

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
jump and instead hits the wall you fall

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.359 
jump and instead hits the wall you fall
straight<00:00:30.810> to<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.140> floor<00:00:31.260> and<00:00:31.590> you'd<00:00:32.189> have<00:00:32.309> a

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
straight to the floor and you'd have a

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.549 
straight to the floor and you'd have a
deaf<00:00:32.640> zone<00:00:32.879> down<00:00:33.090> there<00:00:33.150> this<00:00:33.930> also<00:00:34.230> allows

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
deaf zone down there this also allows

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.470 
deaf zone down there this also allows
the<00:00:34.769> player<00:00:34.949> to<00:00:34.980> jump<00:00:35.370> at<00:00:35.610> any<00:00:35.820> time<00:00:36.150> so<00:00:36.390> you

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
the player to jump at any time so you

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.740 
the player to jump at any time so you
could<00:00:36.570> jump<00:00:36.809> midway<00:00:37.290> across<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.340> wall

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.270 

okay<00:00:42.750> so<00:00:42.810> for<00:00:43.200> this<00:00:43.290> you're<00:00:43.530> going<00:00:43.650> to<00:00:43.800> need<00:00:44.070> a

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
okay so for this you're going to need a

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.040 
okay so for this you're going to need a
broadcast<00:00:44.820> microchip<00:00:45.480> timer<00:00:46.760> mover<00:00:47.809> in<00:00:48.809> out

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
broadcast microchip timer mover in out

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.680 
broadcast microchip timer mover in out
mover<00:00:50.120> not<00:00:51.120> gate<00:00:51.450> and<00:00:52.070> gate<00:00:53.690> character

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
mover not gate and gate character

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.759 
mover not gate and gate character
animation<00:00:55.230> Tweaker<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:56.430> controller<00:00:56.820> later

00:00:57.759 --> 00:00:57.769 
animation Tweaker and a controller later

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:00.650 
animation Tweaker and a controller later
okay<00:00:58.769> so<00:00:58.830> we<00:00:59.010> have<00:00:59.129> our<00:00:59.160> wall<00:00:59.489> here<00:00:59.519> now<00:01:00.510> we're

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
okay so we have our wall here now we're

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.970 
okay so we have our wall here now we're
going<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.900> grab<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.170> piece<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.530> invisible

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
going to grab a piece of invisible

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.979 
going to grab a piece of invisible
material<00:01:02.100> I<00:01:02.580> used<00:01:03.150> sticker<00:01:03.390> panel<00:01:03.720> you<00:01:03.870> can

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
material I used sticker panel you can

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.910 
material I used sticker panel you can
use<00:01:04.110> hologram<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:05.030> we're<00:01:06.030> going<00:01:06.300> to<00:01:06.450> place

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
use hologram and we're going to place

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.350 
use hologram and we're going to place
we're<00:01:07.920> going<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.160> be<00:01:08.220> using<00:01:08.610> this<00:01:08.729> small<00:01:08.880> grid

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
we're going to be using this small grid

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.840 
we're going to be using this small grid
so<00:01:10.020> we<00:01:10.110> get<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.259> small<00:01:10.500> little<00:01:10.740> box<00:01:10.890> we're<00:01:11.700> going

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
so we get a small little box we're going

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.690 
so we get a small little box we're going
to<00:01:11.940> place<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.420> one<00:01:12.750> grid<00:01:13.470> space<00:01:13.800> away<00:01:14.340> from<00:01:14.369> the

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
to place it one grid space away from the

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.170 
to place it one grid space away from the
wall<00:01:15.619> then<00:01:16.619> we're<00:01:16.830> going<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.130> have<00:01:17.369> it<00:01:17.580> all

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
wall then we're going to have it all

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.389 
wall then we're going to have it all
across<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.869> wall<00:01:19.050> so<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.800> layers<00:01:20.039> of<00:01:20.310> the

00:01:20.389 --> 00:01:20.399 
across the wall so the layers of the

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:25.310 
across the wall so the layers of the
wall<00:01:22.280> then<00:01:23.280> we<00:01:23.310> make<00:01:23.580> it<00:01:23.729> invisible<00:01:23.940> and<00:01:24.539> then

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
wall then we make it invisible and then

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.710 
wall then we make it invisible and then
we're<00:01:25.470> going<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.740> stick<00:01:26.070> on<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.479> four<00:01:27.479> class

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
we're going to stick on a four class

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.760 
we're going to stick on a four class
microchip

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.080 

in<00:01:32.770> the<00:01:32.920> settings<00:01:33.369> of<00:01:33.520> the<00:01:33.579> broadcast

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
in the settings of the broadcast

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.749 
in the settings of the broadcast
microchip<00:01:34.749> wanted<00:01:35.649> to<00:01:35.770> be<00:01:35.859> all<00:01:36.069> in<00:01:36.249> contact

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
microchip wanted to be all in contact

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:39.059 
microchip wanted to be all in contact
and<00:01:36.999> to<00:01:37.509> allow<00:01:37.780> touching<00:01:38.499> so<00:01:38.679> to<00:01:38.740> conclude

00:01:39.059 --> 00:01:39.069 
and to allow touching so to conclude

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:43.169 
and to allow touching so to conclude
touching<00:01:41.009> then<00:01:42.009> we<00:01:42.369> want<00:01:42.549> our<00:01:42.729> controller

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:43.179 
touching then we want our controller

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:45.599 
touching then we want our controller
later<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:44.590> we<00:01:44.679> want<00:01:44.859> our<00:01:44.950> controller<00:01:45.369> later

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:45.609 
later and we want our controller later

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:53.270 
later and we want our controller later
will<00:01:46.060> be<00:01:46.149> a<00:01:46.179> receiver<00:01:46.709> of<00:01:47.709> the<00:01:48.009> nearest<00:01:48.640> player

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.249 

next<00:01:54.280> up<00:01:54.579> we<00:01:54.759> want<00:01:54.939> our<00:01:55.149> in<00:01:55.450> out<00:01:55.659> mover<00:01:56.049> and

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
next up we want our in out mover and

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:57.419 
next up we want our in out mover and
we're<00:01:56.409> going<00:01:56.560> to<00:01:56.649> place<00:01:56.799> that<00:01:56.829> inside<00:01:57.250> the

controller later and then begin to have
a<00:02:00.729> speed<00:02:01.060> of<00:02:01.209> around<00:02:01.299> four<00:02:01.810> that's<00:02:02.500> the<00:02:02.679> speed

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
a speed of around four that's the speed

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.410 
a speed of around four that's the speed
at<00:02:03.099> which<00:02:03.329> your<00:02:04.329> sack<00:02:05.020> moves<00:02:05.759> then<00:02:06.759> we<00:02:07.119> need<00:02:07.299> to

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
at which your sack moves then we need to

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.650 
at which your sack moves then we need to
press<00:02:07.659> r2<00:02:07.929> on<00:02:08.560> the<00:02:09.340> sticker<00:02:09.579> panel<00:02:09.940> to<00:02:10.450> see

jump so we want a timer we're going to
set<00:02:30.670> this<00:02:30.879> to<00:02:31.090> null<00:02:32.079> point<00:02:32.470> five<00:02:32.769> and<00:02:33.370> we

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
set this to null point five and we

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:38.610 
set this to null point five and we
wanted<00:02:33.700> to<00:02:33.760> a<00:02:33.849> countdown<00:02:34.299> timer<00:02:37.380> then<00:02:38.380> we<00:02:38.500> are

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
wanted to a countdown timer then we are

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.339 
wanted to a countdown timer then we are
going<00:02:38.769> to<00:02:38.920> attach<00:02:39.220> the<00:02:39.459> X<00:02:39.730> button<00:02:40.319> into<00:02:41.319> the

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
going to attach the X button into the

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:44.690 
going to attach the X button into the
timer<00:02:42.060> then<00:02:43.060> we<00:02:43.180> are<00:02:43.299> going<00:02:43.450> to<00:02:43.569> get<00:02:43.750> our<00:02:43.930> mover

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
timer then we are going to get our mover

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.120 
timer then we are going to get our mover
now<00:02:45.700> mine<00:02:46.150> is<00:02:46.180> jumping<00:02:46.930> to<00:02:47.139> the<00:02:47.290> right<00:02:47.500> so<00:02:47.980> I'm

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
now mine is jumping to the right so I'm

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.309 
now mine is jumping to the right so I'm
going<00:02:48.370> to<00:02:48.519> need<00:02:48.730> write<00:02:49.180> movement<00:02:49.810> I'm<00:02:50.139> going

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 
going to need write movement I'm going

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:52.110 
going to need write movement I'm going
to<00:02:50.380> have<00:02:50.470> three<00:02:50.739> write<00:02:50.950> movement<00:02:51.400> and<00:02:51.849> three

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
to have three write movement and three

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.300 
to have three write movement and three
up<00:02:52.299> movement<00:02:52.810> then<00:02:53.650> I'm<00:02:53.769> going<00:02:54.010> to<00:02:54.069> want<00:02:54.280> a

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
up movement then I'm going to want a

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.099 
up movement then I'm going to want a
hundred<00:02:54.519> percent<00:02:54.730> acceleration<00:02:55.540> but<00:02:55.810> no

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:56.109 
hundred percent acceleration but no

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:58.349 
hundred percent acceleration but no
deceleration<00:02:56.919> if<00:02:57.489> yours<00:02:57.760> is<00:02:57.910> going<00:02:58.060> to<00:02:58.150> the

00:02:58.349 --> 00:02:58.359 
deceleration if yours is going to the

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:00.890 
deceleration if yours is going to the
left<00:02:58.630> we're<00:02:59.290> going<00:02:59.470> to<00:02:59.560> need<00:02:59.680> minus<00:03:00.190> three

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
left we're going to need minus three

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:09.140 
left we're going to need minus three
then<00:03:01.900> attach<00:03:02.380> your<00:03:02.410> timer<00:03:03.010> into<00:03:03.669> your<00:03:03.970> mover

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.800 

then<00:03:10.150> we're<00:03:10.359> going<00:03:10.599> to<00:03:10.720> want<00:03:10.959> to<00:03:11.109> not<00:03:11.470> gates

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
then we're going to want to not gates

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.180 
then we're going to want to not gates
I'm<00:03:13.810> just<00:03:14.019> going<00:03:14.230> to<00:03:14.290> close<00:03:14.500> for<00:03:14.799> a<00:03:14.859> second

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
I'm just going to close for a second

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.670 
I'm just going to close for a second
because<00:03:15.310> this<00:03:15.579> is<00:03:15.639> really<00:03:16.299> messy<00:03:16.690> so<00:03:17.410> I'm<00:03:17.530> just

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
because this is really messy so I'm just

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.080 
because this is really messy so I'm just
going<00:03:17.919> to<00:03:17.980> move<00:03:18.220> things<00:03:18.400> around<00:03:18.579> again<00:03:18.970> to

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
going to move things around again to

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.820 
going to move things around again to
move<00:03:19.239> our<00:03:19.419> jump<00:03:19.720> over<00:03:20.049> here

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.070 

I'm<00:03:23.250> just<00:03:23.520> going<00:03:23.700> to<00:03:23.760> make<00:03:23.940> it<00:03:24.000> a<00:03:24.210> lot<00:03:24.480> neater

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
I'm just going to make it a lot neater

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.500 
I'm just going to make it a lot neater
we<00:03:25.650> need<00:03:25.800> our<00:03:25.920> timer<00:03:26.250> into<00:03:26.880> one<00:03:27.150> of<00:03:27.270> the<00:03:27.360> not

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
we need our timer into one of the not

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:33.080 
we need our timer into one of the not
gates<00:03:27.780> and<00:03:28.940> then<00:03:29.940> our<00:03:30.950> in<00:03:31.950> out<00:03:32.160> mover<00:03:32.520> into<00:03:32.940> the

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
gates and then our in out mover into the

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.280 
gates and then our in out mover into the
other<00:03:33.360> not<00:03:33.780> gate<00:03:35.120> then<00:03:36.120> we<00:03:36.330> want<00:03:36.540> Li<00:03:36.690> not<00:03:37.020> gate

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
other not gate then we want Li not gate

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.590 
other not gate then we want Li not gate
that's<00:03:37.500> attached<00:03:37.830> to<00:03:37.860> the<00:03:38.100> timer<00:03:38.400> to<00:03:39.360> be<00:03:39.480> the

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
that's attached to the timer to be the

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.120 
that's attached to the timer to be the
activation<00:03:40.320> of<00:03:40.470> the<00:03:40.650> in<00:03:40.800> out<00:03:40.950> mover<00:03:42.980> next<00:03:43.980> up

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
activation of the in out mover next up

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:45.890 
activation of the in out mover next up
we're<00:03:44.310> going<00:03:44.400> to<00:03:44.490> create<00:03:44.730> some<00:03:45.030> drag<00:03:45.450> so

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
we're going to create some drag so

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.090 
we're going to create some drag so
there's<00:03:46.140> something<00:03:46.320> that<00:03:46.500> pulls<00:03:46.830> the

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
there's something that pulls the

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.500 
there's something that pulls the
character<00:03:47.460> down<00:03:47.580> even<00:03:48.060> when<00:03:48.180> your<00:03:48.330> wall

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
character down even when your wall

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.510 
character down even when your wall
running<00:03:48.720> so<00:03:49.530> we're<00:03:49.650> going<00:03:49.800> to<00:03:49.890> get<00:03:50.040> a<00:03:50.100> mover

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
running so we're going to get a mover

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:55.460 
running so we're going to get a mover
and<00:03:50.730> we're<00:03:51.630> going<00:03:51.840> to<00:03:51.960> set<00:03:52.200> this<00:03:52.350> mover<00:03:53.000> to<00:03:54.470> no

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
and we're going to set this mover to no

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.440 
and we're going to set this mover to no
left<00:03:55.770> and<00:03:55.920> right<00:03:56.040> speed<00:03:56.400> we<00:03:57.240> want

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
left and right speed we want

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.360 
left and right speed we want
acceleration<00:03:58.140> and<00:03:58.260> deceleration<00:03:58.350> up<00:03:58.980> to<00:03:59.130> full

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
acceleration and deceleration up to full

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.340 
acceleration and deceleration up to full
we<00:04:00.240> want<00:04:00.530> -<00:04:01.530> 1<00:04:01.830> maybe<00:04:02.300> -<00:04:03.300> nor<00:04:03.540> point<00:04:03.840> 5<00:04:04.050> but

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
we want - 1 maybe - nor point 5 but

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.210 
we want - 1 maybe - nor point 5 but
we'll<00:04:04.440> go<00:04:04.530> with<00:04:04.560> not<00:04:04.860> -1<00:04:05.700> for<00:04:05.880> now<00:04:06.800> then<00:04:07.800> we<00:04:08.070> are

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
we'll go with not -1 for now then we are

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:15.890 
we'll go with not -1 for now then we are
going<00:04:08.370> to<00:04:08.490> place<00:04:08.790> down<00:04:09.120> our<00:04:09.690> and<00:04:10.290> gate<00:04:14.900> then

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
going to place down our and gate then

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:26.310 
going to place down our and gate then
both<00:04:16.380> of<00:04:16.410> our<00:04:16.680> not<00:04:16.950> gates<00:04:17.280> into<00:04:17.670> the<00:04:18.299> and<00:04:18.570> gate

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:32.360 

and<00:04:28.290> then<00:04:29.290> our<00:04:29.530> and<00:04:29.770> gate<00:04:29.950> into<00:04:30.760> our<00:04:31.060> mover

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
and then our and gate into our mover

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.670 
and then our and gate into our mover
last<00:04:33.370> thing<00:04:33.670> to<00:04:33.820> do<00:04:34.000> is<00:04:34.210> now<00:04:34.540> to<00:04:34.600> set<00:04:35.320> up<00:04:35.500> a

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
last thing to do is now to set up a

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.120 
last thing to do is now to set up a
animation<00:04:36.570> best<00:04:37.570> way<00:04:37.720> to<00:04:37.750> do<00:04:38.020> this<00:04:38.200> is<00:04:38.470> pop<00:04:38.920> out

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
animation best way to do this is pop out

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:44.640 
animation best way to do this is pop out
a<00:04:39.160> sack<00:04:39.640> bot<00:04:42.600> now<00:04:43.600> we<00:04:43.660> can<00:04:43.990> play<00:04:44.290> around<00:04:44.410> with

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
a sack bot now we can play around with

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.200 
a sack bot now we can play around with
animation<00:04:45.190> so<00:04:45.340> we<00:04:45.460> get<00:04:45.610> our<00:04:45.730> animation

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
animation so we get our animation

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.450 
animation so we get our animation
Tweaker<00:04:46.630> we<00:04:47.320> pop<00:04:47.500> it<00:04:47.620> inside<00:04:47.890> the<00:04:48.040> sack<00:04:48.250> bot

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
Tweaker we pop it inside the sack bot

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:53.150 
Tweaker we pop it inside the sack bot
and<00:04:50.220> we<00:04:51.220> change<00:04:51.520> the<00:04:51.640> animation<00:04:51.760> so<00:04:52.600> we<00:04:52.720> find<00:04:52.960> a

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
and we change the animation so we find a

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.980 
and we change the animation so we find a
decent-looking<00:04:54.160> run<00:04:54.760> animation<00:04:55.180> I<00:04:55.540> quite

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:55.990 
decent-looking run animation I quite

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.760 
decent-looking run animation I quite
like<00:04:56.260> the<00:04:57.090> Marlin<00:04:58.090> randoms<00:04:58.600> running<00:04:59.530> fast

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
like the Marlin randoms running fast

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.610 
like the Marlin randoms running fast
animation<00:05:00.340> for<00:05:00.490> this<00:05:01.050> then<00:05:02.050> we<00:05:02.260> are<00:05:02.290> going<00:05:02.500> to

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
animation for this then we are going to

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.950 
animation for this then we are going to
change<00:05:02.830> the<00:05:03.010> angle<00:05:03.520> to<00:05:03.700> match<00:05:04.090> our<00:05:04.330> wall<00:05:04.600> so

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
change the angle to match our wall so

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.650 
change the angle to match our wall so
he's<00:05:05.080> running<00:05:05.200> backwards<00:05:05.860> in<00:05:06.010> this<00:05:06.190> one<00:05:06.660> and

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
he's running backwards in this one and

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:12.390 
he's running backwards in this one and
we<00:05:07.960> want<00:05:08.080> a<00:05:08.290> slight<00:05:08.620> tilt<00:05:10.320> this<00:05:11.320> to<00:05:12.040> me<00:05:12.190> looks

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
we want a slight tilt this to me looks

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.840 
we want a slight tilt this to me looks
perfect<00:05:13.620> then<00:05:14.620> we<00:05:14.890> are<00:05:15.010> going<00:05:15.190> to<00:05:15.370> place<00:05:15.580> this

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:15.850 
perfect then we are going to place this

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.770 
perfect then we are going to place this
into<00:05:16.180> our<00:05:16.450> controller<00:05:17.140> later<00:05:17.380> and<00:05:18.780> then

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:19.780 
into our controller later and then

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:28.410 
into our controller later and then
attach<00:05:20.200> the<00:05:20.500> and<00:05:20.740> gate<00:05:21.130> into<00:05:21.670> it<00:05:27.420> it's

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:28.420 
attach the and gate into it it's

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:30.270 
attach the and gate into it it's
important<00:05:28.990> to<00:05:29.080> note<00:05:29.320> that<00:05:29.350> this<00:05:29.770> ball<00:05:30.010> run

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:30.280 
important to note that this ball run

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.240 
important to note that this ball run
have<00:05:30.640> lonely<00:05:30.940> run<00:05:31.360> in<00:05:31.630> one<00:05:31.930> direction<00:05:32.250> there

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
have lonely run in one direction there

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:34.440 
have lonely run in one direction there
is<00:05:33.340> a<00:05:33.400> way<00:05:33.580> to<00:05:33.640> make<00:05:33.880> it<00:05:34.030> run<00:05:34.150> in<00:05:34.300> both

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:34.450 
is a way to make it run in both

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:36.390 
is a way to make it run in both
directions<00:05:34.920> but<00:05:35.920> that<00:05:36.070> would<00:05:36.190> need<00:05:36.340> a

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.400 
directions but that would need a

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.820 
directions but that would need a
separate<00:05:36.790> tutorial<00:05:37.290> so<00:05:38.290> now<00:05:38.410> we<00:05:38.470> can<00:05:38.650> test

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:38.830 
separate tutorial so now we can test

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.640 
separate tutorial so now we can test
this<00:05:39.010> one<00:05:39.250> as<00:05:39.910> you<00:05:39.970> can<00:05:40.060> see<00:05:40.180> we<00:05:40.300> run<00:05:40.420> along<00:05:40.720> the

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650 
this one as you can see we run along the

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:43.740 
this one as you can see we run along the
pool<00:05:41.890> down<00:05:42.190> and<00:05:42.430> both<00:05:42.730> the<00:05:42.910> jump<00:05:43.270> were<00:05:43.720> a

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.750 
pool down and both the jump were a

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:47.100 
pool down and both the jump were a
little<00:05:44.020> bit<00:05:44.400> lacking<00:05:45.450> so<00:05:46.450> we<00:05:46.570> want<00:05:46.750> a<00:05:46.900> bit

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.110 
little bit lacking so we want a bit

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.290 
little bit lacking so we want a bit
higher<00:05:47.440> up<00:05:47.800> and<00:05:48.100> down<00:05:48.250> speed<00:05:48.580> on<00:05:48.700> the<00:05:48.790> jump<00:05:49.060> so

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:49.300 
higher up and down speed on the jump so

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.890 
higher up and down speed on the jump so
5<00:05:49.660> and<00:05:50.100> that's<00:05:51.100> it<00:05:51.370> well<00:05:52.180> thanks<00:05:52.690> for<00:05:52.780> watching
