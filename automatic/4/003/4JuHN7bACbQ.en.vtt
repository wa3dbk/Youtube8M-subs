00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
using this make touching this stuff make

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.660 
using this make touching this stuff make
sure<00:04:16.910> you<00:04:17.209> have<00:04:17.450> touched<00:04:17.900> like<00:04:18.170> a<00:04:18.440> metal<00:04:19.280> table

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:19.670 
sure you have touched like a metal table

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:21.520 
sure you have touched like a metal table
or<00:04:19.760> something<00:04:20.239> and<00:04:20.540> you<00:04:20.630> got<00:04:20.660> no<00:04:20.930> static<00:04:21.380> on

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
or something and you got no static on

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.950 
or something and you got no static on
you<00:04:21.650> or<00:04:21.859> you<00:04:22.340> could<00:04:22.550> break<00:04:22.760> it<00:04:22.790> so<00:04:23.180> there<00:04:23.840> it

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
you or you could break it so there it

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.000 
you or you could break it so there it
might<00:04:24.110> okay<00:04:25.040> take<00:04:25.580> the<00:04:25.730> slump<00:04:26.030> off<00:04:26.210> first<00:04:27.010> okay

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
might okay take the slump off first okay

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:33.790 
might okay take the slump off first okay
so<00:04:28.580> usually<00:04:31.030> you<00:04:32.030> push<00:04:32.390> in<00:04:32.660> on<00:04:32.900> these<00:04:33.440> things

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800 
so usually you push in on these things

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.270 
so usually you push in on these things
here<00:04:34.160> and<00:04:34.600> the<00:04:35.600> front<00:04:35.780> pot<00:04:36.110> should<00:04:36.800> pop<00:04:37.070> off

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
here and the front pot should pop off

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.070 
here and the front pot should pop off
and<00:04:37.780> there<00:04:38.780> should<00:04:39.020> be<00:04:39.050> one<00:04:39.169> on<00:04:39.500> each<00:04:39.650> side<00:04:39.940> and

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.080 
and there should be one on each side and

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:48.880 
and there should be one on each side and
let's<00:04:42.080> see<00:04:43.540> yeah<00:04:47.230> take<00:04:48.230> your<00:04:48.260> time<00:04:48.620> you<00:04:48.830> don't
