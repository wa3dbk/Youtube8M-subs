iphone and to me both models looks very
very<00:00:17.039> good<00:00:17.279> it's<00:00:17.789> very<00:00:18.180> hard<00:00:18.570> to<00:00:18.690> decide<00:00:19.170> which

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
very good it's very hard to decide which

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.160 
very good it's very hard to decide which
one<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:20.010> buy<00:00:20.130> really<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:21.359> it's<00:00:21.630> kind<00:00:21.869> of<00:00:21.960> cool

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
one to buy really and it's kind of cool

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.220 
one to buy really and it's kind of cool
that<00:00:22.199> they<00:00:22.619> look<00:00:22.949> like<00:00:23.279> all<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.600> leaks<00:00:24.810> of<00:00:25.109> the

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
that they look like all the leaks of the

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.710 
that they look like all the leaks of the
prototypes<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.070> dummy<00:00:26.670> iPhones<00:00:27.390> we<00:00:27.599> have

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
prototypes and dummy iPhones we have

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.370 
prototypes and dummy iPhones we have
seen<00:00:27.930> so<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:29.640> rumors<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.599> leaks<00:00:30.750> was<00:00:31.050> true

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
seen so the rumors and leaks was true

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.650 
seen so the rumors and leaks was true
here<00:00:32.099> we<00:00:32.219> can<00:00:32.399> see<00:00:32.550> how<00:00:32.759> much<00:00:33.030> bigger<00:00:33.390> the

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
here we can see how much bigger the

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.979 
here we can see how much bigger the
iphone<00:00:34.140> 6<00:00:34.350> plus<00:00:34.500> is<00:00:34.980> compared<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:36.059> normal

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
iphone 6 plus is compared to the normal

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.080 
iphone 6 plus is compared to the normal
iphone<00:00:37.260> 6<00:00:38.420> it's<00:00:39.420> huge<00:00:40.070> it's<00:00:41.070> only<00:00:41.340> six<00:00:41.790> point

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
iphone 6 it's huge it's only six point

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.200 
iphone 6 it's huge it's only six point
nine<00:00:42.180> millimeter<00:00:43.020> thick<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:44.399> 4.7<00:00:44.910> inch

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
nine millimeter thick the 4.7 inch

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.240 
nine millimeter thick the 4.7 inch
version<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.809> that<00:00:47.300> 5.5<00:00:48.300> inch<00:00:48.510> version<00:00:48.690> is<00:00:49.250> 7.1

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
version and that 5.5 inch version is 7.1

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.150 
version and that 5.5 inch version is 7.1
millimeter<00:00:50.879> thick<00:00:51.480> so<00:00:51.840> they<00:00:52.440> are<00:00:52.500> very<00:00:52.590> very

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
millimeter thick so they are very very

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.500 
millimeter thick so they are very very
thin<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:54.320> that<00:00:55.320> is<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.770> reason<00:00:55.800> why<00:00:56.489> it<00:00:57.180> now

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
thin and that is the reason why it now

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.830 
thin and that is the reason why it now
has<00:00:57.809> a<00:00:57.840> protruding<00:00:58.800> camera<00:00:58.829> so<00:00:59.550> that's<00:00:59.940> a<00:01:00.270> bit

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
has a protruding camera so that's a bit

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.560 
has a protruding camera so that's a bit
bad<00:01:01.109> here<00:01:01.859> we<00:01:02.010> can<00:01:02.129> see<00:01:02.190> some<00:01:02.550> design<00:01:03.000> details

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
bad here we can see some design details

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.890 
bad here we can see some design details
of<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.960> Space<00:01:04.320> Gray<00:01:04.769> version<00:01:05.460> as<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:06.570> can<00:01:06.720> see

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
of the Space Gray version as you can see

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.719 
of the Space Gray version as you can see
it<00:01:07.229> has<00:01:07.409> those<00:01:07.820> antennae<00:01:08.820> lines<00:01:10.130> I'm<00:01:11.130> down

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
it has those antennae lines I'm down

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.370 
it has those antennae lines I'm down
here<00:01:11.760> you<00:01:12.090> can<00:01:12.270> see<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:12.659> I'm<00:01:12.960> telling<00:01:13.320> our

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
here you can see that I'm telling our

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.070 
here you can see that I'm telling our
lives<00:01:13.590> on<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.920> back<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.640> phone<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:15.180> don't

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
lives on the back of the phone I don't

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.260 
lives on the back of the phone I don't
think<00:01:16.380> they<00:01:16.799> look<00:01:17.040> so<00:01:17.310> good<00:01:17.610> on<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.909> Space

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
think they look so good on the Space

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.890 
think they look so good on the Space
Gray<00:01:18.659> version<00:01:19.380> I<00:01:19.560> think<00:01:20.100> they<00:01:20.280> are<00:01:20.400> too

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
Gray version I think they are too

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.100 
Gray version I think they are too
obvious<00:01:21.900> on<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.520> space<00:01:23.520> clear<00:01:23.759> ocean<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.390> don't

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
obvious on the space clear ocean I don't

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.160 
obvious on the space clear ocean I don't
like<00:01:25.170> that<00:01:25.530> I<00:01:25.770> would<00:01:26.520> rather<00:01:26.670> have<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.869> lines

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
like that I would rather have the lines

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.660 
like that I would rather have the lines
in<00:01:28.560> another<00:01:29.250> color<00:01:29.579> more<00:01:30.450> like<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:31.670> backplate

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
in another color more like the backplate

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.740 
in another color more like the backplate
color<00:01:33.150> of<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.689> space<00:01:33.990> of<00:01:34.229> space<00:01:34.829> grey<00:01:35.040> version

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
color of the space of space grey version

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.230 
color of the space of space grey version
so<00:01:36.750> that's<00:01:37.020> a<00:01:37.170> bit<00:01:37.350> bad<00:01:37.799> but<00:01:38.640> if<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:38.880> look<00:01:39.030> at

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
so that's a bit bad but if you look at

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.440 
so that's a bit bad but if you look at
the<00:01:39.329> details<00:01:39.869> here<00:01:39.930> so<00:01:40.890> good<00:01:41.670> look<00:01:42.180> at<00:01:42.360> the

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
the details here so good look at the

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.520 
the details here so good look at the
bill<00:01:42.750> call<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:43.439> looks<00:01:43.829> so<00:01:44.250> great<00:01:45.290> this<00:01:46.290> is

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
bill call it it looks so great this is

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.270 
bill call it it looks so great this is
Apple<00:01:47.130> they<00:01:48.090> can<00:01:48.299> do<00:01:48.540> such<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.170> great<00:01:49.740> build

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
Apple they can do such a great build

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.999 
Apple they can do such a great build
quality<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.899> new<00:01:52.079> displays<00:01:52.590> has<00:01:52.979> a

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
quality and the new displays has a

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.670 
quality and the new displays has a
higher<00:01:53.549> resolution<00:01:54.079> it<00:01:55.079> is<00:01:55.640> 30<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:56.850> 40<00:01:57.149> for<00:01:57.180> x

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
higher resolution it is 30 and 40 for x

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.200 
higher resolution it is 30 and 40 for x
750<00:01:58.680> on<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:59.130> smaller<00:01:59.729> iPhone<00:02:00.540> 6<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:02.060> 1920<00:02:03.060> x

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
750 on the smaller iPhone 6 and 1920 x

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.980 
750 on the smaller iPhone 6 and 1920 x
1080<00:02:03.810> on<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.380> iphone<00:02:05.310> 6<00:02:05.490> plus<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:06.180> 5.5<00:02:06.750> inch

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
1080 on the iphone 6 plus the 5.5 inch

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.710 
1080 on the iphone 6 plus the 5.5 inch
so<00:02:07.799> it<00:02:08.310> has<00:02:08.520> a<00:02:08.550> higher<00:02:08.940> resolution<00:02:09.360> than

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
so it has a higher resolution than

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.450 
so it has a higher resolution than
before<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:11.280> ppi<00:02:11.790> is<00:02:11.910> much<00:02:12.420> higher<00:02:12.690> on<00:02:13.080> the

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
before and the ppi is much higher on the

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.450 
before and the ppi is much higher on the
5.5<00:02:14.460> inch<00:02:14.730> than<00:02:15.120> it<00:02:15.270> is<00:02:15.420> on<00:02:15.630> the<00:02:15.840> smaller<00:02:16.500> 4.7

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
5.5 inch than it is on the smaller 4.7

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.700 
5.5 inch than it is on the smaller 4.7
inch<00:02:17.610> and<00:02:17.900> here<00:02:18.900> you<00:02:19.020> can<00:02:19.140> see<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.350> silver

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
inch and here you can see the silver

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.210 
inch and here you can see the silver
version<00:02:20.120> 10<00:02:21.120> 10<00:02:21.420> Airlines<00:02:21.810> looks<00:02:22.470> much<00:02:22.950> better

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:59.170 
recording you can do full HD thousand
ATP<00:02:53.640> in<00:02:54.080> 60fps<00:02:55.080> or<00:02:55.650> slow<00:02:56.430> motion<00:02:57.030> at<00:02:57.740> 240<00:02:58.740> FPS

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.860 
ATP in 60fps or slow motion at 240 FPS
that's<00:03:00.180> really<00:03:01.020> slow<00:03:01.380> so<00:03:02.480> this<00:03:03.480> is<00:03:03.660> pretty

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
that's really slow so this is pretty

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.390 
that's really slow so this is pretty
nifty<00:03:04.140> and<00:03:05.300> you<00:03:06.300> can<00:03:06.540> now<00:03:07.140> also<00:03:07.530> use<00:03:07.980> time

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
nifty and you can now also use time

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.140 
nifty and you can now also use time
lapse<00:03:08.760> video<00:03:09.120> mode<00:03:09.540> and<00:03:10.310> time<00:03:11.310> lapse<00:03:11.610> is<00:03:11.940> not

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
lapse video mode and time lapse is not

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.260 
lapse video mode and time lapse is not
the<00:03:12.300> same<00:03:12.450> as<00:03:12.660> hyperlapse<00:03:13.290> but<00:03:13.710> i<00:03:14.210> think<00:03:15.210> that

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
the same as hyperlapse but i think that

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:17.740 
the same as hyperlapse but i think that
time-lapse<00:03:15.990> feature<00:03:16.830> could<00:03:17.250> be<00:03:17.370> very<00:03:17.580> useful

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
time-lapse feature could be very useful

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.350 
time-lapse feature could be very useful
directly<00:03:18.750> in<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:19.080> iphone<00:03:19.740> camera<00:03:20.040> and<00:03:20.459> you

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
directly in the iphone camera and you

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.250 
directly in the iphone camera and you
can<00:03:21.540> also<00:03:21.750> now<00:03:22.020> use<00:03:22.260> the<00:03:22.560> iphone<00:03:23.220> 6<00:03:23.490> as<00:03:23.880> a

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
can also now use the iphone 6 as a

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.840 
can also now use the iphone 6 as a
wallet<00:03:25.260> you<00:03:25.620> can<00:03:25.830> pay<00:03:26.070> directly<00:03:26.640> with<00:03:26.820> your

wallet you can pay directly with your

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.270 
wallet you can pay directly with your
phone<00:03:27.209> but<00:03:27.959> this<00:03:28.170> feature<00:03:28.530> is<00:03:28.740> only<00:03:29.070> available

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
with my experience I know that it will

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.280 
with my experience I know that it will
take<00:03:40.830> a<00:03:40.860> very<00:03:41.010> very<00:03:41.400> long<00:03:41.730> time<00:03:41.790> before<00:03:42.360> we

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
too bad here you can see the protruding

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
happy with because it will be very

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.250

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
understand why Apple did it because they

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.500 
understand why Apple did it because they
