00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
 them out and this is a this is a

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.830 
 them out and this is a this is a
zoom<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:50.689> 60<00:01:51.689> turbo<00:01:52.409> diesel<00:01:52.829> but<00:01:53.100> I<00:01:53.310> guess<00:01:53.840> he

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
zoom and 60 turbo diesel but I guess he

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.749 
zoom and 60 turbo diesel but I guess he
dumped<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.200> clutch<00:01:55.439> that<00:01:55.770> many<00:01:56.009> times<00:01:56.310> any
