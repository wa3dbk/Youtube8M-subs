00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.550
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.870
GIRL: Hi, Rojo!

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.130
WOMAN: My husband
lost his job.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.900
He worked for a company for 14
years, and with this declining

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.695
economy, he was let go.

00:00:19.695 --> 00:00:23.110
To this day, we are still trying
to make ends meet.

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:28.540
And unfortunately, food is
something that hasn't been so

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.590
much of an abundance for us.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.800
It's just really hard, because
our children want something to

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.400
eat, or something to drink,
or something.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:39.190
And it's hard because the
refrigerator is empty.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:40.440
There's nothing in there.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.820
MAN: When the money came up
really short, and the

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.020
cupboards were bare and there
wasn't a whole lot in the

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.965
fridge, and I knew that having
two small children, we needed

00:00:54.965 --> 00:00:56.050
to do something.

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.460
WOMAN: Because we met income
guidelines of being in need,

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.470
we went and applied
for food stamps.

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.080
Also, we're eligible for WIC.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.590
MAN: It's a program that gives
you the necessities for

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.060
growing children up until
five years old.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.062
WOMAN: It is hard when you see
you're running low, and you

00:01:16.062 --> 00:01:19.710
have kids to feed.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.839
The food pantry that I go to
makes you feel like you can

00:01:22.839 --> 00:01:23.950
feed your family.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.640
WOMAN: All righty,
that one's ready!

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.320
WOMAN: My grandson, Timothy,
notices, sometimes, the hard

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.060
times when there's certain
things that he asks me at the

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.290
grocery store that he would like
to have, and I have to

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.130
tell him, no.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.980
WOMAN: If I could recommend
anything to a family going

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:46.330
through a similar situation,
would be just don't be afraid

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:47.580
to ask for help.

00:01:52.697 --> 00:01:53.184
ELMO: Oh, hi!

00:01:53.184 --> 00:01:54.645
Welcome to Sesame Street!

00:01:54.645 --> 00:01:55.630
Who are you?

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.680
HAMBURGER BUN: We're
the super foods!

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.180
CHEESE: We're healthy foods!

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.630
BROCCOLI: Who are also heroes!

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.790
BANANA: And help
those in need!

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:03.790
ELMO: Oh, good!

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.760
Because Elmo needs help figuring
out what this is!

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:07.860
BROCCOLI: That's a Kiwi!

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:08.653
ELMO: A kiwi?

00:02:08.653 --> 00:02:09.639
CHEESE: Yes!

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:11.611
ELMO: Hm.

00:02:11.611 --> 00:02:12.104
Oh!

00:02:12.104 --> 00:02:12.597
Wow!

00:02:12.597 --> 00:02:13.583
That's cool!

00:02:13.583 --> 00:02:15.062
SUPER GROVER: Wow!

00:02:15.062 --> 00:02:18.020
ELMO: Elmo never ate
a kiwi before.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.006
Elmo likes it!

00:02:19.006 --> 00:02:20.180
ALL: Yay!

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.146
[SINGING]

00:02:21.146 --> 00:02:23.561
Elmo tried it, tried it.

00:02:23.561 --> 00:02:23.883
ELMO: [SINGING]

00:02:23.883 --> 00:02:25.493
And Elmo really liked it!

00:02:25.493 --> 00:02:27.425
And Elmo promises that--

00:02:27.425 --> 00:02:27.747
ALL: [SINGING]

00:02:27.747 --> 00:02:29.357
Try, try, again!

00:02:29.357 --> 00:02:31.772
ELMO: Elmo really loves Kiwi!

00:02:31.772 --> 00:02:33.730
Thank you!

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.810
ART SMITH: Hi everyone, I'm Chef
Art Smith, and we're at

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.210
the Chicago Green City Market
where everything's local and

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.310
fresh and delicious.

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.410
Your mom's grilled chicken is
going to make four meals.

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.950
Beautiful!

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.440
That's amazing

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.960
WOMAN: It's very important to
eat healthy, because what you

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.410
put into your body now is
going to determine where

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.590
you're going to be 20, 30,
40 years from now.
