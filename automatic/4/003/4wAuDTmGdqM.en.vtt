00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.160 

so<00:00:00.179> I<00:00:00.210> thought<00:00:00.359> I'd<00:00:00.480> document<00:00:00.840> my<00:00:00.900> first

00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:01.170 
so I thought I'd document my first

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:03.050 
so I thought I'd document my first
attempts<00:00:01.560> at<00:00:01.740> a<00:00:01.770> tilt<00:00:02.280> shift<00:00:02.370> lens<00:00:02.639> actually

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
attempts at a tilt shift lens actually

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.849 
attempts at a tilt shift lens actually
just<00:00:03.389> a<00:00:03.480> tilt<00:00:04.170> lens<00:00:04.350> because<00:00:04.589> there's<00:00:04.740> no

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
just a tilt lens because there's no

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.059 
just a tilt lens because there's no
shifting<00:00:05.250> capability<00:00:05.879> my<00:00:06.839> gh2<00:00:07.259> to<00:00:07.859> which<00:00:07.980> I

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
shifting capability my gh2 to which I

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.299 
shifting capability my gh2 to which I
want<00:00:08.280> to<00:00:08.340> attach<00:00:08.550> this<00:00:08.849> tilt<00:00:09.809> lens<00:00:10.050> so<00:00:10.950> I<00:00:10.980> start

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
want to attach this tilt lens so I start

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.480 
want to attach this tilt lens so I start
with<00:00:11.460> a<00:00:11.759> body<00:00:12.630> cap<00:00:12.960> which<00:00:13.290> I<00:00:13.590> drilled<00:00:13.950> out<00:00:14.160> the

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
with a body cap which I drilled out the

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.599 
with a body cap which I drilled out the
center<00:00:15.360> section<00:00:15.540> said<00:00:16.470> I'll<00:00:16.650> attach<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.400> lens

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
center section said I'll attach the lens

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.700 
center section said I'll attach the lens
to<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:17.910> camera<00:00:18.770> next<00:00:19.770> I've<00:00:20.250> got<00:00:21.680> when<00:00:22.680> I

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
to the camera next I've got when I

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.200 
to the camera next I've got when I
ordered<00:00:23.100> some<00:00:23.900> micro<00:00:24.900> four-thirds<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:26.060> m42

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
ordered some micro four-thirds to m42

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.200 
ordered some micro four-thirds to m42
adapters<00:00:28.019> from<00:00:28.470> Hong<00:00:28.680> Kong<00:00:28.710> I<00:00:29.250> was<00:00:29.849> given<00:00:30.119> an

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
adapters from Hong Kong I was given an

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.810 
adapters from Hong Kong I was given an
option<00:00:30.390> whereby<00:00:30.869> I<00:00:31.019> could<00:00:31.289> get<00:00:31.410> extra<00:00:32.009> sets<00:00:32.669> of

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
option whereby I could get extra sets of

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.819 
option whereby I could get extra sets of
these<00:00:32.940> basically<00:00:33.300> this<00:00:33.480> atom<00:00:33.840> for<00:00:34.500> detour

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
these basically this atom for detour

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.280 
these basically this atom for detour
it's<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.100> micro<00:00:35.489> four-thirds<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:36.290> anything

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
it's a micro four-thirds to anything

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.869 
it's a micro four-thirds to anything
adapter<00:00:37.860> they<00:00:38.070> have<00:00:38.280> these<00:00:38.399> little<00:00:38.520> rings

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
adapter they have these little rings

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.670 
adapter they have these little rings
that<00:00:39.660> fit<00:00:39.870> in<00:00:39.960> and<00:00:40.110> there's<00:00:40.230> some<00:00:40.350> little<00:00:40.469> set

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
that fit in and there's some little set

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.250 
that fit in and there's some little set
screws<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.160> keep<00:00:41.190> them<00:00:41.399> in<00:00:41.520> place<00:00:41.899> so<00:00:42.899> I've<00:00:43.079> got

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
screws to keep them in place so I've got

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.420 
screws to keep them in place so I've got
extras<00:00:43.620> of<00:00:43.680> these<00:00:43.860> because<00:00:44.070> you<00:00:44.160> never<00:00:44.250> know

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
extras of these because you never know

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.920 
extras of these because you never know
when<00:00:44.550> they're<00:00:44.640> gonna<00:00:44.700> come<00:00:44.879> in<00:00:44.969> handy<00:00:45.120> so<00:00:45.809> with

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
when they're gonna come in handy so with

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.200 
when they're gonna come in handy so with
this<00:00:45.989> project<00:00:46.170> we<00:00:46.440> don't<00:00:46.530> need<00:00:46.739> that<00:00:46.890> bit<00:00:47.210> but

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
this project we don't need that bit but

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.520 
this project we don't need that bit but
I<00:00:48.239> used<00:00:48.450> one<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.719> extra<00:00:48.989> ones<00:00:49.140> of<00:00:49.230> this<00:00:49.379> and

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
I used one the extra ones of this and

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.740 
I used one the extra ones of this and
this<00:00:49.590> basically<00:00:49.920> threads<00:00:50.280> on<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:51.300> m42

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
this basically threads on to and m42

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.150 
this basically threads on to and m42
lens<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:52.530> can<00:00:52.649> see<00:00:52.800> it's<00:00:52.920> got<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.100> little

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
lens and you can see it's got a little

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.299 
lens and you can see it's got a little
bit<00:00:53.640> of<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.789> divot<00:00:54.320> around<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.500> outside<00:00:56.160> edge

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
bit of a divot around the outside edge

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.660 
bit of a divot around the outside edge
there<00:00:56.579> so<00:00:57.410> that<00:00:58.410> attaches<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.160> lens<00:00:59.340> that

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
there so that attaches to the lens that

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.279 
there so that attaches to the lens that
attaches<00:00:59.910> to<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.210> body<00:01:00.390> now<00:01:00.719> all<00:01:00.870> we<00:01:00.960> need<00:01:01.109> is

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
attaches to the body now all we need is

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.770 
attaches to the body now all we need is
the<00:01:01.440> shift<00:01:01.680> mechanism<00:01:02.180> so<00:01:03.180> I<00:01:03.239> rated<00:01:03.539> my

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
the shift mechanism so I rated my

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.750 
the shift mechanism so I rated my
plumbing<00:01:04.049> bits<00:01:04.379> I<00:01:04.619> took<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.460> little<00:01:05.549> bit<00:01:05.670> of

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
plumbing bits I took a little bit of

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.370 
plumbing bits I took a little bit of
2-inch<00:01:06.210> ABS<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:07.409> cut<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:07.799> as<00:01:08.010> such<00:01:08.280> so<00:01:09.030> it's

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
2-inch ABS and cut it as such so it's

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.840 
2-inch ABS and cut it as such so it's
about<00:01:10.380> half<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.830> height<00:01:10.979> on<00:01:11.250> one<00:01:11.460> side<00:01:11.700> the

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
about half the height on one side the

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.210 
about half the height on one side the
other<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.240> whole<00:01:12.360> thing<00:01:12.630> as<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:13.220> whole

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
other and the whole thing as a whole

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.880 
other and the whole thing as a whole
that's<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.490> little<00:01:14.670> bit<00:01:15.619> 5/8<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:16.710> an<00:01:16.830> inch

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
that's a little bit 5/8 of an inch

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.570 
that's a little bit 5/8 of an inch
something<00:01:17.759> like<00:01:17.909> that<00:01:18.890> this<00:01:19.890> is<00:01:20.100> an<00:01:20.250> ABS

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
something like that this is an ABS

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.289 
something like that this is an ABS
coupler<00:01:21.210> 2<00:01:21.390> inch<00:01:21.570> 2<00:01:21.840> inch<00:01:22.369> which<00:01:23.369> I<00:01:23.490> cut<00:01:23.790> just

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
coupler 2 inch 2 inch which I cut just

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.230 
coupler 2 inch 2 inch which I cut just
off<00:01:24.570> half<00:01:24.900> so<00:01:25.680> that<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.920> centre<00:01:26.430> Ridge<00:01:26.670> is

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
off half so that the centre Ridge is

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.780 
off half so that the centre Ridge is
still<00:01:27.540> present<00:01:27.920> at<00:01:28.920> least<00:01:29.070> in<00:01:29.280> this<00:01:29.400> half<00:01:29.610> and

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
still present at least in this half and

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.190 
still present at least in this half and
then<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:29.939> cut<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.150> through<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.659> made<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:30.990> little

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
then I cut it through and made a little

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:39.950 
then I cut it through and made a little
notch<00:01:31.320> such<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:33.000> these<00:01:33.299> fit<00:01:33.689> together

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.620 

and<00:01:40.130> this<00:01:41.130> allows<00:01:41.370> me<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.760> adjust<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.450> length

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
and this allows me to adjust the length

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.650 
and this allows me to adjust the length
a<00:01:42.900> little<00:01:42.990> bit<00:01:43.230> sort<00:01:43.620> of<00:01:43.650> get<00:01:43.830> so<00:01:44.670> that<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.000> the

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.660 
a little bit sort of get so that the the

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.440 
a little bit sort of get so that the the
focal<00:01:46.020> plane<00:01:46.110> is<00:01:46.380> in<00:01:46.500> roughly<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.830> right<00:01:46.980> spot

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
focal plane is in roughly the right spot

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.030 
focal plane is in roughly the right spot
it<00:01:48.450> so<00:01:48.690> happens<00:01:49.050> that<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.230> body<00:01:49.410> cap<00:01:49.710> fits

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
it so happens that the body cap fits

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.300 
it so happens that the body cap fits
just<00:01:50.310> inside<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.910> 2<00:01:51.210> inch<00:01:51.420> abs<00:01:52.220> just<00:01:53.220> a

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
just inside the 2 inch abs just a

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.580 
just inside the 2 inch abs just a
friction<00:01:53.490> fit<00:01:53.670> like<00:01:54.030> that<00:01:54.180> now<00:01:55.110> if<00:01:55.229> I<00:01:55.320> redo

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
friction fit like that now if I redo

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.820 
friction fit like that now if I redo
this<00:01:55.740> I<00:01:55.920> might<00:01:56.100> I<00:01:56.130> have<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.960> micro<00:01:57.960> 4/3<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.590> see

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
this I might I have a micro 4/3 to see

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.190 
this I might I have a micro 4/3 to see
mount<00:01:59.040> adapter<00:01:59.160> which<00:02:00.030> I<00:02:00.150> might<00:02:00.330> flat<00:02:00.630> flush

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
mount adapter which I might flat flush

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.920 
mount adapter which I might flat flush
mount<00:02:01.440> here<00:02:01.770> just<00:02:02.700> because<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:03.119> body<00:02:03.630> caps

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
mount here just because the body caps

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.230 
mount here just because the body caps
don't<00:02:04.229> really<00:02:04.440> have<00:02:04.619> a<00:02:04.650> lot<00:02:04.920> of<00:02:05.060> strength<00:02:06.060> to

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
don't really have a lot of strength to

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.850 
don't really have a lot of strength to
them<00:02:06.390> so<00:02:06.570> I'd<00:02:06.690> be<00:02:06.840> happier<00:02:07.200> with<00:02:07.320> an<00:02:07.470> actual

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
them so I'd be happier with an actual

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.090 
them so I'd be happier with an actual
metal<00:02:07.920> piece<00:02:08.369> in<00:02:08.520> there<00:02:09.530> then<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.709> accommodate

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:11.100 
metal piece in there then to accommodate

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.040 
metal piece in there then to accommodate
the<00:02:11.220> tilt<00:02:11.989> we<00:02:12.989> put<00:02:13.200> this<00:02:13.350> in<00:02:13.530> place<00:02:13.680> here<00:02:15.050> and

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
the tilt we put this in place here and

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.930 
the tilt we put this in place here and
just<00:02:16.500> basically<00:02:16.770> in<00:02:16.950> between<00:02:16.980> two<00:02:17.430> screws<00:02:17.790> at

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
just basically in between two screws at

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.000 
just basically in between two screws at
the<00:02:18.000> moment<00:02:18.330> once<00:02:19.320> again<00:02:19.560> something<00:02:19.770> I<00:02:19.890> could

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
the moment once again something I could

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.190 
the moment once again something I could
give<00:02:20.130> me<00:02:20.220> a<00:02:20.250> little<00:02:20.370> bit<00:02:20.489> more<00:02:20.870> durable<00:02:21.870> on

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
give me a little bit more durable on

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.970 
give me a little bit more durable on
take<00:02:22.860> two<00:02:23.120> and<00:02:24.350> basically<00:02:25.350> this<00:02:25.530> is<00:02:25.590> just<00:02:25.860> the

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
take two and basically this is just the

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.620 
take two and basically this is just the
point<00:02:26.489> of<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.700> screw<00:02:26.850> this<00:02:27.720> is<00:02:27.930> inside<00:02:28.410> that

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
point of the screw this is inside that

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.930 
point of the screw this is inside that
not<00:02:30.630> on<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:31.590> actual<00:02:31.770> adapter<00:02:32.310> set<00:02:32.640> screws

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
not on the actual adapter set screws

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:49.699 
not on the actual adapter set screws
that<00:02:33.060> hold<00:02:33.239> it<00:02:33.330> in<00:02:33.390> place<00:02:48.110> and<00:02:49.110> that<00:02:49.170> allows<00:02:49.680> it

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
that hold it in place and that allows it

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.520 
that hold it in place and that allows it
to<00:02:49.920> tilt<00:02:50.540> and<00:02:51.540> you<00:02:51.630> can<00:02:51.750> see<00:02:51.900> why<00:02:52.080> all<00:02:52.110> of<00:02:52.320> these

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
to tilt and you can see why all of these

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.110 
to tilt and you can see why all of these
pieces<00:02:52.830> were<00:02:53.070> notched<00:02:53.280> out<00:02:53.549> because<00:02:53.880> if<00:02:54.000> it

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
pieces were notched out because if it

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.449 
pieces were notched out because if it
weren't<00:02:54.930> notched<00:02:55.110> out<00:02:55.350> and<00:02:56.040> I<00:02:56.100> wouldn't<00:02:56.310> have

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
weren't notched out and I wouldn't have

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.960 
weren't notched out and I wouldn't have
anywhere<00:02:56.700> to<00:02:56.760> go<00:02:57.890> ok<00:02:58.890> now<00:02:59.040> all<00:02:59.160> I<00:02:59.310> do<00:02:59.459> is<00:02:59.790> that<00:02:59.910> I

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
anywhere to go ok now all I do is that I

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.370 
anywhere to go ok now all I do is that I
have<00:03:00.269> a<00:03:00.380> 50<00:03:01.380> millimeter<00:03:01.739> lens<00:03:01.860> here<00:03:02.340> I<00:03:03.380> learned

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
have a 50 millimeter lens here I learned

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.720 
have a 50 millimeter lens here I learned
on<00:03:04.590> a<00:03:04.620> originally<00:03:05.370> a<00:03:05.400> film<00:03:05.760> SLR<00:03:06.920> back<00:03:07.920> I<00:03:08.220> guess

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
on a originally a film SLR back I guess

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.050 
on a originally a film SLR back I guess
15<00:03:09.209> 16<00:03:09.870> years<00:03:10.049> ago<00:03:10.489> so<00:03:11.489> I<00:03:11.519> had<00:03:11.670> these<00:03:11.820> lens

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
15 16 years ago so I had these lens

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.490 
15 16 years ago so I had these lens
leftover<00:03:12.600> which<00:03:12.720> is<00:03:12.840> why<00:03:12.989> I<00:03:13.019> was<00:03:13.140> going<00:03:13.350> after

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
leftover which is why I was going after

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.470 
leftover which is why I was going after
and<00:03:14.400> 42<00:03:15.000> adapters<00:03:15.450> in<00:03:15.510> the<00:03:15.600> first<00:03:15.780> place<00:03:17.480> so

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
and 42 adapters in the first place so

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.270 
and 42 adapters in the first place so
that<00:03:18.510> screws<00:03:18.840> on<00:03:18.959> there<00:03:19.110> but<00:03:19.380> polarizing<00:03:20.130> ones

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
that screws on there but polarizing ones

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.590 
that screws on there but polarizing ones
on<00:03:20.400> there<00:03:20.519> right<00:03:20.610> now<00:03:20.670> that's<00:03:21.060> so<00:03:21.239> important

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
on there right now that's so important

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.770 
on there right now that's so important
so<00:03:22.320> you<00:03:22.380> can<00:03:22.500> see<00:03:22.650> the<00:03:22.799> fat<00:03:23.010> allows<00:03:23.570> the<00:03:24.570> lens

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
so you can see the fat allows the lens

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:33.590 
so you can see the fat allows the lens
to<00:03:26.329> tilt<00:03:27.440> off<00:03:28.440> the<00:03:28.650> plane<00:03:29.900> there<00:03:31.790> okay<00:03:32.790> now<00:03:33.030> one

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
to tilt off the plane there okay now one

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.630 
to tilt off the plane there okay now one
last<00:03:33.840> thing<00:03:34.079> you<00:03:35.070> can<00:03:35.130> see<00:03:35.340> there's<00:03:35.519> little

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
last thing you can see there's little

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.900 
last thing you can see there's little
bits<00:03:35.850> of<00:03:36.530> light<00:03:37.530> can<00:03:37.860> sneak<00:03:38.190> in<00:03:38.340> here<00:03:38.670> I've<00:03:38.880> had

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
bits of light can sneak in here I've had

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.060 
bits of light can sneak in here I've had
some<00:03:39.329> success<00:03:39.510> just<00:03:39.930> sort<00:03:40.650> of<00:03:40.680> cupping<00:03:40.980> my

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
some success just sort of cupping my

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.650 
some success just sort of cupping my
hand<00:03:41.340> over<00:03:41.579> top<00:03:41.790> but<00:03:42.090> that's<00:03:42.180> not<00:03:42.360> really<00:03:42.570> the

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
hand over top but that's not really the

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.920 
hand over top but that's not really the
best<00:03:42.840> option<00:03:43.130> so<00:03:44.130> my<00:03:44.730> other<00:03:44.820> tutorial<00:03:45.570> so<00:03:45.720> far

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
best option so my other tutorial so far

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.349 
best option so my other tutorial so far
has<00:03:46.110> been<00:03:46.140> on<00:03:46.459> making<00:03:47.459> a<00:03:47.519> dead<00:03:47.700> cat<00:03:47.970> for<00:03:48.329> my

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:48.359 
has been on making a dead cat for my

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:51.319 
has been on making a dead cat for my
zoom<00:03:48.750> h1<00:03:49.280> and<00:03:50.280> basically<00:03:50.639> out<00:03:50.790> of<00:03:50.880> a<00:03:50.970> pair<00:03:51.269> of

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
zoom h1 and basically out of a pair of

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:53.540 
zoom h1 and basically out of a pair of
gloves<00:03:51.660> that<00:03:51.870> I<00:03:51.989> got<00:03:52.139> a<00:03:52.169> dollar<00:03:52.440> store

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
gloves that I got a dollar store

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.220 
gloves that I got a dollar store
however<00:03:54.000> I<00:03:54.060> had<00:03:54.150> a<00:03:54.180> second<00:03:54.510> glove<00:03:54.660> available

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
however I had a second glove available

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.550 
however I had a second glove available
so<00:03:55.800> what<00:03:55.890> I<00:03:55.920> did<00:03:56.040> I<00:03:56.280> just<00:03:56.460> cut<00:03:56.670> off<00:03:56.700> the<00:03:57.030> fingers

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
so what I did I just cut off the fingers

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:05.440 
so what I did I just cut off the fingers
and<00:04:03.110> that<00:04:04.110> sort<00:04:04.350> of<00:04:04.440> fits<00:04:04.620> it<00:04:04.800> fits<00:04:04.830> over<00:04:05.070> there

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
and that sort of fits it fits over there

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.760 
and that sort of fits it fits over there
still<00:04:06.450> giving<00:04:06.690> me<00:04:06.810> access<00:04:07.110> to<00:04:07.350> focus<00:04:08.450> and

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:09.770 
still giving me access to focus and

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:14.930 
still giving me access to focus and
keeps<00:04:10.770> out<00:04:10.950> extraneous<00:04:11.670> light<00:04:13.070> okay<00:04:14.070> and<00:04:14.850> then

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
keeps out extraneous light okay and then

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:21.380 
keeps out extraneous light okay and then
basically<00:04:15.330> just<00:04:18.890> go<00:04:19.890> in<00:04:20.010> there<00:04:20.190> and<00:04:20.400> that

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
basically just go in there and that

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.170 
basically just go in there and that
allows<00:04:21.600> you<00:04:21.810> to<00:04:22.130> tilt<00:04:23.130> the<00:04:23.250> lens<00:04:23.280> off<00:04:23.700> axis

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
allows you to tilt the lens off axis

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.740 
allows you to tilt the lens off axis
with<00:04:24.840> the<00:04:24.870> gh2<00:04:26.150> and<00:04:27.150> what<00:04:27.330> can<00:04:27.480> you<00:04:27.540> do<00:04:27.630> with

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
with the gh2 and what can you do with

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.230 
with the gh2 and what can you do with
this<00:04:27.980> well<00:04:28.980> basically<00:04:29.250> what<00:04:29.730> you<00:04:29.820> can<00:04:29.940> do<00:04:30.090> is

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
this well basically what you can do is

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.640 
this well basically what you can do is
make<00:04:30.480> things<00:04:30.720> that<00:04:30.930> are<00:04:31.050> supposed<00:04:31.470> to<00:04:31.560> be

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
make things that are supposed to be

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.950 
make things that are supposed to be
normal<00:04:32.040> size<00:04:32.370> look<00:04:33.180> like<00:04:33.360> they're<00:04:33.510> miniatures

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
normal size look like they're miniatures

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.050 
normal size look like they're miniatures
I've<00:04:34.830> done<00:04:35.010> this<00:04:35.100> before<00:04:35.280> with<00:04:35.520> photography

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
I've done this before with photography

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.330 
I've done this before with photography
just<00:04:36.210> taking<00:04:36.510> a<00:04:36.570> standard<00:04:37.200> picture<00:04:37.410> and<00:04:37.710> then

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
just taking a standard picture and then

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.250 
just taking a standard picture and then
mucking<00:04:39.090> about<00:04:39.150> in<00:04:39.300> photoshopped<00:04:39.930> you<00:04:40.140> can

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
mucking about in photoshopped you can

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.230 
mucking about in photoshopped you can
sort<00:04:40.410> of<00:04:40.440> give<00:04:40.560> that<00:04:40.590> illusion<00:04:41.120> but<00:04:42.120> that

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
sort of give that illusion but that

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.940 
sort of give that illusion but that
doesn't<00:04:42.450> work<00:04:42.540> so<00:04:42.690> well<00:04:42.810> with<00:04:42.930> videos<00:04:43.260> so<00:04:43.620> I

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:43.950 
doesn't work so well with videos so I

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:45.320 
doesn't work so well with videos so I
suppose<00:04:44.670> you<00:04:44.760> can<00:04:44.910> do<00:04:44.970> it<00:04:45.060> with<00:04:45.150> a<00:04:45.210> lot<00:04:45.300> of

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
suppose you can do it with a lot of

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.950 
suppose you can do it with a lot of
filters<00:04:45.690> so<00:04:46.820> instead<00:04:47.820> I've<00:04:47.970> decided<00:04:48.270> to<00:04:48.390> make

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:48.960 
filters so instead I've decided to make

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.440 
filters so instead I've decided to make
myself<00:04:49.140> a<00:04:49.380> little<00:04:49.410> tilt<00:04:49.800> lens<00:04:49.950> and<00:04:50.310> see<00:04:51.270> if<00:04:51.360> I

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.450 
myself a little tilt lens and see if I

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.430 
myself a little tilt lens and see if I
can't<00:04:51.660> take<00:04:51.870> some<00:04:52.080> miniaturized<00:04:52.950> video
