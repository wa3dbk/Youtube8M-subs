00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.980
 yes 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.520
 and 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:13.760
 for now it's swampy if by surprise 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:16.640
 nintendo 3ds has been updated and we have 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.110
 another version, the truth is that no 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.050
 I have no idea what that could not 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:22.520
 entering directly has led me to 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:24.830
 home menu and why are you watching these 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.980
 good things puts function designs the 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:30.169
 home menu added now you can save and 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.160
 use different configurations of 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:34.090
 menu 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.090
 let's give it to follow 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.720
 to take out your facet as an artist is that it's very 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:46.130
 late I do not give anymore and have fun creating your 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:51.070
 own designs of told me let's give it 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:51.070
 worth saving or loading design 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.130
 creating management data for the function 

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:01.630
 of home menu designs 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.630
 I'm going to give you I do not know 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:13.430
 OK 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.430
 I have stayed a little bit like you know 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.890
 to replaced 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.380
 they want to replace this menu 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.210
 customized with the current design of the 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.119
 home menu 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.640
 It's worth ok, but I'm already seeing the 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.409
 idea is worth 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.560
 we'll see 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:36.259
 this right now is this way I think 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:42.070
 which refers to the menu as we have 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:46.050
 putting the icons very well worth 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:49.030
 now for example I'm going to put 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:52.210
 this in another way 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:55.110
 I have it that way very well I'm going to close a 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.110
 moment the console 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:02.150
 How about guys how is the night going well? 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:06.350
 if it goes away we will enter it very well 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:10.390
 now we have this very well as we are going to 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:13.360
 put the things as well as it is 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.440
 I think it is already the pool 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.300
 idea 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.760
 at the beginning I stayed like saying 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.060
 I do not see it 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:24.560
 just so you can see that if I was 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.560
 exposed in different ways 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:35.040
 and I'm going to leave it like that 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.260
 very well we enter again in saving or 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.689
 load design 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.250
 and now I'm going to give him here and I'm going to 

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:48.910
 save this design very well 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.520
 perfect vale 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.190
 we have this perfect design yes it is good 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:55.960
 a little fair but very well then I 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.360
 I say okay but I liked the 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:03.660
 another then I give to save and load 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.660
 design and charge the design here 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.459
 we accept 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:16.090
 tikrit and the good angel we have already 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.550
 learned something because the truth is that not 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.940
 I have no idea if it includes more things or 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:23.280
 it's not worth thanks super you're a heaven of 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.560
 person 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:28.890
 Nothing is swamps here you see this 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:32.790
 new option that is save or load 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:35.790
 design so on the web we will put you 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.380
 what are the remains of things that he does 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.290
 if they have been told because the truth 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:44.430
 I was a bit surprised as you see 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:49.459
 in version 9 point 6.0 good bar a 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:53.310
 24 in america will be dash point 24 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:56.030
 and nothing, how nice 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.030
 I'm waiting 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:03.450
 let's have the design again, close one 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:07.580
 now 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.580
 not very good 6 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.780
 now I can load the other design is 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.470
 so that you understand a little the truth 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:18.579
 it does not have much 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:21.400
 if I'm going to load that there 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:23.830
 updating you see and now it's all 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.199
 menu then that way a little weird 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:29.920
 this is going well it seems that no but it is going well 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:32.680
 because I'm going to teach you one of my subjects 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.880
 since I put myself then I tell you what is the 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:39.510
 Grace 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:39.510
 a theme for example this 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:45.710
 the bus up in the soup good as 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:48.800

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:51.080
 see boom you see tick tick tick 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:54.230
 tick tick but of course if I have everything 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:56.090
 put me in the midst abu cover not 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:58.490
 is the grace then the thing would be 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:01.400
 put little icons and put them in the 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:03.800
 in the lower part there is the grace for 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.500
 that have added this option so that 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.450
 keep your menus and you can load 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.820

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:12.920
 it's one more option hey if you want to load 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.380
 from one bar to another easily 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:17.000
