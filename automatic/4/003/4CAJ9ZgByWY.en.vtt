 young people there and to the families of the incentive to the sport we created a bond

 communities with a sense of

 preservation 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.819
 in this space of the school they have a care 

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:53.359
 with this part of the equity 

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:55.970
 this is visible in careers and 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.000
 of the school itself you do not have to if the things clear that existed 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.080
 for more than a year here in this space you have nothing in space 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.040
 schools is located in a violent area of

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.530
 with themes such as environmental education 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:21.119
 the club and even with so many activities is faced with situations of divergence 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.240
 inside the school due to lack of space between friends and girlfriends 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.640
 nobody believes teacher 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.450
 this year we the film program with teenagers and that even happen 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.409
 within a scale that appears to be 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:36.560
 perfect the big difference is that here 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.970
 these conflicts are resolved at the base of the conversation 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:40.890
 we gave 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.950
 the wine 2009 january 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:43.870
 verdão 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.640
 its mini-course of social mediation within a project of the Ministry of 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.920
 justice of miami and citizenship 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.869
 then the principals watched 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.509
 thirty years participated 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:54.700
 and they liked it 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.759
 we wanted to know more about mediation 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.439
 and we have a project ready 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.910
 then directories when he was a tropical agent project 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.780
 the north consortium in são paulo maintained 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.770
 with the encouragement of the direction many students entered the group of 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.639
 mediators the first class 

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:16.729
 the first class were initiated and initially announced they must attend 

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:19.729
 already participated or even one more team 

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:24.989
 matter that already had a little difficulty wanting if you are invited 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:26.559
 to participate 

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:29.559
 and so we formed a class 

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:31.739
 what will be 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.079
 this for a year 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:35.919
 flavia beauty is responsible for the lessons 

00:02:35.919 --> 00:02:37.840
 in the first class she formed 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.500
 thirty mediators with the price of 100 dollars already this year were 40 students 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.349
 balance the actions so that the project can undertake teacher dedication 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:52.760
 Asphalt is happening here at school. They are a reflection of conflicts. 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.049
 that happen 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:57.149
 in são sebastião that cities then we have to learn 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:01.639
 How are you in the city? 

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:05.009
 and then just put it inside a neighborhood how do I most appreciate it 

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:08.470
 camila was mano however other states 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.080
 took the course of mediation and today helps colleagues and teachers 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.469
 to resolve small discussions 

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:18.229
 the question has changed 

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:22.279
 even because the students respect each other students and three teachers to whom 

00:03:22.279 --> 00:03:24.869
 There is more talk to the projection. 

00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:28.179
 the second talk of last year to talk 

00:03:28.179 --> 00:03:29.279
 the remaining 

00:03:29.279 --> 00:03:33.569
 the student's grades improved in relation to home as well 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:37.889
 China and India also formed in the first 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:41.209
 students the expectation is that this law does not exist any other too 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:44.879
 so from the moment we understand this relationship 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:48.489
 but it was also red with another 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:53.159
 I the conflicts they ask for more of themselves they help us to grow 

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:56.940
 the school has an estimated harvest capacity 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.689
 of mediation to the cancer yaw 

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:03.119
 mediators help the parties to come to an understanding 

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:05.689
 ripening 

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:07.399
 acceptance of differences 

00:04:07.399 --> 00:04:08.669
 participation 

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:12.719
 protagonism in the carnival community no one would have been injured 

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:17.949
 we are forming our young people are sebastião are wonderful 

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:20.949
 I can not say anything about these boys is that no school 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.509
 if we do not look a little dangerous the goods seized mediation and 

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:26.240
 technician 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.630
 the doctor but it was not time consuming and also to live with the relatives that is what 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.199
 matter is the heart 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:33.770
 leaders and thinkers 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.030
 but the relation of steel if we dedicate ourselves 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.050
 a new family would not have happened 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.879
 the boy who is busier 

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:41.199
 which has more benefits 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:42.630
 and this last canada 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.390
 aiming for a positive 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:48.189
 this week the negative leader and if that student works 

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:50.240
 it is 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.389
 and this is not a positive thing 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:54.000
 that has a legal deco 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.630
 school eliane 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.129
 still be a leader 

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:59.849
 and he change that posture 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:02.930
 is the goal of the school and was actually 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.729
 much of what happened with all the changes are small businesses 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:11.800
 the changes have been many and if they depend on the school they are francisco people each 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.460
 more prepared they will leave 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:19.980
 A man who looked like pains showing signs of inflammation was where I 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:23.279
 really feel very proud very happy 

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:24.629
 I actually feel 

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:26.520
 we finished champions 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.159
 because I think if we change this process of education seed the note 

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:31.870
 the entire unit 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:33.979
 out of people's relationship with anyone 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:39.180
 processes with themselves things like these cities with politics 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.870
 to help
