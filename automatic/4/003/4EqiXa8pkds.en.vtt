00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.449
 hello how about how are you welcome to the 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.210
 review of hungry video kinect 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.369
 adventures the inner langreo is a whole 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.440
 institution on the internet and in the world of 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.730
 the video games james rolfi created a 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.830
 character that in the long run has 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.989
 become a monster with videos 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:42.780
 highly acclaimed soon in a 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.089
 movie and now a video game and being 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.250
 that he is dedicated to playing garbage for 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:49.410
 entertain people today we 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.229
 It's up to us to be the judges of this 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.059
 adventure the game is very simple the 

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:55.890
 nerd gets caught in video came land 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.080
 where you have to go through nine levels 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.659
 that are replete with frustration in 8 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.640
 megaman-style bits you can choose 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:05.519
 the level you like without an order 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.020
 specific except for the final level and 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.729
 through this adventure you can 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.369
 it seems that the levels and the enemies 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.110
 they are totally random but the game lives 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.880
 by the references of the videos of the 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.880
 nerd and humor of the series since 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.580
 they form a large part of the environment and 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.860
 green earth plays very well on 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.350
 gameplay is excellent and very typical of the 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.190
 old school jump and shoot you can 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.500
 redirect 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.800
 different angles as well as special 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.530
 that are quite funny physics is 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.770
 the correct one but in effect one of the 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.250
 important factors is that it is a game 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.860
 unforgivable 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.630
 you will die left and right but not 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.360
 necessarily because it is not played well 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.120
 on the contrary the game is a sabotage 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.490
 total and you will cry blood around the 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.590
 levels the fights voices on the other hand 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.480
 they are not so complicated and in fact they are 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.760
 something generic but in itself it is appreciated 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.350
 that we have different voices pait and that 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.080
 in fact they remind us of different things 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.640
 typical nerd another detail which is very 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.950
 important is that you can choose 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.300
 different characters to play once 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.890
 that you discover them within the game 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.530
 simply by pressing a button 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.450
 you can make the change the good thing here is 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.250
 that are characters that we already know and 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.680
 everyone has a different skill 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.260
 that can serve you in the long run and I say 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.150
 long because they are not indispensable in themselves 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.210
 only to find one or the other 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:27.090
 secret but not to pass the game the 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:29.010
 graphics are very good it looks and it 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.770
 feels like an old school game 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.790
 in fact to the degree that you say that well 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.409
 programmed is 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.060
 unlike other sites rollers that 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:38.129
 we played in the past 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.719
 the nerd character design pulls me out 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:42.299
 a laugh every time I see his face 

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:44.939
 constant annoyance and the designs of the 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:46.500
 enemies characters and cameos are faithful 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:49.860
 to their counterparts in real life 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:52.350
 they did a great job in art 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.870
 music on the other hand we can say 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.330
 which is brutally great and listen to the 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.050
 werner issue in this glory has 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.050
 price 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:07.510
 gamer adventures is a video game based 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.390
 in a friend who makes YouTube videos 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:13.209
 about stinky games and watching it from 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.520
 there is already an achievement because the game is not 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.560
 Free is in steam and costs 15 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.380
 dollars and apart it sells very well 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.209
 indeed they manage to create the experience the 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:24.550
 detail is that the experience of 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:27.880
 nerd is to hate a game because of the bad 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:30.640
 is and achieves some of that since it is very 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.769
 annoyed at times because the challenge is not 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.410
 just on some occasions and you finish 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:37.630
 screaming with anger against your control and 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.480
 I return to the same thing if there is something great in 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:43.060
 this game is that cause that causes you the 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:45.489
 nerd fury but not everything is good 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.560
 here the game despite its excellent 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:49.930
 graphics has many flat designs and 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.180
 boring some levels just do not 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.730
 they have nothing special and knowing the 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.160
 show you know I can have designs on the 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.410
 different or richer fund in 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.330
 content show you the lack of 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.400
 opportunity for developers and 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.320
 I also think that it influences that James does not 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.720
 was directly involved with the 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:09.600
 development of it 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.300
 the cameos and references are very good 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.760
 I took you happy memories has everything 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.920
 has from its beers to peak set 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.989
 going through a hate phrase every 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.910
 you die is very funny that 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.800
 constantly the nerd complains that 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.440
 the game is hateful but in many 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.420
 senses the game is not so funny anymore 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.280
 that the only source of this fun 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:32.130
 are the references to the videos of 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.440
 nerd and if you do not know him or rather not what 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.840
 you know very well will be a game more 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.120
 simple and flat with a character 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.890
 pissed off in a few words is not the 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.500
 best way to present the nerd to 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:45.600
 other audiences where they do not know him anymore 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.820
 that you may not go from the game to 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.650
 difference that if you watch the videos and you 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:51.930
 whole that you have a game you're going to 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.760
 have to play it the truth is that the 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.580
 videogame was very important to review 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.200
 because the nerd is a marked influence 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.860
 in creating the content of many 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:03.750
 youtubers including threesome of strikeouts 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:05.880
 we see this game brings us a 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.580
 smile to the face since many of us dream 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.500
 to have an own game and despite 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.380
 have its bad details the game is 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:17.700
 good and I think it just remains 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:20.040
 ment to say can be much better 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.900
 game itself is not very long truth a 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.480
 good replayability with different 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.490
 difficulties I'm a nerd fan what 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.800
 I admire and it's a pleasure to make this review 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.600
 perhaps some doubt in acquiring it by 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.130
 the details that I mention but in what 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.140
 I feel very happy about 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.390
 have it in my collection since every 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:38.550
 the game comes to mind that is a 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:40.890
 celebration of making videos on youtube 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:44.370
 share tastes and make people laugh 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:46.680
 in a few words it's an honor to play it and 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.280
 be a victim of the phenomenon hungry video 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:52.800
 game night 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.800
 It lasts approximately 4 hours
