00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
slot an SD card slot right there to

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.440 
slot an SD card slot right there to
operate<00:01:37.010> around<00:01:37.160> there's<00:01:38.000> an<00:01:38.119> 8<00:01:38.270> megapixel

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
operate around there's an 8 megapixel

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:42.400 
operate around there's an 8 megapixel
BSI<00:01:39.350> sensor<00:01:39.640> camera<00:01:40.640> in<00:01:40.850> the<00:01:40.940> back<00:01:41.119> and<00:01:41.660> I

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:42.410 
BSI sensor camera in the back and I

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.859 
BSI sensor camera in the back and I
think<00:01:42.440> this<00:01:43.010> is<00:01:43.160> a<00:01:43.190> 2<00:01:43.430> megapixel<00:01:43.580> or<00:01:44.330> 1.3

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
think this is a 2 megapixel or 1.3

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.639 
think this is a 2 megapixel or 1.3
megapixel<00:01:45.440> camera<00:01:45.740> at<00:01:45.830> the<00:01:45.860> front<00:01:46.190> and<00:01:47.030> yet<00:01:47.649> so

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:48.649 
megapixel camera at the front and yet so

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:50.109 
megapixel camera at the front and yet so
it's<00:01:48.830> going<00:01:48.920> to<00:01:48.979> be<00:01:49.040> available<00:01:49.580> in<00:01:49.790> white<00:01:50.060> and
