this next section we're going to be

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.129 
this next section we're going to be
looking<00:00:08.309> at<00:00:08.670> the<00:00:08.849> tire<00:00:09.090> and<00:00:09.360> looking<00:00:09.780> at<00:00:09.929> the

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
looking at the tire and looking at the

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.169 
looking at the tire and looking at the
tread<00:00:10.410> wear<00:00:10.440> and<00:00:10.800> how<00:00:11.309> it<00:00:11.429> relates<00:00:11.790> to<00:00:11.910> the

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
tread wear and how it relates to the

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.259 
tread wear and how it relates to the
alignment<00:00:12.509> of<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:13.049> car<00:00:13.910> so<00:00:14.910> if<00:00:14.969> you<00:00:15.059> look<00:00:15.240> here

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
alignment of the car so if you look here

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.710 
alignment of the car so if you look here
you<00:00:15.719> can<00:00:15.750> see<00:00:16.080> a<00:00:16.230> pretty<00:00:16.529> new<00:00:16.710> tire<00:00:16.980> and<00:00:17.600> if<00:00:18.600> you

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
you can see a pretty new tire and if you

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.250 
you can see a pretty new tire and if you
take<00:00:18.930> note<00:00:20.359> inside<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.510> tire<00:00:21.720> that<00:00:22.140> are

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
take note inside the tire that are

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.250 
take note inside the tire that are
slightly<00:00:22.710> raised<00:00:23.609> bumps<00:00:24.210> both<00:00:24.689> in<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.900> center

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
slightly raised bumps both in the center

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.490 
slightly raised bumps both in the center
and<00:00:25.439> along<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.920> edge<00:00:26.070> of<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.670> tire<00:00:27.230> these<00:00:28.230> are

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
and along the edge of the tire these are

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.160 
and along the edge of the tire these are
the<00:00:28.619> tire<00:00:28.830> wear<00:00:29.220> marks<00:00:29.660> when<00:00:30.660> these<00:00:30.810> wear

marks are reached when the tire is worn
down<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.500> these<00:00:34.649> marks<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.610> tire<00:00:35.850> is<00:00:36.120> close<00:00:36.450> to

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
down to these marks the tire is close to

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.220 
down to these marks the tire is close to
needing<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.050> be<00:00:37.170> replaced<00:00:38.480> now<00:00:39.480> if<00:00:39.750> your<00:00:39.960> tire

penny and turn it upside down and put it
inside<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.670> tread<00:01:03.890> now<00:01:04.949> if<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.840> tread<00:01:07.110> is

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
inside the tread now if the tread is

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.440 
inside the tread now if the tread is
shallower<00:01:08.010> than<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.400> gap<00:01:08.580> from<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.119> edge<00:01:09.240> of

the penny the Abraham Lincoln's head the
tread<00:01:13.380> has<00:01:13.710> been<00:01:14.189> worn<00:01:14.460> down<00:01:14.610> too<00:01:14.909> much<00:01:15.090> and

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
tread has been worn down too much and

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.940 
tread has been worn down too much and
the<00:01:15.509> tire<00:01:15.720> probably<00:01:16.080> needs<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.530> be<00:01:16.650> replaced

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
the tire probably needs to be replaced

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.749 
the tire probably needs to be replaced
so<00:01:17.689> you<00:01:18.689> can<00:01:18.930> see<00:01:19.170> along<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.040> inside<00:01:20.430> of<00:01:20.610> this

so you can see along the inside of this

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.859 
so you can see along the inside of this
tire<00:01:21.950> that<00:01:22.950> some<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.460> tread<00:01:23.759> is<00:01:24.270> shallower

tire that some of the tread is shallower

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.469 
tire that some of the tread is shallower
than<00:01:25.259> this<00:01:25.439> gap<00:01:25.650> on<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.009> penny<00:01:26.220> but<00:01:27.180> towards

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
than this gap on the penny but towards

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.359 
than this gap on the penny but towards
the<00:01:27.570> center<00:01:27.840> of<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.110> tire<00:01:28.320> there's<00:01:29.070> still

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
the center of the tire there's still

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:35.870 
the center of the tire there's still
plenty<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.939> tread<00:01:30.780> left<00:01:33.680> so<00:01:34.680> if<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:34.950> see<00:01:35.189> where

tire with very little wear along the
inside<00:01:42.150> your<00:01:42.869> tire<00:01:43.110> may<00:01:43.560> be<00:01:43.619> under<00:01:44.070> inflated

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
inside your tire may be under inflated

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.740 
inside your tire may be under inflated
causing<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.659> inside<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.920> sink<00:01:47.700> or<00:01:47.909> be<00:01:48.540> pushed

causing the inside to sink or be pushed

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.889 
causing the inside to sink or be pushed
into<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.259> tire<00:01:49.460> now<00:01:50.460> if<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:51.090> only<00:01:51.270> see<00:01:51.570> wear

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
into the tire now if you only see wear

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.350 
into the tire now if you only see wear
or<00:01:52.140> heavy<00:01:52.770> wear<00:01:53.070> along<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.850> middle<00:01:54.149> of<00:01:54.270> the

tire but the outside of the tires are
relatively<00:01:57.509> unborn<00:01:58.020> your<00:01:58.619> tire<00:01:58.860> may<00:01:59.280> be

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
relatively unborn your tire may be

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.399 
relatively unborn your tire may be
overinflated<00:02:00.299> or<00:02:00.450> have<00:02:00.570> too<00:02:00.750> much<00:02:00.930> air<00:02:01.170> in<00:02:01.290> it

overinflated or have too much air in it

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.770 
overinflated or have too much air in it
so<00:02:02.009> you<00:02:02.520> may<00:02:02.670> need<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:02.939> adjust<00:02:03.060> your<00:02:03.450> tire

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
so you may need to adjust your tire

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.280 
so you may need to adjust your tire
