board<00:00:40.530> around<00:00:41.270> here<00:00:42.270> we<00:00:42.390> go<00:00:44.270> it's<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.329> bit<00:00:45.450> hard

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
board around here we go it's a bit hard

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.959 
board around here we go it's a bit hard
to<00:00:45.719> do<00:00:45.870> it<00:00:45.960> at<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.079> same<00:00:46.230> time<00:00:46.309> here<00:00:47.309> we<00:00:47.399> go<00:00:47.430> so

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
to do it at the same time here we go so

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.049 
to do it at the same time here we go so
we<00:00:48.149> can<00:00:48.300> see<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:49.530> LED<00:00:49.649> flashes<00:00:50.370> if<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.789> angle

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
we can see the LED flashes if the angle

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.389 
we can see the LED flashes if the angle
is<00:00:51.120> too<00:00:51.180> great<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:52.760> the<00:00:53.760> little<00:00:55.039> indicator<00:00:56.039> on

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
is too great and the little indicator on

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.049 
is too great and the little indicator on
the<00:00:56.520> screen<00:00:56.760> also<00:00:56.940> moves<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:58.789> show<00:00:59.789> you<00:00:59.850> the

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
the screen also moves to show you the

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.110 
the screen also moves to show you the
direction<00:01:00.629> that<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.809> board<00:01:01.020> is<00:01:01.140> facing<00:01:02.120> again

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
direction that the board is facing again

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.800 
direction that the board is facing again
we<00:01:03.270> can<00:01:03.420> see<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.780> raw<00:01:04.530> sense<00:01:04.890> of<00:01:05.100> data<00:01:05.689> so<00:01:06.689> this

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
we can see the raw sense of data so this

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.230 
we can see the raw sense of data so this
is<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.110> gyro<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.770> ACC<00:01:08.600> from<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.720> six<00:01:09.960> Oh

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
is the gyro and the ACC from the six Oh

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.929 
is the gyro and the ACC from the six Oh
from<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.420> mpu<00:01:12.930> 6000<00:01:13.680> being<00:01:14.400> displayed<00:01:14.760> on<00:01:14.880> the

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
from the mpu 6000 being displayed on the

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.090 
from the mpu 6000 being displayed on the
screen<00:01:15.150> there<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.540> values<00:01:16.409> seem<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.740> be<00:01:16.860> about

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
screen there the values seem to be about

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.690 
screen there the values seem to be about
right<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:18.830> here<00:01:19.830> we<00:01:19.979> can<00:01:20.100> see<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.430> receiver

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
right and here we can see the receiver

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.300 
right and here we can see the receiver
tab<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:22.259> can<00:01:22.290> see<00:01:22.439> me<00:01:22.740> waggling<00:01:23.159> the

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
tab and you can see me waggling the

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:29.420 
tab and you can see me waggling the
sticks<00:01:24.140> and<00:01:26.390> flipping<00:01:27.390> switches<00:01:27.720> on<00:01:28.430> eight

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
sticks and flipping switches on eight

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.910 
sticks and flipping switches on eight
channels<00:01:29.820> here<00:01:31.100> so<00:01:32.100> basically<00:01:33.560> this<00:01:34.560> little

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
channels here so basically this little

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.249 
channels here so basically this little
board<00:01:35.189> if<00:01:35.670> you<00:01:36.210> hook<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.570> up<00:01:36.720> using<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:39.259> six

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
board if you hook it up using the six

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.340 
board if you hook it up using the six
output<00:01:40.950> here<00:01:41.329> and<00:01:42.329> not<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.780> first<00:01:43.020> one<00:01:43.229> like

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
output here and not the first one like

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.100 
output here and not the first one like
you<00:01:43.500> would<00:01:43.619> normally<00:01:44.009> use<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:45.000> six<00:01:45.299> output<00:01:45.840> to

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
you would normally use the six output to

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.580 
you would normally use the six output to
the<00:01:46.259> ppm<00:01:47.220> output<00:01:47.850> of<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.420> receiver<00:01:49.290> and

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
the ppm output of the receiver and

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.280 
the ppm output of the receiver and
hookup<00:01:52.590> Howard<00:01:52.950> he<00:01:53.070> receiver<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:54.290> powder

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
hookup Howard he receiver and powder

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.770 
hookup Howard he receiver and powder
board<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:56.040> four<00:01:56.549> motors<00:01:56.939> on<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.090> first<00:01:57.420> four

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
board and four motors on the first four

board and four motors on the first four
output<00:01:58.290> pins<00:01:58.530> over<00:01:58.770> here<00:01:59.100> it<00:02:00.060> might<00:02:00.420> actually

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
output pins over here it might actually

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.520 
output pins over here it might actually
fly<00:02:01.820> if<00:02:02.820> you're<00:02:03.090> lucky<00:02:03.390> I'm<00:02:04.079> not<00:02:04.140> flight

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
fly if you're lucky I'm not flight

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.660 
fly if you're lucky I'm not flight
tested<00:02:04.860> it<00:02:04.920> yet<00:02:05.100> because<00:02:05.250> I've<00:02:05.430> only<00:02:05.549> just

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
tested it yet because I've only just

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.639 
tested it yet because I've only just
finished<00:02:05.880> coding<00:02:06.240> it<00:02:06.450> I<00:02:07.020> need<00:02:07.409> to<00:02:07.439> build

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
finished coding it I need to build

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:08.990 
finished coding it I need to build
another<00:02:07.890> quad<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.369> stick<00:02:08.580> this<00:02:08.700> in<00:02:08.879> or

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
another quad to stick this in or

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.470 
another quad to stick this in or
something<00:02:09.179> but<00:02:10.170> it<00:02:10.259> might<00:02:10.379> actually<00:02:10.530> fly<00:02:11.360> so

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
something but it might actually fly so

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.950 
something but it might actually fly so
who's<00:02:12.840> brave<00:02:13.080> enough<00:02:13.140> to<00:02:13.379> give<00:02:13.620> it<00:02:13.650> a<00:02:13.739> try
