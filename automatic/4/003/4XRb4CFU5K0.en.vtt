00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.089
 the beautiful geyser of this new video 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.220
 here on my channel we are on call of duty 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.139
 the advanced warfare before leaving 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.650
 wait until we throw everyone's voices 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.120
 because otherwise we no longer feel anything or 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.699
 perfect my headphones and cells or the 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.820
 sky pad let's not make ugly 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.140
 figure and bring you a nice game o 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.100
 beautiful first beautiful beautiful beautiful beautiful 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.510
 expect 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.949
 I saw it I saw it I saw it 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.090
 there was a movie there is one on the most 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.439
 beautiful 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.390
 there is someone who has saved your ass 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.450
 thank you, however, we have fallen 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.370
 so much in this in this game 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.640
 I don't know why he just came in first 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.410
 we were like 40 59 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.110
 oh well the register because it is almost 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.789
 finished obviously and we were full and then 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.110
 the lobby has probably been emptied 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.300
 I came in they said look at us 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.910
 give up a pro and let us go because 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.989
 if not here our rate or if it comes down 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.090
 as if there were no tomorrow 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:59.489
 obviously it will never be like this in life 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:01.920
 but having seen the but I wasn't there madonna 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.660
 what a fear I am I got myself 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.510
 attacked under gentlemen I have 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.549
 attached below are all there and I am 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.830
 coming out because I'm transgressing 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.869
 see if anyone is interested in 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.570
 die under my flight bullets or 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.610
 one day we no it is but because I 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.520
 reload when I miss three shots not 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.650
 I know if you've ever seen the image of that 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.200
 kind of got the heavy gunner with 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:30.240
 200 shots in the barrel shoots 1 and then 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:32.970
 all pissed off and out there are more 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.920
 or less so unfortunately this is it 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.990
 in this big problem I have to 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.860
 recharge like death because if not 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.360
 I 'm not fine with myself and so am I 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.030
 the square button we have a series 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.880
 very very turbulent relationship e 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.979
 really upset because I have it 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.390
 I press and he tells me not premier but not 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.280
 press weapons that you hurt yourself and 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.310
 punctually right though 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.960
 gentlemen you know I like doing me 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.119
 like to do my own thing 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.580
 then here the dead one if I thought 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.100
 It was a camper but no one has died 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:08.039
 check I know you are there 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.539
 from the anger I immediately immediately there was nothing 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.120
 we go because we don't want to go through 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:15.120
 the camper on duty, however, is there and playing 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.910
 there is a little slower and more tactical 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.680
 very much here then behind c parma sacra 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.080
 I don't work because I have only one 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.610
 I certainly had n't seen that if not 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.519
 I would have died 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.610
 then I did one last time 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:31.950
 question in which precisely to me 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.120
 I asked where you had this beautiful 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.880
 cod 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.709
 if you were on xbox playstation pecci 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.540
 etc. etc. and much less answered 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.280
 very many have told me that you have 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.600
 the play on playstation 4 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.160
 take everything I am very happy too 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.530
 because I have it too 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.200
 4 and therefore obviously if we want to do 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.600
 a lobby all together seems to me also 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.040
 quite feasible, however, I must warn you 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.140
 on the facebook page so I do 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.959
 I recommend you go away to register that the 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.489
 link is this description but today I want 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.049
 ask me another question because I am 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.209
 very curious today I was thinking 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.900
 while doing another game for i 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.209
 my dicks 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.860
 and I said that this way I don't have 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.680
 just used machine guns 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.360
 reading is just symmetries 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.220
 Tele Gen Grandparents Assault Rifles This is it 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.049
 an assault rifle and gentlemen e 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.440
 light dog tags that actually moles 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:21.390
 cod have always been my weapons 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.209
 favorite in quotes because they are 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:28.109
 the ones I used most in black ops 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:30.440
 now you have used the hood 47 u in black 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:33.739
 ops 2mo I don't remember which weapon I used 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:37.320
 I used mp 7 modern warfare 3 let's say that 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:39.299
 turning aside apart from some weird e 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.430
 particular exception 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:43.320
 I have always used machine guns and 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.290
 instead in this goal I'm not using 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:49.019
 only assault rifles and then the 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.850
 he asks that I want you to do one of those weapons 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.019
 prefer to use soccordo if you have 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.910
 of favorite weapons 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:57.150
 surely you will have gentlemen I did 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:59.850
 a triple randy mom my mom who 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.800
 what is it that makes my mum my lord 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.090
 look at that feed that field is 

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.120
 huge that never ends 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:09.360
 all made irena mori marì marì 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.909
 all my mammamia gentlemen but not that one 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.010
 it's nobody it was just water I thought 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:16.139
 was a guy with invisibility mom 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.419
 my my sight I have to wear glasses 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:20.220
 so mister and just tell me a 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:22.199
 here below in comments such as 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.850
 they are your favorite weapons 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:25.889
 if you like more use of sockets 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.020
 of assault, if anything, there is who I know that 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:29.970
 many of you adore the sniper I am 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.160
 completely denied that I already had 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:35.070
 assault rifles I don't know how he manages to 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.199
 fight I assure you with the sniper that 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.550
 I can shoot a shot every once in a while 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:39.810
 my death is assured of its own 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.360
 from the start of the game then 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.970
 I prefer to avoid like the plague 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.590
 reuse it mori mia mia no no no no 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.410
 no no no no no no no no we are 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:52.470
 treacherous damn damn lords 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:53.310
 we were making a beautiful one 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.470
 beautiful feed 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.570
 let's put this stuff here here 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:00.240
 we also call places call me places 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:02.280
 thank you they get something nice 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.900
 my friend what is it is tower is of 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.889
 proximity that I did not take because of me 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.960
 they killed 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:08.639
 shame on him shame or not 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:12.470
 to the proximity tower that in 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:14.580
 ass mom then here and I die gentlemen 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.740
 concentration when these happen 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.300
 things take concentration enough 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:22.260
 we lost the tower does nothing 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:24.570
 we are going to kill our enemies in 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:27.000
 some way back up in then 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:28.410
 how things are done if anything without making us 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:31.849
 see from the turrets they fucked 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:34.110
 he died, he died and died away , he adds 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:36.360
 let's get away from it 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:39.650
 same route as trying to 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:43.530
 not catching that was a kill of its own 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:45.599
 and damn me but no no no from behind 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:48.900
 at the echo, gentlemen take me from behind 

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:51.100
 it's not really nice I don't know if 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:53.620
 have you ever tried 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:55.390
 not even in the queue at least it is not 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:58.120
 properly sympathetic are not in 

00:05:55.390 --> 00:06:01.300
 reality as ok then stop all still 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:03.310
 all ahi ahi ahi to just see 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.320
 from behind it's just you should see me in 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:07.180
 this moment I am there 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:09.100
 just point the screen as if the 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:11.730
 enemy could actually me then 

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:14.740
 see everything I feel pretty 

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:17.860
 stupid he did not do things but then me 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:20.530
 I realize that it is part of me ahia ahia 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.820
 look at the back there but I mica 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:23.860
 I knew we could ask for the way 

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:26.740
 let's all go, let's go and see that 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:28.960
 dude back there the fuck is that friend 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:31.540
 I knew you could get them that 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:35.350
 show sign all made mathematicians 

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:39.040
 back up here, and however good or salts 

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:40.690
 yes child has perhaps discovered how the 

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:42.880
 madonna that is you have to go up don't get yourself 

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:45.340
 seeing becomes difficult becomes 

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:48.340
 complex is not very complex 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:50.530
 no one I would opt for below, here it is 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:53.110
 here I knew I did n't really feel it 

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:54.550
 I do not know gentlemen of the sixth sense also 

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:56.890
 the seventh is a knight of the 

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:59.140
 zodiac in here I saw someone 

00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:01.600
 is but from behind is always from behind 

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:03.700
 gentlemen we have lost that 

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:06.430
 Fantastic feed of villas I had 

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:09.430
 started doing and we have to go back to 

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:10.330
 play a little more more done with 

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:12.280
 papi in fact co 

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:14.290
 let's calm calm dogs we're done 

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:17.410
 but the game lost by one point 

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:20.500
 casserole a point when gentlemen 

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:22.600
 we did 20 14 but has the little game 

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.740
 it's not bad I have to tell the truth is not for 

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.550
 not bad 

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:26.920
 I went to see if I unlocked 

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:28.660
 a little bit but unfortunately no gentlemen 

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:30.550
 unlocked nothing but I take the opportunity 

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:32.740
 to show you my class that is 

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:35.170
 this one seen since last time me 

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:37.210
 I forgot to show it to you and 

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:40.360
 precisely I was sorry because it is if anything 

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:43.090
 you were curious, however, using hbr a tre 

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:45.010
 with these these because and these 

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:46.270
 accessories I find myself well every game 

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:48.250
 I do it too 

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:50.380
 so not bad though for the vases 

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:52.630
