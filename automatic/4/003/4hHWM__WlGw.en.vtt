00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
center of the screen it looks like a dot

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.030 
center of the screen it looks like a dot
looks<00:00:35.790> like<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.090> dot<00:00:36.450> but<00:00:36.870> it's<00:00:37.200> awfully<00:00:37.860> close

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
looks like a dot but it's awfully close

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.000 
looks like a dot but it's awfully close
I<00:00:38.430> mean<00:00:38.580> this<00:00:38.700> is<00:00:38.910> getting<00:00:39.270> scary<00:00:39.720> you<00:00:39.960> know

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010

I mean this is getting scary you know
these<00:00:41.010> asteroids<00:00:41.489> once<00:00:42.180> we<00:00:42.330> started<00:00:42.690> looking

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
these asteroids once we started looking

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.170 
these asteroids once we started looking
for<00:00:43.230> them<00:00:43.350> more<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:43.710> more<00:00:43.980> it's<00:00:44.640> almost<00:00:44.879> like

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
for them more and more it's almost like

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.759 
for them more and more it's almost like
maybe<00:00:45.449> we<00:00:45.720> shouldn't<00:00:45.960> have<00:00:46.080> started<00:00:46.290> looking

00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:46.769 
maybe we shouldn't have started looking

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:48.619 
maybe we shouldn't have started looking
it's<00:00:46.920> kind<00:00:47.129> of<00:00:47.190> like<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.370> Don't<00:00:47.699> Ask<00:00:47.879> Don't<00:00:48.330> Tell

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.170 
it's kind of like a Don't Ask Don't Tell
kind<00:00:49.379> of<00:00:49.559> thing<00:00:49.739> this<00:00:50.400> is<00:00:50.580> not<00:00:50.699> going<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:50.970> hit

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
kind of thing this is not going to hit

kind of thing this is not going to hit
the<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.690> earth<00:00:51.870> right<00:00:52.320> I<00:00:52.559> mean<00:00:52.710> this<00:00:52.830> is<00:00:53.040> just

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
the the earth right I mean this is just

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.850 
the the earth right I mean this is just
sort<00:00:53.489> of<00:00:53.550> another<00:00:54.239> wake-up<00:00:54.809> call<00:00:55.110> as<00:00:55.350> opposed

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
sort of another wake-up call as opposed

sort of another wake-up call as opposed
to<00:00:56.239> to<00:00:57.239> somebody<00:00:57.629> charging<00:00:58.260> right<00:00:58.890> quite

00:00:59.210 --> 00:00:59.220 
to to somebody charging right quite

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.490 
to to somebody charging right quite
right<00:00:59.250> Jeff<00:01:00.089> but<00:01:00.330> the<00:01:00.720> fact<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:01.049> it's<00:01:01.229> only<00:01:01.409> a

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
right Jeff but the fact that it's only a

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.469 
right Jeff but the fact that it's only a
few<00:01:01.739> lunar<00:01:02.159> diameters<00:01:02.760> way<00:01:03.000> that's<00:01:03.239> pretty

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:03.479 
few lunar diameters way that's pretty

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:05.690 
few lunar diameters way that's pretty
close<00:01:03.720> astronomically<00:01:04.680> I<00:01:04.739> mean<00:01:04.949> this<00:01:05.370> shows

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
close astronomically I mean this shows

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.210 
close astronomically I mean this shows
us<00:01:06.090> that<00:01:06.360> these<00:01:06.570> asteroids<00:01:07.170> are<00:01:07.500> especially

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
us that these asteroids are especially

us that these asteroids are especially
the<00:01:08.549> near-earth<00:01:09.020> asteroids<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:11.010> know

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
the near-earth asteroids you know

the near-earth asteroids you know
they're<00:01:11.340> everywhere<00:01:11.790> they're<00:01:11.970> like<00:01:12.090> deer

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
tick so those Hari Krishna people at

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.920 
tick so those Hari Krishna people at
airports<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:15.000> know<00:01:15.119> they're<00:01:15.299> there<00:01:15.540> you

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
airports you know they're there you

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.450 
airports you know they're there you
can't<00:01:16.200> get<00:01:16.350> away<00:01:16.440> from<00:01:16.560> them<00:01:16.890> now<00:01:17.070> that<00:01:17.310> we're

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
can't get away from them now that we're

as<00:02:37.570> you<00:02:37.780> guys<00:02:37.960> have<00:02:38.140> already<00:02:38.380> discussed<00:02:38.830> was

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
as you guys have already discussed was

telescope and in fact very recently I

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.120 
telescope and in fact very recently I
think<00:02:46.120> it<00:02:46.270> was<00:02:46.450> only<00:02:46.870> this<00:02:47.260> year<00:02:47.320> earlier<00:02:48.010> this

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
think it was only this year earlier this

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.520 
think it was only this year earlier this
year<00:02:48.190> that<00:02:48.610> same<00:02:49.209> telescope<00:02:49.750> has<00:02:49.930> been<00:02:50.200> used

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
year that same telescope has been used

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.479 
year that same telescope has been used
to<00:02:51.209> virtually<00:02:52.209> rule<00:02:52.600> out<00:02:52.959> the<00:02:53.620> existence<00:02:54.310> of

for very dark very cold objects and I

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:06.690 
for very dark very cold objects and I
employed<00:03:05.440> you<00:03:05.680> mean<00:03:05.860> it's<00:03:06.130> instead<00:03:06.580> of

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
employed you mean it's instead of

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.460 
employed you mean it's instead of
looking<00:03:06.820> for<00:03:07.180> a<00:03:07.209> light<00:03:07.390> it's<00:03:07.870> looking<00:03:08.260> for

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
looking for a light it's looking for

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.490 
looking for a light it's looking for
heat<00:03:09.360> yeah<00:03:10.360> it's<00:03:10.630> just<00:03:10.810> looking<00:03:11.080> for<00:03:11.290> lighter

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
heat yeah it's just looking for lighter

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.160 
heat yeah it's just looking for lighter
two<00:03:11.739> different<00:03:12.040> wavelengths<00:03:12.459> yes<00:03:13.330> actually<00:03:14.110> a

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
two different wavelengths yes actually a

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.199 
two different wavelengths yes actually a
lot<00:03:14.410> of<00:03:14.590> people<00:03:15.010> are<00:03:15.280> I<00:03:15.310> won't<00:03:15.640> say<00:03:15.790> confused

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
lot of people are I won't say confused

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.170 
lot of people are I won't say confused
about<00:03:16.480> a<00:03:16.630> Jeff<00:03:16.930> because<00:03:17.290> that<00:03:17.470> would<00:03:17.650> be<00:03:18.180> not

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
about a Jeff because that would be not

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.940 
about a Jeff because that would be not
fair<00:03:19.510> to<00:03:19.720> you<00:03:19.840> to<00:03:19.870> say<00:03:20.200> that<00:03:20.440> but<00:03:20.620> there<00:03:20.830> is

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
fair to you to say that but there is

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.530 
fair to you to say that but there is
actually<00:03:21.370> a<00:03:21.430> difference<00:03:21.760> between<00:03:22.150> infrared

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
actually a difference between infrared

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.350 
actually a difference between infrared
and<00:03:23.019> heat<00:03:23.350> and<00:03:23.650> it's<00:03:24.130> interesting<00:03:24.730> enough<00:03:25.060> to

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
and heat and it's interesting enough to

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.240 
and heat and it's interesting enough to
make<00:03:25.540> the<00:03:25.720> point<00:03:25.900> since<00:03:26.230> the<00:03:26.680> object<00:03:27.130> we're

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
make the point since the object we're

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.890 
make the point since the object we're
looking<00:03:27.489> at<00:03:27.610> right<00:03:27.640> now<00:03:27.850> is<00:03:28.360> discovered

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
looking at right now is discovered

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.170 
looking at right now is discovered
because<00:03:29.230> of<00:03:29.380> its<00:03:29.530> infrared<00:03:30.370> emissions

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
because of its infrared emissions

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.900 
because of its infrared emissions

what<00:03:42.250> it<00:03:42.400> does<00:03:42.670> when<00:03:43.030> infrared<00:03:43.540> waves<00:03:43.810> hit

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
what it does when infrared waves hit

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.550 
what it does when infrared waves hit
your<00:03:44.440> skin<00:03:44.920> it<00:03:45.730> makes<00:03:45.760> the<00:03:46.720> atoms<00:03:47.170> on<00:03:47.380> your

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
your skin it makes the atoms on your

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.490 
your skin it makes the atoms on your
skin<00:03:47.940> vibrate<00:03:48.940> or<00:03:49.180> move<00:03:49.540> and<00:03:49.870> it's<00:03:50.080> the<00:03:50.260> motion

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
skin vibrate or move and it's the motion

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.300 
skin vibrate or move and it's the motion
of<00:03:50.860> the<00:03:51.070> atoms<00:03:51.280> which<00:03:51.850> is<00:03:52.030> the<00:03:52.180> heat<00:03:53.250> so<00:03:54.250> it

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
of the atoms which is the heat so it

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.640 
of the atoms which is the heat so it
produces<00:03:54.670> heat<00:03:55.329> on<00:03:55.570> an<00:03:55.720> object<00:03:55.900> that<00:03:56.260> it<00:03:56.410> hits

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
produces heat on an object that it hits

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.259 
produces heat on an object that it hits
but<00:03:56.980> it's<00:03:57.070> not<00:03:57.250> heat<00:03:57.519> in<00:03:57.790> and<00:03:58.030> of<00:03:58.120> itself

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
but it's not heat in and of itself

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:00.690 
but it's not heat in and of itself
because<00:03:58.690> heat<00:03:59.200> is<00:03:59.380> the<00:03:59.680> simple

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700

impact this cataclysmic impact debris

00:06:27.879 --> 00:06:30.390 
impact this cataclysmic impact debris
was<00:06:28.030> hurled<00:06:28.360> out<00:06:28.689> and<00:06:29.050> that<00:06:29.229> really<00:06:29.500> teed<00:06:30.099> to

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:30.400 
was hurled out and that really teed to

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.149 
was hurled out and that really teed to
form<00:06:30.669> our<00:06:30.969> moon<00:06:31.719> and<00:06:32.020> what<00:06:32.860> we've<00:06:33.009> been

00:06:33.149 --> 00:06:33.159 
form our moon and what we've been

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:35.670 
form our moon and what we've been
looking<00:06:33.370> for<00:06:33.610> as<00:06:34.180> scientists<00:06:34.780> is<00:06:35.199> actually

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:35.680 
looking for as scientists is actually

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.830 
looking for as scientists is actually
the<00:06:35.800> chemical<00:06:36.280> fingerprints<00:06:37.180> of<00:06:37.360> fear<00:06:37.629> they

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:37.840 
the chemical fingerprints of fear they

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.749 
the chemical fingerprints of fear they
should<00:06:38.050> be<00:06:38.139> the<00:06:38.259> chemical<00:06:38.740> signature<00:06:39.340> of<00:06:39.490> thia

00:06:39.749 --> 00:06:39.759 
should be the chemical signature of thia

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:41.760 
should be the chemical signature of thia
in<00:06:39.969> the<00:06:40.509> moon<00:06:40.659> rocks<00:06:40.900> and<00:06:41.110> people<00:06:41.469> have<00:06:41.590> been

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:41.770 
in the moon rocks and people have been

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:43.679 
in the moon rocks and people have been
looking<00:06:41.889> for<00:06:42.099> this<00:06:42.280> for<00:06:42.340> a<00:06:42.550> long<00:06:42.610> time<00:06:42.759> and<00:06:43.270> the

00:06:43.679 --> 00:06:43.689 
looking for this for a long time and the

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:45.540 
looking for this for a long time and the
scientists<00:06:44.229> in<00:06:44.349> Germany<00:06:44.860> say<00:06:45.219> that<00:06:45.430> they

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:45.550 
scientists in Germany say that they

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:48.360 
scientists in Germany say that they
think<00:06:45.819> they<00:06:45.939> found<00:06:45.969> it<00:06:46.469> so<00:06:47.469> we<00:06:47.620> have<00:06:47.800> here<00:06:48.219> a

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:48.370 
think they found it so we have here a

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:51.570 
think they found it so we have here a
couple<00:06:49.029> of<00:06:49.479> meteorites<00:06:50.229> from<00:06:50.860> the<00:06:51.039> collection

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:51.580 
couple of meteorites from the collection

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:54.629 
couple of meteorites from the collection
this<00:06:52.150> first<00:06:52.449> one<00:06:52.870> which<00:06:53.469> is<00:06:53.500> a<00:06:53.680> small<00:06:54.219> slice<00:06:54.580> of

00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:54.639 
this first one which is a small slice of

00:06:54.639 --> 00:06:57.510 
this first one which is a small slice of
a<00:06:54.939> meteorite<00:06:55.449> is<00:06:55.779> actually<00:06:56.500> a<00:06:56.529> meteorite<00:06:57.039> from

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:57.520 
a meteorite is actually a meteorite from

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.589 
a meteorite is actually a meteorite from
the<00:06:57.759> moon<00:06:58.080> there's<00:06:59.080> about<00:06:59.259> 130<00:07:00.129> of<00:07:00.400> these

00:07:00.589 --> 00:07:00.599 
the moon there's about 130 of these

00:07:00.599 --> 00:07:03.510 
the moon there's about 130 of these
types<00:07:01.599> of<00:07:01.779> meteorite<00:07:02.259> known<00:07:02.500> on<00:07:02.680> earth<00:07:02.710> so

00:07:03.510 --> 00:07:03.520 
types of meteorite known on earth so

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.969 
types of meteorite known on earth so
it's<00:07:03.639> very<00:07:03.879> important<00:07:04.509> sample<00:07:05.409> because<00:07:05.590> even

00:07:05.969 --> 00:07:05.979 
it's very important sample because even

00:07:05.979 --> 00:07:08.040 
it's very important sample because even
studying<00:07:06.400> a<00:07:06.520> small<00:07:06.789> part<00:07:07.060> of<00:07:07.270> this<00:07:07.419> meteorite

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:08.050 
studying a small part of this meteorite

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:08.999 
studying a small part of this meteorite
will<00:07:08.289> actually<00:07:08.560> give<00:07:08.680> us<00:07:08.770> a<00:07:08.860> lot<00:07:08.979> of

00:07:08.999 --> 00:07:09.009 
will actually give us a lot of

00:07:09.009 --> 00:07:12.149 
will actually give us a lot of
information<00:07:09.669> about<00:07:10.150> the<00:07:10.779> the<00:07:11.379> composition<00:07:12.039> of

00:07:12.149 --> 00:07:12.159 
information about the the composition of

00:07:12.159 --> 00:07:14.700 
information about the the composition of
the<00:07:12.759> moon<00:07:12.939> and<00:07:13.180> it's<00:07:13.479> by<00:07:13.659> studying<00:07:14.080> moon<00:07:14.439> rocks

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:14.710 
the moon and it's by studying moon rocks

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:16.769 
the moon and it's by studying moon rocks
like<00:07:15.069> this<00:07:15.340> one<00:07:15.669> although<00:07:16.060> they<00:07:16.389> actually

00:07:16.769 --> 00:07:16.779 
like this one although they actually

00:07:16.779 --> 00:07:18.300 
like this one although they actually
scientists<00:07:17.349> actually<00:07:17.469> studied<00:07:17.919> Apollo

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:18.310 
scientists actually studied Apollo

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:21.390 
scientists actually studied Apollo
samples<00:07:18.990> by<00:07:19.990> studying<00:07:20.229> these<00:07:20.529> in<00:07:20.710> detail<00:07:20.889> and

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:21.400 
samples by studying these in detail and

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.519 
samples by studying these in detail and
looking<00:07:21.699> at<00:07:21.789> the<00:07:21.909> composition<00:07:22.539> of<00:07:22.690> oxygen<00:07:23.409> in

00:07:23.519 --> 00:07:23.529 
looking at the composition of oxygen in

00:07:23.529 --> 00:07:26.369 
looking at the composition of oxygen in
these<00:07:23.919> types<00:07:24.250> of<00:07:24.430> rocks<00:07:24.699> that<00:07:24.969> the<00:07:25.810> scientists

00:07:26.369 --> 00:07:26.379 
these types of rocks that the scientists

00:07:26.379 --> 00:07:28.019 
these types of rocks that the scientists
and<00:07:26.500> Germany<00:07:26.919> believe<00:07:27.250> that<00:07:27.460> they<00:07:27.550> have<00:07:27.580> found

00:07:28.019 --> 00:07:28.029 
and Germany believe that they have found

00:07:28.029 --> 00:07:29.899 
and Germany believe that they have found
the<00:07:28.210> chemical<00:07:28.599> fingerprints<00:07:29.229> of<00:07:29.379> the

the chemical fingerprints of the
impacting<00:07:30.909> fear<00:07:31.360> so<00:07:31.960> this<00:07:32.110> this<00:07:32.349> body<00:07:32.650> they're

00:07:32.909 --> 00:07:32.919 
impacting fear so this this body they're

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:34.800 
impacting fear so this this body they're
impacted<00:07:33.550> into<00:07:33.819> the<00:07:33.909> early<00:07:34.150> Earth<00:07:34.270> about

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:34.810 
impacted into the early Earth about

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:37.949 
impacted into the early Earth about
four-and-a-half<00:07:35.229> billion<00:07:35.589> years<00:07:35.710> ago
