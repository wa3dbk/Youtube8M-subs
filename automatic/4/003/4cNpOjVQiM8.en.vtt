00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 suspended mirror ceilings with their 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.580
 using and the surface can be easily 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.510
 align and room visually enlarge 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.269
 set this at first glance 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.809
 complex design can do all 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.320
 about everything will go one day for all outboard 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.020
 ceilings 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.730
 installation begins with markup 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.130
 remember do it wrong and 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.050
 the ceiling will turn skew marks 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.300
 we put only in one corner but should not 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.730
 be 2 here and here 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.140
 so it will be easier for us to set the level by 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.989
 the entire perimeter of the ceiling 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.110
 now we stretch the masking thread she 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.690
 sprinkled with pigments exhibited 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.860
 so that both tags match after that 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:47.039
 thread we pull up and let go perfectly 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.170
 straight line ready but if the walls 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.120
 lined with tiles so that 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.480
 meticulously do not have to die out 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.190
 just focusing on the seams 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.730
 Now these labels are fixed to the wall 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.010
 fringe 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:03.320
 this is an additional mount on it 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.320
 will draw the main guides 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.549
 the next step is measuring the distance for 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.950
 horizontal guides remember 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.290
 they should fit snugly to the walls 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.030
 literally end to end 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.979
 the ceiling once staggering mirrors 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.220
 then install the transverse guides 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.320
 all help or 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.020
 mosques under the mirror to the ceiling 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.960
 turned out to be sure to check 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.970
 each such guide corner they 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.630
 must be exactly 90 degrees 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:34.030
 now the structure is fixed to the ceiling 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.430
 do it in steps of about 60 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.430
 centimeters so it will be secure 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.320
 but not all mirrors will hold 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.810
 in any case will have to 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.970
 use halves cut mirror 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.490
 ordinary glass cutter but before that 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.940
 tool dunk in kerosene and then 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.470
 the weight will turn out perfect holes by 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.080
 fixtures made diamond crown 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.119
 when blood will be exactly left 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.869
 just insert the mirrors in the ceiling and 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:03.610
 connect lights 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.910
