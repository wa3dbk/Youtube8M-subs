circulate it you need all the parts that

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.179 
circulate it you need all the parts that
make<00:00:20.730> up<00:00:20.760> that<00:00:20.939> composite<00:00:21.710> to<00:00:22.710> be<00:00:22.830> working

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
make up that composite to be working

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.820 
make up that composite to be working
well<00:00:23.840> working<00:00:24.840> together<00:00:24.990> working<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.650> way

constriction any tightness you find
think<00:03:09.210> of<00:03:09.360> it<00:03:09.480> maybe<00:03:10.440> you<00:03:10.620> can<00:03:10.770> visualize<00:03:11.190> it

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:11.460 
think of it maybe you can visualize it

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.450 
think of it maybe you can visualize it
as<00:03:11.670> ice<00:03:12.180> dissolving<00:03:13.020> solid<00:03:13.770> turning<00:03:14.160> into<00:03:14.430> a

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
liquid and gas is going away what we

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.330 
liquid and gas is going away what we
want<00:03:17.430> to<00:03:17.520> do<00:03:17.640> is<00:03:17.820> teach<00:03:18.330> ourselves<00:03:18.510> and

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
want to do is teach ourselves and

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.740 
want to do is teach ourselves and
practice<00:03:20.340> get<00:03:20.520> better<00:03:20.760> at<00:03:21.000> progressively

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
practice get better at progressively
