board and all four wheels do pop up into

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.759 
board and all four wheels do pop up into
the<00:00:25.859> air<00:00:26.240> now<00:00:27.240> there's<00:00:27.599> one<00:00:27.930> little<00:00:28.349> piece<00:00:28.740> of

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
the air now there's one little piece of

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.500 
the air now there's one little piece of
this<00:00:29.099> that<00:00:29.310> you're<00:00:29.490> missing<00:00:29.970> or<00:00:30.090> having<00:00:30.420> a

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
hard time with and that's leveling out

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.030 
hard time with and that's leveling out
your<00:00:32.820> board<00:00:33.149> this<00:00:34.110> is<00:00:34.170> one<00:00:34.559> of<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.770> pieces

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
your board this is one of the pieces

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.490 
your board this is one of the pieces
that<00:00:35.250> it's<00:00:35.670> very<00:00:35.910> hard<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.570> explain<00:00:36.870> somebody

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
that it's very hard to explain somebody

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.100 
that it's very hard to explain somebody
how<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:37.800> do<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.629> way<00:00:39.660> that<00:00:39.960> I've<00:00:40.079> found

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
how to do it and the way that I've found

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.340 
how to do it and the way that I've found
best<00:00:40.680> is<00:00:40.980> kind<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:42.300> pay<00:00:42.629> close<00:00:43.170> attention

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
best is kind of to pay close attention

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.670 
best is kind of to pay close attention
to<00:00:43.739> your<00:00:43.920> knee<00:00:44.340> so<00:00:45.149> look<00:00:45.780> at<00:00:45.930> your<00:00:46.079> foot<00:00:46.379> it

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
to your knee so look at your foot it

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.590 
to your knee so look at your foot it
does<00:00:47.070> slide<00:00:47.370> up<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.730> board<00:00:48.000> it<00:00:48.180> does<00:00:48.360> pop

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
does slide up the board it does pop

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.690 
does slide up the board it does pop
everything<00:00:49.140> up<00:00:49.260> into<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.590> air<00:00:49.770> but<00:00:50.550> your

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
everything up into the air but your

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.959 
everything up into the air but your
board<00:00:51.000> is<00:00:51.270> very<00:00:51.539> gets<00:00:52.469> very<00:00:52.710> vertical<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.789> it

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
board is very gets very vertical and it

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.139 
board is very gets very vertical and it
never<00:00:54.180> goes<00:00:54.980> horizontal<00:00:55.980> again<00:00:56.219> what<00:00:56.879> I<00:00:56.910> mean

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
never goes horizontal again what I mean

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.090 
never goes horizontal again what I mean
by<00:00:57.300> that<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:57.870> pops<00:00:58.140> up<00:00:58.350> into<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.739> air<00:00:58.920> and

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
by that is it pops up into the air and

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.639 
by that is it pops up into the air and
it's<00:00:59.250> almost<00:00:59.579> straight<00:00:59.879> up<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.300> down<00:01:00.649> and

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
it's almost straight up and down and

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.399 
it's almost straight up and down and
what<00:01:01.770> you<00:01:01.949> want<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.340> to<00:01:02.489> do<00:01:02.640> is<00:01:02.910> pop<00:01:03.600> in<00:01:03.809> up<00:01:04.049> into

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
what you want it to do is pop in up into

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.410 
what you want it to do is pop in up into
the<00:01:04.500> air<00:01:04.650> going<00:01:05.309> straight<00:01:05.820> up<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.060> down<00:01:06.180> at

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
the air going straight up and down at

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.770 
the air going straight up and down at
first<00:01:06.750> but<00:01:07.470> then<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.860> level<00:01:08.340> out<00:01:08.610> so<00:01:09.330> it's<00:01:09.570> nice

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
first but then to level out so it's nice

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.730 
first but then to level out so it's nice
and<00:01:09.840> even<00:01:10.530> in<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.799> air<00:01:11.150> so<00:01:12.150> if<00:01:12.869> again<00:01:13.320> it's

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
and even in the air so if again it's

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.380 
and even in the air so if again it's
kind<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:14.010> hard<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.280> explain<00:01:14.460> this<00:01:14.939> step<00:01:15.210> to

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
kind of hard to explain this step to

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.539 
kind of hard to explain this step to
somebody<00:01:15.750> because<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.619> say<00:01:16.860> pop<00:01:17.310> with<00:01:17.520> your

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
somebody because you say pop with your

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.670 
somebody because you say pop with your
back<00:01:17.880> foot<00:01:18.150> drag<00:01:18.689> your<00:01:18.900> front<00:01:19.170> foot<00:01:19.380> up<00:01:19.409> the

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
back foot drag your front foot up the

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.890 
back foot drag your front foot up the
board<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:20.310> then<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.880> next<00:01:21.270> step<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.600> got<00:01:21.780> to

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
board and then the next step you got to

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.740 
board and then the next step you got to
do<00:01:22.020> is<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.320> kind<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:22.619> gotta<00:01:23.430> push<00:01:23.850> your<00:01:24.360> front

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
do is you kind of gotta push your front

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.190 
do is you kind of gotta push your front
foot<00:01:25.110> out<00:01:25.290> in<00:01:25.380> front<00:01:26.130> of<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:26.600> cool<00:01:27.600> so<00:01:27.840> this<00:01:28.020> is

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
foot out in front of you cool so this is

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.080 
foot out in front of you cool so this is
the<00:01:28.380> popping<00:01:28.829> step<00:01:29.100> you<00:01:29.280> got<00:01:29.490> that<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:30.060> then

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
the popping step you got that and then

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.969 
the popping step you got that and then
the<00:01:30.509> dragging<00:01:30.960> step<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:31.500> actually<00:01:31.650> got

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
the dragging step and you actually got

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.460 
the dragging step and you actually got
that<00:01:32.189> quite<00:01:32.520> well<00:01:32.759> too<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.360> it's<00:01:34.170> great

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
that quite well too and it's great

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.130 
that quite well too and it's great
because<00:01:34.680> when<00:01:35.070> you<00:01:35.220> do<00:01:35.400> drag<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.119> board<00:01:36.479> it<00:01:37.079> is

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
because when you do drag the board it is

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.770 
because when you do drag the board it is
going<00:01:37.860> with<00:01:38.280> your<00:01:38.579> foot<00:01:38.850> which<00:01:39.090> is<00:01:39.240> exactly

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
going with your foot which is exactly

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.480 
going with your foot which is exactly
what<00:01:40.049> you<00:01:40.200> want<00:01:40.439> you<00:01:40.650> want<00:01:40.829> your<00:01:41.040> front<00:01:41.250> foot

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
what you want you want your front foot

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.730 
what you want you want your front foot
to<00:01:41.670> stick<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.240> top<00:01:42.450> of<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.689> board<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.229> you

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
to stick to the top of the board and you

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.340 
to stick to the top of the board and you
want<00:01:43.890> your<00:01:44.100> board<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.430> pop<00:01:44.670> up<00:01:44.939> as<00:01:45.119> you're<00:01:45.930> your

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
want your board to pop up as you're your

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.130 
want your board to pop up as you're your
front<00:01:46.680> foot<00:01:46.829> comes<00:01:47.070> up<00:01:47.310> into<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.700> air<00:01:47.880> so<00:01:48.270> the

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
front foot comes up into the air so the

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.230 
front foot comes up into the air so the
step<00:01:49.649> that<00:01:49.799> we're<00:01:49.979> missing<00:01:50.159> is<00:01:50.579> as<00:01:50.820> soon<00:01:51.090> as

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
step that we're missing is as soon as

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.499 
step that we're missing is as soon as
that<00:01:51.750> board<00:01:52.229> is<00:01:52.439> up<00:01:52.649> into<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.220> air<00:01:53.430> you<00:01:54.210> got<00:01:54.390> to

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
that board is up into the air you got to

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.120 
that board is up into the air you got to
continue<00:01:54.990> bringing<00:01:55.170> your<00:01:55.500> back<00:01:55.740> foot<00:01:56.100> up

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
continue bringing your back foot up

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.389 
continue bringing your back foot up
while<00:01:57.119> you<00:01:57.299> push<00:01:57.600> your<00:01:57.960> front<00:01:58.229> foot<00:01:58.469> out<00:01:58.680> so

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
while you push your front foot out so

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.020 
while you push your front foot out so
it's<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.700> step<00:01:59.939> right<00:02:00.350> there<00:02:01.350> where<00:02:02.280> I<00:02:02.310> push

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
it's the step right there where I push

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.060 
it's the step right there where I push
my<00:02:03.390> front<00:02:03.689> foot<00:02:03.780> out<00:02:04.079> in<00:02:04.170> front<00:02:04.380> of<00:02:04.740> me<00:02:04.829> and

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
my front foot out in front of me and

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.380 
my front foot out in front of me and
then<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:05.759> continue<00:02:06.630> bringing<00:02:06.840> my<00:02:07.170> back<00:02:07.530> foot<00:02:07.860> up

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
then I continue bringing my back foot up

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.690 
then I continue bringing my back foot up
so<00:02:09.390> I<00:02:09.750> don't<00:02:10.020> even<00:02:10.140> know<00:02:10.440> how<00:02:10.950> well<00:02:11.370> I've

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
so I don't even know how well I've

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.260 
so I don't even know how well I've
covered<00:02:12.000> this<00:02:12.239> before<00:02:12.450> but

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
covered this before but

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.480 
covered this before but
you<00:02:13.390> know<00:02:13.510> honestly<00:02:13.660> you<00:02:13.990> have<00:02:14.200> to<00:02:14.410> pay<00:02:15.250> close

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
you know honestly you have to pay close

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.180 
you know honestly you have to pay close
attention<00:02:15.520> to<00:02:16.000> your<00:02:16.180> knee<00:02:16.600> and<00:02:16.990> as<00:02:17.620> you<00:02:17.950> bring

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
attention to your knee and as you bring

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.550 
attention to your knee and as you bring
your<00:02:18.250> knee<00:02:18.610> up<00:02:18.880> your<00:02:19.480> knee<00:02:19.630> also<00:02:19.960> has<00:02:20.260> to<00:02:20.410> go

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
your knee up your knee also has to go

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.120 
your knee up your knee also has to go
out<00:02:21.220> in<00:02:21.970> front<00:02:22.060> of<00:02:22.810> your<00:02:22.990> nose<00:02:23.200> so<00:02:23.650> it<00:02:23.830> kind<00:02:24.040> of

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
out in front of your nose so it kind of

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.220 
out in front of your nose so it kind of
just<00:02:24.430> goes<00:02:24.640> straight<00:02:24.880> out<00:02:25.360> and<00:02:25.600> levels<00:02:26.020> out

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
just goes straight out and levels out

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.230 
just goes straight out and levels out
and<00:02:26.560> that's<00:02:27.130> what's<00:02:27.400> going<00:02:27.610> to<00:02:27.640> level<00:02:28.060> out

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
and that's what's going to level out

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.960 
and that's what's going to level out
your<00:02:28.300> board<00:02:28.840> in<00:02:29.020> the<00:02:29.140> air<00:02:29.280> so<00:02:30.280> that<00:02:30.460> step<00:02:30.760> is

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
your board in the air so that step is

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.270 
your board in the air so that step is
super<00:02:31.360> super<00:02:31.570> super<00:02:31.990> important<00:02:32.680> and<00:02:33.010> that's

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
super super super important and that's

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.660 
super super super important and that's
the<00:02:33.460> one<00:02:33.640> that<00:02:33.880> really<00:02:34.330> you<00:02:34.510> need<00:02:34.810> to<00:02:34.870> work<00:02:35.170> on

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
the one that really you need to work on

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.880 
the one that really you need to work on
that<00:02:36.670> one's<00:02:36.850> also<00:02:37.200> harder<00:02:38.200> to<00:02:38.350> work<00:02:38.500> on<00:02:38.710> than

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
that one's also harder to work on than

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.620 
that one's also harder to work on than
the<00:02:38.980> other<00:02:39.130> ones<00:02:39.340> because<00:02:39.610> you<00:02:39.940> can't<00:02:40.210> just

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
the other ones because you can't just

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.600 
the other ones because you can't just
stand<00:02:40.870> still<00:02:41.140> and<00:02:41.440> practice<00:02:42.040> dragging<00:02:42.460> your

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
stand still and practice dragging your

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.430 
stand still and practice dragging your
foot<00:02:42.790> up<00:02:42.880> the<00:02:43.030> board<00:02:43.060> like<00:02:43.870> I'm<00:02:44.080> showing<00:02:44.290> you

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
foot up the board like I'm showing you

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.070 
foot up the board like I'm showing you
here<00:02:44.950> but<00:02:45.790> you<00:02:45.970> have<00:02:46.000> to<00:02:46.150> actually<00:02:46.450> pop<00:02:46.870> up

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
here but you have to actually pop up

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.960 
here but you have to actually pop up
into<00:02:47.260> the<00:02:47.440> air<00:02:47.620> in<00:02:47.890> order<00:02:48.070> to<00:02:48.310> practice<00:02:48.520> it

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
into the air in order to practice it

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.280 
into the air in order to practice it
because<00:02:49.840> it's<00:02:50.080> just<00:02:50.440> leveling<00:02:51.160> out<00:02:51.310> the<00:02:51.460> board

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
because it's just leveling out the board

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.990 
because it's just leveling out the board
one<00:02:53.290> thing<00:02:53.500> that<00:02:53.680> might<00:02:53.860> help<00:02:54.010> you<00:02:54.190> also<00:02:54.370> is<00:02:54.760> as

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
further back on the board and that's

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.100

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.740 
writing and then you're gonna practice
your<00:03:23.530> Ollie's<00:03:23.920> while<00:03:24.190> writing<00:03:24.820> so<00:03:25.390> that's

your Ollie's while writing so that's

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.470 
your Ollie's while writing so that's
kind<00:03:26.020> of<00:03:26.050> your<00:03:26.110> next<00:03:26.470> step<00:03:26.680> here<00:03:27.010> and<00:03:27.700> also<00:03:28.090> if

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
kind of your next step here and also if

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.270 
kind of your next step here and also if
you're<00:03:28.870> doing<00:03:28.900> it<00:03:29.380> while<00:03:29.530> riding<00:03:29.800> that<00:03:30.070> should

you're doing it while riding that should

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.690 
you're doing it while riding that should
help<00:03:30.430> out<00:03:30.700> your<00:03:31.480> just<00:03:32.470> motion<00:03:33.160> your<00:03:33.340> forward

help out your just motion your forward
motion<00:03:34.060> of<00:03:34.150> pushing<00:03:34.570> that<00:03:34.720> front<00:03:34.990> foot<00:03:35.140> out

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
motion of pushing that front foot out

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.110 
motion of pushing that front foot out
being<00:03:35.860> able<00:03:35.950> to<00:03:36.070> love<00:03:36.340> a<00:03:36.400> lot<00:03:36.640> in<00:03:36.850> the<00:03:36.970> air
