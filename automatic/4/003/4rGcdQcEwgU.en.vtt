00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:06.860
 [Music] 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.860
 [Applause] 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.629
 what most do not take into account is 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.039
 when between the legs guys like 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:15.960
 addicts those are always at 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:18.509
 pending the videos that we upload to me 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.700
 I love to train my legs so 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:23.400
 today we will talk about it and let's be 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:26.489
 most sincere when trains you 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:30.029
 like to train what you see in front of 

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:31.770
 mirror ok and neglect the back 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.320
 for example in the case of the legs 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:37.590
 we train much more what are the 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.390
 pictures or the front part of 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.520
 the legs is what is hidden 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.380
 back therefore a mirror and train very 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.620
 little what are the hamstrings that 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.450
 It is the back of the legs 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.160
 that's why the various news that I 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.410
 send on legs 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.040
 Meoni are usually predominant 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:01:00.640
 Exercises such as press squats 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:02.310
 leg extensions strides 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.410
 among others 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:07.080
 in these streets that is mainly 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:09.390
 for cuadrarse because most do not have 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.850
 very developed local writers 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.160
 but from the aesthetic point of view 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.920
 wants to produce good legs in 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.290
 all sense developed forward and 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.110
 developed back and also from the 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.970
 point of view to prevent injuries then 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.130
 with your quadriceps behind much more 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.860
 developed from our ideals that 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.960
 causes an imbalance to be generated but 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.640
 there is a risk of injury that 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.619
 I'll give you three tips so that 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.600
 can develop your script and vials and 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.660
 so you can say good legs 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.880
 symmetrical first the best range of 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:44.100
 repetitions for writers in 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.890
 exercises where pressure your legs 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.790
 for example the tight leg cur 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:53.400
 Cur alternate legs stopped ass of 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.830
 sitting legs what is recommended is 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.840
 use low transmissions from other 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.050
 addresses less then because 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.980
 The hamstrings have mainly 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:06.410
 fast shrink fibers instead 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:09.650
 the exercises all estenssoro of the 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:12.110
 hip intervenes as for example weight 

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:15.130
 dead with semi-rigid legs weight 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.130
 Romanian dead 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.989
 back extensions 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.780
 here mainly fibers work 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.800
 slow shrinkage which is why 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:30.830
 you need a greater number of repetitions 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.930
 second stretches his quadriceps one stroke 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.170
 not excellent is stretching the quadriceps 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.610
 between your hamstring series as 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.610
 the quadriceps with the muscle 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.770
 antagonist when stretching them they go 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.780
 to relax import height strength of 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.570
 contraction of the instructors will be 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.740
 greater making you much 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.740
 more effective 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.790
 ah 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.650
 and third each time the position of your 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.239
 feet but before they have know the two 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:09.049
 positions 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:12.799
 this is the two succession and this is the 

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:15.650
 pressure plant now that the courses 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:18.290
 of legs lying down and sitting for 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.599
 able to lift the maximum weight 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.459
 the positive phase that is the part of the 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:23.420
 repetition when we are all more 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.430
 weak 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.530
 let's place your feet then 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.900
 bending as you can see and in the phase 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:32.120
 negative of repetition that is when 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.319
 we're going back that's when all 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.389
 we are stronger 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:38.780
 we will do that the calves do not 

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:41.389
 intervene by placing your feet in a 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.239
 position of the flex plan and so 

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:46.730
 send as much tension as possible to 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:48.500
 hamstrings good guys after the video 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.019
 today I hope that this has liked and 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.639
 remember to train with everything 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:54.919
 development legs is really a 

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:56.370
 good legs than the girls 

00:03:54.919 --> 00:04:00.269
 close 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:02.430
 now comment below if you train or not and 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:04.680
