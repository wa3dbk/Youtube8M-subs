automatic<00:00:25.189> difference<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:26.869> guess<00:00:27.869> you<00:00:28.140> call<00:00:28.320> it

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
automatic difference I guess you call it

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.640 
automatic difference I guess you call it
where's<00:00:29.460> it<00:00:29.640> there<00:00:29.820> it<00:00:29.910> is<00:00:29.970> right<00:00:30.179> there<00:00:30.650> it's

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
where's it there it is right there it's

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.459 
where's it there it is right there it's
very<00:00:31.710> simple<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.219> wire<00:00:32.809> 1<00:00:33.809> wire<00:00:34.020> is<00:00:34.170> ground

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
very simple a wire 1 wire is ground

very simple a wire 1 wire is ground
which<00:00:35.399> is<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.640> white<00:00:35.820> one<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.739> the<00:00:37.739> other<00:00:37.890> one

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
which is the white one and the other one

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.360 
which is the white one and the other one
goes<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.370> backup<00:00:38.850> lights<00:00:39.110> so<00:00:40.129> then<00:00:41.129> you<00:00:41.219> go<00:00:41.309> to

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
goes to backup lights so then you go to

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.729 
goes to backup lights so then you go to
reverse<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.629> your<00:00:42.809> backup<00:00:43.170> lights<00:00:43.350> turn<00:00:43.620> on

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
reverse and your backup lights turn on

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.549 
reverse and your backup lights turn on
it<00:00:43.920> sends<00:00:44.280> power<00:00:44.539> to<00:00:45.539> this<00:00:45.690> device<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.350> then

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
it sends power to this device and then

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.500 
it sends power to this device and then
from<00:00:47.010> there<00:00:47.270> the<00:00:48.270> electronics<00:00:48.840> take<00:00:49.050> over

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
from there the electronics take over

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.970 
from there the electronics take over
I'll<00:00:51.510> just<00:00:51.660> focus<00:00:52.050> in<00:00:52.379> there<00:00:52.590> and<00:00:52.710> make<00:00:52.829> it<00:00:52.860> a

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
I'll just focus in there and make it a

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.430 
I'll just focus in there and make it a
little<00:00:53.100> better-looking

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
little better-looking

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:01.530

don't always have that constant beeping
its<00:02:24.540> makes<00:02:24.840> it<00:02:24.989> a<00:02:25.049> bit<00:02:25.200> better
