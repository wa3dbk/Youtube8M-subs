something<00:00:55.430> like<00:00:55.520> that<00:00:55.840> so<00:00:56.840> let's<00:00:57.199> see<00:00:57.320> how<00:00:57.559> it

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
something like that so let's see how it

together<00:01:00.280> it's<00:01:01.280> kind<00:01:01.489> of<00:01:01.579> difficult<00:01:02.120> because

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
together it's kind of difficult because

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:04.359 
together it's kind of difficult because
it<00:01:02.600> says<00:01:02.930> that<00:01:03.199> you<00:01:03.379> have<00:01:03.590> to<00:01:03.800> you<00:01:03.890> have<00:01:03.920> to<00:01:04.190> use
