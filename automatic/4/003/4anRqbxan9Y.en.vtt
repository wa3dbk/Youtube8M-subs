00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.090
 hey i have six tips for you today 

00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:07.400
 for long fingernails 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.629
 I hear of mine very often 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:12.320
 friends or when I'm in school 

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:14.900
 because many ask me if I am 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.390
 eg has attached but that is mine 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:20.000
 close to nature and I'm glad that they are so 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.890
 can stay long because I have from 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.470
 nature from the hard egl I have 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:28.430
 inherited from my mother and I am pleased 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:31.220
 me just full of it now I have 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:34.100
 tips for you as you have for so long 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:38.960
 can grow if it works soon 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:41.810
 the first tip is always nail 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.460
 apply nail polish is important because that 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.050
 is like a second layer on the 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.260
 nail 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:51.470
 that makes the more stable and it needs 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.420
 to be a clear varnish because of the 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.070
 is also for a guest too 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.070
 nail polish is also like one 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:01.610
 layers you see you do not take so 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:04.009
 that we tip each other 1 2 is after all 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.630
 The nails then have the less 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:08.570
 attack surface if someday the 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.820
 come on side with me it works out 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.770
 Every case was very good. I found it once 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.560
 even trying to wear square but 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:18.950
 because they always tore and me 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:22.760
 I thought why why me 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:25.549
 you and celebrated and that was gone you 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.470
 always want to be longer and longer and then 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:31.100
 is that such a transition to 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:34.220
 third of the third tip is always fine 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.260
 Fine is important if you can cut 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.840
 it happens that individual 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.180
 Tell stories about the nail replacement 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.740
 can deduct 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.140
 and then the name would be even thinner 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.619
 as if he were like that already 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.900
 so thin is not synonymous schipser use 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:54.200
 it's just like a pair of scissors 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:57.079
 fine but with so close I was not with 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.420
 such a hard where you gave birth immediately 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:03.500
 has a short blow but one 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:06.970
 fine that in nothing hard or something 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:10.140
 Immediately makes the way off 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.630
 then the fourth is here active 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.880
 I find toothpaste fighting by hand 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.569
 right because then the hands are not 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.670
 more so dry 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.220
 and if this comes on the nail board 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.830
 Does that make the nail too ? 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:26.310
 then growing is just a bit 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:30.030
 more stable and it feels easy 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:33.630
 better for me then the fifth tip 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:37.739
 is not polen that is not good too 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:40.220
 if it is just here nagler over the 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:43.080
 freshly painted nail has gone 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.660
 then do not try as pick up or 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.870
 if you have dry skin so yes 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.690
 rather then do not use hand cream 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.430
 try the dry skin 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:57.360
 and then it will be 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:00.360
 In red and unpleasant then hurt 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.280
 and even bleed and that 's natural 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.660
 then a temptation then the 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.100
 scratch off nail polish again or 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.590
 sometimes it just happens and then 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.780
 it is especially here on the side 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.090
 Yes , you already need me 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.830
 at least sometimes 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:17.250
 and there you are sometimes the one 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:22.170
 nail polish or the situation even one and 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:26.870
 that one wants to avoid then already the 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:29.610
 sixth taps a last tip in everyday life 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:33.090
 Attention is important even if you 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:35.430
 for example, just from a bottle or 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.370
 from the nail polish here the label 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.950
 picks up because there will claim if the 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.620
 needle again 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:45.239
 and so then the nail polish comes off again 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:49.620
 or the brand an even extends 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:51.209
 and you want to avoid that so in the 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.950
 Beware everyday even if it only 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.040
 Small things are always possible 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:58.560
 happen again that the nail enters 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:01.560
 but you should not 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.269
 if the nail is torn immediately 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.970
 try the small job 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:08.280
 to map because then travels 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.950
 then usually more 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:14.310
 has a charming little nail file with you 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:17.609
 It's best to nail it 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:20.160
 fall around again and a few 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.070
 until then , there is the small corner 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.620
 that's gone 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:27.500
 Much better and natural for the nail 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:32.480
 even among those who do not even carry because 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:34.850
 then he stays so nice long so that 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:38.440
 The six tips I was for now 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:42.920
 you had to grow for long nails 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:46.430
 and I hope you can do it as well 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:48.320
 with me and then we'll see each other 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:52.780
 already on sunday at the next video 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.780
 so distance
