there<00:00:08.940> are<00:00:09.000> two<00:00:09.180> types<00:00:09.450> of<00:00:09.570> energy<00:00:09.720> energy

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
there are two types of energy energy

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.260 
there are two types of energy energy
from<00:00:10.830> nourishment<00:00:11.340> and<00:00:11.520> energy<00:00:12.060> from

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:12.270 
from nourishment and energy from

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:14.580 
from nourishment and energy from
stimulation

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:14.590 
stimulation

nourishment is proactive this long-term
when<00:00:24.310> you<00:00:24.430> eat<00:00:24.580> sugary<00:00:25.060> foods<00:00:25.510> the<00:00:25.810> pauses<00:00:26.260> and

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:26.440 
when you eat sugary foods the pauses and

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.769 
when you eat sugary foods the pauses and
insulin<00:00:26.860> rush<00:00:27.040> gives<00:00:27.850> you<00:00:27.970> energy<00:00:28.150> right<00:00:28.540> away

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:28.779 
insulin rush gives you energy right away

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:31.260 
insulin rush gives you energy right away
it<00:00:29.200> does<00:00:29.440> work<00:00:29.740> but<00:00:30.220> it's<00:00:30.340> short-term<00:00:30.970> and

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:31.270 
it does work but it's short-term and

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.260 
it does work but it's short-term and
it's<00:00:31.390> fleeting<00:00:31.779> I<00:00:32.140> call<00:00:32.830> that<00:00:33.370> biological

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.270 
it's fleeting I call that biological

it's fleeting I call that biological
debt<00:00:34.510> when<00:00:35.050> you<00:00:35.140> have<00:00:35.230> to<00:00:35.320> pay<00:00:35.500> it<00:00:35.620> back

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
debt when you have to pay it back

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.470 
debt when you have to pay it back
kind<00:00:36.520> of<00:00:36.550> like<00:00:36.670> shopping<00:00:37.000> with<00:00:37.090> a<00:00:37.150> credit<00:00:37.270> card

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.480 
kind of like shopping with a credit card

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.140 
kind of like shopping with a credit card
you<00:00:37.840> get<00:00:38.079> the<00:00:38.230> energy<00:00:38.380> now<00:00:38.740> but<00:00:39.460> you<00:00:39.579> do<00:00:39.850> have

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:40.150 
you get the energy now but you do have

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.740 
you get the energy now but you do have
to<00:00:40.300> pay<00:00:40.450> it<00:00:40.540> back

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:40.750 
to pay it back

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:48.480 
to pay it back
and<00:00:41.410> when<00:00:41.650> the<00:00:42.430> crash<00:00:42.700> comes<00:00:43.060> the<00:00:44.020> bill<00:00:44.230> is<00:00:44.410> big

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:48.490 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.790 

a<00:00:48.550> lot<00:00:49.450> of<00:00:49.480> people<00:00:49.720> try<00:00:49.900> and<00:00:50.020> pay<00:00:50.140> it<00:00:50.260> off<00:00:50.410> with

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 
a lot of people try and pay it off with

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.620 
a lot of people try and pay it off with
more<00:00:51.070> stimulation<00:00:51.610> and<00:00:52.180> then<00:00:52.330> you<00:00:52.420> get<00:00:52.540> the

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:52.630 
more stimulation and then you get the

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.080 
more stimulation and then you get the
cycle<00:00:53.080> so<00:00:53.290> it<00:00:53.410> goes<00:00:53.670> stimulation<00:00:54.670> fatigue

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.090 
cycle so it goes stimulation fatigue

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.540 
cycle so it goes stimulation fatigue
stimulation<00:00:55.690> fatigue<00:00:55.900> cycles<00:00:56.650> like<00:00:56.800> that<00:00:57.040> you

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
stimulation fatigue cycles like that you

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:58.860 
stimulation fatigue cycles like that you
just<00:00:57.580> look<00:00:57.730> around<00:00:58.090> you<00:00:58.210> see<00:00:58.330> all<00:00:58.420> the<00:00:58.540> donut

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
just look around you see all the donut

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.660 
just look around you see all the donut
shops<00:00:59.110> and<00:00:59.290> the<00:00:59.350> coffee<00:00:59.560> shops<00:00:59.890> it's<00:01:00.370> very

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
shops and the coffee shops it's very

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:03.120 
shops and the coffee shops it's very
clear<00:01:01.030> that<00:01:01.180> we're<00:01:01.330> society<00:01:02.010> dependent<00:01:03.010> on

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.130 
clear that we're society dependent on

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.370 
clear that we're society dependent on
these<00:01:03.640> stimulants<00:01:04.090> to<00:01:04.390> get<00:01:04.600> energy<00:01:04.809> just<00:01:05.230> to

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:05.380 
these stimulants to get energy just to

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:06.990 
these stimulants to get energy just to
get<00:01:05.500> through<00:01:05.680> the<00:01:05.770> day<00:01:05.920> and<00:01:06.100> each<00:01:06.550> time<00:01:06.880> that

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
get through the day and each time that

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.120 
get through the day and each time that

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
here even violent video games and that's

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.450 
here even violent video games and that's
actually<00:01:50.290> given<00:01:50.650> birth<00:01:50.830> the<00:01:51.040> whole<00:01:51.190> theory

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
actually given birth the whole theory

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:53.820 
actually given birth the whole theory
that<00:01:51.670> kids<00:01:52.600> when<00:01:52.840> they<00:01:52.929> play<00:01:53.110> violent<00:01:53.740> video

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
that kids when they play violent video

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.190 
that kids when they play violent video
games<00:01:54.220> get<00:01:55.060> an<00:01:55.210> adrenaline<00:01:55.390> rush<00:01:55.840> and<00:01:56.020> then

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
games get an adrenaline rush and then

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.480 
games get an adrenaline rush and then
they<00:01:56.259> get<00:01:56.350> fatigued<00:01:56.740> after<00:01:56.890> so<00:01:57.250> then<00:01:57.369> they

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
they get fatigued after so then they

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.810 
they get fatigued after so then they
crave<00:01:57.789> sugary<00:01:58.390> foods<00:01:58.690> and<00:01:59.280> even<00:02:00.280> caffeine<00:02:00.460> in

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
crave sugary foods and even caffeine in

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.810 
crave sugary foods and even caffeine in
some<00:02:00.970> cases<00:02:01.360> which<00:02:01.810> can<00:02:01.960> actually<00:02:02.229> lead<00:02:02.530> to<00:02:02.820> a

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
some cases which can actually lead to a

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.359 
some cases which can actually lead to a
chemical<00:02:04.660> addiction<00:02:04.780> of<00:02:05.350> stimulation<00:02:06.009> and

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
chemical addiction of stimulation and

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:12.210 
chemical addiction of stimulation and
that<00:02:06.610> becomes<00:02:06.970> a<00:02:07.060> problem

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.430 

what's<00:02:13.030> the<00:02:13.180> difference<00:02:13.510> between<00:02:13.750> energy

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
what's the difference between energy

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.530 
what's the difference between energy
from<00:02:14.710> stimulation<00:02:15.460> as<00:02:15.790> opposed<00:02:16.120> to<00:02:16.180> energy

from stimulation as opposed to energy

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.150 
from stimulation as opposed to energy
from<00:02:16.720> nourishment<00:02:17.200> well<00:02:17.830> there's<00:02:17.950> a<00:02:18.010> few

leads<00:02:37.150> to<00:02:37.300> recalibration<00:02:38.140> I<00:02:38.350> learned<00:02:39.280> about

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
leads to recalibration I learned about

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.830 
leads to recalibration I learned about
recalibration<00:02:40.150> and<00:02:40.270> it<00:02:40.330> was<00:02:40.420> a<00:02:40.450> few<00:02:40.630> years

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
recalibration and it was a few years

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.510 
recalibration and it was a few years
back<00:02:41.050> and<00:02:41.290> I<00:02:41.320> tried<00:02:41.680> this<00:02:41.770> experiment<00:02:42.100> where<00:02:42.490> I

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 
back and I tried this experiment where I

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.000 
back and I tried this experiment where I
actually<00:02:43.330> ain't<00:02:43.960> nothing<00:02:44.380> but<00:02:44.470> greens<00:02:44.770> for

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
actually ain't nothing but greens for

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.650 
actually ain't nothing but greens for
about<00:02:45.130> three<00:02:45.370> days<00:02:45.580> and<00:02:45.850> then<00:02:46.330> I<00:02:46.360> had<00:02:46.570> some

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
about three days and then I had some

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.270 
about three days and then I had some
blueberries<00:02:47.230> and<00:02:47.500> it<00:02:47.590> felt<00:02:47.860> like<00:02:47.920> I<00:02:48.040> just

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
blueberries and it felt like I just

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.130 
blueberries and it felt like I just
drank<00:02:48.460> a<00:02:48.550> lot<00:02:48.760> of<00:02:48.790> coffee<00:02:48.910> because<00:02:49.630> my<00:02:49.810> body

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
drank a lot of coffee because my body

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.590 
drank a lot of coffee because my body
had<00:02:50.380> recalibrated<00:02:51.250> on<00:02:51.370> how<00:02:51.760> it<00:02:51.940> senses<00:02:52.360> food

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600

so<00:02:53.200> no<00:02:53.380> longer<00:02:53.740> required<00:02:54.190> stimulants<00:02:55.060> to<00:02:55.270> have

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
so no longer required stimulants to have

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.680 
so no longer required stimulants to have
a<00:02:55.480> lot<00:02:55.750> of<00:02:55.870> energy<00:02:56.230> so<00:02:57.040> that<00:02:57.760> is<00:02:57.940> a<00:02:57.970> good<00:02:58.210> way<00:02:58.420> to

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
a lot of energy so that is a good way to

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.380 
a lot of energy so that is a good way to
start<00:02:59.620> the<00:02:59.710> recalibration<00:03:00.040> process<00:03:00.790> and<00:03:00.970> then

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
start the recalibration process and then

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.300 
start the recalibration process and then
get<00:03:01.600> your<00:03:01.690> energy<00:03:02.080> from<00:03:02.230> Whole<00:03:02.530> Foods<00:03:02.560> and<00:03:03.070> not
