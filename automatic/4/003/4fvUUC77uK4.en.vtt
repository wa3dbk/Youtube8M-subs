00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
can't really make it and so you hook the

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.639 
can't really make it and so you hook the
white<00:00:54.899> piece<00:00:55.760> it's<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.940> flat<00:00:57.210> piece<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:57.899> he'll

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
white piece it's a flat piece and he'll

just took it on right there and
sometimes<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.390> can<00:01:03.600> fail<00:01:07.189> so<00:01:08.189> you<00:01:08.250> should<00:01:08.549> hook

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
sometimes it can fail so you should hook

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.980 
sometimes it can fail so you should hook
it<00:01:08.970> on<00:01:09.119> very<00:01:09.420> tight<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:11.060> then<00:01:12.060> we<00:01:12.750> need<00:01:12.780> a
