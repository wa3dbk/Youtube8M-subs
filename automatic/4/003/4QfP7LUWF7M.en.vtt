00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.130
 today we are going to do an analysis of the 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.289
 new color combination of the 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.500
 ninth generation of the mercurial vapor 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.590
 of nike as you all know the nucleus at 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.570
 steam is the lightest model 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.970
 to boost the speed of the 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.190
 footballers and is ninth generation has 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.960
 come out unexpectedly that is to say they have 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.149
 advanced the 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.290
 the production of this boot because 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:41.030
 nobody had developed a new 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.890
 material for the housing that exceeded 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.170
 much the model chosen for the octave 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.210
 generation therefore did not want money 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.960
 too much hidden time and they have pulled it 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:54.699
 to light as we can see in the video the 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.699
 case presents small dimples 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.630
 now maybe dimples serves to 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.430
 manage the contact that the air makes 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.899
 with the surface of the boot when 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.850
 we hit a ball that will come out more 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:06.860
 of 100 kilometers per hour means that 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.960
 the foot at the end of a higher speed 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.060
 even at those 5 meters per hour 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.740
 therefore the air in contact with the 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.540
 boot very aggressively and is 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.860
 necessary to manage these flows of 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.920
 air so they do not generate 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.240
 nike has been inspired by the balls of 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.190
 golf that as you all know feel 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.780
 while small dimples to be the 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:29.840
 most stable in their trajectory 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.430
 at maximum speed we will notice in 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.190
 no moment in any turbulence 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:37.190
 that can degrade the beating and do 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.170
 that the contact is not natural 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.880
 it is important as well as in addition to 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.680
 general 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.250
 against these curiosities it is important 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.890
 the contact that makes contact with the 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.950
 ball for that you have to use the same 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.259
 material 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.030
 high that he feels and ying this one arrives is a 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.710
 material that besides being very light is 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.329
 what the boot is after is a material 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.369
 perfectly stable is to say does not 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.740
 we have to put too many postures 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.049
 in a thickness too wide for 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.890
 that the boot is stable and armed and 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.690
 navy 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.489
 It also allows us to make the housing of 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.350
 the one-piece boot 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.650
 it represents more seam than the union 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.049
 but in the whole area 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.810
 of the comb inside there is no 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:20.280
 posture that will bother or better go to 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.080
 make feel different tensions that 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.930
 we have 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.350
 the other put the third characteristic 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:29.480
 of this this case is the treatment 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.560
 with condition control the oil that 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.450
 they call 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.510
 It is a treatment that waterproofs 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.310
 housing inside the boot 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.170
 foot and especially when the ball is 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.550
 wet or it's raining is not going to 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.980
 form a film of water in the area 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.630
 external of the boot and that generates 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.940
 aquaplaning or that make lose is going to 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:50.160
 contact the ball with the boot 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.200
 the second participant of this drop is 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.210
 the interior the interior is an interior 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.400
 very fine as we have said very late 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:59.840
 lightweight present in the lateral areas 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.840
 which can be seen in the external zone 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:06.780
 in agreement 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.220
 it is not necessary because it is already 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.070
 stable in itself but good is a 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.270
 extra that gives the drop and finally the 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.820
 template on which you rely on 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.210
 our feet if it is a very light boot 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.580
 it is thought 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:20.140
 aligned the players and the player must 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.880
 go as close as possible to the ground with 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.670
 you take and we see the player more 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.770
 instability there will be therefore disassemble 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.840
 an extremely thin template and with 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.550
 many micro perforations in such a way 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.200
 that we 're going to not notice the 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.150
 presence of the workforce although if 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.950
 It has a sufficient thickness to 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.580
 allow us to cushion because the jump or 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.370
 any aggressive tread we do 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:45.150
 the last important part of the drop of 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.380
 the nuclear vapor 9 is your sole 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.340
 entry into the sole we can see that there 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.340
 two different areas 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.140
 It serves only binding between 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:57.660
 boot housing fiber plate 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.640
 glass and each of the tacos the part 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.580
 The most important is undoubtedly the fiber of 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.019
 all that material 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.430
 here they seem different parts really 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:07.920
 is a single plate that goes from the 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.989
 Heel toe and feature 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.480
 main fiberglass is its 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:13.920
 high reactivity ie it is a 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.840
 a material that always tries to 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.280
 recover this way you have if 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.560
 we submit to any type 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:22.180
 torsion 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.830
 what you will want in the activity of 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.889
 quick videos 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:29.289
 in this way after making a turn 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:31.060
 fast we will have the foot ready to 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:33.939
 execute the next step ie 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.770
 lose as little as possible of 

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:36.980
 energy and time to do each one 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.380
 of the movements 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.940
 and finally we talk about the tacos the 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.380
 characteristic tacos inputs that 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.330
 they have always been present in almerÃ­a 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:45.699
 of love 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:48.490
 is a taco that also presents 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:50.530
 a triad with different edges that is 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.699
 each of the lateralities is about the 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.370
 that we are going to have traction when 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:55.470
 let's be running 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.180
 in the heel area we see that there is a 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:59.100
 single heel each in each row instead of 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.650
 the two characteristics and pounds of 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:04.260
 tacos but present these are cons 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:07.080
 strong that are going to suppose an extra support 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:09.380
 a support surface 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.180
 that we are missing tacos 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.700
 Finally, indicate that it is at the top 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.290
 let's see some small roughness and 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.970
 it's because when a football player or 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.260
 any other type of athletes will run 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:19.430
 at maximum speed 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.870
 usually traction to directly 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.280
 on the tips the first support 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:25.310
 early return on the ground is the 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.720
 the toe of the foot so you are 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.980
 new cities are going to give us an extra 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.950
 of grip when we go to maximum 

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.900
 speed 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:32.940
 the boot is not only made with these 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:36.090
 traveling waves candles 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:38.280
 more usual feature but that 

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:40.320
 It also gives us the possibility of having it 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:43.729
 with a single mixed these tacos 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:45.050
 aluminum will allow us to have 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:47.330
 greater a greater coefficient of 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:49.940
 penetration when we play on ice 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:54.010
 natural that is soft 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:54.010
 and of course we are in that factory 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.950
 but also presented 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:04.160
 the two middle and low destination ranges 

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.500
 of the same characteristics that I 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:07.700
 leaves blanket but with different 

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.860
 variations of 

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:11.669
 of material we managed to advance a 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:16.299
 little bit of water 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:18.129
 it's very similar to the boot but we 

00:06:16.299 --> 00:06:19.620
 presents the control condition therefore 

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:22.199
 we have it 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:23.639
 waterproof characteristics yes 

00:06:22.199 --> 00:06:25.800
 we go to the sole we can see that the 

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:28.020
 fiberglass is only present 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:31.030
 in the middle of the boot after the heel 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:33.180
 is not present in all the 

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:35.289
 surface of the city 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.999
 and finally 

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:38.110
 we find that it no longer has fiber 

00:06:36.999 --> 00:06:40.270
 glass no time hours 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:43.149
 completely plastic and material 

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:44.860
 from the external one is already a plastic 

00:06:43.149 --> 00:06:47.169
 lower quality so it 's the material 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:49.149
 synthetic very light and very stable but 

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:51.800
 in this model that is the victor model and 

00:06:49.149 --> 00:06:55.190
 we no longer have the 

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.190
 with the ball
