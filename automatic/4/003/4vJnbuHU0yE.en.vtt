00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
kind of in between with that because

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.660 
kind of in between with that because
that's<00:00:36.390> typical<00:00:37.260> blizzard<00:00:37.860> they<00:00:38.160> tend<00:00:38.579> to

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
that's typical blizzard they tend to

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.030 
that's typical blizzard they tend to
nerf<00:00:38.969> their<00:00:39.270> games<00:00:39.600> as<00:00:39.960> soon<00:00:40.230> as<00:00:40.440> they<00:00:40.680> are<00:00:40.739> out

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
nerf their games as soon as they are out

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.720 
nerf their games as soon as they are out
for<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.460> few<00:00:41.820> weeks<00:00:42.210> or<00:00:42.629> mumps<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.670> yeah<00:00:44.670> to

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
for a few weeks or mumps and yeah to

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.209 
for a few weeks or mumps and yeah to
make<00:00:45.030> them<00:00:45.270> more<00:00:45.450> accessible<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:46.350> I<00:00:46.739> think

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
make them more accessible and I think

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.990 
make them more accessible and I think
that<00:00:47.579> it's<00:00:48.510> kind<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:49.170> well<00:00:49.860> it<00:00:50.160> could<00:00:50.700> destroy

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
that it's kind of well it could destroy

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.900 
that it's kind of well it could destroy
the<00:00:51.719> core<00:00:52.079> experience<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:53.070> infernal<00:00:53.610> mode<00:00:53.699> if

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
the core experience and infernal mode if

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.049 
the core experience and infernal mode if
it's<00:00:54.120> too<00:00:54.510> easy<00:00:54.770> there<00:00:55.770> has<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.309> be<00:00:56.340> some<00:00:56.760> kind

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
it's too easy there has to be some kind

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.459 
it's too easy there has to be some kind
of<00:00:57.440> incoming<00:00:58.440> damage<00:00:59.000> that<00:01:00.000> remains<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:01.050> the

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
of incoming damage that remains and the

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.910 
of incoming damage that remains and the
thing<00:01:02.010> is<00:01:02.039> if<00:01:02.699> they<00:01:03.420> make<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:03.719> too<00:01:04.140> easy<00:01:04.170> I

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
thing is if they make it too easy I

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.530 
thing is if they make it too easy I
guess<00:01:05.670> it's<00:01:06.140> kind<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.409> well<00:01:07.979> it<00:01:08.909> doesn't

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
guess it's kind of well it doesn't

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.359 
guess it's kind of well it doesn't
really<00:01:09.570> feel<00:01:09.990> like<00:01:10.049> infernal<00:01:10.830> mode<00:01:10.950> anymore

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
really feel like infernal mode anymore

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.480 
really feel like infernal mode anymore
because<00:01:11.729> infernal<00:01:12.450> mode<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.900> me<00:01:13.049> is<00:01:13.320> well<00:01:14.189> you

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
because infernal mode to me is well you

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.210 
because infernal mode to me is well you
always<00:01:14.850> are<00:01:15.360> on<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.990> run<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:16.979> should

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
always are on the run and you should

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.730 
always are on the run and you should
always<00:01:17.430> fear<00:01:18.030> of<00:01:18.330> certain<00:01:18.720> death<00:01:18.990> right

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
always fear of certain death right

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.490 
always fear of certain death right
behind<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.700> next<00:01:21.030> corner<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.930> doesn't<00:01:22.290> really

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
behind the next corner it doesn't really

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.219 
behind the next corner it doesn't really
mean<00:01:22.799> that<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.220> has<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.640> be<00:01:23.790> unfair<00:01:24.390> but<00:01:24.960> make

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
mean that it has to be unfair but make

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.280 
mean that it has to be unfair but make
it<00:01:25.259> even<00:01:25.680> less<00:01:26.720> difficult<00:01:27.720> than<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:27.960> was

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
it even less difficult than it was

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.950 
it even less difficult than it was
before<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.829> let's<00:01:29.759> face<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.360> infernal<00:01:30.869> mode

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
before and let's face it infernal mode

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.289 
before and let's face it infernal mode
is<00:01:31.170> so<00:01:31.350> much<00:01:31.530> easier<00:01:31.770> now<00:01:32.040> compared<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:33.119> the

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
is so much easier now compared to the

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.569 
is so much easier now compared to the
initial<00:01:33.570> release<00:01:34.020> infernal<00:01:34.590> mode<00:01:34.710> that<00:01:35.520> I

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
initial release infernal mode that I

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.149 
initial release infernal mode that I
really<00:01:36.000> think<00:01:36.210> okay<00:01:36.659> I<00:01:37.079> don't<00:01:37.619> know<00:01:37.799> if<00:01:38.009> I<00:01:38.130> like

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
really think okay I don't know if I like

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.149 
really think okay I don't know if I like
this<00:01:38.640> so<00:01:39.150> it<00:01:39.810> really<00:01:40.170> just<00:01:40.290> depends<00:01:40.890> how<00:01:41.040> it

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
this so it really just depends how it

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.280 
this so it really just depends how it
plays<00:01:41.400> out<00:01:41.610> in<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.850> end<00:01:42.119> but<00:01:42.450> it's<00:01:42.720> reducing

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
plays out in the end but it's reducing

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.370 
plays out in the end but it's reducing
incoming<00:01:43.740> damage<00:01:43.890> again<00:01:44.540> okay<00:01:45.540> let's<00:01:45.960> let's

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
incoming damage again okay let's let's

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.190 
incoming damage again okay let's let's
just<00:01:46.649> wait<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.070> see<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.729> second<00:01:48.270> one<00:01:48.329> is<00:01:48.540> new

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
just wait and see the second one is new

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.139 
just wait and see the second one is new
went<00:01:49.500> infernal<00:01:50.070> machine<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.670> that's<00:01:50.939> a

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
went infernal machine and that's a

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.539 
went infernal machine and that's a
really<00:01:51.329> great<00:01:51.750> thing<00:01:52.130> so<00:01:53.130> this<00:01:53.310> thing<00:01:53.520> is

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
really great thing so this thing is

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.929 
really great thing so this thing is
supposed<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:54.450> be<00:01:54.630> some<00:01:55.079> kind<00:01:55.110> of<00:01:55.560> boss<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.340> I

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
supposed to be some kind of boss and I

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.840 
supposed to be some kind of boss and I
really<00:01:57.719> think<00:01:57.960> that<00:01:58.320> this<00:01:58.799> adds<00:01:59.159> a<00:01:59.610> lot<00:01:59.790> to

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
really think that this adds a lot to

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.749 
really think that this adds a lot to
diablo<00:02:00.570> 3<00:02:00.840> making<00:02:01.200> additional<00:02:01.890> content<00:02:02.520> is

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
diablo 3 making additional content is

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.389 
diablo 3 making additional content is
nothing<00:02:03.360> that<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.930> lot<00:02:04.140> of<00:02:04.170> people<00:02:04.399> expected

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
nothing that a lot of people expected

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.119 
nothing that a lot of people expected
out<00:02:05.579> of<00:02:05.610> this<00:02:05.969> game<00:02:06.299> at<00:02:06.659> least<00:02:07.079> so<00:02:07.439> soon<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.950> lot

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
out of this game at least so soon a lot

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.339 
out of this game at least so soon a lot
of<00:02:08.280> people<00:02:08.629> expected<00:02:09.629> something<00:02:09.899> like<00:02:10.020> an

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
of people expected something like an

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.190
