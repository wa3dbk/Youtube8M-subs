00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000 
what I saw when we played soccer and I
played<00:03:50.239> goalie<00:03:50.919> but<00:03:51.919> it's<00:03:53.169> it's<00:03:54.169> not<00:03:54.409> because

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
played goalie but it's it's not because

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.069 
played goalie but it's it's not because
it's<00:03:55.220> like<00:03:55.370> there's<00:03:56.209> two<00:03:56.449> teams<00:03:56.689> but<00:03:56.900> there's

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.079 
it's like there's two teams but there's

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:58.899 
it's like there's two teams but there's
only<00:03:57.169> one<00:03:57.290> goal<00:03:57.650> so<00:03:57.829> there's<00:03:58.010> no<00:03:58.099> defense<00:03:58.489> but

00:03:58.899 --> 00:03:58.909 
only one goal so there's no defense but

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:00.610 
only one goal so there's no defense but
you<00:03:59.030> can't<00:03:59.209> really<00:03:59.359> play<00:03:59.659> goalie<00:03:59.989> cuz<00:04:00.379> there's

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
you can't really play goalie cuz there's

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.199 
you can't really play goalie cuz there's
no<00:04:00.769> each<00:04:00.919> other<00:04:01.069> it's<00:04:01.220> possible<00:04:01.579> but<00:04:01.760> I<00:04:02.000> still

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:39.730 
want to play it was like okay so I got
up<00:05:38.539> and<00:05:38.750> I<00:05:38.840> went<00:05:38.960> to<00:05:39.050> the<00:05:39.169> gym<00:05:39.320> and<00:05:39.469> I<00:05:39.530> played

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:39.740 
up and I went to the gym and I played

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.270 
up and I went to the gym and I played
dodgeball<00:05:40.009> and<00:05:40.370> it<00:05:40.460> was<00:05:40.550> super<00:05:40.880> fun<00:05:40.909> oh<00:05:42.009> and<00:05:43.009> I

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 
dodgeball and it was super fun oh and I

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.300 
dodgeball and it was super fun oh and I
mean<00:05:43.520> like<00:05:43.699> dodgeball<00:05:44.630> in<00:05:45.500> Japan<00:05:46.039> is

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:46.310 
mean like dodgeball in Japan is

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:48.850 
mean like dodgeball in Japan is
basically<00:05:47.300> the<00:05:47.419> same<00:05:47.449> as<00:05:47.659> it<00:05:48.110> is<00:05:48.259> in<00:05:48.349> America

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:48.860 
basically the same as it is in America

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.640 
basically the same as it is in America
but<00:05:49.340> there's<00:05:49.580> like<00:05:49.820> four<00:05:50.659> rules<00:05:51.080> that<00:05:51.620> are

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:51.650 
but there's like four rules that are

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:56.080 
but there's like four rules that are
tweaked<00:05:52.840> ever<00:05:53.840> so<00:05:54.199> slightly<00:05:54.440> so<00:05:54.830> it's<00:05:55.789> like

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:56.090 
tweaked ever so slightly so it's like

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:58.450 
tweaked ever so slightly so it's like
just<00:05:56.750> confusing<00:05:57.349> enough<00:05:57.440> that<00:05:58.159> you're<00:05:58.310> like

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:58.460 
just confusing enough that you're like

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:02.529 
just confusing enough that you're like
an<00:05:58.820> idea<00:05:59.120> what's<00:05:59.300> going<00:05:59.479> on<00:06:01.240> if<00:06:02.240> it<00:06:02.449> was

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:02.539 
an idea what's going on if it was

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:04.120 
an idea what's going on if it was
completely<00:06:02.690> different<00:06:03.500> it<00:06:03.560> was<00:06:03.680> if<00:06:03.860> it<00:06:03.949> was<00:06:04.070> a

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:04.130 
completely different it was if it was a

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.610 
completely different it was if it was a
completely<00:06:04.699> different<00:06:05.150> thing<00:06:05.330> then<00:06:06.020> it<00:06:06.469> would

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:06.620 
completely different thing then it would

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:09.219 
completely different thing then it would
be<00:06:06.710> easier<00:06:07.070> to<00:06:07.130> understand<00:06:07.690> because<00:06:08.690> it

00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:09.229 
be easier to understand because it

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:10.360 
be easier to understand because it
wouldn't<00:06:09.500> be<00:06:09.590> like<00:06:09.680> oh<00:06:09.889> it's<00:06:10.190> like<00:06:10.340> that

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:10.370 
wouldn't be like oh it's like that

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.719 
wouldn't be like oh it's like that
except<00:06:10.849> that<00:06:11.169> you<00:06:12.169> know<00:06:12.289> that's<00:06:13.130> fine<00:06:13.310> it's

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:13.729 
except that you know that's fine it's

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:16.480 
except that you know that's fine it's
fine<00:06:13.789> i'm<00:06:14.030> just<00:06:14.060> not<00:06:14.270> believe<00:06:14.509> now<00:06:14.659> but<00:06:15.340> it<00:06:16.340> was

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:16.490 
fine i'm just not believe now but it was

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:22.810 
fine i'm just not believe now but it was
just<00:06:16.520> it<00:06:17.090> was<00:06:17.590> it<00:06:18.590> was<00:06:18.770> fun<00:06:19.130> because<00:06:21.669> it<00:06:22.669> was

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:22.820 
just it was it was fun because it was

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:26.700 
just it was it was fun because it was
just<00:06:22.849> an<00:06:23.060> inexplicably<00:06:23.750> like<00:06:24.080> super<00:06:24.620> fun<00:06:25.130> day

just an inexplicably like super fun day
and<00:06:27.710> that<00:06:28.460> it<00:06:28.580> felt<00:06:28.820> like<00:06:29.060> it<00:06:29.330> was<00:06:29.539> targeted

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:33.320 

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.560 

to<00:06:34.320> keep<00:06:34.500> me<00:06:34.650> busy<00:06:34.700> it<00:06:35.700> really<00:06:35.910> felt<00:06:36.150> like<00:06:36.300> they

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:13.640 
and made it in one super banner and it's
on<00:07:11.670> my<00:07:11.820> facebook<00:07:12.060> page<00:07:12.420> and<00:07:12.660> it<00:07:13.260> seems<00:07:13.530> like

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:13.650 
on my facebook page and it seems like

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:15.860 
on my facebook page and it seems like
all<00:07:14.100> of<00:07:14.130> the<00:07:14.760> creators<00:07:15.180> of<00:07:15.210> the<00:07:15.480> three<00:07:15.660> banners

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:15.870
