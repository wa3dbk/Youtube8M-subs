00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:19.430
 channel desperately land glad to see you all 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:22.369

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.800
 cycling theme again review gadgets 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:28.640
 for bikes, thank you so much 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:31.160
 to a friend for the parcels provided here 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:35.019
 we will consider with you so to speak 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:37.250
 signal tail lamp clearance and for 

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:39.860
 Cyclist can say so once 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:44.210
 cling somewhere around the bottom 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:46.550
 parts of the saddle and serves the dimensions in the dark 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.539
 time of day or what was seen driving 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.660
 cyclist 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:55.129
 so it should consist of 5 red 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:57.469
 LEDs and 2 more laser some not 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:00.440
 know the rays let's say that 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:02.840
 drawn by bike on the way 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:07.759
 some kind of two almost parallel 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:10.550
 this parcel went about 36 lines 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:13.399
 days of its value and there were four whole 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.380
 forty six hundredths of a dollar means here 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:20.450
 This device is powered by two 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:28.489
 AAA batteries and so we open 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:31.520
 parcel look hid better cut 

00:01:28.489 --> 00:01:36.140
 okay let's see how is she 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:39.229
 still so well or wrong so here he is 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.300
 I do not know how to fix them for the summer 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.780
 called here the pipe which leads to 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.300
 the saddle 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:50.229
 behind it it fastens here is the whole thing 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:53.450
 pulls out of this fishing rods 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:55.160
 all this is clamped and put on that 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.590
 the level that we need now I 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.050
 slightly delayed to see this thing 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.420
 see that is it is attached to the pipe 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:06.930
 and here we insert our schedule 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:15.620
 look at this rear signal itself 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:15.620
 So he laundry soap flashlight 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:25.550
 here still on the helmet so there cannon with 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.870
 words and years and lyserg 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:32.090
 so here it is 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:37.200
 back as I understand it here here 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:38.250
 the keyhole is a laser here with us 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.160
 for red 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:46.200
 There are LEDs on the edge. 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:49.620
 I think they are five times 2 and here 3 well 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.380
 Well, let's go with you and get food from 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:57.260
 two batteries and see how he 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.260
 glows maybe it doesn't glow at all 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:07.860
 good space quality in principle in 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.380
 principle is quite a good feature for 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.989
 that kind of money is pretty 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:15.060
 tight and strong made in principle 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:18.209
 neat well apart from some some 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:21.030
 here the elements here are kind of tight 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:24.230
 Like so let's turn on I 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.230
 understand not present at 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.730
 the camera cannot transmit 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:36.720
 all that there is an indescribable beauty 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:39.500
 once for years to press the strobe mode or 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:44.750
 how it is correctly stated is cool yes 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:46.100
 so again years go by such less 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:52.350
 helping 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:55.890
 Iâ€™ll say less so because the police 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:59.850
 all go naked so still sound not enough 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:08.569
 u and the other side was here like 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:10.709
 garland oh gorgeous cool back and forth 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:11.340
 turned off how much we programmatically 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:19.350
 considered 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:22.200
 just burning 2 3 4 5 6 7 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:28.680
 all about these programs from ldovskiy 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:31.020
 can blink it yourself laser well and here 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.570
 imagine you are driving and two such here 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.580
 stripes for you crawl well, probably 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:38.669
 beautiful at night i think this 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:43.790
 even cool extinguish the light ask you 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:47.280
 turn off with no lights above even better 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.830
 but so maybe a little field 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.960
 poorer 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:54.360
 well of course when it is higher to force not 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:57.840
 diverge becomes more such 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:05:00.960
 openwork pictures that's a plus 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:03.660
 it turns on the laser also has 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:06.960
 it turns out can be blinking or 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:09.930
 exactly someone two programs and that's such 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:14.900
 here are the garlands you turn on and it will be difficult 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:20.540
 you do not notice in the nights so well well 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:21.890
 let us have this thing all turned back 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:24.870
 backlight 

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:27.300
 general backlight I am very pleased 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:28.160
 done everything works great 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.330
 superski 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:35.240
 collected wonderful so well yet 

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:37.770
 let's holder look at 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:41.220
 snaps well here and so is the case 

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:44.100
 everything is mounted on a bike zdorovskaya 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:46.830
 the thing everyone recommends them very much 

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:49.440
 I liked the link to this thing
