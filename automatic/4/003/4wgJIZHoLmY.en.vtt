 changes to these organs and rarely 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:51.350
 not used for making tea 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:54.710
 water and tap other than this 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:56.870
 prikepit still at the peak of the looper in the water 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.690

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:14.840
 for a long time to drink 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.400
 black tea then the teeth will turn yellow from 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.430
 green tea large quantities

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:29.120
 written in strong tea is contained 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.580
 a large number of those both on and caffeine 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:34.130
 so it can cause headache and 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:36.170
 insomnia is also strong tea 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:37.910
 bad for heart 

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:40.270
 activity stimulates excretion 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:43.820
 large quantities of gastric juice 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:46.220
 green has fixing properties 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:50.120
 so do not drink to people suffering 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:52.640
 so you should not drink tea at high 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.740
 temperature contained in tea and 

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:59.230
 theophylline is good to raise the temperature 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:06:02.750
 Body green tea is contraindicated under 

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:05.540
 hypotensive since he couple lower 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:09.820
 cake or or blood pressure in 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:15.160
 Generally, I don't know what's true here. 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:19.850
 a lie but there may be some facts here 

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:22.160
 more than 50 true Russian tea yes 

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:25.310
 Here is what to deliver to Russia 

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:27.710
 he may well harm himself 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:31.130
 from all this, one conclusion can be made 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:32.990
 what to look for we will reach me to recognize and 

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:36.170
 not an expert in teas 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:39.830
 but what advice can I give 

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:42.230
 seek not really a real tea 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:45.050
 Here's to the people for the people to 

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:51.370
 which are made to buy only 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:54.950
 here are these wrappers nickname tantalum all sorts of trendy 

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:57.350
 packaging is all of course cheating therefore 

00:06:54.950 --> 00:07:00.830
 need to buy real tea need 

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:04.280
 look for asking people not to believe this 

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:07.460
 advertising because there they need it 

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:09.560
 so long as you bought but what it 

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:13.970

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:19.100
 worry no matter how much they need 

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:23.540
 only revenue that's all so not 

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:25.970
 I know I think if it will be possible to do 

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:28.880
 individual issues review of each tea 

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:30.250
 which is useful which property 

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:34.990
 possesses 

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:37.640
 on this all subscribe to the channel 

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:41.150
