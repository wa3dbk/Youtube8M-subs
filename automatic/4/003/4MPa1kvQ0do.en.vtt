going to take effort it'll take money

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.140 
going to take effort it'll take money
but<00:02:19.989> this<00:02:20.170> can<00:02:20.380> be<00:02:20.500> fixed<00:02:20.800> so<00:02:21.610> when<00:02:21.760> she<00:02:21.880> said

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
but this can be fixed so when she said

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.180 
but this can be fixed so when she said
that<00:02:22.180> I<00:02:22.570> went<00:02:22.900> okay<00:02:23.350> if<00:02:23.590> they<00:02:23.739> are<00:02:23.860> willing<00:02:24.130> to

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
that I went okay if they are willing to

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.390 
that I went okay if they are willing to
work<00:02:24.310> hard<00:02:24.370> if<00:02:24.820> this<00:02:25.030> can<00:02:25.300> be<00:02:25.510> fixed<00:02:26.400> then

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
work hard if this can be fixed then

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.340

actually can't learn if I'm taught in a
different<00:03:02.920> way<00:03:03.040> I<00:03:03.070> just<00:03:03.400> learn<00:03:03.519> differently<00:03:04.030> I

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:04.329 
different way I just learn differently I

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:07.199 
different way I just learn differently I
mean<00:03:05.170> each<00:03:05.320> week<00:03:05.680> they<00:03:06.400> learn<00:03:06.640> more<00:03:06.940> things

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209
