00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
others or was kind of the sisterly

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.560 
others or was kind of the sisterly
aspect<00:02:16.560> perhaps<00:02:16.920> know<00:02:17.430> that<00:02:17.820> the<00:02:18.330> thing<00:02:18.540> that

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
aspect perhaps know that the thing that

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.020 
aspect perhaps know that the thing that
resonates<00:02:19.050> most<00:02:19.230> with<00:02:19.380> me<00:02:19.620> is<00:02:19.770> the<00:02:20.160> this<00:02:20.640> idea

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
resonates most with me is the this idea

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.150 
resonates most with me is the this idea
of<00:02:21.330> love<00:02:21.600> versus<00:02:22.080> fear<00:02:22.380> cuz<00:02:22.710> I<00:02:22.800> think<00:02:23.040> there

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
of love versus fear cuz I think there

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.800 
of love versus fear cuz I think there
are<00:02:23.190> two<00:02:23.430> modes<00:02:23.610> of<00:02:23.820> operation<00:02:23.940> we<00:02:24.510> have<00:02:24.690> as

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
are two modes of operation we have as

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.720 
are two modes of operation we have as
humans<00:02:25.200> it's<00:02:25.710> either<00:02:25.920> you<00:02:26.280> operate<00:02:26.580> out<00:02:26.700> of

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
humans it's either you operate out of

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.730 
humans it's either you operate out of
fear<00:02:27.030> or<00:02:27.060> you<00:02:27.240> operate<00:02:27.570> out<00:02:27.690> of<00:02:27.720> love<00:02:27.990> I<00:02:28.290> think

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
fear or you operate out of love I think

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.560 
fear or you operate out of love I think
every<00:02:29.010> decision<00:02:29.340> can<00:02:29.700> kind<00:02:29.970> of<00:02:30.060> be<00:02:30.210> traced

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
every decision can kind of be traced

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.290 
every decision can kind of be traced
back<00:02:30.720> to<00:02:31.110> that<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:31.530> there's<00:02:32.310> two<00:02:32.700> characters
