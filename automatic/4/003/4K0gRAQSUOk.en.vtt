00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
steel cage just to make it a little bit

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.799 
steel cage just to make it a little bit
more<00:00:30.660> rigid<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.279> then<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.850> clamping<00:00:33.420> unit

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
more rigid and then the clamping unit

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.790 
more rigid and then the clamping unit
from<00:00:34.079> any<00:00:34.350> outboard<00:00:35.059> just<00:00:36.059> bolts<00:00:36.800> straight

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
from any outboard just bolts straight

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.979 
from any outboard just bolts straight
down<00:00:38.100> like<00:00:38.399> that<00:00:38.670> clamps<00:00:39.270> on<00:00:39.450> and<00:00:39.750> your

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
down like that clamps on and your

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.650 
down like that clamps on and your
outboard<00:00:40.350> runs<00:00:40.649> down<00:00:41.040> here<00:00:41.180> so<00:00:42.180> that's<00:00:42.420> how<00:00:42.629> a

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
outboard runs down here so that's how a

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.459 
outboard runs down here so that's how a
mounted<00:00:43.200> it

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
mounted it

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.200 
mounted it
that's<00:00:43.649> just<00:00:43.950> held<00:00:44.160> on<00:00:44.370> with<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:44.670> probably

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
that's just held on with a probably

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.459 
that's just held on with a probably
worker<00:00:45.989> there<00:00:46.260> about<00:00:47.160> ten<00:00:47.550> good<00:00:48.210> sized<00:00:48.629> cable
