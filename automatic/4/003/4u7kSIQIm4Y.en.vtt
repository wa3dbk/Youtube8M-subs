00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:07.210
 and the grapes and welcome to another one 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.219
 widget and how they saw it in the title 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.590
 how to accommodate the cars in our 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:13.209
 garage ok is something that many of were 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.160
 living in what I was doing the 

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:17.250
 past updates and apparently 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.560
 rockstar already paid attention to us and we can 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.599
 accommodate the cars as we are given the 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.339
 gift won 'what we then go to 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:25.869
 proceed and the first thing we will have to 

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:28.089
 to do is to be in the part of our 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:30.669
 garage and enter any of our 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:32.650
 garages and go to the bottom ok 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:34.210
 here you will see a blue circle ok in this 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.550
 part what we will do will be so simple 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.470
 how to hit the right button here and 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.240
 here as they saw it, a 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.250
 very comfortable little eyelash which we 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.780
 will indicate which cars are going 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.790
 to move because you may have 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.460
 repeated cars that we assume 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.470
 I want to move the blazer to two places 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.020
 so the only thing I have to do is 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.790
 just select it and I have to 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.800
 select in a new address here 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.560
 team see it already moved it now 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.110
 let's grab do not know is that environment and 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.730
 we're going to put it where the blazer was 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.890
 previously then we selected 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.570
 this space and how they see we can move 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.100
 the cars at our whim, this is not 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.950
 something pretty good 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.020
 Now I want this where we had the other 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.900
 no to the other surroundings I want them to stick 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.460
 Well, this is right here and the other one 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.680
 blazer that I want it right in the entrance 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.570
 Well, it's as simple as putting it 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.820
 here not then as they see it I already have 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.680
 the cars arranged to my liking and this 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.440
 It serves is quite more than anything for the 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.000
 people who do not look also carry 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.220
 bikes is something that surprised me 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.380
 as you can see here we can also 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.509
 move the bicycles I do not know if 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.880
 you want the bike in any 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:41.740
 bank of these was simply what 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.170
 changes although in the case of equal 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.450
 because I have accommodated bicycles 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.340
 a lolo knows all the bicycles are 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.080
 the same so it's not worth na but keith and 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.909
 here this one to see that I have it right here 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.039
 I have it coming here to be 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.170
 something more comfortable in removing it at the time of 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:58.390
 drive because this is the only thing I do 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.069
 that then this is a simple trick 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.630
 a simple curiosity that I wanted them 

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:04.090
 teach because the laureate is very useful 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.319
 of the game day after day not then I 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.119
 I think it's a pretty trick 

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:09.580
 simple that can help them a lot and 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.530
 here is my golden painting totally 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.180
 modified by me and here is the 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.370

 Which do you like more 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.560
 It's simple but I just wanted them 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.849
 teach that not since a lot of people are 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.739
 question did not come but how can I 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.720

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:27.250
 simple way not and apart is very good 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.569
