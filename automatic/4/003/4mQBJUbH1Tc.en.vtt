00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:37.650 
plastic balls with holes in them so that

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.100 
plastic balls with holes in them so that
will<00:00:38.280> not<00:00:38.489> offer<00:00:38.760> any<00:00:39.210> resistance<00:00:39.540> whatsoever

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
will not offer any resistance whatsoever

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.110 
will not offer any resistance whatsoever

not stop the swing but it will

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.080 
not stop the swing but it will
definitely<00:01:03.540> slow<00:01:04.049> it<00:01:04.199> down<00:01:04.640> so<00:01:05.640> I<00:01:05.670> let<00:01:05.940> the

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
definitely slow it down so I let the

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.530 
definitely slow it down so I let the
weight<00:01:06.270> of<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.450> arm<00:01:06.600> club<00:01:06.810> unit<00:01:07.110> fall<00:01:08.540> wow

look at that
so<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.100> follow-through<00:01:11.430> ended<00:01:12.000> up<00:01:12.090> about

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
so the follow-through ended up about

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.280 
so the follow-through ended up about
here<00:01:12.720> but<00:01:13.440> you<00:01:13.619> can<00:01:13.770> see<00:01:14.270> how<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.330> weight<00:01:15.900> of

certain weight golf balls gonna be

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.710 
certain weight golf balls gonna be
somewhere<00:01:44.340> in<00:01:44.460> between<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.940> volleyball<00:01:45.300> and

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
somewhere in between the volleyball and

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.720 
somewhere in between the volleyball and
the<00:01:45.780> wiffle<00:01:46.110> ball<00:01:46.290> so<00:01:47.160> there<00:01:47.460> is<00:01:47.580> an

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:47.730 
the wiffle ball so there is an

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:53.540 
the wiffle ball so there is an
anticipation<00:01:48.000> of<00:01:50.690> collision<00:01:51.690> right<00:01:52.200> so<00:01:53.010> your

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.550 
anticipation of collision right so your

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.730 
anticipation of collision right so your
body<00:01:53.880> will<00:01:54.180> naturally<00:01:54.450> brace<00:01:55.110> for<00:01:55.380> that<00:01:55.530> your

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
body will naturally brace for that your

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.860 
body will naturally brace for that your
central<00:01:56.040> nervous<00:01:56.159> system<00:01:56.490> knows<00:01:57.030> what<00:01:57.330> to<00:01:57.510> do

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:57.870 
central nervous system knows what to do

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.020 
central nervous system knows what to do
so<00:01:58.380> as<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:58.800> let<00:01:58.950> your<00:01:59.100> arm<00:01:59.220> Club<00:01:59.520> unit<00:01:59.790> fall

is<00:02:33.700> the<00:02:33.880> job<00:02:34.120> okay<00:02:34.690> so<00:02:35.290> here<00:02:35.440> we<00:02:35.530> go

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.320 

let<00:02:38.710> it<00:02:38.860> fall<00:02:39.040> through<00:02:39.310> the<00:02:39.430> ball<00:02:39.610> so<00:02:40.240> he

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
let it fall through the ball so he

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.320 
let it fall through the ball so he
noticed<00:02:40.660> now<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:42.040> golf<00:02:42.340> ball<00:02:42.610> which<00:02:43.030> is<00:02:43.060> not

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
noticed now the golf ball which is not

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:44.850 
noticed now the golf ball which is not
as<00:02:43.450> heavier<00:02:43.750> as<00:02:44.020> a<00:02:44.080> volleyball<00:02:44.650> or<00:02:44.800> a

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
as heavier as a volleyball or a

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.610 
as heavier as a volleyball or a
basketball<00:02:48.270> allows<00:02:49.270> the<00:02:49.480> club<00:02:49.660> to<00:02:49.840> go<00:02:49.990> a<00:02:50.230> lot

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
basketball allows the club to go a lot

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.310

further<00:02:50.920> into<00:02:51.400> the<00:02:51.490> follow-through<00:02:51.790> okay<00:02:52.420> so

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:53.320 
further into the follow-through okay so

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:59.010 
further into the follow-through okay so
I<00:02:53.910> hope<00:02:54.910> that<00:02:55.630> helped<00:02:56.370> you<00:02:57.370> know<00:02:57.490> marry<00:02:58.420> that

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
I hope that helped you know marry that

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.310 
I hope that helped you know marry that
the<00:02:59.320> the<00:02:59.560> picture<00:03:00.130> for<00:03:00.490> you<00:03:00.700> right<00:03:01.150> insofar<00:03:02.110> as

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
the the picture for you right insofar as

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.050 
the the picture for you right insofar as
letting<00:03:03.070> gravity<00:03:03.280> do<00:03:03.610> his<00:03:03.730> job

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
letting gravity do his job

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.000 
letting gravity do his job
if<00:03:04.600> you<00:03:04.810> don't<00:03:04.990> let<00:03:05.140> gravity<00:03:05.350> do<00:03:05.650> its<00:03:05.680> job

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
if you don't let gravity do its job

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.540 
if you don't let gravity do its job
you're<00:03:06.460> complicating<00:03:07.360> your<00:03:07.390> life<00:03:08.130> to<00:03:09.130> no<00:03:09.310> end

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
you're complicating your life to no end

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.230 
you're complicating your life to no end
okay<00:03:10.240> and<00:03:11.430> just<00:03:12.430> let<00:03:12.670> the<00:03:12.820> central<00:03:13.120> nervous

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:13.240 
okay and just let the central nervous

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.270 
okay and just let the central nervous
system<00:03:13.420> take<00:03:13.870> care<00:03:14.140> of<00:03:14.260> the<00:03:14.590> anticipate<00:03:15.100> if<00:03:15.160> I

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
system take care of the anticipate if I

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.770 
system take care of the anticipate if I
want<00:03:15.460> to<00:03:15.520> go<00:03:15.610> a<00:03:15.640> little<00:03:15.700> harder<00:03:16.000> that's<00:03:16.540> fine

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
want to go a little harder that's fine

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.970 
want to go a little harder that's fine
so<00:03:17.470> I've<00:03:17.650> got<00:03:17.860> the<00:03:18.040> arm<00:03:18.220> club<00:03:18.730> unit<00:03:19.090> falling

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
so I've got the arm club unit falling

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.860 
so I've got the arm club unit falling
it's<00:03:20.980> already<00:03:21.670> falling<00:03:22.300> in<00:03:22.390> the<00:03:22.480> proper

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
it's already falling in the proper

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.310 
it's already falling in the proper
sequence<00:03:23.080> if<00:03:23.590> I<00:03:23.770> want<00:03:24.070> to<00:03:24.190> add<00:03:24.460> it<00:03:24.970> to<00:03:25.000> that

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
sequence if I want to add it to that

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.660 
sequence if I want to add it to that
well<00:03:26.320> it's<00:03:26.470> in<00:03:26.620> the<00:03:26.680> video<00:03:27.010> that<00:03:27.280> we've<00:03:27.400> seen

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
well it's in the video that we've seen

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.030 
well it's in the video that we've seen
just<00:03:27.910> just<00:03:28.330> previously<00:03:28.960> about<00:03:29.320> the<00:03:29.380> pulling

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
just just previously about the pulling

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.570 
just just previously about the pulling
action<00:03:30.840> right<00:03:31.840> now<00:03:32.050> my<00:03:32.350> arm<00:03:32.620> club<00:03:32.950> unit<00:03:33.310> is<00:03:33.430> in

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
action right now my arm club unit is in

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.730 
action right now my arm club unit is in
a<00:03:33.670> great<00:03:33.970> position<00:03:34.240> to<00:03:34.780> pull<00:03:35.140> if<00:03:35.320> I<00:03:35.440> were<00:03:35.620> in<00:03:35.680> a

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:35.740 
a great position to pull if I were in a

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.740 
a great position to pull if I were in a
tug-of-war<00:03:35.950> I'd<00:03:36.520> be<00:03:36.700> pulling<00:03:37.000> that<00:03:37.180> club<00:03:37.600> so

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
tug-of-war I'd be pulling that club so

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.240 
tug-of-war I'd be pulling that club so
it's<00:03:37.870> like<00:03:37.960> pulling<00:03:38.290> on<00:03:38.350> a<00:03:38.410> big<00:03:38.680> church<00:03:38.950> bell

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
it's like pulling on a big church bell

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.300 
it's like pulling on a big church bell
when<00:03:40.240> do<00:03:40.480> I<00:03:40.540> assist<00:03:41.110> it's<00:03:41.440> like<00:03:41.590> pushing<00:03:41.860> a<00:03:42.100> kid

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
when do I assist it's like pushing a kid

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
when do I assist it's like pushing a kid
on<00:03:42.430> a<00:03:42.460> swing<00:03:43.560> not<00:03:44.560> at<00:03:44.710> the<00:03:44.800> top<00:03:45.010> it<00:03:45.610> starts<00:03:45.790> down

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
on a swing not at the top it starts down

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:56.900 
on a swing not at the top it starts down
then<00:03:47.320> we<00:03:47.710> apply<00:03:48.010> the<00:03:48.040> push<00:03:49.290> push<00:03:52.800> pull<00:03:55.320> pull

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
then we apply the push push pull pull

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.990 
then we apply the push push pull pull
there<00:03:57.910> we<00:03:58.030> have<00:03:58.209> it<00:03:58.390> a<00:03:59.040> momentum<00:04:00.040> gravity

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
there we have it a momentum gravity

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.680 
there we have it a momentum gravity
based<00:04:01.209> swing<00:04:03.990> that's<00:04:04.990> being<00:04:05.260> assisted

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
based swing that's being assisted

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.510 
based swing that's being assisted
through<00:04:07.690> a<00:04:07.720> pulling<00:04:08.200> action<00:04:08.620> that<00:04:09.040> is<00:04:09.220> not

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:09.520
