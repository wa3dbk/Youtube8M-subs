00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.439
 if I want more information about cookies 

00:00:09.439 --> 00:00:12.659
 the biscuits it is still a product of greed you go 

00:00:12.659 --> 00:00:13.909
 understand why 

00:00:13.909 --> 00:00:18.340
 because it's a product that is made of watermeal and leaven 

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:22.500
 like all products that look like steps or that come from the recipe of the 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.310
 bread 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.599
 and then to make it more enjoyable and because we have an enemy 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:29.460
 especially for the sweet for fat 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.600
 sugar that is a natural and fat that satisfies the taste of 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.079
 sweet that does not make us want to consume more 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:39.100
 for cement we have added in being made since the night of time 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.190
 the choice of eye cream 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.809
 sugar milk 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:47.519
 chocolate and now so much fancy is so despite ten years 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:51.309
 that we count today in French supermarkets about 630 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:53.220
 variety of cookies 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.260
 as long as you consume a cookie was not bad conscience but he 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.510
 you need to know how to consume it 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.440
 the biscuit tries a mixture of sugar butter of cream of milk 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.100
 with it the classic products to those of bread you have to know 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.100
 that in fact 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.110
 you will consume somehow a little like bread enriched with 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.540
 fat or sugar 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.730
 testing the amounts of fat and sugars that have been 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.570
 that will result the nutritional particularities of each of these biscuits 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.840
 to find you know that on average the cookies in the respect of a 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.759
 serving of about 5 to 25 grams 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:29.330
 that it is reasonable in the tale 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.290
 in consume about 30 to 50 grams per day depending on the situation 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.090
 in which we promise and in fact the average of all 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.259
 biscuits if I wanted to say it like that it's roughly speaking of valloire 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:44.460
 between 5 and if calories per gram of biscuits 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.920
 so that means it's a product you can consume when you 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.049
 do not eat eg breakfast or snack for children 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:53.320
 or snacks for women at work 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.280
 knowing that every time you consume it 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.380
 it is a product made with a little distress and a little sugar 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.010
 that every drama of products that you absorb responds to make about five 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.960
 calories sitting calories per gram 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.840
 and so you have to be modest on the ration 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.130
 today inside cookies you have two classes of cookies 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.820
 The most serious traditional methods are usually those containing 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:14.679
 chocolate 

00:02:14.679 --> 00:02:17.869
 and the leanest contrary to what everyone thinks are those who 

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:21.419
 contain sugar or jam as for example and small biscuits 

00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:25.279
 stuffed with jam we are very simple boudoirs that do not contain 

00:02:25.279 --> 00:02:26.469
 no ingredients 

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:29.629
 in opposition to those who are very rich in chocolate either because they 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:30.600
 are coated 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.859
 because they do not contain inside 

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:35.439
 and then you have a second summer disk called cookies 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:37.549
 dietetics are just cookies 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:40.750
 which one nutritional particularities one can for example be 

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:41.960
 a dietary biscuit 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.050
 because we're enriched in magnesium because we're going to put a lot of 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.670
 full grain products inside but that does not mean 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.340
 it is less caloric for only the fact of seeing on a label 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.850
 the caloric value of the biscuit 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.160
 Will allow you to know 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.910
 its amount of calories and its fat and carbohydrate content
