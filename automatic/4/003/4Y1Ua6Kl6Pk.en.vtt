 Evergreen plants are shrubs or trees with particular foliage, which remains on the plant even during periods of vegetative rest 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:41.430
 The most evergreen shrubs grown in the garden are those used for hedges, which allow to obtain a constantly compact and lush green barrier 

00:00:44.446 --> 00:00:50.446
 Despite the persistent foliage even the evergreen plants have a period of vegetative rest 

00:00:51.354 --> 00:00:58.354
 generally identifiable with the winter, during which it is advisable to suspend fertilizing and watering 

00:01:00.002 --> 00:01:06.002
 During the vegetative period, that is from March-April until September-October, we water on a regular basis 

00:01:07.515 --> 00:01:14.515
 but acting only when the soil is dry, and avoiding to keep the substrate constantly soaked with water 

00:01:15.722 --> 00:01:19.722
 in this way we will avoid the development of harmful root rots 

00:01:24.553 --> 00:01:31.553
 Fertilization can be carried out by adding fertilizer every 12-15 days to the water used for watering 

00:01:32.281 --> 00:01:39.281
 or by mixing slow release granular fertilizer to the soil at the foot of the plants, every 4-6 months 

00:01:47.933 --> 00:01:57.930
 Use a good fertilizer for green plants, rich in nitrogen during spring, and microelements, useful for keeping the foliage green and healthy. 

00:01:58.433 --> 00:02:05.430
 Place the evergreens in a good universal soil, mixed with little sand or pumice stone 

00:02:06.606 --> 00:02:14.610
 in order to avoid water stagnation; we choose a place where the shrub can enjoy good ventilation and good sunshine 

00:02:31.791 --> 00:02:38.790
 Evergreen prunings usually occur in late winter, or after flowering if they are flowering shrubs 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:47.480
 We can make small cuts to conform the shrub also during the vegetative season, or even in autumn
