can also shoot 1080p HD videos and a
very<00:02:16.570> neat<00:02:16.840> feature<00:02:17.140> of<00:02:17.410> this<00:02:17.590> camera<00:02:18.040> that<00:02:18.460> is

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
very neat feature of this camera that is

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.880 
very neat feature of this camera that is
not<00:02:18.880> really<00:02:19.210> common<00:02:19.600> is<00:02:19.870> that<00:02:19.930> one<00:02:20.410> can<00:02:20.440> zoom

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
not really common is that one can zoom

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.920 
not really common is that one can zoom
into<00:02:21.070> a<00:02:21.220> subject<00:02:21.730> while<00:02:22.150> in<00:02:22.390> with<00:02:22.570> your<00:02:22.750> moon

this helps in getting up close to

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.970 
this helps in getting up close to
objects<00:02:25.660> without<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:26.110> need<00:02:26.260> to<00:02:26.320> move<00:02:26.650> closer
