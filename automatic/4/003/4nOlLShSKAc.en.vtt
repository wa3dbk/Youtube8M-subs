00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.700
 good save all guys and welcome back in 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.190
 this new video is the fort of the 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.070
 staff of the last fifa italia team and today 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.800
 we are here with the vdc cowley team player 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.900
 of the tournament or more simply in 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.259
 shape since its card is black and i 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.270
 values ​​have been increased as it informs 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:34.110
 six matches 6 goals and two assists for him 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:35.520
 in my club and player you are 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.649
 precisely earned these towards the first 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.380
 said noemi playing very well or well 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.880
 however in the cup of Africa 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.559
 strangely I would have put gardens at 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.870
 place of chicago and in any case the place of 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.910
 some exterior quite interesting 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.410
 probably will be the only review of 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.670
 this team i said has increased that i 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.420
 interesting players really are 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:57.440
 few this player is definitely the 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.149
 its price is very low it costs 120 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.179
 130 thousand credits on playstation while up 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.880
 I don't really know xbox is a 

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:08.070
 player that I liked so so 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:11.220
 I gave him a good grade because we say 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.680
 it is only a counter but it is 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.270
 period goes to penalize a lot start 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.119
 to talk about the speed speed that you 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.820
 presents with 85 as will be general and 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.430
 it is divided with 82 acceleration 87 two 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.140
 city click I found it to be excellent 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.820
 acceleration than speed 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.079
 since it has 82 of physical strength then 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.479
 being fast, even enough 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.820
 I really physically stop him 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.610
 really hardly then thanks to that 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.950
 93 stiffness and that of equilibrium 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.350
 you will be able to do even better 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.500
 right left with speed thanks 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.299
 also to that ball control 88 then 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.070
 let's talk about the shot 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.630
 then I also liked it in part 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.009
 because surely the shot at lap 86 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.350
 the thing I liked most about his 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.119
 5-star shooting so weak 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:03.200
 so we can shoot both right and 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:06.140
 of claim 73 finalization here 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.880
 here the only one against 10 cabbages indeed 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.130
 sometimes he even scored goals 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.500
 quite beautiful arrived in front of the 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.890
 he wrote them all célèbre brava 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:19.970
 all however often and willingly 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:22.519
 wrong he was really wrong 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.980
 it pains me to say but cabbage is wrong 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:29.120
 a lot of this player in front of the 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:31.700
 brings me 3 good dribla banks the 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.349
 goalkeeper but I swear to you that even at door a 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.590
 door didn't put them inside 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:39.049
 he then took traverses put them out 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.540
 blatantly some though precisely 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:44.000
 some also put them in then a 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.799
 sometimes the finalization is very faulty 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.569
 this one probably the niqab is 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:51.349
 the only counter digital 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:53.390
 then he continues to talk about shooting with 82's 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:56.180
 launch it I tried to do some long 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.590
 short but never made me neither hot nor 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.180
 cold therefore in honor service 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.150
 network now while against since he 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.880
 however it has a good 80 positioning 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:07.010
 with medium high warcraft it will succeed 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.380
 always to be in position and therefore 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:13.190
 not being in the circumstances perhaps from 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:15.230
 out and we have 80 power shots 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:18.049
 between nadal and potentates goes wrong 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.970
 administration in the area pulled glass 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:22.970
 quite strong so I don't have nor are i 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.819
 your words 3 against since it is anyway 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.920
 a fairly normal value 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:30.319
 Then we have a value of drawing on the fly 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.569
 65 which he sincerely spent in 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:34.579
 second floor in this review given that 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:37.130
 pull the flywheel the I happened to go hungry 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:38.480
 even if mentioned like a shot of 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:41.920
 upset that 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:44.690
 we say we see that in the qualities he has 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.730
 tightrope walker seems to me in his 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.080
 features you see that every now and then 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:53.060
 always try to look for the beautiful goal 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.500
 dribbling 5 stars skill okay I have it 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.379
 said it all 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:00.290
 89 grip control for the paddle control 93 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:02.120
 agility and balance dribbling 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.629
 it is undoubtedly the characteristic 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.519
 better than chicago for what you would see has 

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:09.980
 really all if you know how to ring here 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:12.110
 go to the wedding ie I enjoyed it 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.540
 really a lot, not knowing how to ring 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:17.989
 one hundred percent since I always used 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.549
 stars up 34 skills but I have to say that 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.760
 I also learned to ring and do 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:24.320
 other schilder black cicali is the 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.710
 suitable player to learn for 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.389
 learn to ring maybe use leaf 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:31.520
 so don't spend too much and maybe 

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:33.190
 learn to ring because the 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.169
 speed helps him precisely in dribbling 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:40.789
 then we talk about the physical force 82 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:42.560
 pro absolute physics because it really is is 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:44.720
 really hard to knock it off first 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.580
 you have to take it very fast and then pay 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.169
 you have to help a game of strength 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.660
 physical and then you have to go too 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:53.210
 on balance 83 so it really will be 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.590
 difficult to throw it down even if some 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.510
 once they threw it down 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:05:00.200
 quietly but now we are not 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:01.940
 not even here to talk about it too much and then the 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.560
 header just that is an absolute 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.820
 prof 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.490
 because it is mine it took two three of 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:09.950
 head with a good elevation and one 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.240
 good accuracy precisely 71 which 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:14.120
 honestly I found them 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:16.190
 a little more then the passage also 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:19.160
 very good he was born as a second striker 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:20.930
 I used to like to tt but sincerely me 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.120
 I preferred it as an artisan just like 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:26.160
 second tip did not even try it 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:28.230
 used in an attack where he is alone 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.700
 also used in a two-way attack but it is me 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:31.860
 liked more in the attack 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.810
 single where maybe even will succeed to 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.670
 trigger the wings since it has a good one 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:38.310
 pass and can pass both right 

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:41.220
 that left however boys vote 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:42.900
 final that from eight because in the end ok 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:44.340
 finalization 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:47.040
 c is the most important thing for a 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.690
 striker in my opinion why a 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.400
 striker what to do must make goals 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:52.070
 the more you win, the more you win 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:55.410
 one goal more than the opponent 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:57.900
 so in my opinion the finalization is not 

00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:00.090
 makes him a player by maybe nine 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.560
 and a half 10 because if he had had a 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:04.440
 loyalty value around 80 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:06.210
 how I hope it can happen to pay in va 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:08.820
 towards the top four est of the world though 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:12.870
 I doubt they get big in the tops too 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:15.110
 if I don't follow the Swiss league much though 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:18.420
 they really mix our top version 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:19.920
 or in the sif version where you will go 

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:22.260
 to improve loyalty less yes 

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:24.000
 hopefully we go to raja filo gara i 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:27.180
 top are five-star driving bars 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.070
 to write quoted today is a step force 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:32.760
 physics header 5-star foot 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:35.670
 weak the flop is that often the flop 

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:37.710
 not the flops however often sins a lot 

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:39.900
 finalization because it really is a 

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:41.610
 player that if he had like I have you 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.830
 said earlier at the highest end 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:45.980
 it would have been nine and a half because it is 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:48.110
 really very complete is in my opinion 

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:49.860
 could be the ibrahimovic 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:52.440
 ibrahimovic 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:53.700
 let's face it anyway guys I hope that 

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:58.560
 you enjoyed this video 

00:06:53.700 --> 00:07:00.750
 We reach 150 by the aics for this 

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:02.430
 player who is really original and 

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:05.840
 so guys we feel in a 

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:05.840
 next video hello everyone
