that I not get the Milky Way and ya

that I not get the Milky Way and ya

once<00:02:22.980> I<00:02:23.130> saw<00:02:23.310> a<00:02:23.550> big<00:02:23.760> golden<00:02:24.120> gate<00:02:24.360> on<00:02:24.600> there<00:02:24.840> I

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
once I saw a big golden gate on there I

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.479 
once I saw a big golden gate on there I
thought<00:02:25.170> I've<00:02:25.320> got<00:02:25.500> to<00:02:25.590> get<00:02:25.739> a<00:02:25.769> golden<00:02:26.160> gate<00:02:26.340> on

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
thought I've got to get a golden gate on

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.640 
thought I've got to get a golden gate on
because<00:02:26.790> that's<00:02:27.510> the<00:02:27.690> kind<00:02:27.810> of<00:02:27.959> ice<00:02:28.110> cream<00:02:28.140> I

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
because that's the kind of ice cream I

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.800 
because that's the kind of ice cream I
like<00:02:28.950> so<00:02:29.280> I'll<00:02:29.489> know<00:02:29.760> what<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.420> difference

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
like so I'll know what the difference

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.130 
like so I'll know what the difference
will<00:02:30.989> be<00:02:31.140> if<00:02:31.320> any<00:02:31.709> between<00:02:32.430> the<00:02:33.300> ice<00:02:33.480> cream<00:02:33.930> and

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
will be if any between the ice cream and

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.600 
will be if any between the ice cream and
the<00:02:34.830> crusher<00:02:35.600> so<00:02:36.600> there's<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.410> crusher<00:02:37.950> and

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
the crusher so there's the crusher and

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.580 
the crusher so there's the crusher and
it's<00:02:38.760> cold<00:02:39.030> in<00:02:39.239> my<00:02:39.360> hand<00:02:40.820> it's<00:02:41.820> very<00:02:42.180> thick

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
it's cold in my hand it's very thick

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.880 
it's cold in my hand it's very thick
looking<00:02:43.610> very<00:02:44.610> thick<00:02:45.000> looking

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.570
