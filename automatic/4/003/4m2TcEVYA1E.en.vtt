00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.750 
of calibration this TV actually did
pretty<00:02:10.560> well<00:02:10.709> in<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.009> lab<00:02:11.190> it<00:02:11.370> doesn't<00:02:11.640> have

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
pretty well in the lab it doesn't have

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.370 
pretty well in the lab it doesn't have
quite<00:02:11.790> as<00:02:12.030> deep<00:02:12.360> a<00:02:12.450> black<00:02:12.629> level<00:02:12.989> as<00:02:13.110> some<00:02:13.230> of

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
quite as deep a black level as some of

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.530 
quite as deep a black level as some of
the<00:02:13.440> other<00:02:13.560> LED<00:02:14.070> LCD<00:02:14.280> TVs<00:02:14.850> we<00:02:15.060> compared<00:02:15.420> it

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
the other LED LCD TVs we compared it

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.180 
the other LED LCD TVs we compared it
against<00:02:15.900> but<00:02:16.110> it's<00:02:16.410> not<00:02:16.560> terrible<00:02:17.010> on<00:02:17.160> the

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
against but it's not terrible on the

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.100 
against but it's not terrible on the
plus<00:02:17.430> side<00:02:17.610> it<00:02:17.640> does<00:02:17.880> have<00:02:18.060> very<00:02:18.570> good<00:02:18.840> color

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
plus side it does have very good color

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.230 
plus side it does have very good color
accuracy<00:02:19.590> so<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.160> set<00:02:20.340> once<00:02:20.550> you<00:02:20.670> dial<00:02:20.910> it<00:02:21.090> in

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
accuracy so the set once you dial it in

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.390 
accuracy so the set once you dial it in
can<00:02:21.750> get<00:02:21.900> a<00:02:21.960> really<00:02:22.320> natural<00:02:22.770> color<00:02:23.040> that<00:02:23.130> is

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
can get a really natural color that is

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.460 
can get a really natural color that is
pretty<00:02:23.580> much<00:02:23.670> right<00:02:23.850> up<00:02:23.970> to<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.180> HD<00:02:24.510> spec<00:02:24.840> one

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470
