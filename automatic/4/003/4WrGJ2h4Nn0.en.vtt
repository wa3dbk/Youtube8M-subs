00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
it in under a little bit of pressure you

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.309 
it in under a little bit of pressure you
know<00:02:44.239> while<00:02:44.420> this<00:02:44.599> is<00:02:44.750> sitting<00:02:44.989> on<00:02:45.080> a<00:02:45.110> table

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 
know while this is sitting on a table

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:50.259 
know while this is sitting on a table
and<00:02:46.000> make<00:02:47.000> like<00:02:47.239> a<00:02:47.330> mushroom<00:02:47.920> plug<00:02:48.920> a<00:02:49.340> little

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
and make like a mushroom plug a little

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.210 
and make like a mushroom plug a little
mushroom<00:02:50.599> shaped<00:02:50.930> plug<00:02:51.319> you<00:02:51.530> know<00:02:51.560> put<00:02:51.860> put

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
mushroom shaped plug you know put put

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.180 
mushroom shaped plug you know put put
quite<00:02:52.340> a<00:02:52.400> bit<00:02:52.580> in<00:02:52.700> there<00:02:52.900> on<00:02:53.900> the<00:02:54.129> bottom<00:02:55.129> of

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
quite a bit in there on the bottom of

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.160 
quite a bit in there on the bottom of
the<00:02:55.280> pot<00:02:55.459> so<00:02:56.120> what<00:02:56.209> happens<00:02:56.540> is<00:02:56.750> when<00:02:57.140> that

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
the pot so what happens is when that

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.789 
the pot so what happens is when that
silicone<00:02:57.769> dries<00:02:58.160> it<00:02:58.819> makes<00:02:59.299> a<00:02:59.599> small<00:03:00.110> rubber

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
silicone dries it makes a small rubber

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:03.670 
silicone dries it makes a small rubber
plug<00:03:01.220> that<00:03:01.970> can't<00:03:02.360> be<00:03:02.780> pushed<00:03:03.019> out<00:03:03.230> the<00:03:03.260> bottom

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
plug that can't be pushed out the bottom

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.680 
plug that can't be pushed out the bottom
and<00:03:03.860> it's<00:03:04.340> also<00:03:04.519> got<00:03:04.760> the<00:03:04.880> metal<00:03:05.120> disc<00:03:05.269> holding

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
and it's also got the metal disc holding

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.440 
and it's also got the metal disc holding
it<00:03:05.780> in<00:03:05.900> place<00:03:06.049> from<00:03:06.349> the<00:03:06.470> outside<00:03:07.060> so<00:03:08.060> these

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
it in place from the outside so these

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.089 
it in place from the outside so these
discs<00:03:08.840> come<00:03:09.049> in<00:03:09.170> really<00:03:09.319> handy<00:03:09.410> for<00:03:09.890> a<00:03:09.920> lot<00:03:09.980> of

we're going to be using a 7/16 drill bit

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:15.490 
we're going to be using a 7/16 drill bit
to<00:04:13.700> punch<00:04:14.150> that<00:04:14.329> hole<00:04:14.510> through<00:04:14.720> you<00:04:15.200> could<00:04:15.349> use

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
to punch that hole through you could use

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.259 
to punch that hole through you could use
a<00:04:15.530> really<00:04:15.799> large<00:04:16.130> nail<00:04:16.400> something<00:04:16.789> over<00:04:17.239> a

out<00:04:36.440> and<00:04:36.880> you<00:04:37.880> only<00:04:38.030> need<00:04:38.240> a<00:04:38.300> little<00:04:38.330> bit<00:04:38.599> stick

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
out and you only need a little bit stick

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.030 
out and you only need a little bit stick
what<00:04:41.840> you're<00:04:41.990> going<00:04:42.170> to<00:04:42.260> do<00:04:42.380> is<00:04:42.560> you're<00:04:42.950> going

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
what you're going to do is you're going

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.520 
what you're going to do is you're going
to<00:04:43.100> use<00:04:43.280> silicone<00:04:43.820> on<00:04:43.970> the<00:04:44.000> inside<00:04:44.600> cover<00:04:45.320> the

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
to use silicone on the inside cover the

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.040 
to use silicone on the inside cover the
whole<00:04:45.650> plate<00:04:45.950> and<00:04:46.280> put<00:04:47.270> some<00:04:47.450> around<00:04:47.660> there<00:04:47.900> to

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
whole plate and put some around there to

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.980 
whole plate and put some around there to
seal<00:04:49.000> then<00:04:50.000> on<00:04:50.150> the<00:04:50.270> topside

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
seal then on the topside

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.040 
seal then on the topside
I<00:04:51.020> would<00:04:51.410> suggest<00:04:52.210> wetting<00:04:53.210> it<00:04:53.360> slightly<00:04:53.720> and

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:54.050 
I would suggest wetting it slightly and

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.230 
I would suggest wetting it slightly and
then<00:04:54.470> using<00:04:54.830> Gorilla<00:04:55.220> Glue<00:04:55.490> like<00:04:55.760> I<00:04:55.880> did<00:04:56.060> over

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
then using Gorilla Glue like I did over

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.470 
then using Gorilla Glue like I did over
here

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:56.480 
here

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.820 
here

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
the Gorilla Glue will harden overnight

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:02.110 
the Gorilla Glue will harden overnight
turns<00:05:00.830> yellow<00:05:01.100> and<00:05:01.400> kind<00:05:01.610> of<00:05:01.640> bubbly<00:05:02.000> like

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
turns yellow and kind of bubbly like

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.890

that<00:05:02.360> but<00:05:03.110> it's<00:05:03.560> really<00:05:03.860> strong<00:05:04.450> you<00:05:05.450> can't

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
that but it's really strong you can't

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.780 
that but it's really strong you can't
pull<00:05:06.080> the<00:05:06.200> disc<00:05:06.380> off<00:05:06.560> any<00:05:06.770> more<00:05:06.980> it'll<00:05:07.280> it'll

pull the disc off any more it'll it'll

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:09.700 
pull the disc off any more it'll it'll
withstand<00:05:08.060> you<00:05:08.540> actually<00:05:09.020> pulling<00:05:09.440> on<00:05:09.560> these

withstand you actually pulling on these
to<00:05:09.950> take<00:05:10.340> them<00:05:10.490> out<00:05:10.580> of<00:05:10.610> the<00:05:10.760> dirt<00:05:10.910> that<00:05:11.120> way<00:05:11.300> if

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 
to take them out of the dirt that way if

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.700 
to take them out of the dirt that way if
you<00:05:11.540> want<00:05:11.720> so<00:05:12.350> that's<00:05:13.130> what<00:05:13.280> I<00:05:13.310> would<00:05:13.400> suggest

that fully dry then go ahead and you

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:26.020 
that fully dry then go ahead and you
know<00:05:22.820> coat<00:05:23.180> the<00:05:23.330> disc<00:05:24.370> put<00:05:25.370> another<00:05:25.610> big<00:05:25.850> bead

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
know coat the disc put another big bead

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:27.880 
know coat the disc put another big bead
of<00:05:26.150> silicone<00:05:26.270> on<00:05:26.660> the<00:05:26.780> bottom<00:05:27.050> stick<00:05:27.650> it<00:05:27.770> in

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:27.890 
of silicone on the bottom stick it in

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:31.600 
of silicone on the bottom stick it in
there<00:05:28.070> and<00:05:29.320> smear<00:05:30.320> it<00:05:30.410> all<00:05:30.470> around<00:05:30.770> so<00:05:31.520> it

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
there and smear it all around so it

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.730 
there and smear it all around so it
makes<00:05:31.790> a<00:05:31.880> nice<00:05:32.000> tight<00:05:32.300> seal<00:05:32.810> on<00:05:32.840> there<00:05:33.200> the

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 
makes a nice tight seal on there the

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.490 
makes a nice tight seal on there the
silicone<00:05:33.920> itself<00:05:34.580> will<00:05:35.360> bond<00:05:35.600> to<00:05:35.840> the<00:05:35.960> pot<00:05:36.140> and

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500 
silicone itself will bond to the pot and

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.830 
silicone itself will bond to the pot and
does<00:05:37.130> a<00:05:37.160> real<00:05:37.340> good<00:05:37.370> job<00:05:37.580> he<00:05:38.450> doesn't<00:05:38.690> want<00:05:38.810> to

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:38.840 
does a real good job he doesn't want to

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.140 
does a real good job he doesn't want to
come<00:05:38.990> out<00:05:39.140> but<00:05:39.620> the<00:05:39.890> hose<00:05:40.100> has<00:05:40.670> a<00:05:40.730> little<00:05:41.000> bit

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.150 
come out but the hose has a little bit

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:42.460 
come out but the hose has a little bit
of<00:05:41.240> trouble<00:05:41.480> with<00:05:41.510> the<00:05:41.630> metal<00:05:41.930> disc<00:05:42.080> it<00:05:42.320> always

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:42.470 
of trouble with the metal disc it always

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:44.530 
of trouble with the metal disc it always
wants<00:05:42.830> to<00:05:42.980> slip<00:05:43.280> a<00:05:43.310> little<00:05:43.460> bit<00:05:43.670> so<00:05:43.850> the<00:05:44.300> little

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:44.540 
wants to slip a little bit so the little

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.000 
wants to slip a little bit so the little
blob<00:05:44.720> of<00:05:44.750> gorilla<00:05:45.080> glue<00:05:45.350> works<00:05:45.500> pretty<00:05:45.830> good

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.010 
blob of gorilla glue works pretty good

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:48.610 
blob of gorilla glue works pretty good
or<00:05:47.000> if<00:05:47.420> you've<00:05:47.690> done<00:05:47.870> a<00:05:47.900> good<00:05:48.050> enough<00:05:48.110> job<00:05:48.290> on

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:48.620 
or if you've done a good enough job on

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.190 
or if you've done a good enough job on
the<00:05:48.740> hole<00:05:48.890> and<00:05:49.100> it's<00:05:49.220> real<00:05:49.550> real<00:05:49.760> tight

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:50.200 
the hole and it's real real tight

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.320 
the hole and it's real real tight
silicone<00:05:51.200> might<00:05:51.440> do<00:05:51.650> it<00:05:51.800> but<00:05:52.280> I<00:05:52.490> like<00:05:53.150> to<00:05:53.240> have

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.330 
silicone might do it but I like to have

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:54.730 
silicone might do it but I like to have
the<00:05:53.480> little<00:05:53.750> extra<00:05:54.170> insurance<00:05:54.290> of<00:05:54.710> the

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:54.740 
the little extra insurance of the

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.940 
the little extra insurance of the
gorilla<00:05:55.010> glue<00:05:55.330> so<00:05:56.330> all<00:05:56.510> you<00:05:56.630> do<00:05:56.750> is<00:05:56.920> grab<00:05:57.920> a

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:57.950 
gorilla glue so all you do is grab a

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:00.660 
gorilla glue so all you do is grab a
disc<00:05:58.480> with<00:05:59.480> a<00:05:59.570> nice<00:05:59.720> pair<00:05:59.900> of<00:05:59.990> vise<00:06:00.140> grips

a 7/16 drill bit through then take your
7/16<00:06:09.740> drill<00:06:10.160> and<00:06:10.400> just<00:06:11.500> wobble<00:06:12.500> it<00:06:12.620> a<00:06:12.740> little

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:13.190 
7/16 drill and just wobble it a little

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:16.450 
7/16 drill and just wobble it a little
bit<00:06:13.400> and<00:06:13.750> it'll<00:06:14.750> fit<00:06:15.050> the<00:06:15.170> hose<00:06:15.350> better<00:06:16.100> this

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:16.460 
bit and it'll fit the hose better this

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.210 
bit and it'll fit the hose better this
is<00:06:16.610> dig<00:06:16.820> brand<00:06:17.150> hose<00:06:17.420> so<00:06:17.720> it<00:06:17.930> just<00:06:18.920> needs<00:06:19.100> a

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:19.220 
is dig brand hose so it just needs a

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.600 
is dig brand hose so it just needs a
little<00:06:19.430> bit<00:06:19.760> over<00:06:20.060> 7/16<00:06:21.130> to<00:06:22.130> get<00:06:22.280> it<00:06:22.370> to<00:06:22.490> fit

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:22.610 
little bit over 7/16 to get it to fit

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:29.500 
little bit over 7/16 to get it to fit
tight<00:06:22.880> so<00:06:27.790> then<00:06:28.790> while<00:06:29.000> you<00:06:29.120> still<00:06:29.300> have<00:06:29.360> it

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:29.510 
tight so then while you still have it

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:31.870 
tight so then while you still have it
clamped<00:06:30.010> go<00:06:31.010> ahead<00:06:31.130> and<00:06:31.250> put<00:06:31.370> your<00:06:31.400> hose<00:06:31.670> in
