weights on the back wheel this front

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.600 
weights on the back wheel this front
wheel<00:01:03.420> there's<00:01:03.629> nothing<00:01:03.960> but<00:01:04.110> about<00:01:04.369> if<00:01:05.369> you

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
pulls the front wheel up so there's a

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.030 
pulls the front wheel up so there's a
little<00:01:15.659> bump<00:01:15.869> coming<00:01:16.200> up<00:01:16.439> I'll<00:01:16.619> just<00:01:16.799> kind<00:01:17.009> of

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
little bump coming up I'll just kind of

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.950 
little bump coming up I'll just kind of
go<00:01:17.159> like<00:01:17.189> that<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.640> get<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.299> front<00:01:18.509> wheel<00:01:18.600> why

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
go like that and get the front wheel why

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.410 
go like that and get the front wheel why
not<00:01:19.259> okay<00:01:19.590> now<00:01:20.159> if<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.460> see<00:01:20.640> this<00:01:20.759> spring<00:01:21.090> here

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
not okay now if you see this spring here

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.270 
not okay now if you see this spring here
spring<00:01:22.020> mechanism<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.770> seat

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
spring mechanism the seat

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:30.410 
spring mechanism the seat
it's<00:01:23.939> got<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.119> fair<00:01:24.390> amount<00:01:24.479> of<00:01:28.009> so<00:01:29.299> because<00:01:30.299> it

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
it's got a fair amount of so because it

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.120 
it's got a fair amount of so because it
sounds<00:01:30.689> you<00:01:31.110> know<00:01:31.200> attention<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.740> saddles

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
sounds you know attention the saddles

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:39.210 
sounds you know attention the saddles
like<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.900> sling<00:01:33.930> really

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.010 

that's<00:01:40.220> cowhide<00:01:40.640> not<00:01:41.270> something<00:01:41.659> meats<00:01:41.810> go

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
that's cowhide not something meats go

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:49.030 
that's cowhide not something meats go
outside<00:01:42.759> so<00:01:44.259> you<00:01:45.259> know<00:01:45.350> that's<00:01:45.500> that<00:01:45.799> a<00:01:48.040> while

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
outside so you know that's that a while

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.550 
outside so you know that's that a while
I<00:01:49.490> was<00:01:49.729> able<00:01:49.880> to<00:01:50.119> replicate<00:01:50.659> a<00:01:50.990> lot<00:01:51.259> of<00:01:51.350> things

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
I was able to replicate a lot of things

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.940 
I was able to replicate a lot of things
pretty<00:01:51.830> well<00:01:52.009> on<00:01:52.159> it<00:01:53.470> there<00:01:54.470> are<00:01:54.560> some<00:01:54.740> things

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
pretty well on it there are some things

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.090 
pretty well on it there are some things
you<00:01:55.070> just<00:01:55.100> you<00:01:55.460> just<00:01:55.490> did<00:01:56.500> this<00:01:57.500> folks<00:01:57.830> and

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
you just you just did this folks and

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.800 
you just you just did this folks and
such<00:01:58.250> I<00:01:58.399> mean<00:01:58.430> you<00:01:58.700> you<00:01:58.880> can<00:01:59.060> fix<00:01:59.299> them<00:01:59.450> but<00:01:59.659> if

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
such I mean you you can fix them but if

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.030 
such I mean you you can fix them but if
you<00:01:59.960> if<00:02:00.200> you<00:02:00.320> really<00:02:00.619> screwed<00:02:00.920> up<00:02:01.100> it<00:02:01.250> takes<00:02:01.820> um
