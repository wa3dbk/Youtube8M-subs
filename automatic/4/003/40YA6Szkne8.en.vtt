00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
might have to come a little bit closer

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.360 
might have to come a little bit closer
this<00:02:38.850> tree<00:02:39.270> has<00:02:39.540> a<00:02:39.960> similar<00:02:40.470> sort<00:02:41.010> of<00:02:41.160> leaf

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
this tree has a similar sort of leaf

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.510 
this tree has a similar sort of leaf
structure<00:02:41.850> to<00:02:42.240> the<00:02:42.270> sumac<00:02:42.930> and<00:02:43.280> this<00:02:44.280> one

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
structure to the sumac and this one

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.280 
structure to the sumac and this one
would<00:02:44.700> be<00:02:44.730> a<00:02:44.850> really<00:02:45.060> good<00:02:45.270> indicator<00:02:45.750> here

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
would be a really good indicator here

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.890 
would be a really good indicator here
this<00:02:46.890> is<00:02:47.100> elderberry<00:02:47.580> and<00:02:48.000> you<00:02:48.480> can<00:02:48.630> see<00:02:48.810> this

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
this is elderberry and you can see this

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.660 
this is elderberry and you can see this

then these little green berries in the

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.530 
then these little green berries in the
middle<00:02:52.320> here's<00:02:53.310> just<00:02:53.670> a<00:02:53.790> whole<00:02:53.970> cluster<00:02:54.510> of

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
these get a little bit bigger than this

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.480 
these get a little bit bigger than this
but<00:03:03.210> not<00:03:03.420> too<00:03:03.690> much<00:03:03.720> bigger<00:03:04.140> and<00:03:04.490> they're
