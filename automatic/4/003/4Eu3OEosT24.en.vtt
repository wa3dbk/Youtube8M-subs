00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
need to be told to maybe get some action

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.620 
need to be told to maybe get some action
to<00:02:58.170> maybe<00:02:58.680> do<00:02:59.310> things<00:02:59.580> that<00:02:59.760> would<00:03:00.030> be<00:03:00.209> able<00:03:00.330> to

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.530 
to maybe do things that would be able to
stop<00:03:00.900> these<00:03:01.709> shooters<00:03:02.160> going<00:03:02.610> forward<00:03:03.060> now

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
but this new senseless violence

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:29.449 
but this new senseless violence
phenomenon<00:03:26.070> is<00:03:26.340> entirely<00:03:27.030> new<00:03:27.799> the<00:03:28.799> idea<00:03:28.829> that

you're<00:03:29.610> never<00:03:30.000> safe<00:03:30.390> I<00:03:30.720> mean<00:03:30.930> that's<00:03:31.290> quite

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
you're never safe I mean that's quite

terrifying you know we've heard a lot of

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.110 
terrifying you know we've heard a lot of
also<00:03:33.829> headlines<00:03:34.829> obviously<00:03:35.430> in<00:03:35.549> Ferguson

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
also headlines obviously in Ferguson

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.050 
also headlines obviously in Ferguson
about<00:03:36.329> Michael<00:03:36.690> Brown<00:03:36.920> and<00:03:37.920> you<00:03:38.400> know<00:03:38.519> there's

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
about Michael Brown and you know there's

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.330 
about Michael Brown and you know there's
a<00:03:39.150> lot<00:03:39.420> of<00:03:39.570> stories<00:03:39.959> about<00:03:39.989> how<00:03:40.530> that<00:03:41.040> stuff

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
a lot of stories about how that stuff

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.490 
a lot of stories about how that stuff
goes<00:03:41.579> down<00:03:41.610> but<00:03:42.299> I<00:03:42.329> think<00:03:42.600> again<00:03:42.840> not<00:03:43.200> enough

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
goes down but I think again not enough

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.009 
goes down but I think again not enough
attention<00:03:44.010> is<00:03:44.100> paid<00:03:44.310> to<00:03:44.390> you<00:03:45.390> know<00:03:45.510> the<00:03:45.630> family

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
attention is paid to you know the family

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.380 
attention is paid to you know the family
of<00:03:46.140> Michael<00:03:46.320> Brown<00:03:46.709> and<00:03:47.640> perhaps<00:03:48.090> we'll<00:03:48.360> see

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
of Michael Brown and perhaps we'll see

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.180 
of Michael Brown and perhaps we'll see
some<00:03:48.870> filmmakers<00:03:49.380> do<00:03:49.590> that<00:03:49.769> I<00:03:49.799> mean<00:03:49.920> we<00:03:50.040> had<00:03:50.160> a

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
some filmmakers do that I mean we had a

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.680 
some filmmakers do that I mean we had a
Fruitvale<00:03:50.579> station<00:03:50.609> which<00:03:51.239> I<00:03:51.359> thought<00:03:51.540> was

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
Fruitvale station which I thought was

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.310 
Fruitvale station which I thought was
very<00:03:51.900> very<00:03:52.470> very<00:03:53.100> effective<00:03:53.989> but<00:03:54.989> again<00:03:55.200> it

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
very very very effective but again it

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.160 
very very very effective but again it
focused<00:03:55.739> on<00:03:55.890> the<00:03:56.130> victim<00:03:57.030> not<00:03:57.299> those<00:03:57.900> that

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
focused on the victim not those that

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:59.930 
focused on the victim not those that
were<00:03:58.260> left<00:03:58.470> behind<00:03:58.650> and<00:03:59.070> I<00:03:59.160> think<00:03:59.609> that<00:03:59.790> this

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
were left behind and I think that this

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.180 
were left behind and I think that this
is<00:04:00.180> an<00:04:00.299> important<00:04:00.780> story<00:04:01.019> to<00:04:01.170> tell<00:04:01.560> and<00:04:01.829> I'm

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
is an important story to tell and I'm

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:03.710 
is an important story to tell and I'm
glad<00:04:02.489> this<00:04:02.730> is<00:04:02.790> one<00:04:03.030> of<00:04:03.060> the<00:04:03.209> reasons<00:04:03.540> you<00:04:03.630> know

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
glad this is one of the reasons you know

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.300 
glad this is one of the reasons you know
recently<00:04:04.109> somebody<00:04:04.440> asked<00:04:04.709> me<00:04:04.769> about<00:04:05.070> camp

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
recently somebody asked me about camp

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.240 
recently somebody asked me about camp

x-ray one of you asked me you know our
documentary<00:04:09.120> is<00:04:09.269> more<00:04:09.450> effective<00:04:09.930> when

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109 
documentary is more effective when

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:11.780 
documentary is more effective when
trying<00:04:10.410> to<00:04:10.470> affect<00:04:10.829> social<00:04:11.100> change<00:04:11.280> and<00:04:11.730> I

said you know sugar makes the medicine
go<00:04:13.739> down<00:04:13.769> in<00:04:14.100> a<00:04:14.220> narrative<00:04:14.489> film<00:04:14.970> even<00:04:15.239> when

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
go down in a narrative film even when

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.110 
go down in a narrative film even when
it's<00:04:15.540> hard<00:04:15.750> to<00:04:15.810> watch<00:04:16.049> is<00:04:16.440> still<00:04:16.890> somewhat<00:04:17.760> the

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
it's hard to watch is still somewhat the

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.539 
it's hard to watch is still somewhat the
sugar<00:04:18.390> and<00:04:19.289> so<00:04:19.500> you<00:04:19.560> see<00:04:19.859> I<00:04:19.890> think<00:04:20.010> narrative

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
sugar and so you see I think narrative

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.310 
sugar and so you see I think narrative
in<00:04:20.700> a<00:04:20.880> documentary<00:04:21.209> obviously<00:04:21.900> could<00:04:22.049> be<00:04:22.079> made

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
in a documentary obviously could be made

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.770 
in a documentary obviously could be made
about<00:04:22.490> you<00:04:23.490> know<00:04:23.580> families<00:04:24.150> of<00:04:24.330> victims<00:04:24.419> of

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
about you know families of victims of

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.540 
about you know families of victims of
senseless<00:04:24.990> violence<00:04:25.410> but<00:04:25.770> I<00:04:26.070> think<00:04:26.460> a

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
senseless violence but I think a

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:27.830 
senseless violence but I think a
narrative<00:04:26.910> film<00:04:27.150> is<00:04:27.360> something<00:04:27.600> they'll<00:04:27.720> have

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
narrative film is something they'll have

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.200 
narrative film is something they'll have
a<00:04:27.870> wider<00:04:28.200> audience<00:04:28.770> and<00:04:29.610> kind<00:04:29.880> of<00:04:29.970> you<00:04:30.090> know

I'm<00:04:36.340> going<00:04:36.730> to<00:04:36.820> go<00:04:36.910> watch<00:04:37.090> this<00:04:37.270> movie<00:04:37.570> and

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
I'm going to go watch this movie and

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.110 
I'm going to go watch this movie and
then<00:04:37.810> as<00:04:38.020> you<00:04:38.530> watch<00:04:38.710> it<00:04:38.740> you<00:04:39.400> begin<00:04:39.610> to<00:04:39.940> get

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
then as you watch it you begin to get

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.330 
then as you watch it you begin to get
the<00:04:40.270> message<00:04:40.660> and<00:04:40.930> sometimes<00:04:41.710> these<00:04:42.070> are<00:04:42.130> the

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
the message and sometimes these are the

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.510 
the message and sometimes these are the
most<00:04:42.550> persuasive<00:04:43.180> arguments<00:04:44.020> and<00:04:44.170> in<00:04:44.410> a<00:04:44.830> piece

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
most persuasive arguments and in a piece

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.940 
most persuasive arguments and in a piece
of<00:04:45.700> fictional<00:04:46.150> work<00:04:46.720> and<00:04:47.410> I<00:04:47.470> think<00:04:47.710> this<00:04:47.830> is

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
of fictional work and I think this is

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:49.350 
of fictional work and I think this is
going<00:04:48.070> to<00:04:48.130> be<00:04:48.280> difficult<00:04:48.730> to<00:04:48.760> watch<00:04:49.000> at<00:04:49.210> some

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
going to be difficult to watch at some

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.570 
going to be difficult to watch at some
points<00:04:49.690> I<00:04:49.750> mean<00:04:49.870> I<00:04:49.960> I<00:04:50.230> can<00:04:50.830> imagine<00:04:51.040> that<00:04:51.280> Billy

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
points I mean I I can imagine that Billy

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:52.980 
points I mean I I can imagine that Billy
Crudup<00:04:51.850> scare<00:04:52.240> achter<00:04:52.420> is<00:04:52.540> going<00:04:52.750> to<00:04:52.840> feel

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:45.970 
that it's not it's not wimpier

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.240 
that it's not it's not wimpier
you<00:05:46.240> know<00:05:46.360> it's<00:05:46.690> not<00:05:46.870> you're<00:05:47.560> not<00:05:47.680> a<00:05:47.710> wuss<00:05:47.980> if

don't yet have children to to maybe

00:05:56.410 --> 00:05:58.890 
don't yet have children to to maybe
think<00:05:56.890> of<00:05:57.310> that<00:05:57.550> themselves<00:05:58.300> in<00:05:58.420> that<00:05:58.450> way<00:05:58.570> be

father<00:06:18.970> I<00:06:19.480> think<00:06:19.750> that<00:06:19.870> movies<00:06:20.380> are<00:06:20.530> also

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:20.650 
father I think that movies are also

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:22.470 
father I think that movies are also
effective<00:06:21.190> in<00:06:21.280> that<00:06:21.340> regard<00:06:21.460> so<00:06:22.240> I<00:06:22.270> think

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:22.480 
effective in that regard so I think

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:23.640 
effective in that regard so I think
there's<00:06:22.600> a<00:06:22.690> lot<00:06:22.930> of<00:06:23.080> good<00:06:23.230> stuff<00:06:23.440> in<00:06:23.590> this

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:23.650 
there's a lot of good stuff in this
