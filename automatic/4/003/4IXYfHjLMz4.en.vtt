to slide it in well or to finesse it and
yeah<00:01:40.619> he<00:01:40.829> always<00:01:41.070> gets<00:01:41.460> through<00:01:41.670> and

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
yeah he always gets through and

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.090 
yeah he always gets through and
obviously<00:01:41.939> he<00:01:42.360> is<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.509> very<00:01:43.259> high<00:01:43.500> jumper<00:01:43.950> with

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
obviously he is a very high jumper with

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.240 
obviously he is a very high jumper with
crazy<00:01:44.610> crazy<00:01:45.299> power<00:01:45.689> header<00:01:46.170> he's<00:01:46.619> always<00:01:47.130> up

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
crazy crazy power header he's always up

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.100 
crazy crazy power header he's always up
the<00:01:47.520> field<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.090> he<00:01:48.180> has<00:01:48.299> a<00:01:48.329> high<00:01:48.720> attacking

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110

the field and he has a high attacking
work<00:01:49.229> rate<00:01:49.380> so<00:01:49.500> yeah<00:01:49.649> that<00:01:49.829> shows<00:01:50.100> he's

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
if you look at the stats on this card

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:17.229 
if you look at the stats on this card
they<00:03:13.700> are<00:03:13.870> incredible<00:03:14.920> 87<00:03:15.920> pace<00:03:16.190> 87<00:03:16.910> shooting

88 dribbling in 82 passing theirs
overall<00:03:20.810> should<00:03:21.350> be<00:03:21.650> much<00:03:22.010> better<00:03:22.340> than<00:03:22.549> 85

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:23.239 
overall should be much better than 85

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:25.240 
overall should be much better than 85
but<00:03:23.570> forever<00:03:23.930> reason<00:03:24.410> it's<00:03:24.560> probably<00:03:25.040> cuz<00:03:25.160> of

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
but forever reason it's probably cuz of

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.430 
but forever reason it's probably cuz of
defending<00:03:25.790> and<00:03:25.910> heading<00:03:26.209> it's<00:03:26.660> not<00:03:26.959> but

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
defending and heading it's not but

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.280 
defending and heading it's not but
anyways<00:03:27.920> he's<00:03:28.250> also<00:03:28.640> probably<00:03:29.120> the<00:03:29.570> most
