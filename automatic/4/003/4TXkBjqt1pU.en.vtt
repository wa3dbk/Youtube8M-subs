this year the first thing that we're

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.470 
this year the first thing that we're
doing<00:00:07.740> right<00:00:07.919> now<00:00:07.980> down<00:00:08.550> in<00:00:08.760> the<00:00:08.790> basement<00:00:09.389> is

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
doing right now down in the basement is

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.690 
doing right now down in the basement is
starting<00:00:10.019> our<00:00:10.170> seeds<00:00:10.530> and<00:00:10.860> I'm<00:00:11.340> going<00:00:11.519> to<00:00:11.550> give

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
starting our seeds and I'm going to give

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.520 
starting our seeds and I'm going to give
you<00:00:11.849> sort<00:00:12.030> of<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.179> basic<00:00:12.630> tips<00:00:12.870> right<00:00:13.259> now

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
you sort of the basic tips right now

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.129 
you sort of the basic tips right now
first<00:00:13.980> thing<00:00:14.280> you're<00:00:14.820> using<00:00:15.000> a<00:00:15.210> soilless<00:00:15.750> mix

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
first thing you're using a soilless mix

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.769 
first thing you're using a soilless mix
in<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.619> in<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:17.039> containers<00:00:17.640> and<00:00:17.850> you<00:00:18.300> gently

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
in the in the containers and you gently

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.929 
in the in the containers and you gently
firm<00:00:19.230> with<00:00:19.500> your<00:00:19.680> finger<00:00:20.039> very<00:00:20.070> gently

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
firm with your finger very gently

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:23.390 
firm with your finger very gently
because<00:00:21.390> what<00:00:21.689> we<00:00:21.900> want<00:00:22.260> to<00:00:22.350> do<00:00:22.650> is<00:00:22.890> to

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
because what we want to do is to

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.210 
because what we want to do is to
eliminate<00:00:23.670> all<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.720> little<00:00:25.170> spaces<00:00:25.680> and

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
eliminate all the little spaces and

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.120 
eliminate all the little spaces and
cracks<00:00:26.550> in<00:00:26.880> that<00:00:27.359> soil<00:00:27.869> so<00:00:28.560> that<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.890> seeds

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
cracks in that soil so that the seeds

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.220 
cracks in that soil so that the seeds
don't<00:00:29.400> get<00:00:29.699> down<00:00:29.880> too<00:00:30.210> deeply<00:00:30.630> because<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.869> seed

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
don't get down too deeply because a seed

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.650 
don't get down too deeply because a seed
that's<00:00:31.439> planted<00:00:31.529> deeply<00:00:32.369> is<00:00:32.550> just<00:00:32.820> not<00:00:33.180> going

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
that's planted deeply is just not going

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.260 
that's planted deeply is just not going
to<00:00:33.809> germinate<00:00:34.380> quickly<00:00:34.410> or<00:00:35.250> at<00:00:35.700> all<00:00:35.969> it'll

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
to germinate quickly or at all it'll

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.479 
to germinate quickly or at all it'll
just<00:00:36.510> die<00:00:36.870> second<00:00:37.860> thing<00:00:37.980> we're<00:00:38.129> going<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.309> do

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
just die second thing we're going to do

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:45.160 
just die second thing we're going to do
is<00:00:39.440> take<00:00:40.440> our<00:00:40.620> seeds<00:00:41.870> and<00:00:43.100> try<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.160> spread<00:00:44.670> them

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
is take our seeds and try to spread them

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:51.590 
is take our seeds and try to spread them
far<00:00:46.170> enough<00:00:46.440> apart<00:00:46.680> on<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.940> seed<00:00:49.640> soil<00:00:50.640> so

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
far enough apart on the seed soil so

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.299 
far enough apart on the seed soil so
that<00:00:51.960> they<00:00:52.230> when<00:00:52.559> they<00:00:52.680> start<00:00:53.010> growing

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
that they when they start growing

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.279 
that they when they start growing
they're<00:00:53.640> not<00:00:53.789> all<00:00:53.969> clumped<00:00:54.570> together<00:00:54.660> because

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
they're not all clumped together because

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.990 
they're not all clumped together because
when<00:00:55.500> they're<00:00:55.680> clumped<00:00:56.039> together<00:00:56.129> too

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
when they're clumped together too

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.209 
when they're clumped together too
closely<00:00:57.420> is<00:00:57.870> when<00:00:58.469> you're<00:00:58.680> going<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:59.039> have

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
closely is when you're going to have

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.740 
closely is when you're going to have
problems<00:00:59.730> you're<00:00:59.910> going<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.149> have<00:01:00.270> fungus

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
problems you're going to have fungus

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.049 
problems you're going to have fungus
problems<00:01:01.320> get<00:01:01.559> in<00:01:01.590> there<00:01:01.949> so<00:01:02.430> what<00:01:02.609> we<00:01:02.760> try<00:01:03.000> to

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
problems get in there so what we try to

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.969 
problems get in there so what we try to
do<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.629> then<00:01:03.750> we<00:01:03.870> just<00:01:04.049> save<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.530> seed<00:01:04.769> from

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
do and then we just save the seed from

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.560 
do and then we just save the seed from
year<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.339> year<00:01:05.369> by<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.790> way<00:01:05.939> that's<00:01:06.270> with

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
year to year by the way that's with

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.080 
year to year by the way that's with
those<00:01:06.900> big<00:01:07.200> seed<00:01:07.500> wraps<00:01:07.740> up<00:01:08.010> there<00:01:08.250> boxes<00:01:08.970> up

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
those big seed wraps up there boxes up

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.620 
those big seed wraps up there boxes up
there<00:01:09.119> for<00:01:09.600> so<00:01:10.380> we<00:01:10.560> saved<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.070> seed<00:01:11.340> we<00:01:12.270> put<00:01:12.510> it

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
there for so we saved the seed we put it

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.210 
there for so we saved the seed we put it
in<00:01:12.780> now<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.020> next<00:01:13.380> thing<00:01:13.500> we're<00:01:13.680> going<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.950> do

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
in now the next thing we're going to do

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.940 
in now the next thing we're going to do
is<00:01:14.729> cover<00:01:15.240> it<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.630> this<00:01:16.229> is<00:01:16.409> where<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.590> lot<00:01:16.920> of

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
is cover it and this is where a lot of

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.460 
is cover it and this is where a lot of
folks<00:01:17.250> make<00:01:17.490> problems<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.570> only<00:01:19.049> reason

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
folks make problems the only reason

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.920 
folks make problems the only reason
we're<00:01:19.619> going<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.890> cover<00:01:20.100> our<00:01:20.369> seeds<00:01:20.729> is<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.360> to

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
we're going to cover our seeds is to to

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.800 
we're going to cover our seeds is to to
maintain<00:01:22.200> a<00:01:22.530> even<00:01:23.310> moisture<00:01:23.580> level<00:01:24.180> at<00:01:24.330> the

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
maintain a even moisture level at the

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.990 
maintain a even moisture level at the
seed<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.350> seed<00:01:25.560> doesn't<00:01:25.770> need<00:01:26.130> dark<00:01:26.610> to

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
seed the seed doesn't need dark to

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.469 
seed the seed doesn't need dark to
germinate<00:01:27.509> it<00:01:27.750> likes<00:01:28.619> fine<00:01:28.860> darks<00:01:29.640> fine<00:01:29.880> but

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
germinate it likes fine darks fine but

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.530 
germinate it likes fine darks fine but
what<00:01:30.659> we<00:01:30.810> have<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.140> do<00:01:31.290> is<00:01:31.530> maintain<00:01:31.770> an<00:01:32.159> even

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
what we have to do is maintain an even

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.730 
what we have to do is maintain an even
soil<00:01:33.540> moisture<00:01:34.020> so<00:01:34.500> we<00:01:34.710> very<00:01:35.400> very<00:01:35.780> gently<00:01:36.780> add

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
soil moisture so we very very gently add

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.429 
soil moisture so we very very gently add
a<00:01:37.799> bit<00:01:38.189> of<00:01:38.220> soil<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.329> top<00:01:39.689> you<00:01:39.900> can<00:01:40.110> see<00:01:40.320> I'm

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
a bit of soil to the top you can see I'm

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.740 
a bit of soil to the top you can see I'm
not<00:01:40.740> adding<00:01:41.250> very<00:01:41.520> much<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:42.060> then<00:01:42.479> we<00:01:42.570> just

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
not adding very much and then we just

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:43.880 
not adding very much and then we just
firm<00:01:43.049> that<00:01:43.259> down<00:01:43.500> a<00:01:43.530> bit

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
firm that down a bit

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.780 
firm that down a bit
and<00:01:44.729> she's<00:01:44.970> done<00:01:45.320> we<00:01:46.320> put<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.649> on<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.979> seat<00:01:47.549> map

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
and she's done we put it on the seat map

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.030 
and she's done we put it on the seat map
to<00:01:48.060> keep<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.420> warm<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.930> a<00:01:49.079> way<00:01:49.380> it'll<00:01:49.619> go<00:01:49.860> it'll

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
to keep it warm and a way it'll go it'll

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.100 
to keep it warm and a way it'll go it'll
germinate<00:01:50.670> depending<00:01:51.360> on<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.600> seed<00:01:51.840> within

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
germinate depending on the seed within
