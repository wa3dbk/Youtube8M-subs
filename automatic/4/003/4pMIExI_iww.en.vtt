 ultimate team will be called everything by 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.039
 ronaldinho has to explain a little 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:32.009
 marshall because yes because the series 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.130

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.410
 will consist of trade to the single trade to the 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.500
 play any game until you reach 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.840
 ronaldinho compose it roller and efe the 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.020
 black is that this week is going to 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.149

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.470
 we will do among all the subscribers like this 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.660
 if you want the child 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.820
 tell your friends that they 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:58.300
 subscribe to two or three friends either 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:01.060
 it costs a lot and with plots you are more 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.860
 chances of getting it if you already 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.870
 possibly my luck showed how many 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.330
 more players if you like this series with 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.460
 ronaldinho when you finish you can ask 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.200
 Exhausts another player we like not to say 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.840
 mexico for it like being putting ourselves 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.130
 working but good with other games 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.740
 It could also be good as you see 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.900
 the team is more smh trading of these and 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:24.550
 a little bit of that bet and we started a 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:27.330
 little with the previous 00 coins 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:30.030
 we do the typical thing of 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.490
 perhaps at the beginning that is for everyone 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.850
 Bronze players to be sold for 150 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.610
 200 there are very good and buy about this from 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.520
 400 bronze which I recommend 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.950
 enough to start is also a 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.660
 the series we will give trading tips and 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.450
 Right now the councils have been 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.040
 that for example players with the short 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.010
 it's just with the way it sells for 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.560
 150 the bronze shape of a single 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:57.690
 player can get you 250 minimum if you 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.550
 2 touch and usually tends to happen 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.830
 you have everything about amortized because they are 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.350
 500 and here we see the first the 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.020
 first sales or if not being able to 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.360
 all sales trading forms 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.819
 go taking advice what we are 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.950
 saying this 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.870
 of the bronze envelopes and the whole roll 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.760
 that we teach all the bronze that 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.959
 we have in the deck to change and 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.340
 we understand that they are selling here 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.139
 we have the first three signings that 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.030
 we do not have a pretty player 

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:27.150
 good to work since you can 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:30.359
 catch for 150 200 350 with a lot and 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.879
 sell it for 800 domains and get it married 

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:35.099
 I'm going to take it for 300 and long and well 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:38.010
 of the 500 also those players who 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:39.989
 they do not get too much profit friends 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.749
 but you do not have to buy for me the 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:45.060
 large by 4000 but good for 

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:47.579
 start at the beginning we will make two 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.769
 bronze and silver blocks since our 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:52.560
 money at the moment is not very 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:55.319
 big and here we see ronaldinho player 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.889
 that we will raffle for 84 cabales goes about 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:00.750
 over 80,000 coins and with super 90 

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:02.699
 of irrigators when little bit of rhythm but 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.829
 that's okay, because ronaldinho 

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:07.049
 this is our tribute up to 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:09.019
 this great player and good little by little 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:11.790
 we hope to improve to get it 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:14.340
 we keep in the 90 dribble rhythm 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.930

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.590
