00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
to twist it the ends and push it up for

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:45.350 
to twist it the ends and push it up for
a<00:04:37.750> volume

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.980 

so<00:04:46.360> I<00:04:46.390> just<00:04:46.600> twisted<00:04:47.080> this<00:04:47.260> pushed<00:04:47.770> it<00:04:47.950> up<00:04:48.990> and

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:06.820 
texture so I don't want to pin them

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.140 
texture so I don't want to pin them
completely<00:05:07.300> have<00:05:07.690> a<00:05:07.720> little<00:05:08.020> bit<00:05:08.110> of<00:05:09.150> just
