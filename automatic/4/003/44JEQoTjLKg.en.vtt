00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.480
 charlie challenge took over 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.699
 from Internet 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.680
 many people still crossing pencil or 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.080
 pen on sheets of paper and 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.140
 asking if he delayed Mexican charlie 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.200
 this gift is very simple for you 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.790
 to play you have to get a 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.620
 paper and writing 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:46.879
 yes no just below do not you have to 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.879
 cross two pencils 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.489
 So you speak the question, Charlie. 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:57.059
 Charlie the river and his lips 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:00.030
 generated to the side yes means that 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.469
 charlie is here 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.840
 videos are not very few 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.030
 apparently the demon manifests the 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.040
 people run screaming 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.560
 but the specialist warned that this 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.790
 is not the correct way to end 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.799
 communication with the web 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.049
 we can find rules for 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.180
 talk to this spirit 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.960
 one of them is that not always you 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.520
 find a spirit did oblige yes 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.020
 demons also rondon this semblance of 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.170
 taboos the day 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.159
 some may even seem friendly but 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.159
 has sinister plans 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:40.009
 here comes the first big warning if you 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:41.119
 interrupt communication without saying 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.920
 goodbye 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:46.789
 likely to experience situations 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.810
 for normal as voices see things move 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:51.950
 alone 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:54.590
 we are mysterious laughter ominous to not 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.259
 tells you to ask you are allowing the 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.450
 demon enters your home in your life 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:02.349
 to close the contact with this 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:06.849
 charlie need to say charlie charlie 

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:10.519
 canon stop meaning charlie charlie 

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:12.590
 we can stop 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:13.459
 it is not known if such a devil understands 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.650
 Portuguese 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:18.620
 so the way is to take the conversation in 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.690
 That's right, Charlie. 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.569
 stop good 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.459
 just make some prayers and pray for 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:28.340
 that the spirit is gone 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:31.700
 When you finish prayers do not forget to 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:34.549
 say goodbye do not go running 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.299
 someone who never turns his back on 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:40.489
 the demon demons are entities 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:45.540
 extremely powerful and deserves 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:48.060
 respect even if this is the mouse 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.019
 have the courage to make charlie charlie 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.019
