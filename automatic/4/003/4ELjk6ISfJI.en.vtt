this<00:00:00.960> is<00:00:01.079> my<00:00:01.230> micro<00:00:01.650> so<00:00:02.490> box<00:00:02.760> tricopter<00:00:03.389> that

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
this is my micro so box tricopter that

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.079 
this is my micro so box tricopter that
built<00:00:03.870> last<00:00:04.020> night<00:00:04.400> I've<00:00:05.400> used<00:00:05.670> these<00:00:05.850> so

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
built last night I've used these so

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.570 
built last night I've used these so
boxes<00:00:06.569> on<00:00:06.810> my<00:00:06.930> last<00:00:07.140> tricopter<00:00:07.649> with<00:00:08.130> success

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
boxes on my last tricopter with success

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.570 
boxes on my last tricopter with success
so<00:00:08.820> I<00:00:09.320> was<00:00:10.320> coming<00:00:10.800> up<00:00:10.950> with<00:00:11.040> a<00:00:11.130> design<00:00:11.250> for

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
so I was coming up with a design for

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.039 
so I was coming up with a design for
this<00:00:11.639> tricopter<00:00:12.120> and<00:00:12.420> I<00:00:12.480> figured<00:00:12.809> it<00:00:12.929> would

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
this tricopter and I figured it would

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.310 
this tricopter and I figured it would
work<00:00:13.170> good<00:00:13.469> enough<00:00:13.710> for<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:13.920> frame<00:00:15.260> so<00:00:16.260> I

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
work good enough for the frame so I

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.050 
work good enough for the frame so I
built<00:00:16.560> this<00:00:16.680> tricopter<00:00:17.130> for<00:00:17.520> practicing<00:00:17.970> my

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
built this tricopter for practicing my

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.900 
built this tricopter for practicing my
line<00:00:18.210> of<00:00:18.240> sight<00:00:18.529> because<00:00:19.670> practicing<00:00:20.670> my<00:00:20.760> line

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
line of sight because practicing my line

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.960 
line of sight because practicing my line
of<00:00:20.939> sight<00:00:21.119> flight<00:00:21.570> with<00:00:21.750> my<00:00:21.990> big<00:00:22.260> tricopter

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:22.970 
of sight flight with my big tricopter

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.099 
of sight flight with my big tricopter
doesn't<00:00:23.970> go<00:00:24.060> over<00:00:24.240> too<00:00:24.390> good<00:00:24.600> because<00:00:24.779> it's

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
doesn't go over too good because it's

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.740 
doesn't go over too good because it's
got<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.640> fpv<00:00:26.640> equipment<00:00:27.119> and<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.300> GoPro<00:00:27.630> on

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
got the fpv equipment and the GoPro on

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.169 
got the fpv equipment and the GoPro on
it<00:00:27.990> so<00:00:28.140> if<00:00:28.230> you<00:00:28.320> crash<00:00:28.699> messing<00:00:29.699> around<00:00:29.789> it

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
it so if you crash messing around it

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.799 
it so if you crash messing around it
pretty<00:00:31.050> much<00:00:31.140> explodes<00:00:31.650> so<00:00:32.160> I<00:00:32.660> bought<00:00:33.660> this

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
pretty much explodes so I bought this

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.170 
pretty much explodes so I bought this
little<00:00:33.989> thing<00:00:34.350> for<00:00:34.760> getting<00:00:35.760> my<00:00:35.940> line<00:00:36.149> of

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
little thing for getting my line of

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.750 
little thing for getting my line of
sight<00:00:36.329> skills<00:00:37.050> up<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.410> par<00:00:38.510> so<00:00:39.510> I<00:00:39.540> got<00:00:40.520> the<00:00:41.520> soap

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
sight skills up to par so I got the soap

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.319 
sight skills up to par so I got the soap
dish<00:00:41.940> is<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.239> frame<00:00:43.040> and<00:00:44.040> I<00:00:44.100> got<00:00:44.250> some<00:00:44.550> 1/2

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
dish is the frame and I got some 1/2

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.959 
dish is the frame and I got some 1/2

settings and it's fine pretty good it's
a<00:02:11.610> little<00:02:11.790> bit<00:02:11.879> more<00:02:12.030> squirrely<00:02:12.690> than<00:02:12.840> I

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
a little bit more squirrely than I

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.070 
a little bit more squirrely than I
big<00:02:13.770> tricopter<00:02:14.489> but<00:02:15.390> I<00:02:15.420> guess<00:02:15.720> that's<00:02:15.900> nice

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
big tricopter but I guess that's nice

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.690 
big tricopter but I guess that's nice
because<00:02:16.260> you<00:02:16.379> can<00:02:16.410> do<00:02:16.739> come<00:02:16.980> some<00:02:17.310> more<00:02:17.459> crazy

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
because you can do come some more crazy
