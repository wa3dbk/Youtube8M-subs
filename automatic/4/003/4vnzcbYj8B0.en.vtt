for more details so this unboxing should

for more details so this unboxing should
be<00:00:12.599> pretty<00:00:12.780> straightforward<00:00:12.960> right<00:00:13.799> here

we've<00:00:14.190> got<00:00:14.219> ourselves<00:00:14.580> some<00:00:15.150> phobia<00:00:16.139> cable

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
we've got ourselves some phobia cable

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.890 
we've got ourselves some phobia cable
adapters<00:00:17.430> and<00:00:17.760> whatnots<00:00:18.359> and<00:00:18.690> what<00:00:18.810> I'm

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
adapters and whatnots and what I'm

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.029 
adapters and whatnots and what I'm
actually<00:00:19.050> going<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:19.380> do<00:00:19.590> is<00:00:19.740> I'm<00:00:19.859> just<00:00:19.949> going

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
actually going to do is I'm just going

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.130 
actually going to do is I'm just going
to<00:00:20.189> show<00:00:20.250> you<00:00:20.520> what<00:00:21.210> they<00:00:21.359> look<00:00:21.390> like<00:00:21.600> in<00:00:21.930> the

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
to show you what they look like in the

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.109 
to show you what they look like in the
packaging<00:00:22.650> because<00:00:22.800> it's<00:00:23.220> really<00:00:23.820> not<00:00:24.060> that

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
packaging because it's really not that

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.630 
packaging because it's really not that
interesting<00:00:24.869> or<00:00:25.019> exceptional<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:25.769> then<00:00:26.430> what

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
interesting or exceptional and then what

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.700 
interesting or exceptional and then what
I'll<00:00:26.730> be<00:00:26.760> doing<00:00:26.910> after<00:00:27.420> that<00:00:27.449> is<00:00:27.900> i<00:00:27.930> will<00:00:28.410> be

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
I'll be doing after that is i will be

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.140 
I'll be doing after that is i will be
showing<00:00:29.279> you<00:00:29.519> what<00:00:29.670> they<00:00:29.820> all<00:00:29.939> look<00:00:30.119> like

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
showing you what they all look like

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.200 
showing you what they all look like
outside<00:00:30.779> so<00:00:31.140> i<00:00:31.349> have<00:00:31.740> some<00:00:32.040> special<00:00:32.219> sort<00:00:33.120> of

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
outside so i have some special sort of

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.630 
outside so i have some special sort of
situations<00:00:34.050> going<00:00:34.230> on<00:00:34.440> here<00:00:34.739> where<00:00:34.920> i<00:00:34.950> needed

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
situations going on here where i needed

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.060 
situations going on here where i needed
some<00:00:36.059> cables<00:00:36.480> that<00:00:36.989> were<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.290> little<00:00:37.500> bit<00:00:37.800> sort

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
some cables that were a little bit sort

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.150 
some cables that were a little bit sort
of<00:00:38.129> custom-made<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:39.260> i<00:00:40.260> needed<00:00:40.920> them<00:00:41.129> for

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
of custom-made and i needed them for

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.459 
of custom-made and i needed them for
very<00:00:41.550> specific<00:00:41.879> purposes<00:00:42.690> here<00:00:42.960> like<00:00:43.170> I've

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
very specific purposes here like I've

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.799 
very specific purposes here like I've
got<00:00:43.680> eight<00:00:43.890> SSDs<00:00:44.670> they're<00:00:45.000> in<00:00:45.270> very<00:00:45.450> very

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
got eight SSDs they're in very very

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.660 
got eight SSDs they're in very very
close<00:00:46.289> quarters<00:00:46.710> here<00:00:46.890> so<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:47.129> needed<00:00:47.430> some

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
close quarters here so I needed some

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:48.979 
close quarters here so I needed some
cables<00:00:48.090> that<00:00:48.270> would<00:00:48.420> work<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.719> little<00:00:48.840> bit

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
cables that would work a little bit

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.590 
cables that would work a little bit
better<00:00:49.200> than<00:00:49.730> the<00:00:50.730> ones<00:00:50.910> that<00:00:51.149> come<00:00:51.360> with<00:00:51.510> the

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
better than the ones that come with the

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.450 
better than the ones that come with the
power<00:00:51.780> supply<00:00:52.050> which<00:00:52.770> typically<00:00:53.129> look<00:00:53.370> a

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
power supply which typically look a

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.010 
power supply which typically look a
little<00:00:53.579> something<00:00:53.910> like<00:00:54.000> this<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.570> are

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
little something like this and are

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.470 
little something like this and are
designed<00:00:55.410> for<00:00:55.559> longer<00:00:56.309> runs<00:00:56.610> in<00:00:56.969> between

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
designed for longer runs in between

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.510 
designed for longer runs in between
individual<00:00:58.140> drives<00:00:58.469> where<00:00:58.770> I<00:00:58.980> don't<00:00:59.309> have<00:00:59.489> a

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
individual drives where I don't have a

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.670 
individual drives where I don't have a
lot<00:00:59.789> of<00:00:59.820> extra<00:01:00.270> space<00:01:00.420> back<00:01:00.840> here<00:01:00.870> for<00:01:01.320> random

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
lot of extra space back here for random

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.889 
lot of extra space back here for random
cables<00:01:02.039> so<00:01:02.280> I've<00:01:02.789> got<00:01:03.030> those<00:01:03.239> then<00:01:03.600> I've<00:01:03.780> also

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
cables so I've got those then I've also

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.230 
cables so I've got those then I've also
got<00:01:04.350> some<00:01:04.680> 3-pin<00:01:05.070> splitters<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.729> extenders

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
got some 3-pin splitters and extenders

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.600 
got some 3-pin splitters and extenders
that<00:01:06.750> I'm<00:01:06.960> going<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.229> be<00:01:07.320> using<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.950> plug<00:01:08.189> fans

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
that I'm going to be using to plug fans

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.500 
that I'm going to be using to plug fans
and<00:01:08.939> LED<00:01:09.689> strips<00:01:10.049> into<00:01:10.670> mighty<00:01:11.670> balancer<00:01:12.330> here

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
and LED strips into mighty balancer here

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.060 
and LED strips into mighty balancer here
so<00:01:12.630> let's<00:01:12.810> get<00:01:12.930> those<00:01:13.080> packages<00:01:13.439> open<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:13.920> move

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
so let's get those packages open to move

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.130 
so let's get those packages open to move
be<00:01:14.130> back<00:01:14.280> in<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:14.490> moment<00:01:14.689> so<00:01:15.689> rather<00:01:15.869> than

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
be back in a moment so rather than

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.760 
be back in a moment so rather than
emphasize<00:01:17.180> the<00:01:18.180> unboxing<00:01:18.840> portion<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:19.380> this<00:01:19.530> I

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
emphasize the unboxing portion of this I

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:20.960 
emphasize the unboxing portion of this I
just<00:01:19.950> want<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.189> show<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:20.369> guys<00:01:20.549> pretty<00:01:20.880> much

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
just want to show you guys pretty much

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.520 
just want to show you guys pretty much
what<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.299> finished<00:01:21.450> product<00:01:21.900> looks<00:01:21.960> like<00:01:22.259> so

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
what the finished product looks like so

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.070 
what the finished product looks like so
these<00:01:23.100> are<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.369> SATA<00:01:23.729> ones<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.390> overall<00:01:24.990> they

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
these are the SATA ones and overall they

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.210 
these are the SATA ones and overall they
look<00:01:25.229> pretty<00:01:25.380> good<00:01:25.530> I'd<00:01:25.799> say<00:01:25.830> there's<00:01:26.159> a

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
look pretty good I'd say there's a

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.609 
look pretty good I'd say there's a
little<00:01:26.340> bit<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:26.520> inconsistency<00:01:26.700> in<00:01:27.689> terms<00:01:28.409> of

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
little bit of inconsistency in terms of

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:29.660 
little bit of inconsistency in terms of
hopefully<00:01:28.979> this<00:01:29.100> is<00:01:29.189> even<00:01:29.400> going<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.549> be<00:01:29.640> able

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
hopefully this is even going to be able

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.870 
hopefully this is even going to be able
to<00:01:29.850> focus<00:01:30.000> but<00:01:30.390> in<00:01:30.540> terms<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:31.020> where<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.189> see

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
to focus but in terms of where the see

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.640 
to focus but in terms of where the see
where<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.270> sleeving<00:01:33.540> actually<00:01:34.049> goes<00:01:34.259> up<00:01:34.470> to

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
where the sleeving actually goes up to

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.310 
where the sleeving actually goes up to
in<00:01:34.770> relation<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.640> wire<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:36.180> one<00:01:37.079> of<00:01:37.200> them

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
in relation to the wire and one of them

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.719 
in relation to the wire and one of them
actually<00:01:37.470> came<00:01:37.829> without<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.280> heat<00:01:38.430> shrink

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
actually came without the heat shrink

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.870 
actually came without the heat shrink
shrunk<00:01:39.479> so<00:01:40.350> those<00:01:40.560> are<00:01:40.740> still<00:01:41.130> move<00:01:41.759> around

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
shrunk so those are still move around

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.230 
shrunk so those are still move around

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.350 
to drive and then out to a molex
connector<00:02:23.400> so<00:02:23.580> that's<00:02:23.760> how<00:02:23.910> I'm<00:02:24.060> able<00:02:24.180> to

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.350 
connector so that's how I'm able to
power<00:02:24.660> all<00:02:25.140> those<00:02:25.590> drives<00:02:25.950> there<00:02:26.400> without

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
power all those drives there without

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.910 
power all those drives there without
well<00:02:30.360> without<00:02:30.840> running<00:02:31.200> a<00:02:31.380> whole<00:02:31.590> bunch<00:02:31.770> of

well without running a whole bunch of
separate<00:02:32.460> SATA<00:02:32.760> cable<00:02:33.120> so<00:02:33.300> there<00:02:33.540> you<00:02:33.630> go

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
separate SATA cable so there you go
