00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
misunderstood before I also like the low

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.010

maintenance<00:01:27.750> aspect<00:01:28.439> of<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:28.770> I<00:01:28.979> just<00:01:30.020> leave

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
maintenance aspect of it I just leave

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.520 
maintenance aspect of it I just leave
them<00:01:31.110> alone

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
them alone

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.319 
them alone
basically<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:32.220> separate<00:01:32.759> them<00:01:32.909> once<00:01:33.119> in<00:01:33.240> a

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
basically I separate them once in a

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.469 
basically I separate them once in a
while<00:01:33.479> just<00:01:34.729> making<00:01:35.729> sure<00:01:35.939> you<00:01:36.150> know<00:01:36.240> that

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
while just making sure you know that

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.649 
while just making sure you know that
they're<00:01:36.659> not<00:01:36.689> growing<00:01:37.320> together<00:01:37.710> so<00:01:38.250> I<00:01:39.240> go

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
they're not growing together so I go

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.590 
they're not growing together so I go
through<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.229> do<00:01:40.409> that<00:01:40.820> maybe<00:01:41.820> every<00:01:42.240> couple

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
through and do that maybe every couple

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.660 
through and do that maybe every couple
days<00:01:42.899> or<00:01:43.110> so<00:01:43.259> my<00:01:43.530> hair<00:01:43.680> doesn't<00:01:43.860> not<00:01:44.100> super

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
days or so my hair doesn't not super

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.530 
days or so my hair doesn't not super
fast<00:01:44.850> so<00:01:45.180> I<00:01:45.420> don't<00:01:45.750> have<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.960> do<00:01:46.079> it<00:01:46.170> every<00:01:46.350> day

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
fast so I don't have to do it every day

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.920 
fast so I don't have to do it every day
what<00:01:48.540> else<00:01:48.720> I<00:01:49.020> did<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.409> twist<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:49.860> rip<00:01:50.070> method

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:50.930 
what else I did the twist and rip method

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.469 
what else I did the twist and rip method
which<00:01:51.930> is<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.110> least<00:01:52.490> damaging<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:54.090> your<00:01:54.210> hair

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
which is the least damaging to your hair

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.050 
which is the least damaging to your hair
back<00:01:54.810> combing<00:01:55.140> would<00:01:56.100> be<00:01:56.219> like<00:01:56.460> next<00:01:56.729> up

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
back combing would be like next up

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.010 
back combing would be like next up
damage-wise

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
damage-wise

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.280 
damage-wise
I<00:01:58.469> just<00:01:59.009> decided<00:01:59.520> I<00:01:59.610> wanted<00:01:59.820> to<00:01:59.939> do<00:02:00.110> the<00:02:01.110> least

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290

and over again in different spots and it
starts<00:02:32.730> to<00:02:32.910> make<00:02:33.090> like<00:02:33.360> it's<00:02:33.780> hard<00:02:33.990> to<00:02:34.020> do<00:02:34.170> this

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
starts to make like it's hard to do this

with<00:02:34.530> iMovie<00:02:35.130> it<00:02:35.970> starts<00:02:36.330> to<00:02:36.540> make<00:02:36.720> a<00:02:36.990> little

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
knot and it's really just a blueprint

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.000 
knot and it's really just a blueprint
for<00:02:40.350> where<00:02:40.680> you<00:02:40.860> want<00:02:41.010> your<00:02:41.100> dreads<00:02:41.370> to<00:02:41.490> be

originally<00:03:28.019> was<00:03:28.650> one<00:03:28.920> huge<00:03:29.459> dread<00:03:29.790> and<00:03:30.500> then<00:03:31.500> I

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
originally was one huge dread and then I

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.740 
originally was one huge dread and then I
about<00:03:32.040> a<00:03:32.100> month<00:03:32.400> and<00:03:32.640> I<00:03:32.790> decided<00:03:33.150> to<00:03:33.269> separate

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
about a month and I decided to separate

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.520 
about a month and I decided to separate
them<00:03:33.959> because<00:03:34.560> your<00:03:35.070> dreads<00:03:35.400> will<00:03:36.390> be<00:03:36.570> as<00:03:36.930> big

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
them because your dreads will be as big

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.940 
them because your dreads will be as big
as<00:03:37.709> like<00:03:38.750> they'll<00:03:39.750> be<00:03:39.780> as<00:03:40.080> big<00:03:40.320> as<00:03:40.470> how<00:03:40.769> they

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
as like they'll be as big as how they

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.440 
as like they'll be as big as how they
are<00:03:40.980> up<00:03:41.280> here<00:03:41.580> at<00:03:41.880> the<00:03:42.120> root<00:03:43.100> so<00:03:44.180> it<00:03:45.180> was<00:03:45.299> just

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
here seems like the ones that I put

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:17.360 
here seems like the ones that I put
beads<00:04:15.959> on<00:04:16.169> have<00:04:16.590> been<00:04:16.680> dreading<00:04:16.919> easier

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
beads on have been dreading easier

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.849 
beads on have been dreading easier
especially<00:04:17.970> metal<00:04:18.479> beads<00:04:18.690> so<00:04:19.560> it's<00:04:19.680> got<00:04:19.829> a

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
especially metal beads so it's got a

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:27.050 
especially metal beads so it's got a
good<00:04:20.040> loop<00:04:20.729> starting<00:04:21.239> there

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.929 

let's<00:04:28.060> see<00:04:29.370> see<00:04:30.370> how<00:04:30.580> those<00:04:30.909> sections<00:04:31.389> are

00:04:32.929 --> 00:04:32.939 
let's see see how those sections are

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:40.950 
let's see see how those sections are
this<00:04:33.939> one's<00:04:34.210> a<00:04:34.360> really<00:04:34.569> big<00:04:34.960> one<00:04:38.250> so<00:04:39.250> I<00:04:40.000> keep

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
this one's a really big one so I keep

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.209 
this one's a really big one so I keep
going<00:04:41.169> the<00:04:41.379> wrong<00:04:41.500> way<00:04:41.560> on<00:04:41.889> this

00:04:42.209 --> 00:04:42.219 
going the wrong way on this

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:47.490 
going the wrong way on this
that<00:04:43.120> one's<00:04:43.330> got<00:04:43.629> two<00:04:43.990> loops<00:04:45.000> and<00:04:46.000> it's<00:04:46.930> got<00:04:47.259> a

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
that one's got two loops and it's got a

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:54.209 
that one's got two loops and it's got a
really<00:04:47.740> good<00:04:48.099> texture<00:04:49.050> nodding<00:04:51.599> and<00:04:53.219> I'll

00:04:54.209 --> 00:04:54.219 
really good texture nodding and I'll

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:57.059 
really good texture nodding and I'll
show<00:04:54.430> you<00:04:54.520> the<00:04:54.909> back<00:04:55.060> in<00:04:55.509> just<00:04:55.750> a<00:04:55.840> second<00:04:56.259> hold

00:04:57.059 --> 00:04:57.069 
show you the back in just a second hold

00:04:57.069 --> 00:05:05.969 
show you the back in just a second hold
on<00:05:02.069> so<00:05:03.069> a<00:05:03.099> lot<00:05:03.310> of<00:05:03.340> waves<00:05:03.610> a<00:05:04.180> lot<00:05:04.449> of<00:05:04.889> there's<00:05:05.889> a

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:05.979 
on so a lot of waves a lot of there's a

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:15.800 
on so a lot of waves a lot of there's a
good<00:05:06.219> one<00:05:06.400> starting<00:05:08.190> so<00:05:09.190> I<00:05:09.550> don't<00:05:10.300> know
