00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:40.510
 speck a slice of cooked ham a 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:43.660
 a little bit of mayonnaise making an asparagus is 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:46.659
 a solution of water and vinegar eight 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.820
 parts of water and part of vinegar 

00:00:46.659 --> 00:01:03.070
 now let's boil to cook the 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:01:07.019
 laughed along with the shooting and 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.019
 a plentiful pinch of salt 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.130
 well now that the cooking water is there 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:15.940
 dried up the sticky rice 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.770
 we can turn it off and let it rest 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.899
 for about twenty minutes so that you 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.570

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.600
 in the solution of water and vinegar 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.079
 this serves to make sure that the 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:38.740
 rice does not stick to the hands 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:42.240

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.240
 we remove the flai in the toilet 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.490
 we cut it and create it 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.400
 a small square of laughter 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.009
