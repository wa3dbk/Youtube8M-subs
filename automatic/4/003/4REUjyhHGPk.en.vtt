yeah hello Simon we are here to acma the
Milano<00:00:06.950> motorcycle<00:00:07.950> exhibition<00:00:08.160> and<00:00:08.849> I<00:00:09.420> to

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
Milano motorcycle exhibition and I to

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.259 
Milano motorcycle exhibition and I to
triumph<00:00:09.870> stand<00:00:10.170> I<00:00:10.410> was<00:00:10.590> impressed<00:00:10.980> I<00:00:11.730> see<00:00:12.240> a

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
triumph stand I was impressed I see a

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.049 
triumph stand I was impressed I see a
quite<00:00:12.990> new<00:00:13.170> Daytona<00:00:13.700> yesterday<00:00:14.700> I<00:00:14.730> got<00:00:14.940> to

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
quite new Daytona yesterday I got to

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.300 
quite new Daytona yesterday I got to
press<00:00:15.299> information<00:00:15.570> and<00:00:16.080> I<00:00:16.139> so<00:00:16.289> loud<00:00:16.500> it's<00:00:17.100> not

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
press information and I so loud it's not

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.680 
press information and I so loud it's not
so<00:00:17.460> interesting<00:00:17.910> because<00:00:17.940> supersport

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
so interesting because supersport

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.200 
so interesting because supersport
segment<00:00:19.140> at<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.560> moment<00:00:20.010> isn't<00:00:20.580> interesting

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
segment at the moment isn't interesting

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.240 
segment at the moment isn't interesting
for<00:00:21.359> other<00:00:21.449> manufacturers<00:00:22.140> maybe<00:00:22.980> it's<00:00:23.220> just

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
for other manufacturers maybe it's just

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.790 
for other manufacturers maybe it's just
some<00:00:23.670> small<00:00:23.850> minor<00:00:24.420> changes<00:00:24.930> but<00:00:25.140> it's<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.529> new

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
some small minor changes but it's a new

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.279 
some small minor changes but it's a new
back<00:00:26.039> in<00:00:26.220> factor<00:00:26.580> yeah<00:00:27.269> it's<00:00:27.539> an<00:00:27.750> all<00:00:27.869> new<00:00:28.050> bike

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
back in factor yeah it's an all new bike

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.580 
back in factor yeah it's an all new bike
there<00:00:28.980> are<00:00:29.420> maybe<00:00:30.420> a<00:00:30.539> handful<00:00:30.900> of<00:00:30.960> components

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
there are maybe a handful of components

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:32.720 
there are maybe a handful of components
that<00:00:31.710> are<00:00:31.769> the<00:00:31.890> same<00:00:32.040> as<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.340> last<00:00:32.460> year's

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
that are the same as the last year's

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.819 
that are the same as the last year's
bike<00:00:32.910> you<00:00:33.390> know<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.750> front<00:00:33.989> mudguard<00:00:34.170> the

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
bike you know the front mudguard the

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.280 
bike you know the front mudguard the
indicators<00:00:35.340> before<00:00:36.270> tres<00:00:36.450> truly<00:00:36.780> nothing<00:00:36.930> so

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
indicators before tres truly nothing so

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.940 
indicators before tres truly nothing so
yeah<00:00:37.440> all<00:00:37.649> new<00:00:37.920> engine<00:00:38.250> new<00:00:38.480> chassis<00:00:39.620> ok<00:00:40.620> let's

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
yeah all new engine new chassis ok let's

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.729 
yeah all new engine new chassis ok let's
go<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.489> engine<00:00:41.910> it's<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.930> 675<00:00:44.149> CCM<00:00:45.739> engine

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
go to the engine it's a 675 CCM engine

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.880 
go to the engine it's a 675 CCM engine
but<00:00:47.270> everything<00:00:48.270> out<00:00:48.390> of<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.960> main<00:00:49.230> technical

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
but everything out of the main technical

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.130 
but everything out of the main technical
parts<00:00:50.280> is<00:00:50.399> new<00:00:50.610> can<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:51.600> tell<00:00:51.750> us<00:00:51.780> something

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
parts is new can you tell us something

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.670 
parts is new can you tell us something
about<00:00:52.199> it<00:00:52.640> ok<00:00:53.640> fundamentally<00:00:54.510> we<00:00:54.690> came<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.590> the

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
about it ok fundamentally we came to the

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.200 
about it ok fundamentally we came to the
conclusion<00:00:55.710> that<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.610> increase<00:00:57.030> the

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
conclusion that to increase the

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.900 
conclusion that to increase the
performance<00:00:57.410> but<00:00:58.410> maintain<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.250> talk<00:00:59.640> and

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
performance but maintain the talk and

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.000 
performance but maintain the talk and
the<00:00:59.969> character<00:01:00.449> we<00:01:00.989> needed<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.350> new<00:01:01.500> engine<00:01:01.649> we

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
the character we needed a new engine we

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.149 
the character we needed a new engine we
had<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.280> change<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.699> bore<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.000> Stroke<00:01:04.159> made

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
had to change the bore and Stroke made

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.320 
had to change the bore and Stroke made
some<00:01:05.339> other<00:01:05.460> improvements<00:01:05.729> along<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.210> way

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
some other improvements along the way

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.300 
some other improvements along the way
but<00:01:07.229> fundamentally<00:01:07.830> we<00:01:07.920> needed<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.189> different

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
but fundamentally we needed a different

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.450 
but fundamentally we needed a different
construction<00:01:09.090> on<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.540> engine<00:01:09.810> so<00:01:09.990> if<00:01:10.140> our

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
construction on the engine so if our

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.340 
construction on the engine so if our
engine<00:01:11.460> so<00:01:11.670> far<00:01:11.880> I've<00:01:12.030> always<00:01:12.180> had<00:01:12.420> separate

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
engine so far I've always had separate

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.460 
engine so far I've always had separate
cylinder<00:01:14.040> liners<00:01:14.400> yeah<00:01:15.390> so<00:01:15.780> individual

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
cylinder liners yeah so individual

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.320 
cylinder liners yeah so individual
liners<00:01:16.860> are<00:01:16.979> dropping<00:01:17.159> the<00:01:17.369> engine<00:01:17.670> we<00:01:18.060> had<00:01:18.210> to

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
liners are dropping the engine we had to

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.960 
liners are dropping the engine we had to
move<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.689> solid<00:01:18.960> block<00:01:19.400> to<00:01:20.400> enable<00:01:20.820> us<00:01:20.939> to

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
move to a solid block to enable us to

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.300 
move to a solid block to enable us to
increase<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.720> bore<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.770> increase<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.189> damage

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
increase the bore to increase the damage

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.780 
increase the bore to increase the damage
of<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.700> piston<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.180> reduce<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.080> stroke<00:01:25.790> the

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
of the piston and reduce the stroke the

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.480 
of the piston and reduce the stroke the
solid<00:01:27.780> block<00:01:28.049> also<00:01:28.439> is<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.590> bit<00:01:28.799> stronger<00:01:29.130> than

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
solid block also is a bit stronger than

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.310 
solid block also is a bit stronger than
the<00:01:29.640> individual<00:01:30.030> liners<00:01:30.420> so<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:30.960> allowed<00:01:31.290> us

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
the individual liners so that allowed us

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.039 
the individual liners so that allowed us
to<00:01:31.530> generate<00:01:31.770> higher<00:01:32.280> pressures<00:01:32.909> inside<00:01:33.689> the

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
to generate higher pressures inside the

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.960 
to generate higher pressures inside the
combustion<00:01:34.380> chamber<00:01:34.530> which<00:01:35.310> instantly<00:01:35.729> gave

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
combustion chamber which instantly gave

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.080 
combustion chamber which instantly gave
us<00:01:36.150> more<00:01:36.420> talk<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.350> more<00:01:37.740> power<00:01:37.979> not<00:01:38.729> just<00:01:38.909> the

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
us more talk and more power not just the

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.819 
us more talk and more power not just the
top<00:01:39.270> end<00:01:39.420> but<00:01:39.600> everywhere<00:01:39.930> so<00:01:40.560> that's<00:01:40.710> what

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
top end but everywhere so that's what

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.170 
top end but everywhere so that's what
we're<00:01:40.950> looking<00:01:41.189> for

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
we're looking for

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.960 
we're looking for
other<00:01:42.870> improvements<00:01:43.410> we've<00:01:44.070> got<00:01:44.250> titanium

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
other improvements we've got titanium

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.480 
other improvements we've got titanium
valves<00:01:45.360> in<00:01:45.510> there<00:01:45.660> now<00:01:45.840> because<00:01:46.560> because<00:01:47.340> the

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
valves in there now because because the

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.070 
valves in there now because because the
stroke<00:01:47.760> is<00:01:47.940> shorter<00:01:48.390> we've<00:01:48.600> been<00:01:48.750> able<00:01:48.870> to

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
stroke is shorter we've been able to

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.550 
stroke is shorter we've been able to
turn<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.250> engine<00:01:50.340> faster<00:01:50.730> another<00:01:51.630> 500<00:01:52.200> rpm

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
turn the engine faster another 500 rpm

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.890 
turn the engine faster another 500 rpm
to<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.800> peak<00:01:52.980> speed<00:01:53.280> four<00:01:54.060> thousand<00:01:54.480> fourteen

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 
to the peak speed four thousand fourteen

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.200 
to the peak speed four thousand fourteen
thousand<00:01:55.290> four<00:01:55.440> hundred<00:01:55.880> so<00:01:56.880> we've<00:01:56.970> had<00:01:57.090> to

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
thousand four hundred so we've had to

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.870 
thousand four hundred so we've had to
put<00:01:57.360> in<00:01:57.479> titanium<00:01:57.780> valves<00:01:58.430> we've<00:01:59.430> also<00:01:59.610> taken

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
put in titanium valves we've also taken

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.969 
put in titanium valves we've also taken
the<00:02:00.090> opportunity<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.660> reshape<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.380> valves<00:02:01.770> or

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
the opportunity to reshape the valves or

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.010 
the opportunity to reshape the valves or
better<00:02:02.250> flow<00:02:02.580> so<00:02:03.000> getting<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.600> gases<00:02:03.900> into

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
better flow so getting the gases into

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.560 
better flow so getting the gases into
the<00:02:04.140> engine<00:02:04.380> better<00:02:04.820> we've<00:02:05.820> got<00:02:06.060> twin

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
the engine better we've got twin

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.870 
the engine better we've got twin
injectors<00:02:07.080> on<00:02:07.200> each<00:02:07.320> cylinder<00:02:07.650> so<00:02:08.490> that<00:02:08.670> gives

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
injectors on each cylinder so that gives

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.699 
injectors on each cylinder so that gives
you<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.270> best<00:02:09.420> chance<00:02:09.600> to<00:02:09.959> optimize<00:02:10.470> the

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
you the best chance to optimize the

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.740 
you the best chance to optimize the
fueling<00:02:11.070> again<00:02:11.610> not<00:02:12.000> just<00:02:12.209> at<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.390> top<00:02:12.570> end

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
fueling again not just at the top end

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.690 
fueling again not just at the top end
but<00:02:13.500> down<00:02:13.680> at<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:13.890> bottom<00:02:14.040> end<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.400> mid-range

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
but down at the bottom end the mid-range

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.100 
but down at the bottom end the mid-range
so<00:02:14.940> you<00:02:15.030> get<00:02:15.150> better<00:02:15.330> talking<00:02:15.720> power

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
so you get better talking power

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.949 
so you get better talking power
everywhere<00:02:17.300> on<00:02:18.300> the<00:02:18.420> bottom<00:02:18.690> end<00:02:18.810> of<00:02:18.900> the

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
everywhere on the bottom end of the

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:20.210 
everywhere on the bottom end of the
engine<00:02:19.200> we<00:02:19.260> made<00:02:19.410> a<00:02:19.440> lot<00:02:19.590> of<00:02:19.620> changes<00:02:20.040> to<00:02:20.070> the

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
engine we made a lot of changes to the

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.890 
engine we made a lot of changes to the
clutching<00:02:20.610> gearbox<00:02:21.030> it's<00:02:21.239> now<00:02:21.420> a<00:02:21.450> slipper

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
clutching gearbox it's now a slipper

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.110 
clutching gearbox it's now a slipper
clutch<00:02:22.110> which<00:02:22.830> gives<00:02:23.040> you<00:02:23.130> better<00:02:23.310> rear<00:02:23.910> wheel

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
clutch which gives you better rear wheel

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.030 
clutch which gives you better rear wheel
control<00:02:24.540> under<00:02:24.810> aggressive<00:02:25.230> breaking<00:02:25.620> into

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
control under aggressive breaking into

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.640 
control under aggressive breaking into
corners<00:02:26.370> we've<00:02:27.330> made<00:02:27.660> lots<00:02:27.840> of<00:02:28.020> changed<00:02:28.290> to

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
corners we've made lots of changed to

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.500 
corners we've made lots of changed to
the<00:02:28.739> gearbox<00:02:29.160> itself<00:02:29.340> and<00:02:29.730> to<00:02:30.209> the<00:02:30.330> gear

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
the gearbox itself and to the gear

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.080 
the gearbox itself and to the gear
selection<00:02:30.810> mechanism<00:02:31.080> to<00:02:31.590> make<00:02:32.220> it<00:02:32.430> lighter

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
selection mechanism to make it lighter

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.199 
selection mechanism to make it lighter
and<00:02:33.390> more<00:02:33.810> precise<00:02:34.200> so<00:02:35.040> at<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:35.820> end<00:02:35.880> of<00:02:36.060> that

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
and more precise so at the end of that

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.630 
and more precise so at the end of that
again<00:02:36.810> there<00:02:36.959> are<00:02:37.110> some<00:02:38.010> parts<00:02:38.370> that<00:02:38.400> are<00:02:38.580> the

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
again there are some parts that are the

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.330 
again there are some parts that are the
same<00:02:38.820> basically<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.690> clutch<00:02:40.560> cover<00:02:40.800> you<00:02:41.280> know

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
same basically the clutch cover you know

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.280 
same basically the clutch cover you know
so<00:02:41.520> that<00:02:41.550> looks<00:02:41.820> the<00:02:41.940> same<00:02:42.120> so<00:02:42.180> a<00:02:42.630> lot<00:02:43.260> of

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
so that looks the same so a lot of

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.510 
so that looks the same so a lot of
people<00:02:43.590> thought<00:02:43.709> it<00:02:43.770> was<00:02:43.920> the<00:02:44.040> same<00:02:44.190> engine

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
people thought it was the same engine

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.699 
people thought it was the same engine
yeah<00:02:45.270> when<00:02:45.480> they<00:02:45.600> saw<00:02:45.780> the<00:02:45.810> first<00:02:46.140> spy<00:02:46.440> shots

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
yeah when they saw the first spy shots

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.500 
yeah when they saw the first spy shots
in<00:02:46.830> the<00:02:46.890> press<00:02:47.100> so<00:02:47.670> it's<00:02:47.790> been<00:02:47.910> nice<00:02:48.090> for<00:02:48.120> us<00:02:48.360> to

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
in the press so it's been nice for us to

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.390 
in the press so it's been nice for us to
at<00:02:48.600> least<00:02:48.660> have<00:02:48.840> one<00:02:49.049> surprise<00:02:49.290> to<00:02:49.980> get<00:02:50.070> people

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
at least have one surprise to get people

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.090 
at least have one surprise to get people
that<00:02:50.459> it's<00:02:50.610> a<00:02:50.700> new<00:02:50.910> engine<00:02:51.090> as<00:02:51.299> well<00:02:51.450> ok<00:02:52.440> and

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
that it's a new engine as well ok and

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.520 
that it's a new engine as well ok and
let's<00:02:53.430> go<00:02:53.820> to<00:02:53.880> the<00:02:54.030> things<00:02:54.269> that<00:02:54.510> are<00:02:54.900> not<00:02:55.290> so

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
let's go to the things that are not so

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.630 
let's go to the things that are not so
wizard<00:02:55.739> with<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:56.489> first<00:02:57.470> touch<00:02:58.470> so<00:02:58.950> what

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
wizard with the first touch so what

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.880 
wizard with the first touch so what
about<00:02:59.760> electronic<00:03:00.570> stuff<00:03:00.840> on<00:03:01.110> his<00:03:01.230> bike<00:03:01.470> well

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
about electronic stuff on his bike well

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.009 
about electronic stuff on his bike well
what<00:03:02.430> do<00:03:02.549> you<00:03:02.640> have<00:03:02.820> here<00:03:02.850> ok<00:03:03.750> there's<00:03:03.959> a

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
what do you have here ok there's a

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:05.360 
what do you have here ok there's a
couple<00:03:04.170> of<00:03:04.320> areas<00:03:04.470> we<00:03:04.620> were<00:03:04.709> brought<00:03:04.920> in<00:03:05.100> some

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
couple of areas we were brought in some

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.320 
couple of areas we were brought in some
more<00:03:05.640> electronic<00:03:06.540> control<00:03:06.930> rite<00:03:07.590> aid's<00:03:08.330> first

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
more electronic control rite aid's first

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.509 
more electronic control rite aid's first
of<00:03:09.450> all<00:03:09.510> is<00:03:09.690> the<00:03:09.780> ABS<00:03:10.140> now<00:03:10.860> we've<00:03:11.100> introduced

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
of all is the ABS now we've introduced

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.390 
of all is the ABS now we've introduced
ABS<00:03:11.880> on<00:03:12.030> the<00:03:12.090> day<00:03:12.209> turn<00:03:12.390> of<00:03:12.540> the<00:03:12.630> first<00:03:12.840> time

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
ABS on the day turn of the first time

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.009 
ABS on the day turn of the first time
for<00:03:14.400> some<00:03:14.580> guys<00:03:14.790> who<00:03:15.090> spend<00:03:15.360> a<00:03:15.450> lot<00:03:15.570> of<00:03:15.600> time<00:03:15.720> on

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
for some guys who spend a lot of time on

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:17.810 
for some guys who spend a lot of time on
the<00:03:16.080> track<00:03:16.290> or<00:03:16.350> running<00:03:16.860> really<00:03:17.010> hard<00:03:17.220> they

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
the track or running really hard they

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.789 
the track or running really hard they
say<00:03:17.970> are<00:03:18.000> we<00:03:18.150> not<00:03:18.570> interesting<00:03:18.989> ABS<00:03:19.320> just<00:03:19.620> gets

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
say are we not interesting ABS just gets

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.340 
say are we not interesting ABS just gets
in<00:03:19.920> the<00:03:19.950> way<00:03:20.040> so<00:03:20.790> we've<00:03:20.940> developed<00:03:21.209> a<00:03:21.540> circuit

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
in the way so we've developed a circuit

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.680 
in the way so we've developed a circuit
calibration<00:03:23.010> the<00:03:23.640> rider<00:03:23.940> can<00:03:24.150> select<00:03:24.510> it

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
calibration the rider can select it

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.289 
calibration the rider can select it
through<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.019> instruments<00:03:25.470> and<00:03:25.850> that<00:03:26.850> circuit

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
through the instruments and that circuit

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.720 
through the instruments and that circuit
calibration<00:03:27.959> basically<00:03:28.920> means<00:03:29.250> that<00:03:29.459> the

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
calibration basically means that the

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.210 
calibration basically means that the
rider<00:03:29.970> on<00:03:30.420> a<00:03:30.510> dry<00:03:30.900> track<00:03:31.230> can<00:03:31.620> ride<00:03:31.829> very

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
rider on a dry track can ride very

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.220 
rider on a dry track can ride very
aggressively<00:03:32.760> very<00:03:33.360> hard<00:03:33.630> and<00:03:33.840> will<00:03:34.019> not

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
aggressively very hard and will not

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.400 
aggressively very hard and will not
notice<00:03:34.650> the<00:03:35.010> ABS<00:03:35.340> it<00:03:35.579> will<00:03:35.700> not<00:03:35.850> intrude<00:03:36.410> if

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
notice the ABS it will not intrude if

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:38.960 
notice the ABS it will not intrude if
he's<00:03:37.620> good<00:03:37.950> enough<00:03:37.980> well<00:03:38.610> she's<00:03:38.790> good<00:03:38.940> enough

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
he's good enough well she's good enough

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.090 
he's good enough well she's good enough
they<00:03:39.570> can<00:03:39.600> even<00:03:39.840> slide<00:03:40.320> the<00:03:40.590> back<00:03:40.709> end<00:03:40.920> into

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
they can even slide the back end into

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.340 
they can even slide the back end into
the<00:03:41.250> corners<00:03:41.610> allow<00:03:42.090> is<00:03:42.269> much<00:03:42.510> more<00:03:42.720> slip<00:03:43.140> on

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
the corners allow is much more slip on

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
the corners allow is much more slip on
the<00:03:43.440> back<00:03:43.560> end

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
the back end

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.479 
the back end
but<00:03:45.060> then<00:03:45.239> if<00:03:45.540> the<00:03:45.750> rider<00:03:46.069> rides<00:03:47.069> on<00:03:47.250> to<00:03:47.370> our

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
but then if the rider rides on to our

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.430 
but then if the rider rides on to our
wet<00:03:47.700> track<00:03:48.030> for<00:03:48.420> example<00:03:48.750> then<00:03:48.870> the<00:03:48.959> ABS<00:03:49.260> will

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
wet track for example then the ABS will

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.009 
wet track for example then the ABS will
operate<00:03:49.739> normally<00:03:50.269> or<00:03:51.269> if<00:03:51.390> the<00:03:51.510> rider<00:03:51.690> you

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
operate normally or if the rider you

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:53.750 
operate normally or if the rider you
know<00:03:52.110> goes<00:03:52.620> off<00:03:52.830> the<00:03:52.980> circuit<00:03:53.190> onto<00:03:53.489> the<00:03:53.580> grass

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
know goes off the circuit onto the grass

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.250 
know goes off the circuit onto the grass
then<00:03:53.970> all<00:03:54.060> of<00:03:54.090> a<00:03:54.209> sudden<00:03:54.480> you've<00:03:54.599> got<00:03:54.629> abs<00:03:55.019> to

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
then all of a sudden you've got abs to

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.530 
then all of a sudden you've got abs to
help<00:03:55.409> you<00:03:55.530> stay<00:03:55.920> upright<00:03:56.040> so<00:03:56.879> we<00:03:57.030> see<00:03:57.239> it<00:03:57.299> as<00:03:57.420> an

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
help you stay upright so we see it as an

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.979 
help you stay upright so we see it as an
ABS<00:03:57.870> system<00:03:58.470> that<00:03:59.280> will<00:03:59.610> not<00:04:00.000> intrude<00:04:00.510> in

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
ABS system that will not intrude in

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.949 
ABS system that will not intrude in
sports<00:04:01.860> riding<00:04:02.280> so<00:04:02.909> there's<00:04:03.360> no<00:04:03.390> reason<00:04:03.720> for

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
sports riding so there's no reason for

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.020 
sports riding so there's no reason for
the<00:04:04.019> sports<00:04:04.230> right<00:04:04.470> Ryder<00:04:04.709> not<00:04:05.400> to<00:04:05.549> want<00:04:05.760> this

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
the sports right Ryder not to want this

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.360 
the sports right Ryder not to want this
ABS<00:04:06.360> system<00:04:06.540> it's<00:04:07.290> also<00:04:07.440> much<00:04:07.709> lighter<00:04:08.040> than

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
ABS system it's also much lighter than

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.069 
ABS system it's also much lighter than
previous<00:04:08.519> ABS<00:04:09.150> systems<00:04:09.450> it<00:04:09.540> only<00:04:09.690> adds<00:04:09.900> one

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:10.079 
previous ABS systems it only adds one

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:12.680 
previous ABS systems it only adds one
and<00:04:10.170> a<00:04:10.200> half<00:04:10.260> kilos<00:04:11.329> second<00:04:12.329> area<00:04:12.480> we've

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
and a half kilos second area we've

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.170 
and a half kilos second area we've
improved<00:04:13.560> the<00:04:13.799> electronic<00:04:14.280> rider<00:04:14.579> AIDS<00:04:14.879> is<00:04:15.060> on

improved the electronic rider AIDS is on

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.759 
improved the electronic rider AIDS is on
the<00:04:15.239> quick<00:04:15.420> shifter<00:04:15.780> which<00:04:16.199> is<00:04:16.350> standard<00:04:16.560> on

standard bike you just fit it an offer

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.270 
standard bike you just fit it an offer
goes<00:04:20.699> it<00:04:20.940> work<00:04:21.239> straightaway<00:04:21.830> the<00:04:22.830> software

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
goes it work straightaway the software

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.120 
goes it work straightaway the software
have<00:04:23.370> changed<00:04:23.729> significantly<00:04:23.880> and<00:04:24.600> now<00:04:25.350> the

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
have changed significantly and now the

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.189 
have changed significantly and now the
quick<00:04:26.340> the<00:04:26.520> quick<00:04:26.699> shifter<00:04:27.060> works<00:04:27.300> by

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:28.199 
quick the quick shifter works by

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:30.620 
quick the quick shifter works by
interrupting<00:04:28.770> the<00:04:29.190> ignition<00:04:29.580> on<00:04:29.699> the<00:04:29.910> engine

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
interrupting the ignition on the engine

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.629 
interrupting the ignition on the engine
when<00:04:30.840> you<00:04:30.960> push<00:04:31.590> on<00:04:31.740> the<00:04:31.860> lever<00:04:32.039> yeah<00:04:32.400> its

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:32.639 
when you push on the lever yeah its

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:34.490 
when you push on the lever yeah its
senses<00:04:33.030> pressure<00:04:33.300> and<00:04:33.630> stops<00:04:34.289> the<00:04:34.470> engine

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
senses pressure and stops the engine

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.370 
senses pressure and stops the engine
very<00:04:35.130> briefly<00:04:35.460> so<00:04:36.060> you<00:04:36.120> change<00:04:36.419> gear<00:04:36.690> so<00:04:37.320> it

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
very briefly so you change gear so it

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.830 
very briefly so you change gear so it
removes<00:04:37.620> the<00:04:37.860> load<00:04:38.039> on<00:04:38.250> the<00:04:38.280> engine<00:04:38.720> so<00:04:39.720> the

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
removes the load on the engine so the

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.900 
removes the load on the engine so the
system<00:04:40.229> has<00:04:40.380> now<00:04:40.530> changed<00:04:40.889> now<00:04:41.340> it<00:04:41.520> looks<00:04:41.699> at

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
system has now changed now it looks at

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:43.730 
system has now changed now it looks at
the<00:04:42.000> engine<00:04:42.330> speed<00:04:42.690> but<00:04:43.050> also<00:04:43.169> the<00:04:43.410> throttle

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
the engine speed but also the throttle

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.460 
the engine speed but also the throttle
position<00:04:44.130> and<00:04:44.310> works<00:04:45.150> out<00:04:45.389> exactly<00:04:45.840> how<00:04:46.139> long

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
position and works out exactly how long

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.279 
position and works out exactly how long
to<00:04:46.800> cut<00:04:47.039> the<00:04:47.220> ignition<00:04:47.580> and<00:04:47.699> fuel<00:04:47.789> for<00:04:48.330> ana

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:49.289 
to cut the ignition and fuel for ana

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:51.379 
to cut the ignition and fuel for ana
goes<00:04:49.590> between<00:04:49.830> about<00:04:50.220> 40<00:04:50.729> milliseconds<00:04:51.090> and

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:51.389 
goes between about 40 milliseconds and

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:53.930 
goes between about 40 milliseconds and
about<00:04:51.570> 120<00:04:52.050> milliseconds<00:04:52.470> so<00:04:53.039> short<00:04:53.789> length

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
about 120 milliseconds so short length

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.879 
about 120 milliseconds so short length
of<00:04:54.120> time<00:04:54.330> but<00:04:54.690> it<00:04:54.810> changes<00:04:55.289> depending<00:04:55.470> on

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:55.889 
of time but it changes depending on

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:59.379 
of time but it changes depending on
those<00:04:56.099> conditions<00:04:57.289> also<00:04:58.289> when<00:04:58.740> the<00:04:58.770> ignition

00:04:59.379 --> 00:04:59.389 
those conditions also when the ignition

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:01.879 
those conditions also when the ignition
reinstates<00:05:00.389> when<00:05:00.690> it<00:05:00.780> starts<00:05:01.110> again<00:05:01.260> after

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:01.889 
reinstates when it starts again after

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:05.210 
reinstates when it starts again after
this<00:05:01.979> 40<00:05:02.910> milliseconds<00:05:03.139> it<00:05:04.139> doesn't<00:05:04.500> go<00:05:04.650> all

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
this 40 milliseconds it doesn't go all

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.980 
this 40 milliseconds it doesn't go all
three<00:05:05.460> cylinders<00:05:05.849> at<00:05:05.940> once<00:05:06.150> it<00:05:06.510> goes<00:05:06.660> one

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:06.990 
three cylinders at once it goes one

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.020 
three cylinders at once it goes one
cylinder<00:05:07.289> then<00:05:07.770> the<00:05:07.889> second<00:05:08.250> then<00:05:08.669> the<00:05:08.820> third

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
cylinder then the second then the third

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.570 
cylinder then the second then the third
so<00:05:09.330> it's<00:05:09.360> a<00:05:09.510> progressive<00:05:10.280> reinstatement<00:05:11.280> and

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
so it's a progressive reinstatement and

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.150 
so it's a progressive reinstatement and
those<00:05:12.180> three<00:05:12.740> reinstatements<00:05:13.740> come<00:05:13.919> over

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
those three reinstatements come over

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.070 
those three reinstatements come over
maybe<00:05:14.460> 10<00:05:14.789> 15<00:05:14.940> milliseconds<00:05:15.389> a<00:05:15.690> very<00:05:15.870> short

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
maybe 10 15 milliseconds a very short

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.960 
maybe 10 15 milliseconds a very short
time<00:05:16.139> so<00:05:17.039> you<00:05:17.130> don't<00:05:17.310> feel<00:05:17.490> it<00:05:17.550> coming<00:05:17.910> in

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
time so you don't feel it coming in

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.089 
time so you don't feel it coming in
progressively<00:05:18.479> what<00:05:19.320> you<00:05:19.410> feel<00:05:19.620> as<00:05:19.770> a<00:05:19.800> rider

00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:20.099 
progressively what you feel as a rider

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:21.950 
progressively what you feel as a rider
is<00:05:20.400> that<00:05:20.880> when<00:05:21.000> you<00:05:21.090> change<00:05:21.449> gear<00:05:21.720> with<00:05:21.870> the

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
is that when you change gear with the

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.469 
is that when you change gear with the
quick<00:05:22.139> shifter<00:05:22.530> it's<00:05:22.949> very<00:05:23.130> smooth<00:05:23.970> and<00:05:24.240> quick

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 
quick shifter it's very smooth and quick

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:26.330 
quick shifter it's very smooth and quick
you<00:05:25.320> know<00:05:25.380> you<00:05:25.500> don't<00:05:25.650> have<00:05:25.860> to<00:05:25.979> back<00:05:26.099> off<00:05:26.250> the

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
you know you don't have to back off the

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.400 
you know you don't have to back off the
throttle<00:05:26.370> and<00:05:26.820> you<00:05:27.240> can<00:05:27.389> do<00:05:27.510> that<00:05:27.690> under<00:05:27.930> high

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.410 
throttle and you can do that under high

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.290

better you know it feels its same
character<00:07:19.419> the<00:07:19.570> sound<00:07:19.870> is<00:07:20.140> better<00:07:20.290> that's<00:07:20.650> a

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:20.740 
character the sound is better that's a

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:22.860 
character the sound is better that's a
subjective<00:07:20.950> judgment<00:07:21.610> but<00:07:22.300> that<00:07:22.450> perhaps<00:07:22.630> the

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:22.870 
subjective judgment but that perhaps the

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:25.170 
subjective judgment but that perhaps the
biggest<00:07:23.080> difference<00:07:23.380> you<00:07:23.740> notice<00:07:24.130> is<00:07:24.370> the<00:07:25.060> way

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:25.180 
biggest difference you notice is the way

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:27.990 
biggest difference you notice is the way
the<00:07:25.330> bike<00:07:25.480> handles<00:07:26.310> because<00:07:27.310> of<00:07:27.460> the<00:07:27.640> the<00:07:27.669> new

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:28.000 
the bike handles because of the the new

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.090 
the bike handles because of the the new
exhaust<00:07:28.330> system<00:07:28.450> so<00:07:29.290> redistributes<00:07:30.010> the

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:30.100 
exhaust system so redistributes the

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:31.650 
exhaust system so redistributes the
weight<00:07:30.310> the<00:07:30.790> whole<00:07:30.910> bikes<00:07:31.180> a<00:07:31.300> bit<00:07:31.419> lighter

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:31.660 
weight the whole bikes a bit lighter

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:34.380 
weight the whole bikes a bit lighter
we've<00:07:32.320> changed<00:07:32.590> the<00:07:32.710> geometry<00:07:33.240> the<00:07:34.240> end

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:34.390 
we've changed the geometry the end

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:35.850 
we've changed the geometry the end
result<00:07:34.690> of<00:07:34.810> all<00:07:34.900> that<00:07:34.960> is<00:07:35.260> the<00:07:35.350> bike<00:07:35.530> feels

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:35.860 
result of all that is the bike feels

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:37.980 
result of all that is the bike feels
much<00:07:36.580> more<00:07:36.760> agile<00:07:36.970> so<00:07:37.390> it<00:07:37.480> goes<00:07:37.660> into<00:07:37.900> the

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:37.990 
much more agile so it goes into the

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:40.380 
much more agile so it goes into the
corners<00:07:38.380> more<00:07:38.800> easily<00:07:39.100> and<00:07:39.310> then<00:07:40.000> once<00:07:40.210> you're

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:40.390 
corners more easily and then once you're

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:43.020 
corners more easily and then once you're
in<00:07:40.600> the<00:07:40.780> corner<00:07:41.169> really<00:07:41.550> committing<00:07:42.550> to

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:43.030 
in the corner really committing to

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:44.730 
in the corner really committing to
riding<00:07:43.390> fast<00:07:43.660> around<00:07:43.780> a<00:07:43.930> corner<00:07:44.140> you<00:07:44.530> feel

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:44.740 
riding fast around a corner you feel

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:46.679 
riding fast around a corner you feel
much<00:07:44.980> more<00:07:45.280> secure<00:07:45.340> and<00:07:45.940> comfort

00:07:46.679 --> 00:07:46.689 
much more secure and comfort

00:07:46.689 --> 00:07:49.079 
much more secure and comfort
the<00:07:47.259> bike<00:07:47.439> feels<00:07:47.679> what<00:07:48.339> we<00:07:48.459> say<00:07:48.639> in<00:07:48.819> English
