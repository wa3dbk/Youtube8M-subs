00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:07.860
 Sometimes a breakthrough is needed not for genius but for a madman. For example, in 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.890
 Dr. Fluke Hawkins, who is misunderstood by the scientific body 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.700
 he is building a space station to cut himself off from the harassing scientists. 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.620
 He takes his conservator with flat surfaces, Kurt, who agrees 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.890
 to go into space in exchange for a plate of Hungarian goulash. Out of boredom 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.920
 he also builds a cybernetic dog, Bones, and "coil suit" - revolutionary armor 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.220
 ring-shaped able to resist bullets, bees and even a small ale 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.890
 very hard sticks. Ah, an insignificant detail can also be 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.210
 the fact that while Kurt and Dr. Fluke are flying in space, planet earth 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.010
 they're decimating Combine harvesters, interstellar metropolises connecting theirs 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.770
 residential spacecraft and raw material chiller. other 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.480
 words, invasion of strangers. Kurt assumes so created with the thought of 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.420
 them outfit and embarks on the mission of providing courtesy. 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.120
 Sounds like drunken dreams? Won the authors, because I just summarized you 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:14.620
 introduction to the MDK game manual, which hit the year 1997 on PCs and 1998 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.230
 on PlayStation 1. For a long time I felt like recalling this one 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.470
 title because of its specific atmosphere, because it's hard to close it in 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.360
 some simple frames and describe without directly referring to it, 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:33.060
 what's happening on the screen. Let's start with the basics. The game is divided into missions, 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.920
 which start with a brief briefing by Dr. Hawkins. Explain 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.530
 us in which place another harvester was noticed and then sends us in 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.800
 way. Because we are in orbit, and hostile vehicles on the ground, 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.850
 our first task in most missions is to reach the ship. 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.160
 In this simple playable section, we avoid radar and incoming enemy rockets 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.410
 picking up the discarded items. Then we go to 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.290
 the main part and from this moment MDK transforms into very much 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.210
 unconventional TPS. The first thing that catches the eye and falls into the earliest 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.580
 memory is the specific style of the game. The title perfectly reflects a very foreign nature 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.380
 invaders' vehicles. The boards are not just robotic, they are presented 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.390
 in an extremely abstract and surreal way, bringing to mind 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.550
 a combination of The Neverhood with Tim Burton's films and Salvador Dali's paintings. 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.600
 Levels are built entirely deliberately in a way completely detached from 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.020
 reality, almost oneiric. Traveling them is like a nightmare 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.460
 sleepy - in an instant we are in a rectangular room that looks like a stage 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.510
 murders of a group of clowns, then we run on glass platforms 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.840
 suspended in space, to later move along long, metallic ones 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.360
 corridors. Some of the locations are so abstract that they are traversing on 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:57.160
 full screen with the nose in the monitor brings to nystagmus. Design is 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.800
 so an extremely strong side of the game. It accompanies everything to it perfectly 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:06.090
 selected symphonic music and ascetically used effects 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.680
 sound enhancing the impression of strangeness and the all-embracing cosmic void. 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.290
 The innovative gameplay is equally specific. Kurt's main weapon is 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.240
 machine gun mounted in the hero's costume arm. if 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.090
 take a good look, you will see that his helmet is in the shape of a drop. All 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.170
 the character's design resembles a humanized version of the iconic alien 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:34.030
 and it's hard not to feel the specific climate of Ridley Scott's series here. Returning 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.570
 however, for headgear - it has a special function, because it allows 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.000
 mount Kurt's gun on his face, transforming himself into this way 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.840
 mounted on the head of a sniper rifle. In this precise donating mode 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.080
 fire, at the top of the screen there are three preview windows of missiles 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.690
 we shoot, the type of loaded ammunition is displayed on the left, and the right one is displayed 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.880
 the approximation that can be achieved even by one hundred times the standard vision. 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.090
 Some sections of the game are forcing us to use the sniper mode, on 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.950
 example in the form of accuracy tests or short logic games. Interestingly, to 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.520
 guns can load not only standard ammunition, but also 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.200
 grenades or homing missiles. The impressive aspect of the game engine is 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.640
 also the fact that this mode allows us to glance at the other end of the map without 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.780
 recharge resources or texture pop-ups. In those 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:31.390
 MDK times were a technical miracle. One thing is funny here in this context 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.710
 curiosity. All objects with missiles, opponents and finders on 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:40.400
 the foreheads are rendered in three dimensions. All ... except the main one 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:45.960
 a hero who in the tps sections is a two-dimensional sprite. Kurt owned 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.020
 also the possibility of opening a special parachute, which 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.690
 made it possible to cover long distances or fly in the air 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.570
 in the wind. Thanks to this mechanics, level designers could 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.360
 create really wide or vertical boards, as in standard ones 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.070
 games of this type would not be possible. If at this stage you think that MDK is 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:08.880
 strange, I assure you that we have not even reached halfway yet, 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.610
 ekhm, the specificity of this game. 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.010
 Let's take a closer look at Kurt's armor and the finders we can pick up 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:18.960
 on the way. During our mission, we will come across "The Most Cowardly 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.920
 Power of the World "- a first aid kit that escapes from the player. The door is not 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.850
 we open with keys and throwing barrels containing them 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:32.210
 "The smallest nuclear explosions in the world". If we're surrounded by opponents, 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.940
 we can throw a cushion in the form of a balloon with it drawn 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:40.680
 a marker with the silhouette of a hero who will distract them. Or even better - 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:45.390
 arm yourself with the "Most Interesting Bomb of the World", a can of a pandora, which is not only 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.210
 will force their curiosity to look at what is inside, but by the way 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:53.600
 he will kill them on the spot. Are not these ideas straight from Monty's skits 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:58.680
 Python? And there are many more such flavors, but I will leave it for another 

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:59.530
 opportunity. 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.150
 In every mission Kurt's task is to reach the heart of the ship and murder 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:09.600
 commanding him a stranger during a classic boss-fight. Along the way, though 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.640
 I may have presented the game as a pure shooter, but it is waiting for us too 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.610
 many other tasks and simple logic puzzles. We will bombard 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.250
 enemies, slide on the board in a pursuit scene straight out of Bond, and sometimes 

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:25.370
 we will have to move our heads and, for example, sneak between enemies in 

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:27.620
 the crap of the murdered robot. 

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:32.080
 Unfortunately, because the game has its years, he likes to play tricks with new computers, 

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:36.040
 hence small graphic errors in the gameplay you are watching. 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:41.640
 At times, the game works without any problems, and sometimes yes. Well, at least mine 

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:46.280
 the computer meets the hardware requirements reaching 242% of the processor's performance 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:48.550
 Pentium Pro 200! 

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:54.510
 Ah, and there's the question of the title. MDK. What does this mysterious abbreviation mean? Legend 

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:59.220
 there are hundreds of them, and the authors themselves like to change their minds in this matter. Supposedly 

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:04.720
 MDK was meant to mean "Murder, Death, Kill", the instruction jokingly points to 

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:09.660
 "Mission: Deliver Kindness", and the installer of the second part of the game has been offering in the background 

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:11.670
 dozens of other developments. 

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.890
 As for the second MDK, I am reluctant to speak, because in my opinion 

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:19.830
 it has inspired a large part of the specific climate of its one 

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:22.400
 candy-free candy. 

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:29.230
 If you lasted until the end, a small bonus in the form of ending the game. Calmly, 

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:34.180
 is unspoiled, because it turns out to be ... a music video of the French band Billy 

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:38.940
 Ze Kick. I said it would be even stranger. Do not try to look here 

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:41.460
 some ... deeper meaning.
