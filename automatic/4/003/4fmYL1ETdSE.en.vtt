 today we will subsidize some 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.689
 functions of different smartphones she 

00:00:10.689 --> 00:00:12.719
 but ever used before 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:13.589

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:19.939
 OK 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:22.039

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:24.179
 called smart phones 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:25.250
 so clear 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.660
 in the meantime, maybe so called because 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.699
 that they are smarter than theirs at 11 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:33.090

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.490
