00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:02.980 
convenient it's easy to load a little

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.690 
convenient it's easy to load a little
fast<00:01:03.360> so<00:01:04.590> same<00:01:05.590> setup<00:01:05.860> as<00:01:06.070> the<00:01:06.250> ones<00:01:06.460> before

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700

fast so same setup as the ones before
there's<00:01:07.240> a<00:01:07.300> cart<00:01:07.660> back<00:01:08.260> in<00:01:08.440> the<00:01:08.500> corner<00:01:08.860> of<00:01:09.130> the

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
there's a cart back in the corner of the

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.240 
there's a cart back in the corner of the
pushin<00:01:09.729> it<00:01:09.820> partially<00:01:10.180> out<00:01:10.600> that<00:01:10.900> bottom<00:01:11.290> mine

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
pushin it partially out that bottom mine

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.430 
pushin it partially out that bottom mine
cart<00:01:12.550> so<00:01:12.880> when<00:01:13.030> you<00:01:13.150> get<00:01:13.300> the<00:01:13.420> piston<00:01:13.630> it<00:01:14.080> sends

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 
cart so when you get the piston it sends

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.490 
cart so when you get the piston it sends
up<00:01:14.530> one<00:01:14.770> card<00:01:15.090> pops<00:01:16.090> up<00:01:16.360> here<00:01:16.600> through<00:01:16.900> the

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
up one card pops up here through the

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.620 
up one card pops up here through the
bottom<00:01:17.800> of<00:01:17.890> that<00:01:17.979> piston<00:01:18.400> and<00:01:18.550> then<00:01:19.510> when

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
bottom of that piston and then when

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.180 
bottom of that piston and then when
you're<00:01:19.750> ready<00:01:19.810> to<00:01:20.110> go<00:01:20.229> it'll<00:01:20.560> send<00:01:20.800> you<00:01:20.920> on<00:01:21.070> the

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
you're ready to go it'll send you on the

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.700 
you're ready to go it'll send you on the
way<00:01:21.369> if<00:01:21.790> you<00:01:22.450> don't<00:01:22.720> have<00:01:22.930> a<00:01:22.960> writer<00:01:23.260> it'll

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
way if you don't have a writer it'll

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.749 
way if you don't have a writer it'll
fall<00:01:23.950> back<00:01:24.190> into<00:01:24.550> the<00:01:25.090> pez<00:01:25.270> dispenser<00:01:26.430> so<00:01:27.430> it

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 
fall back into the pez dispenser so it

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:31.440 
fall back into the pez dispenser so it
almost<00:01:27.970> makes<00:01:28.540> it<00:01:28.750> up<00:01:28.869> there<00:01:29.229> but<00:01:29.560> I<00:01:30.450> think

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
almost makes it up there but I think

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:32.820 
almost makes it up there but I think
that'll<00:01:31.690> be<00:01:31.720> ok<00:01:31.810> if<00:01:32.080> that<00:01:32.320> doesn't<00:01:32.560> work<00:01:32.590> I'll

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
that'll be ok if that doesn't work I'll

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.800 
that'll be ok if that doesn't work I'll
just<00:01:32.979> add<00:01:33.160> one<00:01:33.310> more<00:01:34.110> or<00:01:35.110> more<00:01:35.380> step<00:01:35.860> here<00:01:36.810> it's

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
just add one more or more step here it's

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:44.700 
just add one more or more step here it's
it's<00:01:38.259> real<00:01:38.560> close<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:42.960> bunch<00:01:43.960> of<00:01:44.080> redstone<00:01:44.410> to

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
it's real close a bunch of redstone to

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.430 
it's real close a bunch of redstone to
do<00:01:44.830> but<00:01:45.100> we<00:01:45.970> have<00:01:46.090> five<00:01:46.360> destinations<00:01:46.720> here

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
do but we have five destinations here

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.749 
do but we have five destinations here
just<00:01:47.710> because<00:01:47.890> it<00:01:48.100> will<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:49.240> layout<00:01:49.660> here

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
just because it will the layout here

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.359 
just because it will the layout here
symmetry<00:01:51.759> and<00:01:51.850> all<00:01:51.970> that<00:01:52.470> so<00:01:53.470> I<00:01:53.530> had<00:01:53.950> an<00:01:54.070> extra

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
symmetry and all that so I had an extra

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:59.840 
symmetry and all that so I had an extra
one<00:01:54.490> here<00:01:54.700> but<00:01:56.520> ok<00:01:57.520> thanks<00:01:58.300> for<00:01:58.360> watching<00:01:58.750> this
