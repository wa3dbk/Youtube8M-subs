00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.589
 hello my ladies and gentlemen heartily 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.750
 welcome to this video finally goes 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.000
 make it again at www.tk fifteen 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.759
 So somehow they do not really come 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.370
 infos what annoys me pretty much or 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.800
 shit, but good you can 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.779
 did not change clearly so a few things came 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.580
 again the universe was fashion 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.949
 also announced but somehow just like that 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.350
 there is not more universe mode so yes 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.760
 really or it did not 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.070
 presented as accurately as it was then 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.579
 at ford him that was essential 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.380
 better regulated and the rust there 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.840
 Although already longer but somehow 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.980
 I think that's not quite final 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.570
 it will somehow be that 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.530
 smallest roadster for 100 years but 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.000
 Well, we will see 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.520
 but now it's time for the michael 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.110
 remote because now finally something was 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.270
 decent for the tangible 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.329
 announced what is new and this 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.670
 There are now really neat ones 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.550
 info next to the universe mode joke in 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.309
 the top 15 also the michael remote 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.170
 gamer as a career mode order the 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.030
 but a little different than that 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.510
 career mode this in which it is in the 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.380
 old smackdown vs. raw play gave 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.380
 or there is still there 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.150
 but now the new michael remote 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.520
 you start with a self-made one 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.470
 superstar that means you just created 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.970
 impressions youth its own to pasta 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.979
 I always find that very cool and play 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.950
 then just with the complete career 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.240
 through and the goal of this career is 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.270
 it's the wwe world heavyweight 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.880
 win championship title 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.500
 So that's the big goal, the 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.880
 but probably not 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.850
 I will be reached quickly 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.369
 starts first of all in the wwe 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.399
 performance center in orlando and will 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.320
 There formed by form of mod 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.820
 that will be so that you without 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.640
 spectators just in the ring is around 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.810
 pattern tasks fulfill one 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.420
 be made that will probably something like 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.189
 look like now in the stalins of 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.079
 wrestlemania mode this bonus is my goal 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.170
 I assume that it looks like that 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:03.780
 and yes, you just have to quasi one 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.350
 training to complete at form mod to 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.360
 demonstrate 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.429
 I see it and if you give the 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.799
 create and this 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:14.040
 Successfully complete goals then comes 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:15.390
 one to alex team under the direction then 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.459
 probably go from the milieu bar 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.689
 I'm assuming and then just in 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:22.530
 The nxp show shows what you can do 

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:25.349
 since it is off target one more time after 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.079
 The principle one simply has to 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:30.799
 prove that you are good among others 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:34.109
 then just against rouseff and bordelle and 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:36.209
 Of course , other countries like him 

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:37.709
 while nxp are and if you are too 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:41.040
 creates and the attention of 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:43.560
 tripple wins then you just get in 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.889
 the wwe mail rosta there is then vickie 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:51.120
 Guerrero's the general manager 

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:54.359
 dj manager better said and then 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.500
 I just set the one just goals 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:59.060
 ask me a thousand times 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.200
 then it just sets one's goals and goals 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.700
 with that a little bit different then there 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.079
 there is not only there is not there 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:09.209
 as many as just at the beginning of this 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:11.489
 www performance center but fights 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:14.699
 you just normally builds feuds 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.599
 on and, indeed, friendships with 

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:18.209
 other computers 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:19.650
 You can play as a face and as a goal 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.959
 So depending on how you look 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.489
 one behaves just face or here 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.290
 if , for example, this is one of them 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:27.269
 then handshake gets proposed 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.810
 So you can either have it 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:32.189
 respond to it or, for example, too 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.379
 reject or give a blo blouse or 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:36.030
 I do not know what you can do 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:37.739
 after how to behave yourself 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.180
 bright or to face what I develop 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.009
 I think it's pretty cool 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.259
 it also works the way you look 

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:44.939
 that introduces 

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:45.989
 and yes you can build in the Alliance or 

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:48.030
 rivalries 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.919
 You can also order the real estate 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.750
 championship and the intercontinental 

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:54.239
 fight championship even if that 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.939
 main goal is still the wwe world 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:04:00.470
 heavyweight champion is wwe world 

00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:04.680
 heavyweight championship is and 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:07.019
 of course also pay per views at paris 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.629
 be there and get into the main event 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:11.159
 and as much as I got that 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:12.979
 you can either at summerslam or 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:15.599
 at wrestlemania then the wwe world 

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:16.620
 That's exactly how I get that championship 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:18.329
 but not noticed but that will 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.990
 of course cool then with his 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:23.970
 own wrestler wrestlemania 

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:25.230
 zoom an event how do you say no 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.400
 Idea at the main event of wrestlemania 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:30.720
 to take part 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:32.970
 that would definitely be out of this and that 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.700
 the story can change as well 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.860
 depending on how you act depending on how 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:40.350
 you behave and just a lot or face 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:46.830
 should that also the replay value of the 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:47.910
 michael mootz strongly strong come to good 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.310
 Now I have the sentence differently 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.710
 started when I stopped but 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.080
 No matter, I think you've heard something 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.890
 I wanted to say that 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.750
 It should also be 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.820
 Surprises and turns in the 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.530
 give a story 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:04.320
 if that is really how it will be 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.910
 we then see that sounds on the 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.500
 paper everything pretty cool if I 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.480
 I'm honest, I'm real 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.130
 For a long time you wanted that mode 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:15.500
 from such a very small wrestler 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:19.050
 just become a big known superstar 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.400
 work up , therefore, also great 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.370
 looking forward to the mode and am pleased 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.780
 Huge it is really a horny mode but 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.870
 I'm still skeptical anyway 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:30.450
 because I somehow do not think that's it 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:32.940
 everything is going to be as cool as I am here 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:34.080
 but maybe read the paper 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.690
 it will be so maybe I am 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:39.690
 just a bit too skeptical 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:41.670
 with wwe fifteen because somehow so long 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:43.890
 because the info is all keep to themselves 

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:45.360
 Now it takes a long time until there is something 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:48.930
 decent but good we will 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:51.780
 in the end see who turn www tk 15 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:52.620
 comes out and that's it so far now 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.540
 from me too 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.520
 I think soon but also smell 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:06:00.810
 once again give a video to the roadster 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:02.940
 because well second ten ladies was on 31 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:06.950
 10 is yes if I informed correctly 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:11.090
 I am for the xbox 360 and ps3 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:13.110
 so that's not so long anymore 

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.700
 maybe the grid will stay as it is 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:16.110
 is good 

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.130
 So that was it from me we'll see each other 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:19.830
 then hopefully next time 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:21.810
 again with more nice information about wwe 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:24.410
 tk 15 until then stay tuned 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:24.410
 and bye
