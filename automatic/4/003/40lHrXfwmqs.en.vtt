00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.020 
you notice the little characters around

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.050 
you notice the little characters around
here<00:01:14.350> are<00:01:14.530> from<00:01:14.710> the<00:01:14.890> themes<00:01:15.160> in<00:01:15.370> the<00:01:15.400> past<00:01:15.730> so

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
here are from the themes in the past so

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.820 
here are from the themes in the past so
if<00:01:16.480> you<00:01:16.630> remember<00:01:16.900> that<00:01:17.020> that<00:01:17.230> was<00:01:17.320> the<00:01:17.440> forest

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 
if you remember that that was the forest

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.550 
if you remember that that was the forest
theme<00:01:17.980> this<00:01:18.190> was<00:01:18.370> the<00:01:18.520> zodiacs<00:01:19.030> the<00:01:19.720> French<00:01:20.140> I

don't really fit in my screen you can

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:02.530 
don't really fit in my screen you can
probably<00:02:01.430> see<00:02:01.670> a<00:02:01.700> better<00:02:01.880> comparison<00:02:02.240> on

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
probably see a better comparison on

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.749 
probably see a better comparison on
Abby's<00:02:02.930> channel<00:02:03.350> but<00:02:03.830> basically<00:02:04.220> as<00:02:04.490> you<00:02:04.640> can

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
Abby's channel but basically as you can

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:07.030 
Abby's channel but basically as you can
see<00:02:04.970> the<00:02:05.090> large<00:02:05.270> memo<00:02:05.540> pads<00:02:05.840> are<00:02:06.229> slightly

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
see the large memo pads are slightly

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.980 
see the large memo pads are slightly
bigger<00:02:07.310> than<00:02:07.430> the<00:02:07.610> media<00:02:07.909> this<00:02:08.509> is<00:02:08.660> actually

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
bigger than the media this is actually

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.170 
bigger than the media this is actually
