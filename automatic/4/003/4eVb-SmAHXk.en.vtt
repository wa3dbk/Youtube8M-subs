example my name is Sony Xperia tipo and

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:03.189 
example my name is Sony Xperia tipo and
then<00:04:01.400> if<00:04:01.669> that<00:04:01.849> pops<00:04:02.060> up<00:04:02.239> they<00:04:02.660> can<00:04:02.840> click<00:04:03.079> on

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:03.199 
then if that pops up they can click on

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:04.599 
then if that pops up they can click on
it<00:04:03.319> and<00:04:03.349> they<00:04:03.590> can<00:04:03.620> type<00:04:03.889> in<00:04:04.069> the<00:04:04.160> password<00:04:04.340> and

it and they can type in the password and
they<00:04:04.699> can<00:04:04.879> join<00:04:05.349> and<00:04:06.349> then<00:04:06.620> obviously<00:04:06.769> what

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
they can join and then obviously what

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.900 
they can join and then obviously what
you<00:04:07.280> do<00:04:07.459> is<00:04:07.930> once<00:04:08.930> you<00:04:09.019> have<00:04:09.079> that<00:04:09.290> set<00:04:09.530> up<00:04:09.910> it

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
you do is once you have that set up it

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.690 
you do is once you have that set up it
says<00:04:11.180> here<00:04:11.829> and<00:04:12.829> possible<00:04:13.430> active

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
says here and possible active

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.280 
says here and possible active
and<00:04:15.209> so<00:04:15.660> if<00:04:16.519> and<00:04:17.519> then<00:04:17.760> they<00:04:18.600> go<00:04:18.810> into<00:04:18.989> their

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
and so if and then they go into their

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.610 
and so if and then they go into their
Wi-Fi<00:04:20.010> settings<00:04:20.400> they<00:04:20.639> join<00:04:20.940> and<00:04:21.269> if<00:04:22.260> it<00:04:22.410> says

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
Wi-Fi settings they join and if it says

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.950 
Wi-Fi settings they join and if it says
connected<00:04:23.250> then<00:04:23.460> it's<00:04:23.610> all<00:04:23.760> working<00:04:24.030> if<00:04:24.720> it's

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
connected then it's all working if it's

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.720 
connected then it's all working if it's
not<00:04:25.340> then<00:04:26.340> you<00:04:26.490> might<00:04:26.610> have<00:04:26.760> to<00:04:26.910> try<00:04:27.150> again<00:04:27.350> and

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:28.730 
not then you might have to try again and

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:32.360 
not then you might have to try again and
but<00:04:29.810> it<00:04:30.810> should<00:04:31.200> work<00:04:31.230> and<00:04:31.770> then<00:04:31.950> all<00:04:32.070> you<00:04:32.220> have

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
but it should work and then all you have

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.090 
but it should work and then all you have
to<00:04:32.400> do<00:04:32.669> is<00:04:33.240> pretty<00:04:34.020> much<00:04:34.169> just<00:04:34.440> blew<00:04:34.800> up<00:04:34.950> your

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
to do is pretty much just blew up your

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.970 
to do is pretty much just blew up your
