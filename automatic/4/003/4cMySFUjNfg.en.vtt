00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 hello youtube played funny 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:07.919
 smiley and today I will show the plug part 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.940
 show this we can add shop on 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.550
 your server 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.410
 It is divided into two types of admin noise and shock 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.210
 for the player now I will show how to do 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.920
 admin noise on the first line we write admin 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.750
 sob 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.330
 so on the second line we write a rat 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.789
 items that is how much we are under what they 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.859
 sell in quantities on the third 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.160
 line we write for why we will sell 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.030
 write b and then how much will we sell 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.260
 let's for example 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.030
 15 and can pass to the next line 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.670
 but if you want more 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.760
 sold this item 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:51.570
 write with and preferably less 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:54.570
 than b14 the next line the next 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:58.379
 line write id block we will 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.899
 let's sell for example cards all on 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.629
 report that the store has been successfully created in 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.199
 the window was written so now I will show how 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.080
 to make 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.229
 the noise of the player we definitely need a chest 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:13.110
 put it under the sign and put a sign 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:19.100
 and on the first line place a bag of food 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:22.259
 Us books so on write all the same 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:29.100
 depending on what you are selling so 15 we sell to 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:29.430
 15 swim for 14 and give this quartz 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.310
 block 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.079
 all consciously and if later comes up and 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.549
 will buy from us he will not buy anything 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.670
 since it will be written that 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.610
 item you ended up for this us 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:45.390
 we need a chest in this chest we place that thing 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.640
 whom we sell now everything any 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.140
 the player may come up to buy and as long as things 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.360
 will not end you will be shown 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.280
 money for what players buy you this 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.159
