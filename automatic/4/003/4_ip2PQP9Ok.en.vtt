first time we've seen a team complete
and<00:00:06.000> now<00:00:06.330> test<00:00:06.690> the<00:00:07.020> new<00:00:07.470> car<00:00:07.740> of<00:00:07.770> the<00:00:07.950> future

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
and now test the new car of the future

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.370 
and now test the new car of the future
and<00:00:08.519> this<00:00:08.820> is<00:00:08.970> it<00:00:09.090> triple<00:00:09.420> 8<00:00:09.510> engineering<00:00:10.110> have

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
and this is it triple 8 engineering have

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.530 
and this is it triple 8 engineering have
been<00:00:10.559> the<00:00:10.679> first<00:00:10.830> a<00:00:11.070> complete<00:00:11.460> one<00:00:11.639> now<00:00:12.090> a<00:00:12.330> lot

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
been the first a complete one now a lot

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.060 
been the first a complete one now a lot
of<00:00:12.570> people<00:00:12.780> have<00:00:13.019> said<00:00:13.230> to<00:00:13.349> me<00:00:13.500> after<00:00:13.860> seeing

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
of people have said to me after seeing

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.560 
of people have said to me after seeing
the<00:00:14.219> car<00:00:14.400> previewed<00:00:14.820> at<00:00:14.910> Sydney<00:00:15.150> last<00:00:15.360> year

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
the car previewed at Sydney last year

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.170 
the car previewed at Sydney last year
they<00:00:15.990> actually<00:00:16.170> look<00:00:16.680> very<00:00:16.920> very<00:00:17.580> similar<00:00:17.880> to

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
they actually look very very similar to

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.939 
they actually look very very similar to
what<00:00:18.420> we've<00:00:18.750> got<00:00:18.960> now<00:00:19.109> so<00:00:19.320> why<00:00:19.470> car<00:00:19.740> of<00:00:19.830> the

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
what we've got now so why car of the

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.070 
what we've got now so why car of the
future<00:00:19.980> well<00:00:20.670> yes<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:21.029> wind<00:00:21.270> leak<00:00:21.539> surfaces

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
future well yes the wind leak surfaces

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.500 
future well yes the wind leak surfaces
are<00:00:22.260> similar<00:00:22.680> but<00:00:23.070> beneath<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.490> skin<00:00:23.939> let's

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
are similar but beneath the skin let's

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.880 
are similar but beneath the skin let's
undress<00:00:24.810> him<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:25.170> have<00:00:25.260> a<00:00:25.289> little<00:00:25.470> bit<00:00:25.710> of<00:00:25.740> a

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
undress him and have a little bit of a

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.859 
undress him and have a little bit of a
look<00:00:26.010> first<00:00:26.580> off<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:27.000> cab<00:00:27.180> off<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.359> rank<00:00:27.510> is

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
look first off the cab off the rank is

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.019 
look first off the cab off the rank is
if<00:00:27.990> you<00:00:28.080> have<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.199> look<00:00:28.320> inside

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
if you have a look inside

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:33.049 
if you have a look inside
cockpit<00:00:30.029> wise<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:31.080> driver<00:00:31.410> is<00:00:31.650> inboard<00:00:32.279> ok

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
cockpit wise the driver is inboard ok

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.299 
cockpit wise the driver is inboard ok
the<00:00:33.600> steering<00:00:34.050> column<00:00:34.230> now<00:00:34.530> is<00:00:34.800> collapsible

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
the steering column now is collapsible

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.430 
the steering column now is collapsible
so<00:00:35.520> it's<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.730> much<00:00:36.000> safer<00:00:36.270> car<00:00:36.660> now<00:00:37.110> all<00:00:37.290> this

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
so it's a much safer car now all this

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.619 
so it's a much safer car now all this
royal<00:00:37.739> cage<00:00:38.100> design<00:00:38.489> and<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.760> floor<00:00:39.059> fin<00:00:39.360> is

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
royal cage design and the floor fin is

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.990 
royal cage design and the floor fin is
common<00:00:40.379> across<00:00:40.469> all<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.010> cars<00:00:41.219> but<00:00:41.460> cleverly

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
common across all the cars but cleverly

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.049 
common across all the cars but cleverly
what<00:00:42.239> they've<00:00:42.420> done<00:00:42.719> what<00:00:43.620> we<00:00:43.739> call<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.399> B

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
what they've done what we call the a B

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.240 
what they've done what we call the a B
and<00:00:45.329> C<00:00:45.600> pillar<00:00:45.930> here<00:00:46.230> you<00:00:46.739> can<00:00:46.920> actually

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
and C pillar here you can actually

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.369 
and C pillar here you can actually
stitch<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:47.879> Nissen<00:00:48.360> one<00:00:48.660> on<00:00:48.809> there<00:00:49.020> or<00:00:49.320> a

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
stitch a Nissen one on there or a

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.229 
stitch a Nissen one on there or a
forward<00:00:49.829> one<00:00:49.980> on<00:00:50.129> there<00:00:50.309> or<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.520> Holden<00:00:50.969> or<00:00:51.059> any

forward one on there or a Holden or any
other<00:00:51.390> manufacturer<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:51.960> wants<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.260> come<00:00:52.379> and

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
other manufacturer it wants to come and

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.990 
other manufacturer it wants to come and
play<00:00:52.559> that's<00:00:53.160> very<00:00:53.430> very<00:00:53.579> clever

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
play that's very very clever

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.910 
play that's very very clever
now<00:00:54.329> I<00:00:54.510> want<00:00:54.690> to<00:00:54.750> talk<00:00:54.840> more<00:00:54.870> about<00:00:55.079> safety<00:00:55.739> if

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
now I want to talk more about safety if

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.560 
now I want to talk more about safety if
you<00:00:56.219> look<00:00:56.399> inside<00:00:56.760> here<00:00:57.000> you<00:00:57.090> might<00:00:57.270> recall

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
you look inside here you might recall

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.990 
you look inside here you might recall
the<00:00:57.750> old<00:00:57.780> v8<00:00:58.140> supercar<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:59.190> fuel<00:00:59.489> cell<00:00:59.730> is<00:00:59.760> in

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
the old v8 supercar the fuel cell is in

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.549 
the old v8 supercar the fuel cell is in
the<00:01:00.090> back<00:01:00.270> ear<00:01:00.449> member<00:01:00.719> car<00:01:00.899> Reinders<00:01:01.350> crash

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
the back ear member car Reinders crash

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.609 
the back ear member car Reinders crash
quite<00:01:02.129> dangerous<00:01:02.780> inside<00:01:03.780> here<00:01:04.049> now<00:01:04.080> under

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
quite dangerous inside here now under

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.440 
quite dangerous inside here now under
the<00:01:04.710> floor<00:01:04.979> is<00:01:05.220> where<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.670> fuel<00:01:05.939> cell<00:01:06.150> lives

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
the floor is where the fuel cell lives

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.300 
the floor is where the fuel cell lives
that<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.140> safest<00:01:07.590> place<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:08.010> can<00:01:08.130> be

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
that is the safest place it can be

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.710 
that is the safest place it can be
that's<00:01:08.520> actually<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.880> floor<00:01:09.090> that's<00:01:09.510> in

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
that's actually the floor that's in

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.929 
that's actually the floor that's in
underneath<00:01:09.990> there<00:01:10.320> let's<00:01:10.710> go<00:01:10.890> on<00:01:11.100> inside<00:01:11.729> the

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
underneath there let's go on inside the

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.039 
underneath there let's go on inside the
back<00:01:12.150> of<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.420> car<00:01:12.630> then<00:01:12.900> when<00:01:13.110> we<00:01:13.229> up<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.770> boot

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:15.049 
back of the car then when we up the boot

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:17.570 
back of the car then when we up the boot
inside<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.229> back<00:01:16.500> of<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:17.100> car<00:01:17.310> of<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.549> future

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
inside the back of the car of the future

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.120 
inside the back of the car of the future
all<00:01:18.390> this<00:01:18.720> is<00:01:18.869> now<00:01:19.020> what<00:01:19.290> we<00:01:19.409> call<00:01:19.590> crumple

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
all this is now what we call crumple

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.249 
all this is now what we call crumple
zone<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:20.549> it<00:01:20.670> can<00:01:20.820> absorb<00:01:21.210> energy<00:01:21.390> in<00:01:21.869> a

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
zone so it can absorb energy in a

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.289 
zone so it can absorb energy in a
rear-end<00:01:22.710> collision<00:01:22.770> but<00:01:23.610> I<00:01:23.820> want<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.150> show

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
rear-end collision but I want to show

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.520 
rear-end collision but I want to show
you<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.479> really<00:01:24.750> tricky<00:01:24.930> bits<00:01:25.259> when<00:01:25.409> you're

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
you the really tricky bits when you're

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.080 
you the really tricky bits when you're
getting<00:01:25.799> underneath<00:01:26.100> this<00:01:26.400> carb<00:01:26.670> is<00:01:26.909> where

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
getting underneath this carb is where

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.330 
getting underneath this carb is where
it's<00:01:27.180> really<00:01:27.450> clever<00:01:27.630> by<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.350> way<00:01:28.619> eight<00:01:29.159> in

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
it's really clever by the way eight in

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.010 
it's really clever by the way eight in
each<00:01:29.430> wheel<00:01:29.670> we<00:01:29.820> currently<00:01:30.000> use<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.329> 17<00:01:30.840> so

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
each wheel we currently use a 17 so

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.410 
each wheel we currently use a 17 so
Dunlop<00:01:31.439> has<00:01:31.560> made<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.770> range<00:01:32.189> of<00:01:32.700> 18<00:01:33.030> inch<00:01:33.150> tires

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
Dunlop has made a range of 18 inch tires

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.640 
Dunlop has made a range of 18 inch tires
that's<00:01:33.630> going<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.840> mean<00:01:33.990> more<00:01:34.170> grip<00:01:34.470> and

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
that's going to mean more grip and

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.010 
that's going to mean more grip and
better<00:01:34.799> racing<00:01:35.040> but<00:01:35.729> reef<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:36.509> wheel<00:01:36.840> off

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
better racing but reef that wheel off

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.289 
better racing but reef that wheel off
there<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.470> in<00:01:38.100> under<00:01:38.430> here<00:01:38.670> what's<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.180> it's

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
there and in under here what's it it's

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.420 
there and in under here what's it it's
sort<00:01:39.509> of<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.600> thing<00:01:39.780> here<00:01:40.020> that's<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.770> transaxle

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
sort of a thing here that's a transaxle

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.280 
sort of a thing here that's a transaxle
so<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.909> gearbox<00:01:42.390> has<00:01:42.570> effectively<00:01:43.079> moved

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
so the gearbox has effectively moved

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.350 
so the gearbox has effectively moved
down<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.829> back<00:01:44.100> of<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.399> car<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:44.909> it's<00:01:45.240> in

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
down to the back of the car and it's in

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.330 
down to the back of the car and it's in
there<00:01:45.509> with<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.780> differential<00:01:46.409> now<00:01:46.799> what<00:01:47.220> all

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
there with the differential now what all

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.359 
there with the differential now what all
that<00:01:47.520> means<00:01:47.850> is<00:01:48.290> the<00:01:49.290> car<00:01:49.560> is<00:01:49.860> gonna<00:01:50.070> lower

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
that means is the car is gonna lower

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.950 
that means is the car is gonna lower
center<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:50.759> gravity<00:01:50.820> it's<00:01:51.329> light<00:01:51.630> or<00:01:51.659> it's

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
center of gravity it's light or it's

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.300 
center of gravity it's light or it's
going<00:01:52.110> to<00:01:52.170> be<00:01:52.259> better<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.710> drive<00:01:52.860> better<00:01:53.130> for

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
going to be better to drive better for

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.830 
going to be better to drive better for
rookies<00:01:53.549> better<00:01:53.700> for<00:01:53.939> international<00:01:54.450> drivers

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
rookies better for international drivers

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.230 
rookies better for international drivers
but<00:01:55.350> smartest<00:01:55.860> of<00:01:55.950> all<00:01:56.130> they've<00:01:56.759> done<00:01:57.030> all<00:01:57.210> of

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
but smartest of all they've done all of

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.319 
but smartest of all they've done all of
this<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.990> car<00:01:58.200> is<00:01:58.320> 30%<00:01:58.880> cheaper<00:01:59.880> to<00:02:00.180> build

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
this and the car is 30% cheaper to build

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.259 
this and the car is 30% cheaper to build
well<00:02:01.020> done
