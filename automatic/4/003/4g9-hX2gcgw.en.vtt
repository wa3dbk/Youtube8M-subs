00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.169
 hello very good everyone I'm maximan and 

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:08.120
 we are here in a new video of gta 5 

00:00:06.169 --> 00:00:12.200
 online in which good I bring a new 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:14.090
 trick how to duplicate the tank one 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.120
 new way to duplicate the tank like this 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:20.360
 like having everything they want or one 

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:22.220
 for your friend, as it is not the first 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.010
 step we have is we need a 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:28.010
 friend that the most stuff your friend and 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.720
 so that I challenge you to a hard duel 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.880
 team of the individual I do not know how to 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.909
 they were in it in the same game 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.100
 It challenges you to one against one 

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:38.420
 have killed him then good he accepts is 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.050
 the challenge 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:44.870
 but we have to go for it now the 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.350
 same in the same duel we have to go to 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.789
 for him and kill him again and then he 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.589
 after having killed him once 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:54.530
 you just have to abandon it 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:56.820
 abandon it the came the game to 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.930
 death per team 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.510
 abandon the mission as you wish 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.450
 call him not then he leaves to see 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.130
 now now it's going to be like you're heading to 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.479
 individual death abandoned then already 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.979
 the abandonment of then under the 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.640
 left it sticks out its says that 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:18.570
 the vehicle will be turned back 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.280
 I again put it that becomes 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.920
 operative that you can return it to 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.750
 put then it 's like a clichÃ© like a 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.060
 an error of the game and then 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.159
 we call Pegasus again 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.990
 ask for the tag kerry no and then 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:35.319
 returns to leave this in which he reigned once 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.659
 put we're going to go after him once done 

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:40.179
 everything we had done before 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:42.819
 we call through pegasus and we 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:45.100
 put the location of our 

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:47.859
 new tank we have two tanks 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.049
 we can do the trick as many times as 

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:52.060
 we want we can have another 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:53.920
 tank we can have three tank four 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.240
 or five or six everything we want to 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.399
 all friends so you do not have 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.990
 money to buy the tank that stops 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:02.739
 who does not have at the tank level 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:05.289

00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:06.969

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:08.049

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:10.030
