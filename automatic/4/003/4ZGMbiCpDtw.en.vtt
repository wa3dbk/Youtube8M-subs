hi<00:00:02.510> this<00:00:03.510> is<00:00:03.659> the<00:00:03.810> very<00:00:04.049> first<00:00:04.380> video<00:00:05.279> review

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
hi this is the very first video review

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.910 
hi this is the very first video review
of<00:00:07.099> the<00:00:08.120> apex<00:00:09.200> X<00:00:10.200> DX

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:27.770 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:36.670

xt xt first age yoke or then see here is
a<00:00:56.180> very<00:00:56.449> unique<00:00:56.839> design<00:00:56.870> and<00:00:58.300> apex<00:01:00.010> said<00:01:01.010> that

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
a very unique design and apex said that

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.570 
a very unique design and apex said that
this<00:01:02.870> first<00:01:03.379> age<00:01:03.769> regulator<00:01:05.080> is<00:01:06.580> actually

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
this first age regulator is actually

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:15.160 
this first age regulator is actually
coated<00:01:08.090> with<00:01:11.170> hardened<00:01:12.170> materials<00:01:13.780> in<00:01:14.780> order

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
coated with hardened materials in order

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:23.820 
coated with hardened materials in order
to<00:01:15.580> produce<00:01:17.710> this<00:01:18.710> kind<00:01:19.130> of<00:01:19.340> toughness<00:01:22.270> it<00:01:23.270> has

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
to produce this kind of toughness it has

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:38.880 
to produce this kind of toughness it has
four<00:01:28.270> low<00:01:29.270> pressure<00:01:31.210> and<00:01:33.070> two<00:01:34.689> high<00:01:35.689> pressure

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:45.580 

one<00:01:39.890> in<00:01:40.070> each<00:01:40.219> side

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.130 

this<00:01:46.130> one<00:01:46.340> is<00:01:46.460> very<00:01:46.780> sensitive<00:01:48.520> for<00:01:49.520> the

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
this one is very sensitive for the

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.810 
this one is very sensitive for the
tastin<00:01:51.729> because<00:01:52.729> this<00:01:52.970> one<00:01:53.150> is<00:01:53.270> actually

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
tastin because this one is actually

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.890 
tastin because this one is actually
detecting<00:01:55.820> the<00:01:56.030> pressure<00:01:57.100> we're<00:01:58.100> in<00:01:58.750> when<00:01:59.750> you

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 
detecting the pressure we're in when you

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.580 
detecting the pressure we're in when you
are<00:01:59.930> in<00:02:00.259> a<00:02:00.350> deeper<00:02:00.740> dive<00:02:01.899> the<00:02:02.899> first<00:02:03.380> stage

are in a deeper dive the first stage

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.779 
are in a deeper dive the first stage
where<00:02:04.040> up<00:02:04.250> will<00:02:04.850> actually<00:02:06.460> provide<00:02:07.460> more<00:02:08.289> air

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
where up will actually provide more air

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:16.300 
where up will actually provide more air
to<00:02:10.789> the<00:02:11.500> second<00:02:12.500> stage<00:02:13.569> regulators<00:02:15.250> for<00:02:16.250> a

to the second stage regulators for a
good<00:02:16.489> bridge<00:02:17.019> now<00:02:20.500> this<00:02:21.500> is<00:02:21.590> my<00:02:21.800> unit<00:02:22.190> after

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
good bridge now this is my unit after

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:30.900 
good bridge now this is my unit after

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:42.030 

and<00:02:35.659> I<00:02:35.900> also<00:02:38.049> installed<00:02:39.049> a<00:02:39.909> swear<00:02:40.909> Bell

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
and I also installed a swear Bell

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:51.839 
and I also installed a swear Bell
connector<00:02:44.829> but<00:02:45.829> for<00:02:46.700> the<00:02:46.819> tungsten<00:02:50.739> this

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:51.849 
connector but for the tungsten this

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:55.899 
connector but for the tungsten this
beautiful<00:02:52.849> piece<00:02:53.239> of<00:02:54.700> second<00:02:55.700> state's

00:02:55.899 --> 00:02:55.909 
beautiful piece of second state's

00:02:55.909 --> 00:03:01.119 
beautiful piece of second state's
regular<00:02:57.400> as<00:02:58.400> you<00:02:58.549> can<00:02:58.730> see<00:02:58.909> actually<00:02:59.659> has<00:03:00.129> come

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:01.129 
regular as you can see actually has come

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:17.680 
regular as you can see actually has come
for<00:03:01.340> bite<00:03:12.549> set<00:03:13.549> here<00:03:14.560> prior<00:03:15.560> to<00:03:15.590> the<00:03:16.129> type<00:03:17.030> to

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
for bite set here prior to the type to

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:25.330 
for bite set here prior to the type to
prevent<00:03:22.239> unwanted

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:35.350 

over<00:03:26.340> bloah<00:03:27.290> and<00:03:28.290> it<00:03:28.799> has<00:03:29.040> an<00:03:32.870> error<00:03:33.870> system

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360
