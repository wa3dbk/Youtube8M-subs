just<00:01:37.590> need<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.770> dead<00:01:38.100> stand<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:39.329> actually<00:01:39.869> they

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
just need a dead stand and actually they

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.870 
just need a dead stand and actually they
make<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.439> riser<00:01:40.920> stand<00:01:41.310> that's<00:01:41.490> kind<00:01:41.700> of<00:01:41.759> like

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
make a riser stand that's kind of like

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.480 
make a riser stand that's kind of like
that<00:01:42.090> as<00:01:42.240> well<00:01:42.270> this<00:01:42.659> company<00:01:42.869> magma<00:01:43.350> but<00:01:43.799> that

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
that as well this company magma but that

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.740 
that as well this company magma but that
is<00:01:44.670> always<00:01:44.850> going<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.149> be<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.360> case<00:01:45.509> with<00:01:45.659> the

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
is always going to be the case with the

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.120 
is always going to be the case with the
stand<00:01:45.960> like<00:01:46.020> this<00:01:46.259> but<00:01:46.439> particularly<00:01:46.979> in<00:01:47.040> the

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
stand like this but particularly in the

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.109 
stand like this but particularly in the
case<00:01:47.250> of<00:01:47.310> this<00:01:47.520> one<00:01:47.579> because<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:48.060> this

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
case of this one because of this

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.359 
case of this one because of this
platform<00:01:48.600> at<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.780> front<00:01:49.020> well<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:49.740> can<00:01:49.890> put<00:01:50.100> a

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
platform at the front well you can put a

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.330 
platform at the front well you can put a
small<00:01:51.060> controller<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.930> a<00:01:52.079> chi<00:01:52.320> LPD<00:01:52.979> a<00:01:53.280> 2

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
small controller and a chi LPD a 2

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.069 
small controller and a chi LPD a 2
something<00:01:53.729> like<00:01:53.820> that<00:01:54.090> or<00:01:54.479> in<00:01:54.630> this<00:01:54.689> case<00:01:54.930> I've

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
something like that or in this case I've

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.020 
something like that or in this case I've
got<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.259> little<00:01:55.409> behringer<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.219> micro<00:01:56.610> but

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
got a little behringer and micro but

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.700 
got a little behringer and micro but
again<00:01:57.360> there's<00:01:57.840> going<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.020> be<00:01:58.079> wobbling<00:01:58.500> there

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
again there's going to be wobbling there

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.230 
again there's going to be wobbling there
so<00:01:58.979> you're<00:01:59.219> going<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.369> just<00:01:59.430> hardly<00:02:00.030> have<00:02:00.119> to

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
so you're going to just hardly have to

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.370 
so you're going to just hardly have to
get<00:02:00.360> used<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.659> that<00:02:00.719> it's<00:02:00.899> not<00:02:00.930> going<00:02:01.290> anywhere

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
get used to that it's not going anywhere

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.889 
get used to that it's not going anywhere
it's<00:02:01.860> all<00:02:02.310> completely<00:02:02.729> stable<00:02:03.270> what<00:02:03.689> you<00:02:03.780> have

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
it's all completely stable what you have

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.209 
it's all completely stable what you have
there<00:02:04.020> it's<00:02:04.140> all<00:02:04.259> completely<00:02:04.560> fixed<00:02:04.979> but<00:02:05.100> it

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
there it's all completely fixed but it

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.069 
there it's all completely fixed but it
isn't<00:02:05.549> exactly<00:02:05.969> stable<00:02:06.509> there<00:02:06.840> you<00:02:06.960> know

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
isn't exactly stable there you know

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.680 
isn't exactly stable there you know
however<00:02:07.740> when<00:02:08.310> you<00:02:08.429> put<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.729> clamps<00:02:09.209> on<00:02:09.360> it<00:02:09.420> at

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
however when you put the clamps on it at

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.990 
however when you put the clamps on it at
the<00:02:09.780> very<00:02:09.899> back<00:02:10.289> that<00:02:10.950> makes<00:02:11.190> it<00:02:11.370> considerably

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
the very back that makes it considerably

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.430 
the very back that makes it considerably
more<00:02:12.180> stable<00:02:12.599> when<00:02:12.690> you<00:02:12.720> clamp<00:02:12.989> it

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
more stable when you clamp it

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.740 
more stable when you clamp it
because<00:02:13.920> there's<00:02:14.130> one<00:02:14.340> third<00:02:14.940> of<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.270> u-shape

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
because there's one third of the u-shape

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.330 
because there's one third of the u-shape
if<00:02:15.900> you<00:02:16.020> like<00:02:16.200> has<00:02:16.590> been<00:02:16.770> taken<00:02:17.100> out<00:02:17.190> of<00:02:17.250> the

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
if you like has been taken out of the

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.970 
if you like has been taken out of the
equation<00:02:18.050> so<00:02:19.050> I<00:02:19.080> actually<00:02:19.290> really<00:02:19.590> like<00:02:19.830> this

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
equation so I actually really like this

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.250 
equation so I actually really like this
stand<00:02:20.310> it<00:02:20.880> comes<00:02:21.180> with<00:02:21.540> a<00:02:21.570> bag<00:02:21.810> like<00:02:21.990> this<00:02:22.200> and

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
stand it comes with a bag like this and

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.350 
stand it comes with a bag like this and
it<00:02:22.470> folds<00:02:22.800> down<00:02:22.950> into<00:02:23.010> its<00:02:23.550> padded<00:02:23.760> bag<00:02:24.090> it's

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
it folds down into its padded bag it's

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.450 
it folds down into its padded bag it's
got<00:02:24.480> a<00:02:24.540> zip<00:02:24.780> on<00:02:24.960> it<00:02:25.110> so<00:02:25.530> it's<00:02:25.710> just<00:02:25.770> as<00:02:26.100> easy<00:02:26.220> to

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
got a zip on it so it's just as easy to

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:27.860 
got a zip on it so it's just as easy to
carry<00:02:26.670> around<00:02:26.790> as<00:02:27.060> other<00:02:27.180> bags<00:02:27.390> maybe<00:02:27.660> not

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
carry around as other bags maybe not

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.960 
carry around as other bags maybe not
quite<00:02:28.020> as<00:02:28.290> lightweight<00:02:28.590> not<00:02:29.250> quite<00:02:29.520> as<00:02:29.700> tiny

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
quite as lightweight not quite as tiny

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.550 
quite as lightweight not quite as tiny
but<00:02:30.480> what<00:02:30.630> you're<00:02:30.810> getting<00:02:31.200> is<00:02:31.380> that

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
but what you're getting is that

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.140 
but what you're getting is that
flexibility<00:02:32.220> you're<00:02:32.850> getting<00:02:33.060> the

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
flexibility you're getting the

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.460 
flexibility you're getting the
adjustment<00:02:33.660> up<00:02:33.750> and<00:02:33.930> down<00:02:34.050> you're<00:02:34.290> getting

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
adjustment up and down you're getting

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.960 
adjustment up and down you're getting
the<00:02:34.530> extra<00:02:34.770> shelf<00:02:35.040> at<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.340> front<00:02:35.550> if<00:02:35.670> you<00:02:35.760> want

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
the extra shelf at the front if you want

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.700 
the extra shelf at the front if you want
to<00:02:36.090> and<00:02:36.510> for<00:02:36.630> all<00:02:36.750> those<00:02:36.900> things<00:02:37.200> especially

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
to and for all those things especially

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:38.840 
to and for all those things especially
for<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:37.920> price<00:02:38.130> it's<00:02:38.400> not<00:02:38.550> particularly

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
for the price it's not particularly

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.730 
for the price it's not particularly
expensive<00:02:39.300> it's<00:02:39.960> definitely<00:02:40.470> one<00:02:40.620> to

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
expensive it's definitely one to

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.770 
expensive it's definitely one to
consider<00:02:41.010> especially<00:02:41.340> if<00:02:42.180> you<00:02:42.360> do<00:02:42.540> have<00:02:42.750> a
