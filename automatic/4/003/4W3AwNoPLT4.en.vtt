00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:11.349
 hi girls then since i've been 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:12.970
 in new york you have so many 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:16.000
 asked to make a video about my beauty 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.410
 travel kit for travel 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.270
 long what I brought to 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.789
 all the little things beauty products 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.529
 that I took on the air so me 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:25.900
 I immediately gave everything that was 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:28.330
 all in this clutch in a di hello 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.039
 kitty that very old estimate had come out 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.779
 with the five doctor's collection 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.910
 years ago before then start doing 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:36.460
 But I like a lot of video and it still is 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.229
 among other things quite decent and therefore 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.089
 I'll show you all that 

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:41.710
 that there is the first thing I have inside 

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:43.780
 brought I used are the 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.580
 neither these services are wipes 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.589
 make-up removers are really fine 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.239
 also to clean only my face 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:51.489
 on the way I went to the role 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:53.110
 completely without make-up while returning e 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.540
 I put make-up on and then took off with 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.220
 these on the plane and these I need 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:00.699
 even if they are not rigged because 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.979
 precisely they clean the face and then that 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:05.470
 that I went to spread on the face is 

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:08.320
 a moisturizer because I don't know if 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.359
 have you noticed but the air that is in the plane 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.009
 dry the skin a lot 

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:13.960
 I felt my lips were pulling 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:15.969
 it then chases me and I skin it 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.869
 mixed I had new imagine if 

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:19.179
 you have dry skin 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:20.530
 bring absolutely absolutely you 

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:23.200
 moisturizing so 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:27.310
 that's why they sell in the catalog 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:29.649
 because many many times there is need 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.390
 really to moisturize the skin and I was 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:32.770
 really in a terrible state 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.929
 on investment leaders facts do not know 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.909
 what would I have done then why but 

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:39.219
 moisturizer that I brought is this 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:42.609
 complex a perfect hytractor this is 

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:44.740
 a very light gel therefore very fresh 

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:48.039
 it absolves super quickly and also one 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.020
 nice feeling of type of note 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:52.119
 reflection therefore a little awakens rocker 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.499
 in short I needed on the way then 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:54.969
 you maybe seven beautiful 

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:58.750
 I was really perfect there 

00:01:54.969 --> 00:02:00.220
 coma and so yes I brought this and then 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.110
 other thing that brought this instead 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.570
 to moisturize the lips is mine 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.330
 lip balm I will take christian dior 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.979
 I already told you about this is me 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.899
 is still enjoying a lot hydrated 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.460
 very good bra is very good 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.710
 also basic even as a basis for the 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.060
 lipstick but in this case one night 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.110
 exact for this medium but there it is 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.250
 council 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:23.709
 and then another thing I brought and this 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:26.200
 this perfection serum if not 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.300
 i'm wrong about something like the bike e 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.310
 I need this to remove the blushes 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.800
 that I always always have on my face if I am 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.230
 make-up you see a lot and then 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.300
 this helps me a little to conform 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.680
 the complexion mica One moment the skin 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.140
 because after removing makeup with e 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.170
 services and stored stockings becomes fiery red 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.239
 here and so I brought this too is 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.370
 nor is it really very little enough 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:51.040
 you see the difference when you see it 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.900
 I spend the night the next morning I see that 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.730
 yet the skin is much more uniform or 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.650
 much less blushing than something I don't have 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.370
 brought with me to Rome and I had to 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.690
 I absolutely must advise you are the 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:03.489
 eye and eye drops kitchens 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.440
 because even the eyes dry up a 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.450
 sack and I was sorry not to have them a 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.720
 the eyes also dry up on the edge 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:12.010
 so much is burning therefore in fact 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.320
 one photo I had passed had my eyes 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.450
 really very very red and therefore vi 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.690
 I suggest you also take the eye drops 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:22.780
 absolutely and then last thing I have 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:25.299
 brought with me is the powder this chanel 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:28.060
 which is a little bit opaque and this is it 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:30.540
 stretched right at speed 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.739
 on the plane to make it look more 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.570
 normal to my skin that it is 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:38.100
 always always so much as red 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:40.380
 ski ee also helped me a little with 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.630
 the glossy effect that however also in 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.700
 airplane check me it is not known how it is 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.370
 possible but also check me black and 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.410
 so I also wanted to bring this e 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:51.140
 with doing all the contents of the 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.950
 my beauty that we wanted to travel 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:57.180
 precisely without too many complications 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:58.790
 about makeup and various things in short 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.530
 I wanted to leave my skin 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.450
 breathe because it is already the journey itself 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.300
 for the skin it is quite stressful and 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.370
 then another so that I brought not 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:12.540
 it has a lot to do with beauty products 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.950
 but in my night mask 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.200
 in short, to cover the eyes because 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.000
 black there are always lights on and 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.520
 if i try to sleep with the lights on is 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.080
 there is an impossible thing is a cause 

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.500
 lost I can't sleep with light 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:26.040
 lit. 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:28.110
 so I brought you this too 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.000
 mask that I usually use at home for 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.730
 But being a mother was useful 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.650
 even on the plane and no girls this 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.750
 it was a bit like my travel beauty kit 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.970
 two other essential things are a 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:41.430
 pillow and a cover but never the le 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.900
 they have dates on the flight so if maybe 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.090
 inquire with your company 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.370
 aerial or take one of those 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.110
 pillows that are still comfortable though 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.270
 precisely I was fine with 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.370
 that of the airline and nothing 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:57.230
 boy and that's all for today kiss 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.230
 great and the next hello
