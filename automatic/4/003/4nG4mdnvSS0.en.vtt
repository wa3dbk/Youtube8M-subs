00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.210 
have the Revo three point three trainee
nothing<00:00:07.680> in<00:00:07.799> there

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
nothing in there

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.180 
nothing in there
mainly<00:00:08.639> just<00:00:08.849> for<00:00:09.059> the<00:00:09.150> party<00:00:09.389> up<00:00:09.599> front<00:00:10.190> no

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
mainly just for the party up front no

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.220 
mainly just for the party up front no
this<00:00:11.490> is<00:00:11.639> not<00:00:11.880> natural<00:00:12.150> fuel<00:00:12.630> burning<00:00:12.929> through

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
this is not natural fuel burning through

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.720 
this is not natural fuel burning through
everything<00:00:13.500> even<00:00:13.950> though<00:00:14.040> it<00:00:14.130> looks<00:00:14.400> just

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
everything even though it looks just

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.480 
everything even though it looks just
like<00:00:14.849> it<00:00:15.000> it's<00:00:15.870> a<00:00:16.170> performance<00:00:16.650> score<00:00:19.250> for<00:00:20.250> I

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
like it it's a performance score for I

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.290 
like it it's a performance score for I
guess<00:00:20.550> pcs<00:00:21.060> I<00:00:21.439> think<00:00:22.439> coolants<00:00:22.859> makes<00:00:23.160> it<00:00:23.430> just

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
guess pcs I think coolants makes it just

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.710 
guess pcs I think coolants makes it just
be<00:00:24.510> more<00:00:24.930> efficient<00:00:25.920> than<00:00:25.949> water

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 
be more efficient than water

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.810 
be more efficient than water
hopefully<00:00:27.720> or<00:00:28.050> I<00:00:28.560> have<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.949> max<00:00:29.189> Hampton<00:00:29.609> pump

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
hopefully or I have the max Hampton pump

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.209 
hopefully or I have the max Hampton pump
which<00:00:30.210> it<00:00:30.359> is<00:00:30.480> running<00:00:30.810> right<00:00:30.960> now<00:00:31.140> it's<00:00:32.040> not

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
which it is running right now it's not

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.420 
which it is running right now it's not
terribly<00:00:32.969> loud<00:00:33.239> but<00:00:33.750> I<00:00:34.020> mean<00:00:34.380> it's<00:00:35.160> quieter

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
terribly loud but I mean it's quieter

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.290 
terribly loud but I mean it's quieter
than<00:00:35.460> my<00:00:35.670> fans<00:00:35.910> were<00:00:36.230> um<00:00:37.230> I<00:00:37.890> have<00:00:38.129> point<00:00:38.489> 56<00:00:39.000> for

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
than my fans were um I have point 56 for

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.830 
than my fans were um I have point 56 for
braking<00:00:40.700> made<00:00:41.700> my<00:00:41.820> own<00:00:41.850> little<00:00:42.000> linkage<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.719> go

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
braking made my own little linkage to go

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.889 
braking made my own little linkage to go
over<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.079> top<00:00:43.550> so<00:00:44.550> full<00:00:45.120> throttle<00:00:45.510> doesn't<00:00:45.660> do

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
over the top so full throttle doesn't do

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.709 
over the top so full throttle doesn't do
anything<00:00:46.200> makes<00:00:47.039> it<00:00:47.190> neutral<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:48.059> then<00:00:48.300> uh

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
anything makes it neutral and then uh

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.869 
anything makes it neutral and then uh
when<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.530> give<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:49.920> reverse<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:50.960> will<00:00:51.960> break

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879 
when you give it reverse it will break

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:59.380 
when you give it reverse it will break
um<00:00:53.879> you<00:00:54.780> have<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.020> castle<00:00:55.530> Pro<00:00:56.190> BBC

00:00:59.380 --> 00:00:59.390 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.370 

that's<00:01:00.390> running<00:01:00.600> everything<00:01:00.900> right<00:01:01.110> now<00:01:01.230> it's

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:01.380 
that's running everything right now it's

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.710 
that's running everything right now it's
like<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.740> ESC<00:01:02.190> in<00:01:02.310> praxis<00:01:02.940> which<00:01:03.210> is<00:01:03.360> taken

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:03.720 
like the ESC in praxis which is taken

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.410 
like the ESC in praxis which is taken
forever<00:01:03.960> which<00:01:04.830> they<00:01:05.220> say<00:01:05.460> late<00:01:05.760> January<00:01:06.300> is

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
forever which they say late January is

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.690 
forever which they say late January is
the<00:01:06.630> due<00:01:06.780> date<00:01:06.990> for<00:01:07.920> whenever<00:01:08.340> they're

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
the due date for whenever they're

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.010 
the due date for whenever they're
supposed<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:08.910> be<00:01:09.000> getting<00:01:09.210> back<00:01:09.360> in<00:01:09.480> stock<00:01:09.690> and

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
I put VXL fans on there so the golden

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:31.220 
I put VXL fans on there so the golden
whole<00:01:24.450> system<00:01:29.390> got<00:01:30.390> twenty<00:01:30.660> seventy<00:01:30.960> five<00:01:31.080> to

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.440 
the metal gears up front I do have a
gyro<00:01:33.750> inside<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.640> receiver<00:01:35.640> case<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.240> will

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
gyro inside the receiver case I will

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.140 
gyro inside the receiver case I will
show<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:36.660> that<00:01:36.780> in<00:01:36.930> a<00:01:36.990> second<00:01:37.790> but<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.970> hot

show you that in a second but the hot
the<00:01:39.570> cold<00:01:39.840> side<00:01:40.110> of<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.410> system<00:01:40.800> is<00:01:40.890> going<00:01:40.979> to

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
the cold side of the system is going to

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.430 
the cold side of the system is going to
be<00:01:41.280> on<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.640> right<00:01:41.960> runs<00:01:42.960> all<00:01:43.080> the<00:01:43.110> way<00:01:43.229> back

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.440 
be on the right runs all the way back

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.990 
be on the right runs all the way back
it's<00:01:43.740> going<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:43.920> go<00:01:44.010> through<00:01:44.220> this<00:01:44.369> motor
