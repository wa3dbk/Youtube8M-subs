this<00:00:12.509> is<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.690> science<00:00:13.049> of<00:00:13.139> study<00:00:13.410> you<00:00:13.590> were

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
this is the science of study you were

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.830 
this is the science of study you were
here<00:00:13.860> to<00:00:13.950> have<00:00:14.040> a<00:00:14.070> lot<00:00:14.309> of<00:00:14.340> fun

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:17.840 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.570 

Wow

professor of physics at Marquette
University<00:00:26.240> here<00:00:26.390> in<00:00:26.420> Milwaukee

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:32.420 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.720 

okay<00:00:33.680> hey<00:00:34.680> there<00:00:34.830> got<00:00:34.920> it<00:00:34.980> going<00:00:35.340> pretty<00:00:35.520> fast

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
okay hey there got it going pretty fast

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.600 
okay hey there got it going pretty fast
oh<00:00:36.180> my<00:00:36.930> prediction<00:00:37.350> is<00:00:37.440> very<00:00:37.739> slow<00:00:38.130> very<00:00:38.370> slow

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
oh my prediction is very slow very slow

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:47.210 
oh my prediction is very slow very slow
oh<00:00:39.120> you<00:00:39.270> gotta<00:00:39.660> out<00:00:46.129> friction<00:00:47.129> is<00:00:47.190> a

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:47.220 
oh you gotta out friction is a

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.400 
oh you gotta out friction is a
force<00:00:47.309> between<00:00:47.879> two<00:00:48.449> bodies<00:00:49.050> that<00:00:49.350> are

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
force between two bodies that are

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.320 
force between two bodies that are
sliding<00:00:49.769> against<00:00:50.040> each<00:00:50.160> other<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.640> it

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:51.330 
sliding against each other and it

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.689 
sliding against each other and it
depends<00:00:51.690> on<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.050> couple<00:00:52.290> of<00:00:52.620> things<00:00:52.699> first

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
depends on a couple of things first

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.009 
depends on a couple of things first
thing<00:00:53.910> depends<00:00:54.210> on<00:00:54.330> us<00:00:54.420> what's<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.750> force

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:55.019 
thing depends on us what's the force

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:58.729 
thing depends on us what's the force
between<00:00:55.760> you<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:56.970> the<00:00:57.059> slope<00:00:57.390> so<00:00:58.199> as<00:00:58.530> you're

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
between you and the slope so as you're

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.369 
between you and the slope so as you're
going<00:00:58.890> down<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.280> hill<00:00:59.480> they're<00:01:00.480> sitting<00:01:00.750> from

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
going down the hill they're sitting from

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.590 
going down the hill they're sitting from
standing<00:01:01.680> flat<00:01:01.979> the<00:01:02.640> force<00:01:02.909> that<00:01:03.000> I<00:01:03.360> pushed

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
standing flat the force that I pushed

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.910 
standing flat the force that I pushed
down<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.839> ground<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.260> sequel<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.589> my<00:01:04.680> weight

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
down the ground and sequel to my weight

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.250 
down the ground and sequel to my weight
and<00:01:05.220> if<00:01:05.790> you<00:01:05.909> go<00:01:06.000> on<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.240> slimmest<00:01:06.810> on<00:01:07.110> the

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
and if you go on the slimmest on the

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.800 
and if you go on the slimmest on the
hill<00:01:07.470> here<00:01:08.090> part<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.180> your<00:01:09.330> weight<00:01:09.510> is<00:01:09.780> not

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
hill here part of your weight is not

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.510 
hill here part of your weight is not
just<00:01:10.260> pushing<00:01:10.590> down<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:10.979> grand<00:01:11.190> orbits

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
just pushing down to the grand orbits

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.280 
just pushing down to the grand orbits
pulling<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:11.880> down<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.150> hill<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:13.020> so<00:01:13.170> the

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
pulling you down the hill and so the

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.100 
pulling you down the hill and so the
steeper<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.619> hill<00:01:14.420> the<00:01:15.420> less<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.810> force

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
steeper the hill the less the force

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.600 
steeper the hill the less the force
between<00:01:16.380> you<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:16.950> ground<00:01:17.190> which<00:01:17.400> means

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
between you and the ground which means

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.680 
between you and the ground which means
the<00:01:17.729> less<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.000> friction<00:01:18.360> is<00:01:18.420> going<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.600> be

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:18.690 
the less the friction is going to be

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:19.760 
the less the friction is going to be
because<00:01:18.869> you're<00:01:18.930> not<00:01:19.020> pushing<00:01:19.290> this<00:01:19.470> hard<00:01:19.530> on

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
because you're not pushing this hard on

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:27.080 
because you're not pushing this hard on
the<00:01:19.830> ground<00:01:20.040> anymore<00:01:25.549> what<00:01:26.549> do<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:26.700> think<00:01:26.909> boy

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
the ground anymore what do you think boy

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.510 
the ground anymore what do you think boy
Wallace<00:01:27.390> your<00:01:27.630> tummy<00:01:27.810> shut<00:01:28.110> up<00:01:28.290> my<00:01:28.860> coach<00:01:29.220> is

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
Wallace your tummy shut up my coach is

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.440 
Wallace your tummy shut up my coach is
not<00:01:29.760> smooth<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:31.640> exactly<00:01:32.640> right<00:01:33.030> code

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
not smooth it is exactly right code

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.720 
not smooth it is exactly right code
isn't<00:01:33.750> smooth<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.320> he<00:01:34.920> got<00:01:35.190> those<00:01:35.400> bumps

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:35.730 
isn't smooth and he got those bumps

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.380 
isn't smooth and he got those bumps
there<00:01:35.990> and<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.260> makes<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.340> harder<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.030> go<00:01:39.210> down

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
there and it makes it harder to go down

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.110 
there and it makes it harder to go down
also<00:01:39.930> this<00:01:40.710> is<00:01:40.920> just<00:01:41.130> where's<00:01:41.640> here<00:01:41.910> it's<00:01:42.030> all

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:42.120 
also this is just where's here it's all

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.490 
also this is just where's here it's all
nice<00:01:42.330> and<00:01:42.510> smooth<00:01:42.750> because<00:01:42.870> if<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.290> stay<00:01:43.470> on

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
nice and smooth because if you stay on

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.720 
nice and smooth because if you stay on
which<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.610> get<00:01:45.050> side

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:48.730 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.830 

and<00:01:49.730> of<00:01:49.910> course<00:01:49.940> they're<00:01:50.420> faster<00:01:50.780> than<00:01:50.870> I<00:01:51.020> am

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
and of course they're faster than I am

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.940 
and of course they're faster than I am
excuse<00:01:53.840> me<00:01:53.960> professor<00:01:54.200> I've<00:01:54.530> got<00:01:54.650> to<00:01:54.710> take<00:01:54.830> the

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
up video oh because you've got here

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.800 
up video oh because you've got here
you're<00:02:00.860> going<00:02:01.070> against<00:02:01.400> gravity<00:02:01.610> and<00:02:02.510> when

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
you're going against gravity and when

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:03.970 
you're going against gravity and when
you<00:02:02.870> go<00:02:02.990> up<00:02:03.110> the<00:02:03.230> hill<00:02:03.260> you<00:02:03.500> actually<00:02:03.770> have<00:02:03.860> to

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:03.980 
you go up the hill you actually have to

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.320 
you go up the hill you actually have to
do<00:02:04.100> work<00:02:04.130> against<00:02:04.670> grab<00:02:04.850> you<00:02:05.000> should<00:02:05.150> have<00:02:05.240> to

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
do work against grab you should have to

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.719 
do work against grab you should have to
pay<00:02:05.510> back<00:02:05.720> gravity<00:02:06.230> for<00:02:06.440> them<00:02:08.740> haha<00:02:09.740> no

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
pay back gravity for them haha no

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:21.790 
pay back gravity for them haha no
hopping<00:02:11.150> on<00:02:11.480> it<00:02:19.930> you're<00:02:20.930> digging<00:02:21.260> in<00:02:21.410> too<00:02:21.590> much

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
hopping on it you're digging in too much

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.449 
hopping on it you're digging in too much
I'm<00:02:22.490> too<00:02:22.550> heavy<00:02:22.910> for<00:02:23.209> this<00:02:23.830> you're<00:02:24.830> the<00:02:25.250> same

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
I'm too heavy for this you're the same

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.030 
I'm too heavy for this you're the same
force<00:02:25.850> these<00:02:26.840> little<00:02:27.170> now<00:02:27.320> is<00:02:27.500> put<00:02:27.680> over<00:02:27.709> more

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
force these little now is put over more

force these little now is put over more
hear<00:02:28.280> ya<00:02:28.480> so<00:02:29.480> the<00:02:29.750> pressure<00:02:30.020> spread<00:02:30.440> out<00:02:30.620> you

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
hear ya so the pressure spread out you

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.030 
hear ya so the pressure spread out you
say<00:02:31.550> every<00:02:31.700> inch<00:02:32.000> is<00:02:32.240> pushing<00:02:32.750> less<00:02:32.930> fear<00:02:33.830> all

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
say every inch is pushing less fear all

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.380 
say every inch is pushing less fear all
your<00:02:34.220> wages<00:02:34.400> and<00:02:34.580> you<00:02:34.670> put<00:02:34.880> on<00:02:34.970> your<00:02:35.090> small

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
your wages and you put on your small

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.020 
your wages and you put on your small
skits<00:02:35.900> in<00:02:36.230> the<00:02:36.320> problem<00:02:36.620> is<00:02:36.709> as<00:02:36.860> I<00:02:36.980> pull<00:02:37.820> right

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
skits in the problem is as I pull right

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.660 
skits in the problem is as I pull right
down<00:02:38.240> in<00:02:38.480> a<00:02:39.040> little<00:02:40.040> heavier<00:02:40.459> than<00:02:40.550> your

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
down in a little heavier than your

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.280 
down in a little heavier than your
average<00:02:40.820> kid<00:02:41.440> you<00:02:42.440> don't<00:02:42.560> give<00:02:42.650> us<00:02:42.770> a<00:02:42.830> shot<00:02:44.290> CD

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
average kid you don't give us a shot CD

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.830 
average kid you don't give us a shot CD
there<00:02:45.500> you<00:02:45.590> go<00:02:45.760> you<00:02:46.760> ready<00:02:48.280> well<00:02:49.390> easy<00:02:50.390> yeah<00:02:50.630> we

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
there you go you ready well easy yeah we

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.060 
there you go you ready well easy yeah we
get<00:02:51.130> some<00:02:52.130> digging<00:02:52.459> in<00:02:52.810> so<00:02:53.810> it's<00:02:54.739> like<00:02:54.890> walking

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
get some digging in so it's like walking

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.880 
get some digging in so it's like walking
on<00:02:55.280> your<00:02:55.400> tippy-toes<00:02:55.730> versus<00:02:56.269> on<00:02:56.360> your<00:02:56.510> foot

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
on your tippy-toes versus on your foot

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.740 
on your tippy-toes versus on your foot
so<00:02:57.890> if<00:02:57.980> you<00:02:58.040> walk<00:02:58.190> on<00:02:58.310> your<00:02:58.340> tippy<00:02:58.670> toes<00:02:58.750> you're

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
so if you walk on your tippy toes you're

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.960 
so if you walk on your tippy toes you're
going<00:02:59.870> to<00:02:59.930> dig<00:03:00.110> in<00:03:00.260> more<00:03:00.500> into<00:03:00.800> the<00:03:00.890> snow<00:03:01.130> if

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
going to dig in more into the snow if

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:09.309 
going to dig in more into the snow if
you<00:03:02.120> walk<00:03:02.209> flat-footed<00:03:03.700> here<00:03:04.700> we<00:03:04.820> go<00:03:05.410> go

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.080 

if<00:03:09.829> you<00:03:09.950> had<00:03:10.040> a<00:03:10.069> little<00:03:10.310> more<00:03:10.609> speed<00:03:10.909> you

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
if you had a little more speed you

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.550 
if you had a little more speed you
probably<00:03:11.450> make<00:03:11.659> it<00:03:11.689> all<00:03:11.959> the<00:03:11.989> way<00:03:12.140> through<00:03:12.530> but

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
probably make it all the way through but

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.039 
probably make it all the way through but
that's<00:03:13.069> it's<00:03:13.370> it's<00:03:13.639> still<00:03:13.879> okay<00:03:14.180> it's<00:03:14.749> a<00:03:14.840> fun

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
that's it's it's still okay it's a fun

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:17.170 
that's it's it's still okay it's a fun
little<00:03:15.139> jump<00:03:15.469> there<00:03:15.680> so<00:03:16.459> you<00:03:16.549> take<00:03:16.730> your<00:03:16.879> speed

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
little jump there so you take your speed

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.539 
little jump there so you take your speed
u<00:03:17.930> divided<00:03:18.290> by<00:03:18.379> the<00:03:18.439> radius<00:03:18.650> of<00:03:18.920> the<00:03:19.010> turn<00:03:19.249> and

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:19.549 
u divided by the radius of the turn and

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:22.030 
u divided by the radius of the turn and
so<00:03:20.030> if<00:03:20.090> you<00:03:20.180> make<00:03:20.329> a<00:03:20.359> very<00:03:20.510> sharp<00:03:20.870> turn<00:03:21.230> in<00:03:21.829> this

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
so if you make a very sharp turn in this

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.030 
so if you make a very sharp turn in this
case<00:03:22.280> a<00:03:22.310> very<00:03:22.639> quick<00:03:22.909> going<00:03:23.719> down<00:03:24.019> back<00:03:24.290> up<00:03:24.319> you

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
case a very quick going down back up you

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.860 
case a very quick going down back up you
get<00:03:25.159> a<00:03:25.189> greater<00:03:25.400> force<00:03:25.760> if<00:03:26.359> it's<00:03:26.569> a<00:03:26.659> very

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
get a greater force if it's a very

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.809 
get a greater force if it's a very
shallow<00:03:27.170> kind<00:03:27.590> of<00:03:27.680> thing<00:03:27.920> like<00:03:27.950> over<00:03:28.310> here<00:03:28.549> you

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819 
shallow kind of thing like over here you

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:30.459 
shallow kind of thing like over here you
don't<00:03:28.909> feel<00:03:29.150> as<00:03:29.450> much<00:03:29.629> of<00:03:29.750> a<00:03:29.930> bump<00:03:30.139> you<00:03:30.319> might

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:30.469 
don't feel as much of a bump you might

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:31.869 
don't feel as much of a bump you might
get<00:03:30.590> a<00:03:30.620> bit<00:03:30.769> of<00:03:30.889> air<00:03:31.099> right<00:03:31.310> in<00:03:31.430> here<00:03:31.639> but<00:03:31.790> not

00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:31.879 
get a bit of air right in here but not

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:34.300 
get a bit of air right in here but not
much<00:03:32.090> but<00:03:32.329> here<00:03:32.659> the<00:03:33.319> curvature<00:03:33.769> is<00:03:33.829> much<00:03:34.129> more

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
much but here the curvature is much more

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.819 
much but here the curvature is much more
quick<00:03:34.579> changes<00:03:35.329> much<00:03:35.480> more<00:03:35.659> rapidly<00:03:36.019> you<00:03:36.709> get

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829 
quick changes much more rapidly you get

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:39.309 
quick changes much more rapidly you get
a<00:03:36.859> much<00:03:37.040> greater<00:03:37.250> push<00:03:37.669> up<00:03:37.849> in<00:03:38.030> the<00:03:38.209> air<00:03:38.329> so

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
a much greater push up in the air so

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:40.780 
a much greater push up in the air so
that's<00:03:39.530> why<00:03:39.769> when<00:03:40.189> you<00:03:40.280> get<00:03:40.430> the<00:03:40.519> ski<00:03:40.760> jump

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
that's why when you get the ski jump

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.059 
that's why when you get the ski jump
people<00:03:41.299> and<00:03:41.540> the<00:03:42.049> folks<00:03:42.290> on<00:03:42.409> the<00:03:42.500> snowboard<00:03:42.919> to

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.069 
people and the folks on the snowboard to

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:45.459 
people and the folks on the snowboard to
do<00:03:43.159> all<00:03:43.310> the<00:03:43.459> stuff<00:03:43.700> at<00:03:43.849> the<00:03:43.879> X<00:03:44.060> Games<00:03:44.319> you<00:03:45.319> have

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:45.469 
do all the stuff at the X Games you have

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:47.800 
do all the stuff at the X Games you have
all<00:03:45.620> these<00:03:45.739> big<00:03:46.010> big<00:03:46.669> hills<00:03:46.939> that<00:03:47.239> come<00:03:47.659> out<00:03:47.780> of

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
all these big big hills that come out of

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.780 
all these big big hills that come out of
