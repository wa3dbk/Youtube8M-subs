00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 hello everyone with you ning and today I will give you 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.069
 tell you how to open the world for 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.269
 network but the difference from the first video by 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.610
 this lesson 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.549
 I will also tell some details 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.830
 which I learned after that moment 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.640
 as i recorded this video and also 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:23.100
 I will try to show and tell 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:27.090
 solution of the most common 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:31.980
 problems and so let's start actually 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:36.420
 let's go into the world do not pay 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.969
 attention to the panel here as well 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.110
 a button to open the world to the web and nothing 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:45.090
 she's actually no different first 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:48.930
 so well there are standard settings here 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:52.320
 we open the world of ip by the way here about 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.210
 I wonder about the villages and some beer 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.520
 can be carried on by some 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.460
 there may be the same numbers as mine 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:05.580
 maybe a little bit of hands but that is not the point 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:08.159
 here these here is your local ip 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.780
 network meaning it doesn't need it personally 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.570
 no book draws him 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:16.770
 we only need the port we are interested in 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:19.080
 only so that your friend could 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.869
 join your world and play 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:25.740
 with you then download such a wonderful 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.900
 a program that is called hamachi here 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.840
 By the way, no matter who opens 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:34.500
 the network that is who creates the network is 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:39.200
 absolutely not important that is I checked and 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.200
 I have some kind of oddity 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:45.510
 so if you created a network then your 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.090
 a friend can open to the network everything will be 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.580
 work about it don't bother 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.900
 there are also internal hamachi 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.140
 problems as you can see i have 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:58.050
 several networks are open until but they are not 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:03.710
 available that is either include them somehow 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:07.460
 it is necessary either to update well at all 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.869
 actually did not understand this and if 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:13.890
 for a long time someone does not go into this 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.820
 network though in my two days if 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.330
 someone does not enter 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:23.850
 or day the network becomes so gray 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:26.220
 and include it here because I do not know when you 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:29.010
 create a network create a new network 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:32.970
 network id this is login 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:36.810
 password actually tell your friend 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.040
 this login with password it connects here 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.940
 for example i have here 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:44.110
 connected here let's take up 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.560
 any 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:50.650
 for example, this person should 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.590
 Imagine that I want to go in the world of the network 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.480
 here to this man I take and copy 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:59.080
 his address and a beer and 4 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.890
 so let me open another window 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.890
 minecraft 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.610
 as this is a little oddity 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:15.190
 happened 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:21.460
 in general, no matter okay, I will get out of it 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:25.120
 of the world and so when we copied ip 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:27.610
 Photo ipv4 address of the player he does not 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:31.660
 must go out of the world we insert it 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:35.830
 ip address then put a colon 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:37.090
 and write write port which will tell us 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.730
 they will tell us 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:43.900
 we enter it and everything works 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:45.910
 wonderful and so by the way 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:50.940
 saying I will tell you right away that this way 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:53.980
 Works on all versions from 13 to 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:57.160
 132 thousand starting wait when this one appeared 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:00.310
 button opening miles to the network some 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:06.459
 there were problems just did not open 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:08.110
 the world that is, a friend could not go the same way 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:10.239
 could be due to 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:13.420
 hamachi that is, the network could be 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:15.550
 unavailable perry connect if not 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:20.410
 help create a new network and will have 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:22.630
 you still work if the same if the same in your 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.520
 hamachi everything works fine and no 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.910
 no problem most likely problem 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:30.550
 in your minecraft it is desirable that is 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.169
 works with mods with anyone and most importantly 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.470
 so that the assembly you had the same 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:35.620
 there is 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:38.410
 perekin if you discovered bear measures 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:41.080
 for your other network fails 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:43.650
 come in then take your maykravt 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:47.050
 flip him on skype or else where 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:49.390
 somewhere somewhere so he downloaded and 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:52.400
 set myself the same version the same 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:56.270
 most fashion and then only will work 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.620
 By the way fashion like I do not remember 

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.100
 now the name of the trees 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:03.470
 Now in my opinion as he is so called 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:06.650
 In general, such modes as timber that are not 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.600
 require grumbling and obso download that is with 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.930
 they open normally one 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:13.430
 the player who has a temper will be 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:15.530
 chopping trees is normal and another 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:18.650
 will not be that is, this mod does not 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:21.710
 affects opening version 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:24.229
 and all fashion components the rest should 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.729
 be all the same that is if you have 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:29.479
 something different 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:30.169
 you can not go well on this probably 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:32.740
 everything 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:35.600
 yes by the way someone has some in there 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:38.479
 there was just a dark screen immediately say 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:41.360
 that a dark screen arises when 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:44.960
 you a huge number of mods worth it and 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:47.110
 or not no either a lot of mods and you 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:52.490
 your computer is simply not running 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:54.050
 minecraft dark screen or either mod 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:55.810
 set wrong then we crab 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:59.120
 will crumble 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:04.389
 Well, actually that's all if you helped 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:07.460
 that way i'm sure he helped too 

00:06:04.389 --> 00:06:12.169
 subscribe put likes comment 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:14.990
 if something is not clear if there are any 

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:18.979
 then some additions can I something 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:22.190
 missed also watch the first video 

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:24.050
 there I tell you how to open the world to 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:27.490
 network if you do not have internet 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:31.729
 connection meaning your friend is in 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:34.699
