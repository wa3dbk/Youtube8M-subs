00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.130
 Horror movie 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.490
 and that is that the film nothing left 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:21.119
 to fell the gateway to hell and this 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:24.060
 film is absolutely brand new that is 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.980
 yesterday so only on friday the 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.519
 thirteenth how could it be more appropriate 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:33.210
 father 13 came into the case and 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.950
 I took it out with me 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.250
 the video library and in me too yesterday 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.790
 even looked at evening and yes here would like 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.910
 I'll give you my opinion 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:47.640
 communicate what is his new 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.570
 draws ask to come into the community 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.699
 the pastor the brentford with his wife 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.699
 Wendy and her three children in the 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.190
 small towns alone is kansas 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.260
 the place is apparently peaceful its 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.239
 Residents are extremely friendly and 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.189
 Helpful at home to go her new 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.439
 The house is inviting and 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.689
 comfortable turns out soon but will 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.090
 the older daughter rebecca of dark 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.570
 premonitions and terrible nightmares 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.729
 pained 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.030
 She feels so attractive to take 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.580
 how mysterious only those involved 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.590
 More about a gloomy can know it 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.170
 shining and hovering over the place 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.330
 Her younger sister Mary is from 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.750
 possessed of a demon and goes to her 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:35.729
 own family going on 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:37.740
 as far as the content and yes the film sets 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.970
 the focus as you might 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.770
 can not beat on splatter and that 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.780
 eviscerate from any bodies 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:49.070
 but tries more 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:53.460
 yes in classic scares 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:55.140
 which I very much welcome so yes I like in 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:01.190
 Lately these more short movies 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.190
 it with there and told story and 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:08.399
 that means it and atmosphere try 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.679
 with classic scary effects that will find 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.470
 I always very good when it is 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:18.360
 because well done and yes the inclined 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:20.610
 Of course, fan knows this scenario 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:24.030
 certainly from some other films 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.640
 if an unsuspecting family in one 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:30.600
 sworn village community is coming 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:33.900
 and yes all this secret know and 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:37.580
 only you yourself relatively naive in there 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:40.500
 The village wander around and then it dusts 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:43.590
 announce events something like this is it 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:47.010
 Of course, there are also here 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:50.160
 some characters in the already at 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.200
 first appear somehow suspects that 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:56.030
 the real thing was not like that 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:58.320
 are friendly as they give and 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.290
 it's pretty clear that soon 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:05.040
 There is a secret in this city 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:08.900
 lurking whereupon the film is heading 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:12.239
 a pity I found that in principle the 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:16.769
 the whole population in the whole population 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:18.200
 Village actually completely outside 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:22.380
 calmly 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:27.959
 yes, this secret is really only 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:31.859
 worn by two people throughout the movie 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:35.040
 and transported and that 's a little bit 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:38.050
 too bad because usually it is with 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.700
 Filming of this kind so that 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:44.980
 first of all this village community 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:48.260
 quite friendly to the newcomers 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:50.590
 gives and behind closed doors becomes 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:54.940
 because already some mysterious 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:58.220
 things whispered and with hints 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.050
 played and yes and so will be 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.110
 usually build an atmosphere 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:06.580
 and you remain the real one 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.580
 Village population completely sterile and 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:12.200
 So does not seem to be in the in the 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:16.610
 be privy to at least secret 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:19.190
 until the end but there would be more in it 

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:23.030
 So there you would have been through a few 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:25.490
 Simple dialogs just look even more 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:31.720
 can get out of the tension yes 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:35.900
 otherwise the film works just then 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.000
 with year with a firework a cgi 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.590
 effects 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.030
 there he is really stuffed right 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.620
 also relies on my opinion 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.090
 bit in my opinion one 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.400
 a little too much on those effects 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.500
 are usually pretty good 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.630
 nothing outstanding it quite nice 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:54.470
 view and also provides the necessary 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:56.480
 google maybe a bit so much 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:02.660
 could have been more subtle 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:05.150
 yes, and finally, the second 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:08.470
 half if the gray then so to speak 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:10.640
 Go on a little bizarre and report 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.940
 is limited by a visible 

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:17.480
 threat 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:18.950
 yes that's nice, I would say there 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:23.540
 if you had but one can stallion more 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:25.900
 The picture then just in a glass table 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:28.640
 you could say evil final 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:31.040
 Overall, I would say nothing 

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:34.550
 left to fear certainly 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:37.670
 worth a look you will be determined 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:40.690
 not annoying but it is 

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:46.520
 Not a big deal 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:50.330
 and I would make the movie so five of 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:52.550
 Ten possible points give a small one 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:54.950
 I would like to say something special 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:57.020
 when I read a bit about it 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:06:02.990
 I want to push it 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:06.410
 this is this in kansas 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:10.550
 actually there and that's it 

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:12.260
 a kind of folklore legend 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:14.630
 is that this city â€‹â€‹is actually on the 

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:17.600
 gate of the hall was built and that there 

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:22.990
 regularly halloween what to do 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:26.360
 It is going on that people there are making a pilgrimage there 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:28.280
 scary scary the supposed 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.990
 cuddly atmosphere then to enjoy 

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:33.980
 because this town is supposedly real 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:34.430
 been built on the gate of the hall 

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:37.070
 should 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:40.670
 I found a very nice anecdotes 

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:46.060
 yes so far as my criticism to think 

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:49.940
 left to fear the gate to a yes then 

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:52.060
 what first and until the next video 

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.060
 then
