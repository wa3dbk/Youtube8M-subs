activity coupe with the x6 basis with
the<00:00:14.910> x5<00:00:15.450> but<00:00:16.049> it<00:00:16.139> has<00:00:16.260> sneaked<00:00:16.590> roofline<00:00:17.160> like

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
the x5 but it has sneaked roofline like

the x5 but it has sneaked roofline like
just<00:00:17.880> like<00:00:17.970> this<00:00:18.150> car<00:00:18.390> has<00:00:18.600> and<00:00:20.449> we<00:00:21.449> had<00:00:21.600> so

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
just like this car has and we had so

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.960 
just like this car has and we had so
much<00:00:21.869> success<00:00:22.439> with<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.920> f6<00:00:23.340> that<00:00:23.550> we<00:00:23.640> thought

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
much success with the f6 that we thought

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.060 
much success with the f6 that we thought
it<00:00:24.420> would<00:00:24.960> make<00:00:25.019> sense<00:00:25.230> all<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.590> sense<00:00:25.859> in<00:00:25.980> the
