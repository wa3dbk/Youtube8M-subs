00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
the length because they only vary in a

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.000 
the length because they only vary in a
few<00:02:30.820> minutes<00:02:31.090> but<00:02:31.720> number<00:02:32.050> one<00:02:32.260> and<00:02:32.440> two<00:02:32.500> or

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
few minutes but number one and two or

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.790 
few minutes but number one and two or
more<00:02:33.280> I<00:02:34.650> would<00:02:35.650> say<00:02:36.959> almost<00:02:37.959> in<00:02:38.440> a<00:02:38.500> baraka

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
more I would say almost in a baraka

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.000 
more I would say almost in a baraka
style<00:02:39.430> in<00:02:40.180> a<00:02:40.270> very<00:02:40.690> very<00:02:40.870> also<00:02:41.380> style<00:02:41.650> region

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
style in a very very also style region

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.820 
style in a very very also style region
and<00:02:42.340> they're<00:02:42.790> more<00:02:43.420> like<00:02:43.690> hiding<00:02:44.290> contrarious

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
and they're more like hiding contrarious

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.040 
and they're more like hiding contrarious
while<00:02:45.280> three<00:02:45.730> four<00:02:46.000> five<00:02:46.270> are<00:02:46.600> already

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
while three four five are already

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.830 
while three four five are already
showing<00:02:47.440> into<00:02:48.130> beethoven<00:02:48.730> into<00:02:49.240> that<00:02:49.420> kind<00:02:49.720> of

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.820 
showing into beethoven into that kind of
area<00:02:50.290> so<00:02:50.590> you<00:02:51.070> can<00:02:51.100> see<00:02:51.250> some<00:02:51.670> kind<00:02:51.910> of

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
area so you can see some kind of

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.260 
area so you can see some kind of

the challenge is not to become boring I

the challenge is not to become boring I
mean<00:03:14.510> if<00:03:14.870> you<00:03:15.290> don't<00:03:15.410> doing<00:03:15.920> five<00:03:16.160> contractors

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
mean if you don't doing five contractors

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.880 
mean if you don't doing five contractors
of<00:03:16.819> the<00:03:16.910> same<00:03:17.090> composer<00:03:17.510> then<00:03:18.200> it<00:03:18.349> there's<00:03:18.800> a

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
of the same composer then it there's a

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.680 
of the same composer then it there's a
huge<00:03:19.280> danger<00:03:19.489> of<00:03:19.760> going<00:03:20.030> into<00:03:20.420> the<00:03:20.540> same

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
huge danger of going into the same

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.270 
huge danger of going into the same
routine<00:03:21.110> over<00:03:21.349> and<00:03:21.530> over<00:03:21.860> again<00:03:21.950> in<00:03:22.130> every

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
routine over and over again in every

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.280 
routine over and over again in every
country<00:03:22.580> there<00:03:22.790> especially<00:03:23.660> with<00:03:24.019> Mozart

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
country there especially with Mozart

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.780 
country there especially with Mozart
because<00:03:24.950> he<00:03:25.519> had<00:03:26.239> a<00:03:26.269> very<00:03:26.959> solid<00:03:27.890> composed

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
because he had a very solid composed

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.720 
because he had a very solid composed
composing<00:03:29.690> technique<00:03:30.290> so<00:03:30.920> actually<00:03:31.400> it<00:03:31.580> was

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
composing technique so actually it was

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.119 
composing technique so actually it was
you<00:03:32.030> can<00:03:32.180> always<00:03:32.330> immediately<00:03:33.260> after<00:03:33.739> one<00:03:33.890> bar

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:34.129 
you can always immediately after one bar

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:35.259 
you can always immediately after one bar
see<00:03:34.370> this<00:03:34.549> is<00:03:34.670> Mozart

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
see this is Mozart

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
know this is the first time that I'm

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.700 
know this is the first time that I'm
doing<00:04:32.750> it's<00:04:33.080> the<00:04:33.170> first<00:04:33.380> time<00:04:33.470> that<00:04:33.530> I'm

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
doing it's the first time that I'm

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.560 
doing it's the first time that I'm
playing<00:04:33.950> all<00:04:34.130> the<00:04:34.250> five<00:04:34.430> contrary<00:04:34.820> and<00:04:35.150> it's

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
playing all the five contrary and it's

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.140 
playing all the five contrary and it's
actually<00:04:36.140> usually<00:04:36.680> very<00:04:37.430> easy<00:04:37.520> for<00:04:38.000> me<00:04:38.120> to

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
actually usually very easy for me to

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.180 
actually usually very easy for me to
remember<00:04:38.510> music<00:04:39.050> but<00:04:39.290> all<00:04:39.650> the<00:04:39.980> five

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
remember music but all the five

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:41.860 
remember music but all the five
controllers<00:04:40.730> promoter<00:04:41.090> is<00:04:41.300> not<00:04:41.450> so<00:04:41.630> easy

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
controllers promoter is not so easy

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.540 
controllers promoter is not so easy
because<00:04:42.050> they<00:04:42.380> are<00:04:42.410> very<00:04:42.770> similar<00:04:43.130> and<00:04:43.400> one

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
because they are very similar and one

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.580 
because they are very similar and one
message<00:04:43.940> from<00:04:44.060> one<00:04:44.270> country<00:04:44.480> no<00:04:44.690> can<00:04:44.960> easily

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
message from one country no can easily

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.120 
message from one country no can easily
be<00:04:46.900> change<00:04:47.900> it's<00:04:48.200> as<00:04:48.320> a<00:04:48.350> passage<00:04:48.740> of<00:04:48.890> the<00:04:48.980> other

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
be change it's as a passage of the other

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.400 
be change it's as a passage of the other
criteria<00:04:49.400> but<00:04:50.240> so<00:04:50.450> far<00:04:50.660> it's<00:04:50.840> going<00:04:51.020> well<00:04:51.290> in

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
criteria but so far it's going well in

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.200 
criteria but so far it's going well in
the<00:04:51.500> rehearsal<00:04:51.950> so<00:04:52.130> we<00:04:52.490> hope<00:04:52.670> that<00:04:52.700> I<00:04:52.940> will

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
the rehearsal so we hope that I will

00:04:53.210 --> 00:05:01.860 
the rehearsal so we hope that I will
start<00:04:53.750> with<00:04:53.930> the<00:04:54.020> same<00:04:54.200> computers<00:04:54.650> I'm<00:04:54.800> ending

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.870
