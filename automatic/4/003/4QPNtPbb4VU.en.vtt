00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.030
 it is worse for the 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.040
 suffering is worse than killing 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:15.190
 The animals in animals, we introduce ourselves 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:17.650
 the situation before you buy now no 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:21.520
 Reh to christmas but they go to 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:23.349
 someone who bred wild there are big ones 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.900
 meadow and have the whole series on it 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:27.850
 they are looking for a deer, the deer will 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.369
 stunned and then he gets a leg 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.320
 amputated which is then afterwards we 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.210
 carefully sewed on again that is then 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.860
 a three-legged but that can in 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.000
 captivity as a threefold re 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:41.460
 survive and you eat the roe deer 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.780
 if they do that 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:48.820
 probably not they would each 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.559
 when they come back 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.450
 see this three-legged deer and it will 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:54.550
 He is infinitely sorry if they do the deer 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:01:00.570
 but they would have killed it again 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:05.110
 let's not forget that weird 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:07.509
 good but what is arguably puts the pointe 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.000
 lies in the fact that they do that the deer 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:14.110
 that still lives visible to them 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.090
 the accusation that the deer is dead 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.600
 this leaves your consciousness 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.070
 out and because we are in our consciousness 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.659
 Do not save the dead animal 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:27.310
 it is relatively easy for us to eat 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.680
 that means it's ours, so to speak 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:33.840
 repression art owed that to it 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.840
 no longer vegetarian but there 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.480
 We want to confront each other 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.330
 Imagine the situation 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:44.040
 land aliens on this planet 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.750
 these extraterrestrials are human 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.980
 as high as in the movie 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.860
 independence day 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.750
 they are much smarter they are us 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.600
 in everything people are proud of 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.250
 ability to morality to order in 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.660
 to put oneself in a relationship 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.300
 intelligence and the like more 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:02.729
 Reasonly superior to the country 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.950
 now on this planet and we catch 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.670
 now people around them too 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.350
 consume 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.850
 especially the children who like to taste 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.740
 especially good this especially delicate 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.450
 others are used for the effect of 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.080
 to test drugs and much 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.150
 others more 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.950
 how can people stand up to this 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.640
 Extraterrestrials defend which 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.740
 argumenten 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.930
 they would say we are capable of suffering 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.580
 we are intelligent we are sensitive 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.590
 the extraterrestrials would say that 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:27.120
 I am everything but we are much 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.890
 smarter and more sensitive than you 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.450
 then people would say yes but 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.459
 You see, I will be incredible 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.630
 hurt and then they say 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.670
 extraterrestrial year that too for 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.090
 not nice, but it tastes good 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.090
 just fine
