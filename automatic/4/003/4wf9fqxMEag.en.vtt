00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:06.150
 just as you continue directly in the program 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.740
 now someone comes she just belongs 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.090
 me I am very happy one to the 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.090
 Giant applause here is failed 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.970
 I have today with the organ 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:29.859
 I considered whether one for tonight 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.759
 guitar with the song play or whether I 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:31.930
 I just like me on one 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:34.379
 put wrecking ball and a bit 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.379
 macabre 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.350
 I decided for the guitar 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.250
 because he will not be wrong 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.680
 arouse expectations 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.800
 Do you think about it all with something 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.530
 Tool finally a tree and such 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.110
 That's right, it's not that silly and me 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.220
 think that there are wrong expectations 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.410
 gone because I think people have it anyway 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.260
 always too high expectations 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.600
 for example, people expect relationships 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.980
 just always too much in relation 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.489
 man constantly want the proofs of love 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.790
 Constantly flowers poems many want one 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.860
 talk 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:13.500
 i mean i would come out 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.119
 east westphalia yoga bielefeld statistically 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.119
 we need to be used actually 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.060
 i can be from westphalia i am quasi 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.460
 without words grew up 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:32.759
 of well what should that and just talk 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.320
 I think it has to be rich 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.690
 but in things relations are enough 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.670
 there are two people meeting fuller 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:42.420
 I passion my that you get yes 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.250
 with that you realize yes you realize that 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.640
 if you arrive then or the 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.729
 it has happened to me several times 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.399
 and that's why I have a song now 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.890
 brought a song about true love 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:02:04.140
 a song about real passion and 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:06.300
 Do not look in your eyes then 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.280
 I know for sure I'm the right one 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.650
 I would you only real woman you 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.720
 Thou shalt know I would do it all 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:14.460
 I would not just run, run 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.930
 and even a high heel I would 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.610
 the up and start again 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.730
 I would ever have stopped 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.930
 everything that bothers me, yes, me 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.060

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:35.660

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:35.660
 besides making out with eric whole 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:46.600
 we can but what we already 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.730
 do not look it in the eye for me 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.320
 Clearly everything is different with it now 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.020
 I used to be with you earlier 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.510
 never lie to or compromise the 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:03.450
 in the cafÃ©s and I secretly move around 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:08.730
 Hairdressing with the help of hairstyle 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:11.280
 that was okay that i went through 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:15.260
 Hence it is still doing the 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:17.980
 banker dead irony 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.980
 but who 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:29.580
 completely different situation now for example 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:36.170
 here 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:38.940

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.370
 you and me 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.770
 When I look you in the eye I 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.200
 irritation what strong for me so on you 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:48.510
 do you ask in that tone and do I have it 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.680
 not yet seen are the 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:55.070
 idea is always in front of my house advertising stands 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:04:01.290
 'best you have felt that 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:03.900
 something big that honestly told me 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:07.290
 my dog already a bit oppressed I mean 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:09.390
 works to idolize then who makes 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.709
 about falling asleep and everywhere 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:15.360
 with your mail and constantly at the 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:17.250
 I do not say nervously when I do 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.590
 You can reach my people 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.000
 be grateful if you continue like this 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.190
 are you an example 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.350
 I think you do not know what 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.930
 real love is probably you 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.670
 still catching average is and still 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.860
 to one of the truth not 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:34.410
 tolerates and immediately over 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:37.860
 little things upset or around 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:40.320
 is standing with a hairstyle actually 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.560
 you could have cats to eat 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.360
 as well as much before details should 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.130
 that means that he goes too far 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.520
 Why do we have to do that yet 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.740
 not noticed 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:53.169
 you are not all you are one poor 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.389
 and old and obviously still 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:57.879
 not even smart when other men 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:05:00.490
 I want exactly that woman 

00:04:57.879 --> 00:05:02.349
 I'm a rock-solid guy 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:08.020
 Female living does not provide 

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:10.599
 cuddly sweet and empathetic and 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.460
 very nice but obviously white 

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:14.949
 not what i heard 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:17.650

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:20.020
 disturbed it is probably better we do 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:21.759
 here and now circuit just once 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:26.440
 I could stand a last greeting 

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:29.110
 now it stays pushed right 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:32.069
 Do you lie about it storm and come there 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.069

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:41.650

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:41.650
 that's a different story 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:51.750
 I'll be all alone again soon 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:51.750
 to an unfavorable position 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.110
 platter 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:03.020
