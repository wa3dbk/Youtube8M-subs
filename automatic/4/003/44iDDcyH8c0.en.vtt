00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:07.609
 Good, and you're one more who has 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:10.309
 curiosity about the cars that 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:14.120
 they walk alone they do not believe 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:17.029
 a lot of this can change your mind 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:20.020
 know that they are coming and are 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:23.090
 getting closer and closer to us 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:25.220
 Volvo took advantage of the last 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.740
 automobile from são paulo to show the 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.320
 its autonomous steering technology 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.000
 named drive that same one where 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.620
 the car walks alone without any 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.750
 driver interference 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:39.339
 if you did not see enjoy it because we 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.339
 we show you now how it works 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:47.390
 It's okay that in the salon the car got 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.440
 standing at the booth without any 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.299
 Test drive 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.729
 but it is worth mentioning because it is the first 

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:55.070
 time that volvo brings to Brazil this 

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:57.949
 technology that has already been tested with 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:01.549
 success the model used that appeared 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:04.369
 in São Paulo is the s60 sedan that is part of 

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:07.820
 drive me an autonomous driving project 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:09.890
 volvo that predicts that by 2017 the 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.640
 least 100 customers will be using 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:16.280
 autonomous cars in real situations in the 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.120
 streets of gotemburgo city brand headquarters 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.120
 there in sweden 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.940
 equipped with special sensors 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:31.180
 the system is able to keep the car in the 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:33.190
 track and make the speed adaptation 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.430
 according to traffic in addition to 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.229
 interact with other vehicles around 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.630
 so the proposal is that the car 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:43.300
 really can walk absolutely 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.440
 alone without the direct participation of the 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.570
 driver 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.610
 so much so that to exemplify the new 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.740
 condition inside a car 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:53.140
 volvo shows that the driver can 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.929
 even read a book or even have coffee 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.619
 while making the chosen route in 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:58.619
 your car 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:09.560
 how do you highlight volvo the drive me project 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.950
 is considered the only one by the brand because 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.720
 involves all the pillars of the chain 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.269
 legislators transport authorities 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.970
 prefecture vehicle manufacturer and 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:22.819
 consumers to help in this 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.220
 autonomy to volvo is also based on the 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:30.340
 on-call service 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.340
 24 hours offered to branded customers
