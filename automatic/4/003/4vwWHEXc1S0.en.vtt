00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
I will do it slow motion here and to

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.250 
I will do it slow motion here and to
show<00:01:17.240> you<00:01:17.300> that<00:01:17.390> what<00:01:17.810> I<00:01:17.840> will<00:01:17.960> be<00:01:18.140> doing

essentially is this and underneath and

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:30.670 
essentially is this and underneath and
then<00:01:22.790> only<00:01:23.060> object<00:01:23.360> anymore<00:01:23.630> rapidly<00:01:24.110> so<00:01:29.680> now

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
then only object anymore rapidly so now

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.710 
then only object anymore rapidly so now
this<00:01:30.830> there<00:01:31.520> I<00:01:31.550> raise<00:01:31.880> my<00:01:32.060> arm<00:01:32.270> but<00:01:32.420> I<00:01:32.479> don't

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
have to if I follow the exact movement

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:52.910 
have to if I follow the exact movement
of<00:01:35.090> the<00:01:35.180> form<00:01:35.420> it<00:01:35.540> will<00:01:35.630> release<00:01:35.900> downward

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.310 

notice<00:01:53.610> here<00:01:53.729> even<00:01:54.120> at<00:01:54.270> this<00:01:54.420> he's<00:01:54.870> in<00:01:54.900> a<00:01:55.110> very

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
awkward position and possibly a lot

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:03.970 
awkward position and possibly a lot
could<00:01:57.510> occur

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:03.980 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:13.000 

on<00:02:04.980> the<00:02:05.130> left<00:02:05.370> side<00:02:05.490> here<00:02:06.350> first<00:02:07.350> slow<00:02:07.590> motion

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.290 

releasing<00:02:14.010> it<00:02:14.130> out<00:02:14.280> your<00:02:14.520> back<00:02:14.730> under<00:02:15.030> your

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
releasing it out your back under your

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:24.290 
releasing it out your back under your
back<00:02:15.540> under<00:02:15.810> your<00:02:16.050> feet<00:02:22.730> there<00:02:23.730> was<00:02:23.940> releasing

back under your feet there was releasing
it<00:02:24.540> downward<00:02:27.290> finally<00:02:28.290> we<00:02:28.410> can<00:02:28.590> have<00:02:28.830> the<00:02:29.160> 2

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
it downward finally we can have the 2

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.970 
it downward finally we can have the 2
hand<00:02:29.610> version

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
hand version

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:40.160 
hand version
slow<00:02:31.980> motion<00:02:32.340> first<00:02:32.580> this<00:02:33.180> is<00:02:33.240> here

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.119 

right<00:02:41.170> out<00:02:41.319> of<00:02:41.349> performed<00:02:43.170> so<00:02:44.170> here<00:02:44.349> hit<00:02:44.560> in<00:02:44.680> a

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:45.129 
right out of performed so here hit in a

00:02:45.129 --> 00:03:07.809 
right out of performed so here hit in a
medium-sized

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:07.819 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:11.270 

so<00:03:08.819> all<00:03:09.239> of<00:03:09.480> that<00:03:09.510> is<00:03:09.840> a<00:03:09.870> simple<00:03:10.560> application

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
so all of that is a simple application

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.010 
so all of that is a simple application
of

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.470 

the<00:03:14.500> spiral<00:03:14.860> energy<00:03:15.930> that<00:03:16.930> could<00:03:17.110> be<00:03:17.200> seen<00:03:17.470> in

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
the spiral energy that could be seen in

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.910 
the spiral energy that could be seen in
some<00:03:19.480> of<00:03:19.630> the<00:03:19.750> older<00:03:20.140> young<00:03:20.350> forms<00:03:20.800> that

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
some of the older young forms that

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.400 
some of the older young forms that
preciate
