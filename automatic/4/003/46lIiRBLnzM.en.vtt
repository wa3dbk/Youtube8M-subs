00:04:59.380 --> 00:04:59.390 
build a car that they can drive from

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.300 
build a car that they can drive from
California<00:04:59.990> to<00:05:00.020> Florida<00:05:00.250> participating<00:05:01.250> in

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
California to Florida participating in

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.220 
California to Florida participating in
autocross<00:05:01.670> or<00:05:01.970> a<00:05:02.030> drag<00:05:02.300> strip<00:05:02.510> of<00:05:02.720> it<00:05:02.870> and

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:03.230 
autocross or a drag strip of it and

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:05.310 
autocross or a drag strip of it and
drive<00:05:04.130> it<00:05:04.160> back<00:05:04.310> you<00:05:04.820> know<00:05:04.910> along

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320 
drive it back you know along

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.840 
drive it back you know along
like<00:05:05.590> the<00:05:05.770> kids<00:05:05.980> are<00:05:06.130> cooler<00:05:06.460> in<00:05:06.550> the<00:05:06.610> truck

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850 
like the kids are cooler in the truck

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:09.060 
like the kids are cooler in the truck
and<00:05:07.360> it<00:05:07.540> feel<00:05:07.750> good<00:05:07.960> the<00:05:08.110> hallway<00:05:08.470> it<00:05:08.860> feel

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070 
and it feel good the hallway it feel

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:10.440 
and it feel good the hallway it feel
good<00:05:09.250> the<00:05:09.370> whole<00:05:09.520> way<00:05:09.700> plus<00:05:10.030> when<00:05:10.210> you<00:05:10.300> get

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.450 
good the whole way plus when you get

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:11.850 
good the whole way plus when you get
there<00:05:10.600> to<00:05:10.690> the<00:05:10.720> track<00:05:11.050> you<00:05:11.200> can<00:05:11.380> actually<00:05:11.680> tune

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
there to the track you can actually tune

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.640 
there to the track you can actually tune
the<00:05:12.010> suspension<00:05:12.520> tab<00:05:12.880> to<00:05:13.210> perform<00:05:13.630> so<00:05:14.500> that

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
the suspension tab to perform so that

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.710 
the suspension tab to perform so that
now<00:05:14.860> so<00:05:15.340> era<00:05:15.580> is<00:05:15.760> actually<00:05:16.150> getting<00:05:16.330> innocence

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
now so era is actually getting innocence

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.300 
now so era is actually getting innocence
attunity<00:05:17.140> performance<00:05:17.800> in<00:05:17.950> then<00:05:18.130> a<00:05:18.160> little

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
attunity performance in then a little

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.190 
attunity performance in then a little
bit<00:05:18.550> also<00:05:18.700> you<00:05:19.330> know<00:05:19.420> we've<00:05:19.630> actually<00:05:19.840> always

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:20.200 
bit also you know we've actually always

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.680 
bit also you know we've actually always
been<00:05:20.530> in<00:05:20.680> a<00:05:20.740> performance<00:05:21.130> end<00:05:21.520> of<00:05:21.640> it<00:05:21.760> a<00:05:22.060> lot<00:05:22.570> of

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
been in a performance end of it a lot of

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:23.970 
been in a performance end of it a lot of
guys<00:05:22.840> really<00:05:23.170> didn't<00:05:23.410> follow<00:05:23.590> us<00:05:23.830> in<00:05:23.920> the

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:23.980 
guys really didn't follow us in the

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:25.710 
guys really didn't follow us in the
beginning<00:05:24.070> because<00:05:24.490> they<00:05:25.000> thought<00:05:25.360> that<00:05:25.630> it

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 
beginning because they thought that it

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:26.880 
beginning because they thought that it
was<00:05:25.840> going<00:05:25.990> to<00:05:26.080> be<00:05:26.140> the<00:05:26.260> looks<00:05:26.440> of<00:05:26.560> just<00:05:26.740> making

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:26.890 
was going to be the looks of just making

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:29.040 
was going to be the looks of just making
it<00:05:27.070> go<00:05:27.160> up<00:05:27.310> and<00:05:27.400> down<00:05:27.520> exactly<00:05:28.420> really<00:05:29.020> i

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
it go up and down exactly really i

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.750 
it go up and down exactly really i
thought<00:05:29.440> making<00:05:29.920> the<00:05:30.130> finger<00:05:30.430> up<00:05:30.580> and<00:05:30.670> down

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:30.760 
thought making the finger up and down

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.000 
thought making the finger up and down
was<00:05:31.090> really<00:05:31.480> simply<00:05:31.810> a<00:05:31.870> byproduct<00:05:31.900> of<00:05:32.740> the

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.010 
was really simply a byproduct of the

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.070 
was really simply a byproduct of the
suspension<00:05:33.550> itself<00:05:33.880> when<00:05:34.390> our<00:05:34.720> first

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080 
suspension itself when our first

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.170 
suspension itself when our first
adventure<00:05:35.500> was<00:05:36.160> simply<00:05:36.460> to<00:05:36.550> make<00:05:36.700> the<00:05:36.820> vehicle

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.180 
adventure was simply to make the vehicle

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.090 
adventure was simply to make the vehicle
right<00:05:37.660> there<00:05:37.690> and<00:05:38.560> we<00:05:38.650> knew<00:05:38.770> that<00:05:38.800> air

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:39.100 
right there and we knew that air

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.320 
right there and we knew that air
suspension<00:05:39.460> was<00:05:39.640> going<00:05:39.790> to<00:05:39.850> make<00:05:39.970> a<00:05:40.000> ride

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330 
suspension was going to make a ride

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.540 
suspension was going to make a ride
better<00:05:40.620> who<00:05:41.620> as<00:05:41.740> we<00:05:41.800> do<00:05:42.040> was<00:05:42.190> going<00:05:42.370> to<00:05:42.430> make

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:42.550 
better who as we do was going to make

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:43.950 
better who as we do was going to make
them<00:05:42.670> handle<00:05:43.030> better<00:05:43.180> just<00:05:43.480> from<00:05:43.600> the<00:05:43.750> natural

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 
them handle better just from the natural

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.940 
them handle better just from the natural
carefirst<00:05:44.860> to<00:05:45.040> seminary

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:45.950 
carefirst to seminary

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:48.310 
carefirst to seminary
so<00:05:46.580> now<00:05:47.000> that<00:05:47.210> will<00:05:47.360> start<00:05:47.600> progressing<00:05:47.810> and

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:48.320 
so now that will start progressing and

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.670 
so now that will start progressing and
people<00:05:48.620> are<00:05:48.710> starting<00:05:49.010> to<00:05:49.040> build

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.650
