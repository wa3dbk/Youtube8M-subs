00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 sanogo is your michael yours again 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.620
 Biogarten resumed special today 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:10.440
 But let's make a sentimental one for it 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.509
 two sms red giant from france and 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.820
 print kings and normal medium sheep 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.820
 are something to add to me 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.010
 a bit of bread has a problem 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:36.780
 But really must be allowed to be very small 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:41.239
 a little half a teaspoon of garlic no 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.239
 krupp dynasty of course no topic 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:58.230
 then we have the case completely complete 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:09.930
 goes of course also in small fairy or 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:13.830
 As far as I'm concerned, I'm very involved 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.119
 good from everything marinated with mustard 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.100
 So be careful with us 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.100
 the green restore high temperatures 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.439
 I personally recommend anyway when 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.200
 prefer to grill at slower temperatures 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:29.610
 a little higher the trio almost hold for it 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.159
 slightly longer gave the same is a 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.829
 some delicate ones that are so unattractive 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.840
 The church is still painted on 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.509
 special tip on it nice first 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.899
 Reason enough is pleasant but the 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.670
 fresh is just marinated with that 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.240
 nice at least two hours best 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.579
 24 hours is synonymous two days is synonymous 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.439
 if so who meat from Reuters 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.130
 In the evening a special with that too 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.610
 absolutely okay 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.549
 best of course before grilling it 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.110
 down again and just before the 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:05.490
 last half-minute there again packs 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.860
 Yes, that 's what I've got to ask 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.140
 and question 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:13.180
 would the vcb question or 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.180
 following representatives and head of bio
