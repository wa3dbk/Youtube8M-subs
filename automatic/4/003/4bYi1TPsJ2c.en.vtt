cams but I'm going to unbolt everything

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.300 
cams but I'm going to unbolt everything
from<00:02:51.830> the<00:02:51.950> deck<00:02:52.660> and<00:02:53.660> I'm<00:02:53.960> going<00:02:54.200> to<00:02:54.320> clean<00:02:55.280> up

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
from the deck and I'm going to clean up

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.250 
from the deck and I'm going to clean up
the<00:02:55.700> top<00:02:55.940> side<00:02:56.240> and<00:02:56.420> I'm<00:02:56.510> going<00:02:56.660> to<00:02:56.720> spray<00:02:57.050> it

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
the top side and I'm going to spray it

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.180 
the top side and I'm going to spray it
also<00:02:57.700> because<00:02:58.700> it<00:02:58.850> all<00:02:59.030> looks<00:02:59.630> like<00:02:59.780> that<00:03:00.190> and

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
also because it all looks like that and

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.760 
also because it all looks like that and
I<00:03:01.340> want<00:03:01.580> it<00:03:01.670> to<00:03:01.790> look<00:03:01.910> like<00:03:01.970> that<00:03:02.650> without<00:03:03.650> the

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770 
I want it to look like that without the

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:10.060 
I want it to look like that without the
pity<00:03:04.750> so<00:03:05.750> yeah<00:03:06.310> anyway<00:03:08.290> here<00:03:09.290> since<00:03:09.770> it's<00:03:09.950> the

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
pity so yeah anyway here since it's the

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:11.550 
pity so yeah anyway here since it's the
bottom<00:03:10.370> of<00:03:10.490> the<00:03:10.580> deck<00:03:10.790> that<00:03:10.820> I'm<00:03:11.120> gonna<00:03:11.330> be

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
bottom of the deck that I'm gonna be

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.690 
bottom of the deck that I'm gonna be
stripping<00:03:12.560> it<00:03:12.770> down<00:03:12.800> and<00:03:13.130> repainting<00:03:13.610> it

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
stripping it down and repainting it

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.640 
stripping it down and repainting it
again<00:03:14.000> next<00:03:14.240> year<00:03:14.420> the<00:03:14.690> grass<00:03:14.930> will<00:03:15.170> strip<00:03:15.500> it

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
again next year the grass will strip it

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:16.510 
again next year the grass will strip it
down<00:03:15.800> a<00:03:15.830> little

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:16.520 
down a little

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.590 
down a little
I<00:03:16.900> just<00:03:18.250> sanded<00:03:19.250> it<00:03:19.430> a<00:03:19.670> little<00:03:19.880> bit<00:03:20.090> gossamer

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
I just sanded it a little bit gossamer

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.500 
I just sanded it a little bit gossamer
with<00:03:20.720> a<00:03:20.750> flaking<00:03:21.050> rust<00:03:21.440> off<00:03:21.709> and<00:03:21.950> painted<00:03:22.340> it

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
with a flaking rust off and painted it

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.449 
with a flaking rust off and painted it
but<00:03:23.510> this<00:03:23.660> top<00:03:23.959> part<00:03:24.290> I'm<00:03:24.920> going<00:03:25.040> to<00:03:25.130> get<00:03:25.310> my

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
but this top part I'm going to get my

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.340 
but this top part I'm going to get my
power<00:03:25.700> sander<00:03:26.300> and<00:03:26.420> send<00:03:26.720> it<00:03:26.870> down<00:03:26.989> to<00:03:27.050> bare

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
power sander and send it down to bare

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.580 
power sander and send it down to bare
metal<00:03:27.590> put<00:03:28.459> on<00:03:28.640> a<00:03:28.880> bunch<00:03:29.090> of<00:03:29.239> primer<00:03:29.540> and<00:03:30.350> a<00:03:30.410> bun

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
metal put on a bunch of primer and a bun

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.970 
metal put on a bunch of primer and a bun
campaign<00:03:31.660> and<00:03:32.660> hope<00:03:32.840> the<00:03:33.050> top<00:03:33.260> side<00:03:33.590> lasts

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
campaign and hope the top side lasts

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.620 
campaign and hope the top side lasts
longer<00:03:34.250> than<00:03:34.280> the<00:03:34.520> bottom<00:03:34.820> side<00:03:37.570> by<00:03:38.570> the

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
longer than the bottom side by the

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.270 
longer than the bottom side by the
reason<00:03:38.959> why<00:03:39.110> I<00:03:39.170> didn't<00:03:39.470> use<00:03:39.500> primer<00:03:40.010> on<00:03:40.190> the

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
reason why I didn't use primer on the

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.860 
reason why I didn't use primer on the
bottom<00:03:40.580> side<00:03:40.790> is<00:03:40.970> because<00:03:41.360> it<00:03:41.540> really

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
bottom side is because it really

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.400 
bottom side is because it really
wouldn't<00:03:42.140> do<00:03:42.320> any<00:03:42.470> good<00:03:42.560> and<00:03:43.239> I<00:03:44.239> really<00:03:45.170> don't

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
wouldn't do any good and I really don't

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.009 
wouldn't do any good and I really don't
like<00:03:45.590> primer<00:03:46.040> so<00:03:46.880> I<00:03:46.910> just<00:03:47.239> put<00:03:47.450> a<00:03:47.480> real<00:03:47.750> light

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
like primer so I just put a real light

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:51.180 
like primer so I just put a real light
coat<00:03:48.489> let<00:03:49.489> it<00:03:49.640> sit<00:03:49.850> for<00:03:49.880> 10<00:03:50.180> minutes<00:03:50.420> then

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
coat let it sit for 10 minutes then

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.820 
coat let it sit for 10 minutes then
completely<00:03:52.190> cover<00:03:52.430> it<00:03:52.780> the<00:03:53.780> real<00:03:54.230> light<00:03:54.500> coat

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
completely cover it the real light coat

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:58.810 
completely cover it the real light coat
that<00:03:55.610> chemicals<00:03:56.120> in<00:03:56.269> the<00:03:56.390> paint<00:03:56.709> dig<00:03:57.709> and<00:03:57.980> I'd

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.820 
that chemicals in the paint dig and I'd

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.960 
that chemicals in the paint dig and I'd
answer<00:03:59.120> a<00:03:59.330> question<00:03:59.810> but<00:03:59.840> the<00:04:00.790> chemicals<00:04:01.790> in

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
answer a question but the chemicals in

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.470 
answer a question but the chemicals in
the<00:04:02.000> paint<00:04:02.360> with<00:04:02.660> the<00:04:03.080> real<00:04:03.440> light<00:04:03.709> coat<00:04:04.480> you

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:05.480 
the paint with the real light coat you

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:08.080 
the paint with the real light coat you
just<00:04:05.750> let<00:04:06.200> the<00:04:06.380> real<00:04:06.530> light<00:04:06.739> coat<00:04:06.950> sit<00:04:07.310> for

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
just let the real light coat sit for

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.210 
just let the real light coat sit for
about<00:04:08.630> 20<00:04:09.080> minutes<00:04:09.260> that's<00:04:09.650> candy<00:04:10.070> corn<00:04:10.310> and

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
about 20 minutes that's candy corn and

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.650 
about 20 minutes that's candy corn and
chemicals<00:04:13.220> in<00:04:13.430> the<00:04:13.519> paint<00:04:13.790> and<00:04:14.060> you<00:04:14.120> eat<00:04:14.480> into

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
chemicals in the paint and you eat into

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.750 
chemicals in the paint and you eat into
the<00:04:14.900> metal<00:04:15.200> and<00:04:15.290> find<00:04:15.590> a<00:04:15.709> place<00:04:15.920> to<00:04:16.130> grab<00:04:16.340> on<00:04:16.580> to

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
the metal and find a place to grab on to

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.820 
the metal and find a place to grab on to
then<00:04:17.570> the<00:04:17.720> rest<00:04:17.930> of<00:04:18.109> the<00:04:18.200> paint<00:04:18.440> will<00:04:18.590> grab

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:18.830 
then the rest of the paint will grab

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:21.940 
then the rest of the paint will grab
onto<00:04:19.040> the<00:04:19.310> real<00:04:19.489> light<00:04:19.729> coat<00:04:20.000> and<00:04:20.680> that<00:04:21.680> works

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
onto the real light coat and that works

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.540 
onto the real light coat and that works
real<00:04:22.280> well<00:04:22.310> as<00:04:22.760> a<00:04:22.790> substitute<00:04:23.570> to<00:04:23.780> primer

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.030 

yeah<00:04:27.550> it's<00:04:27.760> looking<00:04:28.060> pretty<00:04:28.270> good<00:04:28.390> I'm

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
yeah it's looking pretty good I'm

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.160 
yeah it's looking pretty good I'm
probably<00:04:30.040> going<00:04:30.310> to<00:04:30.400> let<00:04:31.060> this<00:04:31.240> dry<00:04:31.300> for<00:04:32.050> about
