00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 welcome webber to my channel here 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.730
 we have the setup late the e3 in this 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.919
 I'm going to show you the size 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.050
 real storage and ram memory 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.550
 this phone in the last video of 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.410
 He soon made a mistake to what 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.480
 have to do with storage and 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.090
 that a micro sd had entered 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.160
 phone and that was showing me 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.810
 the memory that was not then to see 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.289
 the actual interior storage of that 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.260
 phone 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:29.290
 let's go be here by notifications 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:31.990
 configuration notifications and we're going to 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:33.370
 search here storage space here 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.320
 we can see really how much 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.870
 storage has that phone in the 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:41.020
 box tells us that you have I do not know if 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:43.420
 reach to see says abc memory the mass 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:48.220
 from the center and it will be very long 8 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.809
 gigabytes and mms + 1 gb of ram 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.580
 then we enter with space 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:53.410
 storage let's see that the 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.760
 phone has two spaces 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.470
 storage 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.739
 one is called storage the phone 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:03.030
 that gives me a 2 gigabytes available and 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:07.170
 if I go down and look 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.869
 what is storage is very rare that 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.560
 internal storage says everything arrives 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.780
 available here and then if low says 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.190
 again phone storage 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.310
 available 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.720
 another 3.72 gigabytes this means 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.119
 that has two spaces 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.250
 storage the first I imagine that 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.440
 is the storage available for 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.149
 applications that that total space of 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.470
 this storage that is here and 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:33.540
 then this other storage the 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.810
 phone is also available for 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:40.440
 other things is very strange but this 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:43.110
 would give 456 gigas available in the 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.750
 phone if someone understands well how 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.819
 this pod now I mentioned it then I'm going 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.640
 to return me to where it says 

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:53.220
 applications here in applications 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.530
 we can see really how much space 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.690
 We have available to download 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.250
 applications here we can see that they are 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.409
 two girls free parts for 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.330
 applications this means that the 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.300
 another four are for suddenly it's for 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.100
 have space for photos documents and 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.450
 other things but with applications 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.190
 they really are two 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.470
 if we go to the option that I made in 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.300
 execution we will be able to see how much 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.290
 ram we have here we see that 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:22.709
 we have 262 in use megabytes in use and 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:26.099
 703 megabytes free this confirms that 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.360
 this is a 1 gb ram phone for 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.250
 the user 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.500
 basically that was it for this video 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.630
 conclusion of the 8 gigabytes 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.360
 we have 6 gigabytes to the user of the 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:39.510
 which these six gigabytes two are for 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:42.900
 4 apps for other things and 1 gb 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.459
 of ram do not forget to subscribe to my channel 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.540
 her our questions comments or 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.540
 suggestions thanks
