 built-in microphone and it can send 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:55.960
 signals i.e. 3 pulls it 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:59.050
 the device and the computer sends a signal to 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.000
 doorbell while headset owners 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.920
 animal consists of a headphone or 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.140
 display but near future 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.039
 experts plan to use a couple 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.050

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.549
 artificial based system 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:53.530
 intelligence analyzes the signals produces 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:55.989
 human phrase scientists predict 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:59.349
 his market entry is already coming 5-10 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:02.010
 years until intelligence is detected 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:04.390
 animals are therefore most likely 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.120
 communication is at the level of reflexes and 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.859

 a certain team but in principle 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:33.310
 quite functional device 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.310
 somehow
