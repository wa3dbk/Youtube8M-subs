this battlefield 4 I'm not Call of Duty
i<00:00:17.260> play<00:00:17.890> battlefield<00:00:18.400> a<00:00:18.460> lot<00:00:18.670> when<00:00:18.849> it's

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:19.029

i play battlefield a lot when it's
actually<00:00:19.210> working<00:00:19.689> and<00:00:20.080> I<00:00:20.140> think<00:00:20.380> they<00:00:20.470> fixed

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:21.009 
actually working and I think they fixed

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:23.939 
actually working and I think they fixed
most<00:00:21.340> of<00:00:21.550> it<00:00:21.730> it<00:00:22.390> runs<00:00:22.660> really<00:00:22.929> smooth<00:00:23.410> now<00:00:23.619> and

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:23.949 
most of it it runs really smooth now and

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:25.589 
most of it it runs really smooth now and
never<00:00:24.189> really<00:00:24.490> crashes<00:00:24.910> on<00:00:25.029> me<00:00:25.179> anymore

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:25.599 
never really crashes on me anymore

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:29.009 
never really crashes on me anymore
so<00:00:26.470> props<00:00:27.039> to<00:00:27.189> dice<00:00:27.640> for<00:00:28.029> actually<00:00:28.480> going

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:29.019 
so props to dice for actually going

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:32.760 
so props to dice for actually going
ahead<00:00:29.259> and<00:00:29.650> fixing<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:31.300> big<00:00:31.660> issues<00:00:32.439> of<00:00:32.469> the

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:32.770 
ahead and fixing the big issues of the

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.470 
ahead and fixing the big issues of the
scheme<00:00:33.039> so<00:00:33.280> now<00:00:33.399> I<00:00:33.430> can<00:00:33.579> actually<00:00:33.730> play<00:00:34.120> more

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480

I'm almost a rank 50 I think it would be
a<00:00:37.030> lot<00:00:37.329> higher<00:00:37.600> rank<00:00:38.020> if<00:00:38.289> the<00:00:38.590> game<00:00:38.800> worked<00:00:39.129> and

I had more patience then because it kept

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.490 
I had more patience then because it kept
crashing<00:00:43.329> every<00:00:43.690> now<00:00:43.809> and<00:00:43.960> then<00:00:44.079> like<00:00:44.140> I

is a really good weapon and now a lot of

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.100 
is a really good weapon and now a lot of

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
people use it I'm not sure if it's

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.570 
people use it I'm not sure if it's
because<00:02:34.260> they<00:02:34.590> don't<00:02:34.710> have<00:02:34.830> it<00:02:35.190> because<00:02:35.370> most

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
because they don't have it because most

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.340 
because they don't have it because most
people<00:02:35.940> don't<00:02:36.060> use<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.570> assault<00:02:36.870> rifles<00:02:37.230> on

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:41.060 
people don't use the assault rifles on
this<00:02:37.470> game<00:02:37.710> but<00:02:38.960> the<00:02:39.960> Augie<00:02:40.200> is<00:02:40.500> really<00:02:40.920> good

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
this game but the Augie is really good

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.800 
this game but the Augie is really good
at<00:02:41.160> saw<00:02:41.310> a<00:02:41.340> rifle<00:02:41.700> I<00:02:41.760> preferred<00:02:42.180> over<00:02:42.360> the<00:02:42.630> ACE

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
at saw a rifle I preferred over the ACE

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.750 
at saw a rifle I preferred over the ACE
and<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.290> ACE<00:02:43.470> is<00:02:43.500> actually<00:02:44.100> really<00:02:44.370> up<00:02:44.580> there

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
and the ACE is actually really up there

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.690 
and the ACE is actually really up there
that's<00:02:44.940> like<00:02:45.120> my<00:02:45.240> second<00:02:45.570> favorite<00:02:45.690> but<00:02:46.700> this

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
that's like my second favorite but this

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.550 
that's like my second favorite but this
gun<00:02:48.000> is<00:02:48.210> really<00:02:48.660> good<00:02:48.870> it's<00:02:49.080> really<00:02:49.290> accurate

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
gun is really good it's really accurate

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.310 
gun is really good it's really accurate
it<00:02:50.340> has<00:02:50.550> the<00:02:50.820> same<00:02:51.060> damage<00:02:51.330> as<00:02:51.630> all<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:52.200> other

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
it has the same damage as all the other

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.780 
it has the same damage as all the other
assault<00:02:52.650> rifles<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:52.980> only<00:02:53.370> one<00:02:53.490> that<00:02:53.610> has

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
assault rifles the only one that has

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.750 
assault rifles the only one that has
better<00:02:54.420> damage<00:02:54.960> is<00:02:55.140> the<00:02:55.620> scar<00:02:55.980> but<00:02:56.280> the<00:02:56.460> scar

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
better damage is the scar but the scar

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.300 
better damage is the scar but the scar
is<00:02:56.880> really<00:02:57.270> inaccurate<00:02:57.960> and<00:02:58.110> not<00:02:58.310> really

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
is really inaccurate and not really

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.910 
is really inaccurate and not really
consistent<00:02:59.700> when<00:03:00.120> you're<00:03:00.450> taking<00:03:00.810> shots<00:03:01.020> so

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
consistent when you're taking shots so

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.340 
consistent when you're taking shots so
the<00:03:02.250> ID<00:03:02.430> stays<00:03:03.240> pretty<00:03:03.660> consistent<00:03:04.230> the

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
the ID stays pretty consistent the

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.950 
the ID stays pretty consistent the
entire<00:03:04.680> way<00:03:04.890> through<00:03:05.130> and<00:03:05.640> it's<00:03:06.540> just<00:03:06.810> a

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 
entire way through and it's just a

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.600 
entire way through and it's just a
really<00:03:07.500> accurate<00:03:07.680> gun<00:03:08.100> it's<00:03:08.280> like<00:03:08.370> a<00:03:08.400> laser

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
really accurate gun it's like a laser

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.820 
really accurate gun it's like a laser
beam<00:03:09.030> it's<00:03:09.270> pretty<00:03:09.540> good<00:03:09.750> it's<00:03:10.380> one<00:03:10.590> of<00:03:10.710> the

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
beam it's pretty good it's one of the

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.770 
beam it's pretty good it's one of the
best<00:03:11.100> assault<00:03:11.520> rifles<00:03:11.880> if<00:03:12.090> not<00:03:12.300> the<00:03:12.570> best

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
best assault rifles if not the best

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.720 
best assault rifles if not the best
that's<00:03:13.140> why<00:03:13.230> I<00:03:13.500> consider<00:03:13.860> the<00:03:14.250> best<00:03:14.400> because<00:03:14.640> I

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
that's why I consider the best because I

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.020 
that's why I consider the best because I
use<00:03:14.940> it<00:03:15.090> the<00:03:15.150> most<00:03:15.330> and<00:03:15.770> I<00:03:16.770> just<00:03:17.580> really<00:03:17.850> like

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
use it the most and I just really like

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.940 
use it the most and I just really like
this<00:03:18.180> gun<00:03:18.420> is<00:03:18.720> one<00:03:18.990> of<00:03:19.110> the<00:03:19.230> best<00:03:19.440> in<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:19.770> game

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
this gun is one of the best in the game

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.630 
this gun is one of the best in the game
and<00:03:20.209> I<00:03:21.209> actually<00:03:21.360> recommend<00:03:21.720> it<00:03:22.140> over<00:03:22.560> any<00:03:23.490> of

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
and I actually recommend it over any of

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.610 
and I actually recommend it over any of
the<00:03:23.760> other<00:03:23.910> ones<00:03:24.120> even<00:03:24.450> the<00:03:24.660> premium<00:03:25.140> guns<00:03:25.470> you

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
can get like the f2000 and I don't even

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.370 
can get like the f2000 and I don't even
know<00:03:29.790> the<00:03:29.970> other<00:03:30.120> ones<00:03:30.360> but<00:03:30.660> the<00:03:30.840> it's<00:03:31.140> better

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
than the f2000 in my opinion and the ace

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.750 
than the f2000 in my opinion and the ace
comes<00:03:34.230> really<00:03:34.500> close<00:03:34.770> to<00:03:35.040> it<00:03:35.160> everybody<00:03:35.490> says

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
comes really close to it everybody says

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.050 
comes really close to it everybody says
that's<00:03:36.270> the<00:03:36.540> best<00:03:36.720> but<00:03:37.320> you<00:03:38.220> think<00:03:38.430> dice<00:03:38.700> kind
