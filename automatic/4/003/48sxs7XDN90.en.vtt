a<00:02:52.990> touchdown<00:02:53.290> but<00:02:53.710> you<00:02:53.800> could<00:02:53.950> potentially<00:02:54.220> go

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
a touchdown but you could potentially go

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.910 
a touchdown but you could potentially go
for<00:02:54.790> an<00:02:54.880> eighth<00:02:55.090> point<00:02:55.420> either<00:02:56.020> by<00:02:56.320> running<00:02:56.590> or
