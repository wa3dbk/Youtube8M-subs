00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
mix brush it to your dough and you

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.460 
mix brush it to your dough and you
spread<00:03:22.910> that<00:03:22.970> around<00:03:23.210> with<00:03:23.450> your<00:03:23.570> hands<00:03:23.960> that

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
spread that around with your hands that

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:25.720 
spread that around with your hands that
looks<00:03:24.680> like<00:03:24.860> it's<00:03:25.070> not<00:03:25.220> gonna<00:03:25.340> come<00:03:25.580> together

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
looks like it's not gonna come together

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.470 
looks like it's not gonna come together
but<00:03:26.060> it<00:03:26.180> does<00:03:27.820> you<00:03:28.820> don't<00:03:28.850> have<00:03:29.120> to<00:03:29.210> go<00:03:29.330> all<00:03:29.420> the

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
but it does you don't have to go all the

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.850 
but it does you don't have to go all the
way<00:03:29.540> to<00:03:29.660> the<00:03:29.840> edge<00:03:29.960> but<00:03:30.440> I<00:03:30.500> always<00:03:30.620> use<00:03:30.710> my

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
way to the edge but I always use my

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.650 
way to the edge but I always use my
hands<00:03:31.190> because<00:03:31.370> I<00:03:31.610> can<00:03:31.790> make<00:03:31.940> it<00:03:32.120> nice<00:03:32.600> and

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
hands because I can make it nice and

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.780 
hands because I can make it nice and
smooth<00:03:33.110> that<00:03:33.320> way<00:03:33.500> and<00:03:33.950> I<00:03:34.070> can<00:03:34.250> feel<00:03:34.430> like<00:03:34.610> if

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
smooth that way and I can feel like if

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.750 
smooth that way and I can feel like if
there's<00:03:34.970> any<00:03:35.090> higher<00:03:35.390> any<00:03:35.720> low<00:03:35.870> spots<00:03:36.700> and<00:03:37.700> you

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
there's any higher any low spots and you

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.720 
there's any higher any low spots and you
just<00:03:37.880> kind<00:03:38.150> of<00:03:38.210> bring<00:03:38.330> it<00:03:38.540> around<00:03:39.640> until<00:03:40.640> it

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
just kind of bring it around until it

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.340 
just kind of bring it around until it
makes<00:03:40.880> a<00:03:41.000> circle<00:03:41.240> and<00:03:41.570> it<00:03:41.660> will<00:03:41.780> spread<00:03:42.020> out<00:03:42.170> of

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
makes a circle and it will spread out of

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.730 
makes a circle and it will spread out of
it<00:03:42.500> so<00:03:43.630> it'll<00:03:44.630> actually<00:03:44.870> puff<00:03:45.320> up<00:03:45.500> a<00:03:45.590> little

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:45.740 
it so it'll actually puff up a little

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:50.350 
it so it'll actually puff up a little
bit<00:03:45.920> because<00:03:46.070> of<00:03:46.310> the<00:03:46.370> baking<00:03:46.550> powder<00:03:49.360> all

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
bit because of the baking powder all

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.320 
bit because of the baking powder all
right

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
right

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.740

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
convection oven if you have one 400

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.520 
convection oven if you have one 400
degrees<00:04:06.800> regular<00:04:07.800> oven<00:04:07.950> probably<00:04:08.870> 400<00:04:09.870> to<00:04:09.990> 425

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
degrees regular oven probably 400 to 425

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:13.370

maybe 12 minutes to 15 minutes you have

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:14.900 
maybe 12 minutes to 15 minutes you have
to<00:04:13.560> judge<00:04:13.770> according<00:04:14.220> to<00:04:14.310> your<00:04:14.430> own<00:04:14.460> oven<00:04:14.760> but

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
to judge according to your own oven but

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.900 
to judge according to your own oven but
that's<00:04:15.120> what<00:04:15.240> my<00:04:15.390> did<00:04:15.600> 400<00:04:16.290> degrees<00:04:17.130> for<00:04:17.820> about

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
that's what my did 400 degrees for about

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.090 
that's what my did 400 degrees for about
10<00:04:18.269> minutes<00:04:18.570> and<00:04:19.170> it<00:04:19.320> made<00:04:19.440> a<00:04:19.470> beautiful<00:04:19.680> crust

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
10 minutes and it made a beautiful crust

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.039 
10 minutes and it made a beautiful crust
and<00:04:20.790> you<00:04:20.940> can<00:04:21.120> see<00:04:21.299> from<00:04:21.510> the<00:04:21.600> pizza<00:04:21.810> that<00:04:21.989> I

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
and you can see from the pizza that I

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:22.720 
and you can see from the pizza that I
made<00:04:22.230> earlier

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:22.730 
made earlier

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:27.560 
made earlier

don't bring that crust is and it just
comes<00:04:27.750> out<00:04:27.900> flat<00:04:28.230> on<00:04:28.260> the<00:04:28.500> sheet<00:04:28.710> you<00:04:28.860> don't

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
comes out flat on the sheet you don't

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:30.230 
comes out flat on the sheet you don't
have<00:04:29.160> to<00:04:29.250> turn<00:04:29.430> it<00:04:29.610> or<00:04:29.730> anything<00:04:29.910> it<00:04:30.210> just

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
have to turn it or anything it just

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.380 
have to turn it or anything it just
comes<00:04:30.600> out<00:04:30.750> just<00:04:31.290> like<00:04:31.410> that<00:04:31.710> and<00:04:32.460> it's<00:04:33.270> got

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.390 
comes out just like that and it's got

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.240 
comes out just like that and it's got
kind<00:04:33.810> of<00:04:33.840> a<00:04:33.960> crusty<00:04:34.470> edge<00:04:34.620> on<00:04:34.890> it<00:04:34.920> which<00:04:35.100> is

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
kind of a crusty edge on it which is

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.430 
kind of a crusty edge on it which is
nice<00:04:35.460> and<00:04:35.820> if<00:04:36.480> you<00:04:36.600> want<00:04:36.840> it<00:04:36.960> to<00:04:37.080> be<00:04:37.200> even

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
nice and if you want it to be even

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.220 
nice and if you want it to be even
crustier<00:04:38.070> you<00:04:38.610> can<00:04:38.790> actually<00:04:39.000> flip<00:04:39.540> this<00:04:39.870> over

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:40.230 
crustier you can actually flip this over

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.370 
crustier you can actually flip this over
and<00:04:40.620> on<00:04:41.010> your<00:04:41.280> pan<00:04:41.550> and<00:04:41.970> put<00:04:42.810> it<00:04:42.840> back<00:04:43.050> in<00:04:43.260> the

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
and on your pan and put it back in the

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.500 
and on your pan and put it back in the
oven<00:04:43.410> and<00:04:43.770> maybe<00:04:43.950> just<00:04:44.730> bake<00:04:44.910> it<00:04:45.090> for<00:04:45.240> a<00:04:45.300> few

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
oven and maybe just bake it for a few

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.960 
oven and maybe just bake it for a few
more<00:04:45.660> minutes<00:04:46.130> not<00:04:47.130> too<00:04:47.310> long<00:04:47.490> because<00:04:47.700> these

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
more minutes not too long because these

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.120 
more minutes not too long because these
eggs<00:04:48.240> will<00:04:48.330> turn<00:04:48.840> brown<00:04:49.080> on<00:04:49.320> you<00:04:49.440> but<00:04:49.920> it'll

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130 
eggs will turn brown on you but it'll
