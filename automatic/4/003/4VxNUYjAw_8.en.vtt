Carl Nelson from the imagination station
i<00:00:06.569> say<00:00:06.750> that<00:00:06.779> because<00:00:06.960> i'm<00:00:07.890> putting<00:00:08.130> these

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
i say that because i'm putting these

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:09.500 
i say that because i'm putting these
gloves<00:00:08.400> on<00:00:08.580> we<00:00:08.700> got<00:00:08.820> all<00:00:08.940> kinds<00:00:09.210> of<00:00:09.269> liquid

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
gloves on we got all kinds of liquid

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.240 
gloves on we got all kinds of liquid
nitrogen<00:00:09.809> smoke<00:00:10.200> billowing<00:00:10.500> exactly<00:00:11.160> we're

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
nitrogen smoke billowing exactly we're

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.680 
nitrogen smoke billowing exactly we're
gonna<00:00:11.340> combine<00:00:11.519> nitrogen<00:00:12.150> liquid<00:00:12.330> nitrogen

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
gonna combine nitrogen liquid nitrogen

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.539 
gonna combine nitrogen liquid nitrogen
with<00:00:12.929> some<00:00:13.019> electricity<00:00:13.349> light<00:00:14.009> bulbs<00:00:14.190> I

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
with some electricity light bulbs I

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.039 
with some electricity light bulbs I
brought<00:00:15.000> in<00:00:15.150> an<00:00:15.240> incandescent<00:00:15.540> light<00:00:15.870> bulb

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
brought in an incandescent light bulb

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.630 
brought in an incandescent light bulb
okay<00:00:16.590> these<00:00:17.039> are<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.190> kind<00:00:17.310> of<00:00:17.400> bulbs<00:00:17.580> that

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
okay these are the kind of bulbs that

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.590 
okay these are the kind of bulbs that
are<00:00:17.699> being<00:00:17.850> phased<00:00:18.060> up<00:00:18.270> because<00:00:18.480> they're

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
are being phased up because they're

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.450 
are being phased up because they're
really<00:00:19.140> inefficient<00:00:19.380> but<00:00:20.160> there's<00:00:20.369> some

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
really inefficient but there's some

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.650 
really inefficient but there's some
really<00:00:20.550> cool<00:00:20.730> engineering<00:00:21.240> that<00:00:21.330> goes<00:00:21.390> into

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
really cool engineering that goes into

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.509 
really cool engineering that goes into
making<00:00:21.750> these<00:00:22.080> things<00:00:22.289> work<00:00:22.560> in<00:00:22.800> fact<00:00:23.220> this

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
making these things work in fact this

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.400 
making these things work in fact this
200<00:00:23.939> watt<00:00:24.029> light<00:00:24.150> bulb<00:00:24.359> which<00:00:24.869> I'll<00:00:25.170> have<00:00:25.350> you

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
200 watt light bulb which I'll have you

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.870 
200 watt light bulb which I'll have you
hold<00:00:25.560> right<00:00:25.710> 200<00:00:26.220> watts<00:00:26.369> I<00:00:26.490> thought<00:00:26.699> it<00:00:26.789> was

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
hold right 200 watts I thought it was

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.490 
hold right 200 watts I thought it was
seen<00:00:27.119> one<00:00:27.240> like<00:00:27.359> that<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.869> filament<00:00:28.349> inside

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
seen one like that the filament inside

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.970 
seen one like that the filament inside
gets<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.609> about<00:00:29.699> 5,000<00:00:30.630> degrees<00:00:30.720> Fahrenheit

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:30.980 
gets to about 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.080 
gets to about 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit
well<00:00:31.980> she's<00:00:32.189> just<00:00:32.340> crazy<00:00:32.640> when<00:00:32.969> you<00:00:33.000> think

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
well she's just crazy when you think

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.940 
well she's just crazy when you think
about<00:00:33.239> it<00:00:33.420> at<00:00:33.930> 5,000<00:00:34.710> degrees<00:00:34.800> Fahrenheit

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
about it at 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.040 
about it at 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit
bulb<00:00:35.880> manufacturers<00:00:36.300> have<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.750> watch<00:00:36.899> out<00:00:37.020> for

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
bulb manufacturers have to watch out for

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.780 
bulb manufacturers have to watch out for
a<00:00:37.200> couple<00:00:37.320> things<00:00:37.559> one<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:38.040> metal<00:00:38.489> from<00:00:38.610> the

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
a couple things one the metal from the

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.340 
a couple things one the metal from the
filament<00:00:39.210> will<00:00:39.300> actually<00:00:39.540> evaporate<00:00:40.140> and

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
filament will actually evaporate and

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.810 
filament will actually evaporate and
leave<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.950> filament<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.520> other<00:00:41.640> thing<00:00:41.790> is

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
leave the filament the other thing is

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.910 
leave the filament the other thing is
any<00:00:42.090> oxygen<00:00:42.570> inside<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.079> bulb<00:00:43.260> will<00:00:43.649> cause<00:00:43.800> it

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
any oxygen inside the bulb will cause it

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.040 
any oxygen inside the bulb will cause it
to<00:00:43.950> oxidize<00:00:44.430> quickly<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.090> just<00:00:45.390> burn<00:00:45.539> out<00:00:45.719> all

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
to oxidize quickly and just burn out all

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.720 
to oxidize quickly and just burn out all
right<00:00:46.200> so<00:00:46.559> why<00:00:46.829> don't<00:00:46.980> we<00:00:47.010> try<00:00:47.219> that<00:00:47.250> okay<00:00:47.700> I

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
right so why don't we try that okay I

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.220 
right so why don't we try that okay I
see<00:00:47.940> what<00:00:48.059> that<00:00:48.120> looks<00:00:48.180> like<00:00:48.390> go<00:00:49.050> ahead<00:00:49.200> and

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
see what that looks like go ahead and

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.110 
see what that looks like go ahead and
stick<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.250> on<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.520> table<00:00:50.730> in<00:00:50.789> fact<00:00:50.940> i'll

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
stick that on the table in fact i'll

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.819 
stick that on the table in fact i'll
give<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.420> piece<00:00:51.570> of<00:00:51.600> paper<00:00:51.719> gotcha<00:00:52.379> go

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
give you the piece of paper gotcha go

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:53.930

ahead<00:00:52.949> and<00:00:53.039> stick<00:00:53.190> that<00:00:53.219> on<00:00:53.399> top<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.760> bulb

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
ahead and stick that on top of the bulb

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.729 
ahead and stick that on top of the bulb
and<00:00:54.120> i<00:00:54.239> gave<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.600> mallet<00:00:54.930> what<00:00:55.230> what<00:00:55.559> I

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
heat up whoa and it will then burn out

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.179 
heat up whoa and it will then burn out
because<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.420> oxygen<00:01:21.540> in<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.049> atmosphere

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
because the oxygen in the atmosphere

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:24.649 
because the oxygen in the atmosphere
just<00:01:23.189> makes<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.490> rapidly<00:01:23.820> oxidized<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.330> then

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
just makes it rapidly oxidized and then

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.140 
just makes it rapidly oxidized and then
it's<00:01:24.780> done<00:01:24.900> don't<00:01:25.290> touch<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:25.470> yeah<00:01:25.890> ok<00:01:26.430> so

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
it's done don't touch that yeah ok so

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.249 
it's done don't touch that yeah ok so
I'll<00:01:27.240> take<00:01:27.330> that<00:01:27.450> away<00:01:27.570> from<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:27.869> now<00:01:27.900> thank

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
I'll take that away from you now thank

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.660 
I'll take that away from you now thank
you<00:01:28.350> now<00:01:28.680> so<00:01:29.159> I<00:01:29.189> thought<00:01:29.490> you'd<00:01:29.640> be

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
you now so I thought you'd be

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.120 
you now so I thought you'd be
interesting<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.180> take<00:01:30.450> what<00:01:31.130> manufacturers

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
interesting to take what manufacturers

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.830 
interesting to take what manufacturers
normally<00:01:32.460> do<00:01:32.610> which<00:01:32.790> is<00:01:32.850> take<00:01:33.270> that<00:01:33.420> filament

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
normally do which is take that filament

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.899 
normally do which is take that filament
which<00:01:34.439> we<00:01:34.619> just<00:01:34.799> exposed<00:01:35.159> stick<00:01:35.640> inside

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
which we just exposed stick inside

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.060 
which we just exposed stick inside
another<00:01:36.240> housing<00:01:36.960> of<00:01:37.290> sorts<00:01:37.560> sure<00:01:37.799> filled

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
another housing of sorts sure filled

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.580 
another housing of sorts sure filled
with<00:01:38.310> nitrogen<00:01:38.520> gas<00:01:38.850> ok<00:01:39.750> as<00:01:39.810> nitrogen<00:01:40.140> has<00:01:40.409> no

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
with nitrogen gas ok as nitrogen has no

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.649 
with nitrogen gas ok as nitrogen has no
oxygen<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:41.130> should<00:01:41.310> allow<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.549> bulb<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:42.299> light

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
oxygen it should allow the bulb to light

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.870 
oxygen it should allow the bulb to light
up<00:01:43.170> reach<00:01:43.560> that<00:01:43.710> 5,000<00:01:44.280> degree<00:01:44.460> temperature

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
up reach that 5,000 degree temperature

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.260 
up reach that 5,000 degree temperature
even<00:01:45.810> though<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.079> night<00:01:46.229> liquid<00:01:46.530> nitrogen<00:01:46.829> is

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
even though the night liquid nitrogen is

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.679 
even though the night liquid nitrogen is
320<00:01:48.270> degrees<00:01:48.360> below<00:01:48.810> zero<00:01:49.290> ok<00:01:50.509> that's<00:01:51.509> a<00:01:51.570> lot

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
320 degrees below zero ok that's a lot

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.210 
320 degrees below zero ok that's a lot
of<00:01:51.720> stuff<00:01:51.960> there<00:01:52.140> right<00:01:52.290> so<00:01:52.470> in<00:01:52.590> my<00:01:52.740> mind<00:01:52.770> it's

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
of stuff there right so in my mind it's

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.490 
of stuff there right so in my mind it's
320<00:01:53.939> degrees<00:01:54.030> below<00:01:54.450> zero<00:01:54.869> we're<00:01:55.049> gonna<00:01:55.140> stick

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
320 degrees below zero we're gonna stick

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.260 
320 degrees below zero we're gonna stick
a<00:01:55.530> light<00:01:55.740> bulb<00:01:55.979> down<00:01:56.219> inside<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:57.000> liquid

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
a light bulb down inside the liquid

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.510 
a light bulb down inside the liquid
itself<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.170> see<00:01:58.680> if<00:01:58.740> they'll<00:01:58.860> actually<00:01:59.070> light

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
itself and see if they'll actually light

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.340 
itself and see if they'll actually light
up<00:01:59.549> man<00:02:00.060> I<00:02:00.090> think<00:02:00.540> all<00:02:00.810> right<00:02:00.930> a<00:02:00.960> light<00:02:01.170> bulb

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
up man I think all right a light bulb

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.319 
up man I think all right a light bulb
went<00:02:01.409> off<00:02:01.590> somewhere<00:02:01.860> over<00:02:02.340> Carl's<00:02:02.670> head<00:02:02.820> all

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
went off somewhere over Carl's head all

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.080 
went off somewhere over Carl's head all
right<00:02:03.450> this<00:02:03.570> experiment<00:02:04.170> i'll<00:02:04.380> let<00:02:04.680> you

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
right this experiment i'll let you

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.639 
right this experiment i'll let you
gently<00:02:06.090> hold<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.540> scene<00:02:06.750> here<00:02:06.899> for<00:02:07.079> sure<00:02:07.290> sure

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
gently hold the scene here for sure sure

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.559 
gently hold the scene here for sure sure
ok<00:02:08.009> just<00:02:08.190> don't<00:02:08.399> touch<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.729> liquid<00:02:09.300> though<00:02:09.420> no

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
ok just don't touch the liquid though no

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.210 
ok just don't touch the liquid though no
bring<00:02:09.780> it<00:02:09.869> down<00:02:09.989> Oh<00:02:10.140> all<00:02:10.470> undone<00:02:10.800> plunge<00:02:11.099> it

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
bring it down Oh all undone plunge it

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.120 
bring it down Oh all undone plunge it
right<00:02:11.459> into<00:02:11.640> the

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
right into the

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.340 
right into the
ok<00:02:12.460> they're<00:02:12.610> going<00:02:12.730> into<00:02:13.270> the<00:02:13.390> liquid<00:02:13.570> we're

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
ok they're going into the liquid we're

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:15.990 
ok they're going into the liquid we're
going<00:02:14.440> to<00:02:14.500> plug<00:02:14.950> it<00:02:15.100> in<00:02:15.220> a<00:02:15.430> little<00:02:15.730> bit<00:02:15.910> further

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
going to plug it in a little bit further

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.040 
going to plug it in a little bit further
ok<00:02:16.450> rest<00:02:16.780> it<00:02:16.930> in<00:02:17.050> there<00:02:17.200> ok<00:02:17.560> ok<00:02:17.890> turn<00:02:18.580> it<00:02:18.700> on<00:02:19.050> Wow

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
ok rest it in there ok ok turn it on Wow

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:22.410 
ok rest it in there ok ok turn it on Wow
see<00:02:20.590> all<00:02:20.800> the<00:02:21.070> extra<00:02:21.400> sub<00:02:21.580> paper<00:02:21.940> coming<00:02:22.300> off

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
see all the extra sub paper coming off

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.960 
see all the extra sub paper coming off
is<00:02:22.840> that<00:02:23.020> 5000<00:02:23.740> degree<00:02:23.980> filament<00:02:24.610> is<00:02:24.700> heating

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
is that 5000 degree filament is heating

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.190 
is that 5000 degree filament is heating
up<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.060> nitrogen<00:02:25.540> turning<00:02:25.750> it<00:02:25.810> into<00:02:25.900> a<00:02:25.990> gas

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
up the nitrogen turning it into a gas

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.890 
up the nitrogen turning it into a gas
and<00:02:26.440> it<00:02:27.130> continues<00:02:27.550> to<00:02:27.670> light<00:02:27.820> up<00:02:27.940> the<00:02:28.090> coolest

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
and it continues to light up the coolest

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.320 
and it continues to light up the coolest
thing<00:02:29.080> ever<00:02:29.260> it's<00:02:29.440> really<00:02:29.740> fun<00:02:30.090> inside<00:02:31.090> the

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
thing ever it's really fun inside the

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.660 
thing ever it's really fun inside the
liquid<00:02:31.540> right<00:02:32.200> yeah<00:02:32.500> now<00:02:33.040> of<00:02:33.190> course<00:02:33.250> i'll

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
liquid right yeah now of course i'll

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.340 
liquid right yeah now of course i'll
give<00:02:34.120> you<00:02:34.210> the<00:02:34.330> honor<00:02:34.480> of<00:02:34.660> slowly<00:02:35.050> pulling

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
give you the honor of slowly pulling

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.960 
give you the honor of slowly pulling
that<00:02:35.530> out<00:02:35.590> right<00:02:36.010> and<00:02:36.220> now<00:02:36.370> when<00:02:36.550> I<00:02:36.580> pull<00:02:36.850> it

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
that out right and now when I pull it

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.670 
that out right and now when I pull it
out<00:02:37.060> is<00:02:37.270> it<00:02:37.300> going<00:02:37.690> to<00:02:37.810> once<00:02:38.050> again<00:02:38.170> dissipate

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
out is it going to once again dissipate

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.900 
out is it going to once again dissipate
just<00:02:38.920> like<00:02:39.040> we<00:02:39.130> saw<00:02:39.280> the<00:02:39.340> other<00:02:39.430> one<00:02:39.700> well

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
just like we saw the other one well

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.520 
just like we saw the other one well
remember<00:02:40.360> it<00:02:40.420> liquid<00:02:40.840> nitrogen<00:02:41.080> down<00:02:41.260> here<00:02:41.470> we

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
remember it liquid nitrogen down here we

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.100 
remember it liquid nitrogen down here we
go<00:02:41.650> nitrogen<00:02:42.340> gas<00:02:42.370> on<00:02:42.880> top<00:02:43.210> ok<00:02:43.570> if<00:02:43.750> you<00:02:43.810> pull<00:02:44.020> up

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
go nitrogen gas on top ok if you pull up

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.750 
go nitrogen gas on top ok if you pull up
slowly<00:02:44.410> right<00:02:45.160> so<00:02:45.310> go<00:02:45.400> ahead<00:02:45.460> and<00:02:45.610> do<00:02:45.670> it

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
slowly right so go ahead and do it

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.190 
slowly right so go ahead and do it
slowly<00:02:46.300> exert<00:02:46.600> you<00:02:46.690> should<00:02:46.810> be<00:02:46.870> able<00:02:46.930> to<00:02:47.050> pull

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
slowly exert you should be able to pull

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.830 
slowly exert you should be able to pull
it<00:02:47.230> up<00:02:47.850> above<00:02:48.850> the<00:02:49.030> liquid<00:02:49.210> ok<00:02:49.510> so<00:02:49.570> now<00:02:49.720> we're

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
it up above the liquid ok so now we're

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.210 
it up above the liquid ok so now we're
just<00:02:49.870> in<00:02:50.080> the<00:02:50.110> nitrogen<00:02:50.500> gas<00:02:50.530> ok<00:02:51.010> it's<00:02:51.160> just

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
just in the nitrogen gas ok it's just

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.190
