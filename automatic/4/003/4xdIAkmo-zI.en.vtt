00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:06.359
 Hey, people, I'm here, this video. 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.069
 here I will explain to you how 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.620
 the new one works for about an hour at 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.530
 people call the wave anyway the name 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.759
 translated that stayed is an advantage - 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.770
 international for you is common 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.510
 find this pec has to look at the sky 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.699
 much like the master box that has 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.830
 blue light is going to have lightning bolts falling 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.510
 area you can use pack 1 sp1 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.939
 located in several parts of the 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.670
 map can only use it at one part per 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.990
 and if you lose you will like 1,500 points and 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.250
 it will give you a foot that is random that 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.230
 have on campus 2 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.000
 between the pecs has to put fire had 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.960
 Peak of Flavio and ended up leaving 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.030
 on here 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.520
 spider monkeys and electric chevy silva is 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.230
 get to catch that relive my jegue mine 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.730
 vision but I'm aware that no one 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.579
 So I guess I do not have the 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.289
 take these two aspects on the machine well 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.610
 The question I do not speak to you is that 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.350
 I think this little one is going to bounce 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.270
 for all the maps you have in the backoffice 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.980
 that they did with a copy of the game 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.059
 will be the only one between the maps 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.910
 I think it's going to work that way. 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.949
 between the maps because there are 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.629
 but here is a way of the state and peak 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.010
 of form for all the maps being that 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.770
 it will not be so easy for us to achieve 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.560
 the floor of florence because it has a chance of 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.810
 other pecs and they will bring several 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.799
 close to only 50 years, not only one 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.150
 question machine 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.740
 so I think it would be pretty cool, simple. 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.170
 so species back to all 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.080
 maps well after we returned to him several 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.119
 Sometimes you'll get the TV birner. 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.159
 is the name of the part that comes after a 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.110
 time to rbe is like picking up 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.939
 even a box that will change the place 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.630
 where you can use this common practice 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.880
 in China 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.799
 I'll show you the photo and then when 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.810
 I saw this loses and then you can not 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.130
 drink I do not know if the money goes 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.020
 come back or not because you do not pay attention 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.040
 that when I got to come but 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.810
 probably you should have your 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.119
 money back so well because the 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.820
 system is very similar to that of the 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.770
 bug box but he has to do is look 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.259
 the sky again to try to find where 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.869
 There are the falling rays that you will be able to 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.180
 locate this pec ii we returned in the photo 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.189
 with you in a little while but in the ground 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.630
 People you have how to get what's coming 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.009
 because you had the windows of the cars picking up 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.540
 fire stir the soil 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.579
 but I'm not entirely sure if 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.560
 then you first stretch the three 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.479
 cultivars of the machine than 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.670
 marking who will take over if you have 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.800
 how to pick up that machine review there but 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.240
 I personally hope you have it that way. 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.610
 where to do it but there is no way yet 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.610
 if you ever know citizens and do not 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.740
 you get these psp here on the ground or 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.330
 sticking jegue what solves same cup 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.490
 I've never seen anyone take the 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.960
 get caught up in the comments and asked 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.970
 a comment that is also this 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.700
 my theory says perry is coming back 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.750
 now all the maps and who make a 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.030
 good World Cup would be doing 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.530
 new good guys need here is just hope 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.530
 you enjoyed cost and until the next
