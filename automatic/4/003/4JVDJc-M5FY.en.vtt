00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
show so that's why I got it because it

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.870 
show so that's why I got it because it
came<00:00:28.140> with<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.439> box<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:28.949> it<00:00:29.279> was<00:00:29.369> only<00:00:29.609> twenty

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
came with the box and it was only twenty

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.479 
came with the box and it was only twenty
bucks<00:00:32.540> it<00:00:33.540> tipped<00:00:33.809> over<00:00:33.989> in<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.380> guys<00:00:34.530> car<00:00:34.559> and

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
bucks it tipped over in the guys car and

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.190 
bucks it tipped over in the guys car and
it<00:00:35.910> basically<00:00:36.030> started<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.809> tear<00:00:37.050> itself

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
it basically started to tear itself

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.580 
it basically started to tear itself
apart<00:00:37.500> but<00:00:38.370> it<00:00:38.460> never<00:00:38.640> went<00:00:38.790> through<00:00:39.239> I<00:00:39.500> had<00:00:40.500> to

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
apart but it never went through I had to

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
apart but it never went through I had to
tape<00:00:40.829> over<00:00:41.160> here<00:00:41.489> but<00:00:41.899> it<00:00:42.899> still<00:00:43.230> works<00:00:46.610> it's

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
tape over here but it still works it's

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.690 
tape over here but it still works it's
actually<00:00:47.940> pretty<00:00:48.120> cool<00:00:48.390> looking<00:00:49.700> chrome

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
actually pretty cool looking chrome

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:59.180 
actually pretty cool looking chrome
flames<00:00:52.730> and<00:00:55.039> dual<00:00:56.039> coil<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:57.980> don't<00:00:58.980> know<00:00:59.039> why

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
flames and dual coil I don't know why

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.279 
flames and dual coil I don't know why
they<00:00:59.370> have<00:00:59.460> separate<00:00:59.850> hookups<00:01:00.270> instead<00:01:01.140> of

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
they have separate hookups instead of

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.000 
they have separate hookups instead of
just<00:01:01.440> one<00:01:01.680> like<00:01:02.010> on<00:01:02.190> this<00:01:02.399> one<00:01:03.019> but<00:01:04.019> it's

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
just one like on this one but it's

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.399 
just one like on this one but it's
probably<00:01:05.339> cheaper<00:01:05.960> designed<00:01:06.960> I<00:01:07.110> don't<00:01:07.290> know

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
probably cheaper designed I don't know

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.240 
probably cheaper designed I don't know
we've<00:01:08.159> never<00:01:08.369> heard<00:01:08.610> of<00:01:08.729> audio<00:01:09.090> bottom<00:01:09.420> before

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
we've never heard of audio bottom before

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:21.730 
we've never heard of audio bottom before
but<00:01:11.250> it<00:01:11.340> does<00:01:11.520> look<00:01:11.580> cool<00:01:16.220> 400<00:01:17.220> watts<00:01:17.430> RMS<00:01:20.479> and

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
but it does look cool 400 watts RMS and

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.820 
but it does look cool 400 watts RMS and
1200<00:01:22.740> watts<00:01:22.920> peak<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:24.080> the<00:01:25.080> same<00:01:25.290> exact<00:01:25.619> thing

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
1200 watts peak and the same exact thing

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:32.630 
1200 watts peak and the same exact thing
goes<00:01:26.009> for<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.310> cam<00:01:26.490> would<00:01:27.920> both<00:01:28.920> 12-inch<00:01:31.640> only

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
goes for the cam would both 12-inch only

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.380 
goes for the cam would both 12-inch only
difference<00:01:33.060> is<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:34.159> the<00:01:35.159> kenwoods<00:01:35.700> magnet

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
difference is that the kenwoods magnet

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.480 
difference is that the kenwoods magnet
is<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:37.439> lot<00:01:37.740> bigger<00:01:37.920> than<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.340> audiobahn<00:01:40.490> as

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
is a lot bigger than the audiobahn as

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.690 
is a lot bigger than the audiobahn as
you<00:01:41.670> can<00:01:41.820> tell

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.780 

so<00:01:46.700> I'll<00:01:47.330> probably<00:01:47.540> end<00:01:47.810> up<00:01:47.930> using<00:01:48.140> this<00:01:48.440> one

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
so I'll probably end up using this one

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.040 
so I'll probably end up using this one
until<00:01:49.790> I<00:01:49.970> break<00:01:50.270> it<00:01:50.510> or<00:01:50.600> something<00:01:50.900> like<00:01:50.990> that

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
until I break it or something like that

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.370 
until I break it or something like that
and<00:01:51.470> I'll<00:01:52.130> just<00:01:52.400> hook<00:01:52.580> this<00:01:52.790> one<00:01:53.030> up<00:01:53.320> but<00:01:54.320> I

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
and I'll just hook this one up but I

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.830 
and I'll just hook this one up but I
still<00:01:54.680> need<00:01:54.740> my<00:01:54.890> amp<00:01:55.460> I'm<00:01:56.120> getting<00:01:56.330> a<00:01:56.540> sony
