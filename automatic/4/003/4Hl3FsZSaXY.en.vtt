in<00:01:12.080> color<00:01:21.760> you've<00:01:22.760> got<00:01:22.880> the<00:01:23.119> wing<00:01:23.270> it's<00:01:23.450> a

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:23.570 
in color you've got the wing it's a

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:32.440 
in color you've got the wing it's a
one-piece<00:01:23.990> wing<00:01:29.619> and<00:01:30.619> here<00:01:30.800> we<00:01:30.890> got<00:01:31.450> those

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
one-piece wing and here we got those

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:45.730 
one-piece wing and here we got those
cones<00:01:32.840> and<00:01:33.110> we<00:01:42.220> got<00:01:43.220> some<00:01:44.740> surveillance

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
cones and we got some surveillance

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.520 
cones and we got some surveillance
retracts<00:01:46.520> there<00:01:47.320> they're<00:01:48.320> really

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
retracts there they're really

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.020 
retracts there they're really
reinforcing<00:01:49.160> right<00:01:49.310> behind<00:01:49.550> these<00:01:49.759> hinges

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
reinforcing right behind these hinges

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.180 
reinforcing right behind these hinges
here<00:01:50.330> what<00:01:51.229> we<00:01:51.350> need<00:01:51.470> to<00:01:51.590> do<00:01:51.680> is<00:01:51.860> when<00:01:52.070> you

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
here what we need to do is when you

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:53.889 
here what we need to do is when you
insert<00:01:52.490> a<00:01:52.550> skewer<00:01:52.880> to<00:01:53.119> make<00:01:53.270> the<00:01:53.390> hole<00:01:53.539> for<00:01:53.570> the

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
insert a skewer to make the hole for the

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:56.080 
insert a skewer to make the hole for the
hinges<00:01:54.350> just<00:01:55.310> do<00:01:55.430> it<00:01:55.520> on<00:01:55.610> a<00:01:55.640> bit<00:01:55.820> of<00:01:55.850> an<00:01:55.970> angle

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
hinges just do it on a bit of an angle

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.560 
hinges just do it on a bit of an angle
so<00:01:56.450> that<00:01:56.840> misses<00:01:57.560> the<00:01:57.770> rod<00:01:58.340> and<00:01:58.610> doesn't<00:01:59.420> go

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
so that misses the rod and doesn't go

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.749 
so that misses the rod and doesn't go
through<00:01:59.720> the<00:01:59.810> skinny<00:02:00.140> line<00:02:00.440> and<00:02:01.399> you<00:02:01.610> will

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
through the skinny line and you will

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:03.160 
through the skinny line and you will
also<00:02:01.940> need<00:02:02.240> to<00:02:02.300> do<00:02:02.450> the<00:02:02.539> same<00:02:02.720> thing<00:02:02.960> with<00:02:03.050> the

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
also need to do the same thing with the

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.260 
also need to do the same thing with the
elevator<00:02:03.440> and<00:02:04.100> another<00:02:04.430> thing<00:02:04.700> in<00:02:05.060> the

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
elevator and another thing in the

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.900 
elevator and another thing in the
instruction<00:02:05.780> manual<00:02:06.429> it<00:02:07.429> doesn't<00:02:07.819> actually

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
instruction manual it doesn't actually

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.790 
instruction manual it doesn't actually
tell<00:02:08.300> you<00:02:08.420> to<00:02:08.509> put<00:02:08.690> this<00:02:08.959> is<00:02:09.110> actually<00:02:09.530> cover

tell you to put this is actually cover
pit<00:02:10.069> in<00:02:10.310> it<00:02:10.819> doesn't<00:02:11.090> tell<00:02:11.390> you<00:02:11.450> to<00:02:11.540> put<00:02:11.690> that

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
pit in it doesn't tell you to put that

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
well they write about it not being a

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:55.170 
well they write about it not being a
beginner<00:04:49.830> plane

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:19.549 

it's<00:04:55.720> pretty<00:04:55.960> quiet

00:05:19.549 --> 00:05:19.559 

00:05:19.559 --> 00:05:25.680 

Oh<00:05:19.669> special<00:05:20.669> line<00:05:20.789> for<00:05:20.909> this<00:05:20.999> trip

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:25.690 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:30.399 

good

00:05:30.399 --> 00:05:30.409 

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:35.229 

that<00:05:31.409> we<00:05:31.619> we<00:05:32.129> tip<00:05:32.999> dropped<00:05:33.329> at<00:05:33.449> the<00:05:33.569> end<00:05:33.689> there

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:35.239 
that we we tip dropped at the end there

00:05:35.239 --> 00:05:38.329 
that we we tip dropped at the end there
that's<00:05:36.239> how<00:05:36.389> the<00:05:36.449> DHA<00:05:36.989> d85<00:05:37.469> I<00:05:37.709> think<00:05:38.069> it<00:05:38.189> did

00:05:38.329 --> 00:05:38.339 
that's how the DHA d85 I think it did

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:39.679 
that's how the DHA d85 I think it did
pretty<00:05:38.489> well<00:05:38.579> considering<00:05:39.119> the<00:05:39.299> wind<00:05:39.479> you<00:05:39.569> can

00:05:39.679 --> 00:05:39.689 
pretty well considering the wind you can

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:42.049 
pretty well considering the wind you can
see<00:05:39.719> behind<00:05:39.989> me<00:05:40.229> it's<00:05:41.069> definitely<00:05:41.279> not<00:05:41.999> a

00:05:42.049 --> 00:05:42.059 
see behind me it's definitely not a

00:05:42.059 --> 00:05:43.819 
see behind me it's definitely not a
beginner<00:05:42.389> plane<00:05:42.659> either<00:05:42.989> intermediate<00:05:43.679> or

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:43.829 
beginner plane either intermediate or

00:05:43.829 --> 00:05:46.129 
beginner plane either intermediate or
advanced<00:05:44.309> and<00:05:45.059> I<00:05:45.179> did<00:05:45.360> like<00:05:45.509> to<00:05:45.659> look<00:05:45.809> that<00:05:46.019> the

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:46.139 
advanced and I did like to look that the

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:48.709 
advanced and I did like to look that the
landing<00:05:46.619> gear<00:05:46.739> gave<00:05:46.949> it<00:05:47.099> so<00:05:47.969> I<00:05:48.209> give<00:05:48.509> it<00:05:48.539> a<00:05:48.599> big

00:05:48.709 --> 00:05:48.719 
landing gear gave it so I give it a big

00:05:48.719 --> 00:06:06.529 
landing gear gave it so I give it a big
thumbs<00:05:48.989> up<00:05:49.110> and<00:05:49.409> I'll<00:05:49.860> see<00:05:49.889> you<00:05:50.129> next<00:05:50.159> time<00:06:05.539> now

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:06.539 
thumbs up and I'll see you next time now

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:13.890 
thumbs up and I'll see you next time now
the<00:06:06.599> mechanics<00:06:07.379> become<00:06:07.799> straight<00:06:08.069> apart

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:13.900 

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:17.500 

if<00:06:14.900> someone<00:06:15.260> should<00:06:15.380> put<00:06:15.560> him<00:06:15.740> there<00:06:16.390> kick<00:06:17.390> him

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:17.510 
if someone should put him there kick him

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.960 
if someone should put him there kick him
in<00:06:17.630> the<00:06:17.660> bump
