as Desiree was saying from Saint Martin
in<00:00:09.960> her<00:00:10.110> last<00:00:10.290> video<00:00:10.679> our<00:00:11.550> next<00:00:11.820> project<00:00:12.240> is<00:00:12.450> to

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
in her last video our next project is to

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.049 
in her last video our next project is to
make<00:00:12.750> the<00:00:13.110> cap<00:00:13.320> rail<00:00:13.590> and<00:00:13.920> because<00:00:14.670> of<00:00:14.700> the

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
make the cap rail and because of the

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.320 
make the cap rail and because of the
bend<00:00:15.420> that<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.490> boat<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.760> outline<00:00:18.090> of<00:00:18.119> the

boat makes we have to steam Bend the
teak<00:00:20.970> that<00:00:21.240> we're<00:00:21.359> going<00:00:21.510> to<00:00:21.570> use<00:00:21.810> so<00:00:22.410> that's

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
teak that we're going to use so that's

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.859 
teak that we're going to use so that's
what<00:00:22.710> this<00:00:22.859> is<00:00:22.920> this<00:00:23.279> is<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.490> pot<00:00:24.060> on<00:00:24.359> our<00:00:24.600> stove

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
what this is this is a pot on our stove

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.019 
what this is this is a pot on our stove
right<00:00:25.140> here<00:00:25.439> that<00:00:26.010> we've<00:00:26.160> jerry-rigged<00:00:26.789> a

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
right here that we've jerry-rigged a

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.630 
right here that we've jerry-rigged a
hose<00:00:27.570> to<00:00:28.199> connect<00:00:28.590> into<00:00:28.769> it<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.220> to<00:00:29.369> collect

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
hose to connect into it and to collect

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.790 
hose to connect into it and to collect
most<00:00:29.939> of<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.269> heat<00:00:30.480> in<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.720> steam<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.320> that's

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
most of the heat in the steam and that's

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.040 
most of the heat in the steam and that's
taking<00:00:32.399> that<00:00:32.550> heat<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:32.969> steam<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.630> our<00:00:33.809> steam

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
taking that heat and steam to our steam

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.049 
taking that heat and steam to our steam
box<00:00:34.320> where<00:00:34.920> we've<00:00:35.040> got<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.280> couple<00:00:35.640> pieces<00:00:35.880> of

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
box where we've got a couple pieces of

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.060 
box where we've got a couple pieces of
teak<00:00:36.360> in<00:00:36.540> there<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:36.930> we're<00:00:37.410> gonna<00:00:37.530> be<00:00:37.770> able<00:00:37.890> to

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
teak in there and we're gonna be able to

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.639 
teak in there and we're gonna be able to
after<00:00:38.640> about<00:00:38.820> three<00:00:39.239> hours<00:00:39.420> in<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.750> box<00:00:40.050> be

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
after about three hours in the box be

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.069 
after about three hours in the box be
able<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:41.129> apply<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:41.850> bend<00:00:42.149> it<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:42.570> let

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
able to apply it and bend it and let

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.110 
able to apply it and bend it and let
that<00:00:43.290> dry<00:00:43.620> overnight<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:44.399> then<00:00:44.910> hopefully

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
that dry overnight and then hopefully

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.840 
that dry overnight and then hopefully
that<00:00:45.329> teak<00:00:45.719> will<00:00:45.930> maintain<00:00:46.890> that<00:00:47.309> shape<00:00:47.640> so

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
that teak will maintain that shape so

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.250 
that teak will maintain that shape so
I'll<00:00:47.910> take<00:00:48.120> you<00:00:48.239> upstairs<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.780> show<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:49.050> the

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
I'll take you upstairs and show you the

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.510 
I'll take you upstairs and show you the
actual<00:00:49.440> steam<00:00:49.950> box<00:00:51.410> so<00:00:52.410> you<00:00:52.739> see<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.250> hose

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
actual steam box so you see the hose

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.959 
actual steam box so you see the hose
runs<00:00:54.059> up<00:00:54.390> out<00:00:54.780> of<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.079> cabin<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:55.710> then<00:00:56.340> into

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
runs up out of the cabin and then into

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.869 
runs up out of the cabin and then into
this<00:00:57.120> long<00:00:57.840> PVC<00:00:58.140> pipe<00:00:58.739> that's<00:00:59.070> sitting<00:00:59.730> on<00:00:59.820> top

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
this long PVC pipe that's sitting on top

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.930 
this long PVC pipe that's sitting on top
of<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.329> cabin<00:01:00.719> top<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:02.070> PVC<00:01:02.520> pipe<00:01:02.730> is

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
of the cabin top and the PVC pipe is

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.490 
of the cabin top and the PVC pipe is
supported<00:01:03.510> by<00:01:03.660> this<00:01:03.719> 2x4<00:01:04.680> because<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:06.500> it

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
supported by this 2x4 because it it

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.289 
supported by this 2x4 because it it
would<00:01:07.770> actually<00:01:08.100> start<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.369> sag<00:01:08.760> with<00:01:09.119> the

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
would actually start to sag with the

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.630 
would actually start to sag with the
heat<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.840> steam<00:01:10.260> itself<00:01:10.770> so<00:01:11.220> it<00:01:11.340> needs<00:01:11.490> to

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
heat and the steam itself so it needs to

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.330 
heat and the steam itself so it needs to
be<00:01:11.790> supported<00:01:12.530> and<00:01:13.530> then<00:01:13.650> you<00:01:13.770> can<00:01:13.920> see<00:01:14.130> here

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
be supported and then you can see here

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.390 
be supported and then you can see here
on<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.580> end<00:01:14.990> we've<00:01:15.990> got<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.229> pretty<00:01:16.830> steady

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
on the end we've got a pretty steady

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.969 
on the end we've got a pretty steady
flow<00:01:17.909> of<00:01:17.939> water<00:01:18.570> coming<00:01:19.170> out<00:01:19.409> of<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.650> end<00:01:19.799> of

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
flow of water coming out of the end of

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.760 
flow of water coming out of the end of
the<00:01:20.070> pipe<00:01:20.340> that's<00:01:20.869> condensed<00:01:21.869> water<00:01:22.049> from<00:01:22.590> the

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
the pipe that's condensed water from the

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.980 
the pipe that's condensed water from the
steam<00:01:22.979> itself<00:01:23.400> so<00:01:24.150> that's<00:01:24.210> good<00:01:24.479> news<00:01:24.630> I<00:01:24.840> mean

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
steam itself so that's good news I mean

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.630 
steam itself so that's good news I mean
the<00:01:25.110> steam<00:01:25.320> is<00:01:25.500> flowing<00:01:25.680> all<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.220> way<00:01:26.310> through

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
the steam is flowing all the way through

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.469 
the steam is flowing all the way through
the<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.600> pipe<00:01:27.930> is<00:01:28.170> pretty<00:01:28.409> hot<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:28.890> touch

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
the the pipe is pretty hot to the touch

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:33.410 
the the pipe is pretty hot to the touch
so<00:01:30.479> yeah<00:01:30.689> that's<00:01:31.009> that's<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.420> hillbilly

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
so yeah that's that's the hillbilly

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.420 
so yeah that's that's the hillbilly
atticus<00:01:34.110> steam<00:01:34.439> box<00:01:34.710> that<00:01:35.009> we'll<00:01:35.130> be<00:01:35.250> making

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
atticus steam box that we'll be making

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.210 
atticus steam box that we'll be making
the<00:01:35.790> new<00:01:35.970> rub<00:01:36.720> rail<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.259> as<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.799> can<00:01:37.890> see<00:01:38.070> over

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
the new rub rail and as you can see over

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.240 
the new rub rail and as you can see over
here<00:01:38.310> here's<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.000> old<00:01:39.180> rub<00:01:39.479> rail<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:40.250> it's

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
here here's the old rub rail and it's

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.120 
here here's the old rub rail and it's
quite<00:01:41.729> obvious<00:01:41.759> that<00:01:42.240> it's<00:01:42.630> in<00:01:42.840> need<00:01:43.079> of

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
quite obvious that it's in need of

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.870 
quite obvious that it's in need of
repair<00:01:44.270> the<00:01:45.270> woods<00:01:45.509> in<00:01:45.720> pretty<00:01:45.960> bad<00:01:46.200> shape<00:01:46.880> but

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
repair the woods in pretty bad shape but

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.870 
repair the woods in pretty bad shape but
