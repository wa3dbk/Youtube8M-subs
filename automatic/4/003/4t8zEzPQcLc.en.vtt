00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 before starting this video or 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:09.330
 make a small premise urgent waters 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:14.040
 hyena orcas to offer psn well but in wifi 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.480
 and that the baa excuse second set stops 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.699
 a moment the recording but this 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.850
 What the fuck no written not on 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.340
 seriously so now I'll explain everything not 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.980
 I went crazy all over all 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.010
 what you heard wrote it 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.630
 my iphone and you will tell the phones in 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.600
 a year a life of their own cannot 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.520
 talk can not think of then 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.190
 consequently they cannot write no 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.510
 because if you had an iphone or 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.820
 any other smartphone in 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.680
 general you will have realized that the 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.840
 very often a concealer lives of a lifetime 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.329
 his and therefore I thought of writing 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.489
 random letters on the keyboard and see 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.110
 what the concealer pulled out and 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.850
 when you thought of change keys e 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.850
 random and this was at first 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.100
 stringher that there is exit out of state 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.239
 the lesson is born because he was bored 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.930
 yes because now I'm doing 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.150
 at the University 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:08.130
 and now my brain is at all said 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.840
 there was a singetta with tongue dishes 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.060
 of homer simpson who had fallen asleep 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.150
 he took the phone and I started to 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.479
 write keys at home and came out 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.950
 a non-sense phrase though 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.409
 still a sentence with words 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.409
 that exist in the vocabulary I make a 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.110
 another small experiment I will send now 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.070
 a message to a random contact about 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.880
 Facebook 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.969
 we ask to mist the pipe 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:38.530
 so casually first contact how much 

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:40.119
 valence now let's try to reread 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:47.530
 compose set to what came out 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:52.329
 out and giuliana filled yesterday and smells e 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:54.189
 giuliana hay yesterday and smelling and jd in the e 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:55.090
 now I want to see what comes out to you 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:56.740
 leave a comment 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.810
 writing what yours 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:03.220
 smartphone has thought for you 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:06.929
 I'm curious to know what the fuck year 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.929
 our phones in the brain
