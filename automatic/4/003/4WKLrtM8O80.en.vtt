00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
this is our design and most of them we

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:07.199 
this is our design and most of them we
actually<00:03:06.100> built<00:03:06.549> although<00:03:06.880> there<00:03:07.060> were<00:03:07.180> a

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
a little bit how each compartment works

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.400 
a little bit how each compartment works
and<00:04:37.760> then<00:04:38.760> the<00:04:39.090> versatility<00:04:39.930> that<00:04:39.960> you<00:04:40.200> have

and then the versatility that you have
with<00:04:41.130> this<00:04:41.280> particular<00:04:41.580> setup<00:04:42.980> okay<00:04:43.980> now<00:04:44.220> this

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
with this particular setup okay now this

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.520 
with this particular setup okay now this
is<00:04:44.460> how<00:04:44.820> the<00:04:44.880> door<00:04:45.120> comes<00:04:45.450> up<00:04:45.660> basically

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
is how the door comes up basically

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.380 
is how the door comes up basically
they're<00:04:46.680> the<00:04:46.710> key<00:04:46.980> of<00:04:47.130> course<00:04:47.310> so<00:04:48.150> these<00:04:48.240> are

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:48.390 
they're the key of course so these are

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:50.630 
they're the key of course so these are
all<00:04:48.510> keyed<00:04:48.780> locked<00:04:49.110> and<00:04:49.800> nobody<00:04:50.370> can<00:04:50.490> get

take away very easily well this whole

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.360 
take away very easily well this whole
unit<00:05:06.900> obviously<00:05:07.020> someone<00:05:07.740> can't<00:05:08.010> just<00:05:08.190> come

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
unit obviously someone can't just come

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:05.690 
typically showing babies but that

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.170 
typically showing babies but that
basically<00:06:06.110> shows<00:06:07.100> you<00:06:07.250> the<00:06:07.370> versatility<00:06:07.820> and

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:08.180 
basically shows you the versatility and

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.720 
basically shows you the versatility and
how<00:06:08.300> you<00:06:08.360> can<00:06:08.690> use<00:06:08.720> each<00:06:09.200> of<00:06:09.380> these<00:06:09.440> spaces<00:06:09.770> or

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:10.730 
how you can use each of these spaces or

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:12.220 
how you can use each of these spaces or
you<00:06:10.850> can<00:06:11.000> use<00:06:11.150> a<00:06:11.180> double<00:06:11.390> wide<00:06:11.660> space<00:06:11.960> or<00:06:12.200> a

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:12.230 
you can use a double wide space or a

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:13.600 
you can use a double wide space or a
triple<00:06:12.440> wide<00:06:12.620> space<00:06:12.890> depending<00:06:13.250> on<00:06:13.340> the<00:06:13.430> size

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:13.610

will heat the entire space underneath

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:24.910 
will heat the entire space underneath
and<00:07:23.510> I<00:07:23.630> put<00:07:23.810> the<00:07:23.900> probes<00:07:24.170> in<00:07:24.380> there<00:07:24.620> the<00:07:24.770> two

probes in there and I'd set it for about

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:28.960 
probes in there and I'd set it for about
84<00:07:26.840> degrees<00:07:26.870> and<00:07:27.530> that'll<00:07:28.340> make<00:07:28.610> all<00:07:28.790> these
