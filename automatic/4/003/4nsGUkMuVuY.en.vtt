00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.029
 people who barely asked him for a 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.830
 team like this and do not know how to 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:29.910
 use 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.360
 I'm going to teach them 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.880
 the tricks to customize it 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.100
 good for how you can see is a 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:41.720
 blocking gang and here they appear 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:43.670
 several icons good for if you what 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.830
 they want to change what they have to do 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.150
 is to keep him pressed in the middle of 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:54.520
 these two circles until it vibrates and 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:56.140
 Here they will appear 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.200
 the icons that have been recently 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.410
 and we can see them no more drag them and 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.890
 up here 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.300
 good 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.320
 this I said it like that 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:11.680
 and good too 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.159
 I will teach you for example if you 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.159
 they want 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.680
 to change the wallpaper and not 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.570
 they want to go to the menu and then there's 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.330
 joy and all that what they can do 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.210
 is to keep pressed and here it is 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.610
 it can be to wallpapers backgrounds of 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.660
 screen of which the phone is 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.250
 these animated wallpapers 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:38.010
 like this that I have and they just have 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.410
 to download from the gallery of the 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:44.190
 images they have in their memory 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:46.950
 microsd good also if we give ourselves 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:51.270
 account increase in pressure to appear 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:53.759
 several options shortcuts and from androids 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.540
 of motorola the windows of motorola are 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:02:00.810
 these bluetooth social graphics 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:04.530
 a gps button airplane mode button and the 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:07.770
 Android widgets this are these of the 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.060
 search and twitter and facebook good 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.490
 then you want to add one of those for 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.620
 example the youtube select it and 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.170
 here it will appear 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.849
 or if it's not simply if it's me that 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.780
 Removing cement does not have to maintain 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:24.540
 pressed and move it over there or else 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:27.120
 simply eliminating here 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.040
 good if you are for example in 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.510
 this part of the screen and they want 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:35.060
 at work 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.390
 then that is returned move to here 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:42.120
 highlights what they have to do is 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:45.080
 press the icon this d 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.080
 my house 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:53.900
 for example that for each press it 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:55.720
 for example that one here and so good 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.950
 as well 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.540
 and if you want to see the 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.340
 applications that not only recently 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.020
 what they can do is maintain 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.550
 pressed the house and here they 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.740
 will offer the implications that have 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:08.260
 recently used or simply here 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.410
 they will be good as well 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.090
 this 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.600
 for example yes 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.630
 if you are 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:20.470
 me 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:22.570
 if you know the browser 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.340
 and I ask you to write, since it is 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.590
 tactile 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.660
 accustomed to the tactile what can 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.790
 to do is that for that has this 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:34.600
 microphone to search for example I'm going to 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:37.830
 search videos youtube selected 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:40.260
 Youtube videos 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:44.780
 learn to process and here they will appear 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.780
 progress states in good search 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.040
 also if you want for example 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.700
 this 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:56.670
 how to order as you want 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:04:00.120
 these icons what you can do is 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:03.900
 professionals this 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:07.349
 I miss it and here order x les 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:09.090
 will appear and a very important one that if 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:11.530
 you have many explanations if 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:15.760
 they want to move applications 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:18.010
 memory card what they can do 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.889
 is in the menu and press the bar 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.120
 options and application manager 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:24.310
 here you will see all the 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.919
 applications that you have for 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.889
 example select the 404 be I have it 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:32.440
 moved to the microsd memory that's why it 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:34.810
 it appears to me that he will move the phone and 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:38.520
 that's something that now instead of 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:41.760
 install applications that moves them and 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:44.760
 here are the groups for example 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.920
 they can 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.720
 change the icon to run your group is 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:52.710
 like a folder 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:54.320
 300 residents downloaded from all 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:57.410
 Applications 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:00.590
 it's just like a kind of good trick 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:04.670
 me that is like tips in the tips 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:08.330
 like a trick, this is a trick for 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:10.640
 me is for example that if in a video and 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:13.430
 they want a music video they want it 

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:17.030
 turn into music only and you 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:21.440
 what they do is go on computers 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:24.110
 and download and use the cache atv and 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.510
 convert videos can this be 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:28.700
 ended for this for example I 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:32.310
 I select this of holy lands as 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:35.500
 can watch the video 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:38.950
 what they have to do next 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:43.110
 personally select them and put 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:47.040
 rename and erase mp3 / mp4 and they put you 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:47.040
 mp3 ready 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:55.000
 now it became a music 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:57.100
 or if you just want it 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.260
 block video so no one can 

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:03.010
 see just erase bp's have only 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:06.400
 of 24 and they set him up and grab him like 

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:09.470
 unknown and highlights 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:14.680
 and to return to normal 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:18.500
 you are name they put mp4 either in 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:21.850
 music video 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.850
 and cut the hat again 

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:27.660
 They are like good advice types are 

00:06:25.699 --> 00:06:30.300
 advice rather 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:32.870
 I hope you liked friends and 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.870
 until next time
