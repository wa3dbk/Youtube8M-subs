come out sick I think we could get into

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.370 
come out sick I think we could get into
models<00:01:17.479> I'm<00:01:18.479> really<00:01:18.780> happy<00:01:18.930> with<00:01:19.080> how<00:01:19.229> this<00:01:19.320> is

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
models I'm really happy with how this is

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.960 
models I'm really happy with how this is
looking<00:01:19.500> especially<00:01:19.920> in<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.369> back<00:01:20.549> with

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
looking especially in the back with

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.120 
looking especially in the back with
these<00:01:21.150> two<00:01:21.659> angles<00:01:21.869> right<00:01:22.259> here<00:01:22.500> cutting<00:01:23.040> off

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
these two angles right here cutting off

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.679 
these two angles right here cutting off
the<00:01:23.250> wave<00:01:23.400> I<00:01:23.580> think<00:01:23.790> will<00:01:23.880> be<00:01:23.970> super<00:01:24.240> nice<00:01:24.390> do<00:01:24.659> a

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
the wave I think will be super nice do a

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.120 
the wave I think will be super nice do a
little<00:01:24.930> bit<00:01:25.140> I<00:01:25.320> mean<00:01:25.650> it's<00:01:25.740> not<00:01:25.799> it's<00:01:26.009> not<00:01:26.070> a

mean learn how to do stuff like that do
stuff<00:02:01.259> faster<00:02:01.770> yeah<00:02:01.890> you<00:02:02.070> know<00:02:02.159> turn<00:02:02.399> the

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
stuff faster yeah you know turn the

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.670 
stuff faster yeah you know turn the
stuff<00:02:02.759> out<00:02:02.939> quicker<00:02:03.479> so<00:02:03.780> that<00:02:03.930> we<00:02:04.020> can<00:02:04.200> spend

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
stuff out quicker so that we can spend

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.680 
stuff out quicker so that we can spend
more<00:02:04.770> time<00:02:04.920> writing<00:02:05.280> new<00:02:05.460> stuff<00:02:05.759> that<00:02:05.790> is

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
more time writing new stuff that is
