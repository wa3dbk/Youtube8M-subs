00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:28.120 
up your file manager which i will do or

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:33.630 
up your file manager which i will do or
you<00:06:29.120> can<00:06:29.450> arm<00:06:30.940> run<00:06:31.940> a<00:06:31.970> program<00:06:32.240> that<00:06:32.720> accesses

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:33.640 
you can arm run a program that accesses

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:37.450 
you can arm run a program that accesses
the<00:06:34.640> drive<00:06:35.110> here<00:06:36.110> is<00:06:36.230> my<00:06:36.410> file<00:06:36.620> manager<00:06:37.100> open

the drive here is my file manager open
and<00:06:37.610> you<00:06:37.760> will<00:06:37.910> see<00:06:38.260> right<00:06:39.260> there<00:06:39.560> it's<00:06:40.040> got

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:40.250 
and you will see right there it's got

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.730

the eject button to unmounted or if i
use<00:06:43.460> a<00:06:43.550> program<00:06:44.240> like<00:06:44.510> rhythmbox<00:06:45.310> there<00:06:46.310> it

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:46.460 
use a program like rhythmbox there it

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:48.370 
use a program like rhythmbox there it
goes<00:06:46.700> it<00:06:47.000> starts<00:06:47.330> playing<00:06:47.660> it<00:06:47.840> you<00:06:47.960> see<00:06:48.170> it<00:06:48.200> up

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:48.380 
goes it starts playing it you see it up

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:51.040 
goes it starts playing it you see it up
there<00:06:48.410> in<00:06:48.650> the<00:06:48.740> corner<00:06:49.240> it's<00:06:50.240> accessing<00:06:50.960> the

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:51.050 
there in the corner it's accessing the

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:55.150 
there in the corner it's accessing the
drive<00:06:51.320> and<00:06:51.740> that's<00:06:52.190> pretty<00:06:52.520> much<00:06:52.670> it<00:06:54.160> things

to remember like I said earlier I don't
know<00:06:59.120> if<00:06:59.390> this<00:06:59.570> will<00:06:59.750> automatically<00:07:00.320> user<00:07:00.920> or

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:01.340 
know if this will automatically user or

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:03.460 
know if this will automatically user or
what<00:07:01.730> permissions<00:07:01.970> each<00:07:02.360> user<00:07:02.600> user<00:07:03.230> will
