00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 11 draw and for you today yes 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.589
 friendly shirt prepare it 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.120
 really super easy happens for that 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.900
 it just needs such an old one 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.490
 shirt this is from h &amp; m and how much 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.170
 that may cost seven euros or 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.940
 but I just do not wear it 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.430
 and usually not much clothes anymore 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.170
 I'm thinking about something 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.300
 or something out and here 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.830
 it just changes a little bit 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.390
 not on my hands are still times 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.980
 of the color and a lean red 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.289
 Do not be surprised 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.480
 yes in any case , first needed so 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.550
 a shirt and preferably a good one 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.070
 cut the scissors because otherwise tears 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.100
 you just the substance and then you should 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.579
 start the top part from the bottom in 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.800
 cut open francs and there it is 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.840
 that you should really move on 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.579
 so she does not cut too high i 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.960
 I have decided for the height and 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.600
 It really felt like it 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.109
 Practically, yes, you would be me then 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.210
 Maybe that's how some people mix for you 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.129
 is laid out where the first step 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.040
 quite easy to knot and indeed takes 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:08.760
 the always two and just knots times 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.500
 all the way through I can 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.030
 consider the solid you pull you can 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.549
 The whole thing had to be something, of course 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.100
 make looser and if you then 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:20.390
 That should be done then 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.650
 reasonably so for the beginning 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.540
 and that is going on and on now 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.880
 Now at the next row with the 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.710
 knot it so you always have two 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.840
 is taking opposite meaning 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.630
 you see her always so strangers now 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.780
 have had a few and now you always have to 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:40.110
 then share with the other part of 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.880
 other couple social knot and here 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.490
 Can you really love the 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.030
 I have determined the strength of the knots 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.320
 They really made it very tight 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.420
 the looser you make sense 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.320
 Of course, this right cross means 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.420
 had to go out 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.969
 Of course it is also important that 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.770
 fabric is if you are afraid of that 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.299
 so to speak of the cut and how 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.680
 these unrealities remain there like 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.930
 you really do not see at the end 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.549
 and after about four or five rows 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.020
 See it all then you can 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.149
 Of course now with the club 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.319
 go like a fight and the clown 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.970
 just pull apart 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.230
 the problem is now rather stands 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.840
 shirt and as the whole 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.370
 it's easy to do it 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.250
 now, so to speak, the last series 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:23.459
 and then you just do one 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.170
 double knots so gez a whole 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.900
 normal knot then a double knot 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.030
 and that seems to be pulling tight 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.220
 Of course watch out that you are your whole 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.780
 structure does not break and now 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.379
 Will you do that a little bit more? 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.360
 see 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:42.720
 so it's so far away yes i hope that 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.890
 you like the idea and the last one 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.959
 Step is really easy then 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.239
 Of course you can do that shirt too 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.260
 to let 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.970
 I just have it very short 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.200
 cut off all those frying her 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.690
 You can also stay a bit longer 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.579
 let angular make such a triangle out of it 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.220
 do 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:03:00.420
 that's just a matter of taste and yes 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.010
 I think that may be one too 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.150
 quite good instead of just over it 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.359
 to pull the bikini 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.739
 on the beach this is the finished result 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:12.829
 and yes I hope you like it and 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:12.829
 leave me a feedback thank you
