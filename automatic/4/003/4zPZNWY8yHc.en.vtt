00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
all the rock the mountain then all the

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.570 
all the rock the mountain then all the
brush<00:01:05.420> will<00:01:05.780> work<00:01:05.990> much<00:01:06.200> better<00:01:06.260> because<00:01:06.890> you

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
brush will work much better because you

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.880 
brush will work much better because you

the brush the small brush most of the

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:45.760 
the brush the small brush most of the
time<00:01:44.000> you<00:01:44.120> use<00:01:44.360> the<00:01:44.570> small<00:01:44.840> brush<00:01:44.870> to<00:01:45.110> do<00:01:45.530> the

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
time you use the small brush to do the

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.040 
time you use the small brush to do the
peak<00:01:46.010> but<00:01:46.610> to<00:01:46.820> do<00:01:46.970> something<00:01:47.390> really<00:01:47.600> really

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050 
peak but to do something really really

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.000 
peak but to do something really really
detailed<00:01:48.650> so<00:01:48.890> only<00:01:49.790> use<00:01:50.030> the<00:01:50.270> wolf<00:01:50.710> so<00:01:51.710> this<00:01:51.920> is

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 
detailed so only use the wolf so this is

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.370 
detailed so only use the wolf so this is
our<00:01:52.159> two<00:01:52.430> most<00:01:52.850> basic<00:01:53.330> brush<00:01:53.570> then<00:01:53.870> i<00:01:53.990> would<00:01:54.170> i

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
our two most basic brush then i would i

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.350 
our two most basic brush then i would i
think<00:01:55.190> that<00:01:55.370> the<00:01:55.580> beginner<00:01:55.909> should<00:01:56.090> have

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
think that the beginner should have

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.980 
think that the beginner should have
liked<00:01:56.960> better<00:01:57.340> like<00:01:58.340> one<00:01:58.640> is<00:01:58.850> the<00:01:59.060> brush<00:01:59.570> is

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
liked better like one is the brush is

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.560 
liked better like one is the brush is
the<00:02:00.049> very<00:02:00.890> small<00:02:00.979> brush<00:02:01.460> then<00:02:02.030> the<00:02:02.180> other<00:02:02.330> one

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
the very small brush then the other one

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.870 
the very small brush then the other one
is<00:02:02.750> the<00:02:02.900> combination<00:02:03.500> brush<00:02:03.740> so<00:02:04.310> it's<00:02:04.490> not<00:02:04.670> too

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
is the combination brush so it's not too

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.539 
is the combination brush so it's not too
