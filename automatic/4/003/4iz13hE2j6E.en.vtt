00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:37.420 
about three inches on my wing and I

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:40.230 
about three inches on my wing and I
pulled<00:05:37.660> that<00:05:37.780> all<00:05:37.870> the<00:05:37.930> way<00:05:38.050> back<00:05:38.430> she<00:05:39.430> seems

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240
