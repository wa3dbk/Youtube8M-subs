00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.300
 for many battles morning and seen as being no more than a simple duty 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.269
 of every Christian 

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:09.489
 for this purpose 

00:00:09.489 --> 00:00:13.079
 to baptize means obey the commandment example of jesus 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.170
 according to the biblical records bates morning now considered over 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:22.090
 of the early church to judge by the book of deeds was administered soon. 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.029
 after with the conversion of the person this is natural 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.460
 because jesus por de nara as one of the distinctive rites of his church 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.550
 baptism is that 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.270
 it is a fact of the power of choice to order Christ to be speeded up 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.120
 well with a go statement 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.360
 decisive tito 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.250
 his disciples are leaving mateus 28 19 therefore water are visiting all 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:44.089
 actions 

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:48.499
 baptized in the name of the father of the son and the holy spirit an hour later 

00:00:48.499 --> 00:00:49.240
 Jesus 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.740
 john 15 14 - said my friends if you do because I command you 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.149
 we say 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:58.239
 what are the friends of jesus then why do not we do what he 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.239
 Send what you tell us to do if you propose to send us 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.480
 to baptize 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.200
 then we the baptism that is within 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.780
 give advice to action 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.770
 it is obedience to do what Jesus 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.970
 our goal is to make it his friends we will have to obey 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.820
 baptism and graduation in which the symbol of the death and resurrection of 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.860
 Jesus Christ 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.070
 air still protesting the unions behind it 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.170
 has one that encompasses spiritual 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.970
 fundamental to our salvation 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.030
 and it is also of a sacred character see only who uses specific pec 2 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.430
 and told them to repent of each one of you to be baptized 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.340
 In the name of Jesus Christ 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.720
 for forgiveness of the sins of receiving the sculptor of the spirit all this to 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.170
 attached 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.450
 can not happen regrets and baptism and baptism can not happen 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.290
 no regrets 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.130
 and then, afterwards, pardon forgiveness of sins, how can there be 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.110
 forgiveness of sins without repentance 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.450
 how can there be forgiveness of sins without baptism? 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.289
 we are related we can not separate with one thing from the other 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.960
 I think our pardon 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.700
 then there has to be an impediment and if we are sorry then 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.659
 consequently we will all do to demonstrate certain repeats regret 

00:02:21.279 --> 00:02:23.959
 and to demonstrate it with our love 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.920
 Christ and Christ obedience to one of the catecheses 5 to 3 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.299
 see you as you know 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:33.510
 all of whom were baptized before baptized Christians 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.169
 in his death 

00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:38.169
 behind this text you can understand the following 

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:41.540
 that we when we are baptized 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.059
 substitutes christ 

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:45.509
 we're being baptized into death be 

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:49.939
 by confessing to my baptism and my faith in Christ, I am declaring 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:52.519
 my death in christ jesus 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:56.009
 then what is much more than the belenenses also that people 

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:57.929
 but it has the spiritual side 

00:02:57.929 --> 00:03:01.170
 behind this meaning and meaning of baptism 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.730
 So which is to distribute South 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.510
 I am declaring stockpiled financing my death is Jesus hypocrisy and how 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.510
 Consequently, the resurrection is also incredible. 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:16.749
 with you chapter 2 recycler if we find ourselves buried with him at baptism 

00:03:16.749 --> 00:03:21.449
 in him also raised by faith in the power of God who raised him from among 

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:23.699
 The deads 

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:27.260
 by airport what we did not want in the baptized baptized 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.900
 it's as if we had deviated 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.799
 I do not want to be buried with Christ 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:35.530
 I do not want to be resurrected with soft christ. 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.829
 receive what Christ gave me 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:43.909
 that victory through the death of his resurrection pina how I 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:45.099
 I can believe that 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:48.199
 and not by confessing in practice my baptism 

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:51.369
 not but repeatedly rejects that his baptism 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:54.749
 she is the burial of Christ 

00:03:54.749 --> 00:03:58.509
 It is the resurrection of Christ so it is my death and also my death. 

00:03:58.509 --> 00:04:00.279
 resurrection in christ 

00:04:00.279 --> 00:04:04.469
 there the spiritual meaning that lies behind it is more than 

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:06.430
 simply with an obedience 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.229
 the words of jesus christ 

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:11.140
 we can not despise baptism has water 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.069
 I aim to consider it means before 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:18.769
 if I went away from March and that therefore the church of christ of the first century and the 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.009
 Jesus himself did not despise the baptism of John 

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:23.210
 considered as 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.430
 I fully realize that this 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.210
 What should our attitude be? 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:29.480
 filipe reis 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.020
 this new the gospel 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.890
 of Christ 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:35.249
 there the duke and uncle did not forget 

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:36.870
 penguin and wasted 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.020
 the baptism in water 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.169
 taught its importance 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:46.129
 and his worth so that he the eunuch who has forsaken the need and believe in the 

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:50.210
 baptism of bodoquena first the bike he encountered 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:51.800
 he did not resist 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.900
 he wanted to baptize the one who was baptized by felipÃ£o 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.670
 we have this text 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.940
 in attica petroleum 35 36 and 38 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:03.969
 and going they walking get to the foot 

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:08.419
 diogo magician and said that the block is the team now what matters is that everything 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:10.240
 be baptized 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.439
 then the 38 ordered the car to stop and both abortion came down 

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:17.740
 both filipe with the support of the course 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.719
 worst part south 

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:25.110
 it is necessary to consider what baptism has only been valid when preceded by the 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:29.779
 repentance of sins and conversion of the person to the Lord Jesus of 

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:32.969
 according to the petro artist 2005 38 

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:34.270
 and also 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.699
 is when it is preceded by faith then this 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:40.830
 the importance of baptism 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.860
 renamed without faith with a doubtful heart 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.479
 believing of the proposed ones and in the importance of baptism 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:50.999
 is to sin against jesus christ 

00:05:50.999 --> 00:05:52.930
 for the life of the dis 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.040
 everything that does not come from faith 

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.869
 it is sin 

00:05:55.869 --> 00:05:58.650
 bernardes 2 38 and I told them Peter 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:00.919
 repent and each of you 

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:05.889
 baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins and I will receive 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:08.009
 shield of the holy spirit 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:10.030
 like the 14 23 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:14.990
 but the one who has doubts and coli who is doomed for not eating by 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.490
 faith 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:18.490
 and everything because it is not different is sin 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.710
 we can do nothing for our salvation 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:24.210
 if we do not have faith 

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:26.839
 in jesus christ as our savior 

00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:28.189
 So 

00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:32.759
 the true faith that is indispensable for baptism has water 

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:34.669
 you can not baptize someone 

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:37.569
 I know that we should try to visit the 

00:06:37.569 --> 00:06:38.830
 in jesus christ 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:40.309
 and at baptism 

00:06:40.309 --> 00:06:43.549
 baptism and water 

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:47.240
 I have value so that she the person 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.099
 who has already received 

00:06:49.099 --> 00:06:54.330
 the spiritual baptism that is to that person who already received Jesus Christ his 

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:55.180
 heart 

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:55.960
 it's already gone 

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.509
 by faith 

00:06:57.509 --> 00:07:03.710
 buried with Christ and resurrected with Christ for this person who believes in it 

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:05.389
