00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
little bit of a test of a tripod head

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.340 
little bit of a test of a tripod head
that<00:00:05.700> I<00:00:05.730> just<00:00:05.970> got<00:00:06.150> and<00:00:06.420> this<00:00:06.810> is<00:00:06.990> the<00:00:07.140> best

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
that I just got and this is the best

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.629 
that I just got and this is the best
core<00:00:07.740> MP<00:00:08.309> 101<00:00:09.120> video<00:00:09.590> motorized<00:00:10.590> panhead<00:00:11.460> and

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
core MP 101 video motorized panhead and

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.549 
core MP 101 video motorized panhead and
so<00:00:12.150> basically<00:00:12.509> this<00:00:12.719> is<00:00:12.780> just<00:00:12.929> a<00:00:13.139> motorized

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
so basically this is just a motorized

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.259 
so basically this is just a motorized
tripod<00:00:14.160> head<00:00:14.340> that<00:00:14.700> you<00:00:14.759> can<00:00:14.940> control

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
tripod head that you can control

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.330 
tripod head that you can control
remotely<00:00:15.660> and<00:00:15.960> this<00:00:16.440> is<00:00:16.560> going<00:00:16.710> to<00:00:16.770> enable<00:00:17.220> you

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
remotely and this is going to enable you

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.970 
remotely and this is going to enable you
to<00:00:17.369> have<00:00:17.640> really<00:00:18.240> really<00:00:18.720> smooth<00:00:19.050> pans<00:00:19.410> as<00:00:19.650> you

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
to have really really smooth pans as you

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.550 
to have really really smooth pans as you
can<00:00:20.100> see<00:00:20.310> it's<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.580> very<00:00:20.910> smooth<00:00:21.359> image<00:00:21.660> um<00:00:22.109> this

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
can see it's a very smooth image um this

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.590 
can see it's a very smooth image um this
is<00:00:22.710> just<00:00:22.859> video<00:00:23.609> showing<00:00:23.970> it<00:00:24.150> how<00:00:24.300> it<00:00:24.449> actually

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
is just video showing it how it actually

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.660 
is just video showing it how it actually
works<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.650> full<00:00:25.859> review<00:00:26.160> that<00:00:26.340> I<00:00:26.369> will<00:00:26.519> do

footage of the camera actually being on

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.359 
footage of the camera actually being on
it<00:00:30.390> but<00:00:30.840> this<00:00:30.990> is<00:00:31.050> a<00:00:31.199> motorized<00:00:31.710> tripod<00:00:32.219> head

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369

it but this is a motorized tripod head
you<00:00:32.790> can<00:00:32.969> control<00:00:33.300> it<00:00:33.450> you<00:00:33.899> can<00:00:34.050> see<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.380> back

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
you can control it you can see the back

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:35.959 
you can control it you can see the back
panel<00:00:35.040> there<00:00:35.160> has<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.370> couple<00:00:35.700> different

settings<00:00:36.149> in<00:00:36.750> terms<00:00:36.960> of<00:00:37.110> degrees<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:38.489> can

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
settings in terms of degrees and you can

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.520 
settings in terms of degrees and you can
set<00:00:38.790> it<00:00:38.879> for<00:00:38.910> manual<00:00:39.480> or<00:00:39.629> auto<00:00:39.899> you<00:00:40.140> can<00:00:40.290> set<00:00:40.440> it

set it for manual or auto you can set it

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.139 
set it for manual or auto you can set it
just<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.800> go<00:00:40.890> back<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.280> forth<00:00:41.520> automatically

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
just to go back and forth automatically

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.880 
just to go back and forth automatically
through<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.420> cycle<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.110> it<00:00:43.559> has<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.829> ability

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
through the cycle and it has the ability

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.029 
through the cycle and it has the ability
to<00:00:44.579> be<00:00:44.730> either<00:00:45.510> used<00:00:45.870> with<00:00:46.110> four<00:00:46.559> double<00:00:46.890> A

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
to be either used with four double A

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.369 
to be either used with four double A
batteries<00:00:47.070> or<00:00:47.730> an<00:00:48.239> AC<00:00:48.390> adapter<00:00:48.629> now

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
batteries or an AC adapter now

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.229 
batteries or an AC adapter now
personally<00:00:49.680> I<00:00:49.950> just<00:00:50.070> got<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.520> AC<00:00:50.670> adapter

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
personally I just got the AC adapter

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.420 
personally I just got the AC adapter
right<00:00:51.480> after<00:00:51.809> I<00:00:51.840> film<00:00:52.140> this<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.440> it<00:00:53.250> is<00:00:53.399> a

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
right after I film this and it is a

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.549 
right after I film this and it is a
pretty<00:00:53.670> good<00:00:54.059> increase<00:00:54.449> in<00:00:54.629> speed<00:00:54.960> it's

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
pretty good increase in speed it's

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.049 
pretty good increase in speed it's
actually<00:00:55.890> 30<00:00:56.039> seconds<00:00:56.520> quicker<00:00:56.760> going

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
actually 30 seconds quicker going

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.639 
actually 30 seconds quicker going
through<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.480> whole<00:00:57.629> cycle<00:00:57.899> using<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.500> AC

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
through the whole cycle using the AC

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.099 
through the whole cycle using the AC
adapter<00:00:59.280> but<00:00:59.760> these<00:01:00.030> this<00:01:00.329> video<00:01:00.899> right<00:01:01.079> here

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
adapter but these this video right here

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.779 
adapter but these this video right here
is<00:01:01.440> with<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.800> double<00:01:02.070> A<00:01:02.129> batteries<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.699> it

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
is with the double A batteries and it

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.460 
is with the double A batteries and it
does<00:01:02.940> pretty<00:01:03.149> good<00:01:03.239> so<00:01:03.960> before<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:04.439> were

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
does pretty good so before you were

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.170 
does pretty good so before you were
seeing<00:01:04.769> some<00:01:04.949> horizontal<00:01:05.220> movement<00:01:05.909> now<00:01:06.060> it

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
seeing some horizontal movement now it

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.090 
seeing some horizontal movement now it
doesn't<00:01:06.360> actually<00:01:06.570> go<00:01:06.869> 360<00:01:07.650> degrees<00:01:07.920> it

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
doesn't actually go 360 degrees it

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.890 
doesn't actually go 360 degrees it
almost<00:01:08.369> gets<00:01:08.640> there<00:01:08.790> but<00:01:08.970> not<00:01:09.090> quite<00:01:09.150> but<00:01:09.780> now

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
almost gets there but not quite but now

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.690 
almost gets there but not quite but now
you're<00:01:10.080> also<00:01:10.200> seeing<00:01:10.560> some<00:01:10.710> up-and-down<00:01:11.430> I

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
you're also seeing some up-and-down I

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.460 
you're also seeing some up-and-down I
think<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.180> has<00:01:12.270> just<00:01:12.540> right<00:01:12.960> around<00:01:13.140> 30

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
think it has just right around 30

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:13.880 
think it has just right around 30
degrees

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
degrees

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.429 
degrees
I'm<00:01:14.310> completely<00:01:14.939> up<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.299> down<00:01:15.509> 15<00:01:15.990> degrees<00:01:16.259> up

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
I'm completely up and down 15 degrees up

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.260 
I'm completely up and down 15 degrees up
15<00:01:16.799> degrees<00:01:17.070> down<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.850> nice<00:01:18.030> thing<00:01:18.240> about

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
15 degrees down and a nice thing about

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.179 
15 degrees down and a nice thing about
this<00:01:18.570> tripod<00:01:19.049> head<00:01:19.200> is<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:20.040> can

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
this tripod head is that you can

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.039 
this tripod head is that you can
actually<00:01:20.580> move<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.119> horizontally<00:01:21.869> and

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
actually move it horizontally and

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.080 
actually move it horizontally and
vertically<00:01:22.500> at<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.799> same<00:01:23.070> time<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.700> so<00:01:24.000> you

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
vertically at the same time and so you

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.030 
vertically at the same time and so you
can<00:01:24.210> get<00:01:24.270> some<00:01:24.450> nice<00:01:24.600> shots<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.259> right<00:01:25.830> here

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
can get some nice shots and right here

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.740 
can get some nice shots and right here
now<00:01:26.159> you<00:01:26.189> can<00:01:26.430> see<00:01:26.640> this<00:01:26.970> is<00:01:27.180> basically<00:01:27.570> the

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
now you can see this is basically the

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.240 
now you can see this is basically the
control<00:01:28.049> that<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.200> get<00:01:28.439> it's<00:01:28.619> not<00:01:28.740> fancy<00:01:29.070> or

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
control that you get it's not fancy or

don't have a slower pane or a longer pan

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.300 
don't have a slower pane or a longer pan
but<00:01:37.079> I<00:01:37.140> really<00:01:37.380> just<00:01:37.500> like<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.829> fact<00:01:38.070> that<00:01:38.250> you

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
but I really just like the fact that you

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.700 
but I really just like the fact that you
can<00:01:38.520> pay<00:01:38.970> in<00:01:39.030> sideways<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:39.900> vertically<00:01:40.439> at

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
can pay in sideways and vertically at

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.190 
can pay in sideways and vertically at
the<00:01:40.829> same<00:01:41.040> exact<00:01:41.400> time<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.939> so<00:01:42.450> now<00:01:42.479> we<00:01:43.049> are

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
the same exact time and so now we are

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.719 
the same exact time and so now we are
seeing<00:01:43.439> it<00:01:43.560> going<00:01:43.829> automatically<00:01:44.460> without

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
seeing it going automatically without

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.149 
seeing it going automatically without
the<00:01:44.880> remote<00:01:45.000> installed<00:01:45.659> whatsoever<00:01:46.170> now<00:01:46.649> you

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
the remote installed whatsoever now you

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.499 
the remote installed whatsoever now you
can<00:01:47.310> just<00:01:47.399> kind<00:01:47.670> of<00:01:47.729> set<00:01:47.939> this<00:01:48.030> up<00:01:48.240> somewhere

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
can just kind of set this up somewhere

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.179 
can just kind of set this up somewhere
and<00:01:48.899> just<00:01:48.930> have<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.200> pan<00:01:49.530> back<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:49.950> forth

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
and just have a pan back and forth

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.920 
and just have a pan back and forth
during<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.820> whole<00:01:50.970> recording<00:01:51.420> just<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.750> get

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
during the whole recording just to get

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.539
