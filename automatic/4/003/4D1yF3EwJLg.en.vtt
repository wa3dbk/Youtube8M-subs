00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.510 

on<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.260> tree<00:00:33.770> so<00:00:34.770> you've<00:00:34.920> got<00:00:34.950> it<00:00:35.250> like<00:00:35.489> that

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
on the tree so you've got it like that

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.540 
on the tree so you've got it like that
and<00:00:35.940> it<00:00:36.390> took<00:00:36.540> two<00:00:36.809> fingers<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:37.559> pass<00:00:38.400> it

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
and it took two fingers and pass it

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.950 
and it took two fingers and pass it
round<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.470> finger<00:00:40.850> while<00:00:41.850> twisting<00:00:42.629> round

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
round the finger while twisting round

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.960 
round the finger while twisting round
the<00:00:43.199> rope<00:00:43.410> let's<00:00:44.250> bring<00:00:44.430> this<00:00:44.520> up<00:00:44.699> a<00:00:44.730> loop

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:44.970 
the rope let's bring this up a loop

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:51.740 
the rope let's bring this up a loop
through<00:00:46.010> write<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:48.530> loop<00:00:50.269> you<00:00:51.269> can<00:00:51.329> pull<00:00:51.629> this

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
through write a loop you can pull this

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.620 
through write a loop you can pull this
out

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:56.630 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.720 

isn't<00:00:57.630> there<00:00:57.720> we<00:00:57.810> go<00:00:57.930> anywhere

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
isn't there we go anywhere

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.240 
isn't there we go anywhere
so<00:01:00.180> that's<00:01:00.450> a<00:01:00.600> quick<00:01:00.750> release<00:01:01.050> first<00:01:01.890> not<00:01:02.220> the

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
so that's a quick release first not the

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.340 
so that's a quick release first not the
attar

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.780 

alright<00:01:09.350> so<00:01:09.770> now<00:01:09.920> the<00:01:09.980> second<00:01:10.430> up<00:01:10.520> we're<00:01:10.670> going

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
alright so now the second up we're going

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.020 
alright so now the second up we're going
to<00:01:10.880> use<00:01:11.090> and<00:01:11.420> redo<00:01:11.900> is<00:01:12.830> a<00:01:12.890> tart<00:01:13.340> tall<00:01:13.820> tuning

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
to use and redo is a tart tall tuning

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.800 
to use and redo is a tart tall tuning
not<00:01:15.400> again<00:01:16.400> I'm<00:01:17.090> going<00:01:17.240> to<00:01:17.300> bring<00:01:17.480> it<00:01:17.570> round

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
not again I'm going to bring it round

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.830 
not again I'm going to bring it round
the<00:01:17.990> tree<00:01:19.090> this<00:01:20.090> time<00:01:20.360> we're<00:01:20.540> going<00:01:20.630> to<00:01:20.690> go

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
the tree this time we're going to go

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.870 
the tree this time we're going to go
over<00:01:22.240> Luke<00:01:23.240> we<00:01:23.390> just<00:01:23.600> made<00:01:23.840> round<00:01:24.200> the<00:01:24.320> tree

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
over Luke we just made round the tree

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.190 
over Luke we just made round the tree
and<00:01:25.880> you're<00:01:26.540> going<00:01:26.630> to<00:01:26.720> be<00:01:26.780> pulling<00:01:26.960> this

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
and you're going to be pulling this

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.790 
and you're going to be pulling this
tight<00:01:28.120> and<00:01:29.120> you're<00:01:29.330> going<00:01:29.450> to<00:01:29.510> go<00:01:29.630> back<00:01:29.930> the

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:30.800 
tight and you're going to go back the

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:37.210 
tight and you're going to go back the
other<00:01:30.830> way<00:01:31.040> round<00:01:31.160> the<00:01:31.640> tree<00:01:33.220> come<00:01:34.220> over<00:01:36.220> then

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
other way round the tree come over then

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.160 
other way round the tree come over then
we're<00:01:37.550> going<00:01:37.670> to<00:01:37.730> come<00:01:37.790> back<00:01:38.180> towards<00:01:39.020> the

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
we're going to come back towards the

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:45.610 
we're going to come back towards the
tree<00:01:39.640> pull<00:01:40.640> tight<00:01:42.010> and<00:01:43.010> create<00:01:43.340> a<00:01:43.370> loop<00:01:44.620> and

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:45.620 
tree pull tight and create a loop and

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.680 
tree pull tight and create a loop and
again<00:01:47.230> so<00:01:48.230> joyful<00:01:48.770> noise<00:01:48.890> or<00:01:49.160> the<00:01:49.220> kids

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
we're going to do

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.620 
we're going to do
quick<00:02:01.880> release<00:02:02.240> tarp<00:02:03.200> not<00:02:03.470> for<00:02:03.680> the<00:02:03.770> end<00:02:04.630> so

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
quick release tarp not for the end so

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.469 
quick release tarp not for the end so
first<00:02:05.990> take<00:02:06.890> the<00:02:07.040> loop<00:02:07.220> I'm<00:02:08.149> doing<00:02:08.420> this

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
first take the loop I'm doing this

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:09.910 
first take the loop I'm doing this
around<00:02:08.690> my<00:02:08.780> body<00:02:08.990> because<00:02:09.380> it<00:02:09.530> can't<00:02:09.710> find

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
around my body because it can't find

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.370 
around my body because it can't find
anywhere<00:02:10.729> else<00:02:10.789> dark<00:02:11.150> enough<00:02:11.420> the<00:02:12.170> white

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
anywhere else dark enough the white

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.700 
anywhere else dark enough the white
string<00:02:12.710> so<00:02:13.010> take<00:02:13.850> it<00:02:13.880> behind<00:02:14.560> through<00:02:15.560> the

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
string so take it behind through the

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.420 
string so take it behind through the
loop<00:02:15.890> I'm<00:02:16.730> going<00:02:16.880> to<00:02:16.970> do<00:02:17.030> that<00:02:17.180> again<00:02:18.430> push

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
loop I'm going to do that again push

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:20.949 
loop I'm going to do that again push
them<00:02:19.640> up<00:02:19.670> and<00:02:20.090> then<00:02:20.209> we're<00:02:20.330> going<00:02:20.450> to<00:02:20.510> push

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
them up and then we're going to push

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.270 
them up and then we're going to push
these<00:02:21.170> two<00:02:21.410> to<00:02:21.590> give<00:02:21.800> us<00:02:21.950> and<00:02:22.790> go<00:02:23.000> round<00:02:24.280> round

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
these two to give us and go round round

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.840 
these two to give us and go round round
again

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.780 

and<00:02:28.330> then<00:02:28.560> capture<00:02:29.560> the<00:02:29.680> loop

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.960 

brew

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.010 

and<00:02:36.210> push<00:02:36.510> it<00:02:36.630> a<00:02:36.720> lot

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.290 

a<00:02:39.080> little<00:02:39.740> time

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
a little time

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.650 
a little time
now<00:02:41.780> we<00:02:41.840> have<00:02:42.020> it

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
now we have it

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.690 
now we have it
slides<00:02:44.290> up<00:02:44.880> don't<00:02:45.880> slide<00:02:46.120> back<00:02:46.360> down

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
slides up don't slide back down

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.900 
slides up don't slide back down
okay<00:02:48.330> just<00:02:49.290> shot<00:02:49.650> put<00:02:49.920> police

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.150 

we<00:02:53.360> got

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
we got

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:05.480 
we got
