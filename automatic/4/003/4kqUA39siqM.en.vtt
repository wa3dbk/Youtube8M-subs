00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:03.540 
the back in the handle and then let's

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.119 
the back in the handle and then let's
fight<00:01:03.750> about<00:01:03.900> that<00:01:04.199> depending<00:01:04.710> what<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:04.920> want

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
fight about that depending what you want

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.900 
fight about that depending what you want
that's<00:01:06.000> five<00:01:06.300> in<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.600> defender<00:01:07.080> you<00:01:09.320> you<00:01:10.910> mark

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:11.910 
that's five in the defender you you mark

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.570 
that's five in the defender you you mark
it<00:01:12.090> talking<00:01:12.750> till<00:01:12.990> it<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.350> then<00:01:14.190> you<00:01:14.340> put<00:01:14.550> the

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
it talking till it and then you put the

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.120 
it talking till it and then you put the
entity<00:01:15.090> you<00:01:15.450> put<00:01:16.200> eventually<00:01:16.530> a<00:01:16.560> cleaner<00:01:16.830> and

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
entity you put eventually a cleaner and

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.740 
entity you put eventually a cleaner and
you<00:01:17.220> just<00:01:17.370> stick<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.610> skipper<00:01:18.000> I<00:01:18.210> just<00:01:18.450> use<00:01:18.600> the

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
you just stick a skipper I just use the

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.359 
you just stick a skipper I just use the
old<00:01:18.900> plane<00:01:19.200> but<00:01:19.410> I<00:01:19.440> got<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.740> plane<00:01:20.010> over<00:01:20.070> here

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
old plane but I got a plane over here

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.940 
old plane but I got a plane over here
that<00:01:20.850> makes<00:01:21.030> it<00:01:21.150> a<00:01:21.210> bit<00:01:21.330> easier<00:01:21.360> from<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.170> I

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
that makes it a bit easier from and I

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.330 
that makes it a bit easier from and I
did<00:01:23.160> that<00:01:25.820> that's<00:01:26.820> why<00:01:27.030> they're<00:01:27.210> there<00:01:27.240> police

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
did that that's why they're there police

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.430 
did that that's why they're there police
