00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.069
 hello today I show you how we are 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.269
 do it Yourself 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.900
 For this, the following need fresh 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.460
 gums 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.099
 I have them here they are already ripe 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:18.000
 was the need to see from us the 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.660
 We also have to be beautiful and they must be beautiful 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.609
 are sharp 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.269
 then I drop here again 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:27.029
 dried chillies are whole and 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:31.080
 Of course we need it for that 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.870
 now here's the little bottle and the oil 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.640
 because the oil does not have to be here 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.690
 protected from light wakes you need 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:45.950
 Do not take a gunkel bottle so now 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.950
 I'm from the struck 12 pieces 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:55.530
 nice big ones from the fresh cds 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:59.760
 also turned away I think there is enough 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:02.370
 one in this very sharp then 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.719
 I still write her the green because 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.979
 We do not want to have that with oil 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:16.729
 terrible decides in the middle 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:16.729
 through her you can already see beautiful 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:32.509
 and then I put that simply here 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:32.509
 confess oil 1 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:42.570
 the little one turns in then too 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:47.700
 Let's forget that the airtight 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:50.070
 is closed then it is not true that 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:54.539
 and leave it for about two weeks 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:58.110
 After two weeks, the oil gets 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:02:00.780
 then a slight orange tint because 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.149
 the capsaicin is relatively oil 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.630
 slowly dissolves over two weeks are 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.369
 to let 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.990
 Of course we can also use olive oil 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.269
 but take a dark 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.640
 bottle because it is not protected 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:14.730
 It must be kept fast 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.700
 bad is was after two weeks 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.519
 which is used to fry salad 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.569
 no problem tastes total.com if 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:23.760
 he also wanted a few more 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.599
 meet fresh friends and easy 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.209
 to let go 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:29.599
 that was much fun to 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.599
 do it Yourself
