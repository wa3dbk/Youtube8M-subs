here are manufacturers really placing
their<00:00:20.369> bets<00:00:20.550> on<00:00:20.760> alternative<00:00:21.720> energies

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
their bets on alternative energies

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.189 
their bets on alternative energies
because<00:00:23.039> 33<00:00:23.670> of<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.939> cars<00:00:24.359> are<00:00:24.600> are<00:00:24.750> hybrids

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
because 33 of the cars are are hybrids

because 33 of the cars are are hybrids
right<00:00:25.470> right<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:26.039> there's<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.250> car<00:00:26.970> powered<00:00:27.330> by

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
right right and there's a car powered by

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.349 
right right and there's a car powered by
natural<00:00:27.480> gas<00:00:27.960> on<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.500> list<00:00:28.939> what<00:00:29.939> I<00:00:30.060> think

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
natural gas on the list what I think

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.450 
natural gas on the list what I think
what<00:00:30.689> we<00:00:30.900> were<00:00:31.050> what<00:00:31.590> we<00:00:31.679> were<00:00:31.769> surprised<00:00:32.250> to

what we were what we were surprised to

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.130 
what we were what we were surprised to
find<00:00:32.700> is<00:00:32.910> that<00:00:32.940> there<00:00:33.180> in<00:00:33.329> fact<00:00:33.360> weren't<00:00:33.930> more

this<00:00:42.450> year<00:00:42.510> is<00:00:42.750> just<00:00:42.960> dominated<00:00:43.680> by<00:00:43.770> like

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
this year is just dominated by like

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.830 
this year is just dominated by like
traditional<00:00:44.520> gas<00:00:45.120> powered<00:00:45.480> internal

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
combustion engines why is that exactly

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.060 
combustion engines why is that exactly
um<00:00:48.090> because<00:00:48.480> it<00:00:48.989> turns<00:00:49.260> out<00:00:49.440> that<00:00:49.500> just<00:00:49.860> you

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
um because it turns out that just you

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.069 
um because it turns out that just you
know<00:00:50.160> building<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.579> small<00:00:51.059> lightweight<00:00:51.600> car

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
know building a small lightweight car

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.299 
know building a small lightweight car
that<00:00:52.260> uses<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.530> small<00:00:52.800> lightweight

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309

that uses a small lightweight
four-cylinder<00:00:53.789> engine<00:00:54.570> is<00:00:54.809> in<00:00:54.989> most<00:00:55.170> cases

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
four-cylinder engine is in most cases

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.170 
four-cylinder engine is in most cases
more<00:00:55.770> efficient<00:00:56.280> that<00:00:56.430> okay<00:00:56.699> you<00:00:56.940> know<00:00:57.030> like<00:00:57.149> a

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
more efficient that okay you know like a

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.910 
more efficient that okay you know like a
big<00:00:57.420> luxurious<00:00:57.629> idiom<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:58.199> just<00:00:58.590> happens<00:00:58.829> to

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
big luxurious idiom that just happens to

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.799 
big luxurious idiom that just happens to
have<00:00:58.949> like<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.190> hybrid<00:00:59.460> so<00:00:59.850> so<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.510> technology

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
have like a hybrid so so the technology

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.340 
have like a hybrid so so the technology
isn't<00:01:01.410> really<00:01:02.010> there<00:01:02.219> yet<00:01:02.480> um<00:01:03.480> it's<00:01:03.809> not<00:01:03.989> if

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
isn't really there yet um it's not if

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.020 
isn't really there yet um it's not if
the<00:01:04.619> technology<00:01:04.799> is<00:01:05.189> getting<00:01:05.369> there<00:01:05.640> but<00:01:05.850> it's

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
the technology is getting there but it's

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.460 
the technology is getting there but it's
I<00:01:06.240> think<00:01:06.299> I<00:01:06.689> think<00:01:06.930> it's<00:01:07.020> not<00:01:07.170> quite

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
I think I think it's not quite

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.560 
I think I think it's not quite
widespread<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.400> point<00:01:08.670> where<00:01:08.939> you<00:01:09.420> know

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
widespread to the point where you know

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.109 
widespread to the point where you know
if<00:01:10.380> you're<00:01:10.619> shopping<00:01:10.890> for<00:01:11.070> an<00:01:11.700> entry-level

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
if you're shopping for an entry-level

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.179 
if you're shopping for an entry-level
compact<00:01:12.869> car<00:01:13.170> you're<00:01:13.770> not<00:01:13.890> going<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.100> find

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
compact car you're not going to find

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.950 
compact car you're not going to find
anything<00:01:14.430> more<00:01:14.850> efficient<00:01:15.240> than<00:01:15.390> like<00:01:15.630> just<00:01:15.869> a

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
anything more efficient than like just a

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.899 
anything more efficient than like just a
classic<00:01:16.229> honda<00:01:16.680> civic<00:01:17.100> or<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.340> Ford<00:01:17.700> Focus

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
classic honda civic or a Ford Focus

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.850 
classic honda civic or a Ford Focus
there<00:01:18.270> really<00:01:18.479> isn't<00:01:18.810> like<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:19.110> hybrid<00:01:19.380> of<00:01:19.619> yeah

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
there really isn't like a hybrid of yeah

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.859 
there really isn't like a hybrid of yeah
but<00:01:20.310> I<00:01:20.549> made<00:01:20.759> in<00:01:20.880> that<00:01:20.970> in<00:01:21.150> that<00:01:21.210> vehicle<00:01:21.479> class

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
but I made in that in that vehicle class

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.200 
but I made in that in that vehicle class
sure<00:01:22.409> but<00:01:22.740> I<00:01:22.770> mean<00:01:22.979> nonetheless<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.939> looks

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
sure but I mean nonetheless it looks

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.740 
sure but I mean nonetheless it looks
like<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.479> Prius<00:01:24.810> has<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.560> lowest<00:01:25.799> cost<00:01:26.750> for

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
like the Prius has the lowest cost for

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.210 
like the Prius has the lowest cost for
fueling<00:01:28.140> Louis<00:01:28.409> annual<00:01:28.710> right<00:01:28.950> so<00:01:29.070> you'll

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
fueling Louis annual right so you'll

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.740 
fueling Louis annual right so you'll
notice<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.610> right<00:01:29.850> you'll<00:01:30.060> notice<00:01:30.329> that<00:01:30.360> the

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
notice the right you'll notice that the

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.030 
notice the right you'll notice that the
price<00:01:31.049> of<00:01:31.200> that<00:01:31.290> car<00:01:31.470> is<00:01:31.590> over<00:01:31.799> twenty

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
price of that car is over twenty

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.460 
price of that car is over twenty
thousand<00:01:32.400> dollars<00:01:32.670> so<00:01:33.060> if<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:33.780> know<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:34.140> you

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
thousand dollars so if you know it you

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.499 
thousand dollars so if you know it you
might<00:01:34.710> save<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.159> thousand<00:01:35.850> dollars<00:01:36.090> on<00:01:36.240> fuel

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
might save a thousand dollars on fuel

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:37.789

trend<00:03:07.680> at<00:03:08.220> first<00:03:08.940> was<00:03:09.330> you<00:03:09.900> know<00:03:10.020> hybrid<00:03:10.560> cars

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
trend at first was you know hybrid cars

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.770 
trend at first was you know hybrid cars
had<00:03:11.040> less<00:03:11.220> horsepower<00:03:11.490> or<00:03:12.000> less<00:03:12.150> performance

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
had less horsepower or less performance

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:13.910 
had less horsepower or less performance
you<00:03:13.050> know<00:03:13.170> when<00:03:13.320> you<00:03:13.410> drove<00:03:13.560> a<00:03:13.680> first

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
you know when you drove a first

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.410 
you know when you drove a first
generation<00:03:14.100> Prius<00:03:14.730> up<00:03:14.940> the<00:03:15.060> side<00:03:15.240> of<00:03:15.270> a

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
generation Prius up the side of a

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.970 
generation Prius up the side of a
mountain<00:03:15.450> it<00:03:15.900> was<00:03:16.020> like<00:03:16.170> riding<00:03:16.380> a<00:03:16.530> lawn<00:03:16.709> mower

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
mountain it was like riding a lawn mower

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.190 
mountain it was like riding a lawn mower
but<00:03:17.310> now<00:03:17.550> the<00:03:17.610> trend<00:03:18.180> is<00:03:18.450> toward<00:03:18.870> using

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
but now the trend is toward using

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.280 
but now the trend is toward using
hybrids<00:03:19.890> to<00:03:20.070> enhance<00:03:20.430> the<00:03:21.150> performance<00:03:21.720> chops

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
hybrids to enhance the performance chops

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.740 
hybrids to enhance the performance chops
of<00:03:22.440> the<00:03:22.560> car<00:03:22.709> not<00:03:22.950> just<00:03:23.220> the<00:03:23.340> fuel<00:03:23.580> economy<00:03:24.090> for

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
of the car not just the fuel economy for

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.440 
of the car not just the fuel economy for
example<00:03:25.110> the<00:03:25.200> new<00:03:25.380> lexus<00:03:25.860> LS<00:03:26.280> hybrid<00:03:26.940> flagship

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
example the new lexus LS hybrid flagship

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.110 
example the new lexus LS hybrid flagship
sedan<00:03:27.860> that's<00:03:28.860> a<00:03:29.190> hybrid<00:03:29.580> version<00:03:29.910> of<00:03:30.030> the

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
sedan that's a hybrid version of the

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.699 
sedan that's a hybrid version of the
fanciest<00:03:30.450> lexus<00:03:30.959> and<00:03:31.170> it<00:03:31.410> has<00:03:31.530> more

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
fanciest lexus and it has more

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.550 
fanciest lexus and it has more
horsepower<00:03:31.860> than<00:03:32.220> a<00:03:32.370> Corvette<00:03:32.790> which<00:03:33.120> is

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
horsepower than a Corvette which is

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.720 
horsepower than a Corvette which is
remarkable<00:03:34.560> and<00:03:34.680> that<00:03:35.190> actually<00:03:35.490> actually

one thing I've learned I've been
covering<00:04:01.380> the<00:04:01.560> auto<00:04:01.680> business<00:04:01.890> pretty<00:04:02.340> much

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
covering the auto business pretty much

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.310

my<00:04:02.610> whole<00:04:02.640> life<00:04:02.970> and<00:04:03.300> one<00:04:03.959> thing<00:04:03.989> I've<00:04:04.290> learned

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
my whole life and one thing I've learned

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.190 
my whole life and one thing I've learned
is<00:04:04.680> that<00:04:04.709> any<00:04:05.670> time<00:04:06.060> a<00:04:06.120> car<00:04:06.480> company<00:04:06.720> makes<00:04:07.080> a

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
is that any time a car company makes a

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.990 
is that any time a car company makes a
prediction<00:04:07.380> for<00:04:07.800> technology<00:04:08.400> that<00:04:08.580> is<00:04:08.730> more

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
prediction for technology that is more

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.449 
prediction for technology that is more
than<00:04:09.060> 10<00:04:09.450> years<00:04:09.480> down<00:04:09.870> the<00:04:10.050> road<00:04:10.080> it's<00:04:10.950> just

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
than 10 years down the road it's just

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.240 
than 10 years down the road it's just
pie<00:04:11.820> in<00:04:11.970> the<00:04:12.120> sky<00:04:12.150> they<00:04:12.840> can<00:04:13.050> only<00:04:13.290> be<00:04:13.620> relied

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
pie in the sky they can only be relied

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.830 
pie in the sky they can only be relied
upon<00:04:14.280> to<00:04:14.760> tell<00:04:15.030> you<00:04:15.150> what's<00:04:15.330> going<00:04:15.450> to<00:04:15.510> happen

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
upon to tell you what's going to happen

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.470 
upon to tell you what's going to happen
in<00:04:15.959> five<00:04:16.260> years<00:04:16.590> and<00:04:16.650> maybe

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:17.480 
in five years and maybe

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.160 
in five years and maybe
in<00:04:17.540> 10<00:04:17.810> years<00:04:17.840> so<00:04:18.380> in<00:04:18.920> 20<00:04:19.190> years<00:04:19.520> I<00:04:19.760> don't<00:04:20.060> know

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.170 
in 10 years so in 20 years I don't know

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:23.500 
in 10 years so in 20 years I don't know
crazy<00:04:21.170> like<00:04:21.500> solar<00:04:21.920> powered<00:04:22.520> gas<00:04:22.970> hydrogen

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
crazy like solar powered gas hydrogen

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.660 
crazy like solar powered gas hydrogen
electric<00:04:24.140> hybrids<00:04:24.920> could<00:04:25.160> be<00:04:25.250> on<00:04:25.370> the<00:04:25.490> road

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:25.670 
electric hybrids could be on the road

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:29.410 
electric hybrids could be on the road
but<00:04:26.090> I<00:04:26.890> I<00:04:27.890> wouldn't<00:04:28.400> believe<00:04:28.610> what<00:04:28.880> any<00:04:29.120> car

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.420 
but I I wouldn't believe what any car

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
what cars are going to look like in 20

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.940 
what cars are going to look like in 20
okay<00:04:32.180> so<00:04:32.240> you<00:04:32.420> so<00:04:32.780> you<00:04:32.840> won't<00:04:33.050> be<00:04:33.350> driving<00:04:33.500> safe
