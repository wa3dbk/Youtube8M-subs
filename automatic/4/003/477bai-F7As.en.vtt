doesn't want me using this knife for
that<00:02:12.490> purpose<00:02:13.030> but<00:02:14.160> I'm<00:02:15.160> gonna<00:02:15.370> do<00:02:15.489> it<00:02:15.610> anyways

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.729 

you<00:02:28.580> asked<00:02:28.879> a<00:02:28.909> little<00:02:29.000> bit<00:02:29.239> of<00:02:29.330> natural

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
you asked a little bit of natural

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:39.130 
you asked a little bit of natural
vanilla<00:02:31.209> now<00:02:32.209> we're<00:02:32.390> gonna<00:02:32.480> blend<00:02:32.659> it<00:02:38.140> so

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
vanilla now we're gonna blend it so

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.690 
vanilla now we're gonna blend it so
we've<00:02:39.260> got<00:02:39.379> a<00:02:39.409> portion<00:02:39.890> note<00:02:40.040> in<00:02:40.280> the<00:02:40.459> bowls

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
we've got a portion note in the bowls

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:46.690 
we've got a portion note in the bowls
and<00:02:41.920> this<00:02:42.920> is<00:02:43.099> a<00:02:43.129> really<00:02:43.730> healthy<00:02:45.549> pudding<00:02:46.549> I

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
and this is a really healthy pudding I

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.670 
and this is a really healthy pudding I
guess<00:02:47.629> is<00:02:47.810> quite<00:02:48.019> contradictory<00:02:48.379> because

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
guess is quite contradictory because

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.740 
guess is quite contradictory because
usually<00:02:48.950> pudding<00:02:49.400> is<00:02:49.489> not<00:02:49.670> healthy<00:02:50.060> mm-hmm

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
usually pudding is not healthy mm-hmm

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.839 
usually pudding is not healthy mm-hmm
but<00:02:51.019> it's<00:02:51.170> because<00:02:51.500> of<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:51.650> the<00:02:52.160> chia<00:02:52.459> Chi<00:02:52.760> is

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849 
but it's because of the the chia Chi is

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:56.559 
but it's because of the the chia Chi is
super<00:02:53.209> high<00:02:53.420> in<00:02:53.780> omegas<00:02:55.090> it's<00:02:56.090> actually<00:02:56.420> one

00:02:56.559 --> 00:02:56.569 
super high in omegas it's actually one

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:58.770 
super high in omegas it's actually one
