00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:51.669 
gameplays but he literally is like a

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:53.490 
gameplays but he literally is like a
one-man<00:04:52.000> spawn<00:04:52.540> trap<00:04:52.840> half<00:04:53.050> these<00:04:53.200> people

one-man spawn trap half these people

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.110 
one-man spawn trap half these people
don't<00:04:53.560> even<00:04:53.680> have<00:04:53.800> a<00:04:53.889> chance<00:04:54.070> to<00:04:54.280> move<00:04:54.490> and

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
don't even have a chance to move and

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.550 
don't even have a chance to move and
he's<00:04:55.240> mowing<00:04:55.510> them<00:04:55.720> over<00:04:55.930> as<00:04:56.050> kill<00:04:56.290> streaks

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:56.560
