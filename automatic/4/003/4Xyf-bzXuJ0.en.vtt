 world loves and it's super heavy

 Sometimes people are empty after 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.820
 eating the other one creates lots of olive oil 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.910
 I will not teach you the lesson, but watch is 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:30.420
 a super easy recipe that goes next 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.149

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.320
 dehydrated basil and onion 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.730
 you think 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.290
 in that part of the seasonings a 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.450
 supermarket that is all hanging 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.309
 I give those little bags there. 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.500
 JeitÃ£o hydrated and has also 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.890
 symbol of hydration and a pinch of 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.410
 salt beats everything in the blender capped 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.600

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.460

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.340

 weeks a month will be cool and that's where 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.420

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.299
 which is the traditional way of how 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.299

 15 minutes for the crispy 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.390
 another cool thing I also think it's a 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.729
 green salad lettuce them green leaves 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.530

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.110
