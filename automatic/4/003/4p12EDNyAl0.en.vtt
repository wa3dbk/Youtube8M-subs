00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:47.370 
Carmichael because he's had a few weeks

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:49.850 
Carmichael because he's had a few weeks
off<00:06:47.550> here<00:06:47.759> in<00:06:47.879> there<00:06:48.229> yeah<00:06:49.229> he<00:06:49.409> has<00:06:49.529> taken<00:06:49.830> some

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:49.860 
off here in there yeah he has taken some

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:51.679 
off here in there yeah he has taken some
time<00:06:50.009> off<00:06:50.189> at<00:06:50.580> Colorado<00:06:51.029> last<00:06:51.300> weekend<00:06:51.659> I

00:06:51.679 --> 00:06:51.689 
time off at Colorado last weekend I

00:06:51.689 --> 00:06:53.510 
time off at Colorado last weekend I
think<00:06:51.719> he<00:06:51.930> was<00:06:52.050> definitely<00:06:52.279> sort<00:06:53.279> of<00:06:53.340> blowing

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:53.520 
think he was definitely sort of blowing

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.760 
think he was definitely sort of blowing
the<00:06:53.639> cobwebs<00:06:54.060> off<00:06:54.270> and<00:06:54.539> he's<00:06:55.319> obviously<00:06:55.499> a

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:55.770 
the cobwebs off and he's obviously a

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:57.290 
the cobwebs off and he's obviously a
little<00:06:55.949> bit<00:06:56.039> better<00:06:56.189> here<00:06:56.550> and<00:06:56.669> I<00:06:56.969> think<00:06:57.029> as

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:57.300 
little bit better here and I think as

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:58.790 
little bit better here and I think as
the<00:06:57.389> season<00:06:57.719> goes<00:06:57.960> on<00:06:58.169> in<00:06:58.259> these<00:06:58.349> last<00:06:58.560> four

00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:58.800 
the season goes on in these last four

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.980 
the season goes on in these last four
races<00:06:59.189> it<00:07:00.060> get<00:07:00.180> even<00:07:00.270> better<00:07:00.509> and<00:07:00.689> even<00:07:00.870> better

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:00.990 
races it get even better and even better
