00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
offensive line that it's probably one of

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.720 
you know get you know put them in more
one-on-one<00:02:46.049> situations<00:02:46.709> and<00:02:46.860> they'll

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
one-on-one situations and they'll

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.670 
one-on-one situations and they'll
probably<00:02:48.030> have<00:02:48.180> better<00:02:48.420> opportunities<00:02:48.720> but

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
probably have better opportunities but

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.680 
probably have better opportunities but
it<00:02:49.769> works<00:02:49.920> hand-in-hand<00:02:50.250> you<00:02:50.760> know<00:02:50.880> the

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
it works hand-in-hand you know the

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.229 
it works hand-in-hand you know the
better<00:02:51.870> i'm<00:02:52.079> doing<00:02:52.610> the<00:02:53.610> better<00:02:53.760> they'll<00:02:54.000> do

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
better i'm doing the better they'll do

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.690 
better i'm doing the better they'll do
and<00:02:54.480> vice<00:02:54.870> versa<00:02:55.140> so<00:02:55.590> we're<00:02:56.190> looking<00:02:56.430> forward

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
and vice versa so we're looking forward

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.729
