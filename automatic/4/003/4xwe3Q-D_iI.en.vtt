dedicated geocaching application for the
Mac<00:00:11.160> it's<00:00:12.150> the<00:00:12.840> closest<00:00:13.200> thing<00:00:13.320> to<00:00:13.530> G<00:00:13.710> sack<00:00:13.980> you

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.390 
Mac it's the closest thing to G sack you
can<00:00:14.309> get<00:00:14.460> for<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:14.700> Mac<00:00:14.940> that<00:00:15.240> I've<00:00:15.360> found<00:00:16.400> so

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
can get for the Mac that I've found so

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.189 
can get for the Mac that I've found so
this<00:00:17.699> is<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:17.849> interface<00:00:18.150> I<00:00:18.539> just<00:00:18.989> what<00:00:19.079> you

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
automatically creates the folder for

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.469 
automatically creates the folder for
them<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:58.829> put<00:01:59.159> some<00:01:59.310> all<00:01:59.460> in<00:01:59.609> it<00:01:59.729> which<00:02:00.329> is

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
them and put some all in it which is

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.770 
them and put some all in it which is
very<00:02:00.750> helpful<00:02:01.670> ok<00:02:02.670> then<00:02:02.850> under<00:02:03.149> folder<00:02:03.359> you've

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
very helpful ok then under folder you've

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.859 
very helpful ok then under folder you've
got<00:02:04.020> smart<00:02:04.500> folders<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.880> now<00:02:06.090> smart<00:02:06.539> folders

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
got smart folders and now smart folders

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.390 
got smart folders and now smart folders
useful<00:02:07.289> they<00:02:07.770> allow<00:02:07.979> you<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.220> input<00:02:08.580> a<00:02:09.060> certain

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:10.400 
useful they allow you to input a certain

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.540 
useful they allow you to input a certain
criteria<00:02:11.400> for<00:02:12.120> a<00:02:12.150> folder<00:02:12.650> so<00:02:13.650> you<00:02:13.710> can<00:02:14.040> put<00:02:14.280> in

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
criteria for a folder so you can put in

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.270 
criteria for a folder so you can put in
ivan<00:02:14.910> terrain<00:02:15.600> difficulty<00:02:16.200> type<00:02:16.470> etc<00:02:16.770> in

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
ivan terrain difficulty type etc in

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.460 
ivan terrain difficulty type etc in
there<00:02:17.490> and<00:02:17.700> then<00:02:18.600> it<00:02:18.630> will<00:02:18.810> filter<00:02:19.020> them<00:02:19.290> and

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
there and then it will filter them and

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.210 
there and then it will filter them and
put<00:02:19.890> in<00:02:20.010> only<00:02:20.340> those<00:02:20.460> sorts<00:02:21.000> into<00:02:21.360> the<00:02:21.480> folder

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
put in only those sorts into the folder

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.950 
put in only those sorts into the folder
this<00:02:23.220> is<00:02:23.280> particularly<00:02:23.490> useful<00:02:23.760> if<00:02:24.420> you<00:02:24.660> you

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
this is particularly useful if you you

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.080 
this is particularly useful if you you
know<00:02:24.990> like<00:02:25.410> your<00:02:25.590> maltese<00:02:26.010> and<00:02:26.040> want<00:02:26.910> to<00:02:26.940> put

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
know like your maltese and want to put

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.970 
know like your maltese and want to put
them<00:02:27.150> all<00:02:27.300> in<00:02:27.450> there<00:02:27.660> and<00:02:27.870> every<00:02:28.770> time<00:02:28.920> you

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
them all in there and every time you

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.130 
them all in there and every time you
import<00:02:29.490> a<00:02:29.730> pocket<00:02:30.150> query<00:02:30.420> it<00:02:30.630> will<00:02:30.750> put<00:02:30.900> all<00:02:31.110> of

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
import a pocket query it will put all of

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.500 
import a pocket query it will put all of
the<00:02:31.950> ones<00:02:32.130> that<00:02:32.250> match<00:02:32.490> your<00:02:32.640> criteria<00:02:32.700> into

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
the ones that match your criteria into

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.300 
the ones that match your criteria into
the<00:02:33.600> Smart<00:02:33.870> Folder<00:02:34.080> so<00:02:34.710> you<00:02:34.800> can<00:02:34.950> find<00:02:35.190> them

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
the Smart Folder so you can find them

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.990 
the Smart Folder so you can find them
easily<00:02:36.830> so<00:02:37.830> up<00:02:38.100> here<00:02:38.130> you've<00:02:38.430> got<00:02:38.460> your<00:02:38.790> list

easily so up here you've got your list

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.700 
easily so up here you've got your list
of<00:02:39.830> geocaches<00:02:41.210> and<00:02:42.210> here<00:02:42.450> you've<00:02:42.660> got<00:02:42.710> the

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
of geocaches and here you've got the

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.300 
of geocaches and here you've got the
geocaching<00:02:44.630> info<00:02:45.630> so<00:02:46.500> under<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.800> info<00:02:47.100> you've

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
geocaching info so under the info you've

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.570 
geocaching info so under the info you've
got<00:02:47.490> the<00:02:47.640> terrain<00:02:47.910> difficulty<00:02:48.420> container<00:02:48.900> etc

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
got the terrain difficulty container etc

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.950 
got the terrain difficulty container etc
you<00:02:50.580> got<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.790> coordinates<00:02:51.060> and<00:02:51.330> under<00:02:51.840> that

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
you got the coordinates and under that

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.990 
you got the coordinates and under that
you've<00:02:52.170> got<00:02:52.350> correct<00:02:52.680> coordinates<00:02:52.950> where<00:02:53.880> you

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
you've got correct coordinates where you

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.370 
you've got correct coordinates where you
can<00:02:54.180> input<00:02:54.330> your<00:02:54.510> own<00:02:54.690> coordinates<00:02:55.110> this<00:02:55.200> is

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
can input your own coordinates this is

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.960 
can input your own coordinates this is
particularly<00:02:55.860> useful<00:02:56.130> if<00:02:56.520> you're<00:02:56.610> doing<00:02:56.850> a

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
particularly useful if you're doing a

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.390 
particularly useful if you're doing a
lot<00:02:57.090> of<00:02:57.300> mystery<00:02:57.870> caches<00:02:58.110> where<00:02:59.070> you<00:02:59.160> need<00:02:59.280> to

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
lot of mystery caches where you need to

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.460 
lot of mystery caches where you need to
work<00:02:59.820> out<00:02:59.940> the<00:03:00.090> coordinates<00:03:00.300> beforehand<00:03:00.960> you

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
work out the coordinates beforehand you

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:02.810 
work out the coordinates beforehand you
can<00:03:01.560> input<00:03:01.710> the<00:03:01.830> correct<00:03:02.040> coordinates<00:03:02.400> there

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
can input the correct coordinates there

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.880 
can input the correct coordinates there
and<00:03:03.000> then<00:03:03.330> when<00:03:03.450> you<00:03:03.570> export<00:03:04.080> it<00:03:04.350> you<00:03:04.680> can

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
and then when you export it you can

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.950 
and then when you export it you can
select<00:03:05.370> to<00:03:05.640> export<00:03:06.330> the<00:03:06.420> correct<00:03:06.690> coordinates

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 
select to export the correct coordinates

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.280 
select to export the correct coordinates
and<00:03:08.000> so<00:03:09.000> then<00:03:09.150> your<00:03:09.420> GPS<00:03:09.810> will<00:03:09.990> go<00:03:10.080> to<00:03:10.140> the

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
and so then your GPS will go to the

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.020 
and so then your GPS will go to the
correct<00:03:10.470> coordinates<00:03:10.650> not<00:03:11.190> the<00:03:11.610> coordinates

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
correct coordinates not the coordinates

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.110 
correct coordinates not the coordinates
from<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.240> cache<00:03:12.450> page<00:03:12.660> which<00:03:12.930> is<00:03:13.110> very<00:03:13.560> useful

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
from the cache page which is very useful

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.520 
from the cache page which is very useful
you<00:03:15.120> can<00:03:15.270> add<00:03:15.360> notes<00:03:15.600> to<00:03:15.780> your<00:03:15.900> caches<00:03:16.140> if<00:03:16.410> you

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
you can add notes to your caches if you

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.670 
you can add notes to your caches if you
wish<00:03:16.740> to<00:03:16.980> add<00:03:17.190> my<00:03:17.850> appreciation<00:03:18.480> and<00:03:18.690> also<00:03:19.530> you
