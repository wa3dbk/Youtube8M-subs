00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
be really pan aligned not only to look

good<00:00:22.859> for<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.070> review<00:00:23.460> but<00:00:23.670> just<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:23.970> look

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
good for the review but just to look

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.240 
good for the review but just to look
good<00:00:24.269> on<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.810> shelf<00:00:25.080> i<00:00:25.380> started<00:00:26.310> using<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:28.250> thin

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
good on the shelf i started using a thin

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.580 
good on the shelf i started using a thin
sharpie<00:00:29.750> what<00:00:30.750> what<00:00:30.869> I'm<00:00:30.960> finding<00:00:31.199> is<00:00:31.380> it's

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
sharpie what what I'm finding is it's

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.700 
sharpie what what I'm finding is it's
rubbing<00:00:32.009> off<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.219> lot<00:00:32.610> in<00:00:32.880> certain<00:00:33.390> places<00:00:33.710> and

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
rubbing off a lot in certain places and

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.440 
rubbing off a lot in certain places and
I<00:00:34.800> think<00:00:34.980> it's<00:00:35.070> partly<00:00:35.399> because<00:00:35.610> it's<00:00:35.969> a<00:00:36.149> you

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
I think it's partly because it's a you

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.610 
I think it's partly because it's a you
know<00:00:36.540> it's<00:00:36.690> not<00:00:36.780> a<00:00:36.840> good<00:00:37.050> market<00:00:37.469> but<00:00:37.590> also

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
know it's not a good market but also

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.850 
know it's not a good market but also
partly<00:00:38.040> because<00:00:38.750> it<00:00:39.750> can't<00:00:40.230> fit<00:00:40.469> all<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.770> way

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
partly because it can't fit all the way

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.920 
partly because it can't fit all the way
into<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.190> groove<00:00:41.430> that's<00:00:42.180> ested<00:00:42.780> in<00:00:42.809> the

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
into the groove that's ested in the

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.080 
into the groove that's ested in the
plastic<00:00:43.350> and<00:00:44.090> kind<00:00:45.090> of<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.390> sort<00:00:46.200> of<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:47.090> answer

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
plastic and kind of a sort of a answer

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.060 
plastic and kind of a sort of a answer

lining and in fact I think there are
some<00:01:20.759> cases<00:01:20.970> where<00:01:21.180> some<00:01:21.509> people<00:01:21.540> panel<00:01:21.990> line

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
some cases where some people panel line

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.380 
some cases where some people panel line
there<00:01:22.799> too<00:01:23.009> much<00:01:23.250> there's<00:01:23.549> too<00:01:23.820> much<00:01:24.000> panel

to build this and see how it was I say
won't<00:03:04.540> I<00:03:04.720> say<00:03:05.170> that<00:03:05.350> because<00:03:05.500> I<00:03:06.070> got<00:03:06.700> I<00:03:06.730> got

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
won't I say that because I got I got

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.729 
won't I say that because I got I got
three<00:03:07.570> perfect<00:03:07.930> way<00:03:07.989> kits<00:03:08.230> that<00:03:08.350> are<00:03:08.440> waiting

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
three perfect way kits that are waiting

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:10.500 
three perfect way kits that are waiting
to<00:03:08.800> be<00:03:08.890> built<00:03:09.100> sometime<00:03:09.760> in<00:03:09.970> the<00:03:10.030> future<00:03:10.120> so

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
to be built sometime in the future so

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.470 
to be built sometime in the future so
there's<00:03:11.459> there's<00:03:12.459> not<00:03:12.730> likelihood<00:03:13.270> that<00:03:13.300> i'll

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
there's there's not likelihood that i'll

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.330 
there's there's not likelihood that i'll
get<00:03:13.660> this<00:03:13.840> especially<00:03:14.410> that<00:03:14.440> it's<00:03:14.680> also<00:03:15.100> the

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
get this especially that it's also the

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.550 
get this especially that it's also the
fact<00:03:15.489> that<00:03:15.610> it's<00:03:15.790> you<00:03:15.880> know<00:03:16.050> close<00:03:17.050> to<00:03:17.200> 300

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
fact that it's you know close to 300

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.789 
fact that it's you know close to 300
bucks<00:03:17.769> for<00:03:18.070> the<00:03:18.130> perfect<00:03:18.400> rage<00:03:18.519> so<00:03:19.049> i<00:03:20.049> think<00:03:20.620> i

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
bucks for the perfect rage so i think i

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:22.650 
bucks for the perfect rage so i think i
could<00:03:20.860> get<00:03:21.010> this<00:03:21.220> try<00:03:21.459> it<00:03:21.519> out<00:03:21.700> and<00:03:21.850> see<00:03:21.940> how<00:03:22.630> i

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
could get this try it out and see how i

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.390 
could get this try it out and see how i
like<00:03:22.959> it<00:03:22.989> and<00:03:23.290> and<00:03:24.150> go<00:03:25.150> from<00:03:25.299> there<00:03:26.160> so<00:03:27.160> that's

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
like it and and go from there so that's

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.930 
like it and and go from there so that's
