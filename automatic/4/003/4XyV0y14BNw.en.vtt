00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.080
 worth noting the bet on the strategy 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.870
 commercial 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.790
 the model goes with the old price and 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.940
 has a discount action for those who 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.850

 the first three months after the 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:48.390
 ford guarantees 15% discount for those who 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:51.570
 change a 2015 focus by model zero 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.420
 This means that the version s 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:01:00.980
 and which costs 69 thousand nine hundred reais 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.980
 can leave for only 59 thousand 415 reais 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.880
 among the news the first change 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.850
 is in the configuration of the finished versions 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.979
 the version if a focus with engine 1.6 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.530
 no longer offers the broadcast 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.650
 automated dual powershift 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.960
 clutch then on the visual is in front 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.479
 where are the biggest changes with 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.390
 new grille with narrower headlights and 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.560
 daytime running lights on the rear almost 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.049
 all the same 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.180
 except for details in the for shock in the 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.420
 design of the trunk lid and the 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.420
 lanterns 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.010
 inside little has changed with 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.440
 highlight the new design of 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.820
 the multifunction steering wheel and the 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.190
 air conditioning 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.190
 The same packages are interesting. 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:58.710
 security connectivity than in the 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.080
 top the model won the second generation 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.060
 parking assistant 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.850
 now allows maneuvering vacancies 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.640
 perpendicular and the good 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.950
 braking that can even stop the 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.820
 car in case of collision risk with 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.820
 another vehicle ahead 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:23.400
 but the biggest strategy of this new focus 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.010
 was to raise the level without charging more 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.950
 so it is true that the new 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.260
 entry version if already well equipped 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.890

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.060
 stability and traction controls 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:42.470
 disc brakes on all four wheels are 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.470
 all standard items
