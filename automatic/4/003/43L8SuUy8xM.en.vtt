00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
song itself is by an artist by the name

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.229 
song itself is by an artist by the name
of<00:00:42.780> Aisha<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.590> features<00:00:44.040> chin<00:00:44.370> on<00:00:44.520> which<00:00:44.789> I'm

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
of Aisha and features chin on which I'm

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.060 
of Aisha and features chin on which I'm
guessing<00:00:45.750> is<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.170> rapping<00:00:46.559> portion<00:00:46.890> of<00:00:46.980> the

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
guessing is the rapping portion of the

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.560 
guessing is the rapping portion of the
song<00:00:47.250> I'm<00:00:47.430> not<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:47.610> hundred<00:00:47.789> percent<00:00:47.969> on<00:00:48.390> this

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
song I'm not a hundred percent on this

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.900 
song I'm not a hundred percent on this
um<00:00:48.780> but<00:00:49.680> you<00:00:50.129> know<00:00:50.160> I<00:00:50.250> don't<00:00:50.460> speak<00:00:50.730> Japanese

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
um but you know I don't speak Japanese

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.459 
um but you know I don't speak Japanese
so<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:51.360> don't<00:00:51.480> really<00:00:51.570> understand<00:00:52.079> what<00:00:52.350> the

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
so I don't really understand what the

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:53.569 
so I don't really understand what the
song<00:00:52.649> is<00:00:52.680> about<00:00:52.829> but<00:00:53.190> from<00:00:53.340> what<00:00:53.430> I've

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
song is about but from what I've

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.529 
song is about but from what I've
gathered<00:00:54.030> it<00:00:54.809> seems<00:00:55.170> very<00:00:56.000> light-hearted<00:00:57.000> and

well-known characters and then at the

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.570 
well-known characters and then at the
end<00:02:06.990> they<00:02:07.259> start<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.649> focus<00:02:07.860> on<00:02:08.160> some<00:02:08.369> random

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
end they start to focus on some random

who<00:02:10.649> they<00:02:10.800> are<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:11.280> then<00:02:11.640> they

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
who they are and then they

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.830 
who they are and then they
including<00:02:12.340> filler<00:02:12.670> characters<00:02:13.150> like<00:02:13.300> Matsuri

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
and oddly enough at the end it actually

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.339 
and oddly enough at the end it actually
ends<00:02:17.170> with<00:02:17.319> just<00:02:17.500> some<00:02:17.650> random<00:02:17.980> cloud<00:02:18.519> ninja

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:34.770 
the entire ending itself and then at the
very<00:02:33.580> end<00:02:33.849> like<00:02:34.060> I<00:02:34.150> said<00:02:34.360> when<00:02:34.540> they<00:02:34.630> show<00:02:34.750> that

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
actual butterfly lands on his headband

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.250 
actual butterfly lands on his headband
and<00:02:40.120> I<00:02:40.269> don't<00:02:40.450> know<00:02:40.510> I'm<00:02:40.750> sure<00:02:40.780> there's<00:02:41.110> some

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
and I don't know I'm sure there's some

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.600 
and I don't know I'm sure there's some
imagery<00:02:41.620> here<00:02:41.830> that<00:02:41.980> I'm<00:02:42.069> not<00:02:42.190> quite<00:02:42.430> getting

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
imagery here that I'm not quite getting

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.160 
imagery here that I'm not quite getting
maybe<00:02:43.150> something<00:02:43.540> that<00:02:43.660> has<00:02:43.750> to<00:02:43.900> do<00:02:44.019> the

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
maybe something that has to do the

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.860 
maybe something that has to do the
lyrics<00:02:44.530> but<00:02:45.250> you<00:02:45.640> know<00:02:45.760> I<00:02:45.970> definitely<00:02:46.420> enjoyed

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
lyrics but you know I definitely enjoyed

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.080 
lyrics but you know I definitely enjoyed
the<00:02:47.049> last<00:02:47.230> ending<00:02:47.680> a<00:02:47.799> lot<00:02:48.010> but<00:02:48.580> this<00:02:48.670> ending<00:02:49.000> is

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
the last ending a lot but this ending is

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.400 
the last ending a lot but this ending is
still<00:02:49.299> really<00:02:49.540> good<00:02:49.599> it's<00:02:49.930> really<00:02:49.989> well<00:02:50.380> done

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
still really good it's really well done

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.949 
still really good it's really well done
it's<00:02:50.769> really<00:02:51.340> well<00:02:51.489> animated<00:02:51.880> the<00:02:52.750> song

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
it's really well animated the song

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.270 
it's really well animated the song
itself<00:02:53.110> I'm<00:02:53.530> very<00:02:53.560> indifferent<00:02:54.040> about

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
itself I'm very indifferent about

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.370 
itself I'm very indifferent about
because<00:02:54.730> you<00:02:54.970> know<00:02:55.090> it's<00:02:55.269> just<00:02:55.329> it's<00:02:55.720> Japanese

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
because you know it's just it's Japanese
