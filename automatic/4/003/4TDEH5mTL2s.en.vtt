battlefield than it was having none of
it<00:02:00.030> was<00:02:00.149> like<00:02:00.329> no<00:02:00.509> it<00:02:00.750> won't<00:02:01.049> register<00:02:01.200> in<00:02:01.530> that

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
it was like no it won't register in that

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.490 
it was like no it won't register in that
screen<00:02:01.979> at<00:02:02.219> all<00:02:02.369> so<00:02:02.790> basically<00:02:03.689> I<00:02:04.020> couldn't

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
screen at all so basically I couldn't

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.410 
screen at all so basically I couldn't
even<00:02:04.680> get<00:02:04.799> on<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:05.070> change<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.520> settings<00:02:05.880> so<00:02:06.390> I

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
even get on to change the settings so I

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.150 
even get on to change the settings so I
did<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.659> lot<00:02:06.750> of<00:02:06.810> scouring<00:02:07.259> for<00:02:07.350> this<00:02:07.619> I<00:02:07.799> think

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
did a lot of scouring for this I think

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.369 
did a lot of scouring for this I think
this<00:02:08.250> is<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:08.429> fantastic<00:02:08.700> tool<00:02:09.360> it's<00:02:09.690> like<00:02:10.110> about

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
this is a fantastic tool it's like about

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.140 
this is a fantastic tool it's like about
20<00:02:10.830> megabytes<00:02:11.250> so<00:02:11.879> if<00:02:11.970> you've<00:02:12.120> got

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150
