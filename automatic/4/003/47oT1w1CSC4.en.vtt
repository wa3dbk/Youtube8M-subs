figured<00:01:27.140> this<00:01:27.289> was<00:01:27.470> an<00:01:27.649> easy<00:01:27.920> way<00:01:28.310> and<00:01:29.179> I<00:01:29.720> I'm

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
figured this was an easy way and I I'm

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.820 
figured this was an easy way and I I'm
currently<00:01:30.800> using<00:01:30.979> a<00:01:31.720> obviously<00:01:32.720> if<00:01:32.959> the<00:01:33.440> one

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
currently using a obviously if the one

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.570 
currently using a obviously if the one
number<00:01:34.190> one<00:01:34.490> is<00:01:34.729> PowerPoint<00:01:35.770> and<00:01:36.770> then<00:01:37.009> number

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
number one is PowerPoint and then number

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.199 
number one is PowerPoint and then number
two<00:01:38.030> would<00:01:38.390> be<00:01:38.860> Movie<00:01:39.860> Maker<00:01:40.009> and<00:01:40.429> I<00:01:40.849> would

00:01:41.199 --> 00:01:41.209 
two would be Movie Maker and I would

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:45.040 
two would be Movie Maker and I would
normally<00:01:41.390> do<00:01:42.080> this<00:01:42.259> with<00:01:42.770> a<00:01:43.630> Camtasia<00:01:44.630> but

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.050 
normally do this with a Camtasia but

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.589 
normally do this with a Camtasia but
Movie<00:01:45.800> Maker<00:01:45.950> is<00:01:46.190> I'm<00:01:46.940> actually<00:01:47.179> recording
