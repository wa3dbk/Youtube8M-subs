00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.310 

most<00:01:29.399> recently<00:01:29.939> I<00:01:30.210> worked<00:01:30.509> in<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:30.780> drama<00:01:31.020> which

00:01:36.169 --> 00:01:36.179 
sort of cut the stuff that was being

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:38.600 
sort of cut the stuff that was being
filmed<00:01:36.539> on<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.020> day<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.469> then<00:01:38.219> show<00:01:38.429> it<00:01:38.460> to

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.730 
filmed on the day and then show it to
them<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.789> night<00:01:39.140> pretty<00:01:40.140> much<00:01:40.229> straight<00:01:40.560> away

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
them a night pretty much straight away

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.919 
them a night pretty much straight away
you<00:01:41.610> spot<00:01:41.909> that<00:01:42.179> there's<00:01:42.360> bits<00:01:42.569> of<00:01:42.659> script

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:42.929 
you spot that there's bits of script

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:43.609 
you spot that there's bits of script
don't<00:01:43.110> need<00:01:43.259> anymore

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
don't need anymore

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.319 
don't need anymore
you<00:01:43.859> spot<00:01:44.189> that<00:01:44.399> some<00:01:44.579> scenes<00:01:44.819> are<00:01:44.969> too<00:01:45.149> long

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
you spot that some scenes are too long

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.419 
you spot that some scenes are too long
it<00:01:45.509> can<00:01:45.600> be<00:01:45.689> cut<00:01:45.929> down<00:01:46.200> it<00:01:46.710> actually<00:01:46.860> ends<00:01:47.340> up

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:47.429 
it can be cut down it actually ends up

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:48.980 
it can be cut down it actually ends up
making<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.850> entire<00:01:48.149> filmmaking<00:01:48.689> process

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
making the entire filmmaking process

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.209 
making the entire filmmaking process
more<00:01:49.950> effective<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:50.729> better<00:01:51.209> value<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:52.219> think

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:53.219 
more effective and better value I think

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:55.699 
more effective and better value I think
at<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.549> moment<00:01:53.579> it's<00:01:54.000> almost<00:01:54.270> as<00:01:54.479> if<00:01:54.709> right

00:01:55.699 --> 00:01:55.709 
at the moment it's almost as if right

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:57.289 
at the moment it's almost as if right
across<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.069> industry<00:01:56.579> right<00:01:56.909> across<00:01:57.090> the

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
across the industry right across the

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
is there really really this new way of

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.969 
is there really really this new way of
doing<00:02:06.030> things<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.780> don't<00:02:06.929> think<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.530> BBC<00:02:07.920> is

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
doing things I don't think the BBC is

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.380 
doing things I don't think the BBC is
unique<00:02:08.310> in<00:02:08.519> the<00:02:08.610> challenges<00:02:09.090> that<00:02:09.239> we're

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
unique in the challenges that we're

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.449 
unique in the challenges that we're
facing<00:02:09.420> it's<00:02:10.079> really<00:02:10.380> an<00:02:10.470> industry<00:02:10.979> thing<00:02:11.220> I

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
facing it's really an industry thing I

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.509 
facing it's really an industry thing I
think<00:02:12.180> third<00:02:12.360> there<00:02:12.630> are<00:02:12.860> other<00:02:13.860> broadcasters

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
think third there are other broadcasters

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:16.550 
think third there are other broadcasters
that<00:02:14.630> you<00:02:15.630> know<00:02:15.720> aren't<00:02:15.930> willing<00:02:16.260> to<00:02:16.410> take

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
that you know aren't willing to take

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.710 
that you know aren't willing to take
risk<00:02:16.860> and<00:02:17.099> I<00:02:17.220> can<00:02:17.370> understand<00:02:17.819> that<00:02:17.910> but

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
risk and I can understand that but

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.120 
risk and I can understand that but
within<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:19.019> BBC<00:02:19.410> we<00:02:19.530> have<00:02:19.650> a<00:02:19.680> remit<00:02:20.010> to

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
within the BBC we have a remit to

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.880 
within the BBC we have a remit to
innovate<00:02:20.459> as<00:02:20.670> well<00:02:20.880> so<00:02:21.750> part<00:02:22.590> of<00:02:22.709> our

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
innovate as well so part of our

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.400 
innovate as well so part of our
objective<00:02:23.370> and<00:02:24.060> how<00:02:24.480> we<00:02:24.540> use<00:02:24.780> technology<00:02:24.810> is

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
objective and how we use technology is

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.890 
objective and how we use technology is
to<00:02:25.590> try<00:02:25.739> and<00:02:25.860> push<00:02:26.040> some<00:02:26.220> of<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.370> boundaries

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
to try and push some of the boundaries

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.460 
to try and push some of the boundaries
normally<00:02:27.900> when<00:02:28.019> you're<00:02:28.110> trying<00:02:28.230> to<00:02:28.349> be<00:02:28.440> a

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
pioneer it involves you're taking a huge

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.240 
pioneer it involves you're taking a huge
risk<00:02:32.220> with<00:02:32.459> money<00:02:32.790> but<00:02:33.450> here<00:02:33.900> that<00:02:34.250> the

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
risk with money but here that the

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.160 
risk with money but here that the
opportunity<00:02:35.819> to<00:02:36.359> be<00:02:36.480> pioneers<00:02:36.870> at<00:02:36.959> something

opportunity to be pioneers at something

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.920 
opportunity to be pioneers at something
that<00:02:37.230> actually<00:02:37.410> is<00:02:37.799> not<00:02:38.459> only<00:02:38.850> better<00:02:39.090> but

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
that actually is not only better but

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.650 
that actually is not only better but
it's<00:02:40.079> actually<00:02:40.319> lower<00:02:40.650> cost<00:02:41.299> so<00:02:42.299> why<00:02:42.450> wouldn't

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
it's actually lower cost so why wouldn't

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.569 
it's actually lower cost so why wouldn't
