00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.540
 hello visitors alive 5 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.490
 This is the third part of the video courses that I 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.090
 I will continue to talk about how to remove 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.340
 stop motion 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.440
 in this part we will finally take off our 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.450
 own stop motion video but 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.310
 first we need to prepare to make 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.349
 the fact that your battery is a camera 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.439
 charged one hundred percent a memory card 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:24.000
 empty next stop motion people video i 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.369
 I will shoot in the room so here 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.349
 a lot depends on the lighting now 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.180
 is the case nearing sunset therefore 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.910
 I decided for what out of the window and turn on the light 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.950
 since the light drop will be negative 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.960
 affect the picture and small 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.850
 cut on this if you are well able to 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.950
 take a picture try to indulge 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.840
 with manual settings can be done about 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.670
 very unusual effects for example 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.650
 using long exposure is quite 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.690
 really take off good stop motion at night 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.040
 up many tricks and effects yourself 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.990
 guess in the process of shooting 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.940
 well let's take off now and 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.590
 actually so much of your video in 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.079
 as a springboard and decided to use 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.050
 your desktop as objects 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.379
 video coin the essence of the video 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.880
 coins pop up in frame and out of them 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.220
 there is a little man who will 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.220
 wave your hand 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:13.380
 tripod camera I set them so 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.450
 so that it is not convenient to take and 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.600
 there was no moving around the room 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.000
 nothing extra to camera every 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.830
 since I focused when shooting I changed 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.020
 position is remarkable on the lens 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.020
 from autofocus mode manual focus 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.930
 after each frame of the concept will 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.740
 advance a short distance to 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.740
 achieve smoothness 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.840
 how do you shoot the stop motion 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.250
 this hard monotonous work 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.700
 requiring very high concentration and 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.770
 attention during shooting can we clear 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.390
 representation of where on next 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.970
 the frame will be moving the hey object 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.700
 one spoiled frame can spoil 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.890
 the whole movie here is a picture I watch 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.940
 on the screen of your camera if not 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.490
 used the increase 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.500
 then the coins would be very small and for 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.910
 order to move their cockroach prices i 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.910
 it would take a lot of work 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.040
 in the end to take this one off 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.370
 video I took about 13 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.370
 minutes 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.170
 so I took off my stop left in the end 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:43.750
 I got 95 frames next 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:47.940
 parts of the video lessons I will tell you how 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.940
 glue and get ready video
