00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.239
 I'll tell you honestly, because I donâ€™t 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.219
 held back as soon as I bought it came 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.609
 and started reading because I wanted to know 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.500
 sentence of the first part and necessarily 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.909

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.220
 Myth also 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.229

 I really want to buy 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.439
 and immediately comb the two parts as you can 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.080
 quicker to know what will happen next 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:25.979
 that the second part of the cycle 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:28.799

 book a sezann and kesley forgotten story 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:38.369
 love for a dollar of two hearts in general is 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.900
 far from romance this i wouldn't buy 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.590
 just an ordinary love affair 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:46.170
 Describes descriptiveness here 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.270
 which goes to scotland as far as 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.790
 were maidan in scotland she is fascinated 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.670

 which she settles and she is there 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:00.200
 begins writing a novel by a pharmacy girl 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.200
 who used to live here and 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:06.190
 after some time she realizes that 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.259
 this line that separates it and this 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:12.400
 the heroine who lived here for many centuries 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:14.170
 back she is erased and she understand that 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.050
 maybe this girl existed on 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:20.140
 in fact everything is really very 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:22.060
 mysteriously 10 on covered in darkness can 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:27.040
 mysterious novel is very interesting 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:29.800
 which binds both our time and the distant 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.510
 In general, I was very interesting 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.970
 connect this book so i'm here 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.100

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.680
 read because the plot is pretty 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.570
 interesting and not ban ali so i bought 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.560
 this book with the hope that it is me something 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:47.160
 surprise and + design insanely insane 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.590
 I liked the same beautiful bright 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:53.950
 nice design even the next book 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.140
 this is my beautiful misfortune jamie 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:59.290
 McGwire cat I already bought in print 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.300
 option since i taught about electronic and 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.250
 The printed moment should be because I 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.320
 I love and reread very often 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.120
 so decided to buy printed or 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.870
 judging rules like this but the red 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.890
 the fall 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:15.750

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:23.799
 my walking misfortune the second part 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:27.370
 the giving book is one of the series also 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:31.390
 I gave here such a book that 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.950
 called sorcery war and the first 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.640
 part this is the first part is called 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:39.519
 unbreakable oath 2 o'clock, too, came out 3 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:42.310
 still in my only spelled in general, this 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:43.690
 the book I killed them transports because not 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.880
 liked the design 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.410
 although I do not like to here from the eye 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:49.700
 somewhat frightening slightly 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.349
 but the books themselves 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.450
 design yourself liked the fact that such 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:57.790
 she is firm she is bright she is so 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:59.860
 colorful and I read from behind the design 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:03.379
 content of this book 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:06.680
 Here we told the girls 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:08.720

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.390
 attracted 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:16.220

 so new in the world i gave 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:34.460
 although the book is not new in my opinion 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:36.770
 2010 2 parts of 2011 and in my opinion came out 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:40.610
