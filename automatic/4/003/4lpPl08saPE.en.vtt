converted to a striker this guy was
pretty<00:02:02.040> damn<00:02:02.250> surprising<00:02:02.909> now<00:02:03.360> he<00:02:03.420> is<00:02:03.750> not

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
pretty damn surprising now he is not

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.130 
pretty damn surprising now he is not
perfect<00:02:04.590> shooting<00:02:05.490> with<00:02:05.640> him<00:02:05.759> is<00:02:05.969> really

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
perfect shooting with him is really

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.010 
perfect shooting with him is really
because<00:02:07.649> his<00:02:08.459> shorty<00:02:09.030> shop<00:02:09.300> how<00:02:09.420> isn't<00:02:09.720> it

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
because his shorty shop how isn't it

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.690 
because his shorty shop how isn't it
isn't<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.709> greatest<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:11.310> at<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.489> same<00:02:11.640> time

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
isn't the greatest and at the same time

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.610 
isn't the greatest and at the same time
long<00:02:12.150> shots<00:02:12.420> was<00:02:12.660> pretty<00:02:12.930> bad

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
long shots was pretty bad

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.960 
long shots was pretty bad
I think<00:02:13.890> his<00:02:14.069> long<00:02:14.310> shots<00:02:14.549> that<00:02:14.730> is<00:02:14.819> like

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
I think his long shots that is like

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.729 
I think his long shots that is like
somewhere<00:02:15.330> in<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.540> 70<00:02:16.080> I<00:02:16.200> think<00:02:16.470> it<00:02:16.560> was<00:02:16.650> like

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
somewhere in the 70 I think it was like

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.820 
somewhere in the 70 I think it was like
70<00:02:17.250> or<00:02:17.370> 71<00:02:17.819> so<00:02:18.540> pretty<00:02:18.900> damn<00:02:19.349> and<00:02:19.590> let's

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
70 or 71 so pretty damn and let's

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.229 
70 or 71 so pretty damn and let's
just<00:02:19.980> say<00:02:20.190> the<00:02:20.459> only<00:02:20.610> way<00:02:20.849> you're<00:02:21.030> going<00:02:21.150> to

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239 
just say the only way you're going to

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.089 
just say the only way you're going to
school<00:02:21.450> with<00:02:21.659> him<00:02:21.840> issuing<00:02:22.500> in<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.769> penalty

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
school with him issuing in the penalty

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.670 
school with him issuing in the penalty
area<00:02:23.280> now<00:02:24.060> from<00:02:24.390> long<00:02:24.569> distance<00:02:25.049> I<00:02:25.319> think

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
area now from long distance I think

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.380 
area now from long distance I think
finesse<00:02:26.129> shots<00:02:26.370> are<00:02:26.549> the<00:02:26.700> only<00:02:26.819> option<00:02:27.239> with

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
finesse shots are the only option with

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.789 
finesse shots are the only option with
Griezmann<00:02:27.780> if<00:02:27.900> you<00:02:28.019> want<00:02:28.140> to<00:02:28.230> score<00:02:28.379> from<00:02:28.560> long

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:28.799 
Griezmann if you want to score from long

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:30.710 
Griezmann if you want to score from long
distance<00:02:29.250> because<00:02:29.610> he<00:02:30.090> has<00:02:30.209> some<00:02:30.450> pretty

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
distance because he has some pretty

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.470 
distance because he has some pretty
awesome<00:02:31.049> finish<00:02:31.470> shots<00:02:31.860> but<00:02:32.430> do<00:02:32.970> not<00:02:33.150> bother

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
awesome finish shots but do not bother

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.270 
awesome finish shots but do not bother
shooting<00:02:34.110> outside<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.560> penalty<00:02:34.680> area<00:02:34.920> with

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
shooting outside the penalty area with

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.369 
shooting outside the penalty area with
this<00:02:35.459> guy<00:02:35.670> because<00:02:36.239> I<00:02:36.299> found<00:02:36.540> it<00:02:36.810> pretty<00:02:37.079> bad
