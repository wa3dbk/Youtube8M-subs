00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.580
 hi friends, how are you? 

00:00:02.699 --> 00:00:08.040
 quite good because I bring a 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.800
 application for you that is very very 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.520
 effective is very very good and it is also 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.500
 very efficient 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.300
 it's called laptop and doctor and I'm 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.430
 installing from view the because I've had 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.960
 some problems with the piston however 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.780
 If they want to buy it, it has a price of 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.140
 a dollar is really very economical and what 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.910
 what it does is very very useful since we 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.369
 lengthens the duration of our battery 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.720
 very well already installed the application I'm going 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.850
 to show what their environment would be 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.850
 graphic for that I will leave install 

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:39.440
 Y 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.320
 and I will go to the battery application 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.870
 doctor 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.360
 very good as we can see your surroundings 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:49.239
 graphic is very striking very intuitive and 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.640
 It is very very easy to use at a glance 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:53.710
 let's see what would be the 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:57.309
 state section and that is here we are going to 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:01:00.820
 can see how our battery is like 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:03.309
 come I have it 100% and the time that 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.170
 we can use it for everything we are going 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.210
 to say how much time remains for us 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.840
 example if I did right now 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.910
 be on the internet via wi-fi tells me 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.640
 that would last me six hours with six 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:18.820
 minutes using it what is a great 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.920
 great time if I'm playing games 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.320
 hundreds of in 3-do listening to music 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.509
 he also tells me his time 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.280
 corresponding very well now as 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:30.940
 can you see what you notice that 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:33.610
 I have 89 percent of battery what 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:35.740
 It would be a bit strange, maybe 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.840
 because as they saw open the program or 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:42.310
 the application and he told me that he had 100% 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.510
 I'm going to modify the brightness 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.760
 so that the image looks a little better 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.820
 and again I apologize for the 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.410
 video quality that I bring you without 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.570
 However, the application is very good and it is 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:59.100
 what is interesting to see on this occasion very 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.680
 yes right now as you can see is us 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.240
 give other options such as tips 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.660
 to see the tips we should only 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.850
 to move sideways by 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.820
 example tells us this is to leave a 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:14.060
 5 full cycle charge forgiveness close 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.620
 applications disable use of schedule 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.080
 disable icloud and many many 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.730
 other things plus those tips some already 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.860
 we knew it, but there are others who 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.090
 they are more useful although in fact it is not very 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.620
 It is necessary for you to follow these 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.630
 advice since what does this 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.440
 program is to manage the processes of 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:33.480
 our device so that the battery lasts 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.550
 more time also tells us what is the 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.040
 battery health as you saw it gives us 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.590
 even very very very good subjects gives us 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:44.459
 colors for the stack and it even gives us 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.740
 textures images or even banners yo 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:50.250
 I'm going to put a color that I like a lot 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:53.310
 and it's blue blue silver or blue 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.860
 and nothing seems to me that it is and there it is as 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.230
 come here tell me that I have 100% of 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.680
 however, if I remove the 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:04.200
 application the battery is going to lower this is 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.510
 because I'm in safe mode or a mode of 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:10.269
 try on my ipod 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.849
 I do not have the multitasking option enabled 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:14.760
 however, if you have the 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:16.930
 activated multitasking option 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.390
 they will automatically see that the battery 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.980
 it stays the same according to what we 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.140
 we are doing as we saw by 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.569
 example being on youtube is how are we going to 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.430
 to be able to organize our battery if I 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:29.140
 I would now watch videos on youtube 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.269
 until the battery will reach 50 per 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.190
 cent and I take it off when I get to 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:37.150
 listen to music the battery will increase 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.609
 at 80 percent and it's amazing 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.019
 really what this application does 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:42.220
 download it so that they see it and already as 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:44.109
 I told you it has a very price 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.000
 economic, for example, in the 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:48.909
 games will change the battery level 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.159
 and it's going to go down, maybe it's going to look like 

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:53.019
 goes down too fast however in 

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:55.389
 when the battery is removed, it will go up 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:57.340
 immediately they will be able to find 

00:03:55.389 --> 00:04:00.489
 in the app store and they just have to 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.989
 look for her as a battery doctor but I do not 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:04.030
 I can currently download from the 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:05.739
 ifpi store therefore I can not 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.139
 show them the download directly 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:10.329
 from here and start the video from 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:12.220
 installed however if only the 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:13.390
 they want to try, they can download a 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.760
 free version 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.040
 the installed version 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.299
 this would be all friends this way 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.729
 you can install the application 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:24.419
 I hope you liked it and see you 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:24.419
 the next
