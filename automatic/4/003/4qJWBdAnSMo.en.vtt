00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
11th you can see jordan gamma blue the

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.539 
11th you can see jordan gamma blue the
gamma<00:01:03.660> blue<00:01:03.870> inside<00:01:04.290> it<00:01:04.920> doesn't<00:01:05.220> really<00:01:05.339> mean

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
gamma blue inside it doesn't really mean

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:06.649 
gamma blue inside it doesn't really mean
they're<00:01:05.729> authentic<00:01:05.970> i'm<00:01:06.270> not<00:01:06.390> sure<00:01:06.510> if<00:01:06.570> you

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
they're authentic i'm not sure if you

this but I'll put it right away so yeah
basically<00:02:33.310> join<00:02:34.310> and<00:02:34.520> gamma<00:02:34.730> blue<00:02:35.080> that<00:02:36.080> I

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
basically join and gamma blue that I

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.910 
basically join and gamma blue that I
folded<00:02:36.740> drank<00:02:37.490> XCOM<00:02:38.350> and<00:02:39.350> I<00:02:39.530> think<00:02:39.709> these<00:02:39.860> are

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
folded drank XCOM and I think these are

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.170 
folded drank XCOM and I think these are
probably<00:02:40.310> the<00:02:40.400> last<00:02:40.610> year's<00:02:40.910> I'm<00:02:41.000> going<00:02:41.120> to
