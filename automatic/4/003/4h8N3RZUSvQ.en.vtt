00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
all right a quick video just showing a

fun<00:00:05.430> I<00:00:05.460> had<00:00:05.730> this<00:00:05.879> weekend<00:00:06.270> there<00:00:07.049> was<00:00:07.109> a<00:00:07.490> thing

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
fun I had this weekend there was a thing

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.209 
fun I had this weekend there was a thing
I'm<00:00:08.610> thinking<00:00:08.970> us<00:00:09.150> by<00:00:09.420> John<00:00:10.099> called<00:00:11.099> the

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
I'm thinking us by John called the

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.289 
I'm thinking us by John called the
vertex<00:00:11.400> belts<00:00:12.090> Trudeau<00:00:12.540> which<00:00:12.719> is<00:00:13.250> his<00:00:14.299> design

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
vertex belts Trudeau which is his design

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.740 
vertex belts Trudeau which is his design
for<00:00:15.690> taking<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.410> extruder<00:00:17.340> motor<00:00:17.609> off<00:00:18.150> the

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
for taking the extruder motor off the

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:19.640 
for taking the extruder motor off the
actual<00:00:19.050> carriage

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
actual carriage

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.859 
actual carriage
now<00:00:20.160> that's<00:00:20.730> one<00:00:21.029> design<00:00:21.330> but<00:00:21.600> in<00:00:21.779> the

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
now that's one design but in the

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.390 
now that's one design but in the
comments<00:00:22.289> Martin<00:00:22.650> Price<00:00:24.289> mentioned<00:00:25.400> an

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
comments Martin Price mentioned an

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.790 
comments Martin Price mentioned an
alternative<00:00:27.029> design<00:00:27.180> which<00:00:27.599> I've<00:00:28.140> mocked<00:00:28.560> up

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
alternative design which I've mocked up

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.009 
alternative design which I've mocked up
here<00:00:29.160> now<00:00:29.429> what<00:00:29.699> I've<00:00:29.820> done<00:00:29.849> is<00:00:30.269> just<00:00:30.869> simply

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
here now what I've done is just simply

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.340 
here now what I've done is just simply
thrown<00:00:31.260> a<00:00:31.349> few<00:00:31.500> things<00:00:31.710> together<00:00:32.180> to<00:00:33.180> show<00:00:33.390> how

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
thrown a few things together to show how

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.840 
thrown a few things together to show how
it<00:00:34.500> would<00:00:34.590> work<00:00:34.620> would<00:00:35.219> also<00:00:35.370> have<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.610> think

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
it would work would also have a think

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.970 
it would work would also have a think
about<00:00:36.030> what<00:00:36.090> needs<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.660> be<00:00:36.840> designed<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.829> what

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
about what needs to be designed and what

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.380 
about what needs to be designed and what
worth<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.540> problems<00:00:39.540> might<00:00:39.719> lay<00:00:39.930> so<00:00:40.530> it's<00:00:40.950> a

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
worth the problems might lay so it's a

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.950 
worth the problems might lay so it's a
Matt<00:00:42.390> Roberts<00:00:43.250> extruder<00:00:44.360> because<00:00:45.360> it's<00:00:45.539> small

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
Matt Roberts extruder because it's small

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.830 
Matt Roberts extruder because it's small
but<00:00:46.530> also<00:00:47.100> very<00:00:47.430> modular<00:00:47.940> so<00:00:48.450> it's<00:00:48.629> easy<00:00:48.750> to

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
but also very modular so it's easy to

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.880 
but also very modular so it's easy to
take<00:00:49.250> take<00:00:50.250> apart<00:00:50.719> and<00:00:51.719> then<00:00:52.079> what<00:00:52.559> we've<00:00:52.710> got

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
take take apart and then what we've got

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.340 
take take apart and then what we've got
here<00:00:53.460> is<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:54.230> NEMA<00:00:55.230> 11<00:00:56.300> stepper<00:00:57.300> motor<00:00:57.539> which<00:00:58.320> is

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
here is a NEMA 11 stepper motor which is

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.619 
here is a NEMA 11 stepper motor which is
the<00:00:59.100> one<00:00:59.640> I<00:01:00.059> believe<00:01:00.329> Adrian<00:01:01.020> Bowyer<00:01:02.629> won't

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
the one I believe Adrian Bowyer won't

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.590 
the one I believe Adrian Bowyer won't
would<00:01:04.260> use<00:01:04.500> in<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.100> mini<00:01:05.939> extruder<00:01:06.330> that<00:01:06.420> he

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
would use in the mini extruder that he

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.270 
would use in the mini extruder that he
designed<00:01:06.930> okay<00:01:07.680> so<00:01:07.740> that's<00:01:07.950> just<00:01:08.040> simply

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
designed okay so that's just simply

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.120 
designed okay so that's just simply
strapped<00:01:09.060> onto<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:10.430> the<00:01:11.570> Z<00:01:12.710> motor<00:01:13.710> bucket

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
strapped onto the the Z motor bucket

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.149 
strapped onto the the Z motor bucket
there<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.549> then<00:01:14.729> we've<00:01:14.880> got<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.330> small<00:01:16.580> rubber

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
there and then we've got a small rubber

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.060 
there and then we've got a small rubber
coupling<00:01:20.720> then<00:01:21.720> it's<00:01:22.020> not<00:01:22.140> very<00:01:22.409> clear<00:01:22.830> but

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
coupling then it's not very clear but

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.050 
coupling then it's not very clear but
this<00:01:23.250> is<00:01:23.400> actually<00:01:23.640> a<00:01:23.930> square<00:01:24.930> board<00:01:26.060> which

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
this is actually a square board which

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.539 
this is actually a square board which
was<00:01:27.299> taken<00:01:27.750> from<00:01:27.869> an<00:01:27.990> old<00:01:28.080> printer<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:28.979> then

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
was taken from an old printer and then

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:30.469 
was taken from an old printer and then
what<00:01:29.700> I've<00:01:29.790> done<00:01:29.909> is<00:01:30.060> I've<00:01:30.180> actually<00:01:30.240> just

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
what I've done is I've actually just

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.999 
what I've done is I've actually just
designed<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:31.170> small<00:01:31.710> bracket<00:01:32.009> here<00:01:33.770> as<00:01:34.770> the

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
designed a small bracket here as the

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.830 
designed a small bracket here as the
base<00:01:35.189> of<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.640> extruder<00:01:36.180> in<00:01:36.720> order<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.079> hold<00:01:37.229> a

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
base of the extruder in order to hold a

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.740 
base of the extruder in order to hold a
drive<00:01:39.840> gear<00:01:40.170> in<00:01:40.350> place<00:01:41.119> and<00:01:42.119> then<00:01:42.270> over<00:01:42.540> on<00:01:42.600> the

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
drive gear in place and then over on the

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.389 
drive gear in place and then over on the
other<00:01:42.780> side<00:01:43.079> here<00:01:43.350> on<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.740> idler<00:01:44.040> side<00:01:44.250> I've

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
other side here on the idler side I've

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.649 
other side here on the idler side I've
just<00:01:44.549> simply<00:01:44.850> strapped<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.920> bearing<00:01:47.090> on<00:01:48.090> the

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
just simply strapped a bearing on the

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.090 
just simply strapped a bearing on the
side<00:01:48.840> very<00:01:49.229> kind<00:01:49.500> of<00:01:49.530> rough<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:49.860> ready<00:01:49.950> but

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
side very kind of rough and ready but

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.569 
side very kind of rough and ready but
just<00:01:50.399> to<00:01:50.460> show<00:01:50.610> how<00:01:50.880> it<00:01:50.909> would<00:01:51.119> work<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.540> then

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
just to show how it would work and then

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:55.340 
just to show how it would work and then
of<00:01:53.579> course<00:01:53.790> as<00:01:54.119> soon<00:01:54.270> as<00:01:54.390> I<00:01:54.479> built<00:01:54.899> this<00:01:55.110> and

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
of course as soon as I built this and

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.590 
of course as soon as I built this and
put<00:01:55.890> this<00:01:55.979> together<00:01:56.130> I<00:01:56.310> realized<00:01:56.700> that<00:01:56.820> I<00:01:57.000> may

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
put this together I realized that I may

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.080 
put this together I realized that I may
be<00:01:57.659> a<00:01:57.750> better<00:01:58.020> design<00:01:58.439> for<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:59.130> drive<00:01:59.520> gear<00:01:59.790> is

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
be a better design for the drive gear is

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.160 
be a better design for the drive gear is
to<00:02:00.540> use<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:01.430> heaven-born<00:02:02.430> guy<00:02:02.939> gear<00:02:03.600> when<00:02:03.990> that

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
to use a heaven-born guy gear when that

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.410 
to use a heaven-born guy gear when that
might<00:02:04.380> stay<00:02:04.649> in<00:02:04.680> place<00:02:05.040> without<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.240> need<00:02:06.390> of

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
might stay in place without the need of

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.800 
might stay in place without the need of
a<00:02:06.750> bracket<00:02:07.940> I'm<00:02:08.940> not<00:02:09.090> sure<00:02:09.239> how<00:02:09.420> long<00:02:09.450> that

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
a bracket I'm not sure how long that

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:10.279 
a bracket I'm not sure how long that
would<00:02:10.080> be

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
would be

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:49.500 
would be
that's

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.930 

so<00:02:50.410> the<00:02:50.920> whole<00:02:51.160> point<00:02:51.400> of<00:02:51.519> doing<00:02:51.640> this<00:02:51.790> of

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
so the whole point of doing this of

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.699 
so the whole point of doing this of
course<00:02:51.970> would<00:02:52.269> be<00:02:52.299> to<00:02:52.420> make<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:56.530> whole<00:02:56.680> thing

00:02:56.699 --> 00:02:56.709 
course would be to make the whole thing

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:58.830 
course would be to make the whole thing
lighter<00:02:57.130> so<00:02:57.519> it<00:02:57.610> could<00:02:57.730> go<00:02:57.819> faster<00:02:58.330> and<00:02:58.630> so

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
lighter so it could go faster and so

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.190 
lighter so it could go faster and so
what<00:02:58.959> I've<00:02:59.049> done<00:02:59.170> is<00:02:59.230> I've<00:02:59.410> pre-loaded<00:03:00.130> a

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
what I've done is I've pre-loaded a

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:11.330 
what I've done is I've pre-loaded a
design<00:03:02.200> with<00:03:02.590> two<00:03:03.420> millimeters<00:03:04.420> per<00:03:04.599> second

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.589 

going<00:03:12.340> a<00:03:12.489> little<00:03:12.610> bit<00:03:12.790> faster<00:03:13.209> than<00:03:13.390> I

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599 
going a little bit faster than I

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:19.800 
going a little bit faster than I
normally<00:03:14.080> would

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:25.300 

so<00:03:21.970> there's<00:03:22.970> a<00:03:23.060> few<00:03:23.240> things<00:03:23.450> I<00:03:23.810> it's<00:03:24.800> quite<00:03:25.040> out

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
so there's a few things I it's quite out

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.140 
so there's a few things I it's quite out
of<00:03:25.670> focus

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
of focus

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.699 
of focus
okay<00:03:29.269> okay<00:03:30.269> let's<00:03:30.599> just<00:03:30.720> pause<00:03:30.989> a<00:03:31.019> second<00:03:31.620> so

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
okay okay let's just pause a second so

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:32.780 
okay okay let's just pause a second so
there's<00:03:31.890> a<00:03:31.920> few<00:03:32.069> things<00:03:32.250> that<00:03:32.310> I<00:03:32.430> noticed

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
there's a few things that I noticed

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.789 
there's a few things that I noticed
while<00:03:33.030> I<00:03:33.239> was<00:03:33.269> putting<00:03:33.480> this<00:03:33.659> together<00:03:33.810> that

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
while I was putting this together that

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.559 
while I was putting this together that
might<00:03:35.010> be<00:03:35.129> worth<00:03:35.280> keeping<00:03:35.459> in<00:03:35.670> mind<00:03:35.730> should

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
might be worth keeping in mind should

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:40.250 
might be worth keeping in mind should
anybody<00:03:36.780> really<00:03:37.349> want<00:03:37.560> to<00:03:38.750> build<00:03:39.750> something

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
anybody really want to build something

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.110 
anybody really want to build something
similar<00:03:40.440> or<00:03:40.799> design<00:03:41.340> something<00:03:41.700> similar<00:03:42.030> the

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
similar or design something similar the

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:48.100 
similar or design something similar the
first<00:03:42.299> thing<00:03:42.450> is<00:03:42.569> that<00:03:42.890> I<00:03:45.170> try<00:03:46.170> and<00:03:46.200> make<00:03:46.500> the

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:48.110 
first thing is that I try and make the

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.690 
first thing is that I try and make the
this<00:03:49.110> part<00:03:49.790> pretty<00:03:50.790> static<00:03:51.329> because<00:03:52.079> you<00:03:52.470> can

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
this part pretty static because you can

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.289 
this part pretty static because you can
set<00:03:53.700> the<00:03:53.879> motor<00:03:54.120> and<00:03:54.510> the<00:03:54.780> idler<00:03:55.849> to<00:03:56.849> a<00:03:56.879> fixed

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
set the motor and the idler to a fixed

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.690 
set the motor and the idler to a fixed
position<00:03:57.540> and<00:03:58.110> then<00:03:58.920> you<00:03:59.040> could<00:03:59.190> actually<00:03:59.310> fix

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
position and then you could actually fix

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.990 
position and then you could actually fix
this<00:04:00.470> make<00:04:01.470> this<00:04:01.620> quite<00:04:01.799> static<00:04:02.190> in<00:04:02.609> relation

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
this make this quite static in relation

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.849 
this make this quite static in relation
to<00:04:03.030> that<00:04:03.120> so<00:04:03.329> it's<00:04:03.450> a<00:04:03.510> good<00:04:03.660> fit<00:04:03.870> and<00:04:04.230> then<00:04:04.620> make

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
to that so it's a good fit and then make

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:09.229 
to that so it's a good fit and then make
the<00:04:05.220> extruder<00:04:07.459> make<00:04:08.459> the<00:04:08.579> base<00:04:08.790> that<00:04:09.120> this

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
the extruder make the base that this

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:12.140 
the extruder make the base that this
extruders<00:04:09.750> attached<00:04:10.379> to<00:04:10.590> with<00:04:11.549> instead<00:04:12.090> of

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
extruders attached to with instead of

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.030 
extruders attached to with instead of
using<00:04:12.359> holes<00:04:12.720> you<00:04:12.989> could<00:04:13.170> use<00:04:13.319> some<00:04:13.500> slots<00:04:13.799> and

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
using holes you could use some slots and

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.740 
using holes you could use some slots and
move<00:04:14.489> this<00:04:14.609> back<00:04:14.819> and<00:04:14.970> forth<00:04:15.030> in<00:04:15.359> order<00:04:15.540> to<00:04:15.659> get

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
move this back and forth in order to get

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:21.259 
move this back and forth in order to get
a<00:04:15.780> good<00:04:16.019> grip<00:04:16.680> with<00:04:16.949> the<00:04:17.150> drive<00:04:18.150> gear<00:04:20.180> that<00:04:21.180> you

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
a good grip with the drive gear that you

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:22.700 
a good grip with the drive gear that you
know<00:04:21.359> that<00:04:21.479> would<00:04:21.600> be<00:04:21.630> the<00:04:21.810> flexibility<00:04:22.350> yeah

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
know that would be the flexibility yeah

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.450 
know that would be the flexibility yeah
then<00:04:23.550> I<00:04:24.000> would<00:04:24.600> probably<00:04:25.220> what<00:04:26.220> I've<00:04:26.340> done

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
then I would probably what I've done

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:27.980 
then I would probably what I've done
here<00:04:26.610> is<00:04:26.669> put<00:04:26.940> a<00:04:26.970> few<00:04:27.150> holes<00:04:27.270> at<00:04:27.570> the<00:04:27.660> top<00:04:27.690> so

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
here is put a few holes at the top so

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.260 
here is put a few holes at the top so
you<00:04:28.080> could<00:04:28.229> actually<00:04:28.729> so<00:04:29.729> this<00:04:29.880> whole

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
you could actually so this whole

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.350 
you could actually so this whole
contraption<00:04:30.840> isn't<00:04:31.139> stuck<00:04:31.470> together<00:04:32.360> that

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
contraption isn't stuck together that

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.790 
contraption isn't stuck together that
you<00:04:33.570> can<00:04:33.720> actually<00:04:33.900> take<00:04:34.139> it<00:04:34.289> apart<00:04:34.560> I

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
you can actually take it apart I

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.860 
you can actually take it apart I
probably<00:04:35.130> actually<00:04:35.310> redo<00:04:36.030> this<00:04:36.210> either<00:04:36.450> as<00:04:36.780> I

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
probably actually redo this either as I

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.270 
probably actually redo this either as I
say<00:04:37.020> with<00:04:37.169> having<00:04:37.470> bone<00:04:37.650> gears<00:04:37.950> that's

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
say with having bone gears that's

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.580 
say with having bone gears that's
probably<00:04:38.550> a<00:04:38.610> good<00:04:38.729> idea<00:04:38.990> worth<00:04:39.990> trying<00:04:40.289> or

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:40.590 
probably a good idea worth trying or

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.089 
probably a good idea worth trying or
actually<00:04:41.370> using<00:04:41.729> a<00:04:42.000> gap<00:04:42.570> in<00:04:42.720> the<00:04:42.780> back<00:04:42.990> here<00:04:43.410> so

00:04:44.089 --> 00:04:44.099 
actually using a gap in the back here so

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:46.490 
actually using a gap in the back here so
that<00:04:44.970> you<00:04:45.270> can<00:04:45.419> just<00:04:45.539> simply<00:04:45.870> put<00:04:46.080> this<00:04:46.229> whole

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
that you can just simply put this whole

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.710 
that you can just simply put this whole
wad<00:04:46.770> in<00:04:46.979> place<00:04:47.310> that<00:04:48.180> might<00:04:48.360> be<00:04:48.510> quite<00:04:48.690> good

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
wad in place that might be quite good

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.960 
wad in place that might be quite good
and<00:04:49.050> another<00:04:49.919> idea<00:04:50.250> would<00:04:50.370> be<00:04:50.400> to<00:04:50.520> actually

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
and another idea would be to actually

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.250 
and another idea would be to actually
have<00:04:51.150> some<00:04:51.780> form<00:04:52.139> of<00:04:52.490> some<00:04:53.490> way<00:04:53.610> of<00:04:53.729> actually

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
have some form of some way of actually

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.960 
have some form of some way of actually
putting<00:04:55.260> a<00:04:55.410> springs<00:04:55.889> of<00:04:56.130> this<00:04:56.280> in<00:04:56.370> tension<00:04:56.789> so

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
putting a springs of this in tension so

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.120 
putting a springs of this in tension so
it's<00:04:57.090> actually<00:04:57.419> pushing<00:04:57.660> against<00:04:58.199> the<00:04:58.260> driven

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
it's actually pushing against the driven

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.640 
it's actually pushing against the driven
gear<00:04:59.370> I'll<00:05:00.240> whilst<00:05:00.539> it's<00:05:00.780> running<00:05:01.050> but

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
gear I'll whilst it's running but

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.469 
gear I'll whilst it's running but
without<00:05:01.889> actually<00:05:02.310> interfering<00:05:03.060> with<00:05:03.300> the

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:03.479 
without actually interfering with the

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:05.150 
without actually interfering with the
motion<00:05:04.050> you<00:05:04.320> know<00:05:04.410> I'd<00:05:04.500> have<00:05:04.590> to<00:05:04.650> think<00:05:04.919> about

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
motion you know I'd have to think about

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.250 
motion you know I'd have to think about
that<00:05:05.280> but<00:05:05.760> I<00:05:05.820> mean<00:05:06.000> if<00:05:06.150> you<00:05:06.300> really<00:05:06.720> put<00:05:07.139> this

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:07.260 
that but I mean if you really put this

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:11.900 
that but I mean if you really put this
in<00:05:07.560> place<00:05:08.510> so<00:05:09.510> that<00:05:10.440> it<00:05:10.800> was<00:05:11.430> you<00:05:11.820> know

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
in place so that it was you know

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.100 
in place so that it was you know
everything<00:05:12.210> lined<00:05:12.419> up<00:05:12.570> everything<00:05:12.960> measured

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
everything lined up everything measured

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.379 
everything lined up everything measured
and<00:05:13.380> so<00:05:14.010> that<00:05:14.160> everything<00:05:14.430> was<00:05:14.550> exact<00:05:15.000> you

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:15.389 
and so that everything was exact you

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:16.640 
and so that everything was exact you
could<00:05:15.539> probably<00:05:15.720> actually<00:05:15.900> get<00:05:16.169> this<00:05:16.320> to<00:05:16.500> fit

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650 
could probably actually get this to fit

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.129 
could probably actually get this to fit
really<00:05:16.979> quite<00:05:17.160> nicely<00:05:17.510> and<00:05:18.510> then<00:05:18.720> you<00:05:18.990> don't

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:19.139 
really quite nicely and then you don't

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:20.839 
really quite nicely and then you don't
really<00:05:19.349> need<00:05:19.560> a<00:05:19.620> spring<00:05:20.010> I<00:05:20.280> know<00:05:20.550> that's

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:20.849 
really need a spring I know that's

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:22.370 
really need a spring I know that's
certainly<00:05:21.090> one<00:05:21.240> idea<00:05:21.510> anyway<00:05:22.199> the<00:05:22.320> whole

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:22.380 
certainly one idea anyway the whole

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:27.279 
certainly one idea anyway the whole
thing<00:05:23.090> it's<00:05:24.090> quite<00:05:24.270> a<00:05:24.300> nice<00:05:24.389> when<00:05:25.260> I<00:05:25.440> get<00:05:25.710> my

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:27.289 
thing it's quite a nice when I get my

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:30.140 
thing it's quite a nice when I get my
the<00:05:28.289> whole<00:05:28.440> bolt<00:05:28.740> this<00:05:29.130> fixed<00:05:29.520> up<00:05:29.639> I<00:05:29.910> might

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
the whole bolt this fixed up I might

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.300 
the whole bolt this fixed up I might
actually<00:05:30.330> get<00:05:30.599> this<00:05:30.780> printing<00:05:31.349> but<00:05:31.560> seeing

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
actually get this printing but seeing

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:33.980 
actually get this printing but seeing
that<00:05:32.340> I'm<00:05:32.520> not<00:05:32.639> sure<00:05:32.820> when<00:05:33.120> I'll<00:05:33.240> get<00:05:33.419> time<00:05:33.720> I

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
that I'm not sure when I'll get time I

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:35.839 
that I'm not sure when I'll get time I
thought<00:05:34.139> I'd<00:05:34.289> actually<00:05:34.440> just<00:05:35.250> put<00:05:35.669> this<00:05:35.729> video

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:35.849 
thought I'd actually just put this video

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:40.909 
thought I'd actually just put this video
together<00:05:36.890> to<00:05:37.890> see<00:05:38.070> working<00:05:38.430> yeah
