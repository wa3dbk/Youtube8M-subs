the<00:00:37.020> description<00:00:37.230> so<00:00:37.559> you<00:00:37.590> can<00:00:37.680> avoid<00:00:37.860> them

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
the description so you can avoid them

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.670 
the description so you can avoid them
and<00:00:38.520> he<00:00:39.000> continually<00:00:39.690> news<00:00:39.960> kozlov<00:00:40.440> lives

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
and he continually news kozlov lives

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.010 
and he continually news kozlov lives
that<00:00:40.980> by<00:00:41.190> day<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.489> did<00:00:42.030> this<00:00:42.149> move<00:00:42.420> again<00:00:42.840> and

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
that by day and did this move again and

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.290 
that by day and did this move again and
again<00:00:43.290> it<00:00:43.530> is<00:00:43.920> irreversible<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:44.969> my<00:00:45.090> knowledge

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
again it is irreversible to my knowledge

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.479 
again it is irreversible to my knowledge
if<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.690> AI<00:00:45.930> can<00:00:46.469> reverse<00:00:46.739> it<00:00:46.920> normally<00:00:47.250> and

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
if the AI can reverse it normally and

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.569 
if the AI can reverse it normally and
then<00:00:47.610> come<00:00:47.940> first<00:00:48.300> it<00:00:48.710> 25<00:00:49.710> or<00:00:49.890> so<00:00:50.039> times<00:00:50.280> in<00:00:50.520> a

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
then come first it 25 or so times in a

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.580 
then come first it 25 or so times in a
row<00:00:50.760> there's<00:00:51.510> something<00:00:51.960> wrong<00:00:52.230> with<00:00:52.469> the

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
row there's something wrong with the

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.380 
row there's something wrong with the
game<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:52.980> something<00:00:53.820> wrong<00:00:53.969> with<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.210> move

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
game and something wrong with the move

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.150 
game and something wrong with the move
so<00:00:54.840> obviously<00:00:55.289> this<00:00:55.500> move<00:00:55.739> needs<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.039> be

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
so obviously this move needs to be

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.400 
so obviously this move needs to be
patched<00:00:56.340> what<00:00:57.030> annoys<00:00:57.239> me<00:00:57.480> most<00:00:57.690> is<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.230> you

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
patched what annoys me most is that you

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.290 
patched what annoys me most is that you
can<00:00:58.680> gain<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:58.980> signature<00:00:59.430> just<00:00:59.760> by<00:00:59.879> doing<00:00:59.940> this

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
can gain a signature just by doing this

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.310 
can gain a signature just by doing this
again<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:00.780> again<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.140> again<00:01:01.320> again<00:01:01.620> again

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
again and again and again again again

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.750 
again and again and again again again
which<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.439> fought<00:01:04.710> if<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:04.979> did<00:01:05.189> repetition

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
which I fought if you did repetition

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.820 
which I fought if you did repetition
moves<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.299> wouldn't<00:01:06.630> be<00:01:06.720> able<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:07.049> gain<00:01:07.619> any

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
moves you wouldn't be able to gain any

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.910 
moves you wouldn't be able to gain any
more<00:01:08.130> momentum<00:01:09.439> obviously<00:01:10.439> that's<00:01:10.619> not<00:01:10.710> the

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
more momentum obviously that's not the

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.679 
more momentum obviously that's not the
case<00:01:11.159> because<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:11.850> can<00:01:11.970> do<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:12.119> again<00:01:12.390> again

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
case because you can do it again again

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.810 
case because you can do it again again
again<00:01:12.810> again<00:01:13.080> again<00:01:13.350> again<00:01:13.560> again<00:01:14.330> give<00:01:15.330> you

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
again again again again again give you

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.850 
again again again again again give you

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
just kicked out he had to win by

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.210 
just kicked out he had to win by
count-out<00:01:40.079> because<00:01:40.320> it<00:01:40.409> was<00:01:40.530> so<00:01:40.799> scared<00:01:41.159> of

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
count-out because it was so scared of

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.240 
count-out because it was so scared of
losing<00:01:41.540> the<00:01:42.540> arguing<00:01:42.899> is<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.500> wasn't<00:01:44.040> me<00:01:44.220> I

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
losing the arguing is it wasn't me I

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.530

mean<00:01:44.610> you<00:01:44.790> know<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.540> irony<00:01:46.049> is<00:01:47.390> it<00:01:48.390> was<00:01:48.420> a

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
mean you know the irony is it was a
