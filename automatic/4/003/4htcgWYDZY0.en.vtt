00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
is where the first super I put on hoping

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.790

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
they'd use it as for brood box but they

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.069 
they'd use it as for brood box but they
didn't<00:00:59.010> they<00:00:59.070> put<00:00:59.190> honey<00:00:59.430> in<00:00:59.520> it<00:00:59.730> and<00:00:59.989> then<00:01:00.989> I

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
didn't they put honey in it and then I

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.649 
didn't they put honey in it and then I
put<00:01:01.109> this<00:01:01.440> one<00:01:01.649> in<00:01:01.920> as<00:01:03.110> a<00:01:04.110> second<00:01:04.589> super<00:01:05.479> and<00:01:06.479> I

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
put this one in as a second super and I

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:07.850 
put this one in as a second super and I
