00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.830
 I will know much better not to the 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.050
 selection of mexico to what to those who 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.939
 go and it's going to be a party 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.529
 special I do not also imagine that 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.980
 I will have several of my classmates playing 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.980
 there 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.970
 it's a time of transition we're not 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.540
 before a new camera of players that 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:42.870
 are obviously starting with 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:45.989
 difficulties not being able to assimilate the 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.449
 importance is not the responsibility of 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.400
 play in the selection that matches 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:52.640
 also with great moments not from other 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:56.780
 elections so 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:59.030
 that without a doubt that also makes it 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.420
 very complicated not the competition now 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:05.790
 in South America but well I think that the 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:08.430
 you have not met 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.200
 the good and immediately afterwards what 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.140
 worse than there is can not classified 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.250
 world is made 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.210
 see truly not how beautiful it is 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.270
 win matches with the national team 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.250
 enjoy ratings 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.340
 and that hunger has to be there now 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.689
 dependent so let's hope that 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.610
 good that this is a new beginning 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.860
 that the selection now lives another 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.659
 glory stage and recover the 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.200
 prestige that we lost in the past 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.200
 four years 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.810
 well I think you should play for the 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:49.740
 selection has always been a motivation 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:53.230
 to be well to be on top 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.300
 be the best in my position 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:57.930
 and today I still keep it 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.930
 seeing the same
