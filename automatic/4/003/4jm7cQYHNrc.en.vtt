00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
bag and basically guys I don't think

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.679 
bag and basically guys I don't think
it's<00:01:13.320> fair<00:01:13.590> if<00:01:14.010> um<00:01:14.490> because<00:01:15.090> what<00:01:15.299> is<00:01:15.420> if<00:01:15.540> the

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
it's fair if um because what is if the

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.060 
it's fair if um because what is if the
angle<00:01:16.140> had

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
angle had

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.240 
angle had
leftover<00:01:18.070> once<00:01:18.850> the<00:01:19.210> angry<00:01:20.020> the<00:01:20.350> one<00:01:20.619> single

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
leftover once the angry the one single

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.510 
leftover once the angry the one single
close<00:01:22.180> amox<00:01:22.540> we<00:01:22.720> kill<00:01:22.960> them<00:01:23.110> so<00:01:23.380> I<00:01:23.409> can<00:01:23.560> be<00:01:24.220> fair

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
close amox we kill them so I can be fair

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.480 
close amox we kill them so I can be fair
so<00:01:24.899> person<00:01:25.899> I<00:01:26.049> think<00:01:26.320> we<00:01:26.470> should<00:01:26.680> just<00:01:26.710> um<00:01:27.100> you

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
so person I think we should just um you

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.660 
so person I think we should just um you
up<00:01:27.700> to<00:01:28.270> me<00:01:28.420> to<00:01:28.740> just<00:01:29.740> prepare<00:01:30.130> because<00:01:30.280> it'd<00:01:30.549> be

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
up to me to just prepare because it'd be

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.069 
up to me to just prepare because it'd be
pretty<00:01:30.820> obvious<00:01:31.060> that<00:01:31.390> the<00:01:31.509> two<00:01:31.659> ghosts<00:01:31.990> the

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:32.079 
pretty obvious that the two ghosts the

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:34.710 
pretty obvious that the two ghosts the
monsters<00:01:32.500> would<00:01:33.100> end<00:01:33.369> up<00:01:33.610> killing<00:01:34.240> the<00:01:34.509> iron

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
monsters would end up killing the iron

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.690 
monsters would end up killing the iron
golem<00:01:35.140> pretty<00:01:35.320> easily<00:01:35.530> about<00:01:35.950> just<00:01:36.220> wouldn't

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
golem pretty easily about just wouldn't

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.310 
golem pretty easily about just wouldn't
be<00:01:36.759> apparent<00:01:37.299> much<00:01:37.539> of<00:01:37.659> a<00:01:37.689> fair<00:01:37.869> fight<00:01:37.899> but<00:01:38.259> at

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
be apparent much of a fair fight but at

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.249 
be apparent much of a fair fight but at
