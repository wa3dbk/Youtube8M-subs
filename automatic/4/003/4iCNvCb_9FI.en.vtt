00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
Queen you also have a player who as long

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.540 
Queen you also have a player who as long
as<00:02:52.440> he's<00:02:52.560> holding<00:02:52.830> the<00:02:52.920> ball<00:02:53.100> it<00:02:53.370> takes

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
as he's holding the ball it takes

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:54.860 
as he's holding the ball it takes
himself<00:02:53.700> out<00:02:53.940> of<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.090> play<00:02:54.239> right<00:02:54.480> you<00:02:54.630> can't

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
himself out of the play right you can't

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.050 
himself out of the play right you can't
provide<00:02:55.170> covering<00:02:55.620> fire<00:02:55.650> across<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.640> map<00:02:56.850> so

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
provide covering fire across the map so

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.150 
provide covering fire across the map so
I<00:02:57.239> agree<00:02:57.660> typically<00:02:58.440> I<00:02:58.530> think<00:02:58.800> at<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:59.040> high

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
I agree typically I think at the high

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.470 
I agree typically I think at the high
level<00:02:59.190> of<00:02:59.550> competition<00:02:59.970> we're<00:03:00.209> gonna<00:03:00.300> see

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
level of competition we're gonna see

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.880 
level of competition we're gonna see
players<00:03:00.690> really<00:03:00.959> throwing<00:03:01.350> the<00:03:01.590> ball<00:03:01.709> right

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
players really throwing the ball right

players really throwing the ball right

there getting another run the blue team

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.990 
there getting another run the blue team
extends<00:03:04.200> their<00:03:04.320> lead<00:03:04.380> now<00:03:04.709> to<00:03:04.770> a<00:03:04.980> hundred<00:03:05.340> but

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
extends their lead now to a hundred but

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.160

right here we have a blue team Batman 93

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.000 
right here we have a blue team Batman 93
might<00:03:09.930> hit<00:03:10.080> this<00:03:10.200> throw<00:03:10.470> from<00:03:10.500> here<00:03:10.860> that's

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
might hit this throw from here that's

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.530 
might hit this throw from here that's
doable<00:03:11.370> we'll<00:03:11.820> see<00:03:11.970> if<00:03:12.030> he<00:03:12.090> takes<00:03:12.150> a<00:03:12.330> few<00:03:12.450> steps

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
doable we'll see if he takes a few steps

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.270 
doable we'll see if he takes a few steps
forward<00:03:12.840> but<00:03:13.020> instead<00:03:13.320> plays<00:03:13.680> it<00:03:13.830> safe<00:03:14.010> once

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
forward but instead plays it safe once

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.190 
forward but instead plays it safe once
again<00:03:14.400> waits<00:03:15.060> for<00:03:15.209> his<00:03:15.360> teammates<00:03:15.810> to<00:03:15.930> spawn

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
again waits for his teammates to spawn

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.840 
again waits for his teammates to spawn
now<00:03:16.590> gonna<00:03:16.800> try<00:03:16.950> to<00:03:17.010> flank<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.430> ball<00:03:17.580> around

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
interesting choice i mean he he was

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.560 
interesting choice i mean he he was
right<00:03:26.190> there<00:03:26.220> wasn't<00:03:26.820> contested<00:03:27.120> the<00:03:27.299> ball

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
right there wasn't contested the ball

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
spawned in his hands and he had the goal

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.130 
spawned in his hands and he had the goal
in<00:03:29.519> sight<00:03:29.790> I<00:03:30.090> almost<00:03:30.420> would<00:03:30.720> have<00:03:30.810> just<00:03:31.019> like

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
in sight I almost would have just like

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.960 
in sight I almost would have just like
thrown<00:03:31.470> it<00:03:31.650> right<00:03:31.950> there<00:03:32.250> and<00:03:32.519> he<00:03:32.760> would<00:03:32.850> have

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
thrown it right there and he would have

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.699 
thrown it right there and he would have
gotten<00:03:33.090> a<00:03:33.209> quick<00:03:33.510> like<00:03:33.720> 20<00:03:34.080> points<00:03:34.350> on<00:03:34.440> top<00:03:34.590> of

don't know if it's always worth it oh

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.440 
don't know if it's always worth it oh
let<00:03:41.070> me<00:03:41.100> get<00:03:41.280> the<00:03:41.370> ball<00:03:41.519> back<00:03:41.850> up<00:03:42.120> and<00:03:42.299> try<00:03:42.360> to

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
let me get the ball back up and try to

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.210 
let me get the ball back up and try to
regroup<00:03:42.720> at<00:03:43.019> that<00:03:43.380> point<00:03:43.650> just<00:03:43.799> throw<00:03:44.040> it<00:03:44.190> in

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
regroup at that point just throw it in

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.770 
regroup at that point just throw it in
there<00:03:44.370> keep<00:03:44.549> the<00:03:44.700> pressure<00:03:44.880> on<00:03:45.120> keep<00:03:45.420> the<00:03:45.570> ball

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
there keep the pressure on keep the ball

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.509 
there keep the pressure on keep the ball
over<00:03:46.049> on<00:03:46.200> their<00:03:46.470> side<00:03:46.709> of<00:03:46.739> the<00:03:46.860> map<00:03:47.100> and<00:03:47.400> right

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
over on their side of the map and right

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:48.710 
over on their side of the map and right
there<00:03:47.670> blue<00:03:47.820> team's<00:03:48.030> gonna<00:03:48.120> run<00:03:48.420> that<00:03:48.570> in

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
there blue team's gonna run that in

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.360 
there blue team's gonna run that in
again<00:03:49.019> it<00:03:49.200> looks<00:03:49.320> like<00:03:49.530> a<00:03:49.590> little<00:03:49.799> throw<00:03:50.190> right

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
again it looks like a little throw right

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:51.860 
again it looks like a little throw right
there<00:03:50.400> so<00:03:50.640> what<00:03:50.760> we<00:03:50.880> saw<00:03:51.060> was<00:03:51.209> a<00:03:51.269> player<00:03:51.540> dying

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
there so what we saw was a player dying

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.380 
there so what we saw was a player dying
right<00:03:52.200> before<00:03:52.230> they<00:03:52.769> went<00:03:53.070> for<00:03:53.370> the<00:03:53.549> run<00:03:53.760> so

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
right before they went for the run so

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:55.640 
right before they went for the run so
that's<00:03:54.540> going<00:03:54.660> to<00:03:54.750> actually<00:03:54.870> equal<00:03:55.320> a<00:03:55.350> throw

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
that's going to actually equal a throw

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.340 
that's going to actually equal a throw
as<00:03:55.920> well<00:03:56.160> as<00:03:56.370> their<00:03:56.730> dying<00:03:57.330> corpse<00:03:57.690> tosses<00:03:58.260> the

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
as well as their dying corpse tosses the

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.949 
as well as their dying corpse tosses the
ball<00:03:58.549> desperately<00:03:59.549> into<00:03:59.730> the<00:03:59.820> goal<00:04:00.000> so<00:04:00.239> a<00:04:00.510> nice

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
ball desperately into the goal so a nice

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.600 
ball desperately into the goal so a nice
job<00:04:01.230> there<00:04:01.260> so<00:04:01.650> we<00:04:01.920> also<00:04:02.070> just<00:04:02.130> got<00:04:02.310> an<00:04:02.459> update

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
job there so we also just got an update

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:04.250 
job there so we also just got an update
from<00:04:02.850> the<00:04:03.150> floor<00:04:03.450> that<00:04:03.480> the<00:04:03.750> team<00:04:03.989> on<00:04:04.140> the

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
from the floor that the team on the

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.380 
from the floor that the team on the
other<00:04:04.440> side<00:04:04.739> their<00:04:04.950> winning<00:04:05.220> streak<00:04:05.250> is<00:04:05.670> 3<00:04:06.360> so

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
other side their winning streak is 3 so

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:07.910 
other side their winning streak is 3 so
right<00:04:06.810> now<00:04:06.840> you<00:04:07.019> can<00:04:07.290> bet<00:04:07.440> that<00:04:07.470> these<00:04:07.739> two

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
right now you can bet that these two

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.640 
right now you can bet that these two
teams<00:04:08.160> at<00:04:08.370> at<00:04:08.700> five<00:04:09.030> and<00:04:09.209> four<00:04:09.660> and<00:04:09.840> three<00:04:10.110> are

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
teams at at five and four and three are

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:11.750 
teams at at five and four and three are
the<00:04:10.709> current<00:04:11.070> leaders<00:04:11.370> and<00:04:11.519> they're<00:04:11.610> probably

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
the current leaders and they're probably

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.729 
the current leaders and they're probably
at<00:04:12.090> this<00:04:12.299> point<00:04:12.540> going<00:04:12.900> to<00:04:12.989> face<00:04:13.170> off<00:04:13.440> against

it's a competition especially in halo

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:21.349

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.510 
has always been my favorite it's always
been<00:04:21.479> great<00:04:21.690> to<00:04:21.840> see<00:04:22.049> two<00:04:22.890> teams<00:04:23.130> come<00:04:23.340> and

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
been great to see two teams come and

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.800 
been great to see two teams come and
duke<00:04:23.640> it<00:04:23.789> out<00:04:23.880> everything<00:04:24.270> that<00:04:24.300> halo<00:04:24.599> brings

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
duke it out everything that halo brings

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:25.700 
duke it out everything that halo brings
to<00:04:24.900> the<00:04:24.990> table

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
to the table

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.249 
to the table
weapons<00:04:25.979> grenades<00:04:26.400> melee<00:04:27.060> and<00:04:27.419> now<00:04:27.750> ricochet

00:04:28.249 --> 00:04:28.259 
weapons grenades melee and now ricochet

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:30.170 
weapons grenades melee and now ricochet
I<00:04:28.289> think<00:04:28.560> it<00:04:28.650> actually<00:04:28.830> become<00:04:29.370> a<00:04:29.400> classic<00:04:29.759> as

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
I think it actually become a classic as

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.999 
I think it actually become a classic as
we're<00:04:30.660> looking<00:04:30.960> right<00:04:31.169> here<00:04:31.440> yeah<00:04:31.830> absolutely

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:32.009 
we're looking right here yeah absolutely

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:33.350 
we're looking right here yeah absolutely
really<00:04:32.370> enjoying<00:04:32.669> what<00:04:32.819> we're<00:04:32.910> seeing<00:04:33.060> so<00:04:33.330> far

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
really enjoying what we're seeing so far

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.360 
really enjoying what we're seeing so far
as<00:04:33.750> you<00:04:33.870> see<00:04:34.050> teams<00:04:34.259> doing<00:04:34.919> quite<00:04:35.160> well<00:04:35.220> but

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
as you see teams doing quite well but

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:36.650 
as you see teams doing quite well but
back<00:04:35.610> to<00:04:35.729> we<00:04:35.789> were<00:04:35.910> saying<00:04:36.090> about<00:04:36.180> clearing

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
back to we were saying about clearing

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.270 
back to we were saying about clearing
Quinn<00:04:36.900> I<00:04:37.050> think<00:04:37.500> really<00:04:37.620> if<00:04:37.800> you<00:04:37.919> clear<00:04:38.160> the

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
Quinn I think really if you clear the

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.159 
Quinn I think really if you clear the
ball<00:04:38.430> you<00:04:38.550> also<00:04:38.849> establish<00:04:39.389> like<00:04:39.870> we<00:04:39.990> said

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169 
ball you also establish like we said

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:41.540 
ball you also establish like we said
kind<00:04:40.440> of<00:04:40.500> baiting<00:04:40.830> the<00:04:40.919> enemy<00:04:41.130> team<00:04:41.310> right

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
kind of baiting the enemy team right

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.070 
kind of baiting the enemy team right
they<00:04:41.669> have<00:04:41.849> to<00:04:42.000> focus<00:04:42.180> on<00:04:42.479> exactly<00:04:42.810> where<00:04:42.990> the

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
they have to focus on exactly where the

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.260 
they have to focus on exactly where the
ball<00:04:43.259> is<00:04:43.289> and<00:04:44.069> then<00:04:44.190> you<00:04:44.280> can<00:04:44.430> then<00:04:44.759> focus<00:04:45.000> on

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
ball is and then you can then focus on

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.939 
ball is and then you can then focus on
map<00:04:45.509> control<00:04:45.870> move<00:04:46.080> the<00:04:46.199> ball<00:04:46.349> across<00:04:46.560> and

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:46.949 
map control move the ball across and

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:48.379 
map control move the ball across and
then<00:04:47.190> once<00:04:47.400> again<00:04:47.610> pick<00:04:47.789> it<00:04:47.880> up<00:04:47.970> but<00:04:48.120> we<00:04:48.150> also

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:48.389 
then once again pick it up but we also

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:50.719 
then once again pick it up but we also
have<00:04:48.690> to<00:04:48.720> mention<00:04:49.050> that<00:04:49.500> the<00:04:49.860> ball<00:04:50.069> does<00:04:50.400> have

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:50.729 
have to mention that the ball does have

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:53.510 
have to mention that the ball does have
a<00:04:51.000> reset<00:04:51.720> delay<00:04:52.020> so<00:04:52.229> if<00:04:52.650> you<00:04:52.919> chuck<00:04:53.220> the<00:04:53.370> ball

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
a reset delay so if you chuck the ball

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.370 
a reset delay so if you chuck the ball
and<00:04:53.669> no<00:04:53.789> one<00:04:53.910> picks<00:04:54.120> it<00:04:54.300> up<00:04:54.419> for<00:04:54.630> 15<00:04:54.990> seconds

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
and no one picks it up for 15 seconds

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:56.719 
and no one picks it up for 15 seconds
it's<00:04:55.500> also<00:04:55.620> going<00:04:55.800> to<00:04:55.860> reset<00:04:56.250> so<00:04:56.400> you<00:04:56.460> can't

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:56.729 
it's also going to reset so you can't

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:58.610 
it's also going to reset so you can't
mindlessly<00:04:57.210> throw<00:04:57.840> it<00:04:58.020> to<00:04:58.139> another<00:04:58.289> side<00:04:58.590> of

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
mindlessly throw it to another side of

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:00.320 
mindlessly throw it to another side of
the<00:04:58.710> map<00:04:58.889> you<00:04:59.280> need<00:04:59.430> to<00:04:59.520> be<00:04:59.639> strategic<00:04:59.789> in<00:05:00.270> how

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
the map you need to be strategic in how

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.300 
the map you need to be strategic in how
you<00:05:00.509> move<00:05:00.810> the<00:05:00.930> ball<00:05:01.080> across<00:05:01.770> the<00:05:02.009> map<00:05:02.160> and

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
you move the ball across the map and

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.909 
you move the ball across the map and
advance<00:05:02.610> forward<00:05:02.940> yeah<00:05:03.810> to<00:05:04.320> me<00:05:04.440> is<00:05:04.620> like<00:05:04.650> I

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919 
advance forward yeah to me is like I

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:07.460 
advance forward yeah to me is like I
think<00:05:05.729> about<00:05:05.880> this<00:05:05.970> more<00:05:06.180> Bravo<00:05:06.539> I<00:05:06.660> mean<00:05:06.840> if<00:05:07.320> I

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
think about this more Bravo I mean if I

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.950 
think about this more Bravo I mean if I
had<00:05:07.650> the<00:05:07.770> ball<00:05:07.949> I<00:05:08.190> almost<00:05:08.370> wouldn't<00:05:08.960> be

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
had the ball I almost wouldn't be

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.870 
had the ball I almost wouldn't be
carrying<00:05:10.410> it<00:05:10.530> the<00:05:10.680> whole<00:05:10.830> time<00:05:11.039> I'd<00:05:11.340> almost<00:05:11.580> be

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
carrying it the whole time I'd almost be

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.180 
carrying it the whole time I'd almost be
like<00:05:12.180> kind<00:05:12.870> of<00:05:12.960> throwing<00:05:13.020> it<00:05:13.500> at<00:05:13.620> my<00:05:13.770> feet<00:05:14.039> in

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.190 
like kind of throwing it at my feet in

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:15.650 
like kind of throwing it at my feet in
front<00:05:14.400> of<00:05:14.550> me<00:05:14.610> and<00:05:14.880> then<00:05:14.970> let<00:05:15.120> myself<00:05:15.270> walk

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 
front of me and then let myself walk

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.839 
front of me and then let myself walk
every<00:05:15.960> few<00:05:16.199> steps<00:05:16.259> almost<00:05:17.130> like<00:05:17.310> juggling

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:17.849 
every few steps almost like juggling

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:19.700 
every few steps almost like juggling
that<00:05:18.210> we've<00:05:18.360> seen<00:05:18.630> it<00:05:18.750> right<00:05:18.870> halo<00:05:19.470> right

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:19.710 
that we've seen it right halo right
