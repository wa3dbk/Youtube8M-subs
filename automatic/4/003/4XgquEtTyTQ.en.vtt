00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 but also youtube here we have the 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:07.319
 samsung galaxy time 53 30 this video will 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.050
 I will teach how to activate and deactivate 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.940
 predictive text the predictive text in 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.769
 this is already a little complex since 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.570
 normally since that phone does not 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.029
 I was driving for the on-screen keyboard 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.949
 but it handles it here externally and 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.260
 it's a completely physical keyboard 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.720
 similar to those of blackberry however 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.730
 you can activate this cash for it 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.070
 first we must activate the text 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.689
 screen that is to say that taking in 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.700
 that the screen is touch is 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.450
 activate the screen text for example 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.370
 if we are going to write of anything it is 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.719
 the only way to introduce something is to 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.890
 through this keyboard that we have here 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.890
 for example if we continue hello 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.030
 now we will leave the options as they are 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.790
 or not activated predictive text by 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.220
 here just the introduction 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.510
 It is completely manual and physical 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.699
 I will give a demonstration 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.440
 activating the predictive text are going to 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.850
 leave them completely like the 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:05.360
 configuration languages â€‹â€‹and introduction 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:08.630
 language introduction a keyboard machine 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:11.659
 samsung and as merely practical 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.850
 is activated however it did not show 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:15.500
 the projective detected options for 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.620
 that can not be the option in this 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.280
 target we must lower 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:23.230
 and activate the on-screen keyboard with the 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.700
 option cabin that I made 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.700
 screen keyboard 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:33.510
 do not look for the automatic punctuation do 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:35.680
 only in capital letters continuous introduction 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.530
 around here it is 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.990
 declared on screen and is keyboard on 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.930
 screen is within the language menu 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.030
 introduction we lower keyboard on screen 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:49.690
 we activate it and that way we can 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.640
 use text projection but 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.260
 remember that this is an option 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.970
 which is redundant from this phone already 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.119
 that we would have two keyboard options 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.830
 physical keyboard and screen keyboard 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.020
 as you will see immediately the key comes out 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.479
 on the screen that is to say we have two 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.130
 keyboards on 1 phone which would not have 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:09.040
 soon felt but the only way 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.640
 use the tek tek the projective text 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.280
 tail 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.380
 world as they were there yes we can already do 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.130
 use of the effective text 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.130
 how 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.050
 how is it 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.120
 that simple, we can use the 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.910
 effective text keeping in mind that 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.830
 we must activate the on-screen keyboard and 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.380
 especially by study many times 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.860
 videos I invite you to subscribe again to
