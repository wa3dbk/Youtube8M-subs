00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:23.350 
knows how to make head pins you just

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:25.650 
knows how to make head pins you just
melt<00:00:23.560> the<00:00:23.710> end<00:00:23.860> of<00:00:23.980> the<00:00:24.070> wire<00:00:24.250> and<00:00:24.670> there's<00:00:25.510> a

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:25.660 
melt the end of the wire and there's a

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.870 
melt the end of the wire and there's a
bead<00:00:27.060> by<00:00:28.060> what<00:00:28.510> I'm<00:00:28.600> going<00:00:28.810> to<00:00:28.840> do<00:00:28.990> is<00:00:29.880> flatten

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
want to get it down to about the

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.469 
want to get it down to about the
thickness<00:00:45.789> of<00:00:46.179> the<00:00:46.329> wire<00:00:47.940> need<00:00:48.940> a<00:00:49.030> couple<00:00:49.389> of

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:49.479 
thickness of the wire need a couple of

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:56.279

them so like I said I just smack it down

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:58.049 
them so like I said I just smack it down
to<00:00:56.739> where<00:00:56.949> it's<00:00:57.100> about<00:00:57.309> the<00:00:57.489> same<00:00:57.729> thing<00:00:58.030> to

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059 
to where it's about the same thing to

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:01.139 
to where it's about the same thing to
sue<00:00:58.299> the<00:00:58.420> wire<00:00:58.569> that's<00:00:58.749> about<00:00:59.399> 20<00:01:00.399> gauge<00:01:00.609> or<00:01:00.940> so

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:01.149 
sue the wire that's about 20 gauge or so

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:06.179 
sue the wire that's about 20 gauge or so
wire<00:01:02.010> 30,000<00:01:04.110> now<00:01:05.110> you<00:01:05.170> never<00:01:05.500> know<00:01:05.740> make<00:01:06.039> an

wire 30,000 now you never know make an

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:15.370 
wire 30,000 now you never know make an
extra<00:01:06.430> one<00:01:06.700> I<00:01:08.549> might<00:01:09.549> mess<00:01:09.759> it<00:01:09.789> up

head pin right in the middle there and

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.539 
head pin right in the middle there and
punch<00:01:50.030> it<00:01:50.209> out<00:01:50.860> you<00:01:51.860> can<00:01:51.890> keep<00:01:52.220> the<00:01:52.429> little

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
piece that you punched out if you're

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:56.800 
piece that you punched out if you're
saving<00:01:54.349> your<00:01:54.500> butt<00:01:54.819> metal<00:01:55.819> after<00:01:56.539> all<00:01:56.599> this<00:01:56.750> is

saving your butt metal after all this is
pure<00:01:57.229> silver<00:01:58.929> so<00:02:00.280> it's<00:02:01.280> a<00:02:01.310> little<00:02:01.520> sticky

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
pure silver so it's a little sticky

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.350 
pure silver so it's a little sticky
coming<00:02:02.209> off<00:02:03.580> sometimes<00:02:04.580> I<00:02:04.700> break<00:02:04.909> them<00:02:05.060> doing

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
coming off sometimes I break them doing

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.789 
coming off sometimes I break them doing
that<00:02:05.390> if<00:02:05.689> I<00:02:05.840> wiggle<00:02:06.170> them<00:02:06.259> around<00:02:06.289> too<00:02:06.709> much<00:02:07.539> so

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:08.799 
that if I wiggle them around too much so

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:12.130 
that if I wiggle them around too much so
I've<00:02:09.799> got<00:02:10.069> an<00:02:10.220> old<00:02:10.369> pair<00:02:10.489> of<00:02:10.819> cutters<00:02:11.140> less

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
I've got an old pair of cutters less

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:18.670 
I've got an old pair of cutters less
cuts<00:02:13.090> that<00:02:14.090> I<00:02:14.120> can<00:02:15.849> reach<00:02:16.849> in<00:02:17.150> and<00:02:17.380> pry<00:02:18.380> it<00:02:18.440> off

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
cuts that I can reach in and pry it off

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.819 
cuts that I can reach in and pry it off
so<00:02:19.010> you'll<00:02:19.190> notice<00:02:20.230> it's<00:02:21.230> not<00:02:21.440> coming<00:02:21.650> off

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:21.829 
so you'll notice it's not coming off

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:24.520 
so you'll notice it's not coming off
real<00:02:22.100> easily<00:02:22.600> so<00:02:23.600> here<00:02:23.900> come<00:02:24.140> the<00:02:24.319> plush

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
real easily so here come the plush

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.640 
real easily so here come the plush
cutters<00:02:24.890> I<00:02:26.500> just<00:02:27.500> lay<00:02:27.650> them<00:02:27.769> down<00:02:29.470> right<00:02:30.470> next

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
cutters I just lay them down right next

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:38.430 
cutters I just lay them down right next
to<00:02:30.859> the<00:02:30.980> edge<00:02:31.069> and<00:02:31.400> roll<00:02:31.730> up<00:02:32.170> pry<00:02:33.170> it<00:02:33.319> off<00:02:36.940> and
