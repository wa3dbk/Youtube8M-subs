a battlefield spinoff that should be

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.630

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
rotation at least for a little bit so

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.470 
rotation at least for a little bit so
that<00:00:34.200> left<00:00:34.770> room<00:00:35.130> for<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.460> brand<00:00:35.850> new<00:00:36.000> shooter

that left room for a brand new shooter
to<00:00:37.050> come<00:00:37.290> in<00:00:37.620> now<00:00:38.129> EA<00:00:38.399> has<00:00:38.579> said<00:00:39.149> in<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.300> past

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
to come in now EA has said in the past

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.680 
to come in now EA has said in the past
they<00:00:39.840> didn't<00:00:40.110> plan<00:00:40.320> on<00:00:40.469> annualizing<00:00:41.370> the

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
they didn't plan on annualizing the

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.119 
they didn't plan on annualizing the
battlefield<00:00:42.690> series<00:00:42.960> which<00:00:43.320> of<00:00:43.559> course<00:00:43.620> that

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
battlefield series which of course that

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.040 
battlefield series which of course that
means<00:00:44.309> that<00:00:44.670> this<00:00:44.910> game<00:00:45.149> probably<00:00:45.480> won't<00:00:45.899> be

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
means that this game probably won't be

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.459 
means that this game probably won't be
battlefield<00:00:46.620> 5<00:00:46.980> but<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:48.690> see<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:48.930> spin-off

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
battlefield 5 but to see a spin-off

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.220 
battlefield 5 but to see a spin-off
which<00:00:50.070> is<00:00:50.280> what<00:00:50.640> this<00:00:50.850> is<00:00:51.059> being<00:00:51.300> called<00:00:51.690> then

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
which is what this is being called then

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.139 
which is what this is being called then
that<00:00:52.500> way<00:00:52.710> they<00:00:52.890> could<00:00:52.949> still<00:00:53.250> work<00:00:53.489> around<00:00:53.940> it

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
that way they could still work around it

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.799 
that way they could still work around it
and<00:00:54.329> they<00:00:54.930> also<00:00:55.199> say<00:00:55.710> if<00:00:55.739> one<00:00:56.399> is<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:57.000> come<00:00:57.239> then

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
and they also say if one is to come then

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.170 
and they also say if one is to come then
it's<00:00:57.989> not<00:00:58.230> going<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.680> be<00:00:58.800> developed<00:00:59.280> by<00:00:59.789> dice

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
it's not going to be developed by dice

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.049 
it's not going to be developed by dice
so<00:01:00.899> last<00:01:01.289> year<00:01:01.500> Michael<00:01:02.250> Pachter<00:01:02.460> he<00:01:02.760> came<00:01:02.940> out

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
so last year Michael Pachter he came out

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.119 
so last year Michael Pachter he came out
he<00:01:03.239> said<00:01:03.570> even<00:01:03.780> though<00:01:04.049> EA<00:01:04.290> has<00:01:04.619> yet<00:01:04.949> to

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
he said even though EA has yet to

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.950 
he said even though EA has yet to
announce<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.580> game<00:01:05.790> he<00:01:06.180> thinks<00:01:06.570> there<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:06.780> a

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960

battlefield spinoff that is coming and

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.550 
battlefield spinoff that is coming and
then<00:01:10.049> this<00:01:10.560> week<00:01:10.950> polygon<00:01:11.820> reported<00:01:12.479> that<00:01:12.990> EA

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
then this week polygon reported that EA

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.399 
then this week polygon reported that EA
was<00:01:14.040> actually<00:01:14.939> letting<00:01:15.299> go<00:01:15.630> of<00:01:15.659> some

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
was actually letting go of some

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.039 
was actually letting go of some
contractors<00:01:17.189> who<00:01:17.369> were<00:01:17.400> working<00:01:17.670> on<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.360> new

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
contractors who were working on a new

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.920 
contractors who were working on a new
need<00:01:19.290> for<00:01:19.320> speed<00:01:19.560> game<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.369> so<00:01:21.119> they<00:01:21.869> were

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
need for speed game and so they were

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.899 
need for speed game and so they were
asked<00:01:22.619> if<00:01:22.770> they<00:01:22.799> wanted<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.369> go<00:01:23.490> home<00:01:23.729> they

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
asked if they wanted to go home they

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.640 
asked if they wanted to go home they
could<00:01:24.060> take<00:01:24.210> some<00:01:24.420> pay<00:01:24.600> or<00:01:24.840> they<00:01:25.470> could

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
could take some pay or they could

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.789 
could take some pay or they could
actually<00:01:25.860> go<00:01:26.340> work<00:01:26.640> with<00:01:26.930> visceral<00:01:27.930> on<00:01:28.259> the

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
actually go work with visceral on the

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.760 
actually go work with visceral on the
brand<00:01:29.070> new<00:01:29.280> battlefield<00:01:29.880> game<00:01:30.210> which<00:01:30.780> is<00:01:30.810> what

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
brand new battlefield game which is what

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.700 
brand new battlefield game which is what
they<00:01:31.950> call<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.460> police<00:01:33.090> themed<00:01:33.710> battlefield

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
they call a police themed battlefield

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.090 
they call a police themed battlefield
spin-off<00:01:35.369> game<00:01:35.640> so<00:01:36.299> what<00:01:36.840> that<00:01:36.869> exactly<00:01:37.409> means

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
spin-off game so what that exactly means

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.580 
spin-off game so what that exactly means
we're<00:01:38.759> not<00:01:38.790> sure<00:01:39.329> you<00:01:39.810> know<00:01:39.930> whenever<00:01:40.140> I<00:01:40.290> think

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
we're not sure you know whenever I think

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.620 
we're not sure you know whenever I think
of<00:01:40.770> police<00:01:41.220> games<00:01:41.549> first<00:01:42.090> thing<00:01:42.270> that<00:01:42.420> comes

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
of police games first thing that comes

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.179 
of police games first thing that comes
to<00:01:42.750> mind<00:01:42.960> is<00:01:43.229> something<00:01:43.740> like<00:01:43.950> you<00:01:44.159> know

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
to mind is something like you know

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.789 
to mind is something like you know
Rainbow<00:01:44.729> six<00:01:45.149> or<00:01:45.420> something<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.290> that<00:01:46.320> effect

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
Rainbow six or something to that effect

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.789 
Rainbow six or something to that effect
so<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.040> have<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.310> frostbite<00:01:47.939> 3<00:01:48.180> engine<00:01:48.680> you<00:01:49.680> know

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
so to have a frostbite 3 engine you know

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.920 
so to have a frostbite 3 engine you know
battlefield<00:01:50.340> originally<00:01:51.329> it's<00:01:51.509> always

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
battlefield originally it's always

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.109 
battlefield originally it's always
seemed<00:01:52.710> like<00:01:52.920> it's<00:01:53.100> always<00:01:53.250> been<00:01:53.399> bigger<00:01:53.820> maps

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
seemed like it's always been bigger maps

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.450 
seemed like it's always been bigger maps
but<00:01:54.420> it<00:01:54.570> seems<00:01:54.930> like<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.290> last<00:01:55.500> few<00:01:56.159> games

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
but it seems like the last few games

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.760 
but it seems like the last few games
they've<00:01:57.149> been<00:01:57.390> getting<00:01:57.719> more<00:01:57.899> close<00:01:57.960> quarters

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
they've been getting more close quarters

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.010 
they've been getting more close quarters
at<00:01:59.340> least<00:01:59.610> with<00:01:59.790> some<00:01:59.969> of<00:02:00.060> their<00:02:00.180> packages<00:02:00.810> and

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
at least with some of their packages and

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.899 
at least with some of their packages and
they're<00:02:01.560> really<00:02:01.860> trying<00:02:02.040> to<00:02:02.219> tap<00:02:02.490> into<00:02:02.729> I

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
they're really trying to tap into I

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.389 
they're really trying to tap into I
think<00:02:03.270> that<00:02:03.450> call<00:02:03.659> of<00:02:03.810> duty<00:02:04.110> time<00:02:04.500> crowd<00:02:04.890> now

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
think that call of duty time crowd now

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.399 
think that call of duty time crowd now
