00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.420
 happy for ciccio caputo born under the 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.830
 curve ap you hug the set the wrists 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.200
 I think he deserves it all 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.830
 and let 's say the 12 call guy is why 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:21.360
 I said I hope in the goal of caputo 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:23.930
 this is the ciccio caputo rule 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.930
 you feel it 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.120
 but look, I know who I am 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.520
 trained all hidden but every bit up 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:40.160
 in the last days in the summer and I know it 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:44.210
 but I'm fine and I enjoy the moment 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.210
 I want to continue on this path 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:51.420
 no there is much agreement between the peaks one 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.430
 natural thing 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.890
 we will surely improve this area 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.050
 even those others who are in pain 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.600
 times the newcomer 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:04.770
 if then second on this road there 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:09.240
 we can have fun for a striker ago 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:09.960
 always enjoys important we wanted to do 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.850
 goals 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.910
 surely I also care about the de luca c 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.560
 topics were also held there, however others 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.990
 on the list the first rigorist from 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.890
 Minister then it was my turn 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.890
 happy for the goal 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:29.420
 I hope to make more 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:32.240
 there is a desire for anger in those who 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:35.120
 he was close to me and knows what I want 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.580
 give then for me it will talk only about the 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:44.810
 camp can the rest for me do not count from 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:47.570
 suck over that I was very loaded and 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.670
 I will always be charged, however, as I said 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.990
 before the mister makes a list 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:55.190
 then the first on the list is the yo 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.170
 normal that he cared about is he too 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:00.080
 what forward at home with a team 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:05.990
 important though it went so okay 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:07.760
 so we are a little suffering i 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:12.590
 workloads because it is a period 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:14.840
 that we have loaded enough playing 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:19.610
 at home I do n't know how many in front 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:21.250
 spectators against an important team 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:25.380
 eventually the stimuli come on their own 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:28.080
 But we did a great race 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.530
 we have interpreted it in the best way 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.790
 and in the world that the coach asked us 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:36.120
 we must continue on this path on 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.550
 maximum with all sincerity 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.710
 the new ones are inserted great from 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.980
 group 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:45.180
 is that this is our strength have 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.210
 I got it 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:51.660
 the atmosphere the environment that is here a 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:53.700
 several come here with great desire and 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.320
 great will then entered 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:59.940
 very well these also our luck 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:02.940
 we train day by day 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:06.390
 to conquer the opposite then mixed that 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.280
 makes some definitely baroque choices 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.740
 lived two important years and with him 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:14.140
 so before being a player one 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:19.090
 so great friend still I feel then 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:21.130
 it would be a billiard stroke, however, these 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.380
 things it is not up to me to say then it will be the 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.650
 company to make evaluations 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.650
 here 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:37.300
 according to me the field that makes then see 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:37.300
 so here he is, ciccio caputo, you hear it
