that you have running since where this
comes<00:00:42.420> into<00:00:42.660> play<00:00:42.840> so<00:00:43.500> start<00:00:43.890> Borderlands<00:00:44.430> 2

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:45.289

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:49.279 
comes into play so start Borderlands 2
go<00:00:46.289> into<00:00:46.530> settings<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.690> I<00:00:48.690> recommend<00:00:49.079> that

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
go into settings and I recommend that

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.250 
go into settings and I recommend that
you<00:00:49.379> turn<00:00:49.620> windowed<00:00:50.010> mode<00:00:50.219> on<00:00:50.870> just<00:00:51.870> because

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
you turn windowed mode on just because

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.299 
you turn windowed mode on just because
it<00:00:52.800> makes<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.850> easier<00:00:54.770> you<00:00:55.770> can<00:00:55.920> turn<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.129> off

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
it makes it easier you can turn it off

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:05.800 
it makes it easier you can turn it off
later<00:00:56.610> book<00:00:57.500> and<00:00:58.640> then<00:00:59.640> hit<00:00:59.850> play

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.480 

so<00:01:06.649> once<00:01:06.829> the<00:01:06.979> game<00:01:07.189> is<00:01:07.220> running<00:01:09.310> just<00:01:10.310> wait

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
so once the game is running just wait

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:18.819 
so once the game is running just wait
for<00:01:10.700> this<00:01:16.659> all<00:01:17.659> right<00:01:17.810> so<00:01:18.049> you<00:01:18.530> want<00:01:18.649> to<00:01:18.710> move
