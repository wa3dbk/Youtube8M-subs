River
I<00:00:20.359> think<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.449> easiest<00:00:21.660> way<00:00:21.840> to<00:00:21.869> get<00:00:22.050> you<00:00:22.199> would

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
I think the easiest way to get you would

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.950 
I think the easiest way to get you would
probably<00:00:22.890> be<00:00:23.010> just<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:23.430> fast<00:00:23.699> travel<00:00:26.599> cool<00:00:27.599> and

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
probably be just to fast travel cool and

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.259 
probably be just to fast travel cool and
