00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.649
 hi to all and governed explained then 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.120
 today I explained to you a tour 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.040
 with cards that is very easy 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.059
 automatic then we lose no time 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.589
 I'll go right away 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.219
 tour demonstration and then to 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:16.820
 explanations 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.820
 here we go 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:23.960
 [Music] 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.800
 so for this turn I need a game of 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:30.980
 normal map like this is entirely 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.510
 mix of course that's it I'll even the 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.090
 gave to mix before starting the 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.950
 turn to the spectators it's important that 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.130
 the viewer mixes well the game of 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.130
 cards 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.620
 once again the game mix well on 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:47.390
 can ask viewers to take 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.020
 any map for example 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:54.350
 this one sees there and I'm going to 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:58.510
 ask to memorize hilda sure I do not 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:03.260
 do not look at it I hope it's good 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:05.360
 like these is then I ask them 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.590
 simply on the top of the game and 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:11.660
 there I am going to cut the game like this 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.759
 so here I can directly search 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.290
 the viewer's map but for me 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:18.259
 complicate the task i'm going to ask him 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:21.380
 to cut the game as many times as he 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:23.899
 desire is really anywhere so 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:27.530
 here is the spectator couple game like 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:29.479
 these many times and so here is a 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.180
 times the game cut well so I'm going 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:36.560
 try to find the map of 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:39.189
 viewer so I think it could 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.189
 to be that 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:49.990
 why pass the a and this one too 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:52.780
 like this then in these three cards 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:56.560
 I'm sure there is a map 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.810
 of the viewer and slaughter holds everything 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.909
 simply actually I think rather than 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.950
 the spectator's map is a map to 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.289
 heart and there is only one knows 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.570
 the 3 of heart so we will remove the 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:09.910
 tiles and now I can you 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:13.330
 affirm that the spectator's map and 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.800
 the 3 of heart here we go all of 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.830
 following the explanations of this round of 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.830
 magic 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.599
 [Music] 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.180
 so as I said at the beginning of the 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.050
 video it's a very simple trick and this 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.850
 which is good is that it is totally 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.740
 automatic which means there is no 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:30.940
 no need for preparation so for the 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.490
 do you need a card game 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.350
 totally normal and mix of course 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.850
 like this here we will even ask 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.260
 before starting the tour so at 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.490
 spectators mixing game that's 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.160
 still important enough 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.180
 that's like these once it's 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.370
 do you just have him 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.540
 ask to choose a map 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.680
 which can really take that 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.470
 that he wants so 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.880
 imagine this one he has memories so 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.160
 there as we are in the explanations we 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.380
 will look at the map so the viewer 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.530
 but mauritius leroy two tiles and 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.720
 while she memorizes her card you 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.340
 just go watch the 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.110
 last map of the game so in 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.320
 the occurrence there is the 2 of heart 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.730
 then you even use this card without 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.500
 that the spectator does not see us so he 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.020
 will have to do it while he 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.310
 memorize the card he has chosen and you 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.720
 can do it naturally by 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:19.300
 example by flipping your wrist 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.430
 like this or by passing the game 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.530
 like these from one hand to another 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.270
 here is where you memorize the heart 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.740
 and like this between the index and middle finger 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:30.220
 you put my heart visual 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:32.380
 so then once you even yourself 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.570
 liked - and that of heart you go 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.670
 ask the audience to rest the 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:39.340
 card so his card on top of the game 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.560
 and then you can cut the game 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.680
 like this because by cutting you go 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.840
 put the card you have memorize 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:49.150
 years old above the viewer's map 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.090
 and so after that we will only have 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.650
 find the map we were going to 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.360
 morizet 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.300
 so here in this case the heart 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:01.150
 like these and we'll just have to 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:03.220
 look at the map before the heart so 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.800
 here in this case the king of diamonds is 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:08.740
 so now we will be that our famous 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.400
 king of diamonds and the card chosen by 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.160
 the spectator 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.930
 but to keep a little suspense on 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.610
 will not go out like that the 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.920
 map of spectators but we go in 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:19.900
 go out two or three more years like this 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.320
 so we start to evoke the game of 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.760
 cards 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.460
 we take out a card randomly saying ah 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.690
 I think it could be that one 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.750
 then 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.580
 we will fall on the famous heart 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.840
 that we have memorized so we know that the 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.140
 spectator card is the king of 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.850
 tile 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:35.070
 we say it could be this one and 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.450
 you come out one last saying 

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.580
 that it could be that one too 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:40.050
 can get out 4 but I'm leaving 3 I 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.230
 finds that it is already largely 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:45.660
 enough like this then we spread 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:48.360
 the three cards saying spectators 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:51.330
 bacon is confident that his card is doing 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.860
 part of these three cards there so of the 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.560
 month according to the configuration of the cards 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.670
 I could say for example knowing 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.710
 that the spectator map on the right 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:00.750
 tile simply I think your 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.370
 card and a red card and so I 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.450
 remove the two black cards like this 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.940
 here 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:07.800
 and so here now I can assert 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:09.690
 to the audience that his card is a king 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:13.200
 so tiao has it's up to you to invent 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:16.920
 your text for to make your little 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:18.930
 mentalism game like this so 

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:21.300
 now you can really say 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:23.580
 that you have found the map of 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.230
 spectator that's all for the 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.760
 explanations so that sings them this 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:28.470
 video if you liked this trick 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.730
 do not hesitate to leave a gem and a 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.210
 comment to tell me what you 

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:31.950
 have thought 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:33.510
 I'll see you soon for a 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:35.610
 next magic trick with an object 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.540
 this time and I wish you too 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.250
 very happy holidays 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:49.330
 See you 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:49.330
