00:00:10.109 --> 00:00:13.189
 However, it has not become an indisputable reference in the sector 

00:00:13.189 --> 00:00:17.499
 railway industry thanks to its innovative pioneering zeal in bad weather 

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:20.499
 face challenges such as the different path widths 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.689
 at the end of the 19th century the different states and nations began to realize 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:29.630
 the facilities of its railway layout lisin shorten the distance 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:31.759
 country standards 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:32.710
 that's why 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.219
 that at present we find several widths of track 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.890
 among those who are archive said international standard width and width 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.220
 Russian 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.979
 when the train arrives at the border 

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:46.299
 the passengers had to transport from a train a gauge other 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.830
 in the same way the load is transferred 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.830
 with the consequent loss of effort and money time 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.800
 with the idea of ​​solving this problem 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.709
 in 1966 

00:00:58.709 --> 00:01:02.329
 the international union of railways convened a contest of ideas with the 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:05.720
 condition that the proposals were made on shafts with open wheels 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.729
 considering that they were normal train projects I go out 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.539
 was presented out of competition with its system of changing width called 

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:15.920
 prd displaceable wheels 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.299
 based precisely on the variation of this distance without any kind of 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:21.000
 risk has derailed 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.220
 talgo received the special mention for its innovative project just three years 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.130
 then in June 1969 the system of change of width came into service 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.310
 rb that is applied regularly in commercial passenger trains 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.130
 the talgo international barcelona geneva 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.469
 only the change of locomotive was enough for travelers 

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:45.990
 could finish the journey sitting the same seats which meant all 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.990
 a revolution in the railway circulation 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.030
 in the year 1995 I leave developed the application of this system the axes of 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.030
 wagons of goods in anticipation of a large potential market 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.999
 between the European Union the countries of Eastern Europe and the forwards 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.490
 This development made it possible for the end of the 1990s to apply the 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:09.569
 rbc system 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.810
 to the extractors of the locomotives 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.719
 used in talgo 21 high speed trains in diesel oil sk versions 

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:19.719
 and in the talgo 250 electric 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:23.389
 the system of change of width talgo de revenga 

00:02:23.389 --> 00:02:26.540
 it consists of a process that is carried out automatically 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.179
 to the passage of the train at a speed of 10 or 15 kilometers per hour 

00:02:30.179 --> 00:02:33.699
 on an installation of change of width mounted entrevías of different 

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:35.039
 wide hours 

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:38.369
 the procedure consists of five phases 

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:42.279
 in the first phase as the train advances without changing the seat level of the 

00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:42.869
 traveler 

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:44.959
 the weight of the wheels is discarded 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.269
 the skates come in contact with the tracks and slid on 

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:56.069
 in a second phase the feet of the bolts that block laterally the 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.669
 sets of wheels are introduced in guides and descend as the 

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:00.499
 train advances 

00:03:00.499 --> 00:03:03.199
 bound by the slope of these guides 

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:06.219
 the sets of big wheels in dives and free to move 

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:09.219
 sideways 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:11.110
 in the third phase 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.360
 the wheels following some lateral tracks 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.620
 they move transversely to the position of the new track width 

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:22.699
 The fourth phase is characterized by the fixing of the wheels in its new 

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:23.459
 position 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.459
 thanks to the locks that go back up 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:33.049
 for the fifth and last phase the wheels come into contact with the 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.799
 new way and begin to roll taking the load of the train to continue its 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:39.799
 trip 

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:44.399
 the talgo system of networks of change of width supposes a series of clear and 

00:03:44.399 --> 00:03:48.619
 remarkable advantages decreases logistic cycles and therefore the 

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:51.729
 freight price 

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:56.169
 increases the capacity to transport all types of materials by railroad up to 

00:03:56.169 --> 00:03:59.989
 the actual capacity of the line without having to consider the facilities 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:02.579
 at border points 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:06.159
 Both travelers with goods make their project more comfortable without need 

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:09.489
 to transfer 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:12.949
 solves the problem of bottlenecks at border points with 

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:15.019
 double track width 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:18.970
 allows a greater flow of goods and passengers between the east and west of 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:19.570
 Europe 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.570
 and between the Mediterranean and the Baltic 

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:27.309
 resolves in a decisive way the problems inherent in the crossings of 

00:04:27.309 --> 00:04:30.539
 Railway border of the corridors go to Europeans and Eurasians 

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:36.129
 decreases the cost of border facilities for the expected growth 

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:39.129
 of the flow of goods transports 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.699
 In Spain we have exchange facilities not only on the border with 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:47.569
 france clotet something applies its network system in irun reported 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.020
 it is also used in the change for conventional gauge 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.689
 Iberian today high speed 

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:56.789
 so we have the facilities of madrid 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:01.190
 córdoba seville bobadilla plasencia of milestone and roda de bara 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:05.749
 other new width change facilities are being installed in different 

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:08.749
 points of the Spanish network 

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:15.139
 In Europe talgo technology is applied on trains arriving at montpelier 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.039
 berna dylan iztúris 

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:23.800
 In recent years, system tests have been carried out under conditions 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.800
 extreme weather in sweden finland and russia for the change of 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.800
 Russian width to international standard with satisfactory result 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:36.210
 in kazakhstan 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.550
 one of the talgo trains of the railway administration caf a jade 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.479
 million and has the network system for changing the Russian width to the 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:46.479
 the Chinese People's Republic identical to the international standard 

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:52.699
 the power of innovation the experience and millions of changes of 

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:57.179
 width made without incidents guarantee the talgo rd width change system 

00:05:57.839 --> 00:06:01.129
 The only system in the world that has been operating for more than 40 years 

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:04.129
 commercial 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.510
 one of the latest achievements of this application 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:10.000
 it has occurred in the Spanish high speed 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.600
 creating total interoperability with the start-up of two years of 

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.600
 different roads and two electrification systems 

00:06:18.029 --> 00:06:20.449
 this new breakthrough of the resale system 

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:24.189
 has already been incorporated into the latest projects that Talgo developed for the 

00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:25.400
 high speed 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:30.199
 The first electric locomotive bars in the world with this application and the 

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:32.610
