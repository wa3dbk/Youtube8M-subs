once you've completed your show use an
eyepin<00:02:00.420> I<00:02:00.570> made<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.260> mistake<00:02:01.680> of<00:02:01.710> using<00:02:02.130> a

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
eyepin I made the mistake of using a

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.640 
eyepin I made the mistake of using a
flat<00:02:02.490> head<00:02:02.520> pin<00:02:03.090> but<00:02:03.510> there<00:02:04.020> was<00:02:04.140> still<00:02:04.409> room

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
flat head pin but there was still room

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.940 
flat head pin but there was still room
to<00:02:04.710> switch<00:02:05.130> pinned<00:02:05.490> later<00:02:06.080> but<00:02:07.080> use<00:02:07.650> an<00:02:07.799> eye

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
to switch pinned later but use an eye

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.040 
to switch pinned later but use an eye
pin<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.520> then<00:02:09.000> sandwich<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.569> two<00:02:09.750> shelves

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
pin and then sandwich the two shelves

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.530 
pin and then sandwich the two shelves
together<00:02:10.470> between<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.670> pin<00:02:11.940> and<00:02:12.180> bake

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
together between the pin and bake

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.449 
together between the pin and bake
next<00:02:15.540> take<00:02:16.050> your<00:02:16.080> otter<00:02:16.440> and<00:02:16.739> insert<00:02:17.130> a<00:02:17.160> flat

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
next take your otter and insert a flat
