00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 hello everyone asked a video about macros 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.299
 write the question as I explained 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:11.549
 to your friends and all sorts of jokes 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:13.750
 frills open the editor 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:15.599
 The settings for this are crazy now 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.300
 probably 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:23.050
 programming go through the interface 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:25.900
 button name here are three different mods 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.500
 colors you can switch from one 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.289
 profile 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.670
 but here those save test these buttons 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:32.380
 This is described later 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.620
 along the way 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:39.760
 First, let's look at the difference between 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:41.710
 macro button this let's go here well 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.260
 here are additional commands here 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.400
 disable macros or buttons so honestly 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:50.030
 take fast 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:53.710
 macro until we click click ok click 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:58.250
 test now press the button and the speed is still 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:01:03.460
 see see one click well under 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.460
 Hold for 2 longer and I will hold 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:10.820
 this is how the button works now see 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:14.690
 Now I’ll change it to a macro. See what 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.030
 the floor will turn out but just click quickly and 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:20.440
 let go 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:22.850
 After all, he prints himself as if the difference 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.340
 knows how to use it somehow 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.550
 with your programming now 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:34.170
 create a new live there indulge 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:38.380
 click new without a name 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.810
 new extra team will go 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.550
 on the fields the top title 2 note that 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.550
 will be issued at the touch of a button what 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.170
 will be issued when you hold the button 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.380
 the bottom is what will be issued in 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.880
 computer when you release the button 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.250
 further record of the mouse too now 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.730
 let's see just click whales buttons 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:00.660
 he writes it all down to edit 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:02.740
 walkie talkie this field can only mouse 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.430
 the keys here doesn't work because she 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.400
 reads 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:10.330
 all that you press if you select all 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:14.740
 work out also if you want here 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:16.620
 edit gaming come 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.060
 press a button there you like it 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:23.590
 set the delay add there 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:25.960
 delay now let's say so much she 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.630
 changed added delay also 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:33.460
 Well, all buttons can be time calibration 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:36.280
 make let's say everything will be 200 then 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.200
 there will be 0 and 200,000 in two hundred 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.140
 two hundred and two hundred and two hundred 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:46.350
 this is macro one, I'll show you 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.350
 the bug set me up for count of duty 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.690
 sight hold breath when i hold 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.750
 it's all pressed release the button it's all 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:03:00.959
 goes down so did this one of 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.959
 options that can be made to go 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:15.130
 we go but here we will help let's say 123 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:26.830
 click ok where the aw test press hold 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:31.720
 gives 23 save give name click 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:34.300
 we will have a safe here click on it 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.340
 he activated principle could 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.450
 activate from here performed 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:45.550
 activated checked can be inserted 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:46.230
 let's say macro team guides hot 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:50.080
 keys 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:53.140
 here you can also use the list 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:54.820
 then look let's wander around 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:04:00.850
 on the internet you can use these 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:03.370
 buttons and so on is another such thing 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.709
 in programs in games that requires 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:09.670
 response from the server macro sometimes they 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:12.489
 work for example if you make a macro 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:15.190
 for counter strike for double zoom 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:16.200
 it doesn’t work as if you are new 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.930
 for gasoline 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:23.800
 zoom doesn't work because 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:25.870
 It turns out such a thing that the game sends 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.419
 command to the server and waiting for a response from 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.729
 server and server comes depending on 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:34.330
 what's your ping and how would you 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:37.930
 it is necessary to set the delay and the delay is not 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:40.479
 guess and shorter well does not work if you 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:43.240
 trying to double zoom immediately with 

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:48.400
 the buttons on the counter will not work I 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:51.729
 checked does not work minus but as it is 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:55.510
 so there is now on the back side 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:57.190
 let's see what we can not 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:00.460
 I am always programmed to use 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:03.430
 programmed it works directly everything 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.990
 it stop principle the same 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.690
 sensitivity can sensitivity 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.750
 adjust if you want sensitivity 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:12.820
 it was permissible vertical 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:16.000
 more or less who have such fun 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:18.669
 there is and they use if you know how 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.729
 use use basically this 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:22.529
 everything here is particularly such 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:24.830
 any special complexity or frills 

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:24.830
 no on
