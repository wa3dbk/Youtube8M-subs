00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:07.040
 the part where we already did it 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.040
 what is your name 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:12.080
 to keep the little tricks 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:14.930
 to save the threads and we did it 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.360
 golden and the truth this cross would have 

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.610
 liked or gold or copper color and 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.880
 as we said the other in gold as 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:24.710
 better with the copper to see 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.380
 different tones to see the 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:30.529
 variety as though this is a 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:34.040
 craft with clothespins then if you 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:35.870
 you put one such a nice detail there 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.000
 it has to be rustic 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.990
 look here for example please do not 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.300
 stop giving it inside 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:47.360
 and as I said, not because it's something 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.890
 rustic has to stay good for 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.810
 example to me there are rustic things that I 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.080
 they love but others that not so much 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:56.420
 then this does not have to be left 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:59.960
 precisely everything you do with this 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.540
 technique of the visits of clothes that do not 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.700
 you have to give everything rustic 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:09.590
 we already saw the little frog 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.590
 that we were also very nice 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:16.660
 nothing else is a matter of having 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:20.590
 a little creativity and patience 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:23.560
 while alone as it goes lifting the 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.210
 truth is very very beautiful and I turn them 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.030
 to repeat if for example you do these 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.860
 Christmas gifts for your family 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.840
 how much can you spend the truth with 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:36.840
 a bag of clothespins 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.789
 how many crosses are not going to come out 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.210
 and as I told you if you do not want to buy the 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:46.259
 cardboard illustration with a box 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.119
 Hard cookie lights or whatever 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.990
 because the play dough and the play dough 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:54.500
 daia the cardboard below hardens 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.119
 quite also already with the glue 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.680
 then the only thing that we are that is 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.620
 something stiff 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.710
 you do not need to make a cumbersome expense and 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:08.500
 then you can give away 20-30 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:12.360
 You cross all your family to all 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.360
 brothers to all cousins 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.100
 what a beautiful memory 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.850
 or as I tell you about your first communion 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:26.940
 when I was chama with a 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:29.280
 little friend imagine if it was good girl 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.970
 a little friend made her first communion and 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.720
 they precisely gave crosses 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.720
 of memory 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:41.580
 of these if you can winnow that you 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:44.970
 like about 100 or 200 and it will not weigh you 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.420
 both the cost and other memories if 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.720
 dices 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.940
 God forgive me the memory and I can 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.160
 remember but for three years for the 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.540
 cost that I had and that I had to be 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.540
 paying off the cards 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:06.780
 and we finished in seven minutes 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.780
 just 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:19.840
 look how beautiful it looks 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:23.560
 the truth that the beautiful pity that not 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:26.240
 I know you can not appreciate 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.810
 too all all all all 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.810
 details 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:35.270
 but in truth 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:38.660
 it stays looking with the light that to very 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:41.670
 father so metallic because he put a 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:44.940
 metallic copper color then it remains 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:47.250
 look very nice and how long have we 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.680
 we miss that I touch a bit for the 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.770
 details all that but you can 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.140
 do much faster ok then good 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:57.690
 I hope you liked it if you liked it 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.459
