00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 hello you love the year 2014 is 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.000
 I hope you are all good in there 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:07.680
 new year slipped 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.330
 and I thought I'll show you 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.840
 Just the products I have 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.089
 yes , I really enjoyed using and 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.859
 which I have tested for a long time so that 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.670
 I'll give you a real meal too 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.410
 can give 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.880
 and yes, I would be easy in the beginning 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.730
 make the first product that I you 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.080
 want to show is from ballet and indeed 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.810
 is that the ph neutral wash lotions 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.179
 for the face this also for sensitive ones 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.710
 skin and I have to say that since then I 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.360
 she wants to use herself with skin 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.760
 really refined so i do not get it 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.899
 more as fast as before and I know 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.879
 not really synonymous of this product 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.160
 but I come with it superbe glass 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.960
 does not irritate my skin and yes me 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.100
 Use is really only everyone 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.680
 evening to make-up 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.020
 and that's why it's an absolute favorite 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.059
 for me the next product I have 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.070
 But I did not gain weight until the summer 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.710
 already half empty 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.590
 I regret that very much and I did 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:02.430
 me 100 milliliters of the fragrance avalanche 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.290
 bought from lancome and i love this one 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.540
 Just smell as you can see I have it 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.640
 really worn almost every day and that 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.439
 is simply holy and if it is 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.180
 I just go shopping because I am 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.680
 love it 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.049
 next, a product which her on 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.340
 You've seen youtube so many times 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.110
 you probably can not 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.490
 see more and although I speak of those 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.259
 biowarm sensitive h2o facial water that 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.509
 I always use it after I have the 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.700
 had used this nut here and this 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.590
 I love both products together 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.820
 easy so i have this year this 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.040
 product no longer is wegdenken 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.420
 Of course not quite so cheap but me 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.049
 I have to say I really like it totally 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.990
 with pleasure 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.799
 There is a drugstore of I believe 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.290
 l'oreal 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.000
 I also used an ewf 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.070
 but it is nowhere near as good as 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.200
 this one here at l'oreal 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.320
 my skin is really very much after that 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.060
 dry and irritated and bio 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.829
 denner it is not like that at all 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.600
 needs gets the way, in pharmacy 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.219
 or even with amazon it is sometimes 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.149
 even cheaper you get linked 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:04.799
 downstairs if I find it 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:06.390
 and yes this hand cream from loks itan is 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.310
 not to imagine without me 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.899
 I already have different ones 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.460
 tried directions now 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:17.580
 this neutral direction can 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:20.040
 that means in any case the 20 is there 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:23.640
 in there and is just extra for dry 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:26.790
 lokus itan skin hand creams are always 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.100
 a little bit a bit thicker though 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.470
 it also much richer 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.510
 So at the time I only had one 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.060
 used hand cream story and since then I 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.680
 those of laxey days know yes I would 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.120
 do not use any other and therefore 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.490
 an absolute favorite 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.410
 next i have two brushes for 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:46.710
 you and they are both funds uefa 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:48.840
 the one is the 10 1 lux face the fine 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.730
 I always use it to control 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.380
 And I'm not another for that 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.970
 More so I love that's awesome 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.280
 I've bound him so often 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.020
 washed and still loses none 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.630
 hair and is still super nice 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:03.750
 soft and her absolute favorite as well 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.370
 as well as von schÃ¤fer the brush 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.710
 it's so slightly beveled 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.720
 I always use for sheet now and then 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:12.060
 I also use others, but I love them 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.110
 most not so big and therefore 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.640
 You can also if you go now 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.800
 example only the apple cheeks in the 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.400
 middle already wants to shower too 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.230
 good word 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.550
 So if you just for example the 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.780
 defensive basin would adorn so 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.040
 It feels good , but you can do it too 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.900
 pull it back 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.240
 So I already love this brush 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.080
 very often washed and still no 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.210
 hair lost 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.100
 Great product next a mascara 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:34.980
 I may have only been two years old 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:37.680
 months possess but since almost every 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.170
 Tag is used and that is the dilemma 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.450
 scale of essence which is super great 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.500
 cheap but still makes so beautiful 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.420
 eyelashes 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.310
 so i know i know it is not for 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.970
 everyone what many find that too 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:53.670
 not so good because they are so weird 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.200
 curved brush has but I love 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.250
 this product and i can not do it myself 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.200
 think away more 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.790
 I love that sometimes simply because 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.090
 she does exactly what i do 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:05.460
 she wants more power and longer and yes 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.840
 I just love her next 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.960
 I do something for the lips and that one 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:12.360
 Care product I had since the end of 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.920
 very dry with dry lips too 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.049
 really fight really very dry 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.940
 and brittle and I have a lot of many things 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.739
 I tried it until I became known 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.840
 grab those lips cream here 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.430
 that is almost more than me 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.050
 love you she really helps 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.370
 so 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.470
 usually have so three times a day 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:28.789
 In addition, my lips are used 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.759
 clearly not as dry as 

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:33.199
 then and that's why this product 

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:34.759
 really help me look at it 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:36.949
 if you also dry and spray 

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:38.780
 has to fight lips next 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:40.250
 I know the hula bronze for you 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.569
 probably anyway 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.949
 I already have the flag 

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:44.750
 So I really have it 

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:46.940

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:49.099
 i love him because he is supermarket and 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.889
 very very long also on the catch 

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:53.240
 holds so does not settle or 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:55.220
 slipped or smeared or it 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.780
 Just go away as at cheaper 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.490
 Products from the drugstore I have 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.259
 that often experienced but with the cool 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.789
 Water is not the case 

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:03.830
