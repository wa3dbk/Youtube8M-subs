Chi you want to develop what is referred
to<00:00:05.130> as<00:00:05.310> kind<00:00:06.000> of<00:00:06.060> whole<00:00:06.270> body<00:00:06.509> power<00:00:06.810> and<00:00:08.750> on<00:00:09.750> a

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
to as kind of whole body power and on a

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.070 
to as kind of whole body power and on a
simple<00:00:10.469> level<00:00:10.500> and<00:00:11.130> I'm<00:00:12.059> kind<00:00:12.990> of

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
simple level and I'm kind of

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.200 
simple level and I'm kind of
unfortunately<00:00:13.710> this<00:00:13.920> it's<00:00:14.130> often<00:00:14.370> done<00:00:15.150> on

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
unfortunately this it's often done on

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.450 
unfortunately this it's often done on
this<00:00:15.509> level<00:00:15.750> kind<00:00:16.379> of<00:00:16.529> whole<00:00:16.680> body<00:00:16.949> power<00:00:17.250> is

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
this level kind of whole body power is

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.189 
this level kind of whole body power is
really<00:00:17.730> where<00:00:17.880> you<00:00:17.940> just<00:00:18.119> kind<00:00:18.359> of<00:00:18.420> you<00:00:18.930> get

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
really where you just kind of you get

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.019 
really where you just kind of you get
your<00:00:19.320> whole<00:00:19.560> body<00:00:19.590> really<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.340> move<00:00:20.520> as<00:00:20.820> one

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
your whole body really to move as one

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.820 
your whole body really to move as one
unit<00:00:21.510> and<00:00:22.550> through<00:00:23.550> that<00:00:23.820> you<00:00:24.150> convey<00:00:25.109> as<00:00:25.619> much

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
unit and through that you convey as much

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.710 
unit and through that you convey as much
power<00:00:26.070> as<00:00:26.189> you<00:00:26.310> have<00:00:26.580> through<00:00:26.849> your<00:00:27.240> basically

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
power as you have through your basically

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.420 
power as you have through your basically
your<00:00:27.869> legs<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:28.560> your<00:00:28.740> waist<00:00:30.590> on<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:32.160> more

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
your legs and your waist on a more

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.780 
your legs and your waist on a more
sophisticated<00:00:32.790> level<00:00:34.190> having<00:00:35.190> whole<00:00:35.460> body

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
sophisticated level having whole body

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.110 
sophisticated level having whole body
power<00:00:36.210> really<00:00:36.780> involves<00:00:37.739> developing<00:00:38.460> a

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
power really involves developing a

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.139 
power really involves developing a
really<00:00:39.780> good<00:00:40.020> connection<00:00:40.969> through<00:00:41.969> your

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
really good connection through your

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.680 
really good connection through your
spine<00:00:42.649> into<00:00:43.649> your<00:00:43.890> legs<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.340> into<00:00:45.210> your<00:00:45.329> arms

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
spine into your legs and into your arms

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.840 
spine into your legs and into your arms
and<00:00:45.809> so<00:00:46.800> when<00:00:47.430> you<00:00:47.670> do<00:00:48.000> one<00:00:48.390> thing<00:00:48.770> through<00:00:49.850> the

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
and so when you do one thing through the

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.180 
and so when you do one thing through the
core<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.149> your<00:00:51.449> body<00:00:51.660> it's<00:00:52.289> reflected<00:00:52.949> into

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
core of your body it's reflected into

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.500 
core of your body it's reflected into
you<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.579> what<00:00:53.730> you're<00:00:53.879> doing<00:00:54.059> in<00:00:54.180> your<00:00:54.210> legs

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
you of what you're doing in your legs

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.360 
you of what you're doing in your legs
and<00:00:54.840> in<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.920> arms<00:00:56.570> and<00:00:57.710> it's<00:00:58.710> getting<00:00:59.129> those

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
and in and arms and it's getting those

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.900 
and in and arms and it's getting those
things<00:00:59.609> all<00:00:59.940> really<00:01:00.420> unified<00:01:01.020> is<00:01:01.699> what<00:01:02.699> is

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
things all really unified is what is

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.420 
things all really unified is what is
really<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.539> challenge<00:01:03.960> I<00:01:04.170> mean<00:01:05.040> it's<00:01:05.220> one

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
really the challenge I mean it's one

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.090 
really the challenge I mean it's one
thing<00:01:06.140> like<00:01:07.140> if<00:01:07.320> someone<00:01:07.590> comes<00:01:07.740> over<00:01:07.860> here

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
thing like if someone comes over here

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.289 
thing like if someone comes over here
for<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.280> second<00:01:08.610> I<00:01:08.640> can<00:01:08.790> you<00:01:08.970> come<00:01:09.090> here<00:01:09.150> a

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
for a second I can you come here a

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.660 
for a second I can you come here a
second<00:01:09.570> okay<00:01:10.229> it's<00:01:10.740> one<00:01:10.890> thing<00:01:11.040> if<00:01:11.340> I'm<00:01:11.460> going

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
second okay it's one thing if I'm going

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.340 
second okay it's one thing if I'm going
to<00:01:11.760> push<00:01:11.970> gym<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.510> I<00:01:12.570> just<00:01:12.780> kind<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:13.020> really

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
to push gym and I just kind of really

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.149 
to push gym and I just kind of really
just<00:01:14.010> become<00:01:14.340> really<00:01:15.500> stable<00:01:16.500> with<00:01:16.619> my<00:01:16.740> body<00:01:16.950> I

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
just become really stable with my body I

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.260 
just become really stable with my body I
can<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.640> can<00:01:17.790> move<00:01:17.909> him<00:01:18.060> around<00:01:20.000> but<00:01:21.000> I'm<00:01:21.119> not

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
can I can move him around but I'm not

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.060 
can I can move him around but I'm not
especially<00:01:24.110> utilizing<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.530> strength<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.950> my

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
especially utilizing the strength of my

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.030 
especially utilizing the strength of my
whole<00:01:26.220> body<00:01:26.460> I'm<00:01:27.439> pushing<00:01:28.439> them<00:01:28.530> with<00:01:28.680> my<00:01:28.799> legs

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
whole body I'm pushing them with my legs

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.490 
whole body I'm pushing them with my legs
I'm<00:01:29.250> moving<00:01:29.759> them<00:01:29.880> around<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.210> room<00:01:30.409> but<00:01:31.409> I'm

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
I'm moving them around the room but I'm

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.069 
I'm moving them around the room but I'm
not<00:01:31.729> utilizing<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:32.909> lot<00:01:33.180> of<00:01:33.390> other<00:01:33.630> pieces<00:01:33.869> of

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
not utilizing a lot of other pieces of

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.359 
not utilizing a lot of other pieces of
my<00:01:34.229> body<00:01:34.380> that<00:01:34.619> have<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:34.890> do<00:01:35.009> with<00:01:35.040> getting

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
my body that have to do with getting

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.539 
my body that have to do with getting
strength<00:01:35.670> up<00:01:36.420> there<00:01:36.799> and<00:01:37.799> what<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.220> looks<00:01:38.369> so

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
strength up there and what it looks so

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.130 
strength up there and what it looks so
what<00:01:38.670> we're<00:01:38.820> going<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:38.970> be<00:01:39.090> working<00:01:39.270> on<00:01:39.540> is<00:01:39.960> how

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
what we're going to be working on is how

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.350 
what we're going to be working on is how
do<00:01:40.560> we<00:01:40.650> get<00:01:40.890> those<00:01:41.159> other<00:01:41.430> components<00:01:42.180> really

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
do we get those other components really

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.300 
do we get those other components really
to<00:01:42.570> start<00:01:42.810> working<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.530> getting<00:01:44.100> them<00:01:44.280> to

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
to start working and getting them to

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.670 
to start working and getting them to
work<00:01:44.549> together<00:01:44.790> cuz<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.360> key<00:01:45.689> is<00:01:46.110> getting

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
work together cuz the key is getting

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.090 
work together cuz the key is getting
them<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:47.040> all<00:01:47.189> work<00:01:47.220> at<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.509> same<00:01:48.720> time<00:01:49.100> you

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
them to all work at the same time you

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.109 
them to all work at the same time you
you<00:01:50.490> it's<00:01:50.759> too<00:01:51.149> slow<00:01:51.890> to<00:01:52.890> kind<00:01:53.130> of<00:01:53.250> do<00:01:53.759> a

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
you it's too slow to kind of do a

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.630 
you it's too slow to kind of do a
sequential<00:01:54.630> kind<00:01:55.560> of<00:01:55.680> opening<00:01:56.280> of<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.430> body

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
sequential kind of opening of the body

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.609 
sequential kind of opening of the body
and<00:01:56.880> stuff<00:01:57.060> it<00:01:57.659> really<00:01:58.110> has<00:01:58.439> to<00:01:58.590> be

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
and stuff it really has to be

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.260 
and stuff it really has to be
simultaneous<00:01:59.369> in<00:01:59.520> order<00:01:59.700> to<00:01:59.820> really<00:02:00.030> maximize

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
simultaneous in order to really maximize

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.310 
simultaneous in order to really maximize
the<00:02:00.540> power

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
the power

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.450 
the power
and<00:02:03.120> again<00:02:04.120> it's<00:02:04.330> like<00:02:04.479> this<00:02:05.140> is<00:02:05.290> where<00:02:05.460> you're

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
and again it's like this is where you're

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.779 
and again it's like this is where you're
kind<00:02:06.580> of<00:02:06.670> it's<00:02:07.030> easy<00:02:07.240> to<00:02:07.479> kind<00:02:07.690> of<00:02:07.720> run<00:02:07.960> into

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
kind of it's easy to kind of run into

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.810 
kind of it's easy to kind of run into
some<00:02:09.789> things<00:02:10.090> that<00:02:10.210> are<00:02:10.680> a<00:02:11.680> little<00:02:12.580> bit

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820 
some things that are a little bit

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.730 
some things that are a little bit
confusing<00:02:13.300> because<00:02:13.600> a<00:02:13.720> lot<00:02:13.840> in<00:02:14.080> like<00:02:14.530> in<00:02:14.650> the

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
confusing because a lot in like in the

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.410 
confusing because a lot in like in the
Taiji<00:02:14.920> classics<00:02:15.490> they<00:02:15.580> talk<00:02:15.790> about<00:02:15.940> the<00:02:16.180> Jing

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
Taiji classics they talk about the Jing

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.199 
Taiji classics they talk about the Jing
starting<00:02:17.380> in<00:02:17.470> the<00:02:17.560> feet<00:02:17.740> and<00:02:18.209> being

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
starting in the feet and being

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.180 
starting in the feet and being
controlled<00:02:20.110> by<00:02:20.230> the<00:02:20.290> waist<00:02:20.530> and<00:02:20.890> being

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
controlled by the waist and being

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.030 
controlled by the waist and being
manifest<00:02:21.670> in<00:02:21.820> the<00:02:21.880> hands<00:02:22.120> and<00:02:23.080> in<00:02:23.620> a<00:02:23.770> sense

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
manifest in the hands and in a sense

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.230 
manifest in the hands and in a sense
that<00:02:24.160> is<00:02:24.459> correct

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
that is correct

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.750 
that is correct
but<00:02:25.750> it<00:02:25.959> doesn't<00:02:26.350> tell<00:02:26.560> you<00:02:26.770> a<00:02:27.040> much<00:02:27.370> about

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
but it doesn't tell you a much about

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.910 
but it doesn't tell you a much about
what's<00:02:28.030> underlying<00:02:28.600> it<00:02:28.900> which<00:02:29.050> is<00:02:29.260> the<00:02:29.680> fact

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
what's underlying it which is the fact

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.400 
what's underlying it which is the fact
that<00:02:30.040> yes<00:02:30.610> it<00:02:30.880> does<00:02:31.090> start<00:02:31.750> in<00:02:31.900> the<00:02:32.050> feet<00:02:32.230> but

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
that yes it does start in the feet but

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.900 
that yes it does start in the feet but
it<00:02:32.500> doesn't<00:02:32.830> go<00:02:33.070> feet<00:02:33.630> waist<00:02:34.630> hands<00:02:35.590> it<00:02:36.580> really

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
it doesn't go feet waist hands it really

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.720 
it doesn't go feet waist hands it really
everything<00:02:37.570> is<00:02:37.690> doing<00:02:38.020> it<00:02:38.110> all<00:02:38.260> at<00:02:38.440> once<00:02:38.730> but

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
everything is doing it all at once but

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.080 
everything is doing it all at once but
the<00:02:39.940> the<00:02:40.420> actual<00:02:40.840> sense<00:02:41.739> of<00:02:42.010> the<00:02:42.160> energy<00:02:42.310> does

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
the the actual sense of the energy does

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.199 
the the actual sense of the energy does
follow<00:02:43.600> that<00:02:43.840> progression<00:02:44.489> but<00:02:45.489> the<00:02:45.820> actual

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
follow that progression but the actual

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:47.699 
follow that progression but the actual
movement<00:02:46.959> in<00:02:47.050> your<00:02:47.140> body<00:02:47.410> and<00:02:47.650> the

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
movement in your body and the

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.170 
movement in your body and the
integration<00:02:48.190> of<00:02:48.430> the<00:02:48.489> movement<00:02:48.850> of<00:02:48.910> your<00:02:49.000> body

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
integration of the movement of your body

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.630 
integration of the movement of your body
is<00:02:49.510> done<00:02:50.230> simultaneously<00:02:53.280> so<00:02:54.280> I<00:02:54.310> want<00:02:54.489> to<00:02:54.550> go

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
is done simultaneously so I want to go

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.600 
is done simultaneously so I want to go
back<00:02:54.820> and<00:02:55.180> look<00:02:55.510> at<00:02:56.130> you<00:02:57.130> know<00:02:57.220> some<00:02:57.459> of<00:02:57.489> what

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
back and look at you know some of what

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:58.830 
back and look at you know some of what
we've<00:02:57.790> done<00:02:57.910> before<00:02:58.300> and<00:02:58.420> some<00:02:58.570> of<00:02:58.660> the<00:02:58.720> other

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
we've done before and some of the other

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.580 
we've done before and some of the other
seminars<00:02:59.260> don't<00:02:59.440> bend<00:02:59.620> the<00:02:59.709> bow<00:02:59.890> and<00:03:01.530> kind<00:03:02.530> of

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
seminars don't bend the bow and kind of

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.080 
seminars don't bend the bow and kind of
you<00:03:02.680> think<00:03:02.920> of<00:03:03.010> this<00:03:03.100> from<00:03:03.400> a<00:03:03.459> standpoint<00:03:03.820> of

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
you think of this from a standpoint of

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.870 
you think of this from a standpoint of
being<00:03:04.660> a<00:03:05.050> structural<00:03:05.769> thing<00:03:05.800> it's<00:03:06.250> the<00:03:06.580> idea

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
being a structural thing it's the idea

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:07.860 
being a structural thing it's the idea
is<00:03:06.970> what<00:03:07.120> we're<00:03:07.269> trying<00:03:07.450> to<00:03:07.540> do<00:03:07.660> is<00:03:07.750> we're

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
is what we're trying to do is we're

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
is what we're trying to do is we're
trying<00:03:08.049> to<00:03:08.230> tie<00:03:08.500> through<00:03:09.459> our<00:03:09.610> backs<00:03:10.890> our

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
trying to tie through our backs our

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.740 
trying to tie through our backs our
upper<00:03:12.280> and<00:03:12.430> lower<00:03:12.580> body<00:03:12.820> together<00:03:13.120> and<00:03:13.600> so

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
upper and lower body together and so

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.840 
upper and lower body together and so
they<00:03:13.870> work<00:03:14.049> they<00:03:14.860> really<00:03:15.220> work<00:03:15.400> in<00:03:15.610> harmony

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
they work they really work in harmony

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:16.710 
they work they really work in harmony
with<00:03:16.120> one<00:03:16.269> another

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
with one another

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.850 
with one another
and<00:03:16.810> the<00:03:17.500> key<00:03:17.829> is<00:03:18.160> at<00:03:19.000> least<00:03:19.180> on<00:03:19.390> a<00:03:19.420> a<00:03:19.860> certain

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
and the key is at least on a a certain

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.910 
and the key is at least on a a certain
level<00:03:21.160> is<00:03:21.760> getting<00:03:22.380> the<00:03:23.380> kind<00:03:23.620> of<00:03:23.650> center

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
level is getting the kind of center

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.949 
level is getting the kind of center
point<00:03:24.250> which<00:03:24.549> is<00:03:24.700> where<00:03:24.880> your<00:03:25.570> soul<00:03:25.810> has

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
point which is where your soul has

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.250 
point which is where your soul has
muscles<00:03:26.440> and<00:03:26.760> your<00:03:27.760> Leatherman<00:03:28.750> store<00:03:29.049> size

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
muscles and your Leatherman store size

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.400 
muscles and your Leatherman store size
and<00:03:29.470> trapezius<00:03:30.010> overlap<00:03:30.900> because<00:03:31.900> that<00:03:32.260> and

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
and trapezius overlap because that and

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:33.960 
and trapezius overlap because that and
that's<00:03:32.590> that's<00:03:32.890> like<00:03:33.100> the<00:03:33.220> point<00:03:33.489> which<00:03:33.820> is

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
that's that's like the point which is

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.670 
that's that's like the point which is
actually<00:03:34.239> where<00:03:34.360> the<00:03:34.390> main<00:03:34.570> man<00:03:34.750> is<00:03:34.900> in<00:03:35.500> terms

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
actually where the main man is in terms

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.400 
actually where the main man is in terms
of<00:03:35.890> the<00:03:35.980> Chinese<00:03:36.480> description<00:03:37.480> of<00:03:37.570> it<00:03:38.070> is

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
of the Chinese description of it is

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.350 
of the Chinese description of it is
that's<00:03:41.410> a<00:03:41.530> big<00:03:41.799> transfer<00:03:42.579> point<00:03:42.910> where<00:03:43.209> you

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
that's a big transfer point where you

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.780 
that's a big transfer point where you
have<00:03:43.600> very<00:03:44.110> strong<00:03:44.799> muscles<00:03:45.310> in<00:03:45.549> your<00:03:45.579> body

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
have very strong muscles in your body

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.860 
have very strong muscles in your body
basically<00:03:48.790> joining<00:03:49.450> they<00:03:49.540> don't<00:03:49.720> actually

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
basically joining they don't actually

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.930 
basically joining they don't actually
join<00:03:50.769> but<00:03:51.070> they<00:03:51.190> connect<00:03:51.519> to<00:03:51.640> the<00:03:51.760> same

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
join but they connect to the same

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.110 
join but they connect to the same
vertebrae<00:03:52.360> and<00:03:53.070> so<00:03:54.070> you<00:03:54.130> end<00:03:54.370> up<00:03:54.519> with<00:03:54.730> this

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
vertebrae and so you end up with this

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:57.810 
vertebrae and so you end up with this
very<00:03:56.019> efficient<00:03:56.650> transfer<00:03:57.070> of<00:03:57.250> strength

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
very efficient transfer of strength

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.520 
very efficient transfer of strength
through<00:03:58.180> that<00:03:58.540> point<00:03:58.750> and<00:03:59.110> that's<00:03:59.230> where<00:03:59.320> you

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
through that point and that's where you

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.110 
through that point and that's where you
really<00:03:59.920> you<00:04:00.070> really<00:04:00.100> learn<00:04:00.549> to<00:04:00.760> start

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
really you really learn to start

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.520 
really you really learn to start
integrating<00:04:01.620> this<00:04:02.620> strength

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.040 

so<00:04:06.530> what<00:04:06.650> I<00:04:06.710> want<00:04:06.830> to<00:04:06.860> have<00:04:06.980> you<00:04:07.070> do<00:04:07.810> is<00:04:08.810> someone

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.050 
so what I want to have you do is someone

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.340 
so what I want to have you do is someone
comes<00:04:09.260> up<00:04:09.350> here<00:04:09.560> Jim<00:04:10.220> let's<00:04:10.400> go<00:04:11.170> come<00:04:12.170> on<00:04:12.260> why

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:12.350 
comes up here Jim let's go come on why

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:13.870
