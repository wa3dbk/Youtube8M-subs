00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.110
 the fire-fighting system is the present and two steel in possession of these 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.830
 two options the first is a specific project for protected devices 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.360
 where the nozzles are directed to specific areas of equipment risk 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.890
 this is the most economical alternative since the agent directed only to where 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.369
 you need the other option is the overlay protection 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:34.790
 in this scheme the nozzles are arranged is a straight line forming patterns of 

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:38.020
 overflow 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:44.150
 using this arrangement the equipment can be moved replaced 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:49.270
 and as long as they remain within the zone of fire voters they will be protected 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.610
 in the case of a real fire the fuse link detection system responds 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.720
 quickly to the heat 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:02.060
 when the temperature gradient was yielded, the link would shoot to cause 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.060
 release of compressed gas seat inside the Russian control panel 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.220
 simultaneously the compressed gas pressurizes the agent tank I think 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.390
 on them and the cylinder that triggers volume and mug the weekly show 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.450
 cutting costs 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.220
 the selection agent released throughout the system and quickly stinging the flames and 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.100
 like and has a neutral pick up factor it preserves kitchen equipment 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.260
 also 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:35.640
 to help prevent the re-release of the fire agent and create a blanket of 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.260
 foam which inhibits the release of a wave, for example, is modest and 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.440
 risk area 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.520
 the fire fighting system and the recent March 2 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.840
 is a flexible fire protection designed for the south itself 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.160
 constant change 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.080
 this way into Brazil 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.480
 direction jeremias timÃ³teo as long as the same sock in relation to the project is 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.860
