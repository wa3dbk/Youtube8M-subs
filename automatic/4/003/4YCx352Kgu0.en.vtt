on reading all Jane Austen's novels this
year<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.160> persuasion<00:01:02.820> was<00:01:02.940> first<00:01:03.210> on<00:01:03.449> my<00:01:03.600> list

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
year and persuasion was first on my list

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.840 
year and persuasion was first on my list
mainly<00:01:04.320> because<00:01:04.500> it's<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.010> shortest<00:01:05.430> and

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
mainly because it's the shortest and

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.330 
mainly because it's the shortest and
though<00:01:06.330> I<00:01:06.360> did<00:01:06.810> really<00:01:07.080> enjoy<00:01:07.619> this<00:01:07.830> book<00:01:07.890> I

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
though I did really enjoy this book I

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.340 
though I did really enjoy this book I
didn't<00:01:08.760> necessarily<00:01:08.880> think<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.630> lived<00:01:10.049> up<00:01:10.290> to

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
didn't necessarily think it lived up to

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.800 
didn't necessarily think it lived up to
how<00:01:10.710> amazing<00:01:11.369> her<00:01:11.610> other<00:01:11.790> books<00:01:12.090> were<00:01:12.479> first

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
how amazing her other books were first

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.030 
how amazing her other books were first
I'm<00:01:13.049> gonna<00:01:13.140> talk<00:01:13.290> about<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.619> things<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:14.010> I

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
I'm gonna talk about the things that I

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.039 
I'm gonna talk about the things that I
really<00:01:14.369> enjoyed<00:01:14.700> about<00:01:14.729> persuasion<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:15.900> I

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
really enjoyed about persuasion and I

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.050 
really enjoyed about persuasion and I
will<00:01:16.229> say<00:01:16.380> that<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.619> story<00:01:16.920> is<00:01:17.130> quite<00:01:17.340> simple

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
will say that the story is quite simple

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.700 
will say that the story is quite simple
I<00:01:18.240> think<00:01:18.270> when<00:01:18.840> you<00:01:18.930> read<00:01:19.080> a<00:01:19.110> synopsis<00:01:19.290> you

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
I think when you read a synopsis you

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.830 
I think when you read a synopsis you
know<00:01:20.040> what<00:01:20.250> you're<00:01:20.369> going<00:01:20.580> into<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.360> really

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
know what you're going into and really

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.109 
know what you're going into and really
that's<00:01:22.470> what<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.920> story<00:01:23.189> is<00:01:23.490> it's<00:01:23.759> nothing

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
that's what the story is it's nothing

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.880 
that's what the story is it's nothing
quite<00:01:24.390> unexpected<00:01:25.140> I<00:01:25.259> think<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.530> plot<00:01:25.710> is

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
quite unexpected I think the plot is

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.190 
quite unexpected I think the plot is
very<00:01:25.950> linear<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.909> because<00:01:27.540> of<00:01:27.659> such<00:01:27.840> I<00:01:27.960> think

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
very linear and because of such I think

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.319 
very linear and because of such I think
some<00:01:28.380> people<00:01:28.590> might<00:01:28.770> find<00:01:29.040> it<00:01:29.189> easier<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.759> get

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
some people might find it easier to get

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.300 
some people might find it easier to get
into<00:01:30.689> as<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:30.930> love<00:01:31.259> story<00:01:31.530> another<00:01:31.950> thing<00:01:32.220> I

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
into as a love story another thing I

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.399 
into as a love story another thing I
really<00:01:32.549> liked<00:01:32.850> is<00:01:33.119> just<00:01:33.390> how<00:01:33.540> good<00:01:33.869> character

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
really liked is just how good character

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.530 
really liked is just how good character
was<00:01:34.680> she's<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:34.979> really<00:01:35.250> noble<00:01:35.549> kind<00:01:36.060> of<00:01:36.119> humble

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
was she's a really noble kind of humble

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.539 
was she's a really noble kind of humble
person<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.290> I<00:01:37.470> really<00:01:37.890> appreciated<00:01:38.400> that

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
person and I really appreciated that

when it comes to the first half of the

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.440 
when it comes to the first half of the
book<00:02:46.830> which<00:02:47.280> I<00:02:47.430> found<00:02:47.670> to<00:02:47.760> be<00:02:47.790> in<00:02:47.970> general<00:02:48.330> a

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
book which I found to be in general a

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.120 
book which I found to be in general a
little<00:02:48.630> boring<00:02:49.110> another<00:02:49.650> thing<00:02:49.830> I<00:02:49.920> want<00:02:50.070> to

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
little boring another thing I want to

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.470 
little boring another thing I want to
say<00:02:50.280> is<00:02:50.370> that<00:02:50.519> I<00:02:50.550> found<00:02:50.820> these<00:02:50.940> characters<00:02:51.330> to

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
say is that I found these characters to

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.420 
say is that I found these characters to
be<00:02:51.510> a<00:02:51.630> little<00:02:51.930> flat<00:02:52.380> in<00:02:52.709> general<00:02:53.280> I<00:02:53.400> don't

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
be a little flat in general I don't

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.610 
be a little flat in general I don't
think<00:02:53.760> they're<00:02:53.880> quite<00:02:54.030> as<00:02:54.209> nuanced<00:02:54.959> or<00:02:55.110> as

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
think they're quite as nuanced or as

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.130 
think they're quite as nuanced or as
exciting<00:02:56.430> as<00:02:56.910> some<00:02:57.209> of<00:02:57.330> her<00:02:57.420> other<00:02:57.450> characters

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
exciting as some of her other characters

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.259 
exciting as some of her other characters
and<00:02:58.290> her<00:02:58.350> other<00:02:58.530> novels<00:02:58.739> and<00:02:59.280> I<00:02:59.550> think<00:02:59.820> that

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
and her other novels and I think that

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.180 
and her other novels and I think that
really<00:03:00.660> again<00:03:01.019> it<00:03:01.260> made<00:03:01.380> this<00:03:01.530> story<00:03:01.800> a<00:03:01.860> little

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
really again it made this story a little

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.460 
really again it made this story a little
bit<00:03:02.340> slow<00:03:02.640> for<00:03:02.970> me<00:03:03.090> and<00:03:03.330> a<00:03:03.660> little<00:03:03.959> bit<00:03:04.140> boring

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
bit slow for me and a little bit boring

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.680 
bit slow for me and a little bit boring
stuff<00:03:05.070> about<00:03:05.310> the<00:03:05.459> plot<00:03:05.820> now<00:03:06.239> I<00:03:06.269> know<00:03:06.450> I<00:03:06.570> said

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
stuff about the plot now I know I said

stuff about the plot now I know I said
this<00:03:07.080> is<00:03:07.200> quite<00:03:07.380> a<00:03:07.410> simple<00:03:07.709> plot<00:03:08.010> that's<00:03:08.190> one

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
that but I've come to realize that when

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.000 
that but I've come to realize that when
it<00:03:12.390> comes<00:03:12.540> to<00:03:12.600> Jane<00:03:12.780> Austen<00:03:13.110> novels<00:03:13.560> I<00:03:13.620> prefer

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
plots that are a little bit more nuanced

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.660 
plots that are a little bit more nuanced
a<00:03:15.870> little<00:03:16.079> bit<00:03:16.170> more<00:03:16.350> exciting<00:03:16.980> if<00:03:17.459> you've

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
a little bit more exciting if you've

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.310 
a little bit more exciting if you've
read<00:03:17.880> Emma<00:03:18.120> then<00:03:18.360> you<00:03:18.450> know<00:03:18.630> all<00:03:18.900> kinds<00:03:19.110> of

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
missing that in persuasion it felt very

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.880 
missing that in persuasion it felt very
linear<00:03:23.970> which<00:03:24.269> i<00:03:24.450> think<00:03:24.540> is<00:03:24.930> good<00:03:25.410> in<00:03:25.560> its<00:03:25.709> own

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
linear which i think is good in its own

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.130 
linear which i think is good in its own
way<00:03:26.190> but<00:03:26.570> personally<00:03:27.570> you<00:03:27.720> know<00:03:27.840> for<00:03:28.019> my<00:03:28.110> own

preferences<00:03:28.829> I<00:03:29.010> prefer<00:03:29.280> things<00:03:29.430> a<00:03:29.730> little<00:03:30.000> bit

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
preferences I prefer things a little bit

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:31.910 
preferences I prefer things a little bit
more<00:03:30.420> nuanced<00:03:30.810> a<00:03:30.930> little<00:03:31.110> bit<00:03:31.200> more<00:03:31.380> exciting

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
more nuanced a little bit more exciting

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.830

a<00:03:32.130> little<00:03:32.340> bit<00:03:32.430> more<00:03:32.610> unpredictable<00:03:33.060> overall

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
a little bit more unpredictable overall

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.870 
a little bit more unpredictable overall
I<00:03:33.870> found<00:03:34.140> this<00:03:34.350> to<00:03:34.530> be<00:03:34.560> quite<00:03:35.220> predictable

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
I found this to be quite predictable

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:36.830 
I found this to be quite predictable
last<00:03:36.150> thing<00:03:36.269> I<00:03:36.329> want<00:03:36.450> to<00:03:36.480> say<00:03:36.600> about<00:03:36.690> the

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
last thing I want to say about the

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.150 
last thing I want to say about the
characters<00:03:37.200> is<00:03:37.380> that<00:03:37.410> though<00:03:37.709> Anna<00:03:37.980> is<00:03:38.130> a

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
characters is that though Anna is a

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.890 
characters is that though Anna is a
really<00:03:38.400> great<00:03:38.610> person<00:03:39.060> I<00:03:39.269> felt<00:03:39.510> everyone

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
really great person I felt everyone

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.039 
really great person I felt everyone
around<00:03:40.260> her<00:03:40.530> was<00:03:40.739> really<00:03:41.810> grating<00:03:42.810> they

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
around her was really grating they

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:45.470 
around her was really grating they
grated<00:03:43.470> on<00:03:43.620> my<00:03:43.799> nerves<00:03:44.100> and<00:03:44.579> I<00:03:44.790> really<00:03:45.209> just

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
grated on my nerves and I really just

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.680 
grated on my nerves and I really just
was<00:03:46.049> not<00:03:46.290> pleased<00:03:46.860> with<00:03:47.160> them<00:03:47.400> whatsoever<00:03:48.150> and

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
was not pleased with them whatsoever and

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.120 
was not pleased with them whatsoever and
it's<00:03:48.840> really<00:03:49.049> frustrating<00:03:49.260> reading<00:03:49.860> a<00:03:49.950> book

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
it's really frustrating reading a book

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.069 
it's really frustrating reading a book
where<00:03:50.400> you're<00:03:50.820> really<00:03:51.030> only<00:03:51.630> slightly

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
where you're really only slightly

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:53.660 
where you're really only slightly
attached<00:03:52.530> to<00:03:52.769> the<00:03:52.890> main<00:03:53.070> character<00:03:53.549> and

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
attached to the main character and

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.190 
attached to the main character and
perhaps<00:03:53.940> her<00:03:54.299> love<00:03:54.570> interest

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
perhaps her love interest

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.319 
perhaps her love interest
apart<00:03:55.799> from<00:03:55.890> that<00:03:55.980> other<00:03:56.459> characters<00:03:56.910> I<00:03:57.120> just

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
apart from that other characters I just

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:59.720 
apart from that other characters I just
did<00:03:57.660> not<00:03:58.079> care<00:03:58.500> for<00:03:58.799> and<00:03:59.010> because<00:03:59.280> of<00:03:59.310> such<00:03:59.579> I

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
did not care for and because of such I

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.460 
did not care for and because of such I
didn't<00:03:59.940> necessarily<00:04:00.060> care<00:04:00.480> what<00:04:00.720> happened<00:04:01.110> to

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
didn't necessarily care what happened to

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:03.830 
didn't necessarily care what happened to
them<00:04:01.709> all<00:04:01.950> that<00:04:02.190> being<00:04:02.400> said<00:04:02.489> I<00:04:02.790> think<00:04:03.030> that<00:04:03.390> I

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
them all that being said I think that I

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.270 
them all that being said I think that I
would<00:04:04.170> rate<00:04:04.380> the<00:04:04.530> first<00:04:04.799> half<00:04:05.010> of<00:04:05.040> the<00:04:05.190> book

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
would rate the first half of the book

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.460 
would rate the first half of the book
three<00:04:05.640> stars<00:04:06.000> I<00:04:06.329> thought<00:04:06.480> it<00:04:06.600> was<00:04:06.720> decent<00:04:06.959> but

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
three stars I thought it was decent but

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:08.810 
three stars I thought it was decent but
at<00:04:07.620> times<00:04:07.890> it<00:04:08.130> didn't<00:04:08.280> really<00:04:08.459> hold<00:04:08.609> my

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
at times it didn't really hold my

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.940 
at times it didn't really hold my
attention<00:04:08.940> and<00:04:09.600> the<00:04:10.380> second<00:04:10.709> half<00:04:10.829> of<00:04:10.890> the

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
attention and the second half of the

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.800 
attention and the second half of the
book<00:04:11.040> I<00:04:11.190> would<00:04:11.400> give<00:04:11.579> four<00:04:12.000> stars<00:04:12.329> because<00:04:12.570> I

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
book I would give four stars because I

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.840 
book I would give four stars because I
think<00:04:12.870> it<00:04:13.109> really<00:04:13.140> picked<00:04:13.739> up<00:04:13.950> and<00:04:14.190> I<00:04:14.340> loved

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
think it really picked up and I loved

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.849 
think it really picked up and I loved
seeing<00:04:15.120> ends<00:04:15.420> in<00:04:15.690> her<00:04:15.810> monologue<00:04:16.320> and<00:04:16.530> I<00:04:16.620> loved

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
seeing ends in her monologue and I loved

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:18.349 
seeing ends in her monologue and I loved
seeing<00:04:17.070> her<00:04:17.280> interact<00:04:17.760> with<00:04:17.970> Captain

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
seeing her interact with Captain

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:21.020 
seeing her interact with Captain
Wentworth<00:04:18.750> so<00:04:19.410> this<00:04:19.919> book<00:04:20.130> is<00:04:20.280> kind<00:04:20.459> of<00:04:20.549> tough

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
right because I had these varying

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.710 
right because I had these varying
opinions<00:04:22.830> but<00:04:23.550> overall<00:04:23.880> ended<00:04:24.240> up<00:04:24.330> giving<00:04:24.540> it

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720

times I thought it was a little bit

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.450 
times I thought it was a little bit
boring<00:04:33.840> and<00:04:34.050> a<00:04:34.080> little<00:04:34.260> bit<00:04:34.350> slow<00:04:34.710> and<00:04:35.100> and

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
boring and a little bit slow and and

boring and a little bit slow and and
just<00:04:35.669> wasn't<00:04:36.120> my<00:04:36.210> favorite<00:04:36.540> heroine<00:04:36.930> to<00:04:37.110> read

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
just wasn't my favorite heroine to read

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.140 
just wasn't my favorite heroine to read
about<00:04:37.500> in<00:04:37.800> terms<00:04:37.980> of<00:04:38.190> Jane<00:04:38.340> Austen<00:04:38.669> novels<00:04:39.000> out

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
about in terms of Jane Austen novels out

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:40.490 
about in terms of Jane Austen novels out
of<00:04:39.270> the<00:04:39.360> three<00:04:39.630> that<00:04:39.750> I<00:04:39.810> have<00:04:39.960> read<00:04:40.200> I<00:04:40.230> would

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
of the three that I have read I would

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.020 
of the three that I have read I would
not<00:04:40.650> necessarily<00:04:40.830> recommend<00:04:41.520> starting<00:04:41.910> off

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
not necessarily recommend starting off

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
with persuasion I definitely recommend

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.680 
with persuasion I definitely recommend
starting<00:04:44.580> off<00:04:44.700> with<00:04:44.820> Emma<00:04:45.090> because<00:04:45.419> I<00:04:45.630> think

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
starting off with Emma because I think

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.930 
starting off with Emma because I think
it's<00:04:45.930> the<00:04:45.990> most<00:04:46.230> action-packed<00:04:46.740> and<00:04:47.280> exciting

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
it's the most action-packed and exciting

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.060 
it's the most action-packed and exciting
and<00:04:48.120> drama<00:04:48.750> filled<00:04:49.139> out<00:04:49.410> of<00:04:49.650> all<00:04:49.800> of<00:04:49.919> Jane

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
and drama filled out of all of Jane

Austen's<00:04:50.460> novels<00:04:50.880> I<00:04:51.090> would<00:04:51.240> start<00:04:51.600> there<00:04:51.810> but

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
on listening to most of four other

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.640 
on listening to most of four other
novels<00:05:14.760> just<00:05:15.030> because<00:05:15.270> it's<00:05:15.479> easier<00:05:16.169> for<00:05:16.440> me

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650 
novels just because it's easier for me

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.440 
novels just because it's easier for me
and<00:05:16.860> for<00:05:17.250> some<00:05:17.400> reason<00:05:17.760> I<00:05:17.880> just<00:05:17.910> find<00:05:18.270> the

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:18.450 
and for some reason I just find the

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:19.760 
and for some reason I just find the
language<00:05:18.660> clicks<00:05:19.139> with<00:05:19.290> me<00:05:19.410> a<00:05:19.440> little<00:05:19.650> bit

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
language clicks with me a little bit

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.800 
language clicks with me a little bit
better<00:05:19.950> if<00:05:20.100> I<00:05:20.220> listen<00:05:20.610> to<00:05:20.639> it<00:05:20.910> and<00:05:21.150> it<00:05:21.570> kind<00:05:21.750> of

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
better if I listen to it and it kind of

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:23.840 
better if I listen to it and it kind of
feels<00:05:22.020> like<00:05:22.169> I'm<00:05:22.560> listening<00:05:22.919> to<00:05:23.280> a<00:05:23.550> Jane

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:23.850 
feels like I'm listening to a Jane

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:25.880 
feels like I'm listening to a Jane
Austen<00:05:24.080> adaptation<00:05:25.080> which<00:05:25.290> is<00:05:25.440> just<00:05:25.650> great

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
except it's not adaptation because it's

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.480 
except it's not adaptation because it's
the<00:05:28.229> real<00:05:28.410> deal<00:05:28.440> it's<00:05:28.950> pretty<00:05:29.130> much<00:05:29.250> all<00:05:29.460> I
