okay<00:00:01.469> so<00:00:01.530> I'm<00:00:01.740> here<00:00:01.770> at<00:00:02.010> techniques<00:00:02.399> building

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
okay so I'm here at techniques building

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.510 
okay so I'm here at techniques building

this dampening rod here that goes inside

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.860 
this dampening rod here that goes inside
the<00:00:39.480> fork<00:00:40.219> we've<00:00:41.219> filled<00:00:41.820> some<00:00:42.059> holes<00:00:42.360> yeah

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
the fork we've filled some holes yeah

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:50.150 
the fork we've filled some holes yeah
and<00:00:43.079> you've<00:00:43.230> enlarged<00:00:43.800> other<00:00:44.070> hot<00:00:44.309> yes<00:00:49.160> when

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
and you've enlarged other hot yes when

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.869 
and you've enlarged other hot yes when
the<00:00:50.280> fork<00:00:51.289> so<00:00:52.289> this<00:00:52.649> damper<00:00:53.100> rod<00:00:53.129> sits<00:00:53.640> like

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
the fork so this damper rod sits like

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.490 
the fork so this damper rod sits like
this<00:00:54.170> inside<00:00:55.170> this<00:00:55.440> foot<00:00:55.770> fork<00:00:56.370> tube<00:00:57.469> there<00:00:58.469> is

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
this inside this foot fork tube there is

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.180 
this inside this foot fork tube there is
a<00:00:58.620> seal<00:00:58.980> in<00:00:59.399> here<00:00:59.629> of<00:01:00.629> sorts<00:01:01.079> it's<00:01:01.949> not

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
a seal in here of sorts it's not

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.500 
a seal in here of sorts it's not
particularly<00:01:02.550> good<00:01:02.730> yep<00:01:03.329> but<00:01:03.600> it's<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:03.809> seal<00:01:05.510> as

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
particularly good yep but it's a seal as

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.899 
particularly good yep but it's a seal as
the<00:01:06.659> four<00:01:07.040> compresses<00:01:08.840> the<00:01:10.280> the<00:01:11.280> column<00:01:11.790> of

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
the four compresses the the column of

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.810 
the four compresses the the column of
oil<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:12.420> sits<00:01:12.990> below<00:01:13.229> here<00:01:13.619> is<00:01:14.220> forced

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
oil that sits below here is forced

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.789 
oil that sits below here is forced
through<00:01:14.909> these<00:01:15.509> these<00:01:16.080> holes<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.590> those

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
through these these holes and those

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.300 
through these these holes and those
holes<00:01:17.130> control<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.909> damping<00:01:18.299> those<00:01:18.780> holes

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
holes control the damping those holes

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
holes control the damping those holes
control<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.640> compression<00:01:21.090> compression

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
control the compression compression

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.929 
control the compression compression
depth<00:01:21.780> is<00:01:21.960> in<00:01:22.110> winner<00:01:22.320> Forks<00:01:22.770> being<00:01:23.100> compress

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
depth is in winner Forks being compress

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.490 
depth is in winner Forks being compress
the<00:01:24.330> amount<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:24.689> all<00:01:24.869> that<00:01:25.049> can<00:01:25.140> get<00:01:25.320> out<00:01:25.439> of

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
the amount of all that can get out of

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.380 
the amount of all that can get out of
those<00:01:25.590> holes<00:01:25.830> is<00:01:26.340> what<00:01:26.700> controls<00:01:27.180> the

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
those holes is what controls the

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.929 
those holes is what controls the
compression<00:01:27.900> damping<00:01:28.200> so<00:01:28.770> hence<00:01:29.100> my<00:01:29.369> surprise

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
compression damping so hence my surprise

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.149 
compression damping so hence my surprise
when<00:01:30.420> you<00:01:30.479> made<00:01:30.869> those<00:01:31.079> holes<00:01:31.140> bigger<00:01:31.770> so<00:01:31.979> I've

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
when you made those holes bigger so I've

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.700 
when you made those holes bigger so I've
drilled<00:01:32.700> those<00:01:33.060> holes<00:01:33.329> out<00:01:33.540> because<00:01:34.500> you<00:01:34.590> can

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
drilled those holes out because you can

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.710 
drilled those holes out because you can
have<00:01:34.860> Forks<00:01:35.250> with<00:01:35.400> two<00:01:35.759> holes<00:01:36.000> or<00:01:36.270> one<00:01:36.450> hole<00:01:36.689> or

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
have Forks with two holes or one hole or

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.690 
have Forks with two holes or one hole or
four<00:01:37.110> holes<00:01:37.350> or<00:01:37.590> six<00:01:37.770> months<00:01:38.040> well<00:01:38.310> I<00:01:38.400> have<00:01:38.579> you

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
four holes or six months well I have you

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.069 
four holes or six months well I have you
drilled<00:01:38.970> them<00:01:39.090> out<00:01:39.240> I've<00:01:39.509> killed<00:01:39.810> them<00:01:39.930> out

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
drilled them out I've killed them out

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.050 
drilled them out I've killed them out
because<00:01:40.200> I<00:01:40.320> don't<00:01:40.650> want<00:01:41.100> them<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:41.909> be

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
because I don't want them to be

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.389 
because I don't want them to be
effective<00:01:42.600> anymore<00:01:42.780> so<00:01:43.380> they<00:01:43.500> no<00:01:43.829> longer<00:01:43.860> have

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
effective anymore so they no longer have

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.370 
effective anymore so they no longer have
any<00:01:44.670> dampening<00:01:45.240> compression<00:01:45.780> dam<00:01:45.930> in<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.110> very

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
any dampening compression dam in a very

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.550 
any dampening compression dam in a very
minimal<00:01:46.829> amount<00:01:47.640> of<00:01:47.880> dampening<00:01:48.360> character<00:01:49.350> is

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
minimal amount of dampening character is

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.480 
minimal amount of dampening character is
is<00:01:50.810> created<00:01:51.810> so<00:01:52.799> what's<00:01:53.009> going<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.280> stop<00:01:53.460> a

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
is created so what's going to stop a

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.950 
is created so what's going to stop a
blind<00:01:53.820> straight<00:01:54.060> for<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.299> strike<00:01:54.509> now<00:01:54.659> well

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
blind straight for the strike now well

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.999 
blind straight for the strike now well
as<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:56.280> four<00:01:56.570> compresses<00:01:57.570> this<00:01:58.560> oil<00:01:58.829> is

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
as the four compresses this oil is

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.920 
as the four compresses this oil is
forced<00:01:59.490> through<00:01:59.579> this<00:01:59.850> holes<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.329> it<00:02:00.390> travels

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
forced through this holes and it travels

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.350 
forced through this holes and it travels
up<00:02:01.020> through<00:02:01.079> here<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:02.100> out<00:02:02.369> through<00:02:02.880> after

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
up through here and out through after

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.719 
up through here and out through after
that<00:02:03.509> hole<00:02:03.719> yeah<00:02:03.960> right<00:02:04.259> so<00:02:04.680> what<00:02:05.250> we<00:02:05.399> can<00:02:05.579> do

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
that hole yeah right so what we can do

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.850 
that hole yeah right so what we can do
is<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.060> trynna<00:02:06.390> can<00:02:06.659> control<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.710> oil

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
is to the trynna can control the oil

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.830 
is to the trynna can control the oil
flow<00:02:08.129> down<00:02:08.429> here<00:02:08.759> which<00:02:09.119> should<00:02:09.270> be<00:02:09.330> very<00:02:09.390> hard

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
flow down here which should be very hard

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.650 
flow down here which should be very hard
or<00:02:09.959> just<00:02:09.989> like<00:02:10.590> well<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:11.039> problem<00:02:11.370> it's<00:02:11.489> fixed

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
or just like well the problem it's fixed

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.950 
or just like well the problem it's fixed
you<00:02:13.230> end<00:02:13.560> up<00:02:13.770> with<00:02:14.040> with<00:02:14.760> low-speed<00:02:15.510> dampening

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
you end up with with low-speed dampening

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.840 
you end up with with low-speed dampening

dampening<00:02:44.160> than<00:02:44.340> you<00:02:44.400> actually<00:02:44.760> want<00:02:44.970> okay<00:02:45.360> so

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
dampening than you actually want okay so

how<00:02:45.720> you're<00:02:45.900> gonna<00:02:45.990> deal<00:02:46.200> with<00:02:46.230> this<00:02:46.410> down<00:02:46.620> so

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
how you're gonna deal with this down so

how you're gonna deal with this down so
what<00:02:47.490> we<00:02:47.610> do<00:02:47.760> is<00:02:47.970> we<00:02:48.120> just<00:02:48.150> we<00:02:48.690> just<00:02:48.720> drew<00:02:49.680> let

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
what we do is we just we just drew let

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.070 
what we do is we just we just drew let

has any effect and we put a damping a
dampening<00:02:58.070> valve<00:03:00.020> device<00:03:01.020> called<00:03:01.560> what<00:03:02.130> what
