are not because they are born that way

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:23.519 
are not because they are born that way
but<00:00:22.239> more<00:00:22.449> because<00:00:22.810> they<00:00:22.989> are<00:00:23.079> just<00:00:23.289> simply

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:25.689 
inactive and they're inactive because

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:28.349 
inactive and they're inactive because
they<00:00:25.989> have<00:00:26.109> no<00:00:26.289> positive<00:00:26.529> role<00:00:26.979> model<00:00:27.310> so<00:00:28.060> the

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:28.359 
they have no positive role model so the

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:29.969 
they have no positive role model so the
researcher<00:00:28.779> was<00:00:28.899> basically<00:00:29.289> telling<00:00:29.589> me<00:00:29.800> that

00:00:29.969 --> 00:00:29.979 
researcher was basically telling me that

00:00:29.979 --> 00:00:32.280 
researcher was basically telling me that
if<00:00:30.130> you<00:00:30.279> got<00:00:30.460> adults<00:00:31.029> to<00:00:31.630> become<00:00:31.899> more<00:00:32.050> active

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 
if you got adults to become more active

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.830 
if you got adults to become more active
that<00:00:33.070> would<00:00:33.310> you<00:00:33.760> know<00:00:33.850> translate<00:00:34.390> into<00:00:34.630> the

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:34.840 
that would you know translate into the

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.240 
that would you know translate into the
kids<00:00:35.050> being<00:00:35.260> more<00:00:35.440> active<00:00:35.590> and<00:00:35.950> then<00:00:36.130> you

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.250 
kids being more active and then you

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:38.340 
kids being more active and then you
would<00:00:36.400> reduce<00:00:36.670> the<00:00:36.880> obesity<00:00:37.150> rates<00:00:37.570> in<00:00:37.780> this
