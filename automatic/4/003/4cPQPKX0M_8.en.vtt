shoes i put on a pair of black boots the

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.450 
shoes i put on a pair of black boots the
reason<00:01:57.060> why<00:01:57.150> i<00:01:57.180> went<00:01:57.330> for<00:01:57.510> black<00:01:57.750> shoes<00:01:58.080> is

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
reason why i went for black shoes is

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.070 
reason why i went for black shoes is
because<00:01:59.460> of<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.790> leggings<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.540> would<00:02:00.900> have

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
because of the leggings it would have

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.500 
because of the leggings it would have
been<00:02:01.110> too<00:02:01.350> much<00:02:01.680> to<00:02:01.920> wear<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.310> white<00:02:02.820> shirt<00:02:02.850> a

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 
been too much to wear a white shirt a

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.620 
been too much to wear a white shirt a
floral<00:02:04.140> skirt<00:02:04.409> black<00:02:05.250> leggings<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.119> then

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
floral skirt black leggings and then

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.559 
floral skirt black leggings and then
maybe<00:02:06.960> brown<00:02:07.409> shoes<00:02:07.799> that's<00:02:08.700> just<00:02:09.060> too<00:02:09.360> many

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
maybe brown shoes that's just too many

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.720 
maybe brown shoes that's just too many
colors<00:02:10.019> so<00:02:10.530> if<00:02:10.679> you<00:02:10.799> skip<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.129> leggings<00:02:11.519> i

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
colors so if you skip the leggings i

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.640 
colors so if you skip the leggings i
think<00:02:12.060> it<00:02:12.269> would<00:02:12.480> be<00:02:12.540> gorgeous<00:02:12.930> to<00:02:13.260> wear<00:02:13.409> brown

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
think it would be gorgeous to wear brown

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.520
