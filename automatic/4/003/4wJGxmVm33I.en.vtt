00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
and stuff I I make a point of not

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.450 
and stuff I I make a point of not
reading<00:05:15.330> them<00:05:15.450> afterwards<00:05:15.930> because<00:05:16.290> I<00:05:16.560> don't

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
reading them afterwards because I don't

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:18.470 
reading them afterwards because I don't
think<00:05:17.580> that<00:05:17.760> well<00:05:17.940> they're<00:05:18.060> not<00:05:18.150> written<00:05:18.420> for

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:18.480 
think that well they're not written for

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.290 
think that well they're not written for
me<00:05:18.660> anyway<00:05:19.020> so<00:05:19.490> basically<00:05:20.490> for<00:05:20.700> me<00:05:20.850> you<00:05:21.180> know

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
me anyway so basically for me you know

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.680 
me anyway so basically for me you know
don't<00:05:21.480> read<00:05:21.720> it<00:05:21.840> measure<00:05:22.050> it<00:05:22.140> and<00:05:23.060> III<00:05:24.060> so

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
don't read it measure it and III so

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.240 
don't read it measure it and III so
therefore<00:05:25.320> I<00:05:25.380> don't<00:05:25.440> want<00:05:25.650> to<00:05:25.710> take<00:05:25.860> on<00:05:26.010> board

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
therefore I don't want to take on board

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.190 
therefore I don't want to take on board
all<00:05:26.430> that<00:05:26.610> stuff<00:05:26.880> that<00:05:26.910> other<00:05:27.690> people<00:05:28.080> might

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:28.200 
all that stuff that other people might

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:30.530 
all that stuff that other people might
be<00:05:28.260> saying<00:05:28.620> but<00:05:28.860> that's<00:05:29.100> that<00:05:29.970> I<00:05:30.000> would<00:05:30.330> take

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:30.540 
be saying but that's that I would take

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.270 
be saying but that's that I would take
it<00:05:30.720> as<00:05:30.810> a<00:05:30.840> positive<00:05:31.080> thing<00:05:31.650> and<00:05:31.680> that's<00:05:31.980> that's

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
it as a positive thing and that's that's

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.820 
it as a positive thing and that's that's
that's<00:05:32.490> helpful<00:05:33.120> however<00:05:34.080> I'm<00:05:34.260> married<00:05:34.650> and

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
that's helpful however I'm married and

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:36.590 
that's helpful however I'm married and
so<00:05:35.430> it's<00:05:36.180> pointless

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:36.600 
so it's pointless

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.930 
so it's pointless
yeah<00:05:36.870> pointless<00:05:37.350> and<00:05:38.310> being<00:05:38.520> back<00:05:38.670> on<00:05:38.850> the
