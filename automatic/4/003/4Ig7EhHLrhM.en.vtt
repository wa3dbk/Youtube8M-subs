kill<00:01:16.310> him<00:01:16.459> we<00:01:16.550> were<00:01:16.640> getting<00:01:16.729> hit<00:01:17.000> market<00:01:17.360> we

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
kill him we were getting hit market we

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:18.999 
kill him we were getting hit market we
weren't<00:01:17.810> even<00:01:17.990> hit<00:01:18.259> markers<00:01:18.649> we<00:01:18.800> were<00:01:18.890> just

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
weren't even hit markers we were just

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:21.880 
weren't even hit markers we were just
hitting<00:01:19.310> him<00:01:19.520> and<00:01:19.759> it<00:01:20.660> was<00:01:20.840> not<00:01:20.990> doing<00:01:21.259> a<00:01:21.319> thing

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
hitting him and it was not doing a thing

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.469 
hitting him and it was not doing a thing
it<00:01:22.310> could<00:01:22.429> even<00:01:22.550> knife<00:01:22.819> him<00:01:23.030> a<00:01:23.119> knife<00:01:23.300> so

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
it could even knife him a knife so

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:24.639 
it could even knife him a knife so
bounce<00:01:23.690> off<00:01:23.899> of<00:01:24.080> him<00:01:24.200> you'll<00:01:24.349> see<00:01:24.470> that<00:01:24.590> a
