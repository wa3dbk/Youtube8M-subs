00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:06.390
 dear friends hello in this video 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.389
 talk about wages and an increase in its 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.090
 how to request a salary increase and in general 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.620
 how to raise your salary we will 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.929
 series of videos on this topic 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.510
 let's start with the fact that when you 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.240
 work u come work on 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.609
 some work you agree to 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.189
 certain pay which 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.279
 spelled out in your contract for which you 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:33.559
 agreed and you start working 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:36.329
 it takes some time and for some reason people 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:38.489
 waiting for the rise that is, it is considered 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.510
 give such a strange feeling to people 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:45.270
 that I came to a salary of 30,000 rubles I 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.829
 worked for six months or a year, they do not 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.649
 must improve wages 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.690
 well there is such a thing as inflation and 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.420
 many organizations simply index 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.449
 your salary regardless of your 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.710
 merit and caught up simply due to inflation 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:00.870
 practically company news in which 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.449
 I worked this indexation was the day 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.210
 even talk about nothing but for some reason people 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.850
 believe that here I came a year ago 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.100
 started work work work doing 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.900
 That same year was not necessarily 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.659
 should raise wages at all seemed 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.280
 why why should you be 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.470
 raise salary if you have a year or 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.200
 two or 10 worked here just think 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.900
 what are you here from sitting worked no 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.850
 no in this logic, so firstly 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.680
 you must understand for yourself why he 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.750
 should raise the salary at all if it 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.119
 some objective reasons or not years 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.759
 just your and what I do not have to 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:39.240
 buy yourself a new car when you 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:42.030
 understand the reasons for example you have become more 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.270
 do you mean you guys are private 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.640
 added responsibilities guys here this 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.840
 very often argument 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.909
 I have tied up 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.590
 duties there it is it I have entrusted everything 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.930
 doing this 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:56.180
 They raised the salary of the guys usually 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.250
 as it happens a little bit the other way around if 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.080
 you already do this let's say for 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.670
 For half a year, wait for you 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.290
 raise wages is stupid enough 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.800
 because you have not agreed to give and 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.959
 motives are already doing it is illogical 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:12.290
 why here people a million times were me 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:14.239
 such questions then addressing i like 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.100
 I got thrown in there somewhere I now want 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:18.290
 go ask for a pay raise but 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.239
 that's stupid why didn't you ask then 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.660
 boost when they throw it all at you 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:26.060
 you could say i won't do it 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.700
 or I will if you would increase the salary 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.660
 or how to discuss the condition but when you 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.950
 already undertook it you already do it and 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.200
 spends some time with you becoming 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.930
 you need to pay extra for it no one 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.489
 should not give agreed therefore all 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.350
 question regarding salary 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:44.060
 need to discuss timely and before 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.920
 than agreeing on something you need everything 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.940
 discuss this one this in my very 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.459
 obvious moment 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.320
 Further moment connected with the fact that well 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:54.530
 ok let's say everything happens here you are 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.150
 do all you have a lot of work no 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.060
 duties just you work 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.410
 normal mode and here you understand but 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.209
 I would like to have 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.100
 salary is more than I can for this 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.959
 to make 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.239
 you must first be open with 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.070
 yours with that person who accepts 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:11.840
 financial decision your 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.720
 leader or you started groups or 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.730
 someone you need from you this idea came 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.130
 their heads and thought a little abdumalik 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.260
 come and talk about it and there is not 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.930
 it's a normal desire to have more 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.360
 West of it is nothing but you should 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:29.329
 come with some ideas should come up 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:32.329
 for a minute you know, I wanted to 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:35.090
 there was a salary higher because of something bent 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:38.090
 Now let's say I take it there 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.980
 mortgage and credit or you have some 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.079
 and I want to buy a new car or 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.980
 thirst don't want to eat any to this 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:49.530
 compelling reason and you suggest 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:51.720
 Some ideas in the gas note I turn 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:56.640
 I want my salary raised 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:58.860
 I propose, for example, new ones; 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.380
 only that which is different but still 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.030
 this this this and this well that's how you are at it 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.250
 see this is a normal situation you 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.830
 send you suggest a man who 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:09.420
 make a decision he thinks he will say no 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:12.110
 You know that this is not necessary but 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.730
 but there may be something like that 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.889
 different options are all situations 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:20.010
 very unique organizations are different 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:22.200
 so you can when you are voiced 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.830
 desire a pay rise you can 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:27.060
 even say you know i'm ready for example 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.740
 performing part of the function of some 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.360
 Generally another department 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.760
 for example i still know english i 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.430
 I can be your company translator 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.620
 additionally on saturdays well somewhere 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.330
 that is, you fall down yourself to offer not 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.220
 just now i'm sitting here my own 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.990
 do a piece of work and let's 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.479
 raise my salary for him no I 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.880
 can something else i can and this i can you 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:49.860
 I can translate such to you 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.770
 conference site I can still something 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:55.020
 do but name is extra charge 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:59.010
 so maybe you will find one 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:01.500
 way of making but just sit and pro 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:04.680
 especially loved and the desire for benefits 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:07.770
 favorite feature of people is sitting silently 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.870
 be silent be displeased and think like 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.760
 I do not pay a salary do not raise 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.260
 no one knows what you want 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.030
 he raised maybe you sit 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.690
 happy who knows about this 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.229
 speak 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:20.669
 first second to apply for promotion 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:22.770
 salaries are generally discussed for the fact that 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:24.780
 ask to even discuss your promotion 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:27.600
 wage need to have for this 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.760
 reason for some reason think 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.800
 what grounds do you have to visit 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.110
 reasons I can advise you 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.390
 some concrete examples let's 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:39.110
 We will discuss them in a separate video but 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:42.330
 basis must be but 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:45.860
 last and probably you know the most 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:48.060
 what is called all-in option this 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:51.090
 move to another job with 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:53.850
 increase but before drilling 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:55.440
 go rural ask well. 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.350
 did did another sentence in 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.510
 companies need 

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:00.280
 work place yes and so on you are given 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:01.750
 another job offer 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.460
 for example you need a sitting job offer 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:06.790
 come to your boss these here 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:09.670
 so therefore I now suggest that it is the 

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:10.960
 can we inside our company like that 

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:13.630
 adjust my salary 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:16.180
 so that I feel comfortable and and 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:18.670
 In general, with pleasure there were guys 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:21.190
 often it is possible 

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:23.290
 volt but often seriously often but 

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:25.180
 also often it happens so 

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:27.910
 impossible and then you are denied 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:29.890
 and you just change jobs here 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:31.510
 need to understand what you are ready to go that 

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:32.110
 you want what matters to you first 

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:34.390
 turn 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:37.360
 and of course in no case 

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:39.970
 blackmail there leadership some 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.440
 type gates that you have something to offer and on 

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:43.000
 in fact, you were not offered because 

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.100
 if it seems wrong all this 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.720
 sure to find out the labor market he is 

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:50.620
 it seems that he is so big and in fact 

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:52.720
 In fact, everyone knows why it's better all the same 

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.910
 how do you say everything if you say so 

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:57.850
 what are you leaving 

00:06:53.910 --> 00:07:00.310
 you know and let me there something so 

00:06:57.850 --> 00:07:02.170
 guys need to be consistent in all 

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:03.790
