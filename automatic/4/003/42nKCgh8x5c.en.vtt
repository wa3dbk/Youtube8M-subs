 users begin to have difficulty 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.420

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.800
 otherwise you will have to 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.220
 to spend a few cents to 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.350

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.860
 simulator 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.439
 here there is not a single simulator in the 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.990
 home button looks only here I can 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.630
 see it anywhere in the 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.050
 my screen that is in the corners 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.610
 I'm going to leave it down here, then. 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:16.450

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.480

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:38.020
 volume all those other functions 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.940
 the buttons on the outside of the appliance are 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.220
 so this is it here 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.709

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.380
