turn it and right away that corkscrew

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.189 
turn it and right away that corkscrew
device<00:00:55.860> catches<00:00:56.370> on<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.579> it<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.809> go<00:00:57.960> down

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
device catches on to it and you go down

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.590 
device catches on to it and you go down
not<00:00:58.829> all<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.190> way<00:00:59.309> you<00:00:59.370> let<00:00:59.789> a<00:00:59.820> little<00:01:00.030> bit<00:01:00.539> of

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
not all the way you let a little bit of

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.900 
not all the way you let a little bit of
the<00:01:00.870> corkscrew<00:01:01.320> device<00:01:01.620> hang<00:01:01.949> out<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.430> then

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
the corkscrew device hang out and then

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.850 
the corkscrew device hang out and then
the<00:01:03.000> next<00:01:03.239> step<00:01:03.420> is<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:04.049> put<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.379> hook<00:01:04.619> in<00:01:04.650> the

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
the next step is to put the hook in the

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.500 
the next step is to put the hook in the
right<00:01:05.040> spot<00:01:05.369> through<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.670> plastic<00:01:05.909> so<00:01:06.360> that

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
right spot through the plastic so that

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.230 
right spot through the plastic so that
it<00:01:06.600> lays<00:01:06.750> straight<00:01:07.140> in<00:01:07.740> this<00:01:07.950> case<00:01:08.250> I<00:01:08.520> want<00:01:09.119> to

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
it lays straight in this case I want to

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.390 
it lays straight in this case I want to
hook<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:09.510> actually<00:01:09.840> be<00:01:09.990> exposed<00:01:10.439> because

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
hook to actually be exposed because

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.640 
hook to actually be exposed because
these<00:01:11.580> pike<00:01:11.850> are<00:01:12.030> very<00:01:12.180> aggressive<00:01:12.530> so<00:01:13.530> I'm

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
these pike are very aggressive so I'm

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.700 
these pike are very aggressive so I'm
going<00:01:13.860> to<00:01:13.920> go<00:01:14.460> down<00:01:14.700> into<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.810> belly<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.530> the

going to go down into the belly of the

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.300 
going to go down into the belly of the
bait<00:01:17.070> go<00:01:18.060> up<00:01:18.299> through<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.810> top<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.409> then<00:01:20.130> it's

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
bait go up through the top and then it's

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.980 
bait go up through the top and then it's
going<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.580> come<00:01:20.759> out<00:01:20.939> so<00:01:21.540> that's<00:01:21.750> set

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
going to come out so that's set

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.320 
going to come out so that's set
perfectly<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:23.250> can<00:01:23.430> see<00:01:23.610> that<00:01:23.790> it's<00:01:23.939> straight

weeds<00:01:39.119> it's<00:01:39.450> probably<00:01:39.780> go<00:01:39.869> over<00:01:40.229> that<00:01:40.380> but<00:01:40.860> as

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
weeds it's probably go over that but as

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.530 
weeds it's probably go over that but as
soon<00:01:41.100> as<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.340> pike<00:01:41.549> clamps<00:01:42.000> down<00:01:42.060> on<00:01:42.240> that

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
soon as the pike clamps down on that

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.030 
soon as the pike clamps down on that
it's<00:01:42.750> so<00:01:42.869> flexible<00:01:43.110> that<00:01:43.470> it's<00:01:43.710> gonna<00:01:43.890> get

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
it's so flexible that it's gonna get

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.920 
it's so flexible that it's gonna get
poking<00:01:44.399> it's<00:01:44.549> small<00:01:44.759> now<00:01:45.299> these<00:01:45.479> types<00:01:45.780> of

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
poking it's small now these types of

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.810 
poking it's small now these types of
hooks<00:01:46.049> come<00:01:46.320> in<00:01:46.439> two<00:01:46.590> configuration<00:01:47.369> this<00:01:47.579> one

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
hooks come in two configuration this one

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.850 
hooks come in two configuration this one
here<00:01:48.090> is<00:01:48.180> unweighted<00:01:48.630> so<00:01:49.320> you<00:01:49.380> can<00:01:49.590> see<00:01:49.740> it's

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
here is unweighted so you can see it's

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.170 
here is unweighted so you can see it's
designed<00:01:50.130> to<00:01:50.189> be<00:01:50.340> fishing<00:01:50.520> in<00:01:50.670> shallow<00:01:50.729> water

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
designed to be fishing in shallow water

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.450 
designed to be fishing in shallow water
or<00:01:51.689> you<00:01:51.990> can<00:01:52.020> add<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:52.560> if<00:01:52.710> you're<00:01:52.920> tipping<00:01:53.310> it

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
or you can add it if you're tipping it

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.520 
or you can add it if you're tipping it
onto<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:53.909> large<00:01:54.210> spinner<00:01:54.630> blade<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:54.990> spinner

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
onto a large spinner blade a spinner

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.380 
onto a large spinner blade a spinner
bait<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:55.950> so<00:01:56.159> on<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.880> other<00:01:57.000> one<00:01:57.180> that<00:01:57.299> I've

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
bait and so on the other one that I've

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.870 
bait and so on the other one that I've
got<00:01:57.570> here<00:01:57.869> is<00:01:57.990> actually<00:01:58.469> weighted<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.040> I<00:01:59.610> like

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
got here is actually weighted and I like

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.880 
got here is actually weighted and I like
what<00:02:00.030> they've<00:02:00.180> done<00:02:00.210> because<00:02:00.689> that<00:02:00.930> weight<00:02:01.619> is

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
what they've done because that weight is

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.639 
what they've done because that weight is
like<00:02:02.579> a<00:02:02.610> triangular<00:02:03.420> shape<00:02:03.750> so<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:04.409> can

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
like a triangular shape so you can

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.980 
like a triangular shape so you can
actually<00:02:04.829> turn<00:02:05.490> it<00:02:05.700> if<00:02:05.939> your<00:02:06.210> swim<00:02:06.479> bait<00:02:06.689> isn't

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
actually turn it if your swim bait isn't

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.719 
actually turn it if your swim bait isn't
swimming<00:02:07.350> just<00:02:07.530> right<00:02:07.829> for<00:02:08.129> some<00:02:08.340> reason<00:02:08.610> it's

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
swimming just right for some reason it's

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.820 
swimming just right for some reason it's
on<00:02:08.879> one<00:02:09.119> side<00:02:09.420> they<00:02:10.050> give<00:02:10.229> you<00:02:10.289> instructions

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
on one side they give you instructions

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:11.880 
on one side they give you instructions
in<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.069> back

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
in the back

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.650 
in the back
you<00:02:11.950> can<00:02:12.130> actually<00:02:12.310> turn<00:02:12.819> that<00:02:12.880> weight<00:02:13.360> one

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
you can actually turn that weight one

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.930 
you can actually turn that weight one
way<00:02:13.870> or<00:02:14.020> the<00:02:14.140> other<00:02:14.170> or<00:02:14.590> even<00:02:15.010> slide<00:02:15.730> it

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
way or the other or even slide it

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.390 
way or the other or even slide it
further<00:02:16.240> up<00:02:16.330> or<00:02:16.660> further<00:02:17.110> down<00:02:17.410> the<00:02:17.650> hook<00:02:17.860> so

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
further up or further down the hook so

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.280 
further up or further down the hook so
that<00:02:18.430> it's<00:02:18.670> balanced<00:02:19.150> just<00:02:19.360> right<00:02:19.480> because

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
that it's balanced just right because

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.960 
that it's balanced just right because
the<00:02:20.410> way<00:02:20.530> you<00:02:20.590> want<00:02:20.890> these<00:02:21.040> swimbaits<00:02:21.580> to<00:02:21.760> come

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
the way you want these swimbaits to come

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.270 
the way you want these swimbaits to come
through<00:02:22.150> the<00:02:22.270> water<00:02:22.480> is<00:02:22.959> naturally<00:02:23.800> you<00:02:24.100> want

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
through the water is naturally you want

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.880 
through the water is naturally you want
the<00:02:24.400> belly<00:02:24.580> down<00:02:24.850> in<00:02:25.150> the<00:02:25.600> back<00:02:25.780> like<00:02:26.500> that<00:02:26.680> on

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
the belly down in the back like that on

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.410 
the belly down in the back like that on
top<00:02:27.100> so<00:02:27.700> they're<00:02:27.819> coming<00:02:28.090> through<00:02:28.120> like<00:02:28.390> a

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
top so they're coming through like a

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.730 
top so they're coming through like a
real<00:02:28.660> fish<00:02:28.900> and<00:02:29.050> all<00:02:29.140> the<00:02:29.260> action<00:02:29.620> really

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
real fish and all the action really

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.949 
real fish and all the action really
comes<00:02:30.040> from<00:02:30.100> the<00:02:30.250> back<00:02:30.490> this<00:02:31.150> tail<00:02:31.450> because<00:02:31.810> as

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
comes from the back this tail because as

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:34.500 
comes from the back this tail because as
a<00:02:31.990> paddle<00:02:32.410> tail<00:02:32.590> slaps<00:02:33.340> back<00:02:33.670> and<00:02:33.970> forth<00:02:34.240> and

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
a paddle tail slaps back and forth and

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.700 
a paddle tail slaps back and forth and
it<00:02:34.900> seems<00:02:35.170> to<00:02:35.350> be<00:02:35.470> irresistible<00:02:35.890> to<00:02:36.490> fish
