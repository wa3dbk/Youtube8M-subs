little bit shorter than my right rein
and<00:00:19.260> then<00:00:20.260> I<00:00:20.350> want<00:00:20.529> to<00:00:20.619> make<00:00:20.860> sure<00:00:21.070> that<00:00:21.220> I<00:00:21.279> have

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:21.760 
and then I want to make sure that I have

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.210 
and then I want to make sure that I have
a<00:00:22.060> hand<00:00:22.660> right<00:00:22.900> on<00:00:23.110> the<00:00:23.380> withers<00:00:23.650> here<00:00:23.920> and

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:26.110 
instead of grabbing on to hair I just

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.380 
instead of grabbing on to hair I just
prefer<00:00:26.650> to<00:00:26.680> make<00:00:27.520> a<00:00:27.550> little<00:00:27.759> arch<00:00:27.970> like<00:00:28.180> this
