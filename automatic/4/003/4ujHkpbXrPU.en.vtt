00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.730
 hello everyone with you arthur if 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:26.599
 tell you how i am 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:29.529
 I measure diagonals and take off others 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:37.690
 I have dimensions for this 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:43.430
 basic three tools simple tape measure 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:47.690
 simple building level and mine 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:49.970
 diagonal fixture for 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:54.640
 uncomfortable places that is metric here 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:56.739
 ruler hole to fit and and 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:03.620
 adjustments 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:06.860
 up and down and so i will show on 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:10.369
 this subaru forester 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:13.600
 here already body did show how 

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:13.600
 take measurements 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:23.520
 so I measure the roulette in the main 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:26.130
 diagonal and distance from kick the points 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:32.220
 where it is possible to make a tape measure 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:36.180
 It is convenient and easy to take it here 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:39.470
 acceptable. and you can take it here 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.510
 take here if the glass is damaged 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:46.230
 here it is dangerous here maybe a little 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:49.290
 no coincidence but the main solid point 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:57.780
 I will be measured here as the measure 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:02:05.400
 diagonally admissible from point a and 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:11.030
 measure this this or this also must 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:14.030
 be equally diagonal and on the other 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.030
 parties 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:24.090
 that is what was on that side then 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:28.650
 should be and on this here here and 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:31.350
 here you have an even diagonal that's not 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:35.790
 means that what else can be exactly 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.830
 different distances from points i usually is 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.990
 I measure 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:45.270
 from a pot or some other 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:48.780
 checkpoint also measure acceptable 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:51.750
 I measure here the mount of the headlight mount 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.060
 TV but the center point too 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:58.080
 good 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:03:01.040
 that's the main distance i mean this 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:04.040
 side should be a similar story 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.040
 So 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.650
 now we measure my header 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:14.550
 tool this tool is basically 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:19.470
 I take you Girona where with a tape measure 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:24.060
 come not so that there are opportunities 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:31.480
 this is done very simply again take 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:34.150
 point and as you can see dancing pointed this 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.800
 in order to be able either to bolt 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:42.030
 either here 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:44.260
 either some point some point 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:48.150
 from here if 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:04:00.540
 fret adjust here there is a size 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:04:09.959
 it means like the video here is 188 least here too 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:15.720
 188 how when a broken car means 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:18.790
 measure the size difference but you need to know 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:25.230
 this width 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:27.450
 spars it is recognized beam which 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:33.280
 for bumper 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:35.260
 if the difference is 2 centimeters two 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.590
 spars then naturally you need 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.590
 half 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.730
 pull in the opposite direction 

00:04:57.409 --> 00:05:04.039
 so using simple construction 

00:04:59.809 --> 00:05:06.080
 name level measuring mainly height 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:09.229
 spars high fat can be and 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.749
 another measure but I'm used to sur le 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:14.300
 mean we do 

00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:16.389
 if not damaged glasses for LCD 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:20.899
 whatever you want to call it 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:23.269
 measure on him the news private here everything 

00:05:20.899 --> 00:05:29.829
 it is screwed so i'm just for us 

00:05:23.269 --> 00:05:33.379
 show do so put level 

00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:34.699
 measure what the same wheel can be 

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:38.919
 soil anything else 

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:38.919
 that is, it should be like this 

00:05:39.309 --> 00:05:51.729
 the result can also be here as 

00:05:49.429 --> 00:05:56.079
 see the height is almost the same 

00:05:51.729 --> 00:06:01.490
 you can also change the height 

00:05:56.079 --> 00:06:07.849
 spars tape measure as possible 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:12.889
 make take a checkpoint let's say 

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:19.869
 mount for the top takes the floor measure 

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:19.869
 here is how we see 54 centimeters 

00:06:20.019 --> 00:06:23.019
 we measure 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:34.860
 the other side here is fifty two with 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:37.950
 by half we know the difference so 5450 of you 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:43.290
 there is one and a half centimeters does not mean 

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:49.170
 measure also here and here that is 

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:54.270
 the difference should be something there 

00:06:49.170 --> 00:07:01.640
 here perhaps all my basic methods 

00:06:54.270 --> 00:07:01.640
 measurements yet
