00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:28.059 

to<00:03:12.590> come<00:03:12.890> first<00:03:13.459> and<00:03:26.560> don't<00:03:27.560> forget<00:03:27.769> this<00:03:27.890> is<00:03:28.040> a

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
to come first and don't forget this is a

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:31.690 
to come first and don't forget this is a
side<00:03:28.340> that<00:03:28.909> I<00:03:28.940> had<00:03:29.209> to<00:03:29.480> that<00:03:30.319> I<00:03:30.409> cut<00:03:30.739> because<00:03:31.609> I

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
side that I had to that I cut because I

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.910 
side that I had to that I cut because I
had<00:03:31.879> some<00:03:32.090> damage<00:03:32.870> so<00:03:33.079> I<00:03:33.230> just<00:03:33.379> took<00:03:33.590> this<00:03:33.709> is

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
had some damage so I just took this is

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.220 
had some damage so I just took this is
I'm<00:03:34.129> just<00:03:34.450> -<00:03:35.450> it<00:03:35.780> out

I'm just - it out

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:39.610 
I'm just - it out
figured<00:03:36.680> it'll<00:03:37.430> grow<00:03:37.609> back<00:03:37.760> faster<00:03:38.620> and

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
figured it'll grow back faster and

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.369 
figured it'll grow back faster and
everything<00:03:39.950> were<00:03:40.129> healthy<00:03:40.840> all<00:03:41.840> right

00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:42.379 
everything were healthy all right
