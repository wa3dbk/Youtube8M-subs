00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
and out in and out and so that came with

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.060 
and out in and out and so that came with
what<00:00:50.010> it's<00:00:50.129> doing<00:00:50.489> is<00:00:50.640> it's<00:00:50.789> either<00:00:50.940> making

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
what it's doing is it's either making

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.479 
what it's doing is it's either making
mixing<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.160> little<00:00:53.340> bit<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.640> hot<00:00:53.820> water<00:00:53.960> into

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
mixing a little bit of hot water into

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:57.950 
mixing a little bit of hot water into
into<00:00:56.489> your<00:00:56.520> cooling<00:00:56.940> system<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.480> kind<00:00:57.690> of<00:00:57.750> warm

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
into your cooling system to kind of warm

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.660 
into your cooling system to kind of warm
it<00:00:58.079> up<00:00:58.199> or<00:00:58.500> if<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:58.770> put<00:00:58.890> it<00:00:59.039> all<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.280> way<00:00:59.309> cold

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
it up or if you put it all the way cold

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.299 
it up or if you put it all the way cold
it<00:00:59.910> cuts<00:01:00.300> off<00:01:00.510> all<00:01:00.719> that<00:01:00.840> hot<00:01:01.050> water<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.620> then

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
it cuts off all that hot water and then

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.979 
it cuts off all that hot water and then
that<00:01:02.550> allows<00:01:02.699> your<00:01:03.059> air<00:01:03.239> conditioning<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.870> get

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
that allows your air conditioning to get

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.350 
that allows your air conditioning to get
cold<00:01:04.260> well<00:01:06.140> if<00:01:07.140> that<00:01:07.590> cable<00:01:08.189> is<00:01:08.460> not<00:01:08.760> adjusted

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
cold well if that cable is not adjusted

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.810 
cold well if that cable is not adjusted
right<00:01:09.540> or<00:01:09.810> after<00:01:10.200> let's<00:01:10.680> say<00:01:10.799> mine<00:01:11.100> is<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.280> 96

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
right or after let's say mine is a 96

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.350 
right or after let's say mine is a 96
landcruiser<00:01:12.240> after<00:01:12.659> 17<00:01:13.200> years<00:01:13.500> that<00:01:14.369> cable

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
landcruiser after 17 years that cable

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.570 
landcruiser after 17 years that cable
kind<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.689> got<00:01:15.860> slipped<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.100> slipped<00:01:17.340> and

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
kind of got slipped and slipped and

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.010 
kind of got slipped and slipped and
slipped<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.939> little<00:01:18.060> bit<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.450> where<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:18.720> was<00:01:18.840> now

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
slipped a little bit to where it was now

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.530 
slipped a little bit to where it was now
a<00:01:19.049> half<00:01:19.500> inch<00:01:19.770> out<00:01:20.040> of<00:01:20.400> where<00:01:21.150> it<00:01:21.240> should<00:01:21.420> have

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
a half inch out of where it should have

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.330 
a half inch out of where it should have
been<00:01:21.689> so<00:01:22.320> what<00:01:22.439> was<00:01:22.560> happening<00:01:23.009> is<00:01:23.130> when<00:01:23.310> I

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
been so what was happening is when I

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.890 
been so what was happening is when I
would<00:01:23.460> put<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.939> air<00:01:24.150> conditioning<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.750> the

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
would put the air conditioning to the

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.380 
would put the air conditioning to the
coldest<00:01:25.290> setting<00:01:25.680> it<00:01:26.159> still<00:01:26.610> would<00:01:26.909> allow<00:01:27.360> a

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
coldest setting it still would allow a

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.179 
coldest setting it still would allow a
little<00:01:27.630> bit<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:27.900> that<00:01:27.960> warm<00:01:28.259> air<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.710> mix<00:01:28.979> in

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
little bit of that warm air to mix in

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.969 
little bit of that warm air to mix in
with<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.340> air<00:01:29.549> conditioning<00:01:30.799> doing<00:01:31.799> that

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
with the air conditioning doing that

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.039 
with the air conditioning doing that
doesn't<00:01:32.759> let<00:01:33.210> your<00:01:33.329> air<00:01:33.450> condition<00:01:33.810> get<00:01:33.930> as

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
doesn't let your air condition get as

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.899 
doesn't let your air condition get as
cold<00:01:34.229> as<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.530> should<00:01:34.590> I<00:01:34.950> made<00:01:35.340> some<00:01:35.549> mistakes

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
cold as you should I made some mistakes

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.080 
cold as you should I made some mistakes
I<00:01:36.180> actually<00:01:36.810> went<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.290> a/c<00:01:38.040> place<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:38.970> had

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
I actually went to a a/c place and had

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.149 
I actually went to a a/c place and had
them<00:01:39.270> recharge<00:01:39.869> my<00:01:40.170> air<00:01:40.290> conditioning<00:01:40.890> check

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
them recharge my air conditioning check

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.130 
them recharge my air conditioning check
it<00:01:41.310> out<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.850> of<00:01:41.939> course<00:01:42.299> they<00:01:42.720> said<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.020> was

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
it out and of course they said it was

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.889 
it out and of course they said it was
great<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.770> it<00:01:44.399> just<00:01:44.729> in<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.119> Arizona<00:01:45.479> Sun<00:01:45.570> it

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
great and it just in the Arizona Sun it

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.109 
great and it just in the Arizona Sun it
really<00:01:46.229> wasn't<00:01:46.500> that<00:01:46.829> great<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:47.250> was<00:01:47.399> cool<00:01:47.759> but

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
really wasn't that great it was cool but

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.330 
really wasn't that great it was cool but
it<00:01:48.180> wasn't<00:01:48.509> as<00:01:48.600> cold<00:01:48.780> as<00:01:48.960> it<00:01:49.079> should<00:01:49.290> be<00:01:49.470> so<00:01:49.649> I'm

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
it wasn't as cold as it should be so I'm

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.440 
it wasn't as cold as it should be so I'm
going<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.490> show<00:01:50.640> you<00:01:50.670> how<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:50.909> fix<00:01:51.119> that<00:01:51.270> here

over<00:01:53.790> there<00:01:53.909> is<00:01:54.060> pointed<00:01:54.479> we're<00:01:55.200> on<00:01:55.409> the

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
over there is pointed we're on the

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.920 
over there is pointed we're on the
firewall<00:01:56.100> of<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.880> landcruiser<00:01:57.420> here<00:01:57.750> and

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
firewall of the landcruiser here and

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.080 
firewall of the landcruiser here and
this<00:01:58.500> is<00:01:58.649> your<00:01:58.770> mixing<00:01:59.159> valve<00:01:59.369> right<00:01:59.610> here<00:01:59.880> and

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
this is your mixing valve right here and

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.190 
this is your mixing valve right here and
then<00:02:01.020> down<00:02:01.320> here<00:02:01.380> is<00:02:02.360> the<00:02:03.360> mechanism<00:02:03.689> the

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
then down here is the mechanism the

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.560 
then down here is the mechanism the
cable<00:02:04.560> that<00:02:04.710> pulls<00:02:04.950> in<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.340> out<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:06.180> if<00:02:06.420> you

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
cable that pulls in and out and if you

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.760 
cable that pulls in and out and if you
see<00:02:06.780> right<00:02:06.960> here<00:02:07.020> you<00:02:08.090> will<00:02:09.090> have<00:02:09.530> you'll<00:02:10.530> have

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
down and that will give to a proper

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.949 
down and that will give to a proper
amount<00:02:28.950> adjustment<00:02:29.489> to<00:02:29.670> the<00:02:29.910> cable<00:02:30.299> and<00:02:30.480> then

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
amount adjustment to the cable and then
