00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:01.819
 continue to work on the post 

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:03.460
 2000 subject to our close 

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.540
 attention will turn and so here if 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.570
 the price for this date is in order 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:10.370
 undoubted dignity 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:11.990
 sliding gate is one 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:13.799
 that they do not need to be given a special place 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.440
 gate leaf moves 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.270
 directly along the guide along 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:17.960
 fence 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.779
 which is especially true on the plots 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:22.380
 I do not have much space most often three pilots 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.480
 specially processed 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.380
 profile time that will provide 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.029
 sliding gates reliability and 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:27.860
 durability 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.880
 door leaf is prepared from the profile 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.840
 rugged sandwich panels 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.360
 time you surface is very 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.480
 resistant to atmospheric 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.700
 impact stiffness 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.440
 sliding gate constructions attach 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.880
 steel bearing beams there can no longer 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.130
 be of any size 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.260
 the lack of data checks does 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.260
 possible uezd same large 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.690
 transport any owner of one house 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.250
 for car dreams of valuable breeds 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.030
 they are practical then I don't occupy space 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.080
 home citizens because it is very reliable 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.820
 in the federation tell the news 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.920
 cultures are sectional doors themselves as 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.010
 most reliable and efficient 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.309
 construction of industrial garage doors 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:05.289
 they are applicable 

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:07.309
 for all types of openings these notes and coins 

00:01:07.309 --> 00:01:10.249
 which premises are all the way around they require 

00:01:10.249 --> 00:01:12.450
 plenty of indoor space cautious 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.629
 does not take any 

00:01:13.629 --> 00:01:15.119
 spaces they work 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.460
 as follows sandwich panel 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.720
 mean between themselves so that they can 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:20.799
 move along guides 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:22.830
 respectively freeing or 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:23.670
 close year 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.100
 in the room management 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.040
 performed by 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.100
 mechanical and electrical 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.740
 drive in which include one 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:30.790
 release buttons 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.240
 and specially switch 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.540
 sectional gate can be installed neither 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.480
 on a small private cinema garage large 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.770
 warehouse or hangar for aircraft their size 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.719
 reaches eight meters in length 

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:42.809
 and up to six meters tall yes maybe 

00:01:42.809 --> 00:01:44.340
 anywhere long remains 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.340
 colorful 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.640
 they do not spare the money do not need to upgrade 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.510
 structure system for over fifty years 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.560
 at this security level they will graduate 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.000
 practical installation lessons as well 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.890
 15 couple went to shipbuilders 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.510
 write down the company's candidates shrunk 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.540
 sometimes so from now on and sectional 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.150
 security by the highest 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:05.560
