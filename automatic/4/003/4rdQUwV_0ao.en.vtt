00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:15.280
 we are talking about the basics of 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.810
 human rights where they come from 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.290
 these rights how do they achieve 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:22.420
 finally be reflected in a 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:27.730
 constitution or in the text of a treaty 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:29.650
 we were saying recently that there is 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.340
 different explanations there are different 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:36.850
 ways to justify this historically 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:39.250
 one of the fundamentals that has 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:42.550
 had greater impact and greater relevance 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:45.460
 in this subject is what we call the 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:48.070
 foundation natural law or 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.079
 naturalist of human rights in 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.480
 that is based this kind of 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:54.670
 foundation has its origin in 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.730
 remote times when there was no 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.070
 separation between churches or the 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:03.339
 religion in general and the powers 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:05.650
 public when faith was united 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:08.170
 religious and the exercise of power 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.909
 political and in this sense it 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.979
 justified 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.990
 to human rights from a point of 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:16.840
 naturalist view appealing to two 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.770
 arguments the first of them what 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.959
 been qualified as the natural law 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.600
 theological said that human rights 

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:27.939
 come from god that there is a divinity 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.369
 as each religion understands it 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:33.099
 naturally in a different way but there 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:35.859
 a divinity that gives us the 

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:38.649
 rights that gives us the rights to 

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:40.780
 that we as human beings created 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:43.619
 also for that divinity we can 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.899
 enjoy them in our daily life 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:50.679
 has a second slope this 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:54.209
 naturalist foundation or natural law 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:57.009
 notes that rights are inherent 

00:01:54.209 --> 00:02:00.129
 precisely to human nature this 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:03.729
 is that we have rights for the 

00:02:00.129 --> 00:02:06.069
 simple fact of existing of being people 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.780
 and actually what the texts do 

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:10.840
 constitutional or treaties 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:14.200
 international is not granting us those 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.300
 rights but simply recognize 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.940
 rights that we already have 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.730
 according to this explanation there would be 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:25.150
 as a kind of genetics in the 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:28.600
 human beings propitious or adequate for 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:32.860
 have rights in this regard it would look 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.900
 as something and indisputable as something not 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.720
 subject to contingencies of character 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.150
 temporary or political nature which 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.520
 we have these rights but that 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:46.210
 would come rather from nature 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:49.090
 human understood as rational beings 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:51.280
 that allows us to distinguish us from others 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.760
 species that inhabit the planet 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:58.330
 land this would be of course a great 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:01.260
 traits the naturalistic foundation of 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.260
 human rights
