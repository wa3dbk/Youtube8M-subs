I'm just using me clash with an MSR and
speed<00:00:34.320> position<00:00:34.860> see<00:00:35.010> so<00:00:35.190> i<00:00:35.280> can<00:00:35.460> run<00:00:35.700> quicker

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
speed position see so i can run quicker

quiz on running over here to this oil

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.270 
quiz on running over here to this oil
pan<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.850> pretty<00:00:45.809> good<00:00:45.989> spot<00:00:46.200> for<00:00:46.260> private<00:00:47.070> match

but<00:00:47.610> if<00:00:47.730> you're<00:00:47.879> going<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.059> be<00:00:48.180> doing<00:00:48.329> this

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
but if you're going to be doing this

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.350 
but if you're going to be doing this
online<00:00:48.750> i<00:00:49.170> suggest<00:00:49.710> that<00:00:49.800> you<00:00:49.920> lay<00:00:50.219> down<00:00:50.360> so

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
online i suggest that you lay down so

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.810 
online i suggest that you lay down so
they<00:00:51.719> hopefully<00:00:52.530> miss<00:00:53.190> you<00:00:53.370> would<00:00:53.550> throw

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
they hopefully miss you would throw

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.209 
they hopefully miss you would throw
knives<00:00:54.120> because<00:00:54.440> this<00:00:55.440> bar<00:00:55.739> would<00:00:55.920> just<00:00:55.980> be<00:00:56.190> a

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
knives because this bar would just be a

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.459 
knives because this bar would just be a
pain<00:00:56.430> dance<00:00:56.730> after<00:00:57.120> walk<00:00:57.329> forward<00:00:57.899> it<00:00:58.020> back<00:00:58.230> to

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
pain dance after walk forward it back to

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.310 
pain dance after walk forward it back to
avoid<00:00:58.829> throwing<00:00:59.070> honestly<00:01:00.020> they<00:01:01.020> can<00:01:01.230> only

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
avoid throwing honestly they can only

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.049 
avoid throwing honestly they can only
come<00:01:01.620> from<00:01:01.649> one<00:01:02.010> spot<00:01:02.309> that's<00:01:02.640> right<00:01:02.820> there

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
come from one spot that's right there

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.810 
come from one spot that's right there
and<00:01:03.359> stand<00:01:04.229> on<00:01:04.409> that<00:01:04.559> orange<00:01:05.010> bar<00:01:05.280> than<00:01:05.549> here

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
and stand on that orange bar than here

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.420 
and stand on that orange bar than here

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
of the plane oh yeah so there's two ways

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.289 
of the plane oh yeah so there's two ways
to<00:01:14.640> do<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.150> however<00:01:15.689> this<00:01:15.960> try<00:01:16.439> i<00:01:16.470> failed<00:01:17.299> yeah

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
but the way i'll get it in the next time

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.520 
but the way i'll get it in the next time
next<00:01:20.520> time<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:20.820> threat<00:01:21.090> but<00:01:21.840> right<00:01:22.080> here<00:01:22.320> all

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.069 
right on top of the point and there you
go<00:01:29.250> then<00:01:29.610> they<00:01:29.850> should<00:01:30.119> only<00:01:30.299> be<00:01:30.540> looking<00:01:30.900> from

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
go then they should only be looking from

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.170 
go then they should only be looking from
one<00:01:31.229> spot<00:01:31.500> if<00:01:31.710> they<00:01:31.860> don't<00:01:32.070> know<00:01:32.220> how<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:32.820> do

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
one spot if they don't know how to do

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.289 
one spot if they don't know how to do
this<00:01:33.210> way<00:01:33.689> read<00:01:34.409> this<00:01:34.560> one<00:01:34.950> crouch<00:01:35.549> jump<00:01:36.000> and

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
this way read this one crouch jump and

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.920 
this way read this one crouch jump and
then<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:37.049> can<00:01:37.200> land<00:01:37.380> up<00:01:37.500> onto<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.920> plane<00:01:38.070> but

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
then you can land up onto the plane but

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.810 
then you can land up onto the plane but
players<00:01:39.930> hope<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.320> land<00:01:40.530> if<00:01:40.740> you<00:01:40.979> stay<00:01:41.549> all

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
the way on the back of the wing then you

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.130 
the way on the back of the wing then you
should<00:01:45.060> be<00:01:45.240> able<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.479> pick<00:01:45.630> them<00:01:45.780> off<00:01:45.899> as

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
should be able to pick them off as

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.649 
should be able to pick them off as
they're<00:01:46.500> climbing<00:01:47.040> up<00:01:47.159> there<00:01:47.399> oh<00:01:48.110> yeah<00:01:49.110> so

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
moving on to the next quiz I'm going to

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.319 
moving on to the next quiz I'm going to
get<00:01:55.200> onto<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.680> plane<00:01:55.920> it's<00:01:56.670> very<00:01:56.969> simple

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
get onto the plane it's very simple

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.929 
get onto the plane it's very simple
however<00:01:57.930> very<00:01:58.409> hard<00:01:58.710> for<00:01:58.979> some<00:01:59.159> people<00:01:59.369> I'm

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939

all<00:02:00.509> you<00:02:00.600> have<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.810> do<00:02:00.960> is<00:02:01.110> jump<00:02:01.380> exactly<00:02:01.619> where

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
all you have to do is jump exactly where

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.210 
all you have to do is jump exactly where
I<00:02:02.250> do<00:02:02.450> jump<00:02:03.450> back<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.200> back<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.159> less

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
I do jump back and back and less

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.080 
I do jump back and back and less
will<00:02:06.850> hold<00:02:07.150> back<00:02:07.480> and<00:02:07.720> up<00:02:07.900> to<00:02:08.080> the<00:02:08.110> same<00:02:08.440> time

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
will hold back and up to the same time

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.840 
will hold back and up to the same time
it<00:02:10.090> could<00:02:10.330> be<00:02:10.390> cool<00:02:10.899> like<00:02:11.380> I<00:02:11.650> I<00:02:12.160> suggest<00:02:12.700> you

right here then they can jump nice you
but<00:03:09.490> that's<00:03:09.580> only<00:03:09.760> if<00:03:09.910> throw<00:03:10.150> on<00:03:10.239> a<00:03:10.269> second

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
but that's only if throw on a second

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.729 
but that's only if throw on a second
part<00:03:10.959> oh<00:03:11.310> yeah<00:03:12.310> so<00:03:12.670> moving<00:03:13.660> on<00:03:13.780> this<00:03:14.050> this<00:03:14.500> book

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739 
part oh yeah so moving on this this book

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:16.800 
part oh yeah so moving on this this book
right<00:03:15.100> here<00:03:15.160> is<00:03:15.519> very<00:03:15.880> good<00:03:16.209> for<00:03:16.390> online

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
right here is very good for online

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.470 
right here is very good for online
because<00:03:17.170> it<00:03:17.739> will<00:03:18.070> be<00:03:18.190> very<00:03:18.430> hard<00:03:18.820> to<00:03:19.000> throwing

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
because it will be very hard to throwing

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.330 
because it will be very hard to throwing
knife<00:03:19.660> you<00:03:19.900> and<00:03:20.140> they<00:03:20.260> can<00:03:20.440> only<00:03:20.590> come<00:03:20.890> for<00:03:21.130> one

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
knife you and they can only come for one

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.440 
knife you and they can only come for one
direction<00:03:23.489> well<00:03:24.489> that's<00:03:24.700> obviously<00:03:25.239> if

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
direction well that's obviously if

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.750 
direction well that's obviously if
you're<00:03:25.630> moving<00:03:26.170> of<00:03:26.320> course<00:03:26.590> at<00:03:26.860> the<00:03:27.040> only<00:03:27.370> that

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
you're moving of course at the only that

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.300 
you're moving of course at the only that
it<00:03:28.600> will<00:03:28.720> be<00:03:28.840> hard<00:03:29.080> to<00:03:29.170> sort<00:03:29.350> of<00:03:29.410> grow<00:03:29.769> in<00:03:29.920> a<00:03:30.040> few

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
it will be hard to sort of grow in a few

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.790 
it will be hard to sort of grow in a few
and<00:03:30.550> moving<00:03:30.910> on<00:03:31.209> right<00:03:32.050> here<00:03:32.290> I<00:03:32.350> just<00:03:32.470> go<00:03:32.769> to

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:32.800 
and moving on right here I just go to

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.770 
and moving on right here I just go to
the<00:03:33.070> vending<00:03:33.280> machine<00:03:33.760> and<00:03:33.910> get<00:03:33.970> a<00:03:34.030> quick<00:03:34.239> soda

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
I love it that works on any any vending

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.340 
I love it that works on any any vending
machine<00:03:40.120> even<00:03:40.600> though<00:03:40.720> when<00:03:40.840> it's<00:03:41.019> laying

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
machine even though when it's laying

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.090 
machine even though when it's laying
down<00:03:41.620> sideways<00:03:42.160> oven<00:03:43.110> but<00:03:44.110> for<00:03:44.320> this<00:03:44.440> question

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:45.100 
down sideways oven but for this question

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:47.250 
down sideways oven but for this question
I<00:03:45.310> haven't<00:03:45.670> tested<00:03:45.910> cell<00:03:46.450> yet<00:03:46.660> if<00:03:46.780> they<00:03:46.930> can

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
I haven't tested cell yet if they can

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.440 
I haven't tested cell yet if they can
nice<00:03:47.560> view<00:03:47.860> but<00:03:48.100> I'm<00:03:48.220> almost<00:03:48.610> positive<00:03:49.000> that

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
nice view but I'm almost positive that

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.840 
nice view but I'm almost positive that
