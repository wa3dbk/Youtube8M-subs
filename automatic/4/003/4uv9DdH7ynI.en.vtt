00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:17.359 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:20.779 

okay<00:00:18.359> so<00:00:18.470> exchange<00:00:19.470> variation<00:00:19.859> can<00:00:20.760> I

possibly<00:00:21.600> mess<00:00:22.289> this<00:00:22.529> up<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:23.789> correct<00:00:24.150> answer

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
possibly mess this up the correct answer

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:48.720 
possibly mess this up the correct answer
is<00:00:24.750> of<00:00:25.199> course<00:00:25.230> yes

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:57.599 

yeah

00:00:57.599 --> 00:00:57.609 

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:02.610 

okay<00:00:58.239> so<00:01:00.960> advantage<00:01:01.960> to<00:01:02.170> having<00:01:02.440> this

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
okay so advantage to having this

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.369 
okay so advantage to having this
terrible<00:01:03.159> bishop<00:01:03.609> is<00:01:03.760> that<00:01:04.030> it<00:01:04.570> will<00:01:04.869> act<00:01:05.140> as<00:01:05.320> a

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
terrible bishop is that it will act as a

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.469 
terrible bishop is that it will act as a
temporary<00:01:05.740> shield<00:01:06.189> for<00:01:06.610> me<00:01:06.640> to<00:01:06.820> double<00:01:07.180> on<00:01:07.270> the

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:07.479 
temporary shield for me to double on the

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:19.890 
temporary shield for me to double on the
evil

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:28.890 

okay<00:01:20.650> I<00:01:20.680> like<00:01:21.460> now<00:01:22.150> I<00:01:22.180> think<00:01:26.970> that<00:01:27.970> is<00:01:28.450> even

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
okay I like now I think that is even

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:36.100 
okay I like now I think that is even
better<00:01:29.110> for<00:01:29.500> me<00:01:29.920> I<00:01:30.040> think

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:46.980 

okay<00:01:38.200> not<00:01:39.850> 100%<00:01:40.850> sure<00:01:40.970> what<00:01:41.300> this<00:01:41.810> does<00:01:44.200> beep

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
okay not 100% sure what this does beep

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.570 
okay not 100% sure what this does beep
don't<00:01:47.990> usually<00:01:48.200> see<00:01:48.560> level<00:01:48.830> eight<00:01:48.950> blunder

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
don't usually see level eight blunder

00:01:49.580 --> 00:02:07.109 
don't usually see level eight blunder
this<00:01:49.760> bad<00:01:50.090> with<00:01:50.360> a<00:01:54.850> rare<00:01:55.850> chance<00:01:56.210> in<00:01:56.690> being

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.119 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:16.380 

okay<00:02:07.719> so<00:02:07.780> now<00:02:08.229> I<00:02:08.259> want<00:02:08.679> control<00:02:08.950> of<00:02:09.280> e5<00:02:15.180> I'm<00:02:16.180> off

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
okay so now I want control of e5 I'm off

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:33.180 
okay so now I want control of e5 I'm off
like<00:02:16.629> a<00:02:16.660> couple<00:02:17.019> pieces<00:02:17.530> even<00:02:18.310> is<00:02:18.489> that

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:42.020 

and

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.540 

so<00:02:42.660> this<00:02:42.930> should<00:02:43.110> just<00:02:43.140> be<00:02:43.410> a<00:02:43.530> grind<00:02:43.950> out<00:02:44.190> to<00:02:44.520> a

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
so this should just be a grind out to a

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.950 
so this should just be a grind out to a
win<00:02:46.880> I've<00:02:47.880> been<00:02:48.060> doing<00:02:48.270> too<00:02:48.420> great
