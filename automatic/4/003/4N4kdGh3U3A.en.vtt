00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
favorite spot on the farm is a pond that

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.229 
favorite spot on the farm is a pond that
we<00:03:36.200> dug<00:03:36.830> in<00:03:38.200> 2006<00:03:39.200> it<00:03:39.650> was<00:03:39.860> a<00:03:39.890> poorly<00:03:40.820> drained

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239

we dug in 2006 it was a poorly drained
corn<00:03:41.660> field<00:03:41.959> and<00:03:42.370> we<00:03:43.370> thought<00:03:43.610> if<00:03:43.790> we<00:03:43.820> drain

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
corn field and we thought if we drain

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:46.150 
corn field and we thought if we drain
part<00:03:44.540> of<00:03:44.720> it<00:03:44.810> we<00:03:44.930> could<00:03:45.110> plant<00:03:45.380> trees<00:03:45.739> on<00:03:46.010> the

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
part of it we could plant trees on the

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.130 
part of it we could plant trees on the
other<00:03:46.310> part<00:03:46.640> we<00:03:47.150> ended<00:03:47.330> up<00:03:47.450> with<00:03:47.630> a<00:03:47.660> very<00:03:47.900> nice

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
other part we ended up with a very nice

other part we ended up with a very nice
feature<00:03:48.530> that<00:03:48.760> that<00:03:49.760> now<00:03:49.970> has<00:03:50.209> fishing<00:03:50.840> for

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050 
feature that that now has fishing for

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.040 
feature that that now has fishing for
grandchildren<00:03:51.380> and<00:03:51.920> and<00:03:52.670> is<00:03:53.300> aesthetically

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050 
grandchildren and and is aesthetically

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.800 
grandchildren and and is aesthetically
very<00:03:54.410> nice<00:03:54.650> I<00:03:55.010> think<00:03:55.459> our<00:03:55.640> opportunity<00:03:56.330> here

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
very nice I think our opportunity here

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.190 
very nice I think our opportunity here
is<00:03:57.050> more<00:03:57.440> of<00:03:57.530> an<00:03:57.620> educational<00:03:58.780> value<00:03:59.780> that's

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
is more of an educational value that's

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.020 
is more of an educational value that's
that's<00:04:00.620> what<00:04:00.830> we<00:04:00.980> bring<00:04:01.220> to<00:04:01.280> the<00:04:01.489> table<00:04:01.670> to
