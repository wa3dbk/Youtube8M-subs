 People are going to separate the clear from Jenna. 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.770
 people use only the agenda in this mix 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:16.350
 is that everything is going to be put together and it's time to 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:19.770
 put your hands dirty and do arise there 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.960

 release the hand plateau already well 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.470
 Just hang around so you're already turned 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:32.130
 mass you will even begin to 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:36.540
 distribute this dough in the 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:42.420
 home and start doing this I'll get one 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:47.190
 the mass and I will distribute 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:49.380
 inside the farm is tightening well try 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.990
 leave the bottom very thin for the dough 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.930
 look pretty good I like a border 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.030
 a little bit thicker but you 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.009
 You can make it very happy if you want. 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.790
 Then you'll go straight to school. 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:05.750
 forminha with the same fingers and then is 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.750
 just cut the edges 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:16.109
 now distribute all the mass in the 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.060
 I'll make mistakes, I'll make mistakes. 

00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:19.200
 What if I explain about this but I go 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.299
 tell you 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.349
 the amount of each ingredient I 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:25.290
 I hope to do my 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:29.969
 I use a can or a milk carton 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.319
 condensed 4 5 tablespoons of sugar and two 

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:33.569
 spoons of margarine 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:44.459
 So let's make Brigadier is the party. 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:47.010
 more java ready to start 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.409
 distribute on ants nachos 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.299
 I'm leaving you a little more 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:53.310
 than the common brigadeiro because the 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.989
 People are going to take this mass to the fire. 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:03:05.849
 then it will get a little harder 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:19.319
 It's still not that, we're still going 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:21.120
 close is accurate so I can open the 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:22.889
 rest of the mass left over I go 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.840
 make some balls with a family 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:28.409
 a little less just to cover 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:32.909
 There you will make the pies. 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:36.979
 balls and then just get it out and that's it. 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:36.979
 cover the family with the mass 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:52.360
 all 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:55.060
 now that the animal I'm going to take 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:57.820
 This is to pass in a preheated oven to 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:01.510
 200 and 30 degrees for 30 minutes 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:03.720
 while waiting for 90 christie's 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:08.170

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:12.220
 You got ready 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:13.720
 slightly larger size 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.220
 but you can use those smaller ones 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.930
 Neighbors will not give a 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:20.440
 slightly larger amount 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:23.680
 and to gratify my sympathy if I 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:26.260
 I used the chocolate most like it on top. 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.900
 and put a little granulate 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:33.480
 It was delicious too. 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.480
 and this is the best part of the video 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.270
