 2 storage karabÃ¡tic includes its own client torrent 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:29.879
 the storage of data in daily use demand more and more capacity 

00:00:29.879 --> 00:00:33.710
 the files are larger and the backups outside the computer 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:34.309
 work 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:37.320
 they are almost a necessity 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.730

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.800

 use it as a torrent client 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.630
 in terms of design the tlc n the unemployed presents us with very 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.430
 Careful and in accordance with any decoration 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.710
 the noise that is almost priceless 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.910
 and the consumption estimated 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.150
 This device has an ethernet connection for access to the 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.340
 local network a terna two vcp ports to connect external disks for memories 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.290
 very selective where the automatic layer 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.370
 that creates a backup of the device that we have connected 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:37.530
 next to tlc n 2 to 2 a software is included from which to be able 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.010
 to leave all its functions and configuration similar to that of an outbreak 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.880
 and it is that through web browsers you can configure jorge vara cabo 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.130
 any action of this month although to manage files we can also 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.130
 use in windows explorer 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.720
 about managing backup you have to say little 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.310
 just like others of its kind, it is enough to connect in your own Wi-Fi network and 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.999
 select the destination 

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:18.270
 However, scenes have a very interesting addition 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.189
 they have a torrent client integrated 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:26.069
 avoid having to be invited to a pc or laptop consuming much less 500 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:27.179
 conventional 

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:30.179
 d 60 

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:56.019
 one of the advantages of having a misstep that we can store everything 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:57.120
 type of files 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.109
 was the PC and access them from any computer and location 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:03.340
 so for that 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.370
 he has two to two have a web server that we have from the 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:08.540
 Eastern servers 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.869
 and that allows us to see files by managing them anywhere 

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:13.999
 or device 

00:03:13.999 --> 00:03:18.259
 in such a way that just by typing in the browser the address offered by 

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:19.679
 the taste of the product 

00:03:19.679 --> 00:03:23.509
 we can see with downloading any storage file 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:31.989
 workers in conclusion in configurarequipos we believe that the 279 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:33.430
 euros that is worth scenes 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.130
 It is very good for the benefits it offers, however, we still think that 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.750
 For this type of devices to reach a domestic level the 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.560
 manufacturers should lower prices a bit and make them more spec a civil 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.040
 said this a greeting
