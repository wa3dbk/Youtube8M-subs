seems like it could focus here for a
moment

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
moment

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.170 
moment
gonna<00:01:31.950> have<00:01:32.070> some<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.400> ports<00:01:32.759> here<00:01:33.000> it

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
gonna have some of the ports here it

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.910 
gonna have some of the ports here it
looks<00:01:33.329> like<00:01:33.420> an<00:01:33.630> SD<00:01:33.960> card<00:01:33.990> slot<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.530> micro<00:01:34.890> USB

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
looks like an SD card slot a micro USB

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.190 
looks like an SD card slot a micro USB
port<00:01:35.400> three<00:01:35.970> half<00:01:36.150> millimeter<00:01:36.600> headset<00:01:36.990> jack

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
port three half millimeter headset jack

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.080 
port three half millimeter headset jack
in<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:38.009> rear<00:01:38.220> we<00:01:38.460> have<00:01:38.490> some<00:01:38.880> additional

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
in the rear we have some additional

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.149 
in the rear we have some additional
ports<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:39.900> looks<00:01:40.049> like<00:01:40.229> you<00:01:40.380> have<00:01:40.500> your<00:01:40.680> HDMI

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
ports it looks like you have your HDMI

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.440 
ports it looks like you have your HDMI
out<00:01:41.939> port

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
out port

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.230 
out port
so<00:01:44.170> HDMI<00:01:44.770> ports<00:01:45.189> works<00:01:45.610> like<00:01:45.790> a<00:01:45.820> land

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
so HDMI ports works like a land

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.380 
so HDMI ports works like a land
connection<00:01:46.689> also<00:01:47.530> as<00:01:47.650> well<00:01:47.890> 3<00:01:48.580> nanometer<00:01:49.210> had

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
connection also as well 3 nanometer had
