00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
with the taste of defeat and there's

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.490 
with the taste of defeat and there's
something<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.539> be<00:00:54.660> said<00:00:54.690> for<00:00:54.899> that<00:00:55.079> coming

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
something to be said for that coming

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.650 
something to be said for that coming
into<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:56.489> game<00:00:56.640> against<00:00:56.940> Wisconsin's<00:00:57.570> they

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
into the game against Wisconsin's they

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.299 
into the game against Wisconsin's they
know<00:00:57.809> how<00:00:57.989> bad<00:00:58.260> they<00:00:58.500> want<00:00:58.829> it<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:59.070> they

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
know how bad they want it and they

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.950 
know how bad they want it and they
didn't<00:00:59.640> get<00:00:59.850> it<00:00:59.969> last<00:01:00.210> year<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.539> so<00:01:00.809> I<00:01:00.840> do

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
didn't get it last year and so I do

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.479 
didn't get it last year and so I do
think<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:01.350> that<00:01:01.469> can<00:01:01.739> help<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.039> Wildcats

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
think that that can help the Wildcats

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.210 
think that that can help the Wildcats
it's<00:01:02.940> not<00:01:03.149> necessarily<00:01:03.660> revenge<00:01:04.220> against

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
it's not necessarily revenge against

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.710 
it's not necessarily revenge against
Wisconsin<00:01:05.790> I<00:01:05.850> didn't<00:01:06.000> get<00:01:06.060> that<00:01:06.119> sense<00:01:06.510> today

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.240 
Wisconsin I didn't get that sense today
and<00:01:07.020> hearing<00:01:07.260> from<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.530> players<00:01:07.770> it's<00:01:08.040> more

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
and hearing from the players it's more

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.039 
and hearing from the players it's more
of<00:01:08.400> they<00:01:08.580> know<00:01:08.760> what<00:01:09.030> today<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.299> all<00:01:09.510> about<00:01:09.570> and

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
of they know what today is all about and

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.810 
of they know what today is all about and
tomorrow<00:01:10.350> is<00:01:10.530> all<00:01:10.680> about<00:01:10.950> that's<00:01:11.549> trying<00:01:11.790> to

both teams are very efficient
offensively<00:01:15.360> but<00:01:15.900> I<00:01:15.990> think<00:01:16.200> defensively<00:01:16.530> we

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
offensively but I think defensively we

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.859 
offensively but I think defensively we
got<00:01:17.189> an<00:01:17.340> interesting<00:01:17.580> situation<00:01:18.270> here<00:01:18.659> the

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
calling card Wisconsin's defense is not

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.810 
calling card Wisconsin's defense is not

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
think it's amazing to think now that

we're looking at wisconsin more of an

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.499 
we're looking at wisconsin more of an
offensively<00:01:38.130> minded<00:01:38.759> team<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.180> that's<00:01:39.299> the

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
offensively minded team and that's the

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.450 
offensively minded team and that's the
worry<00:01:39.750> that<00:01:39.869> you<00:01:40.140> have<00:01:40.320> against<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:41.070> badgers

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
worry that you have against the badgers

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.670 
worry that you have against the badgers
this<00:01:41.640> year<00:01:41.880> but<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.509> breakdowns<00:01:42.960> can<00:01:43.229> be<00:01:43.380> seen

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
this year but the breakdowns can be seen

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.319 
this year but the breakdowns can be seen
on<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.950> guard<00:01:44.310> play<00:01:44.579> i<00:01:44.610> think<00:01:44.939> there's<00:01:45.149> some

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
on the guard play i think there's some

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.359 
on the guard play i think there's some
opportunity<00:01:45.479> for<00:01:46.079> arizona's<00:01:46.590> TJ<00:01:46.890> mcconnell

Gabe<00:01:47.939> York<00:01:48.299> Stanley<00:01:48.720> Johnson<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.290> be<00:01:49.380> able<00:01:49.439> to

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
Gabe York Stanley Johnson to be able to

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.260 
Gabe York Stanley Johnson to be able to
break<00:01:49.860> down<00:01:50.100> some<00:01:50.460> of<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.640> guards<00:01:50.939> I<00:01:51.060> like

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
break down some of the guards I like

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.510 
break down some of the guards I like
John<00:01:51.570> gosser<00:01:52.079> with<00:01:52.530> his<00:01:52.649> ability<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:53.159> guard

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
John gosser with his ability to guard

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.280 
John gosser with his ability to guard
one-on-one<00:01:54.360> but<00:01:54.570> I<00:01:54.630> think<00:01:54.930> there's<00:01:55.110> some

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
one-on-one but I think there's some

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.170 
one-on-one but I think there's some
ability<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:55.890> get<00:01:56.040> to<00:01:56.219> Bronson<00:01:56.640> Koenig<00:01:56.850> and

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
ability to get to Bronson Koenig and

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.609 
ability to get to Bronson Koenig and
some<00:01:57.600> of<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.750> other<00:01:57.930> players<00:01:58.200> on<00:01:58.469> the

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
some of the other players on the

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.530 
some of the other players on the
perimeter<00:01:58.890> Arizona<00:01:59.850> has<00:02:00.030> typically<00:02:00.420> been

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
perimeter Arizona has typically been

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.990 
perimeter Arizona has typically been
looked<00:02:00.930> at<00:02:01.110> as<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.320> frontline<00:02:01.740> team<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.700> front

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
looked at as a frontline team the front

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.789 
looked at as a frontline team the front
lines<00:02:03.240> match<00:02:03.540> up<00:02:03.780> very<00:02:03.810> well<00:02:04.110> I<00:02:04.290> think<00:02:04.530> the

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
lines match up very well I think the

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.920 
lines match up very well I think the
guards<00:02:05.159> for<00:02:05.369> Arizona<00:02:05.850> could<00:02:06.450> be<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.750> key<00:02:06.899> to

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
guards for Arizona could be the key to

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.139 
guards for Arizona could be the key to
the<00:02:07.170> Wildcat<00:02:07.560> win<00:02:07.799> look<00:02:08.369> back<00:02:08.580> at<00:02:08.729> last<00:02:08.940> year's

kind of like that I think Arizona is a

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.949 
kind of like that I think Arizona is a
better<00:02:27.340> team<00:02:27.640> right<00:02:27.670> now<00:02:27.940> than<00:02:28.599> it<00:02:28.690> was<00:02:28.720> a<00:02:28.870> year

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
better team right now than it was a year

ago yeah at this stage of the game
Arizona<00:02:31.060> is<00:02:31.180> I<00:02:31.480> think<00:02:31.540> a<00:02:31.840> most<00:02:32.140> much<00:02:32.590> better

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
Arizona is I think a most much better

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.920 
Arizona is I think a most much better
offensive<00:02:33.340> team<00:02:33.549> Stanley<00:02:34.180> Johnson<00:02:34.360> brings<00:02:34.810> a

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
whole lot of offense to the table and we

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:38.430 
whole lot of offense to the table and we
have<00:02:36.970> seen<00:02:37.239> Brandon<00:02:37.420> Ashley<00:02:37.810> in<00:02:38.140> the<00:02:38.230> last

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
have seen Brandon Ashley in the last

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.680 
have seen Brandon Ashley in the last

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.539 
month play his best basketball of his
Arizona<00:02:41.140> career<00:02:41.560> especially<00:02:41.920> on<00:02:42.430> the

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
Arizona career especially on the

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:44.309 
Arizona career especially on the
offensive<00:02:42.579> end<00:02:43.209> he<00:02:43.750> could<00:02:43.900> be<00:02:44.019> a<00:02:44.049> game<00:02:44.290> changer

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
offensive end he could be a game changer

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.349 
offensive end he could be a game changer
for<00:02:44.859> Arizona<00:02:45.310> to<00:02:45.730> be<00:02:45.819> able<00:02:46.000> to<00:02:46.060> stretch

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:46.359 
for Arizona to be able to stretch

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:47.880 
for Arizona to be able to stretch
Wisconsin<00:02:47.049> out<00:02:47.170> a<00:02:47.200> little<00:02:47.440> bit<00:02:47.590> with<00:02:47.769> his

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
Wisconsin out a little bit with his

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.710 
Wisconsin out a little bit with his

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
ability to shoot the ball and he's got

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.140 
ability to shoot the ball and he's got
great<00:02:49.959> length<00:02:50.290> inside<00:02:50.769> I<00:02:50.829> think<00:02:51.250> Arizona<00:02:51.549> has

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
great length inside I think Arizona has

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.000 
great length inside I think Arizona has
some<00:02:52.540> great<00:02:52.780> offensive<00:02:53.170> weapons<00:02:53.680> with<00:02:53.829> those

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
some great offensive weapons with those

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.550 
some great offensive weapons with those
