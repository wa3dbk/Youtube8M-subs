because a lot of people thought it

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:45.689 
because a lot of people thought it
wouldn't<00:00:44.739> work<00:00:44.920> because<00:00:45.129> we<00:00:45.489> couldn't

wouldn't work because we couldn't

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:47.879 
wouldn't work because we couldn't
advertise<00:00:45.999> it<00:00:46.539> we<00:00:47.139> couldn't<00:00:47.469> create<00:00:47.710> a

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:47.889 
advertise it we couldn't create a

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:50.309

commercial<00:00:48.690> thrust<00:00:49.690> to<00:00:49.839> it<00:00:49.929> and<00:00:49.989> I<00:00:50.049> said<00:00:50.109> but

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:50.319 
commercial thrust to it and I said but

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:51.389 
commercial thrust to it and I said but
that's<00:00:50.440> not<00:00:50.620> what<00:00:50.859> this<00:00:50.979> is<00:00:51.039> going<00:00:51.219> to<00:00:51.309> be

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:51.399 
that's not what this is going to be

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:52.439 
that's not what this is going to be
about<00:00:51.460> it's<00:00:51.729> not<00:00:51.850> gonna<00:00:51.969> be<00:00:52.089> about<00:00:52.239> what's

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:52.449

commercial I wouldn't want to make that

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.879

decision it's going to be about what's

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:58.829 
decision it's going to be about what's
out<00:00:57.039> there<00:00:57.309> well<00:00:57.670> the<00:00:57.909> diversity<00:00:58.539> of<00:00:58.569> this

00:00:58.829 --> 00:00:58.839 
out there well the diversity of this

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:00.750 
out there well the diversity of this
culture<00:00:59.079> that<00:00:59.469> has<00:00:59.589> been<00:00:59.769> minimized<00:01:00.339> by<00:01:00.609> how

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
culture that has been minimized by how

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.549 
culture that has been minimized by how
the<00:01:00.819> mainstream<00:01:01.600> has<00:01:01.959> been<00:01:02.170> delivering

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
the mainstream has been delivering

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:04.350 
the mainstream has been delivering
product<00:01:03.010> so<00:01:03.129> maybe<00:01:03.369> we<00:01:03.549> can<00:01:03.699> fill<00:01:03.940> in<00:01:04.089> the<00:01:04.180> gap

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
product so maybe we can fill in the gap

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.210 
product so maybe we can fill in the gap
there<00:01:04.629> by<00:01:04.840> providing<00:01:05.320> an<00:01:05.530> alternative<00:01:05.620> with

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
there by providing an alternative with

there by providing an alternative with
other<00:01:06.700> voices<00:01:07.120> and<00:01:07.540> we<00:01:07.870> had<00:01:08.020> a<00:01:08.050> few<00:01:08.290> films<00:01:08.620> and

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890

a<00:01:08.980> few<00:01:09.250> people<00:01:09.550> wandering<00:01:09.880> around<00:01:10.030> the<00:01:10.210> street

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:10.510 
a few people wandering around the street

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.480 
a few people wandering around the street
to<00:01:11.050> get<00:01:11.170> them<00:01:11.470> into<00:01:11.710> the<00:01:11.740> Egyptian<00:01:12.220> theater

to get them into the Egyptian theater

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:13.800 
to get them into the Egyptian theater
and<00:01:12.610> that's<00:01:12.730> how<00:01:12.850> it<00:01:12.940> all<00:01:13.030> started<00:01:13.390> now<00:01:13.510> it's<00:01:13.690> a

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
and that's how it all started now it's a

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.960 
and that's how it all started now it's a
different<00:01:14.230> ballgame<00:01:14.410> it<00:01:14.770> is<00:01:14.920> indeed<00:01:15.280> Robert

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
different ballgame it is indeed Robert

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.360 
different ballgame it is indeed Robert
this<00:01:16.000> of<00:01:16.240> course<00:01:16.270> is<00:01:16.540> an<00:01:17.440> election<00:01:17.830> year<00:01:17.980> do

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:18.370 
this of course is an election year do

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.250 
this of course is an election year do
you<00:01:18.460> feel<00:01:18.700> that<00:01:18.880> filmmakers<00:01:19.300> perhaps<00:01:19.990> more

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:20.260 
you feel that filmmakers perhaps more

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.410 
you feel that filmmakers perhaps more
than<00:01:20.290> politicians<00:01:20.860> are<00:01:21.610> providing<00:01:22.150> a<00:01:22.240> voice

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
than politicians are providing a voice

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.780 
than politicians are providing a voice
to<00:01:22.600> people<00:01:22.630> yeah<00:01:23.080> I<00:01:23.230> think<00:01:23.320> filmmakers<00:01:24.280> can

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
to people yeah I think filmmakers can

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.660 
to people yeah I think filmmakers can
tell<00:01:25.330> stories<00:01:25.960> about<00:01:26.260> the<00:01:26.800> American<00:01:27.310> country

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
tell stories about the American country

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 
we're living in it sometimes are more

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.260 
we're living in it sometimes are more
realistic<00:01:29.980> and<00:01:30.130> more<00:01:30.280> truthful<00:01:30.730> than<00:01:30.760> what<00:01:31.120> we

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
realistic and more truthful than what we
