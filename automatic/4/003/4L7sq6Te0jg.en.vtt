00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.470
 take the picture 

00:00:08.829 --> 00:00:10.649
 also in front 

00:00:10.649 --> 00:00:13.049
 more very liberal 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.049
 a comfort for me and movies 

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:19.579
 because the photograph 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.900
 about the prehistory nor the posthumous custom 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.380
 and at the moment and 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.909
 and from there 

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:33.359
 no commitment mass scenes can come has consequences 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.580
 the photo will find Volker four-legged PETA to pick anything 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.250
 so much a present one 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.380
 by definition Belarus 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.080
 the arrested present 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.080
 I believe that old cameras with the negative 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.070
 have the photographer 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.420
 because he anticipated what he could not verify 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.050
 because he had to rely on the relationship Dieter happened to light what 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:10.710
 it happened there 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.690
 and me in the back of my mind 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.690
 that could still be a bit too high screws 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.070
 I believe there 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.510
 you have to get involved differently 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.570
 You also have to get involved in the landscape differently when you're docking 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.740
 photographed 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.049
 and that was only once what you photographed Kontron enlarge 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.820
 very good Philipp had a prototype of 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.930
 since he himself was in the hand that was somewhere to March he will be 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.410
 photographed between the old one 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.000
 new digital is 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.120
 the polaroid but 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.540
 Of course, it was unique 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.670
 and especially as 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.020
 Chicken manipulatable Smital in the end, too 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.850
 Immediately if already added 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.850
 come that it has been invented 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.880
 At that time, many winters also write in his car 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.489
 to shoot kitsch 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.079
 and then he says it's up in Nitra 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:15.059
 what you saw 

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:18.059
 Koch Watzke says something similar 

00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:23.249
 and he was a prophet 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:37.699
 in their work downwards meadows demanded the city Rheine 

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:41.390
 After all, a photographer was our time away 

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:42.939
 Country contemporaries charming 

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:45.249
 one of the fast 

00:02:45.249 --> 00:02:46.539
 but 

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:49.039
 after all, still able 

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:52.679
 So notice that he lives too fast and that he has accelerated too much 

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:57.199
 and that he hastened out of his own presence Ross 

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:59.279
 and to the 

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:02.279
 Present has no right to come 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:04.939
 and the 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:07.939
 He constantly goes for many photographers 

00:03:08.779 --> 00:03:13.269
 then while standing there with the camera b others earlier 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.299
 Photographic cameras have stood in the landscape or 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:18.159
 in front of a person 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:20.299
 but even if strange way 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:22.819
 not so present anymore 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:27.249
 the photographer did not want to have so much since his choice only halfway in his head 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:29.359
 in Sana'a 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:31.519
 Postproduction is already half 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:33.059
 shopping at the photo 

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:36.449
 or hawthorn 

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:39.129
 France can train and thus formally 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:42.129
 the roofs way that does not look good because then handed over to the gang 

00:03:43.029 --> 00:03:46.029
 Robes smart ears there promises 

00:03:52.749 --> 00:03:55.749
 over time, yes some 

00:03:56.999 --> 00:04:01.469
 some digital experiments also photographed places is each of these 

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:04.059
 Cameras I occupied here 

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:06.569
 further given away 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:08.859
 or given way 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:11.859
 because I did not know what to do with it anymore 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:17.220
 Copper Nickel had to do with the thing was the Zeitz 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.680
 disappear 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.290
 find that Pohl proven photography for me more and more clear 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:26.249
 the 

00:04:26.249 --> 00:04:29.740
 only now one should need and need 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:34.009
 the 

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:37.550
 to enjoy the moment or 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.550
 to savor because that can only take place and 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.680
 If you then hold all the chairs word must allow them to change something simple 

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:46.219
 hardest not 

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:47.710
 only more precious 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.710
 I am glad to take pictures 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:54.059
 is not meant 

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:56.210
 satisfied person since then not 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.210
 also take pictures 

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:06.629
 Kappes is photographing 

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:10.089
 Percy a confrontation with the transience 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.830
 lead this protocol 

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:16.129
 everything is improved 

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:19.129
 an examination of the transience 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.969
 digital photography gives 

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:25.020
 has a different relation to transience in the middle with 

00:05:25.019 --> 00:05:27.289
 public can also blur 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:29.300
 Children are 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:32.300

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.409
 translator 

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:39.409
 Interpreter has between the two areas 

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:42.050
 Pictures must be able to 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:45.050
 still invisible 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.669
 Pictures can certainly 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:51.189
 that which is visible 

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:54.189
 leave visible 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:57.999
 Bonn players can too 

00:05:57.999 --> 00:06:01.439
 can not reach the invisible in any way 

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:04.559
 though possible in the relationship i have myself once 

00:06:06.069 --> 00:06:08.930
 in concrete terms, this form did not exist 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:10.710
 Elections Australia 

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:15.199
 and wanted because he wishes that with which he turned to the end of the world 

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:15.780
 and the 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.780
 but the third goalkeeper Robert Enke will come too soon 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:22.889
 "I wanted to do that recently 

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:25.119
 and then 

00:06:25.119 --> 00:06:28.119
 got me 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.719
 also pleased

 Aldridge SV at City Gap replies KC forces

 At the very bottom Kriftel measured the wool until 10 

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:39.460

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:40.710
 there come

 she and the Eldor before 

00:06:42.869 --> 00:06:46.240
 they have died in the meantime 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.669
 when they realize that the ECD SC Islands appear 

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:51.309
 then 

00:06:51.309 --> 00:06:54.309
 if this is true Dancer place is so that in order 

00:06:54.949 --> 00:06:56.569
 recently Bach 

00:06:56.569 --> 00:06:59.569
 we are dead and it does not change anything that has to do with that 

00:07:01.009 --> 00:07:02.499
 there exist more 

00:07:02.499 --> 00:07:04.479
 Possessions become 

00:07:04.479 --> 00:07:06.449
 bolted or bolted 

00:07:06.449 --> 00:07:08.979
 for that is not what they wanted to give anyway 

00:07:08.979 --> 00:07:12.289
 Time offers the service to me 

00:07:12.289 --> 00:07:15.289
 Zwirner a room that's me 

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.159
 it became clear like that 

00:07:19.159 --> 00:07:21.449
 Imagination is and with 

00:07:21.449 --> 00:07:24.449
 how to deal with it 

00:07:28.749 --> 00:07:30.229
 there is life 

00:07:30.229 --> 00:07:32.339
 every photographer 

00:07:32.339 --> 00:07:35.339
 made at least as much un-made pictures 

00:07:36.339 --> 00:07:39.089
 and of course it happens again and again 

00:07:39.089 --> 00:07:42.089
 that one has been waiting for the gasoline gates from 

00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:45.999
 have you missed this second or 

00:07:45.999 --> 00:07:48.999
 demolished 10 2 seconds and wicked minute 

00:07:49.879 --> 00:07:53.319
 there you have the title and you can not do it 

00:07:53.319 --> 00:07:56.319
 but not all important pictures in the life of every photographer 

00:07:57.039 --> 00:08:00.949
 He did not do it but many pictures you do not do are us too 

00:08:00.949 --> 00:08:03.099
 well prepared 

00:08:03.099 --> 00:08:05.979
 good only that the Kickers then again and again
