been<00:00:55.510> a<00:00:55.539> long<00:00:55.780> time<00:00:55.809> so<00:00:56.199> I<00:00:56.319> played<00:00:56.620> on<00:00:56.829> on<00:00:57.730> this

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
been a long time so I played on on this

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.410 
been a long time so I played on on this
arcade<00:00:59.829> and<00:01:00.269> the<00:01:01.269> books<00:01:01.569> were<00:01:01.690> that<00:01:02.399> you

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
arcade and the books were that you

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.410 
arcade and the books were that you
sometimes<00:01:04.420> would<00:01:05.080> be<00:01:05.710> able<00:01:05.860> to<00:01:06.280> stand<00:01:07.090> in<00:01:07.390> one

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
sometimes would be able to stand in one

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.140 
sometimes would be able to stand in one
block<00:01:07.960> and<00:01:08.260> nothing<00:01:08.800> would<00:01:08.890> happen<00:01:09.100> and<00:01:09.400> the

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
block and nothing would happen and the

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.440 
block and nothing would happen and the
other<00:01:10.300> one<00:01:10.570> is<00:01:10.600> that<00:01:10.960> you<00:01:11.200> could<00:01:11.380> jump<00:01:11.770> on<00:01:12.390> on<00:01:13.390> a

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
other one is that you could jump on on a

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.860 
other one is that you could jump on on a
wall<00:01:14.260> like<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:15.640> walls<00:01:15.910> like<00:01:16.150> this<00:01:16.360> the

pillars<00:01:17.200> uh<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:19.140> it<00:01:20.140> would<00:01:20.530> eat<00:01:20.800> the<00:01:21.520> pillar

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
pillars uh and it would eat the pillar

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.680 
pillars uh and it would eat the pillar
like<00:01:22.630> if<00:01:22.810> you<00:01:22.930> were<00:01:23.050> standing<00:01:23.380> in<00:01:23.800> a<00:01:23.950> pillar<00:01:24.190> on
