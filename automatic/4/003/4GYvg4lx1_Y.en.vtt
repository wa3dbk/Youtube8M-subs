00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.870
 I asked him about my facebook page 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:32.029
 they love that mainly the idea 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.290
 It is a purse wallet or simply 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.420
 a holster for the school that 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.489
 simulation a book also easy and 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.240
 I hope you like it so much 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:42.590
 let's start with him 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.600
 the materials may seem a little 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.970
 hard to find but can 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.620
 be replaced by other things or the base 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.060
 It is a wooden box with this type of 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.130
 I bought it in a carpentry 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.950
 can use any box 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:57.320
 wooden or plastic similar to this one 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.150
 first step is to paint it for this from 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.650
 white acrylic paint to simulate the 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.650
 leaves and light blue for the lid 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.690
 print the logo on the lid and if I stay 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.820
 quite big equally after 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.470
 terrible but the idea is to mark it with the 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.630
 pencil and then paint it the color that 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.620
 corresponds to be very good as I did 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.620
 then why not 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.100
 while the paint dries we are going to 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.750
 create the inside part we go to 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.970
 specify two rectangles of fabrics 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.690
 measuring it this way we're going to put 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.790
 glue by the edges 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.440
 and folding our rectangle we're going to 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:37.270
 accommodate it so that the box can 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.270
 open up in this way 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.890
 until we step completely inside we're going 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.790
 to grab a ribbon cited and paste it to 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.790
 long in the middle 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.439
 s when we know where to paste the box 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.000
 magnet so that you can then escape from 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:55.400
 all 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.740
 we can also be the tramp caltrops 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.300
 etcetera and let's let them dry several 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.980
 hours later tapestries with two 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.430
 rectangles over fabric pro chords and 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.180
 ready helping me with glue 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.860
 we could leave it here if it is 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.840
 we want to dissolve the holster a 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.330
 box to store things but for 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.220
 can use it as a key portfolio 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.520
 ends of a string conchillos to the 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.350
 little houses 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.900
 and says for the end he wrote the text 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.940
 of the lid a black microfiber and a 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.780
 ballpoint pen in cream or white with that 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.780
 name I bought it 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.800
 and I put varnish to take care of more 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.630
 surface or leave it like this too 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.250
 Comment on each game in which of your books 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.250
 favorites would you like to make this idea 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.300
 the movie 

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.610
 by twitter 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:18.639
 and lion or the icon was suspended 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.639
 stretcher earrings
