00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:12.520
 welcome to a new video in which 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:14.920
 marc write or read that it would be a house 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:18.430
 It must be killing but with books for him 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:21.010
 something newer is done that is to say that 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.570
 good video is silent until 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.310
 dragged a while you get a new 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.230
 camera because ball turnadas some 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:29.289
 problems is our cameras that nothing 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.210
 I'm going to see me with this quality but 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:33.550
 it does not matter we're going to come back nothing happens 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.620
 does not strive camera so before 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.860
 at least the video is that I ask you 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:41.950
 Well, tell me about the previous video that 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.630
 it's a business they have a video so that 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.770
 can make the book of Cordoba that is 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.780
 very easy you only have to give 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.550
 like the video that went up to the book 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.920
 in your channel so the description will 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.360
 I leave the video or also here on the island or 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.460
 the video so if now we're going to 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.590
 start this stand consists of swimming 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.070
 our little pieces of paper with the names of 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.070
 the 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:06.449
 I have to choose 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.449
 the book read 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.340
 because only the balance 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.590
 and so I can describe what 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:17.370
 really so I'm going to mix first 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.370
 touch 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:27.820
 and 8 Leonel play because we're going 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:30.310
 when I drink obviously to see that 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.590
 reactivated and read and let's see I 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.600
 that more keys because yes that I do not 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.159
 like the three although I like me 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.619
 I like it a lot but I like the 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:41.439
 so people move and breathe today 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:43.550
 chop even though the book is beautiful what 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:45.980
 rewrite and at the end 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.320
 but good although we are going to end but in 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:51.180
 the profitability so 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.180
 it's hard 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.170
 fire accusations and the decision that 

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:04.619
 It's not that difficult although I love the 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.619
 three but the relay or the great fire 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.690
 and I do not want and I think I would receive 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.850
 pulsations because I did not like the ending 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.280
 for nothing but I do not want to burn the 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:18.480
 water choice because I love it that way 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.480
 that the bailongo 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:31.060
 deadly 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:34.150
 the park obviously already shuffled and 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.070
 I think the deadly plan would be written 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.230
 project that lacks the base the 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:41.810
 book be 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:44.510
 I do not know but theology 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:50.599
 so I would write that maria martÃ­ 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:53.750
 all three but I like it but I think 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:58.330
 that you do not need books 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:01.790
 insurgent aristÃ³teles and dante has already 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:08.940
 crashed this porn star 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:12.860
 they understood what I do so good 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.860
 obviously I read 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.560
 sorry but of course 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:32.250
 why insurgent I love all the 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:36.150
 book and I like it because obviously it has 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:39.239
 referred to these pilots but it is not more 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:42.060
 I love it but the days for discarding 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:44.849
 because it's not that there was insurgent what 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.930
 I would receive but you know that I liked them 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:47.930
 but yes 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:56.780
 maybe bones was called the fifth wave and 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.780
 to the power 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:06.629
 I think reread and the tree and the 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:11.930
 lottery obviously there I do not want that 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:11.930
 I come there is a place 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:21.359
 I think it would burn and not very bag but not 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:26.600
 it's because I do not like both the book 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:29.610
 but they have given us the themes and topics 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:32.190
 initial but here master can reach the 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:35.340
 2 but to decide a people 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:43.639
 so if I had marked the bone 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:43.639
 and those that do not but we already had 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.430
 very much 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:57.350
 because you have to choose between books 

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:59.690
 so you want to leave the comments that 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:01.640
 they would choose from some witnesses to take out 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.860
 which would burn with rewrite in the 

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.970
 which read or reread and I hope that 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.440
 they like this video do not forget 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.240
 subscribe remains if you are subscribed to 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:13.660
 he changes if you liked commenting something 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.660
 if you want obviously and I hope so 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:16.930
 bye
