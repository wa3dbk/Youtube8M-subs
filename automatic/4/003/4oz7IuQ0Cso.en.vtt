00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.470
 dear friends what's going on out there 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.850
 must start again with a hatchback 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.430
 like to plug in the comments 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.660
 Write here so that we have our style 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.460
 improve 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.189
 yes we are back as it is 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:33.740
 we can see with the title 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.740
 Flatrate Challenge back at the start 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.920
 yes, exactly as the first, I would like 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.809
 Of course, very much with you 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.480
 thanks old Swede what in the first 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.980
 and last episode has gone off it was 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.149
 the ultra madness 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.770
 I'm not so fast with that 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.450
 read afterwards as her comments 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.280
 wrote and you said that 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.899
 is really cool so we want the 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.180
 format of course also maintained and 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:58.430
 I think we will format that in then 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.270
 start fifa 16 as a series 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.370
 yes, I hope you are happy as well 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.199
 very much like me and where we have been 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.909
 on comments to so you have properly 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.470
 many suggestions always like us 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.470
 format can change or 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.360
 he brings made many suggestions as 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.040
 we can improve that again and 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.830
 what we can do differently 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.869
 and because so many great things in that 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.189
 she thought to me hey why i leave 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.259
 Do not just decide 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:29.630
 That's why I thought under 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:32.090
 We definitely do this video 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.360
 such a small raffle so to speak yes so 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.530
 play a little game you have 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.939
 now the possibility in the comments 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.920
 to write how we format this 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:41.689
 so build fairplay challenge us 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.289
 We have said for every straddle 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:47.420
 There is a rake witt and everything 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:49.670
 others are free 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.170
 selectable social it also needs a 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.640
 Reward for me that I give too 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.310
 a barefoot hair 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.929
 that means you have to do something there 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.009
 Think about how we do it best 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:59.179
 can and I thought so 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:01.819
 Maybe we'll do a little 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:06.039
 we just make it easy 

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:06.039
 so wait a minute 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:29.560
 so that the whole so a little 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.359
 it's that way for you to have incentive for you 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.280
 that the one with the best 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:34.780
 suggestion in the comments writes like 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.689
 we should build this form 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:41.500
 he gets a little something for free 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:43.480
 namely the autograph card of the 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:48.849
 of course gamble us signed by 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:50.650
 my judgment is yes you are so close again 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:51.340
 So it really pays off 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.980
 looking forward 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.079
 It is really worth it in the map too 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.530
 Write how we build the format 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:58.750
 should 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:00.790
 and I would say we go straight 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.310
 now again in a game in and 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:06.280
 look how we do it 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:09.129
 So to switch up mega fields 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.030
 colan in the gate is that mine ? 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:11.049
 Dear friends, and we have there too 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.359
 found our next opponents 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:15.040
 panathinaikos athens is our opponent 

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:17.229
 play in these and I'll watch 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.790
 I wonder if I'm maturing a bit 

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:21.190
 We can not make a skin that 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.780
 is indeed the challenge and otherwise goes 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.739
 that means we have to enter 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:29.010
 bit together a thing 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:29.010
 holder 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.640
 concrete 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.350
 hardly could 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.180
 nicely taken off 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.480
 that one with 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:56.159
 problems that no problem 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:59.219
 here it was you go it's the free kick 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:00.689
 very good where i am looking forward now 

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:04.010
 27 meters 

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:04.010
 junuzovic free kick 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:26.520
 kept nice things free on the one 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:26.520
 of 27 meters 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.720
 but today I have never seen 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.610
 Euro 

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:12.849
 really nice 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.740
 since christmas time no offside 

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:47.979
 no , you spasti her 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:12.449
 who enforced nicely please 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.220
 20 

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:29.469
 33 minutes 

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:49.980
 shoulder-beater 

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:18.970
 no and age 23 

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:19.450
 I do not even think he has boys 

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:23.530
 here 

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:25.150
 he got 21 24 I only got now 

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:27.340
 one and it has to fix 

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:28.960
 Unfortunately I have no suggestion yet 

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:31.690
 from angela that means we have to 

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:35.880
 took on the old principle make 

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:38.890
 no, you just 

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:41.940
 I played so horny I was 20 

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:41.940
 already really despair 

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:47.200
 Okay , but it harms that is 

00:07:45.790 --> 00:07:50.080
 Of course the challenge is 

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:52.060
 Of course, the challenge is clear 

00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:54.160
 I'm on your comments 

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:56.410
 save think autograph card he throws 

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.670
 on top of it all for you only 

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:59.740
 she writes the comments how should that be 

00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:01.540
 formally go ahead so that we are in 16 then 

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:02.710
 Showcase the right series and maybe 

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:05.110
 even at 15 o'clock a few follow 

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:06.700
 spends until then keep the duster 

00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:10.500
 Im good until next time 

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:10.500
 maybe it will decide new
