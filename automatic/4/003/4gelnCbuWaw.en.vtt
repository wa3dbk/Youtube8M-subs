00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.170 
dare to tell me where that television
came<00:02:27.020> from<00:02:27.230> sir<00:02:27.440> that's<00:02:28.190> beside<00:02:28.640> the<00:02:28.670> point

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
came from sir that's beside the point

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.820 
came from sir that's beside the point
do<00:02:29.420> you<00:02:29.600> understand<00:02:30.140> what<00:02:30.290> your<00:02:30.410> duty<00:02:30.710> is

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
do you understand what your duty is

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.400 
do you understand what your duty is
lieutenant<00:02:31.400> yeah<00:02:31.850> I<00:02:31.880> think<00:02:32.120> so<00:02:32.600> we<00:02:33.140> have<00:02:33.260> to<00:02:33.320> be

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
lieutenant yeah I think so we have to be

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.110 
lieutenant yeah I think so we have to be
careful<00:02:33.800> not<00:02:33.890> to<00:02:33.950> dive<00:02:34.190> too<00:02:34.400> deep<00:02:34.430> because<00:02:34.880> the

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
careful not to dive too deep because the

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.640 
careful not to dive too deep because the
deeper<00:02:35.300> we<00:02:35.510> go<00:02:35.660> the<00:02:35.690> more<00:02:35.900> pressure<00:02:36.230> the<00:02:36.470> water

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
deeper we go the more pressure the water

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:37.420 
deeper we go the more pressure the water
will<00:02:36.800> have<00:02:36.920> on<00:02:37.070> us

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
will have on us

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.610 
will have on us
if<00:02:37.490> the<00:02:38.030> pressure<00:02:38.180> gets<00:02:38.420> too<00:02:38.570> high<00:02:38.600> the<00:02:39.290> volume

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
if the pressure gets too high the volume

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.170 
if the pressure gets too high the volume
of<00:02:39.709> air<00:02:39.860> in<00:02:39.950> here<00:02:39.980> will<00:02:40.250> decrease<00:02:40.580> and<00:02:40.760> shrivel

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
of air in here will decrease and shrivel

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.270 
of air in here will decrease and shrivel
up<00:02:41.270> that<00:02:42.230> would<00:02:42.350> make<00:02:42.470> us<00:02:42.590> like<00:02:42.740> a<00:02:42.770> pale<00:02:43.040> purple

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
up that would make us like a pale purple

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.790 
up that would make us like a pale purple
raisin<00:02:43.760> on<00:02:43.820> a<00:02:43.880> hot<00:02:44.090> summer<00:02:44.360> day<00:02:44.680> speaking<00:02:45.680> of

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
raisin on a hot summer day speaking of

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.320 
raisin on a hot summer day speaking of
which<00:02:46.010> if<00:02:46.160> it<00:02:46.280> gets<00:02:46.400> too<00:02:46.550> cold<00:02:46.580> the<00:02:46.970> air<00:02:47.000> also

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
which if it gets too cold the air also

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.810 
which if it gets too cold the air also
shrink<00:02:47.780> so<00:02:48.110> that<00:02:48.230> makes<00:02:48.410> us<00:02:48.560> a<00:02:48.709> pale<00:02:49.430> purple

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:49.820 
shrink so that makes us a pale purple

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.449 
shrink so that makes us a pale purple
raisin<00:02:50.300> on<00:02:50.360> a<00:02:50.420> cold<00:02:50.780> summer

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
raisin on a cold summer

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.530 
raisin on a cold summer
it's<00:02:52.459> simple<00:02:52.760> yes<00:02:53.000> would<00:02:53.330> have<00:02:53.450> been

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
it's simple yes would have been

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.820 
it's simple yes would have been
sufficient<00:02:53.840> -<00:02:54.260> lieutenant

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
sufficient - lieutenant

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.720 
sufficient - lieutenant
so<00:02:55.790> are<00:02:56.120> you<00:02:56.420> ready<00:02:56.630> -<00:02:56.840> guys<00:02:57.020> all<00:02:57.470> right<00:02:58.340> so<00:02:58.700> I

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
so are you ready - guys all right so I

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.300 
so are you ready - guys all right so I
guess<00:02:59.090> I'll<00:02:59.300> press<00:03:00.020> this<00:03:00.230> button<00:03:00.530> here<00:03:00.680> and<00:03:01.190> we

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
guess I'll press this button here and we

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:09.300 
guess I'll press this button here and we
know

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.040 

all<00:03:10.310> of<00:03:10.370> that<00:03:10.519> video<00:03:10.670> was<00:03:11.000> correct<00:03:11.569> I<00:03:11.599> think

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
all of that video was correct I think

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:23.550 
all of that video was correct I think
the<00:03:12.170> submarine<00:03:12.650> will<00:03:12.800> expand<00:03:13.190> in

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.890 

we're<00:03:24.560> okay
