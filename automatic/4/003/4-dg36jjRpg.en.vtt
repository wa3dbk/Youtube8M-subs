00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.099 
came onto the project I think we got the
design<00:02:03.850> direction<00:02:04.060> going<00:02:04.450> fairly<00:02:04.810> quickly

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:05.109 
design direction going fairly quickly

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:06.959 
design direction going fairly quickly
but<00:02:05.439> then<00:02:06.009> we<00:02:06.130> struggled<00:02:06.459> with<00:02:06.490> the<00:02:06.639> art<00:02:06.789> style

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:06.969 
but then we struggled with the art style

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:09.600 
but then we struggled with the art style
and<00:02:07.959> because<00:02:08.410> originally<00:02:08.649> art<00:02:09.069> style<00:02:09.429> was<00:02:09.580> a

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
and because originally art style was a

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.340 
and because originally art style was a
lot<00:02:09.970> darker<00:02:10.240> and<00:02:10.539> grittier<00:02:10.600> than<00:02:11.020> what<00:02:11.230> we

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
lot darker and grittier than what we

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.920 
lot darker and grittier than what we
actually<00:02:11.500> ended<00:02:11.890> up<00:02:12.040> going<00:02:12.400> with<00:02:12.570> and<00:02:13.570> we

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
actually ended up going with and we

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.030 
actually ended up going with and we
found<00:02:14.170> that<00:02:14.350> it<00:02:14.500> would<00:02:14.590> didn't<00:02:14.830> play<00:02:15.010> very

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
found that it would didn't play very

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.440 
found that it would didn't play very
well<00:02:15.310> didn't<00:02:15.820> it<00:02:15.940> didn't<00:02:16.180> look<00:02:16.300> very<00:02:16.480> good<00:02:16.600> so

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
well didn't it didn't look very good so

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.150 
well didn't it didn't look very good so
erate<00:02:18.020> on<00:02:18.110> the<00:02:18.200> art<00:02:18.349> style<00:02:18.590> several<00:02:18.950> times

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
erate on the art style several times

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.280 
erate on the art style several times
until<00:02:19.340> we<00:02:19.550> found<00:02:19.730> one<00:02:20.030> that<00:02:20.150> we<00:02:20.270> liked<00:02:20.510> and

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
until we found one that we liked and

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.140 
until we found one that we liked and
that<00:02:21.590> was<00:02:21.860> really<00:02:22.010> just<00:02:22.310> kind<00:02:22.730> of<00:02:22.760> speaks<00:02:23.030> to

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
that was really just kind of speaks to

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.630 
that was really just kind of speaks to
the<00:02:23.330> wizard<00:02:23.930> process<00:02:24.500> of<00:02:24.680> iteration<00:02:25.220> until<00:02:25.519> we

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
the wizard process of iteration until we

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.729 
the wizard process of iteration until we
think<00:02:25.849> something<00:02:26.180> is<00:02:26.269> really<00:02:26.510> perfect<00:02:26.739> the

really<00:02:50.450> consider<00:02:50.900> to<00:02:51.080> be<00:02:51.170> a<00:02:51.200> comic<00:02:51.680> look<00:02:51.920> we

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
really consider to be a comic look we

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.070 
really consider to be a comic look we
consider<00:02:52.519> to<00:02:52.640> be<00:02:52.670> stylized<00:02:53.209> and<00:02:53.660> I<00:02:53.870> think

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
consider to be stylized and I think

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.330 
consider to be stylized and I think
there's<00:02:54.200> an<00:02:54.319> important<00:02:54.739> difference<00:02:54.830> in<00:02:55.220> that

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
there's an important difference in that

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.550 
there's an important difference in that
we<00:02:55.579> still<00:02:56.299> focus<00:02:56.690> on<00:02:56.840> very<00:02:57.049> realistic

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
we still focus on very realistic

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.050 
we still focus on very realistic
environments<00:02:58.099> from<00:02:58.160> realistic<00:02:58.610> characters

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
environments from realistic characters

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.539 
environments from realistic characters
but<00:02:59.239> we<00:02:59.390> focus<00:02:59.810> on<00:02:59.930> a<00:02:59.959> stylized<00:03:00.470> art<00:03:00.739> style<00:03:01.040> to

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
but we focus on a stylized art style to

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:03.370 
but we focus on a stylized art style to
give<00:03:01.700> the<00:03:01.790> game<00:03:01.940> longevity<00:03:02.420> and<00:03:02.810> also<00:03:03.110> to<00:03:03.200> help

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
give the game longevity and also to help

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.670 
give the game longevity and also to help
gameplay<00:03:04.280> so<00:03:04.970> we<00:03:05.329> went<00:03:05.540> through<00:03:05.900> kind<00:03:06.440> of<00:03:06.560> a

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
gameplay so we went through kind of a

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.589 
gameplay so we went through kind of a
process<00:03:06.980> where<00:03:07.400> we<00:03:07.430> did<00:03:07.760> a<00:03:07.790> darker<00:03:08.360> grittier

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:08.599 
process where we did a darker grittier

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:11.080 
process where we did a darker grittier
art<00:03:09.049> style<00:03:09.410> and<00:03:09.680> the<00:03:10.489> environments<00:03:11.000> were

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
art style and the environments were

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.940 
art style and the environments were
fairly<00:03:11.329> monotonous<00:03:11.900> and<00:03:12.200> the<00:03:12.590> creatures

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
fairly monotonous and the creatures

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.339 
fairly monotonous and the creatures
blended<00:03:13.519> like<00:03:13.880> too<00:03:14.150> well<00:03:14.390> in<00:03:14.660> a<00:03:15.019> 3d

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:15.349 
blended like too well in a 3d

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:17.500 
blended like too well in a 3d
environment<00:03:15.400> so<00:03:16.400> we<00:03:16.819> really<00:03:17.000> made<00:03:17.209> a<00:03:17.239> lot<00:03:17.480> of

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
environment so we really made a lot of

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.600 
environment so we really made a lot of
the<00:03:17.630> choices<00:03:17.870> for<00:03:18.230> the<00:03:18.290> direction<00:03:18.410> based<00:03:19.310> off

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
the choices for the direction based off

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.420 
the choices for the direction based off
of<00:03:19.640> gameplay<00:03:20.480> reasons<00:03:21.040> for<00:03:22.040> the<00:03:22.100> most<00:03:22.280> part

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
of gameplay reasons for the most part

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:23.979 
of gameplay reasons for the most part
though<00:03:22.609> the<00:03:22.819> overall<00:03:23.150> reaction<00:03:23.329> we've<00:03:23.720> gotten

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
though the overall reaction we've gotten

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:26.349 
though the overall reaction we've gotten
has<00:03:24.079> been<00:03:24.109> positive<00:03:24.709> we<00:03:25.459> have<00:03:25.579> a<00:03:25.609> minority<00:03:26.329> of

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:26.359 
has been positive we have a minority of

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:28.240 
has been positive we have a minority of
people<00:03:26.540> who<00:03:26.870> are<00:03:27.170> very<00:03:27.200> who<00:03:27.829> are<00:03:27.859> negative

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
people who are very who are negative

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.300 
people who are very who are negative
about<00:03:28.430> the<00:03:28.549> art<00:03:28.700> style<00:03:28.910> but<00:03:29.620> we<00:03:30.620> we<00:03:31.069> aren't

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
about the art style but we we aren't

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:32.830 
about the art style but we we aren't
really<00:03:31.519> surprised<00:03:32.000> by<00:03:32.329> that<00:03:32.480> reaction

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
really surprised by that reaction

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.110 
really surprised by that reaction
because<00:03:33.350> we<00:03:33.950> went<00:03:34.130> through<00:03:34.370> the<00:03:34.489> same<00:03:34.730> kind<00:03:35.060> of

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
because we went through the same kind of

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.640 
because we went through the same kind of
conceptual<00:03:35.480> struggle<00:03:35.959> that<00:03:36.049> they<00:03:36.230> did<00:03:36.470> I

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
conceptual struggle that they did I

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.979 
conceptual struggle that they did I
think<00:03:37.250> though<00:03:37.370> if<00:03:37.400> people<00:03:37.760> look<00:03:37.940> back<00:03:38.239> at<00:03:38.510> the

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
think though if people look back at the

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.559 
think though if people look back at the
original<00:03:39.500> Diablo<00:03:40.250> and<00:03:40.280> diablo<00:03:40.700> 2<00:03:40.880> diablo<00:03:41.420> 2

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569 
original Diablo and diablo 2 diablo 2

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:43.000 
original Diablo and diablo 2 diablo 2
was<00:03:41.720> panned<00:03:41.989> when<00:03:42.200> it<00:03:42.290> came<00:03:42.440> out<00:03:42.560> for<00:03:42.829> being

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
was panned when it came out for being

was panned when it came out for being

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.259 
too bright and colourful compared to the
original<00:03:44.870> diabla<00:03:45.530> so<00:03:46.130> it's<00:03:46.489> kind<00:03:46.700> of<00:03:46.760> nothing

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
original diabla so it's kind of nothing

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:48.849 
original diabla so it's kind of nothing
it's<00:03:47.480> not<00:03:47.600> something<00:03:47.930> we're<00:03:48.079> not<00:03:48.319> used<00:03:48.739> to

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:48.859 
it's not something we're not used to

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:52.059 
it's not something we're not used to
already<00:03:49.489> in<00:03:50.480> that<00:03:50.780> you<00:03:51.290> know<00:03:51.319> the<00:03:51.650> choice<00:03:51.859> was

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:52.069 
already in that you know the choice was

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:53.559 
already in that you know the choice was
made<00:03:52.220> for<00:03:52.459> gameplay<00:03:52.670> reasons<00:03:53.269> and<00:03:53.540> because

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:53.569 
made for gameplay reasons and because

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:55.629 
made for gameplay reasons and because
that<00:03:53.870> we<00:03:54.230> know<00:03:54.500> it's<00:03:54.709> the<00:03:54.889> right<00:03:55.040> choice<00:03:55.100> for

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:55.639 
that we know it's the right choice for

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:57.789 
that we know it's the right choice for
us<00:03:56.120> and<00:03:56.480> I<00:03:56.600> think<00:03:56.840> when<00:03:56.959> people<00:03:56.989> play<00:03:57.470> the<00:03:57.680> game

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 
us and I think when people play the game

00:03:57.799 --> 00:03:59.949 
us and I think when people play the game
as<00:03:57.950> a<00:03:57.980> whole<00:03:58.040> they'll<00:03:58.850> find<00:03:58.880> that<00:03:59.329> it's<00:03:59.569> very

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
as a whole they'll find that it's very

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:01.930 
as a whole they'll find that it's very
different<00:04:00.500> from<00:04:00.739> other<00:04:01.220> games<00:04:01.400> that<00:04:01.670> it's

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
different from other games that it's

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.809 
different from other games that it's
very<00:04:02.180> gothic<00:04:02.630> it's<00:04:03.049> very<00:04:03.290> dark<00:04:03.609> it's<00:04:04.609> very

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:04.819 
very gothic it's very dark it's very

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:08.589 
very gothic it's very dark it's very
mature<00:04:05.239> game<00:04:05.620> and<00:04:06.620> that<00:04:06.950> really<00:04:07.549> even<00:04:08.299> a<00:04:08.389> lot

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:08.599 
mature game and that really even a lot

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:10.030 
mature game and that really even a lot
of<00:04:08.690> the<00:04:08.750> environments<00:04:09.170> we<00:04:09.260> showed<00:04:09.470> while<00:04:09.739> I

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
of the environments we showed while I

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.620 
of the environments we showed while I
would<00:04:10.400> never<00:04:10.519> say<00:04:10.790> that<00:04:10.940> we<00:04:11.060> would<00:04:11.209> deck<00:04:11.389> away

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
would never say that we would deck away

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.620 
would never say that we would deck away
from<00:04:11.870> lighting<00:04:12.709> or<00:04:12.920> color<00:04:13.160> I<00:04:13.910> do<00:04:14.209> think<00:04:14.540> that

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
from lighting or color I do think that

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:16.839 
from lighting or color I do think that
there<00:04:14.840> probably<00:04:14.989> some<00:04:15.560> of<00:04:15.590> the<00:04:15.739> more<00:04:16.099> cheerful

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:16.849 
there probably some of the more cheerful

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:18.190 
there probably some of the more cheerful
environments<00:04:17.599> if<00:04:17.660> you<00:04:17.750> can<00:04:17.870> call<00:04:17.989> them<00:04:18.169> that

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
environments if you can call them that

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.890 
environments if you can call them that
from<00:04:19.010> that<00:04:19.250> we've<00:04:19.729> done<00:04:19.940> but<00:04:20.599> there's<00:04:20.780> been

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
from that we've done but there's been

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:22.180 
from that we've done but there's been
some<00:04:21.109> other<00:04:21.229> things<00:04:21.500> that<00:04:21.620> we've<00:04:21.829> looked<00:04:22.010> at

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
some other things that we've looked at

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.529 
some other things that we've looked at
from<00:04:22.340> the<00:04:22.520> fan<00:04:22.669> reaction<00:04:23.120> and<00:04:23.240> God<00:04:23.360> yeah

00:04:23.529 --> 00:04:23.539 
from the fan reaction and God yeah

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:24.790 
from the fan reaction and God yeah
that's<00:04:23.750> a<00:04:23.840> good<00:04:23.990> point<00:04:24.200> we<00:04:24.440> can<00:04:24.620> make<00:04:24.770> that

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
that's a good point we can make that

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:25.570 
that's a good point we can make that
better

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
better

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:26.920 
better
a couple<00:04:25.909> of<00:04:26.030> big<00:04:26.240> changes<00:04:26.419> that<00:04:26.780> we've<00:04:26.900> made

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
a couple of big changes that we've made

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.510 
a couple of big changes that we've made
one<00:04:27.259> of<00:04:27.349> them<00:04:27.470> was<00:04:27.620> that<00:04:27.830> people's<00:04:28.430> the

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.520 
one of them was that people's the

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.830 
one of them was that people's the
dungeons<00:04:28.939> were<00:04:29.090> generally<00:04:29.479> a<00:04:29.509> little<00:04:29.720> too

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
dungeons were generally a little too

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.990 
dungeons were generally a little too
clean<00:04:30.169> that<00:04:30.860> they<00:04:31.009> didn't<00:04:31.280> have<00:04:31.430> enough<00:04:31.759> kind

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
clean that they didn't have enough kind

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.570 
clean that they didn't have enough kind
of<00:04:32.090> dressing<00:04:32.900> or<00:04:33.169> gore<00:04:33.680> and<00:04:33.979> things<00:04:34.370> like<00:04:34.520> that

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
of dressing or gore and things like that

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.700 
of dressing or gore and things like that
in<00:04:34.909> them<00:04:35.060> now<00:04:35.780> the<00:04:35.840> digital<00:04:36.199> we're<00:04:36.289> showing<00:04:36.500> is

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
in them now the digital we're showing is

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.830 
in them now the digital we're showing is
not<00:04:36.860> meant<00:04:37.069> to<00:04:37.189> be<00:04:37.219> one<00:04:37.520> where<00:04:37.819> there<00:04:38.569> were<00:04:38.810> a

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
not meant to be one where there were a

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.990 
not meant to be one where there were a
lot<00:04:39.199> of<00:04:39.229> living<00:04:40.099> creatures<00:04:40.460> in<00:04:40.639> it<00:04:40.729> it<00:04:40.879> was

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
lot of living creatures in it it was

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.610 
lot of living creatures in it it was
supposed<00:04:41.180> to<00:04:41.270> be<00:04:41.360> like<00:04:41.509> an<00:04:41.629> undead<00:04:41.990> kind<00:04:42.500> of

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
supposed to be like an undead kind of

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.649 
supposed to be like an undead kind of
tomb<00:04:42.860> but<00:04:43.460> we've<00:04:43.639> gone<00:04:43.819> back<00:04:44.180> and<00:04:44.449> kind<00:04:44.539> of

00:04:44.649 --> 00:04:44.659 
tomb but we've gone back and kind of

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:46.869 
tomb but we've gone back and kind of
added<00:04:45.020> in<00:04:45.139> more<00:04:45.409> things<00:04:45.710> to<00:04:45.919> try<00:04:46.129> and<00:04:46.520> you<00:04:46.849> know

00:04:46.869 --> 00:04:46.879 
added in more things to try and you know

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:49.240 
added in more things to try and you know
get<00:04:47.180> a<00:04:47.210> little<00:04:47.629> bit<00:04:47.780> more<00:04:47.930> mccobb<00:04:48.289> feel<00:04:48.650> we

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
get a little bit more mccobb feel we

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:50.920 
get a little bit more mccobb feel we
also<00:04:49.370> had<00:04:49.520> some<00:04:49.669> people<00:04:49.969> who<00:04:50.300> said<00:04:50.539> that<00:04:50.569> the

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
also had some people who said that the

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.959 
also had some people who said that the
fact<00:04:51.169> that<00:04:51.289> at<00:04:51.530> the<00:04:51.650> end<00:04:51.770> of<00:04:51.800> a<00:04:51.889> battle<00:04:52.250> we<00:04:52.699> fade

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:52.969 
fact that at the end of a battle we fade

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:54.939 
fact that at the end of a battle we fade
out<00:04:53.120> the<00:04:53.240> corpses<00:04:53.689> we<00:04:54.169> find<00:04:54.409> primarily<00:04:54.770> do

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:54.949 
out the corpses we find primarily do

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:57.700 
out the corpses we find primarily do
that<00:04:55.099> for<00:04:55.370> performance<00:04:56.139> but<00:04:57.139> they're<00:04:57.469> right

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
that for performance but they're right

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.570 
that for performance but they're right
that<00:04:57.979> it<00:04:58.129> left<00:04:58.430> a<00:04:58.729> feeling<00:04:59.599> that<00:05:00.370> there<00:05:01.370> wasn't

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
that it left a feeling that there wasn't

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.010 
that it left a feeling that there wasn't
a<00:05:01.699> lot<00:05:01.819> of<00:05:01.879> aftermath<00:05:02.389> or<00:05:02.599> there<00:05:02.690> wasn't<00:05:02.960> it

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
a lot of aftermath or there wasn't it

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.200 
a lot of aftermath or there wasn't it
you<00:05:03.289> know<00:05:03.379> and<00:05:03.560> so<00:05:04.009> one<00:05:04.610> of<00:05:04.639> the<00:05:04.789> things<00:05:04.819> we<00:05:05.060> did

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
you know and so one of the things we did

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:06.939 
you know and so one of the things we did
was<00:05:05.240> change<00:05:05.509> how<00:05:05.750> we<00:05:05.780> fade<00:05:06.199> out<00:05:06.349> corpses<00:05:06.770> so

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:06.949 
was change how we fade out corpses so

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:09.820 
was change how we fade out corpses so
that<00:05:07.129> we<00:05:07.759> just<00:05:08.090> fade<00:05:08.449> out<00:05:08.629> after<00:05:09.379> a<00:05:09.409> certain

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830 
that we just fade out after a certain

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:11.709 
that we just fade out after a certain
number<00:05:09.979> so<00:05:10.849> at<00:05:10.969> the<00:05:11.060> end<00:05:11.090> of<00:05:11.270> every<00:05:11.479> battle

00:05:11.709 --> 00:05:11.719 
number so at the end of every battle

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:13.089 
number so at the end of every battle
there's<00:05:11.870> always<00:05:12.110> corpses<00:05:12.560> laying<00:05:12.770> around<00:05:13.009> and

00:05:13.089 --> 00:05:13.099 
there's always corpses laying around and

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:15.399 
there's always corpses laying around and
they<00:05:13.219> stay<00:05:13.460> around<00:05:13.699> forever<00:05:13.969> until<00:05:14.599> you<00:05:15.169> move

00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:15.409 
they stay around forever until you move

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:17.589 
they stay around forever until you move
