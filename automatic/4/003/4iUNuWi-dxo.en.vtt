00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:23.590 

I<00:00:12.610> use<00:00:13.610> the<00:00:13.880> trigger<00:00:14.240> here<00:00:14.720> buddy<00:00:15.260> of<00:00:15.410> the<00:00:15.590> case

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:23.600 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.980 

two<00:00:24.260> times<00:00:24.620> the<00:00:25.190> rotation<00:00:25.850> of<00:00:26.060> that<00:00:26.120> part<00:00:26.780> in

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:26.990 
two times the rotation of that part in

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.920 
two times the rotation of that part in
the<00:00:27.080> middle<00:00:27.350> that<00:00:27.640> drives<00:00:28.640> this<00:00:28.970> wheel<00:00:29.300> this

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:29.930 
the middle that drives this wheel this

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.979 
the middle that drives this wheel this
goes<00:00:30.230> to<00:00:30.260> this<00:00:30.650> and<00:00:30.950> then<00:00:31.370> it<00:00:31.880> rotates<00:00:32.119> in<00:00:32.720> that

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
goes to this and then it rotates in that

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:35.729 
goes to this and then it rotates in that
inner<00:00:33.290> gear<00:00:33.800> you<00:00:34.310> could<00:00:34.550> probably<00:00:34.910> not

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:35.739 
inner gear you could probably not

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:39.430 
inner gear you could probably not
manufacture<00:00:36.739> that<00:00:36.920> more<00:00:37.220> elegant<00:00:37.730> I<00:00:38.440> actually

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
manufacture that more elegant I actually

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.820 
manufacture that more elegant I actually
like<00:00:39.800> watches<00:00:40.309> the<00:00:40.520> kind<00:00:41.270> of<00:00:41.420> beat-up<00:00:41.830> messed

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:42.830 
like watches the kind of beat-up messed

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.130 
like watches the kind of beat-up messed
up<00:00:43.070> they<00:00:43.730> kind<00:00:43.970> of<00:00:44.000> resonate<00:00:44.480> with<00:00:44.750> where

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
up they kind of resonate with where

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.250 
up they kind of resonate with where
they've<00:00:45.290> been<00:00:45.320> and<00:00:45.530> whose<00:00:46.250> own<00:00:46.520> them<00:00:47.080> we<00:00:48.080> had

quite amazing 4matic I came across this
in<00:01:34.549> lower<00:01:34.729> Manhattan<00:01:35.509> and<00:01:35.780> I<00:01:36.619> think<00:01:37.130> it<00:01:37.250> was

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
in lower Manhattan and I think it was

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.359 
in lower Manhattan and I think it was
the<00:01:37.399> first<00:01:37.820> time<00:01:38.149> I<00:01:38.210> had<00:01:38.570> seen<00:01:38.840> it<00:01:39.109> I<00:01:39.320> had<00:01:40.039> heard

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:43.060 
the first time I had seen it I had heard
of<00:01:40.549> it<00:01:40.729> but<00:01:41.000> I<00:01:41.079> didn't<00:01:42.079> know<00:01:42.140> where<00:01:42.350> it<00:01:42.380> was<00:01:42.500> and

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
of it but I didn't know where it was and

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.779 
of it but I didn't know where it was and
I<00:01:43.820> thought<00:01:43.850> it<00:01:44.240> was<00:01:44.359> just<00:01:44.420> wonderful<00:01:45.229> I<00:01:45.789> think
