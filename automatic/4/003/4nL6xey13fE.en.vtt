so<00:02:03.030> I'm<00:02:03.090> just<00:02:03.210> going<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.390> hit<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.540> Delete<00:02:03.869> key

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
so I'm just going to hit the Delete key

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.859 
so I'm just going to hit the Delete key
and<00:02:04.259> boom<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.549> delete<00:02:06.119> it<00:02:06.149> from<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.360> Dom<00:02:06.630> over

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
and boom I delete it from the Dom over

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.570 
and boom I delete it from the Dom over
here<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.350> it<00:02:07.530> disappears<00:02:07.979> from<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.280> phone

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
here and it disappears from the phone

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.650 
here and it disappears from the phone
over<00:02:08.849> here<00:02:09.179> which<00:02:09.360> is<00:02:09.509> crazy<00:02:11.000> super<00:02:12.000> super

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
over here which is crazy super super

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.839 
over here which is crazy super super
useful

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849 
useful

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:16.030 
useful
of<00:02:14.599> course<00:02:14.870> I<00:02:14.959> can<00:02:15.079> do<00:02:15.200> things<00:02:15.409> like<00:02:15.590> change

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
of course I can do things like change

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.989 
of course I can do things like change
the<00:02:16.579> class<00:02:19.719> have<00:02:20.719> that<00:02:20.959> update<00:02:21.349> in<00:02:21.469> real<00:02:21.620> time

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:21.999 
the class have that update in real time

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:23.619 
the class have that update in real time
it's<00:02:22.999> madness

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:23.629 
it's madness

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:26.410 
it's madness
so<00:02:24.310> extremely<00:02:25.310> extremely<00:02:25.639> useful<00:02:26.180> for

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
so extremely extremely useful for

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.069 
so extremely extremely useful for
debugging<00:02:27.079> and<00:02:27.769> looking<00:02:28.549> at<00:02:28.760> the<00:02:29.030> the<00:02:29.480> Dom<00:02:29.749> on

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:30.079 
debugging and looking at the the Dom on

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:34.660 
debugging and looking at the the Dom on
the<00:02:30.469> remote<00:02:30.769> device<00:02:31.000> very<00:02:32.000> useful<00:02:33.250> maybe<00:02:34.250> even

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
the remote device very useful maybe even

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.220 
the remote device very useful maybe even
better<00:02:34.849> or<00:02:35.090> equally<00:02:35.420> cool<00:02:35.659> is<00:02:35.870> that<00:02:35.900> I<00:02:36.049> can

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
better or equally cool is that I can

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.289 
better or equally cool is that I can
look<00:02:36.319> at<00:02:36.439> the<00:02:36.500> console<00:02:37.010> so<00:02:37.760> I<00:02:37.790> can<00:02:37.939> call<00:02:38.090> up<00:02:38.209> the

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:38.299 
look at the console so I can call up the

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:40.270 
look at the console so I can call up the
JavaScript<00:02:38.780> console<00:02:39.139> now<00:02:39.620> currently<00:02:40.099> I've

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
JavaScript console now currently I've

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.349 
JavaScript console now currently I've
got<00:02:40.519> JQ<00:02:41.510> touch<00:02:41.780> in<00:02:42.019> debug<00:02:42.769> mode<00:02:42.799> in<00:02:43.359> the

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:44.359 
got JQ touch in debug mode in the

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:45.909 
got JQ touch in debug mode in the
application<00:02:44.959> here<00:02:45.139> so<00:02:45.290> if<00:02:45.409> I<00:02:45.499> tap<00:02:45.560> on

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:45.919 
application here so if I tap on

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:47.259 
application here so if I tap on
something<00:02:46.430> I'm<00:02:46.549> going<00:02:46.669> to<00:02:46.760> see<00:02:46.939> a<00:02:46.969> whole<00:02:47.150> bunch

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:47.269 
something I'm going to see a whole bunch

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:50.140 
something I'm going to see a whole bunch
of<00:02:47.419> output<00:02:47.810> to<00:02:47.840> the<00:02:48.139> console<00:02:48.620> and<00:02:49.150> normally

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
of output to the console and normally

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.369 
of output to the console and normally
that's<00:02:50.299> very<00:02:50.569> difficult<00:02:50.780> to<00:02:51.019> see<00:02:51.200> I<00:02:51.230> don't

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:51.379 
that's very difficult to see I don't

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:54.879 
that's very difficult to see I don't
maybe<00:02:51.650> I<00:02:51.709> need<00:02:51.859> to<00:02:51.949> refresh<00:02:52.189> here<00:02:52.459> hold<00:02:52.609> on<00:02:53.889> may

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:54.889 
maybe I need to refresh here hold on may

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:57.149 
maybe I need to refresh here hold on may
refresh<00:02:55.310> in<00:02:55.430> both<00:02:55.579> places

00:02:57.149 --> 00:02:57.159 
refresh in both places

00:02:57.159 --> 00:03:02.740 
refresh in both places
just<00:02:58.159> make<00:02:58.370> sure<00:03:01.299> refresh<00:03:02.299> again<00:03:02.540> over<00:03:02.719> here

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
just make sure refresh again over here

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.819 
just make sure refresh again over here
so<00:03:03.439> normally<00:03:04.299> you<00:03:05.299> can<00:03:05.540> turn<00:03:05.780> on<00:03:05.989> debugging<00:03:06.439> in

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:06.829 
so normally you can turn on debugging in

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:08.890 
so normally you can turn on debugging in
for<00:03:07.459> Safari<00:03:07.730> the<00:03:08.000> System<00:03:08.299> Preferences<00:03:08.510> but

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
for Safari the System Preferences but

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.929 
for Safari the System Preferences but
it's<00:03:09.019> very<00:03:09.169> cumbersome<00:03:09.739> and<00:03:10.040> it's<00:03:10.400> difficult

00:03:10.929 --> 00:03:10.939 
it's very cumbersome and it's difficult

00:03:10.939 --> 00:03:13.270 
it's very cumbersome and it's difficult
to<00:03:11.000> really<00:03:11.180> work<00:03:11.569> with<00:03:11.810> so<00:03:12.590> if<00:03:12.829> I<00:03:12.919> look<00:03:13.069> at<00:03:13.159> the

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
to really work with so if I look at the

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.159 
to really work with so if I look at the
console<00:03:13.639> here<00:03:13.879> now<00:03:14.120> and<00:03:14.419> actually<00:03:14.599> tap<00:03:14.959> on

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:15.169 
console here now and actually tap on

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:17.199 
console here now and actually tap on
something<00:03:15.620> I<00:03:15.799> can<00:03:16.340> see<00:03:16.609> the<00:03:16.730> console

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
something I can see the console

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.599 
something I can see the console
debugging<00:03:17.959> output<00:03:18.079> show<00:03:18.799> up<00:03:18.919> over<00:03:19.040> here<00:03:19.430> or

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:19.609 
debugging output show up over here or

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:31.979 
debugging output show up over here or
not<00:03:23.079> you<00:03:24.079> go<00:03:24.229> to<00:03:24.259> save<00:03:25.129> quit<00:03:26.409> pretty<00:03:27.409> fresh

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:39.539 

also<00:03:33.280> slide<00:03:34.280> there<00:03:34.819> we<00:03:34.939> go<00:03:36.159> sorry<00:03:37.159> about<00:03:37.280> that

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:39.549 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:42.759 

so<00:03:40.549> this<00:03:40.699> is<00:03:40.900> insanely<00:03:41.900> useful<00:03:41.930> for<00:03:42.560> debugging

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
so this is insanely useful for debugging

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:46.050 
so this is insanely useful for debugging
I<00:03:43.549> in<00:03:44.209> it<00:03:44.389> in<00:03:44.540> its<00:03:44.720> two<00:03:44.959> way<00:03:45.169> so<00:03:45.229> I<00:03:45.530> can<00:03:45.769> say

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
I in it in its two way so I can say

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:53.319 
I in it in its two way so I can say
alert<00:03:47.979> I'm<00:03:48.979> there<00:03:51.430> answer<00:03:52.430> that<00:03:52.609> it<00:03:52.849> shows<00:03:53.120> up

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:53.329 
alert I'm there answer that it shows up

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:55.270 
alert I'm there answer that it shows up
on<00:03:53.449> the<00:03:53.540> phone<00:03:53.810> I<00:03:53.840> mean<00:03:54.139> that's<00:03:54.349> just<00:03:54.470> crazy<00:03:54.829> so

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
on the phone I mean that's just crazy so

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.979 
on the phone I mean that's just crazy so
that<00:03:55.430> means<00:03:55.579> that<00:03:55.699> I<00:03:55.759> can<00:03:55.970> manipulate<00:03:56.060> I<00:03:56.689> can<00:03:56.870> I

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
that means that I can manipulate I can I

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:59.559 
that means that I can manipulate I can I
can<00:03:57.169> test<00:03:57.819> JavaScript<00:03:58.819> over<00:03:59.120> here<00:03:59.389> on<00:03:59.540> my

00:03:59.559 --> 00:03:59.569 
can test JavaScript over here on my

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:01.629 
can test JavaScript over here on my
laptop<00:03:59.930> with<00:04:00.379> my<00:04:00.530> keyboard<00:04:00.949> and<00:04:01.069> mouse<00:04:01.219> and

laptop with my keyboard and mouse and

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:03.429 
laptop with my keyboard and mouse and
have<00:04:02.180> it<00:04:02.299> actually<00:04:02.419> appear<00:04:02.930> over<00:04:03.109> here<00:04:03.290> and<00:04:03.409> I

00:04:03.429 --> 00:04:03.439 
have it actually appear over here and I

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:05.349 
have it actually appear over here and I
can<00:04:03.590> see<00:04:03.739> it<00:04:03.829> execute<00:04:04.370> in<00:04:04.489> sort<00:04:04.849> of<00:04:04.909> resource

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:05.359 
can see it execute in sort of resource

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:07.209 
can see it execute in sort of resource
constrained<00:04:06.019> real-world<00:04:06.590> environment<00:04:07.129> of

constrained real-world environment of

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:11.289 
constrained real-world environment of
the<00:04:07.310> phone<00:04:07.489> itself<00:04:07.849> very<00:04:08.780> very<00:04:09.290> useful<00:04:10.299> now

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
the phone itself very very useful now

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:12.909 
the phone itself very very useful now
this<00:04:11.599> the<00:04:11.930> timeline<00:04:12.379> I've<00:04:12.530> just<00:04:12.709> started

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:12.919 
this the timeline I've just started

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:15.729 
this the timeline I've just started
looking<00:04:13.459> at<00:04:13.819> this<00:04:14.509> seems<00:04:14.750> extremely<00:04:15.289> powerful

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
looking at this seems extremely powerful

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:17.759 
looking at this seems extremely powerful
but<00:04:15.889> I<00:04:15.949> have<00:04:16.190> to<00:04:16.340> say<00:04:16.549> that<00:04:16.729> I<00:04:16.759> don't<00:04:16.880> even

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
but I have to say that I don't even

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:21.099 
but I have to say that I don't even
completely<00:04:18.769> grok<00:04:19.159> it<00:04:19.370> yet<00:04:19.659> but<00:04:20.659> you<00:04:20.750> turn<00:04:20.930> on

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
completely grok it yet but you turn on

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:23.800 
completely grok it yet but you turn on
the<00:04:21.229> recording<00:04:21.709> here<00:04:21.979> and<00:04:22.330> then<00:04:23.330> as<00:04:23.449> you<00:04:23.539> tap

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
the recording here and then as you tap

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.520 
the recording here and then as you tap
on<00:04:24.020> things<00:04:24.320> it<00:04:24.800> gives<00:04:25.550> you<00:04:25.760> input<00:04:26.240> about<00:04:26.449> what

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:27.530 
on things it gives you input about what

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.350 
on things it gives you input about what
actually<00:04:27.980> happening<00:04:28.460> and<00:04:28.639> how<00:04:28.730> long<00:04:28.970> it<00:04:29.090> takes

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
actually happening and how long it takes

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:30.879 
actually happening and how long it takes
so<00:04:29.600> this<00:04:29.840> is<00:04:29.990> this<00:04:30.230> is<00:04:30.410> where<00:04:30.560> you<00:04:30.710> would<00:04:30.860> find

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:30.889 
so this is this is where you would find

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:33.760 
so this is this is where you would find
out<00:04:31.480> what<00:04:32.480> was<00:04:32.720> taking<00:04:33.200> a<00:04:33.290> long<00:04:33.470> time<00:04:33.710> and

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
out what was taking a long time and

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.860 
out what was taking a long time and
maybe<00:04:34.160> be<00:04:34.790> able<00:04:34.880> to<00:04:35.030> determine<00:04:35.300> why<00:04:35.630> it's

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
maybe be able to determine why it's

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:37.240 
maybe be able to determine why it's
taking<00:04:36.169> a<00:04:36.230> long<00:04:36.410> time<00:04:36.650> but<00:04:36.830> I<00:04:36.889> haven't<00:04:37.190> even

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
taking a long time but I haven't even

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.760 
taking a long time but I haven't even
dug<00:04:37.550> into<00:04:37.760> this<00:04:38.000> yet<00:04:38.270> it's<00:04:38.540> it's<00:04:39.050> pretty<00:04:39.470> new

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
dug into this yet it's it's pretty new

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.760 
dug into this yet it's it's pretty new
and<00:04:40.070> super<00:04:40.790> super<00:04:41.419> cool<00:04:41.810> looking<00:04:42.200> but<00:04:42.380> like<00:04:42.680> I

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
and super super cool looking but like I

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.970 
and super super cool looking but like I
said<00:04:42.830> I<00:04:43.040> have<00:04:43.280> to<00:04:43.400> investigate<00:04:43.880> a<00:04:43.910> little<00:04:44.180> more

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:44.980 
said I have to investigate a little more

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.740 
said I have to investigate a little more
so<00:04:45.980> hopefully<00:04:46.370> this<00:04:46.669> gets<00:04:46.910> you<00:04:47.150> excited<00:04:47.330> about

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
so hopefully this gets you excited about

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:49.390 
so hopefully this gets you excited about
Waner<00:04:48.169> I'm<00:04:48.680> going<00:04:48.860> to<00:04:48.919> do<00:04:48.980> a<00:04:49.010> couple<00:04:49.250> more

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
Waner I'm going to do a couple more

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.940 
Waner I'm going to do a couple more
videos<00:04:49.730> that<00:04:50.150> explain<00:04:51.020> how<00:04:51.169> to<00:04:51.230> install<00:04:51.710> it

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
videos that explain how to install it

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.520 
videos that explain how to install it
and<00:04:52.070> how<00:04:53.030> to<00:04:53.060> set<00:04:53.300> up<00:04:53.419> the<00:04:53.510> networking<00:04:53.930> because

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
and how to set up the networking because

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.620 
and how to set up the networking because
I<00:04:54.650> think<00:04:54.710> you'll<00:04:54.950> find<00:04:55.160> that<00:04:55.400> it's<00:04:56.300> worth

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630 
I think you'll find that it's worth

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.960 
I think you'll find that it's worth
going<00:04:57.020> through<00:04:57.290> it's<00:04:57.919> fairly<00:04:58.160> easy<00:04:58.310> setup<00:04:58.700> but

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
going through it's fairly easy setup but

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:00.970 
going through it's fairly easy setup but
it<00:04:59.000> may<00:04:59.930> be<00:04:59.960> a<00:05:00.080> little<00:05:00.200> bit<00:05:00.410> confusing<00:05:00.800> if

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:00.980 
it may be a little bit confusing if

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.390 
it may be a little bit confusing if
you're<00:05:01.100> not<00:05:01.220> super<00:05:01.460> down<00:05:01.790> with<00:05:02.000> networking

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
you're not super down with networking

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.040 
you're not super down with networking
but<00:05:04.400> I<00:05:04.430> think<00:05:04.760> you'll<00:05:04.850> find<00:05:05.030> that<00:05:05.150> it's<00:05:05.360> the

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
but I think you'll find that it's the

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.510 
but I think you'll find that it's the
amount<00:05:06.410> of<00:05:06.470> time<00:05:06.650> it<00:05:06.770> takes<00:05:06.919> to<00:05:07.010> set<00:05:07.190> up<00:05:07.310> is

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
amount of time it takes to set up is

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.650 
amount of time it takes to set up is
totally<00:05:07.910> paid<00:05:08.480> back<00:05:08.750> in<00:05:08.990> the<00:05:09.970> the<00:05:10.970> time

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:11.660 
totally paid back in the the time

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.390 
totally paid back in the the time
savings<00:05:12.050> that<00:05:12.140> you<00:05:12.260> get<00:05:12.410> from<00:05:12.620> developing

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
savings that you get from developing

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.830 
savings that you get from developing
with<00:05:13.580> it<00:05:13.760> all<00:05:14.660> right

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
with it all right

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.350 
with it all right
