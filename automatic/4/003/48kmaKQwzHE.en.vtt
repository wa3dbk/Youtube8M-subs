water infiltration let's take a look at
what<00:00:42.140> I<00:00:42.170> mean<00:00:42.410> by<00:00:42.559> then

00:00:42.939 --> 00:00:42.949 
what I mean by then

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:46.390 
what I mean by then
as<00:00:43.010> you<00:00:43.850> can<00:00:43.970> see<00:00:44.379> any<00:00:45.379> pressure<00:00:45.769> against<00:00:46.250> the

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:46.400 
as you can see any pressure against the

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.700 
as you can see any pressure against the
top<00:00:46.610> or<00:00:46.820> bottom<00:00:47.120> of<00:00:47.390> the<00:00:47.449> door<00:00:47.720> moves<00:00:48.320> the<00:00:48.530> door

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
top or bottom of the door moves the door

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.740 
top or bottom of the door moves the door
panel<00:00:49.040> away<00:00:49.160> from<00:00:49.550> the<00:00:49.670> astragal<00:00:50.150> so

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
panel away from the astragal so

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.140 
panel away from the astragal so
typically<00:00:51.110> what<00:00:51.350> you<00:00:51.470> have<00:00:51.739> is<00:00:52.010> only<00:00:52.549> one<00:00:52.940> or

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:53.150 
typically what you have is only one or

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:54.880 
typically what you have is only one or
two<00:00:53.180> points<00:00:53.659> of<00:00:53.780> locking<00:00:54.170> at<00:00:54.260> the<00:00:54.379> deadbolt

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
two points of locking at the deadbolt

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.160 
two points of locking at the deadbolt
what<00:00:55.519> Endura<00:00:55.850> has<00:00:56.150> discovered<00:00:56.720> is<00:00:56.869> that<00:00:56.900> you

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
what Endura has discovered is that you

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.079 
what Endura has discovered is that you
need<00:00:57.350> the<00:00:57.470> top<00:00:57.680> and<00:00:57.920> bottom<00:00:58.489> locking<00:00:58.790> points

00:00:59.079 --> 00:00:59.089 
need the top and bottom locking points

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:00.789 
need the top and bottom locking points
as<00:00:59.180> well<00:00:59.330> to<00:00:59.869> get<00:00:59.960> any<00:01:00.229> kind<00:01:00.559> of<00:01:00.619> performance

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:00.799

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
driven off an easy-to-use flip lever so

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.730 
driven off an easy-to-use flip lever so

as you can see the flip lever is

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.770 
as you can see the flip lever is
incorporated<00:01:47.490> into<00:01:47.670> the<00:01:47.819> astragal<00:01:48.390> itself

with<00:01:49.409> one<00:01:49.649> easy<00:01:49.920> motion<00:01:50.069> I<00:01:50.670> can<00:01:50.789> open<00:01:51.239> the<00:01:51.329> door

let's<00:03:49.680> look<00:03:49.860> on<00:03:49.950> the<00:03:50.010> full-size<00:03:50.310> astral<00:03:51.000> to

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
let's look on the full-size astral to

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.780 
let's look on the full-size astral to
see<00:03:51.239> how<00:03:51.360> that<00:03:51.540> happens<00:03:51.959> here<00:03:52.320> again<00:03:53.190> on<00:03:53.489> the

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
see how that happens here again on the

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.210 
see how that happens here again on the
astragal<00:03:54.299> I<00:03:54.540> have<00:03:55.079> my<00:03:55.260> strike<00:03:55.590> and<00:03:55.799> deadbolt

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
astragal I have my strike and deadbolt

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.670 
astragal I have my strike and deadbolt
plates<00:03:56.540> once<00:03:57.540> the<00:03:57.720> deadbolt<00:03:58.019> actuator<00:03:58.530> is

plates once the deadbolt actuator is

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.460 
plates once the deadbolt actuator is
pushed<00:03:59.030> it<00:04:00.030> rotates<00:04:00.540> the<00:04:00.660> locking<00:04:01.049> pall<00:04:01.230> at

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
pushed it rotates the locking pall at

how<00:04:29.430> easy<00:04:29.670> is<00:04:29.820> it<00:04:29.910> let<00:04:30.570> me<00:04:30.720> show<00:04:30.900> you<00:04:33.350> door

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
how easy is it let me show you door

engaging the multi-point astral you can

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.730 
engaging the multi-point astral you can
see<00:04:40.170> that<00:04:40.800> we<00:04:40.950> eliminate<00:04:41.550> that<00:04:41.730> deflection<00:04:42.180> in

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
see that we eliminate that deflection in

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.500 
see that we eliminate that deflection in
fact<00:04:43.740> endure<00:04:44.430> as<00:04:44.550> multi-point<00:04:45.000> astragal

indoor<00:04:45.870> units<00:04:46.200> have<00:04:46.350> tested<00:04:46.800> at<00:04:46.890> levels<00:04:47.250> which

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
indoor units have tested at levels which

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.310 
indoor units have tested at levels which
exceed<00:04:47.880> those<00:04:48.060> exhibited<00:04:48.630> in<00:04:48.780> units<00:04:49.140> with

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
exceed those exhibited in units with

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.170 
exceed those exhibited in units with
traditional<00:04:49.830> multi-point<00:04:50.340> locking<00:04:50.610> systems

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
traditional multi-point locking systems

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.540 
traditional multi-point locking systems
and<00:04:51.390> it's<00:04:51.870> as<00:04:52.020> easy<00:04:52.230> as<00:04:52.590> turning<00:04:52.890> the<00:04:53.220> deadbolt

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
and it's as easy as turning the deadbolt

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.360 
and it's as easy as turning the deadbolt
so<00:04:54.450> we<00:04:54.720> have<00:04:54.900> a<00:04:54.930> multi-point<00:04:55.500> locking<00:04:55.800> product

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
so we have a multi-point locking product

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.250 
so we have a multi-point locking product
which<00:04:56.520> can<00:04:56.700> be<00:04:56.820> incorporated<00:04:57.150> at<00:04:57.660> a<00:04:57.720> value

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:58.260 
which can be incorporated at a value

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.890 
which can be incorporated at a value
