all<00:00:01.290> right<00:00:01.439> to<00:00:01.650> make<00:00:01.740> these<00:00:01.920> dome<00:00:02.159> panels

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
all right to make these dome panels

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.249 
all right to make these dome panels
you're<00:00:02.790> going<00:00:02.909> to<00:00:02.970> first<00:00:03.210> start<00:00:03.600> with<00:00:03.750> one<00:00:04.230> of

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
you're going to first start with one of

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.950 
you're going to first start with one of
these<00:00:04.730> drawings<00:00:05.730> of<00:00:06.000> the<00:00:06.089> dome<00:00:06.270> panel<00:00:06.660> I<00:00:06.720> give

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
these drawings of the dome panel I give

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.480 
these drawings of the dome panel I give
you<00:00:07.639> this<00:00:08.639> entire<00:00:09.599> shape<00:00:10.380> will<00:00:10.740> replace<00:00:11.130> one

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
you this entire shape will replace one

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.499 
you this entire shape will replace one
of<00:00:11.730> those<00:00:12.120> triangles<00:00:12.990> that<00:00:13.110> you<00:00:13.590> made<00:00:13.830> your

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:14.509 
of those triangles that you made your

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:17.450 
of those triangles that you made your
coloring<00:00:15.509> models<00:00:15.900> with<00:00:16.109> then<00:00:16.949> later<00:00:17.250> we're

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
coloring models with then later we're

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.920 
coloring models with then later we're
going<00:00:17.580> to<00:00:17.699> take<00:00:17.850> each<00:00:18.090> of<00:00:18.119> these<00:00:18.539> four

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
going to take each of these four

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.580 
going to take each of these four
triangles<00:00:19.289> and<00:00:19.619> divide<00:00:19.980> them<00:00:20.340> up<00:00:21.170> so<00:00:22.170> we<00:00:22.199> have

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
triangles and divide them up so we have

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.560 
triangles and divide them up so we have
the<00:00:23.039> same<00:00:23.250> amount<00:00:23.609> of<00:00:23.670> triangles<00:00:24.150> you<00:00:24.240> had<00:00:24.420> in

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
the same amount of triangles you had in

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.140 
the same amount of triangles you had in
each<00:00:24.689> of<00:00:24.900> those<00:00:25.019> panels<00:00:25.350> in<00:00:25.710> your<00:00:26.150> coloring

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
each of those panels in your coloring

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.089 
each of those panels in your coloring
pattern<00:00:27.570> so<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.590> first<00:00:28.800> thing<00:00:29.070> is<00:00:31.040> take<00:00:32.040> a

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
pattern so the first thing is take a

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.540 
pattern so the first thing is take a
pair<00:00:32.399> of<00:00:32.430> scissors<00:00:32.910> and<00:00:33.120> just<00:00:33.180> cut<00:00:33.780> this<00:00:34.260> out

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
pair of scissors and just cut this out

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.130 
pair of scissors and just cut this out
leaving<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.910> little<00:00:36.090> bit<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.390> space<00:00:36.570> around<00:00:36.630> the

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
leaving a little bit of space around the

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.200 
leaving a little bit of space around the
edges<00:00:37.500> so<00:00:38.010> I<00:00:38.040> take<00:00:38.850> my<00:00:39.030> scissors<00:00:39.270> cut<00:00:40.230> it<00:00:40.350> out

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
edges so I take my scissors cut it out

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.130 
edges so I take my scissors cut it out
leaving<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.239> little<00:00:42.390> bit<00:00:42.510> of<00:00:42.600> space<00:00:42.899> around

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
leaving a little bit of space around

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.400 
leaving a little bit of space around
each<00:00:43.469> edge<00:00:44.660> so<00:00:45.660> now<00:00:45.780> take<00:00:46.110> that<00:00:46.140> piece<00:00:48.289> put<00:00:49.289> it

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
each edge so now take that piece put it

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.080 
each edge so now take that piece put it
on<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.649> piece<00:00:50.640> of<00:00:50.879> file<00:00:51.120> folder<00:00:51.600> material<00:00:52.170> and

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
on a piece of file folder material and

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.880 
on a piece of file folder material and
tape<00:00:54.090> it<00:00:54.120> down<00:00:54.480> so<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.809> doesn't<00:00:54.840> move<00:00:55.170> so<00:00:55.860> just

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
tape it down so it doesn't move so just

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.849 
tape it down so it doesn't move so just
put<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.190> little<00:00:56.309> piece<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.610> tape<00:00:56.789> on<00:00:57.649> each<00:00:58.649> of

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
put a little piece of tape on each of

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:09.320 
put a little piece of tape on each of
the<00:00:58.980> three<00:00:59.129> sides<00:01:07.159> like<00:01:08.159> that<00:01:08.460> so<00:01:08.909> now<00:01:09.060> it's<00:01:09.210> on

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
the three sides like that so now it's on

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.600 
the three sides like that so now it's on
that<00:01:09.600> piece<00:01:10.229> of<00:01:10.260> paper<00:01:10.500> that's<00:01:11.010> on<00:01:11.159> that<00:01:11.340> file

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
that piece of paper that's on that file

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.230 
that piece of paper that's on that file
folder<00:01:12.320> and<00:01:13.320> now<00:01:13.470> take<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.890> compass<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.729> straight

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
folder and now take a compass a straight

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.440 
folder and now take a compass a straight
pin<00:01:15.509> anything<00:01:16.549> that<00:01:17.549> comes<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.880> a<00:01:17.939> point<00:01:18.000> and

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
pin anything that comes to a point and

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.160 
pin anything that comes to a point and
at<00:01:19.880> every<00:01:20.880> one<00:01:21.180> of<00:01:21.240> these<00:01:21.420> spots<00:01:21.810> where<00:01:22.080> the

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
at every one of these spots where the

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.950 
at every one of these spots where the
lines<00:01:22.380> intersect<00:01:22.560> there's<00:01:23.250> one<00:01:23.520> two<00:01:24.060> three

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
lines intersect there's one two three

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.289 
lines intersect there's one two three
four<00:01:25.409> five<00:01:26.189> six<00:01:27.030> of<00:01:27.299> them<00:01:27.500> poke<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.909> very<00:01:29.909> small

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
four five six of them poke a very small

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.840 
four five six of them poke a very small
hole<00:01:30.570> at<00:01:30.869> exactly<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:32.280> point<00:01:32.549> where<00:01:32.729> they

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
hole at exactly the point where they

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.510 
hole at exactly the point where they
intersect<00:01:33.049> so<00:01:34.049> just<00:01:34.290> poke<00:01:34.530> through<00:01:34.829> so<00:01:35.250> enough

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
intersect so just poke through so enough

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.399 
intersect so just poke through so enough
so<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:35.790> goes<00:01:35.970> through<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.420> paper<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:37.140> through

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
so it goes through the paper and through

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.640 
so it goes through the paper and through
the<00:01:37.560> file<00:01:37.799> folder<00:01:38.100> material<00:01:38.790> so<00:01:39.600> poke<00:01:39.869> all<00:01:40.200> six

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
the file folder material so poke all six

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.770 
the file folder material so poke all six
of<00:01:40.799> those<00:01:40.979> holes<00:01:41.369> being<00:01:41.700> as<00:01:41.939> accurate<00:01:42.299> as<00:01:42.750> you

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
of those holes being as accurate as you

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:50.600 
of those holes being as accurate as you
can<00:01:48.079> all<00:01:49.079> right<00:01:49.140> once<00:01:49.740> you've<00:01:49.890> got<00:01:50.070> that<00:01:50.280> done

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
can all right once you've got that done

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.620 
can all right once you've got that done
go<00:01:51.420> ahead<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:52.399> remove<00:01:53.399> this<00:01:53.939> piece<00:01:54.299> of<00:01:54.479> paper

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
go ahead and remove this piece of paper

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:01.740 
go ahead and remove this piece of paper
from<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.860> file<00:01:56.159> folder<00:01:56.430> material

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.770 

all<00:02:01.960> right<00:02:02.140> now<00:02:02.380> I<00:02:02.410> removed<00:02:03.660> that<00:02:04.660> pattern<00:02:05.230> and

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
all right now I removed that pattern and

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.469 
all right now I removed that pattern and
I<00:02:07.780> have<00:02:08.490> so<00:02:09.490> you<00:02:09.580> can<00:02:09.759> see<00:02:09.910> it<00:02:10.030> I've<00:02:10.149> circled

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
I have so you can see it I've circled

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.620 
I have so you can see it I've circled
each<00:02:10.840> of<00:02:11.050> the<00:02:11.200> little<00:02:11.620> six<00:02:12.130> little<00:02:12.430> holes<00:02:13.270> that

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
each of the little six little holes that

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.990 
each of the little six little holes that
the<00:02:13.840> compass<00:02:14.320> point<00:02:14.560> created<00:02:15.100> so<00:02:15.760> now<00:02:15.880> I'm

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
the compass point created so now I'm

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.300 
the compass point created so now I'm
going<00:02:16.180> to<00:02:16.270> connect<00:02:16.660> all<00:02:16.870> of<00:02:16.900> those<00:02:17.170> to<00:02:17.530> build

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
going to connect all of those to build

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.550 
going to connect all of those to build
that<00:02:18.520> pattern<00:02:18.970> back<00:02:19.180> up<00:02:19.450> so<00:02:20.140> you<00:02:20.170> want<00:02:20.320> to<00:02:20.440> be

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
that pattern back up so you want to be

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.700 
that pattern back up so you want to be
as<00:02:20.830> accurate<00:02:21.190> as<00:02:21.580> you<00:02:21.760> can<00:02:22.000> here<00:02:22.530> with<00:02:23.530> these

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
as accurate as you can here with these

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.520 
as accurate as you can here with these
dome<00:02:23.980> panels<00:02:24.460> every<00:02:25.360> little<00:02:25.600> mistake<00:02:25.720> you

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
dome panels every little mistake you

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:27.660 
dome panels every little mistake you
make<00:02:26.740> when<00:02:27.010> you<00:02:27.100> start<00:02:27.310> putting<00:02:27.490> them

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
make when you start putting them

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.910 
make when you start putting them
together<00:02:27.790> they<00:02:28.390> add<00:02:28.570> up<00:02:28.840> and<00:02:29.080> it<00:02:29.410> could<00:02:29.620> be<00:02:29.770> way

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
together they add up and it could be way

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.150 
together they add up and it could be way
off<00:02:30.090> so<00:02:31.090> I'm<00:02:31.510> gonna<00:02:31.720> the<00:02:32.440> best<00:02:32.620> way<00:02:32.770> to<00:02:32.800> do<00:02:33.010> this

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
off so I'm gonna the best way to do this

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.060 
off so I'm gonna the best way to do this
is<00:02:33.340> put<00:02:33.580> your<00:02:33.730> pencil<00:02:34.330> or<00:02:34.480> pen<00:02:34.750> point<00:02:35.050> in<00:02:35.410> one

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
is put your pencil or pen point in one

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.610 
is put your pencil or pen point in one
of<00:02:36.190> those<00:02:36.280> little<00:02:36.480> holes<00:02:37.480> you<00:02:37.690> made<00:02:37.840> slide

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
of those little holes you made slide

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.310 
of those little holes you made slide
straightedge<00:02:39.220> up<00:02:39.490> against<00:02:39.970> it<00:02:40.290> rotate<00:02:41.290> it

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
straightedge up against it rotate it

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.910 
straightedge up against it rotate it
around<00:02:41.560> so<00:02:41.980> it<00:02:42.100> meets<00:02:42.340> up<00:02:42.580> with<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:44.680> other

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
around so it meets up with the other

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.890 
around so it meets up with the other
point<00:02:45.280> if<00:02:45.910> you<00:02:46.090> want<00:02:46.240> to<00:02:46.300> put<00:02:46.450> your<00:02:46.540> pen<00:02:46.750> in

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
point if you want to put your pen in

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.880 
point if you want to put your pen in
that<00:02:47.050> make<00:02:47.410> sure<00:02:47.560> that<00:02:47.770> the<00:02:48.510> lines<00:02:49.510> up<00:02:49.890> perfect

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
that make sure that the lines up perfect

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.350 
that make sure that the lines up perfect
then<00:02:51.340> drawing<00:02:51.820> the<00:02:52.030> line<00:02:53.940> so<00:02:54.940> there's<00:02:55.180> that

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
then drawing the line so there's that

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.560 
then drawing the line so there's that
line<00:02:55.660> and<00:02:55.990> I<00:02:56.080> want<00:02:56.290> to<00:02:56.350> do<00:02:56.440> that<00:02:56.620> for<00:02:57.120> all<00:02:58.120> of

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
line and I want to do that for all of

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:10.420 
line and I want to do that for all of
those<00:02:58.720> lines<00:02:59.110> that<00:02:59.590> build<00:03:00.430> this<00:03:00.610> up

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.460 

all<00:03:11.430> right<00:03:11.640> now<00:03:11.870> once<00:03:12.870> you've<00:03:13.020> got<00:03:13.200> all<00:03:13.230> your

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
all right now once you've got all your

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.050 
all right now once you've got all your
lines<00:03:13.739> drawn<00:03:14.099> in<00:03:14.340> you<00:03:14.580> can<00:03:14.730> take<00:03:14.880> your

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
lines drawn in you can take your

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.290 
lines drawn in you can take your
scissors<00:03:15.450> once<00:03:15.870> again<00:03:16.310> cut<00:03:17.310> this<00:03:17.520> out<00:03:17.790> leaving

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
scissors once again cut this out leaving

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.400 
scissors once again cut this out leaving
just<00:03:19.069> a<00:03:20.069> little<00:03:20.340> bit<00:03:20.489> around<00:03:20.910> each<00:03:21.180> edge<00:03:21.420> so

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
just a little bit around each edge so

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.110 
just a little bit around each edge so
now<00:03:22.530> you've<00:03:22.709> got<00:03:22.739> a<00:03:23.610> more<00:03:24.300> sturdy<00:03:24.810> copy<00:03:25.410> of<00:03:25.800> the

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
now you've got a more sturdy copy of the

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.530 
now you've got a more sturdy copy of the
panel<00:03:27.120> you<00:03:27.330> could<00:03:28.020> I<00:03:28.050> suppose<00:03:28.380> if<00:03:28.709> you<00:03:28.830> wanted

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
panel you could I suppose if you wanted

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.050 
panel you could I suppose if you wanted
use<00:03:30.540> the<00:03:30.780> original<00:03:31.110> thin<00:03:31.950> paper<00:03:32.280> one<00:03:32.640> but<00:03:32.910> it's

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
use the original thin paper one but it's

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.229 
use the original thin paper one but it's
going<00:03:33.150> to<00:03:33.209> get<00:03:33.420> ripped<00:03:34.200> and<00:03:34.500> torn<00:03:34.770> so<00:03:35.160> this<00:03:36.000> way

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
going to get ripped and torn so this way

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.240 
going to get ripped and torn so this way
it<00:03:36.660> will<00:03:36.750> stay<00:03:36.870> better<00:03:37.230> and<00:03:37.500> you<00:03:37.620> can<00:03:37.800> be<00:03:38.069> more

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
it will stay better and you can be more

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.850 
it will stay better and you can be more
accurate<00:03:38.730> so<00:03:39.480> now<00:03:40.380> that<00:03:40.440> you've<00:03:40.680> got<00:03:40.830> that

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
accurate so now that you've got that

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.559 
accurate so now that you've got that
made<00:03:41.450> you<00:03:42.450> can<00:03:42.660> use<00:03:42.900> it<00:03:43.910> take<00:03:44.910> more<00:03:45.269> file

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
made you can use it take more file

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:49.330 
made you can use it take more file
folder<00:03:46.050> material<00:03:46.590> put<00:03:47.010> it<00:03:47.160> on<00:03:47.310> here<00:03:47.850> use<00:03:48.690> your

folder material put it on here use your

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.620 
folder material put it on here use your
point<00:03:50.340> to<00:03:51.030> mark<00:03:51.959> your<00:03:52.290> six<00:03:52.769> points<00:03:53.569> draw<00:03:54.569> the

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
point to mark your six points draw the

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.509 
point to mark your six points draw the
panels<00:03:55.200> out<00:03:55.440> and<00:03:55.970> then<00:03:56.970> cut<00:03:57.330> them<00:03:57.390> out<00:03:57.569> as

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
panels out and then cut them out as

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:02.330 
panels out and then cut them out as
accurately<00:03:59.519> as<00:03:59.700> possible<00:04:00.769> so<00:04:01.769> that<00:04:01.980> you<00:04:02.130> end

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
accurately as possible so that you end

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
accurately as possible so that you end
up<00:04:02.610> with<00:04:03.500> 20<00:04:04.500> panels<00:04:05.040> that<00:04:05.370> look<00:04:05.519> like<00:04:05.700> that<00:04:05.970> so

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
up with 20 panels that look like that so

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.180 
up with 20 panels that look like that so
you<00:04:06.450> got<00:04:06.720> your<00:04:06.840> 20<00:04:07.230> different<00:04:07.380> panels<00:04:07.950> with

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
you got your 20 different panels with

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:16.190 
you got your 20 different panels with
the<00:04:08.519> four<00:04:09.239> triangles<00:04:14.600> all<00:04:15.600> right<00:04:15.750> once<00:04:16.019> you've

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
the four triangles all right once you've

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.380 
the four triangles all right once you've
got<00:04:16.440> 20<00:04:17.220> of<00:04:17.340> these<00:04:17.459> you<00:04:17.820> need<00:04:17.970> to<00:04:18.060> make<00:04:18.269> the

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
got 20 of these you need to make the

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.479 
got 20 of these you need to make the
marks<00:04:18.750> for<00:04:19.019> all<00:04:19.350> the<00:04:19.560> other<00:04:19.769> triangles<00:04:20.370> we're

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
marks for all the other triangles we're

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.099 
marks for all the other triangles we're
going<00:04:20.609> to<00:04:20.669> take<00:04:20.789> each<00:04:21.000> of<00:04:21.209> these<00:04:21.419> four

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
going to take each of these four

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:24.110 
going to take each of these four
triangles<00:04:22.470> and<00:04:22.860> divide<00:04:23.130> them<00:04:23.370> up<00:04:23.400> into<00:04:23.729> four

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
triangles and divide them up into four

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.240 
triangles and divide them up into four
smaller<00:04:24.539> triangles<00:04:25.169> so<00:04:25.830> that<00:04:25.979> by<00:04:26.100> the<00:04:26.130> time

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.250 
smaller triangles so that by the time

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:28.250 
smaller triangles so that by the time
you<00:04:26.550> get<00:04:26.669> done<00:04:26.880> this<00:04:27.120> has<00:04:27.330> as<00:04:27.479> many<00:04:27.630> triangles

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
you get done this has as many triangles

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.420 
you get done this has as many triangles
as<00:04:28.380> you<00:04:28.470> had<00:04:28.680> on<00:04:28.830> each<00:04:28.950> of<00:04:29.100> your<00:04:29.190> color

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
as you had on each of your color

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.659 
as you had on each of your color
colouring<00:04:30.150> patterns<00:04:30.830> so<00:04:31.830> you<00:04:31.919> need<00:04:32.250> to<00:04:32.400> look

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 
colouring patterns so you need to look

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:34.850 
colouring patterns so you need to look
at<00:04:32.910> the<00:04:33.090> two<00:04:33.270> different<00:04:33.300> lengths<00:04:33.900> here<00:04:34.140> these

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
at the two different lengths here these

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.529 
at the two different lengths here these
three<00:04:35.220> lines<00:04:35.430> in<00:04:35.640> the<00:04:35.700> center<00:04:35.970> are<00:04:36.240> all<00:04:36.360> the

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:36.539 
three lines in the center are all the

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:38.719 
three lines in the center are all the
same<00:04:36.750> length<00:04:36.990> and<00:04:37.289> then<00:04:37.470> these<00:04:37.680> three<00:04:38.070> it's

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:38.729 
same length and then these three it's

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:41.300 
same length and then these three it's
going<00:04:38.940> to<00:04:39.030> be<00:04:39.090> these<00:04:39.210> six<00:04:40.039> segments<00:04:41.039> around

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
going to be these six segments around

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.240 
going to be these six segments around
the<00:04:41.430> outside<00:04:41.970> that<00:04:42.900> make<00:04:43.110> up<00:04:43.320> this<00:04:43.530> triangle

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
the outside that make up this triangle

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.020 
the outside that make up this triangle
are<00:04:44.550> all<00:04:44.789> the<00:04:44.940> same<00:04:45.180> length<00:04:45.419> so<00:04:46.460> measure<00:04:47.460> this

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
are all the same length so measure this

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.810 
are all the same length so measure this
length<00:04:48.229> find<00:04:49.229> half<00:04:49.530> of<00:04:49.770> it<00:04:49.950> and<00:04:50.100> then<00:04:50.580> you<00:04:50.700> can

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:50.820 
length find half of it and then you can

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:52.610 
length find half of it and then you can
find<00:04:51.030> its<00:04:51.210> midpoint<00:04:51.419> same<00:04:52.080> thing<00:04:52.350> with<00:04:52.470> this

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
find its midpoint same thing with this

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.090 
find its midpoint same thing with this
line<00:04:52.910> so<00:04:53.910> I've<00:04:54.840> just<00:04:54.900> marked<00:04:55.500> those<00:04:55.650> lengths

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
line so I've just marked those lengths

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.930 
line so I've just marked those lengths
off<00:04:56.280> on<00:04:56.550> another<00:04:56.970> little<00:04:57.720> scrap<00:04:58.080> of<00:04:58.940> file

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
off on another little scrap of file

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.050 
off on another little scrap of file
material<00:05:00.570> so<00:05:00.960> I'm<00:05:01.770> gonna<00:05:01.979> take<00:05:02.550> this<00:05:02.760> length

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
material so I'm gonna take this length

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.180 
material so I'm gonna take this length
for<00:05:03.360> the<00:05:03.419> center<00:05:04.669> line<00:05:05.669> it<00:05:05.850> up<00:05:05.940> and<00:05:06.150> just<00:05:06.210> mark

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
for the center line it up and just mark

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.860 
for the center line it up and just mark
that<00:05:08.190> center<00:05:08.639> point<00:05:08.850> now<00:05:09.150> this<00:05:09.419> doesn't<00:05:09.660> have

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
that center point now this doesn't have

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.870 
that center point now this doesn't have
to<00:05:09.990> be<00:05:10.110> super<00:05:10.620> accurate<00:05:11.039> but<00:05:11.490> you<00:05:11.520> want<00:05:11.729> to<00:05:11.789> be

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
to be super accurate but you want to be

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.219 
to be super accurate but you want to be
as<00:05:11.970> accurate<00:05:12.360> as<00:05:12.450> you<00:05:12.479> can<00:05:12.840> so<00:05:13.530> gonna<00:05:13.680> mark<00:05:14.010> all

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:15.229 
as accurate as you can so gonna mark all

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:20.000 
as accurate as you can so gonna mark all
three<00:05:16.229> of<00:05:16.350> those<00:05:16.530> and<00:05:17.360> then<00:05:18.590> once<00:05:19.590> I<00:05:19.680> get<00:05:19.830> those

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.010 
three of those and then once I get those

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:21.350 
three of those and then once I get those
all<00:05:20.250> done<00:05:20.550> I'm<00:05:20.729> going<00:05:20.820> to<00:05:20.880> go<00:05:20.940> around<00:05:21.240> the

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
all done I'm going to go around the

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.710 
all done I'm going to go around the
outside<00:05:21.840> edges

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
outside edges

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.330 
outside edges
those<00:05:22.990> marked<00:05:23.350> on<00:05:23.500> this<00:05:23.650> other<00:05:23.830> side<00:05:23.920> I've

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:24.340 
those marked on this other side I've

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.090 
those marked on this other side I've
measured<00:05:24.550> it<00:05:24.790> divided<00:05:25.330> it<00:05:25.420> by<00:05:25.570> two<00:05:25.630> so<00:05:26.100> I'm

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.100 
measured it divided it by two so I'm

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.080 
measured it divided it by two so I'm
going<00:05:27.220> to<00:05:27.250> go<00:05:27.340> around<00:05:27.580> the<00:05:27.700> outside<00:05:27.880> here<00:05:28.600> and

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.090 
going to go around the outside here and

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:34.140 
going to go around the outside here and
just<00:05:31.090> mark<00:05:31.360> those<00:05:32.400> so<00:05:33.400> that<00:05:33.430> when<00:05:33.670> I<00:05:33.700> get<00:05:33.910> done

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
just mark those so that when I get done

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.540 
just mark those so that when I get done
I've<00:05:34.330> got<00:05:34.360> all<00:05:34.750> of<00:05:34.780> the<00:05:35.170> segments<00:05:36.010> marked<00:05:36.370> for

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
I've got all of the segments marked for

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.060 
I've got all of the segments marked for
their<00:05:36.760> midpoints<00:05:37.680> okay<00:05:38.680> and<00:05:38.770> once<00:05:38.890> I've<00:05:39.040> got

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.070 
their midpoints okay and once I've got

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:40.980 
their midpoints okay and once I've got
that<00:05:39.280> done<00:05:39.670> I'm<00:05:39.940> gonna<00:05:40.090> connect<00:05:40.480> all<00:05:40.690> of<00:05:40.720> those

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
that done I'm gonna connect all of those

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.860 
that done I'm gonna connect all of those
using<00:05:41.470> my<00:05:41.590> straightedge<00:05:42.270> once<00:05:43.270> again<00:05:43.630> this

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870 
using my straightedge once again this

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.850 
using my straightedge once again this
doesn't<00:05:44.110> have<00:05:44.260> to<00:05:44.320> be<00:05:44.440> super<00:05:44.620> accurate<00:05:44.980> but

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
doesn't have to be super accurate but

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.900 
doesn't have to be super accurate but
you<00:05:47.860> gonna<00:05:48.010> try<00:05:48.190> to<00:05:48.250> be<00:05:48.400> as<00:05:48.520> accurate<00:05:48.730> as

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:48.910 
you gonna try to be as accurate as

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:52.500 
you gonna try to be as accurate as
possible<00:05:49.830> so<00:05:50.830> go<00:05:51.040> ahead<00:05:51.280> and<00:05:51.430> draw<00:05:51.610> in<00:05:51.940> all<00:05:52.300> of

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:52.510 
possible so go ahead and draw in all of

00:05:52.510 --> 00:06:02.760 
possible so go ahead and draw in all of
those<00:05:53.790> lines<00:06:00.270> all<00:06:01.270> right<00:06:01.480> once<00:06:02.410> you've<00:06:02.590> got

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:02.770 
those lines all right once you've got

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:07.770 
those lines all right once you've got
those<00:06:03.040> done<00:06:03.250> for<00:06:03.640> 20<00:06:04.590> then<00:06:06.180> you've<00:06:07.180> got<00:06:07.420> enough

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:07.780 
those done for 20 then you've got enough

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.630 
those done for 20 then you've got enough
of<00:06:07.960> these<00:06:08.080> to<00:06:08.140> do<00:06:08.920> what<00:06:09.130> you<00:06:09.250> did<00:06:09.400> on<00:06:09.520> your

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:09.640 
of these to do what you did on your

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.610 
of these to do what you did on your
coloring<00:06:10.030> pattern<00:06:10.360> so<00:06:10.690> each<00:06:11.140> of<00:06:11.200> these<00:06:11.560> is

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:11.620 
coloring pattern so each of these is

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.530 
coloring pattern so each of these is
going<00:06:12.040> to<00:06:12.130> replace<00:06:12.430> one<00:06:12.790> of<00:06:12.820> these<00:06:13.030> things<00:06:13.360> you

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:13.540 
going to replace one of these things you

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:15.930 
going to replace one of these things you
used<00:06:13.780> on<00:06:14.020> your<00:06:14.230> coloring<00:06:14.680> pattern<00:06:15.070> that<00:06:15.669> you

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:15.940 
used on your coloring pattern that you

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:20.100 
used on your coloring pattern that you
were<00:06:16.090> then<00:06:16.390> going<00:06:16.720> to<00:06:16.840> match<00:06:17.260> up<00:06:17.620> with<00:06:18.900> one<00:06:19.900> of

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:20.110 
were then going to match up with one of

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:23.430 
were then going to match up with one of
the<00:06:20.440> panels<00:06:21.310> you<00:06:21.460> had<00:06:21.700> when<00:06:22.390> you<00:06:22.419> did<00:06:23.320> the

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:23.440 
the panels you had when you did the

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:28.950 
the panels you had when you did the
coloring<00:06:23.770> pattern<00:06:25.710> so<00:06:26.710> you've<00:06:26.860> only<00:06:26.980> got<00:06:27.960> one

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:28.960 
coloring pattern so you've only got one

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.890 
coloring pattern so you've only got one
more<00:06:29.169> thing<00:06:29.200> that<00:06:29.860> you<00:06:30.220> have<00:06:30.460> to<00:06:30.640> do<00:06:30.820> and<00:06:31.120> that

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:31.900 
more thing that you have to do and that

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:35.159 
more thing that you have to do and that
is<00:06:32.430> these<00:06:33.430> can't<00:06:33.820> be<00:06:33.880> flat<00:06:34.300> because<00:06:34.780> the<00:06:34.900> domes

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:35.169 
is these can't be flat because the domes

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:37.290 
is these can't be flat because the domes
been<00:06:35.620> so<00:06:36.100> they're<00:06:36.460> actually<00:06:36.669> going<00:06:36.970> to<00:06:37.240> be

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:37.300 
been so they're actually going to be

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.740 
been so they're actually going to be
bent<00:06:38.140> a<00:06:38.350> little<00:06:38.800> bit<00:06:39.010> along<00:06:39.940> these<00:06:40.270> three

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:40.750 
bent a little bit along these three

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:45.270 
bent a little bit along these three
lines<00:06:41.400> that<00:06:42.400> are<00:06:42.610> in<00:06:42.760> the<00:06:42.880> center<00:06:43.650> so<00:06:44.650> you<00:06:45.070> need

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:45.280 
lines that are in the center so you need

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.890 
lines that are in the center so you need
to<00:06:45.460> use<00:06:45.880> a<00:06:45.910> straightedge<00:06:47.430> one<00:06:48.430> of<00:06:48.580> the

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:48.900 
to use a straightedge one of the

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.270 
to use a straightedge one of the
protractors<00:06:49.900> or<00:06:50.110> the<00:06:50.290> hard<00:06:50.500> plastic<00:06:50.710> straight

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:51.280 
protractors or the hard plastic straight

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:56.190 
protractors or the hard plastic straight
edges<00:06:51.700> and<00:06:53.130> Bend<00:06:54.130> each<00:06:54.340> of<00:06:54.520> those<00:06:54.840> so<00:06:55.840> the<00:06:56.050> best

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:56.200 
edges and Bend each of those so the best

00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:00.150 
edges and Bend each of those so the best
way<00:06:56.380> to<00:06:56.410> do<00:06:56.650> that<00:06:56.830> is<00:06:57.990> take<00:06:58.990> a<00:06:59.160> protractor

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:00.160 
way to do that is take a protractor

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.130 
way to do that is take a protractor
straight<00:07:00.940> edge<00:07:01.090> line<00:07:01.419> it<00:07:01.600> up<00:07:01.690> with<00:07:01.900> one<00:07:02.110> of

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:02.140 
straight edge line it up with one of

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:13.170 
straight edge line it up with one of
these<00:07:02.320> lines<00:07:06.090> and<00:07:07.530> just<00:07:08.530> very<00:07:08.800> gently<00:07:12.180> fan

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:13.180 
these lines and just very gently fan

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:16.710 
these lines and just very gently fan
this<00:07:13.630> up<00:07:13.900> just<00:07:14.110> a<00:07:14.380> little<00:07:14.410> bit<00:07:15.419> you<00:07:16.419> don't<00:07:16.570> want

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:16.720 
this up just a little bit you don't want

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:20.159 
this up just a little bit you don't want
it<00:07:17.020> to<00:07:17.140> be<00:07:17.500> bent<00:07:17.830> a<00:07:17.979> lot<00:07:18.390> just<00:07:19.390> a<00:07:19.570> slight<00:07:19.870> angle

00:07:20.159 --> 00:07:20.169 
it to be bent a lot just a slight angle

00:07:20.169 --> 00:07:22.980 
it to be bent a lot just a slight angle
like<00:07:20.470> that<00:07:20.680> as<00:07:20.830> all<00:07:20.979> it<00:07:21.130> takes<00:07:21.630> you<00:07:22.630> don't<00:07:22.810> want

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:22.990 
like that as all it takes you don't want

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:24.810 
like that as all it takes you don't want
it<00:07:23.080> to<00:07:23.140> defend<00:07:23.380> a<00:07:23.500> lot<00:07:23.530> because<00:07:24.010> you<00:07:24.130> bend<00:07:24.669> it<00:07:24.760> a

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:24.820 
it to defend a lot because you bend it a

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:26.190 
it to defend a lot because you bend it a
lot<00:07:25.000> then<00:07:25.210> the<00:07:25.240> whole<00:07:25.450> thing<00:07:25.660> will<00:07:25.780> just<00:07:26.020> want

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:26.200 
lot then the whole thing will just want

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:30.930 
lot then the whole thing will just want
to<00:07:26.320> collapse<00:07:26.590> in<00:07:26.860> on<00:07:26.979> itself<00:07:29.130> so<00:07:30.130> line<00:07:30.700> those

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:30.940 
to collapse in on itself so line those

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:34.410 
to collapse in on itself so line those
up<00:07:30.970> bend<00:07:31.720> it<00:07:31.870> up<00:07:31.990> just<00:07:32.169> a<00:07:32.320> little<00:07:32.349> bit<00:07:32.590> now

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:34.420 
up bend it up just a little bit now

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:36.000 
up bend it up just a little bit now
I've<00:07:34.540> got<00:07:34.720> the<00:07:34.840> lines<00:07:35.050> in<00:07:35.290> this<00:07:35.410> side<00:07:35.650> so<00:07:35.830> this

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:36.010 
I've got the lines in this side so this

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:38.880 
I've got the lines in this side so this
is<00:07:36.190> where<00:07:36.610> I'm<00:07:36.700> going<00:07:36.850> to<00:07:36.910> color<00:07:37.090> it<00:07:37.330> so<00:07:37.890> you

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:38.890 
is where I'm going to color it so you

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:40.770 
is where I'm going to color it so you
don't<00:07:39.100> want<00:07:39.310> them<00:07:39.760> to<00:07:39.940> be<00:07:40.090> bent<00:07:40.360> this<00:07:40.450> way

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:40.780 
don't want them to be bent this way

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:42.270 
don't want them to be bent this way
because<00:07:40.930> that<00:07:41.020> would<00:07:41.230> be<00:07:41.350> the<00:07:41.470> inside<00:07:41.860> curve

00:07:42.270 --> 00:07:42.280 
because that would be the inside curve

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:45.000 
because that would be the inside curve
so<00:07:43.120> then<00:07:43.630> you<00:07:43.750> can<00:07:43.930> come<00:07:44.110> back<00:07:44.140> and<00:07:44.620> just<00:07:44.770> very

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:45.010 
so then you can come back and just very

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:47.910 
so then you can come back and just very
gently<00:07:45.900> Bend<00:07:46.900> those<00:07:47.080> out<00:07:47.320> a<00:07:47.350> little<00:07:47.590> bit<00:07:47.770> the

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:47.920 
gently Bend those out a little bit the

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:50.760 
gently Bend those out a little bit the
other<00:07:47.950> way<00:07:48.810> so<00:07:49.810> each<00:07:50.110> of<00:07:50.290> these<00:07:50.410> corners

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:50.770 
other way so each of these corners

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:54.210 
other way so each of these corners
should<00:07:51.130> be<00:07:51.250> bent<00:07:51.550> so<00:07:51.790> it's<00:07:52.660> just<00:07:52.960> a<00:07:53.220> slight

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:54.220 
should be bent so it's just a slight

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:56.520 
should be bent so it's just a slight
angle<00:07:54.490> like<00:07:54.850> that<00:07:54.960> that<00:07:55.960> way<00:07:56.110> when<00:07:56.290> you<00:07:56.380> go<00:07:56.470> to

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:56.530 
angle like that that way when you go to

00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:58.500 
angle like that that way when you go to
tape<00:07:56.800> them<00:07:57.010> together<00:07:57.190> to<00:07:57.610> make<00:07:57.640> the<00:07:57.820> dome<00:07:58.150> it

00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:58.510 
tape them together to make the dome it

00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:01.170 
tape them together to make the dome it
will<00:07:59.200> want<00:07:59.710> to<00:07:59.830> curve<00:08:00.070> around<00:08:00.250> like<00:08:00.850> the<00:08:01.000> dome

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:01.180 
will want to curve around like the dome

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:03.540 
will want to curve around like the dome
curves
