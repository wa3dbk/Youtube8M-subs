let's go they coming in from now but
here's<00:02:26.709> here's<00:02:27.069> what<00:02:27.130> it<00:02:27.370> is

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
here's here's what it is

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.110 
here's here's what it is
that's<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:28.420> v8<00:02:28.780> lid<00:02:29.500> there's<00:02:30.190> no<00:02:30.370> v6<00:02:30.849> as<00:02:31.000> I

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
that's the v8 lid there's no v6 as I

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.610 
that's the v8 lid there's no v6 as I
could<00:02:31.300> find<00:02:32.670> got<00:02:33.670> the<00:02:33.880> dryer<00:02:34.150> duck

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.259 

this<00:02:36.890> is<00:02:37.010> where<00:02:37.190> the<00:02:37.250> coupler<00:02:37.670> is<00:02:37.819> under<00:02:38.060> here

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
this is where the coupler is under here

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:39.640 
this is where the coupler is under here
that<00:02:38.300> i<00:02:38.480> told<00:02:38.690> you<00:02:38.810> about<00:02:38.900> under<00:02:39.260> here<00:02:39.440> this

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
that i told you about under here this

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.070 
that i told you about under here this
lip<00:02:39.890> put<00:02:40.730> that<00:02:40.879> coupler<00:02:41.269> on<00:02:41.480> that<00:02:41.660> helps<00:02:41.840> make

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
lip put that coupler on that helps make

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.680 
lip put that coupler on that helps make
a<00:02:42.110> good<00:02:42.319> seal<00:02:42.590> here<00:02:42.890> this<00:02:43.790> actually<00:02:44.420> seals

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
a good seal here this actually seals

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.420 
a good seal here this actually seals
pretty<00:02:44.959> good<00:02:45.170> by<00:02:45.319> tightening<00:02:45.830> it<00:02:46.010> pretty

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
pretty good by tightening it pretty

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.190 
pretty good by tightening it pretty
pretty<00:02:46.819> well<00:02:47.620> and<00:02:48.620> then<00:02:48.890> I<00:02:49.220> wrapped<00:02:49.700> the<00:02:50.480> AIC

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
pretty well and then I wrapped the AIC

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.860 
pretty well and then I wrapped the AIC
sensor<00:02:51.890> in<00:02:52.220> electrical<00:02:52.730> tape<00:02:52.910> to<00:02:53.150> make<00:02:53.540> a<00:02:53.599> good

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
sensor in electrical tape to make a good

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.240 
sensor in electrical tape to make a good
seal<00:02:54.049> into<00:02:54.410> the<00:02:54.500> hole<00:02:54.680> right<00:02:54.709> here<00:02:54.890> that<00:02:55.160> they

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
seal into the hole right here that they

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.520 
seal into the hole right here that they
put<00:02:56.920> that's<00:02:57.920> about<00:02:58.160> it<00:02:58.400> I've<00:02:58.730> seen<00:02:58.819> some<00:02:59.239> other

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.750 

I<00:04:09.690> mean<00:04:10.710> increases<00:04:11.710> in<00:04:11.860> power<00:04:12.070> was<00:04:12.430> a<00:04:12.460> little

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
I mean increases in power was a little

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.440 
I mean increases in power was a little
bit<00:04:14.010> mainly<00:04:15.010> get<00:04:15.280> the<00:04:15.400> sound<00:04:15.670> of<00:04:15.970> it<00:04:16.120> which<00:04:16.300> is

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
bit mainly get the sound of it which is

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:17.190 
bit mainly get the sound of it which is
pretty<00:04:16.660> cool

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
pretty cool

pretty cool
makes<00:04:17.560> it<00:04:17.709> worth<00:04:17.860> it<00:04:18.070> I<00:04:18.130> bought<00:04:18.280> the<00:04:18.520> thing<00:04:18.760> on

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
makes it worth it I bought the thing on

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.160 
makes it worth it I bought the thing on
Black<00:04:19.150> Friday<00:04:19.180> so<00:04:19.720> it<00:04:19.810> wasn't<00:04:20.020> a<00:04:20.080> hundred

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.170 
Black Friday so it wasn't a hundred

Black Friday so it wasn't a hundred
bucks<00:04:20.470> for<00:04:20.680> the<00:04:20.739> lid<00:04:20.890> but<00:04:21.130> I<00:04:21.340> would<00:04:21.940> say

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
bucks for the lid but I would say

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.210 
bucks for the lid but I would say
installation<00:04:22.900> in<00:04:23.020> total<00:04:23.470> with<00:04:23.710> electrical

this<00:04:29.890> coupler<00:04:30.280> I<00:04:30.340> got<00:04:30.550> from<00:04:30.700> a<00:04:30.790> specular

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
this coupler I got from a specular

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.240 
this coupler I got from a specular
filter<00:04:31.750> that<00:04:31.900> I<00:04:31.960> used<00:04:32.230> on<00:04:32.410> my<00:04:32.500> other<00:04:32.650> car<00:04:33.040> I

filter that I used on my other car I

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.700 
filter that I used on my other car I
didn't<00:04:33.730> need<00:04:33.880> the<00:04:34.060> couplers<00:04:34.530> suspect<00:04:35.530> air

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
didn't need the couplers suspect air

the<00:04:38.830> bigger<00:04:39.040> size<00:04:39.450> that<00:04:40.450> you'll<00:04:40.600> need<00:04:41.850> you<00:04:42.850> can

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
the bigger size that you'll need you can

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.460 
the bigger size that you'll need you can
use<00:04:43.120> the<00:04:43.240> specter<00:04:43.570> filter<00:04:43.870> for<00:04:44.020> another<00:04:44.230> car

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
use the specter filter for another car

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:45.810 
use the specter filter for another car
you<00:04:44.500> could<00:04:44.890> give<00:04:45.010> it<00:04:45.100> away<00:04:45.190> somebody<00:04:45.670> whatever

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
you want to do with it but you'll

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.050 
you want to do with it but you'll
definitely<00:04:47.500> need<00:04:47.860> the<00:04:48.280> other<00:04:48.430> coupler<00:04:48.850> unless

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
definitely need the other coupler unless

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.170 
definitely need the other coupler unless
you<00:04:49.210> can<00:04:49.360> find<00:04:49.480> another<00:04:49.750> way<00:04:49.900> to<00:04:49.930> seal<00:04:50.230> it<00:04:51.120> so<00:04:52.120> I

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
you can find another way to seal it so I
