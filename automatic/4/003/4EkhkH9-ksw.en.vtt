00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
 yes hello and welcome to 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:11.940
 a new recording of witches yes 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:17.220
 this time a little tutorial for him 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:19.680
 That's why smart terry is so here 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.320
 For a long time I've been wondering how 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.680
 this match works and now I have 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.750
 I found out and I'm up there 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.310
 youtube visited me very long 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.120
 found a tutorial 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:39.660
 that was still English in English 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:43.280
 said master I thought 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.280
 Carry I me times a tutorial for you 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:57.539
 already like 9 x 3 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.969
 surface and wanted to step with this 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.199
 briggs out 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:05.280
 then you take maggie here once 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:08.790
 controller stettin here and on the 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:13.020
 the other side a tank farm tank the 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:16.010
 In the middle there is a break-ball 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.010
 show number here 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:26.299
 and then you do this once outside 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:27.500
 again these briggs funny things and 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:32.800
 then if you work that's why you 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:39.430
 here sometimes sorry for the pattern 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:44.360
 then you do it grass grow on it 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:47.530
 this glass for this year with glass 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.530
 But I have to say that 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:59.000
 there is also the aria windows that works 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:04.130
 I do not think so 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:09.080
 so do not use that the second one 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:16.790
 floor open not yet filled and 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:21.640
 but unfortunately forget that here 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.640
 then you do this make it rains 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:38.739
 then partly and often others 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:42.430
 side one does the same thing I have a lot 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:45.269
 Greater information you can also go here 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.269
 do again 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:53.569
 then the three of them can do it 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.569
 depends on how much you use 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:00.770
 then it just feels that way and then 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.770
 here you also know the lava 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.500
 then the fun can begin 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.500
 oh so 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:12.859
 Another information is 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:12.859
 loud 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.910
 goldbach man it looks like that now 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.890
 No one would need melt with gold bars 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.410
 you should start one wants to be 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:28.090
 come to them because I then need to 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.090
 beginning right at the beginning 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.810
 gold is also pretty fast 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:38.340
 molten 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:41.330
 if she needs her son at obsidian 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.330
 Much longer to melt 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:56.580
 the finished ladies now liquid gold 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:04:01.320
 we do now in here could now 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:02.940
 it's all cool for me and I can 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:11.520
 with another one I'm just falling 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:13.680
 can have committed on the here the 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:15.360
 I think this is for slightly bugged 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.690
 I think sometimes that dries 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.690
 Not 

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:31.030
 ok with minecraft has not crashed 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:37.510
 at the counter 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:41.400
 another gold bar yes sorry can not do anything 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.400
 for it if it wants to dry you 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.440
 thomson 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:59.029
 make the day 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.780
 liquid 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:07.850
 pour it here is all and came 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.920
 does not do it to bake or shit 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:13.060
 to build 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:13.060
 necessary and dry 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:25.360
 or not see 

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:25.360
 then I'll search 

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:37.349
 I do not think so 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:45.889
 here 

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:47.949
 blenk cast or jack ass that you think 

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:54.610
 then in here 

00:05:47.949 --> 00:06:06.649
 Well, that's the way it is, and so on 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:06:08.059
 Now we are doing here in 2008 

00:06:06.649 --> 00:06:10.879
 with the insert 

00:06:08.059 --> 00:06:15.860
 Here we just take it with me 

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:22.219
 from example again a gold gold durex 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:25.789

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:30.860
 realize that crafted as this one here 

00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:33.739
 This charity is like being here 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:36.799
 that was there and that became here and there 

00:06:33.739 --> 00:06:40.699
 Just get in the cloud 

00:06:36.799 --> 00:06:43.449

00:06:43.449 --> 00:06:50.360

00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:53.509

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:31.310
 Goldbacher so I hope you have it 

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:34.320
 fallen and, above all, helped 

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:38.100
 Leave your comment 

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:42.470
 I also liked it because that gives me 

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:44.120
 actually because that tells me something 

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:47.160
 slip of the tongue 

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:49.730
 because that tells me if I did it right 

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:51.780
 or if I did shit 

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:56.030
 I wish you a nice day 

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:56.030
 and I hope to see you again soon
