you<00:01:46.049> just<00:01:46.290> you're<00:01:46.470> going<00:01:46.740> down<00:01:46.890> column<00:01:47.369> after

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
you just you're going down column after

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.639 
you just you're going down column after
column<00:01:48.090> trying<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.570> get<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:48.990> core<00:01:49.170> content

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
column trying to get to the core content

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.319 
column trying to get to the core content
on<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.890> page<00:01:49.920> exactly<00:01:50.790> but<00:01:50.909> it's<00:01:51.060> kind<00:01:51.299> of

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
on the page exactly but it's kind of

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.359 
on the page exactly but it's kind of
difficult<00:01:51.540> in<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.930> pictures<00:01:52.409> don't<00:01:52.920> resize

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
difficult in the pictures don't resize

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.819 
difficult in the pictures don't resize
so<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:54.630> know<00:01:54.750> you<00:01:54.840> just<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.380> have<00:01:55.560> huge

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
so you know you just you have huge

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.469 
so you know you just you have huge
pictures<00:01:56.280> in<00:01:56.430> this<00:01:56.549> little<00:01:56.850> little<00:01:57.210> window

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
pictures in this little little window

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.270 
pictures in this little little window
absolutely<00:01:58.380> so<00:01:58.530> what<00:01:58.680> deep<00:01:58.860> fish<00:01:59.070> does

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
absolutely so what deep fish does

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.310 
absolutely so what deep fish does
instead<00:01:59.549> is<00:01:59.700> it<00:01:59.939> says<00:02:00.090> can<00:02:00.540> we<00:02:00.570> fit<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.110> page

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
instead is it says can we fit the page

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.920 
instead is it says can we fit the page
as<00:02:01.560> designed<00:02:02.189> on<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.000> mobile<00:02:03.180> screen<00:02:03.630> and

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
as designed on to the mobile screen and

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.289 
as designed on to the mobile screen and
then<00:02:04.409> allow<00:02:04.649> users<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.070> actually<00:02:05.369> find<00:02:06.149> the

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
then allow users to actually find the

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.029 
then allow users to actually find the
content<00:02:06.719> they<00:02:06.840> want<00:02:06.869> on<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.259> page<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:07.710> zoom

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039

how<00:03:12.820> do<00:03:12.880> you<00:03:13.000> zoom<00:03:13.030> back<00:03:13.390> out<00:03:13.600> it's<00:03:14.320> simple

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
how do you zoom back out it's simple

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.810 
how do you zoom back out it's simple
just<00:03:14.650> hit<00:03:14.890> the<00:03:15.010> back<00:03:15.160> button<00:03:15.190> on<00:03:15.610> your<00:03:15.670> phone

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
just hit the back button on your phone

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.670 
just hit the back button on your phone
or<00:03:16.360> if<00:03:16.510> you're<00:03:16.630> using<00:03:16.780> a<00:03:16.870> pocket<00:03:17.170> pc<00:03:17.410> you<00:03:17.500> just

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
or if you're using a pocket pc you just

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.560 
or if you're using a pocket pc you just
hold<00:03:17.800> the<00:03:17.980> center<00:03:18.130> button<00:03:18.250> and<00:03:18.730> the<00:03:19.180> browser

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
hold the center button and the browser

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.540 
hold the center button and the browser
will<00:03:19.840> automatically<00:03:20.230> zoom<00:03:20.470> back<00:03:20.650> out<00:03:20.890> so<00:03:21.430> it

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 
will automatically zoom back out so it

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.130 
will automatically zoom back out so it
just<00:03:21.730> uses<00:03:21.910> the<00:03:22.120> different<00:03:22.540> views<00:03:22.840> of<00:03:23.050> the

just uses the different views of the
same<00:03:23.320> page<00:03:23.620> just<00:03:24.460> as<00:03:24.610> if<00:03:24.730> they<00:03:24.850> were<00:03:24.910> forward

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300

zoom<00:04:02.290> in<00:04:02.800> it's<00:04:03.220> either<00:04:03.340> got<00:04:03.580> all<00:04:03.730> the<00:04:03.820> tiles

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
much like Virtual Earth enables the map

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.880 
much like Virtual Earth enables the map
to<00:04:10.360> load<00:04:10.510> very<00:04:10.720> very<00:04:10.870> quickly<00:04:11.110> and<00:04:11.500> then<00:04:11.560> zoom

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
to load very very quickly and then zoom

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.280 
to load very very quickly and then zoom
in<00:04:12.100> to<00:04:12.250> get<00:04:12.490> more<00:04:12.700> and<00:04:12.850> more<00:04:12.880> detail<00:04:13.420> deep<00:04:14.080> fish

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
in to get more and more detail deep fish

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.650 
in to get more and more detail deep fish
does<00:04:14.620> the<00:04:14.770> same<00:04:15.040> thing<00:04:15.340> for<00:04:15.520> web<00:04:15.700> pages<00:04:15.940> so

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
does the same thing for web pages so

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:18.660 
does the same thing for web pages so
it's<00:04:16.810> a<00:04:16.900> much<00:04:17.049> quicker<00:04:17.350> download<00:04:18.040> experience

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:18.670 
it's a much quicker download experience

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:20.160 
it's a much quicker download experience
it's<00:04:18.880> a<00:04:18.970> much<00:04:19.090> smoother<00:04:19.570> navigation

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.170 
it's a much smoother navigation

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.140 
it's a much smoother navigation
experience<00:04:20.549> one<00:04:21.549> of<00:04:21.609> the<00:04:21.700> things<00:04:21.790> I<00:04:21.970> really

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
experience one of the things I really

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.580 
experience one of the things I really
like<00:04:22.390> about<00:04:22.450> it<00:04:22.780> too<00:04:22.930> is<00:04:23.080> when<00:04:23.200> you're<00:04:23.350> zoomed

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
like about it too is when you're zoomed

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:24.240 
like about it too is when you're zoomed
in<00:04:23.770> you've<00:04:23.950> got

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
in you've got

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.880 
in you've got
q<00:04:24.430> map<00:04:24.610> and<00:04:25.200> that<00:04:26.200> kind<00:04:26.380> of<00:04:26.410> tells<00:04:26.590> you<00:04:26.740> where

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:26.890 
q map and that kind of tells you where

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:28.620 
q map and that kind of tells you where
you're<00:04:27.010> at<00:04:27.160> in<00:04:27.310> the<00:04:27.400> page<00:04:27.610> and<00:04:27.910> how<00:04:28.480> you're

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
you're at in the page and how you're

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.630 
you're at in the page and how you're
navigating<00:04:28.780> up<00:04:29.260> and<00:04:29.410> down<00:04:29.590> yeah<00:04:29.950> the<00:04:30.130> Q<00:04:30.340> map<00:04:30.490> is

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:30.640 
navigating up and down yeah the Q map is

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:31.830 
navigating up and down yeah the Q map is
a<00:04:30.670> unique<00:04:31.060> feature<00:04:31.270> because<00:04:31.480> you're<00:04:31.780> not

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
a unique feature because you're not

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.480

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
always going to have to go back to that

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.670
