a<00:00:26.830> scarf<00:00:27.550> of<00:00:27.730> this<00:00:27.939> volume<00:00:28.390> would<00:00:28.510> take<00:00:28.720> a<00:00:28.750> long

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:29.080 
a scarf of this volume would take a long

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.259 
a scarf of this volume would take a long
time<00:00:29.140> to<00:00:29.679> make<00:00:29.830> but<00:00:30.310> if<00:00:30.429> you<00:00:30.519> notice<00:00:30.880> the<00:00:31.029> yarn

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:31.269 
time to make but if you notice the yarn

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:33.570 
time to make but if you notice the yarn
itself<00:00:31.660> already<00:00:32.259> has<00:00:32.500> stitches<00:00:32.830> worked<00:00:33.250> into

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:33.580 
itself already has stitches worked into

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.640 
itself already has stitches worked into
it<00:00:33.730> so<00:00:34.090> you're<00:00:34.240> just<00:00:34.540> creating<00:00:34.840> the<00:00:35.200> volume

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:35.650 
it so you're just creating the volume

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.830 
it so you're just creating the volume
and<00:00:35.890> let<00:00:36.190> me<00:00:36.280> show<00:00:36.490> you<00:00:36.550> how<00:00:36.790> we<00:00:36.850> do<00:00:37.120> that<00:00:37.150> from

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:37.840 
and let me show you how we do that from

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.170 
and let me show you how we do that from
the<00:00:37.960> very<00:00:38.140> beginning<00:00:38.410> when<00:00:39.070> we<00:00:39.220> take<00:00:39.490> a<00:00:39.670> skein

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180 
the very beginning when we take a skein

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.130 
the very beginning when we take a skein
of<00:00:40.420> Rigoletto

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:41.140 
of Rigoletto

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.710 
of Rigoletto
when<00:00:41.320> I<00:00:41.350> say<00:00:41.650> skein<00:00:42.040> not<00:00:42.370> ball<00:00:42.700> it's<00:00:43.090> because

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:43.720 
when I say skein not ball it's because

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.560 
when I say skein not ball it's because
it's<00:00:43.930> wound<00:00:44.230> into<00:00:44.710> a<00:00:44.740> loop<00:00:45.130> and<00:00:45.850> I'm<00:00:46.360> going<00:00:46.540> to

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
it's wound into a loop and I'm going to

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.000 
it's wound into a loop and I'm going to
show<00:00:46.810> you<00:00:46.840> what<00:00:47.230> that<00:00:47.260> looks<00:00:47.740> like

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
show you what that looks like

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.000 
show you what that looks like
see<00:00:48.790> it's<00:00:49.030> a<00:00:50.580> loop<00:00:51.580> of<00:00:51.760> yarn

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
see it's a loop of yarn

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.830 
see it's a loop of yarn
you're<00:00:54.010> gonna<00:00:54.100> unwind<00:00:54.880> it<00:00:55.180> and<00:00:55.330> you<00:00:55.480> can<00:00:55.630> work

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
you're gonna unwind it and you can work

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.780 
you're gonna unwind it and you can work
right<00:00:56.140> from<00:00:56.560> this<00:00:56.860> you<00:00:57.190> don't<00:00:57.370> actually<00:00:57.550> have

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
right from this you don't actually have

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.700 
right from this you don't actually have
to<00:00:57.850> wind<00:00:58.150> it<00:00:58.270> into<00:00:58.540> a<00:00:58.570> ball<00:00:58.810> unless<00:00:59.230> you<00:00:59.380> really

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
to wind it into a ball unless you really

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.740 
to wind it into a ball unless you really
wanted<00:01:00.070> to<00:01:00.100> but<00:01:00.850> what<00:01:00.970> we're<00:01:01.120> gonna<00:01:01.210> do<00:01:01.510> is

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
wanted to but what we're gonna do is

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.930 
wanted to but what we're gonna do is
want<00:01:02.410> what<00:01:02.860> you're<00:01:02.980> looking<00:01:03.310> for<00:01:03.550> is<00:01:03.730> this

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
want what you're looking for is this

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.840 
want what you're looking for is this
loop<00:01:04.299> like<00:01:04.750> that<00:01:04.780> and<00:01:05.350> there'll<00:01:05.890> be<00:01:05.980> it<00:01:06.490> in

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
loop like that and there'll be it in

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.760 
loop like that and there'll be it in
order<00:01:07.060> to<00:01:07.240> secure<00:01:07.600> it<00:01:07.750> before<00:01:08.110> that<00:01:08.260> band<00:01:08.500> goes

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
order to secure it before that band goes

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.960 
order to secure it before that band goes
on<00:01:08.980> it's<00:01:09.490> tied<00:01:09.880> into<00:01:11.220> with<00:01:12.220> a<00:01:12.250> little<00:01:12.550> string<00:01:12.820> I

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
on it's tied into with a little string I

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.760 
on it's tied into with a little string I
was<00:01:13.120> able<00:01:13.270> to<00:01:13.420> look<00:01:13.750> slightly<00:01:14.080> pull<00:01:14.500> it<00:01:14.650> and

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
was able to look slightly pull it and

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.500 
was able to look slightly pull it and
pull<00:01:14.830> it<00:01:15.370> apart<00:01:15.460> if<00:01:15.820> not<00:01:16.030> you<00:01:16.180> could<00:01:16.330> use<00:01:16.480> a

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:16.510 
pull it apart if not you could use a

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.360 
pull it apart if not you could use a
pair<00:01:16.810> of<00:01:16.840> scissors<00:01:17.080> to<00:01:17.260> snip<00:01:17.470> that<00:01:17.860> off<00:01:17.920> and

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:18.370 
pair of scissors to snip that off and

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.250 
pair of scissors to snip that off and
what<00:01:18.760> that<00:01:18.940> does<00:01:19.120> is<00:01:19.270> secure<00:01:19.720> it<00:01:19.810> into<00:01:20.020> this

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:20.260 
what that does is secure it into this

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.990 
what that does is secure it into this
loop<00:01:20.560> now<00:01:21.040> if<00:01:21.190> you're<00:01:21.310> going<00:01:21.490> to<00:01:21.610> work<00:01:21.760> this

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
loop now if you're going to work this

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000 
loop now if you're going to work this
scarf<00:01:22.360> all<00:01:22.570> in<00:01:22.750> one<00:01:22.930> setting<00:01:23.200> and<00:01:23.500> it's<00:01:23.650> so

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:24.010 
scarf all in one setting and it's so

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.490

fast<00:01:24.430> you<00:01:24.730> can<00:01:24.910> actually<00:01:25.150> work<00:01:25.720> the<00:01:25.990> scarf<00:01:26.290> in

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
fast you can actually work the scarf in

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.210 
fast you can actually work the scarf in
one<00:01:26.770> sitting

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
one sitting

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.550 
one sitting
otherwise<00:01:28.000> you<00:01:28.660> would<00:01:28.780> want<00:01:28.990> to<00:01:29.080> wind<00:01:29.320> this

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
otherwise you would want to wind this

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.649 
otherwise you would want to wind this
into<00:01:29.950> a<00:01:29.980> loose<00:01:30.250> ball<00:01:30.580> before<00:01:31.030> going<00:01:31.240> forward

into a loose ball before going forward

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:33.840 
into a loose ball before going forward
at<00:01:31.900> this<00:01:32.020> point<00:01:32.140> the<00:01:32.800> beginning<00:01:33.250> is<00:01:33.370> tied<00:01:33.640> into

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
at this point the beginning is tied into

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.940 
at this point the beginning is tied into
a<00:01:34.030> knot<00:01:34.120> here<00:01:34.870> and<00:01:35.080> I'm<00:01:35.409> going<00:01:35.530> to<00:01:35.620> use<00:01:35.770> my

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:41.980 
loosely alright so we've got a raw edge

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.770 
loosely alright so we've got a raw edge
here<00:01:42.340> so<00:01:42.370> what<00:01:42.610> we<00:01:42.700> want<00:01:42.909> to<00:01:43.000> do<00:01:43.120> is<00:01:43.420> stretch

here so what we want to do is stretch
the<00:01:43.990> fabric<00:01:44.170> out<00:01:44.530> a<00:01:44.560> little<00:01:44.800> bit<00:01:45.070> and<00:01:45.280> then

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
the fabric out a little bit and then

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.060 
the fabric out a little bit and then
fold<00:01:45.790> it<00:01:45.940> over<00:01:46.240> little<00:01:46.780> but<00:01:47.050> just<00:01:47.620> about<00:01:47.800> two

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070

inches we're gonna be working in two

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.750 
inches we're gonna be working in two
inch<00:01:49.720> increments<00:01:50.290> for<00:01:50.500> stitching<00:01:51.159> so<00:01:51.580> we're

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:51.760 
inch increments for stitching so we're

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.230
