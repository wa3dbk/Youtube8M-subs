00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.590
 of a make-up brand of which she had 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.010

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:53.220
 Washable with very dramatic lipstick well rost 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.410
 Pink I loved everything doing for you 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.060
 I hope you like it a little bit 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.890
 different from what I'm accustomed to 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:01.650
 little more colorful as you are 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:28.759

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:47.130
 at the bottom of it and try to green 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:52.229

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:54.960

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.880
 Sorry for the terrible noise of 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.250
 construction of the captain already makes a three 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.040
 years and nothing happened with the 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:06.810
 So there's no way it's going to be on camera. 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:10.640
 so I'll step inside my eye 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.640
 and I'll come with it until the end 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:24.550

 until now 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:03:08.230
 in the beginning I can well round I think 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:12.310
 There is no way to compensate 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:14.970

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.970
