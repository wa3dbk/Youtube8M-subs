00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.920 
actually looks pretty sweet though
because<00:03:26.550> when<00:03:26.940> you're<00:03:27.090> looking<00:03:27.510> at<00:03:27.690> it<00:03:27.810> you're

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
because when you're looking at it you're

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.540 
because when you're looking at it you're
on<00:03:28.080> a<00:03:28.110> mine<00:03:28.350> cart<00:03:28.620> and<00:03:28.800> you<00:03:28.920> can<00:03:29.070> just<00:03:29.280> see<00:03:29.520> it

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
on a mine cart and you can just see it

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.420 
on a mine cart and you can just see it
as<00:03:29.850> you're<00:03:30.239> like<00:03:30.480> you<00:03:30.780> know<00:03:30.810> writing<00:03:31.260> by<00:03:31.530> and<00:03:31.830> I

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
as you're like you know writing by and I

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:33.800 
as you're like you know writing by and I
think<00:03:32.670> that's<00:03:32.850> pretty<00:03:33.060> cool<00:03:33.360> so<00:03:33.570> you<00:03:33.660> got<00:03:33.780> a

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
think that's pretty cool so you got a

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.810 
think that's pretty cool so you got a
different<00:03:34.260> point<00:03:34.440> of<00:03:34.590> view<00:03:34.830> from<00:03:35.280> looking<00:03:35.670> at

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
different point of view from looking at

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.600 
different point of view from looking at
it<00:03:36.000> and<00:03:36.230> I<00:03:37.230> think<00:03:37.830> this<00:03:37.920> world<00:03:38.220> must<00:03:38.400> have

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
it and I think this world must have

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:40.820 
it and I think this world must have
taken<00:03:38.760> a<00:03:38.970> lot<00:03:39.090> of<00:03:39.150> time<00:03:39.450> to<00:03:40.020> you<00:03:40.410> know<00:03:40.530> create
