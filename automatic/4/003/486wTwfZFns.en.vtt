00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.340
 nitrogen is one of the most important elements 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.390
 important that contribute to development 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.610
 of the plant 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:29.010
 therefore when it fails i 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.010
 symptoms are varied and obvious 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.780
 in general there is a development 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.090
 more stunted than the plant at times 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.830
 degenerates into a real onanism 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.370
 due to reduced activity 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:46.010
 the photosynthetic leaves are indeed 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.110
 chlorosis yellowing prey that yes 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.510
 manifested initially on most leaves 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.050
 old at the base of copper for later 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.970
 extend also to the top ones 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:01:00.640
 the yellowing then follows the 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.640
 necrosis and the fall of the leaves themselves 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:07.100
 another serious consequence of the lack 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.440
 nitrogen is the sterility of the plant with 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.410
 an easy detachment of flowers and in 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.990
 followed by the fall of the fruit trees if 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:19.180
 also the fruits come to form them 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.180
 they are not very juicy and seedless 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.390
 in general the plant ages more 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.690
 quickly and is easily prey to 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.840
 pests and fungal diseases also 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.250
 it is less resistant to frost 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.680
 all these symptoms are 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.860
 particularly evident in the plants of 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.990
 citrus fruits and in particular of the lemon which 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:44.010
 offers a complete sample of the 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:46.530
 consequences of lack of nitrogen 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:49.050
 nitrogen deficiencies usually occur 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.240
 in periods of higher growth as in 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:53.009
 spring when the need for it 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:57.000
 vegetative development of the plant is 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:59.180
 elevated therefore the fertilizations will have to 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.770
 be more frequent at that time 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.750
 be careful not to overdo it 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.509
 doses because in this case the 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.270
 fertilization would be reversed 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:12.480
 damaging carefully 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.430
 interventions before applying them 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.590
 keep in mind that nitrogen is a 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.580
 easily washable element in the 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.520
 ground 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.420
 therefore avoid the rainiest periods in 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.760
 general 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.970
 well stagger the fertilizers into a 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.549
 longer period so we recommend 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:32.220
 stagger the fertilizer in more time 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:35.150
 dilated trying to avoid excesses of 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.150
 nitrogen in the soil 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.440
 intervene during shooting 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.570
 vegetative and growth though 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.269
 a small but constant fertilizing 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.420
 nitrogen can be carried out in all 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.420
 the year
