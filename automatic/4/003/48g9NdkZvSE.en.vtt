00:00:03.089 --> 00:00:06.089
 lights 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:17.660
 Hello 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:20.300
 my little things and well then today 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.310
 I'm going to show you how to be a pen holder 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.360
 this becomes a pen holder 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.760
 a 'botellÃ³n' 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.240
 let's cut it in the moment tell 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:32.150
 like but let's visit a bottle 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:36.020
 adhesive tape a simple pen 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:39.500
 dictated a periodic rule glue 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:42.140
 white glue white white paper 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.410
 normal and an adhesive pencil 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:48.410
 first let's record the bottle that 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.760
 we ask after we go to the rule and what 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.760
 what we are going to do is to measure the 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.340
 space that we are going to occupy for 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.620
 then cover it and make our 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:00.490
 pencil portal since we have measured what 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:03.610
 What are we going to do then 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:08.230
 we grab a leaf 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:11.230
 normal let's start marking it 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.230
 carefully 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.530
 so that he wants us to go we have like this 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.479
 mark 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.420
 since this marked base we are going to give 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:23.619
 our scissors 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.939
 and we are going to cut it so that later 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:29.780
 as we wanted to overtake and we do not have 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:32.450
 a lot of time we stayed like this 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.850
 since it's like this then we're going to give 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.400
 our bottle 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.729
 and we are going to attach as we see that if 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.729
 remains 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.510
 let's make our scissors and let's 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.610
 cutting the pharmacy would be easier with a 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.320
 cutter but as production does not have 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.310
 cutter then we have to do the 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.280
 fight the budget 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:59.680
 be careful not to leave 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.680
 cut your delicate as nails 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:07.670
 we make ourselves the surplus and we put it 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:11.420
 where we want free demanded 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:15.580
 of what is a stage later we are going to 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.580
 use little adhesive pencil 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:22.230
 and we're going to put like that it does not seem and it's not what 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:24.140
 that you think dirty is just a pencil 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.560
 adhesive 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:30.620
 we stick it carefully 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.470
 and we started spinning and where 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.830
 stay 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:38.650
 then we are going to put again the 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:41.440
 saying pizza will be after we're going to 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.360
 start to mark our newspaper with 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.390
 the measure that we already had 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:49.000
 that is so then we proceed to 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:52.450
 cut delicately so that after 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.760
 we left strips of that size that if 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.370
 we see it is the size of the bottle what 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.769
 let's do 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.450
 rolls with nothing inside only the 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:03.989
 rollito again with our pencil 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:06.220
 adhesive pencil sticker here we can not 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:08.020
 say nothing of brand 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:12.220
 and we are going here we will stay 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:14.320
 rolls like that with nothing inside 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.770
 rollitos and I do not know in what moments that 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.770
 they came out so 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.849
 we grab our glue bottle 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.620
 white white not our white color what 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:27.690
 they can be where you want but 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:31.350
 better in a stationery 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:33.810
 then we put a little bit of glue in the 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:38.630
 newspaper to possibly grab 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.630
 our bottle and paste it carefully 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.900
 well already after they were baby 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.180
 one by one 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:53.000
 This is how we are doing, we have 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.829
 no craft mom can not separate 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.650
 as you want with little flowers 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:59.930
 color silos with little flags bows you're 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:03.500
 so but to see how it is 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:07.310
 decorated I need or I would like me 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:09.650
 give a like on the facebook here 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:14.209
 I leave my instagram 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:15.590
 my twitter to do with the and messiah and 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:17.389
 apart from above 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.070
 enough for them to subscribe to the channel and 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:22.039
 they will be able to see many more surprises 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:25.580
 crafts of my little things and more more 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:27.259
 more more and more and more and more good things 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.050
 then this that would be it for the day 

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:33.230
 today next time I have another 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:37.190

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:42.520
 be afraid to show your true 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:42.520
