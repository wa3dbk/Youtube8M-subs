there's<00:05:44.730> things<00:05:45.270> and<00:05:45.570> obstacles<00:05:46.080> creating

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470 
there's things and obstacles creating

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:48.020 
there's things and obstacles creating
very<00:05:46.680> different<00:05:47.070> playstyles<00:05:47.280> throughout<00:05:47.910> the

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.030 
very different playstyles throughout the

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:49.640 
very different playstyles throughout the
game<00:05:48.150> would<00:05:48.360> be<00:05:48.390> hard<00:05:48.720> however<00:05:49.290> if<00:05:49.470> its

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:49.650 
game would be hard however if its

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.290 
game would be hard however if its
mission<00:05:50.040> base<00:05:50.220> is<00:05:50.400> a<00:05:50.490> little<00:05:50.730> bit<00:05:50.850> less<00:05:51.030> hard

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
mission base is a little bit less hard

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:53.060 
mission base is a little bit less hard
they<00:05:51.420> can<00:05:51.480> dedicate<00:05:52.110> just<00:05:52.470> the<00:05:52.590> mission<00:05:52.920> and

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.070 
they can dedicate just the mission and

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:54.770 
they can dedicate just the mission and
not<00:05:53.130> an<00:05:53.280> open<00:05:53.580> world<00:05:53.760> where<00:05:54.270> everybody<00:05:54.450> runs

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 
not an open world where everybody runs

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.630 
not an open world where everybody runs
around<00:05:54.900> like<00:05:55.050> crazy<00:05:55.290> but<00:05:56.040> having<00:05:56.340> a<00:05:56.430> dedicated

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:56.640 
around like crazy but having a dedicated

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.490 
around like crazy but having a dedicated
mission<00:05:57.270> based<00:05:57.480> game<00:05:57.690> I<00:05:57.840> think<00:05:58.110> a<00:05:58.200> lot<00:05:58.230> of

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.500 
mission based game I think a lot of

00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:59.990 
mission based game I think a lot of
people<00:05:58.620> would<00:05:59.010> get<00:05:59.130> to<00:05:59.250> play<00:05:59.430> as<00:05:59.460> their<00:05:59.670> heroes

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 
people would get to play as their heroes

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.150 
people would get to play as their heroes
like<00:06:00.240> they<00:06:00.390> always<00:06:00.630> wanted<00:06:01.200> to<00:06:01.380> and<00:06:01.560> have<00:06:01.920> very
