we're gonna get down to business and
show<00:00:50.550> you<00:00:50.610> each<00:00:50.760> one<00:00:50.910> of<00:00:51.059> those<00:00:51.890> first<00:00:52.890> there's

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
show you each one of those first there's

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.760 
show you each one of those first there's
the<00:00:53.250> cortex<00:00:53.760> screw<00:00:54.120> it's<00:00:54.989> very<00:00:55.230> unique<00:00:55.410> and

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
the cortex screw it's very unique and

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.880 
the cortex screw it's very unique and
then<00:00:56.100> it's<00:00:56.250> highly<00:00:56.820> engineered<00:00:57.890> especially

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
then it's highly engineered especially

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.380 
then it's highly engineered especially
at<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.129> head<00:00:59.309> where<00:00:59.489> that<00:00:59.640> diameter<00:01:00.210> is

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
at the head where that diameter is

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.470 
at the head where that diameter is
critical<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.260> you'll<00:01:01.559> see<00:01:01.770> why<00:01:01.949> in<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.160> bit

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
critical and you'll see why in a bit

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.509 
critical and you'll see why in a bit
second<00:01:03.480> there's<00:01:04.019> dual<00:01:04.350> thread<00:01:04.680> technology

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
second there's dual thread technology

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.929 
second there's dual thread technology
two<00:01:06.360> separate<00:01:06.810> threads<00:01:07.140> that<00:01:07.830> when<00:01:08.070> placed

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
two separate threads that when placed

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.240 
two separate threads that when placed
into<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.420> application<00:01:10.080> leave<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.439> nice<00:01:10.710> cord

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
into the application leave a nice cord

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.270 
into the application leave a nice cord
out<00:01:11.369> hole<00:01:12.170> just<00:01:13.170> as<00:01:13.350> important<00:01:13.830> is<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:13.950> fact

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
out hole just as important is the fact

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.030 
out hole just as important is the fact
that<00:01:14.520> we<00:01:14.790> have<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.000> tested<00:01:15.570> coating<00:01:16.080> specific

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
that we have a tested coating specific

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.850 
that we have a tested coating specific
for<00:01:17.220> a<00:01:17.250> CQ<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.119> those<00:01:18.540> other

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
for a CQ and those other

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.850 
for a CQ and those other
pressure-treated<00:01:19.860> chemicals<00:01:21.619> next<00:01:22.619> is<00:01:22.740> the

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
pressure-treated chemicals next is the

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.490 
pressure-treated chemicals next is the
cortex<00:01:23.310> setting<00:01:23.700> tool<00:01:23.880> it's<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.900> square<00:01:25.200> drive

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
cortex setting tool it's a square drive

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.130 
cortex setting tool it's a square drive
but<00:01:25.860> it's<00:01:25.979> unique<00:01:26.100> in<00:01:26.430> two<00:01:26.580> features<00:01:27.030> one<00:01:27.930> is<00:01:27.960> a

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
but it's unique in two features one is a

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.749 
but it's unique in two features one is a
non<00:01:28.409> marring<00:01:28.770> shoulder<00:01:29.340> so<00:01:29.520> when<00:01:29.640> you're

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
non marring shoulder so when you're

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.760 
non marring shoulder so when you're
setting<00:01:30.000> this<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.420> depth<00:01:30.689> it<00:01:31.170> doesn't<00:01:31.590> create

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
setting this to depth it doesn't create

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.910 
setting this to depth it doesn't create
any<00:01:32.009> abrasion<00:01:32.880> on<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.030> surface<00:01:33.420> of<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.630> deck

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
any abrasion on the surface of the deck

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.289 
any abrasion on the surface of the deck
second<00:01:34.920> is<00:01:34.979> it's<00:01:35.159> spring-loaded<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:36.030> that<00:01:36.150> is

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
second is it's spring-loaded and that is

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.539 
second is it's spring-loaded and that is
specific<00:01:36.810> because<00:01:37.079> it<00:01:37.650> wants<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.070> release<00:01:38.340> the

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
specific because it wants to release the

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.700 
specific because it wants to release the
screw<00:01:38.790> at<00:01:38.970> just<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.509> right<00:01:39.659> depth<00:01:39.960> for<00:01:40.650> the

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
screw at just the right depth for the

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.190 
screw at just the right depth for the
next<00:01:40.979> step<00:01:41.390> finally<00:01:42.390> there's<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.720> cortex

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
next step finally there's the cortex

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.219 
next step finally there's the cortex
plug<00:01:44.149> what's<00:01:45.149> unique<00:01:45.420> about<00:01:45.540> this<00:01:45.869> is<00:01:45.930> it's

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
plug what's unique about this is it's

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.530 
plug what's unique about this is it's
made<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.740> same<00:01:46.950> material<00:01:47.850> as<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.030> deck

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
made of the same material as the deck

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.330 
made of the same material as the deck
board<00:01:48.810> so<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.530> has<00:01:49.680> all<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.130> same

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
board so it has all the same

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.240 
board so it has all the same
characteristics<00:01:51.619> second<00:01:52.619> and<00:01:52.740> most

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
characteristics second and most

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.310 
characteristics second and most
important<00:01:53.850> is<00:01:53.970> it's<00:01:54.360> engineered<00:01:54.899> to<00:01:55.079> very

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
important is it's engineered to very

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.649 
important is it's engineered to very
tight<00:01:55.560> tolerance<00:01:56.040> much<00:01:56.460> like<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.820> screw<00:01:57.119> so

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
tight tolerance much like the screw so

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.380 
tight tolerance much like the screw so
it<00:01:57.780> fits<00:01:58.200> tight<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.710> it<00:01:59.009> stays<00:01:59.280> there<00:01:59.390> now

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
it fits tight and it stays there now

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.030 
it fits tight and it stays there now
that<00:02:00.570> we've<00:02:00.689> seen<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.960> components<00:02:01.469> let's<00:02:01.799> put

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
that we've seen the components let's put

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.889 
that we've seen the components let's put
