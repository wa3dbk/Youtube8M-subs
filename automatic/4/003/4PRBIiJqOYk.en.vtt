00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
not like hovering right above your

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.390 
not like hovering right above your
orbital<00:01:13.750> you're<00:01:14.020> right<00:01:14.140> here<00:01:14.290> actually<00:01:14.440> these

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400 
orbital you're right here actually these

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.399 
orbital you're right here actually these
guys<00:01:15.549> had<00:01:15.729> to<00:01:15.760> Don<00:01:16.000> spacesuits<00:01:16.659> right<00:01:17.080> your

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:17.409 
guys had to Don spacesuits right your

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:19.710 
guys had to Don spacesuits right your
suborbital<00:01:17.979> at<00:01:18.040> this<00:01:18.159> point<00:01:18.400> now<00:01:18.909> um<00:01:19.180> what

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
suborbital at this point now um what

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.480 
suborbital at this point now um what
this<00:01:19.900> demonstrates<00:01:20.440> I<00:01:20.500> think<00:01:20.680> immediately<00:01:20.979> is

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
this demonstrates I think immediately is

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.310 
this demonstrates I think immediately is
you<00:01:21.790> know<00:01:21.880> earlier<00:01:22.390> in<00:01:22.540> the<00:01:22.630> show<00:01:22.659> we<00:01:22.840> saw<00:01:23.290> a

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
you know earlier in the show we saw a

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.930 
you know earlier in the show we saw a
helicopter<00:01:23.619> just<00:01:24.159> blowing<00:01:24.430> the<00:01:24.520> crap<00:01:24.729> out<00:01:24.909> of

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 
helicopter just blowing the crap out of

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.760 
helicopter just blowing the crap out of
everything<00:01:25.330> you<00:01:26.080> are<00:01:26.200> going<00:01:26.440> for<00:01:26.470> very

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
everything you are going for very

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.410 
everything you are going for very
different<00:01:26.979> where's<00:01:27.430> that<00:01:27.670> except<00:01:27.909> from<00:01:28.060> level

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
different where's that except from level

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.210 
different where's that except from level
to<00:01:28.510> level<00:01:28.540> I<00:01:28.840> mean<00:01:28.869> watch<00:01:29.650> much<00:01:29.920> of<00:01:30.040> a<00:01:30.100> loser

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
to level I mean watch much of a loser

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.680 
to level I mean watch much of a loser
right<00:01:30.400> here<00:01:30.670> we<00:01:30.820> can<00:01:30.970> we<00:01:31.060> expect<00:01:31.300> from<00:01:31.420> black

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
right here we can we expect from black

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.360 
right here we can we expect from black
ops<00:01:31.900> that<00:01:32.170> is<00:01:32.320> you<00:01:32.590> know<00:01:32.710> that's<00:01:33.220> actually

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:33.370 
ops that is you know that's actually

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:34.590 
ops that is you know that's actually
something<00:01:33.580> we've<00:01:33.790> been<00:01:33.820> going<00:01:34.090> for<00:01:34.120> level<00:01:34.570> a

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
something we've been going for level a

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.750 
something we've been going for level a
variety<00:01:34.990> so<00:01:35.200> pacing<00:01:35.770> in<00:01:35.860> this<00:01:36.010> there's<00:01:36.670> a

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:36.760 
variety so pacing in this there's a

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.640 
variety so pacing in this there's a
setup<00:01:37.120> here<00:01:37.330> obviously<00:01:37.650> completely

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 
setup here obviously completely

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.500 
setup here obviously completely
different<00:01:39.430> than<00:01:39.580> the<00:01:39.670> all-out<00:01:39.850> action<00:01:40.060> you

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
different than the all-out action you

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.050 
different than the all-out action you
just<00:01:40.720> you<00:01:41.080> saw<00:01:41.260> what<00:01:41.470> payback<00:01:41.650> earlier<00:01:42.190> so

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
just you saw what payback earlier so

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.490 
just you saw what payback earlier so
we're<00:01:43.180> doing<00:01:43.360> the<00:01:43.420> setup<00:01:43.690> here<00:01:43.930> and<00:01:44.080> you're

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
we're doing the setup here and you're

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.980 
we're doing the setup here and you're
controlling<00:01:44.860> the<00:01:45.040> squad<00:01:45.370> but<00:01:45.580> then<00:01:45.820> in<00:01:46.060> a

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
controlling the squad but then in a

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:48.030 
controlling the squad but then in a
couple<00:01:47.110> of<00:01:47.290> seconds<00:01:47.590> what<00:01:47.680> we're<00:01:47.770> going<00:01:47.860> to<00:01:47.950> do

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
couple of seconds what we're going to do

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.750 
couple of seconds what we're going to do

action<00:04:43.020> movie<00:04:43.260> I<00:04:43.290> think<00:04:43.530> what<00:04:43.620> we<00:04:43.710> saw<00:04:43.860> before

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:43.890 
action movie I think what we saw before

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:45.560 
action movie I think what we saw before
for<00:04:44.340> a<00:04:44.370> little<00:04:44.460> bit<00:04:44.610> more<00:04:44.760> towards<00:04:45.060> units<00:04:45.420> or

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
for a little bit more towards units or

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.660 
for a little bit more towards units or
the<00:04:45.630> realism<00:04:46.170> of<00:04:46.500> combat<00:04:47.280> in<00:04:47.430> a<00:04:47.490> particular
