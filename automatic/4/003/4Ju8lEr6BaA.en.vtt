00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:35.800 
so I'm gonna mark that and try and get
as<00:01:33.950> even<00:01:34.279> as<00:01:34.369> possible<00:01:34.399> on<00:01:34.909> my<00:01:35.060> second<00:01:35.659> shoe

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
as even as possible on my second shoe

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.410 
as even as possible on my second shoe
that's<00:01:36.109> the<00:01:36.259> hardest<00:01:36.560> part<00:01:36.649> I<00:01:36.799> think

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.730 

these<00:01:41.420> are<00:01:41.540> really<00:01:41.659> great<00:01:41.930> shoes<00:01:42.140> to<00:01:42.320> have<00:01:42.500> for

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
these are really great shoes to have for

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.620 
these are really great shoes to have for
the<00:01:42.830> season<00:01:43.159> also<00:01:43.340> because<00:01:43.909> Louie<00:01:44.450> Vuitton

the season also because Louie Vuitton

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.590 
the season also because Louie Vuitton

Valentino<00:01:48.140> all<00:01:48.350> the<00:01:48.650> big<00:01:48.800> brands<00:01:49.070> should<00:01:49.640> very

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
Valentino all the big brands should very

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.640 
Valentino all the big brands should very
prim<00:01:50.090> and<00:01:50.180> proper<00:01:50.330> ladylike<00:01:50.869> looks<00:01:51.140> and<00:01:51.560> I

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650 
prim and proper ladylike looks and I

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.170 
prim and proper ladylike looks and I
think<00:01:51.830> this<00:01:51.920> is<00:01:52.010> a<00:01:52.040> really<00:01:52.250> easy<00:01:52.280> way<00:01:52.640> to<00:01:52.670> where

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
think this is a really easy way to where

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.910 
think this is a really easy way to where
the<00:01:53.330> trend<00:01:53.540> without<00:01:53.659> being<00:01:53.810> so<00:01:54.560> on<00:01:54.710> the<00:01:54.830> nose

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
the trend without being so on the nose

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.950 
the trend without being so on the nose
ladylike<00:01:55.369> so<00:01:55.670> instead<00:01:56.210> of<00:01:56.270> a<00:01:56.360> button-up<00:01:56.720> or<00:01:56.930> a

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 
ladylike so instead of a button-up or a

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:04.990 
ladylike so instead of a button-up or a
tweed<00:01:57.170> jacket<00:01:57.490> rhinestone<00:01:58.490> sandals<00:02:03.820> now<00:02:04.820> that

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
tweed jacket rhinestone sandals now that

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.240 
tweed jacket rhinestone sandals now that
we<00:02:05.090> have<00:02:05.240> our<00:02:05.479> templates<00:02:06.259> ready<00:02:06.619> it's<00:02:06.920> time<00:02:06.979> to

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
we have our templates ready it's time to

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.400 
we have our templates ready it's time to
start<00:02:07.400> gluing<00:02:07.550> but<00:02:08.119> first<00:02:08.420> make<00:02:08.989> sure<00:02:09.110> to<00:02:09.200> test

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
start gluing but first make sure to test

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:10.779 
start gluing but first make sure to test
out<00:02:09.560> your<00:02:09.709> glue<00:02:09.920> because<00:02:10.220> we<00:02:10.369> are<00:02:10.550> going<00:02:10.729> to

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
out your glue because we are going to

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.790 
out your glue because we are going to
apply<00:02:10.970> the<00:02:11.030> glue<00:02:11.120> directly<00:02:11.420> to<00:02:11.840> the<00:02:11.989> shoe<00:02:12.230> so

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
apply the glue directly to the shoe so

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.350 
apply the glue directly to the shoe so
if<00:02:12.860> it<00:02:12.920> comes<00:02:13.010> out<00:02:13.190> too<00:02:13.370> fast<00:02:13.640> or<00:02:13.820> too<00:02:13.850> slow<00:02:13.970> you

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
if it comes out too fast or too slow you

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.910 
if it comes out too fast or too slow you
want<00:02:14.510> to<00:02:14.600> know<00:02:14.720> kind<00:02:15.260> of<00:02:15.350> the<00:02:15.440> consistency

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
want to know kind of the consistency

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.770 
want to know kind of the consistency
before<00:02:16.190> you<00:02:16.489> go<00:02:16.580> right<00:02:16.790> into<00:02:16.940> it<00:02:17.060> another

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
before you go right into it another

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.120 
before you go right into it another
thing<00:02:17.989> is<00:02:18.080> to<00:02:18.110> start<00:02:18.440> from<00:02:18.530> the<00:02:18.650> center<00:02:18.920> of<00:02:19.040> the

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
thing is to start from the center of the

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.979 
thing is to start from the center of the
shoe<00:02:19.340> because<00:02:19.610> you're<00:02:20.510> gonna<00:02:20.600> have<00:02:20.720> to<00:02:20.810> hold

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
shoe because you're gonna have to hold

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:22.750 
shoe because you're gonna have to hold
the<00:02:21.140> rhinestones<00:02:21.620> on<00:02:21.800> the<00:02:21.890> sides<00:02:22.130> whereas<00:02:22.700> the

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
the rhinestones on the sides whereas the

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.520 
the rhinestones on the sides whereas the
ones<00:02:22.910> on<00:02:23.000> the<00:02:23.090> top<00:02:23.300> you<00:02:24.050> can<00:02:24.200> just<00:02:24.320> let<00:02:24.380> them

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
ones on the top you can just let them

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.770 
ones on the top you can just let them
sit<00:02:24.680> there<00:02:24.739> and<00:02:24.950> dry<00:02:25.190> first<00:02:26.180> one<00:02:26.450> always<00:02:26.600> the

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
sit there and dry first one always the

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:34.420 
sit there and dry first one always the
most<00:02:26.930> nerve-wracking<00:02:27.440> way<00:02:33.100> all<00:02:34.100> right<00:02:34.220> you

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
most nerve-wracking way all right you

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.900 
most nerve-wracking way all right you
got<00:02:34.550> one<00:02:34.580> on<00:02:34.730> I<00:02:39.070> prefer<00:02:40.070> using<00:02:40.250> my<00:02:40.459> hands<00:02:40.730> with

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
got one on I prefer using my hands with

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.250 
got one on I prefer using my hands with
this<00:02:41.090> but<00:02:41.360> some<00:02:41.540> people<00:02:41.750> also<00:02:41.840> like<00:02:42.050> to<00:02:42.230> use

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
this but some people also like to use

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.380 
this but some people also like to use
tweezers<00:02:42.590> if<00:02:43.489> you<00:02:43.610> really<00:02:43.850> shaky<00:02:44.239> that's

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
tweezers if you really shaky that's

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.759 
tweezers if you really shaky that's
always<00:02:44.540> a<00:02:44.630> good<00:02:44.780> idea<00:02:47.230> this<00:02:48.230> glue<00:02:48.470> is<00:02:48.500> like<00:02:48.739> a

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
always a good idea this glue is like a

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.069 
always a good idea this glue is like a
nail<00:02:49.040> polish<00:02:49.250> so<00:02:49.730> it<00:02:50.209> kind<00:02:50.360> of<00:02:50.390> dries<00:02:50.720> almost

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:51.079 
nail polish so it kind of dries almost

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:53.590 
nail polish so it kind of dries almost
instantly<00:02:51.320> but<00:02:52.070> it<00:02:52.850> doesn't<00:02:53.120> set<00:02:53.360> right<00:02:53.390> away

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
instantly but it doesn't set right away

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.330 
instantly but it doesn't set right away
so<00:02:53.870> you<00:02:54.170> have<00:02:54.260> to<00:02:54.410> wait<00:02:54.530> at<00:02:54.620> least<00:02:54.650> an<00:02:54.950> hour<00:02:55.160> I

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
so you have to wait at least an hour I

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.039 
so you have to wait at least an hour I
actually<00:02:55.610> rather<00:02:55.940> wait<00:02:56.180> overnight<00:02:56.510> to<00:02:56.900> wear

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:57.049 
actually rather wait overnight to wear

00:02:57.049 --> 00:02:59.339 
actually rather wait overnight to wear
