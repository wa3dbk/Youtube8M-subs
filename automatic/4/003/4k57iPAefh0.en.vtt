in<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.820> rod<00:01:12.030> holder<00:01:12.390> most<00:01:12.630> likely<00:01:13.080> so<00:01:13.320> so<00:01:14.189> be<00:01:14.340> it

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
in a rod holder most likely so so be it

and I'm selling one of these reels the
Abu<00:01:36.750> 7000<00:01:37.530> died<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:38.070> I<00:01:38.670> asked<00:01:39.659> him<00:01:39.810> if<00:01:39.840> he<00:01:40.110> was

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
Abu 7000 died and I asked him if he was

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.960 
Abu 7000 died and I asked him if he was
interested<00:01:40.590> in<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.759> he<00:01:42.450> was<00:01:42.689> but<00:01:43.729> he<00:01:44.729> said

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
interested in it and he was but he said

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.940 
interested in it and he was but he said
it<00:01:45.090> felt<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.450> little<00:01:45.720> bulky<00:01:46.110> compared<00:01:46.590> to<00:01:46.799> the

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
it felt a little bulky compared to the

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.550 
it felt a little bulky compared to the
other<00:01:47.100> reels<00:01:47.430> that<00:01:47.610> he<00:01:47.850> used<00:01:48.119> so<00:01:48.570> I<00:01:48.840> thought

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
other reels that he used so I thought

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.499 
other reels that he used so I thought
this<00:01:49.979> would<00:01:50.130> be<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.280> good<00:01:50.460> opportunity<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:51.329> put

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
this would be a good opportunity to put

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.870 
this would be a good opportunity to put
all<00:01:51.630> my<00:01:51.780> reels<00:01:52.049> together<00:01:52.500> take<00:01:53.490> a<00:01:53.520> little

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
all my reels together take a little

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.959 
all my reels together take a little
video<00:01:54.090> so<00:01:54.509> one<00:01:54.930> he<00:01:55.200> can<00:01:55.380> see<00:01:55.619> it<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:55.979> two

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
video so one he can see it and two

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.660
