when<00:01:46.730> you<00:01:46.820> first<00:01:47.030> start<00:01:47.270> learning<00:01:47.300> three<00:01:47.810> all

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
when you first start learning three all

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:49.870 
when you first start learning three all
you<00:01:48.440> do<00:01:48.590> is<00:01:48.710> put<00:01:48.920> the<00:01:49.040> two<00:01:49.220> hoops<00:01:49.490> in<00:01:49.760> your

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
you do is put the two hoops in your

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.630 
you do is put the two hoops in your
dominant<00:01:50.330> hand<00:01:50.360> to<00:01:50.840> start<00:01:51.200> and<00:01:51.500> then<00:01:52.310> you<00:01:52.430> just

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
dominant hand to start and then you just

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.050 
dominant hand to start and then you just
throw<00:01:52.700> right<00:01:53.540> left<00:01:53.900> right<00:01:54.460> throw<00:01:55.460> them<00:01:55.640> up<00:01:55.820> and

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
throw right left right throw them up and

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.410 
throw right left right throw them up and
catch<00:01:56.270> and<00:01:56.660> then<00:01:57.650> slowly<00:01:57.980> build<00:01:58.340> two<00:01:59.120> more<00:01:59.330> and

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
catch and then slowly build two more and

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.900 
catch and then slowly build two more and
more<00:01:59.600> catches<00:02:00.050> this<00:02:00.980> pattern<00:02:01.370> just<00:02:01.520> cycles

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:01.910 
more catches this pattern just cycles

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.580 
more catches this pattern just cycles
into<00:02:02.090> itself<00:02:02.570> so<00:02:02.750> you<00:02:02.840> can<00:02:02.990> just<00:02:03.140> continue

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
into itself so you can just continue

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.090 
into itself so you can just continue
doing<00:02:03.710> it<00:02:03.980> for<00:02:04.190> as<00:02:04.280> long<00:02:04.310> as<00:02:04.460> you<00:02:04.640> want<00:02:06.100> your

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
doing it for as long as you want your

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.889 
doing it for as long as you want your
goal<00:02:07.280> is<00:02:07.430> to<00:02:07.460> keep<00:02:07.790> each<00:02:08.000> thrown<00:02:08.390> hoop<00:02:08.690> a

all of the throws in this basic cascade

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.800
