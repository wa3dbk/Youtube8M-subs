00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
asparagus and hold it near the middle

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.370 
asparagus and hold it near the middle
and<00:02:10.820> the<00:02:10.940> base<00:02:11.120> apply<00:02:11.690> a<00:02:11.720> small<00:02:11.960> amount<00:02:12.140> of

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
and the base apply a small amount of

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.260 
and the base apply a small amount of
pressure<00:02:12.590> and<00:02:12.890> it'll<00:02:13.100> snap<00:02:13.400> naturally<00:02:14.090> where

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
pressure and it'll snap naturally where

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.030 
pressure and it'll snap naturally where
the<00:02:14.390> wood<00:02:14.570> ends<00:02:14.930> and<00:02:15.380> that<00:02:15.500> way<00:02:15.590> you<00:02:15.650> make<00:02:15.830> sure

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
the wood ends and that way you make sure

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.320 
the wood ends and that way you make sure
that<00:02:16.250> everything<00:02:16.550> you're<00:02:16.670> eating<00:02:16.970> is<00:02:17.120> just

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
we've done that the next step is to take

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.710 
we've done that the next step is to take
a<00:02:22.010> scoop<00:02:22.370> of<00:02:22.490> our<00:02:22.640> time<00:02:22.910> butter<00:02:23.180> a<00:02:23.270> little<00:02:23.480> bit

a scoop of our time butter a little bit

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.330 
a scoop of our time butter a little bit
has<00:02:23.810> been<00:02:23.840> held<00:02:24.200> out<00:02:24.380> then<00:02:24.860> we're<00:02:24.950> gonna<00:02:25.070> rub

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
has been held out then we're gonna rub

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.160 
has been held out then we're gonna rub
that<00:02:25.520> all<00:02:25.820> over<00:02:25.850> then<00:02:26.510> you<00:02:26.570> just<00:02:26.720> put<00:02:26.900> a<00:02:26.930> dollop

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
that all over then you just put a dollop

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.260 
that all over then you just put a dollop
on<00:02:27.380> top<00:02:27.650> move<00:02:28.220> it<00:02:28.340> around<00:02:28.400> on<00:02:28.670> your<00:02:28.850> board<00:02:29.060> and

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
on top move it around on your board and

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:30.880 
on top move it around on your board and
that<00:02:29.360> way<00:02:29.480> it<00:02:29.630> gives<00:02:29.750> all<00:02:30.080> nice<00:02:30.320> and<00:02:30.530> flavored

that way it gives all nice and flavored
and<00:02:31.730> now<00:02:31.880> I'm<00:02:32.000> just<00:02:32.120> going<00:02:32.210> to<00:02:32.330> place<00:02:32.600> the

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
and now I'm just going to place the

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.800 
and now I'm just going to place the
asparagus<00:02:33.200> on<00:02:33.530> the<00:02:33.560> grill<00:02:34.480> cross<00:02:35.480> pattern

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810

what I do is I push on my hand and it
should<00:03:32.720> feel<00:03:32.870> basically<00:03:33.410> like<00:03:33.590> the<00:03:33.620> muscle<00:03:34.040> in

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
should feel basically like the muscle in

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.370 
should feel basically like the muscle in
between<00:03:34.520> your<00:03:35.090> finger<00:03:35.450> and<00:03:35.660> the<00:03:35.810> main<00:03:35.989> knuckle

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 
there and it should have some give to it

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.850 
there and it should have some give to it
shouldn't<00:03:38.750> feel<00:03:38.870> hard<00:03:39.170> but<00:03:39.410> at<00:03:39.470> the<00:03:39.530> same<00:03:39.709> time

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
shouldn't feel hard but at the same time

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.260 
shouldn't feel hard but at the same time
it<00:03:40.070> shouldn't<00:03:40.340> just<00:03:40.370> squish<00:03:40.730> through<00:03:40.940> like<00:03:41.120> it

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:41.270 
it shouldn't just squish through like it

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:42.760 
it shouldn't just squish through like it
was<00:03:41.390> all<00:03:41.510> loose<00:03:41.720> pretty<00:03:42.260> similar<00:03:42.560> to<00:03:42.650> that

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:42.770 
was all loose pretty similar to that

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.100 
was all loose pretty similar to that
muscle<00:03:43.130> texture<00:03:43.630> it's<00:03:44.630> going<00:03:44.840> to<00:03:44.900> keep

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110
