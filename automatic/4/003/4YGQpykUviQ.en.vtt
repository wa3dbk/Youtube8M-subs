00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
points in midair to do so we've mapped

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.770

for<00:00:41.960> specialty<00:00:42.399> so<00:00:43.399> the<00:00:43.520> idea<00:00:43.760> is<00:00:43.850> simple<00:00:44.149> if

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
for specialty so the idea is simple if

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.299 
for specialty so the idea is simple if
there's<00:00:44.570> a<00:00:44.630> building<00:00:44.989> to<00:00:45.079> the<00:00:45.200> left<00:00:45.410> well<00:00:46.190> then

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
there's a building to the left well then

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:47.650 
there's a building to the left well then
it's<00:00:46.460> better<00:00:46.640> to<00:00:46.850> use<00:00:46.969> the<00:00:47.059> left<00:00:47.239> trigger<00:00:47.390> and

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
it's better to use the left trigger and

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.299 
it's better to use the left trigger and
if<00:00:47.930> there's<00:00:48.110> one<00:00:48.290> to<00:00:48.379> the<00:00:48.469> right<00:00:48.649> then<00:00:49.100> it's

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
if there's one to the right then it's

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:50.740 
if there's one to the right then it's
better<00:00:49.460> to<00:00:49.640> use<00:00:49.670> the<00:00:49.850> right<00:00:50.000> rope<00:00:50.210> and<00:00:50.510> if

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
better to use the right rope and if

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.180 
better to use the right rope and if
there's<00:00:50.930> no<00:00:51.050> building<00:00:51.379> around<00:00:51.649> or<00:00:51.800> nothing<00:00:52.100> to

there's no building around or nothing to

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.180 
there's no building around or nothing to
