00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.929
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.290
 more classes video for u2 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.910
 presented by bild.de I am the 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.630
 circle well and I'll show you today 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:22.500
 the necromancer is the necromancer himself 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.330
 simply maria the easy you carry his 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.490
 Special ability is in one 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.560
 He has this death coat to transform 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.109
 death coat gets the special 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.700
 crafts and do not lose give 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.469
 but I would say before we go 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.239
 continue to turn the slaughter 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:41.340
 let's take take a first look at the 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:44.010
 talent planner and we are now 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.440
 Called a talent tree disney co here 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.300
 and I have one in the korman itself 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.940
 stack years give that interesting 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.940
 the stack that you sign on the 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.000
 draws soil and thus triggered this 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.710
 an opponent must run through it 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.480
 and you only have a direct attack 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.439
 craft and that is the once 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.330
 Craft the second weapon to him 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.619
 have given two German falls 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.200
 with the documents times in the 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.090
 melee must have informed 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.350
 called two Germans a possibility 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.229
 to defend myself 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.570
 but I use a little less than one 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.150
 stab the sixth craft is the 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.150
 Fountain of the Blood I summon myself 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.830
 a well and that heals mine 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.369
 allied to myself in the 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.680
 closer environment once at the beginning 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:36.170
 and next to it, every second announced 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:39.180
 Certainly the seventh to ninth 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.310
 craft are the near the summoners 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.560
 since I have a command in the imtech 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.409
 I worked in the trebbiner 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.380
 skills brought to the next shared 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.930
 cover my needs in the fight 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.399
 against various enemies as elite 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.680
 ability I did not shape me 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.360
 got it has a very powerful shape 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.770
 in which I do not transform myself 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.310
 and he assigns special powers 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.740
 to get 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:05.430
 that was as far as the vest craft of the 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.020
 nekromanten for me personally and yes 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.220
 the first ten points at the 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.250
 I have the curses 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.130
 packed in the precision of the carver 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.610
 received critical strike 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.750
 I force gross relatively well and thus 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.370
 every now and then to live a little bit too 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:24.170
 can not be bad 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:25.280
 had set points in pvp vp 30 because 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.800
 me the masters 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.240
 it is the after crafts are 20 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.610
 percent charged faster 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.280
 Of course, one for all my servants 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.170
 great choice 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.690
 then I have the city mastery 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.980
 died crafts are 15 percent 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.980
 charged faster 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.570
 that applies to the whole stab craft 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.920
 also a good choice for 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.420
 close the deaths nova if one 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.170
 Servant dies he explodes in one 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:53.300
 giftwolke happens in pvp vp often times 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.430
 that he dies and thus is one 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.830
 a little extra not bad 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.170
 especially in the pvp the opponents 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:03.380
 have to think twice about whether they mean mine 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.270
 petz attack or not the next 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.630
 thirty point because I have the blood times 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:10.520
 went there I have the first 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.830
 live in the thirst for blood 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.140
 tapping will be more effective once 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.700
 I live somewhere ago fetch her 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.310
 I get much more alive 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.860
 back in the pvp coupe a great thing 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.530
 the second craft is usually that 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:27.020
 vampirism the next down and transfer 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.510
 is working on you with the 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.740
 craft in harmony and that is 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.720
 of course a great thing at the 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.190
 I serve all over and that 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.860
 the last one is foul-smelling 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:38.390
 devour the hat pull states 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.910
 So whenever I have a condition somewhere 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:44.030
 I have it every few seconds 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.440
 these are transferred to my things and 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.360
 So you have a worry-free 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.280
 live and I would say we know 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.110
 Consider the advantage of this 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.320
 position it is definitely one that I 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:56.209
 amount of living has 28,000 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.760
 It is currently a lot of wood 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:02.690
 the disadvantage of this skill again 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:05.180
 is it that I am relatively little right away 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:07.340
 I have my goal 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.470
 it's really slow with the opponents 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.910
 hurt over time effects and mine 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.310
 to destroy service 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:15.800
 It may take a while, but then 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.560
 the strong suction effects and high 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.209
 life is not a problem and all this 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.910
 otherwise I have to say is the 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.930
 necromancer very strong I had until now 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.030
 no one yet 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.520
 greek opponent found me in 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.870
 single could also be dangerous 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.180
 here the elementalist has no 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:34.840
 chance and he can do it at one 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.310
 just because his friend comes around the corner 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.320
 but even the thief is not for me 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.210
 problem i will send you then now 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:44.539
 my fear craft over here 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:46.610
 Jordan and then I came mine 

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:48.680
 remaining life still scores around the 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.660
 elementary meyer take care of the 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.750
 situation was not a problem now 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:56.660
 really for me i have to say in 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:59.630
 The Necromancer develops fighting groups 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.979
 a really strong momentum since he is not 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.780
 only there on the opponent pact but 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:04.930
 even the buffs hurt this and so on 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:07.160
 increase and thereby know mine 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.479
 allies switch and act as they do 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.289
 want and do a lot of harm 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:10.970
 cause 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:12.889
 and if I'm lucky they'll go 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:15.949
 still admonished me but me then 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:18.380
 the big life pulse is not really 

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:20.720
 disturbs her just as she does warrior by one 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:21.289
 can further allied on him 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.080
 shut down 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:25.550
 that was the necromancer i hope that has 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.580
 you like that creates that has you 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:32.770
 helped and see you at the 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.770
 next class video again then bite
