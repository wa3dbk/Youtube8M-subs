 photoshop 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:23.810
 today we will need an adjustment 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.359
 at the end of tonal adjustment of the image 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.039
 called chengdu in highlights in the version 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:30.439
 in Portuguese I could not say exactly 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:33.230
 What you're saying is leftover and bright 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.790
 do not play shadows anyway 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.950

 Let's go back here to our beloved 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.990
 photoshop here with it open has this 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.240
 Image very cool of this way and show 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.870
 ball and we will be applying the 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.550
 image in case is the medical effect is I already 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.380
 I was taking control here to vote 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:42.440
 the method with an image was 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.590
 originally and we will see that in image 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:48.740
 image fit and we will search here 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.720
 standards do not see 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.930
 so big it comes smaller it is not 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.090
 which disables show options as well 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.340
 possesses if you experience the use of 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.380
 tool with these two options and 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.180
 after experiencing alone with 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.909
 the three that faster and broader 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.830
 add two more controllers here 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:10.159
 To find two more here to 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:12.680
 highlights and enables the settings of 

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:13.940
 color correction and contrast adjustment of 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.769
 kind of silly, right? 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.269
 but basically if you try 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:18.230
 here you can already have results as well 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:19.450
 interesting 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.610
 I confess that 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.590
 I tried this tool. 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.800
 both because I can not get results 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.720
 so good every time that the attempt to 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.879
 any way this image is an example 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.840
 It works very happy Mexico here in 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:33.790
 choice of image 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.010
 However, it is worth remembering that , 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.780
 will be available for download right? 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.550
 so it's worth you 'll try 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.709
 this tool because it is very simple 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.810
 and at the same time when you get the 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.849
 result works fine 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.310
 basically you're acting in chelsea 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:50.950
 In the highlights move the top then 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.560
 For example, I will increase you here. 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.090
 notice the smell of its dark parts 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.549
 then note that as I move 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.819
 sees them everywhere 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:03.790
 dark shadows of the truck on it are 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:05.110
 being heavily influenced then I 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:06.940
 May I have a refill 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.849
 I'm going to leave more or less right here at 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.739
 value and highlights now that 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:13.180
 in case they are doubts, I 'm already 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.470
 here in the report which is 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.160
 interesting that as myself 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.130
 on here 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.049
 the sky stays with the touch much more 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.700
 vibrant more dramatic né 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:23.200
 I even decrease to facilitate the 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.380
 right view 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.510
 so look, let's just reveal that so the 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.639
 note more or less here for example 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.280
 I found these things here a little 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:34.660
 burst your view options show and will 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.370
 download a little here 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:40.030
 the hue even because as the image 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.650
 TB medium but is a bit cloudy and such 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.480
 so I think if I leave a color 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.000
 very intense does not look good so I go 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.370
 download here we make an adjustment as 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.660
 lowering here this intensity one 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.389
 bit of things right? 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:55.630
 So I'm going to give you an okay now I have the 

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:57.090
 control against zebu wrote before and 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.859
 after 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.310
 notice how quickly you got 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:04.599
 very interesting setting where the image 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.730
 post-application was much more 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:09.310
 interesting in my opinion the 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.530
 result was made pretty quickly to right 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.450
 you achieve other results in other 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.340
 Tools you have to do a make 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.410
 a slightly higher turn 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:19.959
 so it's worth it when you want the 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.940
 so touch more pull that contrast of 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.340
 a somewhat differentiated way and 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.919
 experience the tool is that it is the 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.810
 sheeran tool in beauty highlights 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:29.750
 so this is it I hope I have contributed 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.300
 with a 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.730
 cement if you liked the video 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.190
 I'll be very pleased if you 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:39.590
 losing a match is just a click away 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:42.140
 That's going to help us a lot, right? 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.030
 this quality criterion than those of 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:46.370
 analysis and reanalysis of YouTube and a 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.890
