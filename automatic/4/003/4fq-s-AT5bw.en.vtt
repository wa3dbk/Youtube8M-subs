00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
and what this flower is for is basically

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.700 
and what this flower is for is basically
to<00:01:02.370> make<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:03.210> egg<00:01:03.719> which<00:01:04.170> we're<00:01:04.320> going<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.500> use

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
to make the egg which we're going to use

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.850 
to make the egg which we're going to use
stick<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.580> fish<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.409> then<00:01:07.409> the

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
stick to the fish and then the

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.800 
stick to the fish and then the
breadcrumbs<00:01:08.430> are<00:01:08.820> gonna<00:01:09.090> stick<00:01:09.360> to<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.540> egg

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
breadcrumbs are gonna stick to the egg

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.030 
breadcrumbs are gonna stick to the egg
so<00:01:10.710> it's<00:01:10.860> kind<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.220> like<00:01:11.490> food<00:01:12.450> glue<00:01:12.780> if<00:01:13.740> that's

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
so it's kind of like food glue if that's

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.480 
so it's kind of like food glue if that's
a<00:01:14.189> real<00:01:14.820> way<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.000> putting<00:01:15.390> things<00:01:15.710> so<00:01:16.710> in<00:01:17.250> the

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
a real way of putting things so in the

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.840 
a real way of putting things so in the
flour

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
flour

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.670
