important<00:01:07.799> when<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.070> build<00:01:08.310> one<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.580> these<00:01:08.700> is

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
important when you build one of these is

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.609 
important when you build one of these is
to<00:01:09.060> have<00:01:09.210> wonderful<00:01:09.600> drainage<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.380> floor

to have wonderful drainage the floor

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.500 
to have wonderful drainage the floor
should<00:01:10.799> have<00:01:11.010> some<00:01:11.250> gravel<00:01:11.790> down<00:01:12.000> here<00:01:12.360> in

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
should have some gravel down here in

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.390 
should have some gravel down here in
this<00:01:12.840> particular<00:01:13.140> one<00:01:13.409> we<00:01:13.560> have<00:01:13.680> shelves<00:01:14.250> and

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
this particular one we have shelves and

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.830 
this particular one we have shelves and
also<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.780> have<00:01:16.369> greenhouse<00:01:17.369> plastic<00:01:18.119> up<00:01:18.600> here

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
also you have greenhouse plastic up here

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.899 
also you have greenhouse plastic up here
it's<00:01:19.170> two<00:01:19.409> pieces<00:01:19.890> with<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.100> little<00:01:20.400> bit<00:01:20.549> of<00:01:20.580> air

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
it's two pieces with a little bit of air

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.210 
it's two pieces with a little bit of air
in<00:01:21.180> between<00:01:21.600> which<00:01:21.930> allows<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.920> light<00:01:23.189> to

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
in between which allows the light to

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.850 
in between which allows the light to
filter<00:01:23.610> in<00:01:23.970> but<00:01:24.420> also<00:01:24.600> keeps<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.170> heat<00:01:25.380> in<00:01:25.650> as

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
filter in but also keeps the heat in as

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.679 
filter in but also keeps the heat in as
well<00:01:26.159> this<00:01:26.580> particular<00:01:27.060> homeowner<00:01:27.450> has<00:01:27.659> a

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
well this particular homeowner has a

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.020 
well this particular homeowner has a
light<00:01:28.020> which<00:01:28.290> she<00:01:28.500> leaves<00:01:28.710> on<00:01:28.950> all<00:01:29.220> winter<00:01:29.670> and

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
light which she leaves on all winter and

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.910 
light which she leaves on all winter and
that<00:01:30.329> adds<00:01:30.600> a<00:01:30.780> little<00:01:31.020> bit<00:01:31.140> of<00:01:31.229> heat<00:01:31.470> as<00:01:31.680> well

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
that adds a little bit of heat as well

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.950 
that adds a little bit of heat as well
there's<00:01:32.369> actually<00:01:32.520> two<00:01:32.970> cold<00:01:33.299> frames<00:01:33.600> on<00:01:33.810> this

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
there's actually two cold frames on this

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.929 
there's actually two cold frames on this
property<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.619> other<00:01:34.650> one<00:01:35.040> is<00:01:35.189> doable<00:01:35.520> you

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
property the other one is doable you

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.550 
property the other one is doable you
could<00:01:36.119> build<00:01:36.329> one<00:01:36.479> of<00:01:36.720> these<00:01:36.780> yourself<00:01:36.840> so

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
could build one of these yourself so

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.140 
could build one of these yourself so
we'll<00:01:37.740> go<00:01:37.799> take<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.009> look<00:01:38.220> at<00:01:38.310> that<00:01:38.460> this<00:01:38.850> is<00:01:39.030> the

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
we'll go take a look at that this is the

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.990 
we'll go take a look at that this is the
smaller<00:01:39.450> cold<00:01:39.810> frame<00:01:40.079> it's<00:01:40.350> four<00:01:40.950> feet<00:01:41.340> by

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
smaller cold frame it's four feet by

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.179 
smaller cold frame it's four feet by
eight<00:01:42.360> feet<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:42.990> it's<00:01:43.140> three<00:01:43.439> feet<00:01:43.680> deep<00:01:43.950> that

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
eight feet and it's three feet deep that

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.499 
eight feet and it's three feet deep that
might<00:01:44.399> be<00:01:44.520> a<00:01:44.549> little<00:01:44.729> deep<00:01:45.000> if<00:01:45.180> you<00:01:45.270> want<00:01:45.450> to

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
might be a little deep if you want to

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:46.819 
might be a little deep if you want to
grow<00:01:45.630> vegetables<00:01:46.110> because<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.439> vegetables

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
grow vegetables because the vegetables

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.289 
grow vegetables because the vegetables
would<00:01:46.950> have<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.280> go<00:01:47.369> up<00:01:47.490> towards<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:48.119> light

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
would have to go up towards the light

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.120 
would have to go up towards the light
you'd<00:01:48.540> want<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.869> soil<00:01:49.049> level<00:01:49.409> much<00:01:49.560> closer<00:01:49.890> to

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
you'd want the soil level much closer to

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.920 
you'd want the soil level much closer to
the<00:01:50.250> top<00:01:50.460> of<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.700> cold<00:01:50.909> frame<00:01:51.149> but<00:01:51.360> this

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
the top of the cold frame but this

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.300 
the top of the cold frame but this
particular<00:01:52.170> cold<00:01:52.710> frame<00:01:52.920> is<00:01:53.040> warm<00:01:53.250> for

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
particular cold frame is warm for

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.700 
particular cold frame is warm for
storage<00:01:53.880> we've<00:01:54.090> got<00:01:54.299> many<00:01:54.720> plants<00:01:55.290> in<00:01:55.380> here

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
storage we've got many plants in here

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.590 
storage we've got many plants in here
which<00:01:55.860> didn't<00:01:56.219> get<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:56.520> chance<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:57.000> get<00:01:57.090> planted

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
which didn't get a chance to get planted

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.109 
which didn't get a chance to get planted
last<00:01:57.780> year<00:01:58.200> or<00:01:58.380> will<00:01:58.619> be<00:01:58.829> planted<00:01:59.310> this<00:01:59.670> spring

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
last year or will be planted this spring

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.149 
last year or will be planted this spring
so<00:02:00.299> this<00:02:00.420> is<00:02:00.540> more<00:02:00.750> of<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.899> storage<00:02:01.320> cold<00:02:01.799> frame

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
so this is more of a storage cold frame

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.120 
so this is more of a storage cold frame
and<00:02:02.399> you<00:02:03.090> could<00:02:03.360> also<00:02:03.630> build<00:02:03.990> levels<00:02:04.560> inside

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
and you could also build levels inside

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.649 
and you could also build levels inside
of<00:02:05.340> this<00:02:05.490> so<00:02:05.640> you<00:02:05.729> could<00:02:05.850> have<00:02:05.969> one<00:02:06.000> area<00:02:06.420> where

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
of this so you could have one area where

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.210 
of this so you could have one area where
you're<00:02:06.840> growing<00:02:07.229> things<00:02:07.409> and<00:02:07.530> other<00:02:07.770> areas

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
you're growing things and other areas

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.589 
you're growing things and other areas
where<00:02:08.250> you're<00:02:08.520> storing<00:02:08.819> notice<00:02:09.300> this<00:02:09.450> some

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
where you're storing notice this some

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.999 
where you're storing notice this some
gravel<00:02:09.989> down<00:02:10.170> here<00:02:10.410> at<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.560> base<00:02:10.739> that's

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
gravel down here at the base that's

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.130 
gravel down here at the base that's
wonderful<00:02:11.550> for<00:02:11.730> drainage<00:02:12.180> I<00:02:12.360> recommend<00:02:12.989> that

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
wonderful for drainage I recommend that

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.670 
wonderful for drainage I recommend that
you<00:02:13.200> face

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
you face

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.589 
you face
this<00:02:13.920> off<00:02:14.129> towards<00:02:14.579> the<00:02:14.670> south<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:15.329> sun's

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
this off towards the south the sun's

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.509 
this off towards the south the sun's
right<00:02:15.900> there<00:02:16.230> that<00:02:16.620> will<00:02:16.799> enable<00:02:17.040> it<00:02:17.250> to<00:02:17.310> get

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
right there that will enable it to get

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.209 
right there that will enable it to get
the<00:02:17.640> most<00:02:17.790> sunshine<00:02:18.359> and<00:02:18.629> then<00:02:19.560> again<00:02:19.859> you<00:02:20.189> can

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:20.219 
the most sunshine and then again you can

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:22.069 
the most sunshine and then again you can
build<00:02:20.609> this<00:02:20.730> out<00:02:20.849> of<00:02:21.000> wood<00:02:21.180> or<00:02:21.359> if<00:02:21.810> you<00:02:21.959> don't

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:22.079 
build this out of wood or if you don't

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:23.599 
build this out of wood or if you don't
want<00:02:22.200> to<00:02:22.379> go<00:02:22.530> through<00:02:22.859> all<00:02:22.950> of<00:02:23.219> the

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:23.609 
want to go through all of the

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:25.369 
want to go through all of the
construction<00:02:24.090> yourself<00:02:24.810> you<00:02:25.049> can<00:02:25.200> actually

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379 
construction yourself you can actually

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:28.009 
construction yourself you can actually
order<00:02:25.769> a<00:02:26.129> cold<00:02:26.430> frame<00:02:26.640> online<00:02:27.180> just<00:02:27.719> measure

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
order a cold frame online just measure

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:29.750 
order a cold frame online just measure
an<00:02:28.230> area<00:02:28.500> be<00:02:29.099> sure<00:02:29.310> that<00:02:29.519> you<00:02:29.579> have<00:02:29.730> a

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
an area be sure that you have a

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.089 
an area be sure that you have a
well-drained<00:02:30.480> area<00:02:30.870> where<00:02:31.379> you<00:02:31.620> have<00:02:31.769> a<00:02:31.799> clear

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
well-drained area where you have a clear

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.280 
well-drained area where you have a clear
view<00:02:32.489> of<00:02:32.549> the<00:02:32.819> southern<00:02:33.000> sky<00:02:33.150> and<00:02:33.780> your<00:02:34.079> cold

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
view of the southern sky and your cold

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
view of the southern sky and your cold
frame<00:02:34.500> will<00:02:34.650> be<00:02:34.739> good<00:02:34.859> to<00:02:35.010> go

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
frame will be good to go

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.009 
frame will be good to go
so<00:02:35.459> cold<00:02:35.730> frames<00:02:36.000> are<00:02:36.150> a<00:02:36.180> great<00:02:36.359> way<00:02:36.510> to<00:02:36.540> extend

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
so cold frames are a great way to extend
