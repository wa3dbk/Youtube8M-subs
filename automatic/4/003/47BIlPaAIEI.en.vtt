 Hello everyone, I am not with you birds today 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.019
 tell you how to cook 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.090
 stuffed tomatoes 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.679
 for this we need naturally 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.550
 I have five tomatoes myself 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:20.160
 I have one blue bunch of green 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.000
 dill parsley and but very tasty if you 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.039
 take basil 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.150
 also, if you wish, you can take a small 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.650
 a piece of cheese first thing we cleaned 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.619
 the blue ones cut him small 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.989
 sprinkled with salt and leave on 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.350
 half an hour to get out of it all the bitterness a 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.770
 while we are doing tomatoes 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:42.510
 cut off the hat 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.809
 and cut out all the inside 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.280
 so here it should turn out 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.960
 the insides of a tomato if you are better from 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.570
 chops cut them finely 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.989
 drain some water add there finely 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.989
 chopped greens 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:02.170
 as well as grated cheese 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.670
 and also add blue but 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:10.490
 naturally remember to rinse them off 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:12.860
 salt and squeeze well mixes 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.049
 three wives you can plant or 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:18.230
 pepper mixture will also add what 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:20.150
 spices I personally I do not want to do 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:24.430
 We lay out our tomatoes on 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.430
 baking tray and start them 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.360
 cover them with lids 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.420
 pour some water on the bottom 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:38.670
 and send in the oven at 200 degrees 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:38.670
 for 15 20 minutes 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.930
 probably in 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.490
 same as I have a little filling I 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.810
 I recommend it to freeze you in 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.780
 next time when you could 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.940
 talk pasta fry it and fall 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.520
 with them 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.070
 these are the cute tomatoes here 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.960
 get them perfect as a side dish 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.120
 or as a separate dish of them 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.430
