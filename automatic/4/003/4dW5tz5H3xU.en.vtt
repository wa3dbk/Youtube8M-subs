00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
using the crease brush from makeup geek

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.799 
using the crease brush from makeup geek
to<00:00:46.379> apply<00:00:46.739> that<00:00:46.980> in<00:00:47.219> my<00:00:47.760> crease<00:00:48.090> you<00:00:48.510> can<00:00:48.660> see

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
to apply that in my crease you can see

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.990 
to apply that in my crease you can see
the<00:00:48.989> supplies<00:00:49.379> really<00:00:50.129> strongly<00:00:50.460> at<00:00:50.730> first

all<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.270> shadows<00:00:51.750> are<00:00:51.870> very<00:00:52.110> pigmented<00:00:52.620> so<00:00:53.250> it

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
all the shadows are very pigmented so it

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.920 
all the shadows are very pigmented so it
just<00:00:53.550> takes<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:53.850> lot<00:00:53.969> of<00:00:54.000> blending<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.600> get<00:00:54.780> the

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
just takes a lot of blending to get the

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.930 
just takes a lot of blending to get the
smooth<00:00:55.260> even<00:00:55.649> transition<00:00:56.460> that<00:00:56.550> you'll<00:00:56.670> see

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
smooth even transition that you'll see

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.319

on<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.329> other<00:00:57.510> eye<00:01:01.640> then<00:01:02.640> using<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.059> same

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
on the other eye then using that same

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.850 
on the other eye then using that same
brush<00:01:03.600> I'm<00:01:03.780> going<00:01:03.840> into<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.350> shade<00:01:04.559> blur

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
next it's time to add some depth to the

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.679 
next it's time to add some depth to the
outer<00:01:29.280> corner<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:30.000> do<00:01:30.119> that<00:01:30.270> I'm<00:01:30.479> using
