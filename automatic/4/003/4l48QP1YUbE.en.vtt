Victory XC line and a lot has changed

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.119 
Victory XC line and a lot has changed
since<00:00:40.460> the<00:00:41.460> last<00:00:41.670> model<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.590> since<00:00:43.590> just<00:00:43.950> the

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
since the last model and since just the

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.459 
since the last model and since just the
original<00:00:44.640> model<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.539> biggest<00:00:45.899> change<00:00:46.170> really

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
original model the biggest change really

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.450 
original model the biggest change really
being<00:00:46.829> everything<00:00:47.670> on<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.059> bottom<00:00:49.460> they've

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
being everything on the bottom they've

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.290 
being everything on the bottom they've
gone<00:00:50.969> from<00:00:51.390> in<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.800> past<00:00:52.949> using<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.520> 6

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
gone from in the past using a 6

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.950 
gone from in the past using a 6
spike<00:00:54.899> plate<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:56.100> using<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.760> 4<00:00:57.210> spike<00:00:57.600> plate

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
spike plate to using a 4 spike plate

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.799 
spike plate to using a 4 spike plate
which<00:00:58.859> resembles<00:00:59.460> something<00:00:59.850> closer<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.570> the

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
which resembles something closer to the

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.750 
which resembles something closer to the
matumbo<00:01:01.170> which<00:01:01.530> I'm<00:01:01.980> really<00:01:02.280> happy<00:01:02.460> about

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
matumbo which I'm really happy about

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.670 
matumbo which I'm really happy about
because<00:01:03.300> I<00:01:03.329> did<00:01:03.690> like<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.899> use<00:01:04.140> my<00:01:04.350> matumbo

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
because I did like to use my matumbo

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.149 
because I did like to use my matumbo
spur<00:01:05.010> cross<00:01:05.250> except<00:01:05.700> um<00:01:06.170> I<00:01:07.170> just<00:01:07.619> didn't<00:01:08.070> like

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
spur cross except um I just didn't like

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.700 
spur cross except um I just didn't like
the<00:01:08.220> amount<00:01:08.520> of<00:01:08.640> support<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:09.119> they<00:01:09.390> had<00:01:10.080> but

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
the amount of support that they had but

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.390 
the amount of support that they had but
in<00:01:10.920> these<00:01:12.229> these<00:01:13.229> have<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.470> lot<00:01:13.710> more<00:01:13.950> support

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
in these these have a lot more support

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.960 
in these these have a lot more support
if<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.640> can<00:01:14.880> see<00:01:15.060> that<00:01:16.549> more<00:01:17.549> throughout<00:01:17.790> the

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
if you can see that more throughout the

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.640 
if you can see that more throughout the
mid-foot<00:01:18.380> lot<00:01:19.380> in<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.590> heel<00:01:20.420> also<00:01:21.650> they

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
mid-foot lot in the heel also they

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.210 
mid-foot lot in the heel also they
switched<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.549> back<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:24.180> this<00:01:24.920> different<00:01:25.920> kind

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
switched the back to this different kind

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.929 
switched the back to this different kind
of<00:01:26.310> pattern<00:01:27.110> still<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.140> hard<00:01:28.470> rubber<00:01:28.740> but<00:01:29.579> this

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
of pattern still a hard rubber but this

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.420 
of pattern still a hard rubber but this
pattern<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:30.570> actually<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.500> same<00:01:31.740> pattern<00:01:32.250> or

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
pattern is actually the same pattern or

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.120 
pattern is actually the same pattern or
the<00:01:33.180> same<00:01:33.390> kind<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:33.900> design<00:01:34.229> that<00:01:34.259> is<00:01:34.619> used<00:01:34.920> on

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
the same kind of design that is used on

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.940 
the same kind of design that is used on

get into more of the just the specifics

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.649 
get into more of the just the specifics
of<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.350> shoe<00:01:55.530> they've<00:01:56.340> stayed<00:01:56.850> with<00:01:57.030> Flywire

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
of the shoe they've stayed with Flywire

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.880 
of the shoe they've stayed with Flywire
and<00:01:58.640> they<00:01:59.640> haven't<00:01:59.880> changed<00:02:00.259> much<00:02:01.259> as<00:02:01.530> far<00:02:01.770> as

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
and they haven't changed much as far as

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.160 
and they haven't changed much as far as
mesh<00:02:02.189> this<00:02:02.880> mesh<00:02:03.270> feels<00:02:03.540> different<00:02:03.960> than<00:02:04.049> the

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
mesh this mesh feels different than the

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.880 
mesh this mesh feels different than the
mesh<00:02:04.350> I<00:02:04.530> was<00:02:04.649> on<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.950> XC<00:02:05.549> twos<00:02:06.509> but<00:02:07.469> it's<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.710> lot

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
mesh I was on the XC twos but it's a lot

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.609 
mesh I was on the XC twos but it's a lot
harder<00:02:08.330> very<00:02:09.330> coarse<00:02:09.810> which<00:02:10.140> is<00:02:10.289> going<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.530> be

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
harder very coarse which is going to be

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.160 
harder very coarse which is going to be
nice<00:02:10.890> for<00:02:11.129> breathability<00:02:11.520> and<00:02:12.030> if<00:02:12.660> you<00:02:12.870> get<00:02:13.050> in

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
nice for breathability and if you get in

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.000 
nice for breathability and if you get in
one<00:02:13.410> of<00:02:13.440> those<00:02:13.620> wet<00:02:13.980> and<00:02:14.160> muddy<00:02:14.280> courses<00:02:14.879> um

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
one of those wet and muddy courses um

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.979 
one of those wet and muddy courses um
it's<00:02:17.010> going<00:02:17.220> to<00:02:17.310> dry<00:02:17.610> out<00:02:17.640> or<00:02:18.090> at<00:02:18.660> least<00:02:18.690> all

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
it's going to dry out or at least all

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.360 
it's going to dry out or at least all
the<00:02:19.110> water<00:02:19.319> will<00:02:19.530> come<00:02:19.709> out<00:02:19.800> of<00:02:19.950> your<00:02:20.099> shoe

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
the water will come out of your shoe

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.699 
the water will come out of your shoe
something<00:02:20.940> like<00:02:21.090> that<00:02:21.349> so<00:02:22.349> I'm<00:02:22.680> really

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
something like that so I'm really

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.880 
something like that so I'm really
excited<00:02:23.010> because<00:02:24.080> usually<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.440> mesh<00:02:25.650> in<00:02:25.800> the

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
excited because usually the mesh in the

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.790 
excited because usually the mesh in the
past<00:02:26.190> has<00:02:26.580> been<00:02:26.610> really<00:02:27.510> lightweight<00:02:27.780> but<00:02:28.379> not

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
past has been really lightweight but not

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.229

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
they've really got that a nice balance

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.580 
they've really got that a nice balance
of<00:02:35.239> getting<00:02:36.239> it<00:02:36.330> lightweight<00:02:36.599> but<00:02:37.560> also

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
of getting it lightweight but also

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.320 
of getting it lightweight but also
keeping<00:02:38.160> it<00:02:38.280> really<00:02:38.489> durable<00:02:38.879> and<00:02:39.209> um<00:02:41.330> yeah

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
but then they switch it over to the four
