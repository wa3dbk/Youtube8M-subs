00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:06.160
 why it becomes fashion among young Brazilians 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.549
 this movement 

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:10.799
 so many animals 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:12.290
 to six months 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.290
 AndrÃ© sent the profession of merchant to turn 

00:00:16.339 --> 00:00:19.460
 the referee called 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.679
 literally who gives the cards in the theft 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:25.029
 on the second day of school or were already talking 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:27.230
 You would say to our right. 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.850
 I'll keep this, but why invest in me? 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.970
 a course to work as a dealer in Brazil 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.730
 the answer lies in the success of poker among Brazilians I like it 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.870
 the letter until January 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.560
 the poster that gets to move billions of championships has transformed 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.060
 in a competitive market 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.710
 he was a forward player with this opportunity and opened a school for 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.970
 team up 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.790
 and now they are provisional 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.790
 professionalize the secretariat the game works like this 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.700
 each player has two knives in his hand 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.720
 5 stand as the 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.790
 during the rounds bets happen 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.620
 that equals money the point 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.940
 I intend to take those tracks who have the best combination of five matches to the 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.190
 end was the last player not to give up the hand 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.570
 but this type of game is not prohibited in Brazil 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.680
 poker players need to have good memory song viability to 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.979
 develop 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.399
 you try to win the matches this game is not considered of chance the 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:39.150
 saints is not illegal 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.010
 the santana 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:42.910
 all competitors start with the final prize 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:44.160
 anna karolina 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.990
 I also saw an opportunity in the cut created a clothing brand for players 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.000
 that supporters of the game 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.040
 you should also get heavy pick up and fashion supporters this was without 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.890
 pump detectors 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.890
 those who like the sport do not take their eyes off the poker championships 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.520
 started by the internet eduardo- who also plays a very bad impression that 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.080
 transmits the games on a website and today news to lusa 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:12.179
 streaming 

00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:15.339
 in the Brazilian championship of the SÃ£o Paulo championship 

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:18.419
 and asks for several greats from his son 

00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:19.529
 Brazil and even Brazil.
