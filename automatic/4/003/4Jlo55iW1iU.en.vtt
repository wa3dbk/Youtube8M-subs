 bring a fish for a short time 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.250
 this little afternoon is so here 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.159
 so for the editing that I used it 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.770
 today I could chic heineken so 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.140
 a simple assembly a very montage 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.340
 short with here a doerig 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.110
 here is a derrick on the small hook to 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.850
 carbon swelling really a beautiful 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.619
 hymn that is 10 cm because I'm going 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.049
 use a feeder method so with a 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.250
 plan feeder I was a plan figure of 40 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:47.070
 guards now that eelv and coated with 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:49.850
 of primed this stick mix and fun not a 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.650
 mixed media justice robin wood 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.390
 here I invented angles 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.700
 prune snow this is a little pop 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.160
 up in fact 18 mm from home so a 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.080
 rain a boil is here at the pineapple a 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.490
 white coat and that I did that's 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.640
 that I cut them and that's it in small 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.020
 cubes into small pieces like that 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.479
 history of reducing the move as one 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.370
 is even in late winter that the 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.360
 fish do not tend to feed themselves 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.820
 big bites 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.800
 so here I prefer to cut a small 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.470
 little licks 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:22.260
 and so here I was earlier 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.730
 used a yellow ladder that got nothing to me 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.350
 reported for the moment me what I 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.220
 I'm going to do it is that suddenly I put 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.910
 a white help 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:32.010
 we'll see what it's all about 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:46.620
 am going to throw the cane and I tell you in 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:47.730
 course and here I am super happy there 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.830
 after four hours of fishing and 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.000
 finally a fish I was soon to 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.530
 to leave again I was just going 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.450
 noted even haque year and it decided to 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.330
 shut up a little bit like since I was able to 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.340
 first of all, so here you are, a pretty little 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.750

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.209
 little world of which 4 to fatter is going 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.769

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.709

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.910
 fish that is fun because their 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.620

 there it is not super super show or 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.930
 still today it's late winter 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.610
 for environments there is sun 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.780
 but that's after four hours 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.170
 earned me the dice throw the shot 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.540
 to wait 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.970
 and here is a pretty little fish that has 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:30.690
 bitten so on a pop up

 put back some poles and she's going 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.900
 fall back into his element that's a little 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.900
 little arrogant 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:51.549
