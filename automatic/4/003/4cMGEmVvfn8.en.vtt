that's on the left I'm taking out a
small<00:01:57.280> piece<00:01:57.489> of<00:01:57.520> it<00:01:57.909> before<00:01:58.390> I<00:01:58.420> cross<00:01:58.750> it<00:01:58.959> over

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
small piece of it before I cross it over

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.619 
small piece of it before I cross it over
the<00:01:59.289> middle<00:01:59.579> so<00:02:00.579> it<00:02:00.729> really<00:02:00.939> is<00:02:01.209> the<00:02:01.390> same

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:01.629 
the middle so it really is the same

00:02:01.629 --> 00:02:03.630 
the middle so it really is the same
thing<00:02:01.959> you're<00:02:02.200> just<00:02:02.229> removing<00:02:02.829> a<00:02:03.250> piece<00:02:03.429> of

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
thing you're just removing a piece of

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.990 
thing you're just removing a piece of
hair<00:02:03.819> from<00:02:03.849> a<00:02:04.149> different<00:02:04.539> strand<00:02:04.929> and<00:02:06.000> again

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
hair from a different strand and again

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.419 
hair from a different strand and again
I'm<00:02:07.299> just<00:02:07.329> going<00:02:07.689> to<00:02:07.750> repeat<00:02:08.319> this<00:02:08.590> all<00:02:08.979> the

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
I'm just going to repeat this all the

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:16.660 
I'm just going to repeat this all the
way<00:02:09.579> over<00:02:10.030> to<00:02:10.479> the<00:02:10.750> ponytail

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.720 

if<00:02:17.480> you<00:02:17.750> run<00:02:18.020> out<00:02:18.200> of<00:02:18.230> hair<00:02:18.680> to<00:02:19.010> pull<00:02:19.550> out

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
if you run out of hair to pull out

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.730 
if you run out of hair to pull out
before<00:02:20.030> you<00:02:20.390> get<00:02:20.540> to<00:02:20.750> the<00:02:20.900> end<00:02:21.110> of<00:02:21.410> where<00:02:21.590> you

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
before you get to the end of where you

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.190 
before you get to the end of where you
need<00:02:21.890> to<00:02:22.040> be<00:02:22.069> you<00:02:22.580> can<00:02:22.760> just<00:02:22.970> add<00:02:23.209> a<00:02:23.240> regular

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
need to be you can just add a regular

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.110 
need to be you can just add a regular
braid<00:02:24.470> a<00:02:24.500> few<00:02:24.890> inches<00:02:25.069> it's<00:02:25.520> really<00:02:25.760> not<00:02:25.880> going

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
braid a few inches it's really not going

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.050 
braid a few inches it's really not going
to<00:02:26.240> make<00:02:26.360> a<00:02:26.390> huge<00:02:26.660> difference<00:02:27.520> so<00:02:28.520> again<00:02:28.850> I'm

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
to make a huge difference so again I'm

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.260 
to make a huge difference so again I'm
just<00:02:29.090> going<00:02:29.300> to<00:02:29.569> tie<00:02:29.870> this<00:02:29.930> off

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.490 

okay<00:02:34.270> now<00:02:34.420> that<00:02:34.630> I<00:02:34.660> have<00:02:34.960> both<00:02:35.200> of<00:02:35.230> those

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
okay now that I have both of those

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.350 
okay now that I have both of those
braids<00:02:35.890> done<00:02:36.160> I'm<00:02:36.490> going<00:02:36.700> to<00:02:36.820> take<00:02:37.000> this<00:02:37.120> one

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
braids done I'm going to take this one

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.840 
braids done I'm going to take this one
on<00:02:37.540> the<00:02:37.750> top<00:02:37.780> and<00:02:38.380> actually<00:02:38.830> add<00:02:39.040> it<00:02:39.250> into<00:02:39.490> this

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
on the top and actually add it into this

ponytail and to do that I'm just taking

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.130 
ponytail and to do that I'm just taking
a<00:02:43.420> tiny<00:02:43.750> elastic<00:02:45.660> just<00:02:46.660> putting<00:02:46.990> it<00:02:47.110> right

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
a tiny elastic just putting it right

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.430 
a tiny elastic just putting it right
over<00:02:47.560> the<00:02:47.680> top<00:02:48.210> now<00:02:49.210> for<00:02:49.540> the<00:02:49.630> fun<00:02:49.810> part<00:02:49.870> I'm

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
over the top now for the fun part I'm

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.080 
over the top now for the fun part I'm
going<00:02:50.620> to<00:02:50.710> take<00:02:51.010> these<00:02:51.190> strands<00:02:51.730> and<00:02:51.880> braid

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
going to take these strands and braid

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.910 
going to take these strands and braid
them<00:02:52.270> together<00:02:52.540> so<00:02:53.170> I'm<00:02:53.320> going<00:02:53.560> to<00:02:53.680> grab<00:02:53.890> one

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
them together so I'm going to grab one

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.980 
them together so I'm going to grab one
strand<00:02:54.580> here<00:02:54.910> from<00:02:55.180> the<00:02:55.300> braid<00:02:55.450> on<00:02:55.630> the<00:02:55.720> top

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
strand here from the braid on the top

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.190 
strand here from the braid on the top
and<00:02:56.380> two<00:02:56.440> from<00:02:57.340> the<00:02:57.400> bottom<00:02:57.840> for<00:02:58.840> the<00:02:58.930> three

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
and two from the bottom for the three

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.260 
and two from the bottom for the three
strands<00:02:59.740> and<00:02:59.950> I'm<00:03:00.010> just<00:03:00.220> going<00:03:00.430> to<00:03:00.490> begin<00:03:00.760> a

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
strands and I'm just going to begin a

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.140 
strands and I'm just going to begin a
regular<00:03:01.510> braid<00:03:02.110> and<00:03:02.380> then<00:03:03.310> as<00:03:03.550> I'm<00:03:03.880> coming

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
regular braid and then as I'm coming

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.480 
regular braid and then as I'm coming
across<00:03:04.540> I'm<00:03:05.050> going<00:03:05.320> to<00:03:05.410> be<00:03:05.530> adding<00:03:05.920> in<00:03:06.160> a

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.490 
across I'm going to be adding in a

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.490 
across I'm going to be adding in a
strand<00:03:07.030> from<00:03:07.210> the<00:03:07.300> top<00:03:07.630> and<00:03:07.930> the<00:03:07.990> bottom<00:03:08.110> each

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
strand from the top and the bottom each

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.930 
strand from the top and the bottom each
time<00:03:10.350> so<00:03:11.350> this<00:03:11.500> is<00:03:11.560> basically<00:03:12.130> like<00:03:12.250> a<00:03:12.520> French

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
time so this is basically like a French

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:19.149 
time so this is basically like a French
braid<00:03:13.210> you're<00:03:13.570> just<00:03:13.750> using<00:03:13.980> tiny<00:03:14.980> strands

00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:19.159 

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:22.250 

and<00:03:20.159> I'm<00:03:20.249> trying<00:03:20.609> to<00:03:20.670> keep<00:03:20.939> this<00:03:21.120> braid<00:03:21.480> pretty

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
and I'm trying to keep this braid pretty

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.660 
and I'm trying to keep this braid pretty
much<00:03:22.469> in<00:03:22.739> the<00:03:22.950> middle<00:03:25.069> just<00:03:26.069> so<00:03:26.280> that<00:03:26.459> there's

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
much in the middle just so that there's

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.879 
much in the middle just so that there's
an<00:03:26.849> even<00:03:27.209> amount<00:03:27.329> of<00:03:27.629> space<00:03:27.959> on<00:03:28.319> each<00:03:28.530> side<00:03:28.859> of

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:28.889 
an even amount of space on each side of

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:32.700 
an even amount of space on each side of
it

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:32.710 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:35.920 

unless<00:03:33.710> you<00:03:34.010> actually<00:03:34.610> counted<00:03:35.300> the<00:03:35.480> strands

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
unless you actually counted the strands

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.960 
unless you actually counted the strands
that<00:03:36.080> you<00:03:36.170> are<00:03:36.290> taking<00:03:36.680> out<00:03:36.890> each<00:03:37.280> time<00:03:37.670> you're

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
that you are taking out each time you're

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:39.700 
that you are taking out each time you're
probably<00:03:38.150> going<00:03:38.480> to<00:03:38.570> end<00:03:38.810> up<00:03:38.960> with<00:03:39.140> an<00:03:39.260> uneven

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:39.710 
probably going to end up with an uneven

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:42.250 
probably going to end up with an uneven
amount<00:03:40.030> meaning<00:03:41.030> that<00:03:41.270> I'll<00:03:41.420> probably<00:03:41.660> run

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
amount meaning that I'll probably run

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.140 
amount meaning that I'll probably run
out<00:03:42.290> of<00:03:42.620> strands<00:03:42.950> either<00:03:43.250> on<00:03:43.520> the<00:03:43.640> top<00:03:43.880> or<00:03:43.910> the

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
out of strands either on the top or the

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.120 
out of strands either on the top or the
bottom<00:03:44.270> before<00:03:44.990> I<00:03:45.200> get<00:03:45.470> to<00:03:45.650> the<00:03:45.740> end<00:03:45.860> of<00:03:45.980> this

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
bottom before I get to the end of this

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.090 
bottom before I get to the end of this
braid<00:03:46.430> if<00:03:46.880> that<00:03:47.720> is<00:03:47.900> the<00:03:48.020> case<00:03:48.260> just<00:03:48.890> keep

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
braid if that is the case just keep

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.800 
braid if that is the case just keep
braiding<00:03:49.430> in<00:03:49.730> the<00:03:49.850> strands<00:03:50.240> you<00:03:50.330> have<00:03:50.540> left

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
braiding in the strands you have left

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:56.280 
braiding in the strands you have left
it's<00:03:51.200> really<00:03:51.500> not<00:03:51.620> going<00:03:51.890> to<00:03:51.950> be<00:03:52.040> noticeable

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.649 

so<00:03:57.099> now<00:03:57.250> that<00:03:57.310> I've<00:03:57.519> added<00:03:57.760> in<00:03:58.060> all<00:03:58.269> of<00:03:58.450> these

00:03:58.649 --> 00:03:58.659 
so now that I've added in all of these

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:00.990 
so now that I've added in all of these
strands<00:03:59.290> for<00:03:59.470> this<00:03:59.620> last<00:03:59.890> piece<00:04:00.310> I'm<00:04:00.640> going<00:04:00.879> to

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
strands for this last piece I'm going to

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:08.729 
strands for this last piece I'm going to
bring<00:04:01.390> in<00:04:01.540> this<00:04:01.659> entire<00:04:02.110> braid<00:04:06.060> and<00:04:07.590> then<00:04:08.590> I'm

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
bring in this entire braid and then I'm

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:10.979 
bring in this entire braid and then I'm
just<00:04:08.769> going<00:04:09.129> to<00:04:09.189> take<00:04:09.730> this<00:04:10.030> and<00:04:10.420> kind<00:04:10.629> of<00:04:10.720> wrap

just going to take this and kind of wrap
it<00:04:11.019> around<00:04:11.260> the<00:04:11.620> top<00:04:11.829> of<00:04:11.860> there<00:04:12.250> and<00:04:12.549> tie<00:04:12.849> it

00:04:12.899 --> 00:04:12.909 
it around the top of there and tie it

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:15.870 
it around the top of there and tie it
off

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.660 

and<00:04:16.150> I'm<00:04:16.690> going<00:04:16.959> to<00:04:17.020> be<00:04:17.230> making<00:04:17.860> a<00:04:18.130> fishtail

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:18.670 
and I'm going to be making a fishtail

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.410 
and I'm going to be making a fishtail
braid<00:04:18.730> so<00:04:19.570> I'm<00:04:19.690> splitting<00:04:20.200> this<00:04:20.380> in<00:04:20.590> half<00:04:21.420> I'm

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:22.420 
braid so I'm splitting this in half I'm

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.440 
braid so I'm splitting this in half I'm
taking<00:04:22.840> a<00:04:22.900> small<00:04:23.170> strand<00:04:23.530> from<00:04:24.010> the<00:04:24.490> right

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
taking a small strand from the right

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.480 
taking a small strand from the right
piece<00:04:25.900> and<00:04:26.260> I'm<00:04:26.350> crossing<00:04:26.530> it<00:04:26.830> over<00:04:26.980> to<00:04:27.340> the

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
piece and I'm crossing it over to the

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.180 
piece and I'm crossing it over to the
left<00:04:27.760> and<00:04:28.120> then<00:04:28.900> I'm<00:04:29.020> taking<00:04:29.230> a<00:04:29.500> small<00:04:29.800> strand

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:30.190 
left and then I'm taking a small strand

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.280 
left and then I'm taking a small strand
from<00:04:30.400> the<00:04:30.520> outside<00:04:31.060> at<00:04:31.330> the<00:04:31.480> left<00:04:31.750> and<00:04:32.200> I'm

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.290 
from the outside at the left and I'm

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:34.980 
from the outside at the left and I'm
crossing<00:04:32.530> it<00:04:32.800> over<00:04:33.070> to<00:04:33.250> the<00:04:33.370> right<00:04:33.610> and<00:04:34.270> I<00:04:34.810> am

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
crossing it over to the right and I am

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:36.930 
crossing it over to the right and I am
just<00:04:35.170> going<00:04:35.350> to<00:04:35.560> repeat<00:04:35.920> that<00:04:35.980> all<00:04:36.490> the<00:04:36.760> way<00:04:36.880> to

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
just going to repeat that all the way to

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.800 
just going to repeat that all the way to
the<00:04:37.210> bottom<00:04:37.390> you<00:04:39.450> really<00:04:40.450> don't<00:04:40.630> need<00:04:40.750> to

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
the bottom you really don't need to

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:42.450 
the bottom you really don't need to
worry<00:04:41.140> about<00:04:41.200> what<00:04:41.620> it<00:04:41.710> looks<00:04:41.890> like<00:04:42.070> you're<00:04:42.310> on

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
worry about what it looks like you're on

worry about what it looks like you're on
top<00:04:42.640> we're<00:04:43.210> going<00:04:43.390> to<00:04:43.480> be<00:04:43.600> covering<00:04:43.840> that<00:04:44.170> up

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:46.890 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.320 

alright<00:04:47.890> I've<00:04:48.070> made<00:04:48.280> a<00:04:48.310> fishtail<00:04:48.820> braid<00:04:48.880> and

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
alright I've made a fishtail braid and

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:50.940 
alright I've made a fishtail braid and
I've<00:04:49.420> tied<00:04:49.690> it<00:04:49.810> off<00:04:49.930> here<00:04:50.170> at<00:04:50.230> the<00:04:50.290> bottom<00:04:50.680> I'm

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
I've tied it off here at the bottom I'm

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.790 
I've tied it off here at the bottom I'm
going<00:04:51.280> to<00:04:51.370> take<00:04:51.640> this<00:04:51.850> elastic<00:04:52.600> wrap<00:04:53.590> it

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:53.800 
going to take this elastic wrap it

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.010 
going to take this elastic wrap it
around<00:04:53.890> one<00:04:54.310> more<00:04:54.490> time<00:04:54.550> and<00:04:55.300> not<00:04:55.540> pull<00:04:55.870> the

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
around one more time and not pull the

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.020 
around one more time and not pull the
ends<00:04:56.380> all<00:04:56.560> the<00:04:56.680> way<00:04:56.800> through<00:04:57.160> so<00:04:57.550> I'm<00:04:57.700> leaving

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
ends all the way through so I'm leaving

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.450 
ends all the way through so I'm leaving
a<00:04:58.120> little<00:04:58.240> loop<00:04:58.600> out<00:04:58.840> like<00:04:59.080> that<00:04:59.320> so<00:05:00.160> now<00:05:00.310> I'm

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
a little loop out like that so now I'm

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.970 
a little loop out like that so now I'm
going<00:05:00.640> to<00:05:00.730> take<00:05:01.000> this<00:05:01.150> and<00:05:01.390> fold<00:05:02.110> it<00:05:02.290> over<00:05:02.530> and

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:02.980 
going to take this and fold it over and

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:09.690 
going to take this and fold it over and
start<00:05:03.880> rolling<00:05:04.630> this<00:05:04.810> braid<00:05:05.200> up<00:05:08.700> basically

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:09.700 
start rolling this braid up basically

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.590 
start rolling this braid up basically
like<00:05:09.880> a<00:05:09.910> little<00:05:10.270> seashell<00:05:11.070> and<00:05:12.480> then<00:05:13.480> I'm

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:13.600 
like a little seashell and then I'm

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.100 
like a little seashell and then I'm
going<00:05:13.840> to<00:05:13.930> pin<00:05:14.260> it<00:05:14.380> into<00:05:14.530> place<00:05:15.690> I'm<00:05:16.690> just

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
going to pin it into place I'm just

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:26.370 
going to pin it into place I'm just
pinning<00:05:17.410> along<00:05:17.920> the<00:05:18.100> outside<00:05:18.640> edge<00:05:18.940> and<00:05:25.380> then

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:26.380 
pinning along the outside edge and then

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.800 
pinning along the outside edge and then
since<00:05:26.710> her<00:05:26.860> hair<00:05:27.100> is<00:05:27.310> on<00:05:27.580> the<00:05:27.760> longer<00:05:28.150> side<00:05:28.180> I

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810 
since her hair is on the longer side I

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.540 
since her hair is on the longer side I
don't<00:05:28.870> want<00:05:29.140> the<00:05:29.290> middle<00:05:29.590> of<00:05:29.710> this<00:05:29.890> to<00:05:30.070> pop<00:05:30.280> out

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550 
don't want the middle of this to pop out

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:33.060 
don't want the middle of this to pop out
so<00:05:31.420> I'm<00:05:31.540> adding<00:05:31.750> another<00:05:32.320> bobby<00:05:32.560> pin<00:05:32.680> right
