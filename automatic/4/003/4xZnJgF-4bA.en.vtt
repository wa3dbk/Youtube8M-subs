00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
so I'm really amazed by the results and

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.150 
so I'm really amazed by the results and
I<00:05:29.300> have<00:05:29.449> a<00:05:29.479> slight<00:05:29.750> bit<00:05:29.930> of<00:05:30.050> bruising<00:05:30.500> here<00:05:30.889> and

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160 
I have a slight bit of bruising here and

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.830 
I have a slight bit of bruising here and
I<00:05:32.090> think<00:05:32.330> that's<00:05:32.539> is<00:05:32.750> what<00:05:33.970> the<00:05:34.970> thickness<00:05:35.720> has

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.710 
I think that's is what the thickness has
got<00:05:36.110> him<00:05:36.919> all<00:05:37.789> the<00:05:37.880> sides<00:05:38.180> and<00:05:38.270> that<00:05:38.360> it<00:05:38.539> feels

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:38.720 
got him all the sides and that it feels

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.839 
got him all the sides and that it feels
absolutely<00:05:38.960> fine<00:05:39.650> and<00:05:39.889> I<00:05:40.310> will<00:05:40.430> be<00:05:40.550> taking

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:40.849
