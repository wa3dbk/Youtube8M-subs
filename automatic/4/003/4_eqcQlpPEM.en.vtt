making Chipotle steak quesadillas now as

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.880 
making Chipotle steak quesadillas now as
far<00:00:57.120> as<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.390> ratios<00:00:57.840> of<00:00:57.960> marinade<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.559> meat<00:00:58.739> I

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
far as the ratios of marinade to meat I

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.680 
far as the ratios of marinade to meat I
used<00:00:59.100> about<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.399> quarter<00:00:59.789> cup<00:00:59.820> to<00:01:00.149> every<00:01:00.449> pound

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
used about a quarter cup to every pound

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.450 
used about a quarter cup to every pound
of<00:01:00.899> meat<00:01:01.109> but<00:01:01.320> you<00:01:01.469> can<00:01:01.649> certainly<00:01:01.980> use<00:01:02.039> about

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
of meat but you can certainly use about

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.200 
of meat but you can certainly use about
1/3<00:01:02.609> cup<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.420> every<00:01:03.719> pound<00:01:03.960> of<00:01:04.140> meat<00:01:04.970> now<00:01:05.970> what

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
1/3 cup to every pound of meat now what

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.940 
1/3 cup to every pound of meat now what
we<00:01:06.299> want<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.570> do<00:01:06.689> is<00:01:06.840> go<00:01:07.020> ahead<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.470> season<00:01:07.680> the

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
we want to do is go ahead and season the

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.830 
we want to do is go ahead and season the
meat<00:01:08.130> with<00:01:08.430> kosher<00:01:08.670> salt<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.270> Grand<00:01:09.450> Diamond

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
meat with kosher salt and Grand Diamond

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.190 
meat with kosher salt and Grand Diamond
seasoning<00:01:10.260> on<00:01:10.380> both<00:01:10.680> sides<00:01:11.840> the<00:01:12.840> reason<00:01:13.140> I

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
seasoning on both sides the reason I

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.929 
seasoning on both sides the reason I
held<00:01:13.439> back<00:01:13.500> on<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.920> seasoning<00:01:14.369> was<00:01:14.400> because<00:01:14.909> I

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
held back on the seasoning was because I

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.940 
held back on the seasoning was because I
knew<00:01:15.420> I<00:01:15.450> was<00:01:15.780> going<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.110> marinate<00:01:16.530> this<00:01:16.710> meat

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
knew I was going to marinate this meat

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.950 
knew I was going to marinate this meat
for<00:01:17.159> eight<00:01:17.369> hours<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.970> what<00:01:18.150> salt<00:01:18.450> tends<00:01:18.780> to

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
for eight hours and what salt tends to

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.170 
for eight hours and what salt tends to
do<00:01:19.140> is<00:01:19.320> draw<00:01:19.560> moisture<00:01:19.830> out<00:01:20.280> of<00:01:20.430> meat<00:01:20.640> so

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
do is draw moisture out of meat so

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.969 
do is draw moisture out of meat so
that's<00:01:21.390> why<00:01:21.509> I<00:01:21.540> held<00:01:21.810> back<00:01:21.869> on<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.530> seasoning

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
that's why I held back on the seasoning

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.350 
that's why I held back on the seasoning
so<00:01:23.159> of<00:01:23.280> course<00:01:23.490> when<00:01:23.700> it<00:01:23.820> comes<00:01:24.000> out<00:01:24.180> of<00:01:24.299> the

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
so of course when it comes out of the

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.700 
so of course when it comes out of the
marinade<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:24.960> want<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.229> season<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:25.680> really

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
marinade you want to season it really

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:26.510 
marinade you want to season it really

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650

granulated<00:02:07.849> garlic<00:02:07.879> instead<00:02:08.360> of<00:02:08.569> fresh<00:02:08.780> is

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:08.959 
granulated garlic instead of fresh is

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:10.509 
granulated garlic instead of fresh is
because<00:02:09.259> I'm<00:02:09.410> going<00:02:09.560> to<00:02:09.619> put<00:02:09.829> these<00:02:10.009> peppers

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:10.519 
because I'm going to put these peppers

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:12.369 
because I'm going to put these peppers
and<00:02:10.700> onions<00:02:10.970> directly<00:02:11.690> on<00:02:11.810> the<00:02:11.959> grill<00:02:12.170> and<00:02:12.319> I

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:12.379 
and onions directly on the grill and I

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:14.050 
and onions directly on the grill and I
don't<00:02:12.590> want<00:02:12.829> the<00:02:12.950> garlic<00:02:13.190> to<00:02:13.430> burn<00:02:13.670> and<00:02:13.970> get

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
bitter before they're done cooking so I

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.160 
bitter before they're done cooking so I
opted<00:02:16.849> to<00:02:16.910> go<00:02:17.180> ahead<00:02:17.480> with<00:02:17.660> the<00:02:17.750> granulated

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.140 
opted to go ahead with the granulated
garlic<00:02:18.349> if<00:02:18.829> you<00:02:19.099> use<00:02:19.340> fresh<00:02:19.519> garlic<00:02:19.849> you're

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150

going to have to add it about Midway's
the<00:02:22.129> cooking<00:02:22.430> process<00:02:22.579> so<00:02:22.910> it<00:02:23.150> doesn't<00:02:23.420> burn

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
the cooking process so it doesn't burn

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.240 

if<00:03:12.900> you<00:03:13.110> notice<00:03:13.410> I'm<00:03:13.560> trying<00:03:13.800> to<00:03:13.950> place

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
if you notice I'm trying to place

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.010 
if you notice I'm trying to place
everything<00:03:14.580> strategically<00:03:15.420> that's<00:03:15.630> because

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
everything strategically that's because

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.840 
everything strategically that's because
when<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:16.350> cheese<00:03:16.620> melt<00:03:16.920> I<00:03:17.100> want<00:03:17.400> to<00:03:17.490> give<00:03:17.640> it<00:03:17.760> a

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
when the cheese melt I want to give it a

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.610 
when the cheese melt I want to give it a
border<00:03:18.210> around<00:03:18.510> the<00:03:18.780> edge<00:03:18.810> of<00:03:18.960> the<00:03:19.140> tortilla

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
border around the edge of the tortilla

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.830 
border around the edge of the tortilla
so<00:03:20.250> that<00:03:20.400> it's<00:03:20.580> still<00:03:20.940> within<00:03:21.210> the<00:03:21.420> tortilla

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
so that it's still within the tortilla

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.110 
so that it's still within the tortilla
and<00:03:21.900> it<00:03:22.170> doesn't<00:03:22.530> ooze<00:03:22.710> out<00:03:23.010> so<00:03:23.610> leave<00:03:23.850> about<00:03:24.060> a

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
and it doesn't ooze out so leave about a

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.880 
and it doesn't ooze out so leave about a
half<00:03:24.450> inch<00:03:24.690> maybe<00:03:24.960> three<00:03:25.320> quarters<00:03:25.350> of<00:03:25.770> an

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
half inch maybe three quarters of an

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.940 
half inch maybe three quarters of an
inch<00:03:26.010> around<00:03:26.520> the<00:03:26.850> tortilla<00:03:27.330> border<00:03:28.260> so<00:03:28.770> that

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
inch around the tortilla border so that

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.190 
inch around the tortilla border so that
the<00:03:29.070> cheese<00:03:29.220> will<00:03:29.400> have<00:03:29.520> room<00:03:29.760> to<00:03:29.940> milk<00:03:33.200> okay

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
the cheese will have room to milk okay
