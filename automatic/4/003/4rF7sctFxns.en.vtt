screw holes and bolt and in that way
you'll<00:01:24.630> end<00:01:25.170> up<00:01:25.259> having<00:01:25.679> rear<00:01:26.159> wheel<00:01:26.340> drive

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
you'll end up having rear wheel drive

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.830 
you'll end up having rear wheel drive
instead<00:01:27.179> of<00:01:27.299> just<00:01:27.539> a<00:01:27.689> front<00:01:27.899> wheel<00:01:28.049> drive

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840

another quick change what I've done is

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.639 
another quick change what I've done is
remove<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:34.219> heatsink<00:01:35.219> controller<00:01:35.999> here

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
remove the heatsink controller here

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:39.020 
remove the heatsink controller here
which<00:01:37.649> is<00:01:37.859> normally<00:01:38.280> placed<00:01:38.579> on<00:01:38.789> the<00:01:38.909> other

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
which is normally placed on the other

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.419 
which is normally placed on the other
side<00:01:39.329> of<00:01:39.359> the<00:01:39.539> truck<00:01:39.780> out<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.109> the<00:01:40.319> box<00:01:40.560> which

00:01:41.419 --> 00:01:41.429 
side of the truck out of the box which

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:43.370 
side of the truck out of the box which
sits<00:01:42.149> on<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.420> side<00:01:42.630> of<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.840> motor<00:01:43.020> and

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
sits on the side of the motor and

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.090 
sits on the side of the motor and
gearbox<00:01:43.799> area<00:01:44.460> I<00:01:45.240> was<00:01:45.780> finding<00:01:46.049> that<00:01:46.289> the<00:01:46.590> this

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
gearbox area I was finding that the this

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.669 
gearbox area I was finding that the this
was<00:01:47.280> getting<00:01:47.549> a<00:01:47.609> bit<00:01:47.789> hot<00:01:47.969> but<00:01:48.179> also<00:01:48.679> driving

00:01:49.669 --> 00:01:49.679 
was getting a bit hot but also driving

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:52.459 
was getting a bit hot but also driving
through<00:01:50.009> water<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.670> moisture<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:52.049> so<00:01:52.229> on

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:52.469 
through water and moisture and so on

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:55.160 
through water and moisture and so on
could<00:01:52.709> damage<00:01:52.950> it<00:01:53.159> so<00:01:53.490> I<00:01:53.520> relocated<00:01:54.179> up<00:01:54.899> to

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
could damage it so I relocated up to

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.370 
could damage it so I relocated up to
this<00:01:55.289> area<00:01:55.999> just<00:01:57.139> readjusted<00:01:58.139> all<00:01:58.289> the

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
this area just readjusted all the

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.309 
this area just readjusted all the
cabling<00:01:58.770> as<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.130> can<00:01:59.219> see<00:01:59.749> and<00:02:00.749> double-sided

00:02:01.309 --> 00:02:01.319 
cabling as you can see and double-sided

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:03.230 
cabling as you can see and double-sided
taped<00:02:01.979> it<00:02:02.130> there<00:02:02.340> with<00:02:02.759> a<00:02:02.789> little<00:02:03.029> bit<00:02:03.179> of

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
taped it there with a little bit of

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.609 
taped it there with a little bit of
silicon<00:02:03.689> around<00:02:03.959> it<00:02:04.109> to<00:02:04.229> help<00:02:04.409> with<00:02:04.590> the

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
silicon around it to help with the

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:10.620 
silicon around it to help with the
moisture

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.410 

so<00:02:10.750> one<00:02:10.930> of<00:02:10.960> the<00:02:11.230> mods<00:02:11.950> that<00:02:12.070> are<00:02:12.250> put<00:02:12.430> on<00:02:12.580> is<00:02:12.790> is

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
so one of the mods that are put on is is

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.870 
so one of the mods that are put on is is
the<00:02:13.750> winch<00:02:13.960> this<00:02:14.800> is<00:02:14.950> a<00:02:14.980> bulldog<00:02:15.430> winch<00:02:15.640> off

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
the winch this is a bulldog winch off

area they do state that this motor is
not<00:03:19.690> waterproof<00:03:19.900> so<00:03:20.500> I<00:03:20.800> wouldn't<00:03:21.250> submerge<00:03:21.610> it

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
not waterproof so I wouldn't submerge it

to<00:03:37.300> keep<00:03:37.540> it<00:03:37.690> waterproof<00:03:38.080> I<00:03:39.330> then<00:03:40.440> found<00:03:41.440> an

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
to keep it waterproof I then found an

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.630 
to keep it waterproof I then found an
old<00:03:41.709> battery<00:03:42.600> cable<00:03:43.600> that<00:03:44.110> i<00:03:44.140> had<00:03:44.550> think<00:03:45.550> it

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
old battery cable that i had think it

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.600 
old battery cable that i had think it
was<00:03:45.730> for<00:03:45.910> a<00:03:45.940> 9-volt<00:03:46.390> battery<00:03:46.810> system

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
was for a 9-volt battery system

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.730 
was for a 9-volt battery system
benefited<00:03:48.610> exactly<00:03:49.120> on<00:03:49.270> to<00:03:49.480> the<00:03:49.740> controller

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:50.740 
benefited exactly on to the controller

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.300 
benefited exactly on to the controller
there<00:03:51.240> and<00:03:52.240> I've<00:03:52.540> just<00:03:52.620> run<00:03:53.620> the<00:03:53.740> cabling<00:03:54.160> all

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
there and I've just run the cabling all

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.270 
there and I've just run the cabling all
the<00:03:54.430> way<00:03:54.520> back<00:03:54.760> to<00:03:55.090> where<00:03:55.450> my<00:03:55.480> battery

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
the way back to where my battery

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.550 
the way back to where my battery
connection<00:03:57.280> goes<00:03:57.520> and<00:03:57.910> soldered<00:03:58.720> soldered

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
connection goes and soldered soldered

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.410 
connection goes and soldered soldered
into<00:03:59.920> that<00:04:00.820> main<00:04:01.120> link<00:04:01.890> which<00:04:02.890> is<00:04:02.920> before<00:04:03.580> the

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:04.420 
into that main link which is before the

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:10.530 
into that main link which is before the
battery<00:04:05.850> connection<00:04:08.490> i<00:04:09.490> found<00:04:09.970> that<00:04:10.030> was<00:04:10.300> the

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
battery connection i found that was the

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.180 
battery connection i found that was the
one<00:04:10.959> of<00:04:11.020> the<00:04:11.080> easiest<00:04:11.380> way<00:04:11.590> that<00:04:11.860> way<00:04:12.010> it's

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
one of the easiest way that way it's

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.210 
one of the easiest way that way it's
always<00:04:12.370> also<00:04:13.080> powered<00:04:14.080> and<00:04:14.380> you<00:04:14.830> don't<00:04:15.040> need<00:04:15.160> a

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
always also powered and you don't need a

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:22.180 
always also powered and you don't need a
separate<00:04:15.640> battery<00:04:15.850> to<00:04:16.359> operate<00:04:17.320> the<00:04:17.440> winch
