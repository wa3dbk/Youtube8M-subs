00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
addictive it's very easy to read and

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.970 
addictive it's very easy to read and
it's<00:02:59.210> not<00:02:59.330> like<00:02:59.450> your<00:02:59.630> standard<00:02:59.840> book<00:03:00.170> it's

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
it's not like your standard book it's

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.980 
it's not like your standard book it's
very<00:03:01.250> nicely<00:03:02.180> done<00:03:02.510> on<00:03:02.720> these<00:03:02.810> beautiful

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
very nicely done on these beautiful

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.610 
very nicely done on these beautiful
