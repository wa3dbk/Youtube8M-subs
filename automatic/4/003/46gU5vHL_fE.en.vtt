didn't work I put my hot rollers in this
hair<00:02:17.110> and<00:02:18.690> left<00:02:19.690> it<00:02:19.810> in<00:02:19.930> overnight<00:02:20.260> on<00:02:20.770> a

hair and left it in overnight on a

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.950 
hair and left it in overnight on a
mannequin<00:02:21.310> head<00:02:21.520> and<00:02:21.820> I<00:02:22.000> took<00:02:22.270> rollers<00:02:22.780> out

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
mannequin head and I took rollers out

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:28.890 
mannequin head and I took rollers out
this<00:02:23.200> morning<00:02:23.710> and<00:02:24.930> this<00:02:25.930> is<00:02:26.110> what<00:02:26.260> I<00:02:26.290> have<00:02:27.900> can

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
you see this I know it says let me find

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.250 
you see this I know it says let me find
what<00:02:35.290> exactly<00:02:35.800> what<00:02:35.950> it<00:02:36.070> says<00:02:36.310> here<00:02:36.820> it<00:02:37.720> says

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
what exactly what it says here it says

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.110 
what exactly what it says here it says
you<00:02:39.190> can<00:02:39.400> read<00:02:39.640> that<00:02:39.910> it<00:02:40.360> says<00:02:41.550> maximum<00:02:42.550> curl

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
you can read that it says maximum curl

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.760 
you can read that it says maximum curl
or<00:02:43.270> retention<00:02:43.890> right<00:02:44.890> there<00:02:46.020> yeah<00:02:47.020> I'm<00:02:47.410> not<00:02:47.620> so

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
or retention right there yeah I'm not so

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.740 
or retention right there yeah I'm not so
convinced<00:02:48.250> on<00:02:48.370> that<00:02:50.490> because<00:02:51.490> you're<00:02:52.330> looking

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
convinced on that because you're looking

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.950 
convinced on that because you're looking
at<00:02:52.870> the<00:02:52.990> product<00:02:53.470> of<00:02:54.120> maximum<00:02:55.120> crow<00:02:55.390> attention

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:55.960 
at the product of maximum crow attention

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.660 
at the product of maximum crow attention
on<00:02:56.110> my<00:02:56.260> head<00:02:56.560> right<00:02:56.920> now<00:02:56.950> it<00:02:57.280> didn't<00:02:57.580> really

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
on my head right now it didn't really

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:58.140 
on my head right now it didn't really
curl

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
curl

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.810 
curl
I<00:02:58.360> mean<00:02:58.540> maximum<00:02:59.200> wave<00:03:01.380> retention<00:03:02.380> or<00:03:02.820> maximum

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
I mean maximum wave retention or maximum

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.820 
I mean maximum wave retention or maximum
kind<00:03:04.720> of<00:03:04.930> Bend<00:03:06.480> retention<00:03:07.480> but<00:03:07.870> other<00:03:08.590> than

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
kind of Bend retention but other than

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.090 
kind of Bend retention but other than
that<00:03:08.950> no<00:03:09.670> like<00:03:10.290> when<00:03:11.290> I<00:03:11.320> first<00:03:11.709> took<00:03:11.920> the

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
that no like when I first took the

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.400 
that no like when I first took the
rollers<00:03:12.459> out<00:03:12.700> I<00:03:13.000> mean<00:03:13.180> it<00:03:13.330> had<00:03:13.540> some<00:03:14.110> sort<00:03:14.260> of

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
rollers out I mean it had some sort of

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.680 
rollers out I mean it had some sort of
curl<00:03:14.709> but<00:03:15.010> as<00:03:15.130> soon<00:03:15.370> as<00:03:15.400> I<00:03:15.580> put<00:03:15.790> my<00:03:15.820> hand<00:03:15.970> in<00:03:16.510> it

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
curl but as soon as I put my hand in it

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.910 
curl but as soon as I put my hand in it
it<00:03:17.290> just<00:03:17.620> went<00:03:17.890> black<00:03:19.500> walked<00:03:20.500> up<00:03:20.650> side

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
it just went black walked up side

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.910 
it just went black walked up side
bladder<00:03:22.230> went<00:03:23.230> to<00:03:23.350> work<00:03:23.560> and<00:03:23.830> now<00:03:24.730> it's<00:03:24.970> this

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
bladder went to work and now it's this

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.100 
bladder went to work and now it's this
so<00:03:26.920> there<00:03:27.550> you<00:03:27.760> have<00:03:27.790> it<00:03:28.030> I<00:03:28.480> mean<00:03:28.690> that<00:03:28.900> that's

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
so there you have it I mean that that's

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.820 
so there you have it I mean that that's
what<00:03:29.230> happened<00:03:29.680> and<00:03:31.410> you'll<00:03:32.410> see<00:03:32.709> these

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
what happened and you'll see these

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.370 
what happened and you'll see these
pictures<00:03:33.100> of<00:03:33.459> this<00:03:33.610> track<00:03:33.910> own<00:03:34.209> Oh<00:03:34.720> My<00:03:35.140> glob

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
pictures of this track own Oh My glob

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.949 
pictures of this track own Oh My glob
but<00:03:35.769> this<00:03:35.980> is<00:03:36.190> some<00:03:36.850> hair<00:03:37.120> that<00:03:37.150> I<00:03:37.390> sectioned

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
but this is some hair that I sectioned

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.820 
but this is some hair that I sectioned
off<00:03:37.989> a<00:03:38.290> while<00:03:38.620> ago<00:03:39.510> to<00:03:40.510> just<00:03:40.750> do<00:03:41.260> an<00:03:41.380> experiment

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
off a while ago to just do an experiment

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.530 
off a while ago to just do an experiment
of<00:03:42.040> how<00:03:42.070> the<00:03:42.340> hair<00:03:42.700> would<00:03:42.790> react<00:03:43.180> to<00:03:43.420> different

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
of how the hair would react to different

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.430 
of how the hair would react to different
types<00:03:43.959> of<00:03:44.140> that<00:03:44.820> stress<00:03:45.820> filling<00:03:46.300> or<00:03:46.510> curl

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
types of that stress filling or curl

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.920 
types of that stress filling or curl
pattern<00:03:47.769> the<00:03:48.610> first<00:03:48.850> one<00:03:49.090> I<00:03:49.209> believe<00:03:49.360> was<00:03:49.600> like

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
pattern the first one I believe was like

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.490 
pattern the first one I believe was like
a<00:03:50.019> regular<00:03:50.340> free<00:03:51.340> and<00:03:51.670> as<00:03:51.970> you<00:03:52.150> can

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
a regular free and as you can

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.670 
a regular free and as you can
it<00:03:52.800> is<00:03:53.010> just<00:03:53.340> bone<00:03:54.150> straight<00:03:54.600> like<00:03:54.990> nothing

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
it is just bone straight like nothing

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.710 
it is just bone straight like nothing
ever<00:03:55.950> happened<00:03:56.220> to<00:03:56.580> it<00:03:56.870> I<00:03:59.120> think<00:04:00.120> this<00:04:00.390> one<00:04:00.630> in

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
ever happened to it I think this one in

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.870 
ever happened to it I think this one in
the<00:04:00.840> middle<00:04:00.870> here<00:04:01.710> was<00:04:02.040> the<00:04:02.190> result<00:04:02.610> of<00:04:02.760> a

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
the middle here was the result of a

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.320 
the middle here was the result of a
braid<00:04:03.210> with<00:04:04.200> heat<00:04:05.040> put<00:04:05.340> to<00:04:05.550> it<00:04:05.700> and<00:04:05.910> so<00:04:06.150> you<00:04:06.270> can

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
braid with heat put to it and so you can

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.620 
braid with heat put to it and so you can
still<00:04:06.690> see<00:04:06.960> the<00:04:07.140> braid<00:04:07.350> pattern<00:04:07.650> in<00:04:07.950> that<00:04:08.630> and

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
still see the braid pattern in that and

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.130 
still see the braid pattern in that and
this<00:04:09.870> one<00:04:10.110> was<00:04:10.290> just<00:04:10.320> a<00:04:10.500> two<00:04:10.709> strand<00:04:11.010> twist<00:04:11.400> and

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 
this one was just a two strand twist and

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.380 
this one was just a two strand twist and
this<00:04:13.140> one<00:04:13.350> was<00:04:13.530> an<00:04:13.650> actual<00:04:13.950> curling<00:04:14.550> iron<00:04:14.760> so

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
this one was an actual curling iron so

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.280 
this one was an actual curling iron so
it<00:04:15.420> still<00:04:15.780> has<00:04:15.959> a<00:04:15.990> curl<00:04:16.320> to<00:04:16.620> it<00:04:17.299> and<00:04:18.299> this<00:04:19.049> one

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
it still has a curl to it and this one

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.840 
it still has a curl to it and this one
was<00:04:19.470> a<00:04:19.709> roller<00:04:21.260> just<00:04:22.260> their<00:04:22.470> roller<00:04:22.710> and<00:04:23.190> just

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
was a roller just their roller and just

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.390 
was a roller just their roller and just
with<00:04:24.000> the<00:04:24.150> hair<00:04:24.530> that's<00:04:25.530> the<00:04:25.770> result<00:04:26.130> that<00:04:26.280> you

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
with the hair that's the result that you

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.460 
with the hair that's the result that you
have<00:04:26.610> that's<00:04:27.330> essentially<00:04:27.720> what<00:04:27.960> I<00:04:27.990> did<00:04:28.080> to

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
have that's essentially what I did to

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.330 
have that's essentially what I did to
this<00:04:28.590> hair<00:04:29.330> this<00:04:30.330> morning<00:04:30.390> and<00:04:31.080> this<00:04:31.950> is<00:04:32.130> what

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
this hair this morning and this is what

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.280 
this hair this morning and this is what

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 
it looks like and true it up this is

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.430 
it looks like and true it up this is
what<00:04:34.500> it<00:04:34.590> looks<00:04:34.770> like<00:04:34.890> oh<00:04:35.070> my<00:04:35.220> head<00:04:35.430> so<00:04:35.820> oh<00:04:36.440> yeah

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
what it looks like oh my head so oh yeah

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.810 
what it looks like oh my head so oh yeah
I<00:04:37.530> remember<00:04:37.800> now<00:04:38.010> if<00:04:38.430> this<00:04:38.669> one<00:04:38.970> was<00:04:40.070> yeah<00:04:41.070> one

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
I remember now if this one was yeah one

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.850 
I remember now if this one was yeah one
of<00:04:41.850> these<00:04:42.120> was<00:04:42.330> just<00:04:42.450> a<00:04:42.510> straight<00:04:42.810> roller<00:04:43.500> with

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
of these was just a straight roller with

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.970 
of these was just a straight roller with
nothing<00:04:44.280> on<00:04:44.580> it<00:04:44.940> just<00:04:45.510> the<00:04:45.660> roller<00:04:45.900> and<00:04:46.290> it<00:04:46.830> was

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:46.980 
nothing on it just the roller and it was

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.520 
nothing on it just the roller and it was
just<00:04:47.190> straight<00:04:47.580> I'll<00:04:48.419> let<00:04:48.660> you<00:04:48.810> know<00:04:48.960> on<00:04:49.380> the

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
just straight I'll let you know on the

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.640 
just straight I'll let you know on the
blog<00:04:49.770> for<00:04:50.100> sure<00:04:50.280> but<00:04:50.580> this<00:04:51.510> is<00:04:51.780> my

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
blog for sure but this is my

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:58.310 
blog for sure but this is my
experimental<00:04:53.310> track<00:04:53.880> hair<00:04:56.810> and<00:04:57.810> that's<00:04:58.169> what

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
experimental track hair and that's what

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.240 
experimental track hair and that's what
happened<00:04:58.700> as<00:04:59.700> far<00:04:59.940> as<00:05:00.180> I<00:05:00.600> know<00:05:00.930> it<00:05:01.200> says<00:05:01.470> tangle

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
happened as far as I know it says tangle

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.300 
happened as far as I know it says tangle
free<00:05:03.050> right<00:05:04.050> here<00:05:04.290> in<00:05:04.410> the<00:05:04.500> packaging<00:05:05.040> and

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
free right here in the packaging and

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.760 
free right here in the packaging and
also<00:05:05.790> on<00:05:06.540> the<00:05:06.810> front<00:05:06.960> of<00:05:07.110> the<00:05:07.200> package<00:05:07.440> it<00:05:07.710> says

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
also on the front of the package it says

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.940 
also on the front of the package it says
tangle<00:05:08.220> free<00:05:08.250> um<00:05:09.060> I<00:05:09.479> would<00:05:09.960> almost<00:05:10.260> agree<00:05:10.800> with

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:10.950 
tangle free um I would almost agree with

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.300 
tangle free um I would almost agree with
that<00:05:11.100> because<00:05:12.410> I've<00:05:13.410> had<00:05:13.650> the<00:05:13.770> hair<00:05:13.979> for<00:05:14.160> so

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
that because I've had the hair for so

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.400 
that because I've had the hair for so
long<00:05:14.550> and<00:05:14.970> it<00:05:15.300> didn't<00:05:15.600> really<00:05:15.750> give<00:05:16.200> me<00:05:16.380> a

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410 
long and it didn't really give me a

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:21.969 
long and it didn't really give me a
first<00:05:16.860> tangle<00:05:17.430> and<00:05:17.729> so<00:05:17.970> about<00:05:18.870> a<00:05:20.419> month<00:05:21.419> in

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:21.979 
first tangle and so about a month in

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:25.909 
first tangle and so about a month in
then<00:05:22.979> I<00:05:23.100> got<00:05:23.280> a<00:05:23.310> tangle<00:05:23.729> and<00:05:24.050> then<00:05:25.050> now<00:05:25.590> they're

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 
then I got a tangle and then now they're

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:28.460 
then I got a tangle and then now they're
they're<00:05:26.310> coming<00:05:26.610> more<00:05:26.790> frequently<00:05:26.940> now<00:05:27.470> as

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470 
they're coming more frequently now as

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.510 
they're coming more frequently now as
far<00:05:28.710> as<00:05:30.470> just<00:05:31.470> run<00:05:31.710> my<00:05:31.860> fingers<00:05:32.280> in

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
far as just run my fingers in

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:37.170 
far as just run my fingers in
that<00:05:32.700> hair<00:05:33.440> just<00:05:34.440> right<00:05:34.740> now

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.180 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:43.080 

no<00:05:38.979> is<00:05:39.190> not<00:05:39.370> my<00:05:39.490> bag<00:05:40.410> at<00:05:41.410> all<00:05:42.090> even

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 
no is not my bag at all even

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:44.730 
no is not my bag at all even
when<00:05:43.270> I<00:05:43.330> get<00:05:43.449> a<00:05:43.570> tangle<00:05:44.050> the<00:05:44.169> shedding<00:05:44.380> really

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740 
when I get a tangle the shedding really

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:51.910 
when I get a tangle the shedding really
isn't<00:05:44.889> that<00:05:45.130> bad<00:05:45.310> so

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:51.920 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.490 

but<00:05:52.580> it's<00:05:53.000> not<00:05:53.090> that<00:05:53.330> it's<00:05:53.390> just<00:05:53.840> very<00:05:53.900> minimal

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:54.500 
but it's not that it's just very minimal

00:05:54.500 --> 00:06:00.640 
but it's not that it's just very minimal
shredding<00:05:54.860> so<00:05:55.150> I<00:05:56.470> took<00:05:57.470> advance<00:05:57.980> plus<00:05:58.400> um<00:05:59.650> but

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:00.650 
shredding so I took advance plus um but

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.250 
shredding so I took advance plus um but
like<00:06:00.740> I<00:06:00.830> said<00:06:00.890> if<00:06:01.310> you<00:06:01.610> want<00:06:01.910> to<00:06:01.970> wear<00:06:02.180> it<00:06:02.360> any

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:03.260 
like I said if you want to wear it any

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.000 
like I said if you want to wear it any
other<00:06:03.350> style<00:06:03.890> besides<00:06:04.960> right<00:06:05.960> here<00:06:06.350> besides

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:07.010 
other style besides right here besides

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:11.140 
other style besides right here besides
being<00:06:07.310> this<00:06:07.640> straight<00:06:08.000> right<00:06:08.210> here<00:06:08.450> I<00:06:10.150> you

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:11.150 
being this straight right here I you

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:16.420 
being this straight right here I you
won't<00:06:11.330> be<00:06:11.450> able<00:06:11.600> to<00:06:11.750> so<00:06:14.740> what<00:06:15.740> I<00:06:15.770> purchased

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:16.430 
won't be able to so what I purchased

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:21.520 
won't be able to so what I purchased
this<00:06:16.550> hair<00:06:16.790> again<00:06:18.580> maybe<00:06:19.580> I<00:06:20.000> think<00:06:20.990> so<00:06:21.200> a

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:21.530 
this hair again maybe I think so a

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:25.420 
this hair again maybe I think so a
strong<00:06:22.220> possibility<00:06:23.920> because<00:06:24.920> when<00:06:25.280> it's

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:25.430 
strong possibility because when it's

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:28.210 
strong possibility because when it's
really<00:06:25.760> bone<00:06:26.120> straight<00:06:26.570> it's<00:06:26.900> so<00:06:27.440> pretty<00:06:27.890> as

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:28.220 
really bone straight it's so pretty as

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.190 
really bone straight it's so pretty as
you<00:06:28.460> will<00:06:28.610> see<00:06:28.820> in<00:06:29.090> the<00:06:29.240> pictures<00:06:29.630> but<00:06:29.660> it's

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:30.200 
you will see in the pictures but it's

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.370 
you will see in the pictures but it's
really<00:06:30.500> pretty<00:06:30.800> when<00:06:31.070> it's<00:06:31.220> bone<00:06:31.370> straight

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:32.380 
really pretty when it's bone straight

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:34.930 
really pretty when it's bone straight
just<00:06:33.380> I<00:06:33.620> just<00:06:33.830> won't<00:06:34.010> be<00:06:34.190> able<00:06:34.220> to<00:06:34.400> wear<00:06:34.640> this

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:34.940 
just I just won't be able to wear this

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:41.200 
just I just won't be able to wear this
wig<00:06:38.110> in<00:06:39.110> any<00:06:39.440> kind<00:06:39.710> of<00:06:39.800> pattern<00:06:40.250> except<00:06:40.940> for

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:41.210 
wig in any kind of pattern except for

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:43.420 
wig in any kind of pattern except for
really<00:06:41.540> straight<00:06:41.900> so<00:06:42.320> I<00:06:42.560> mean<00:06:42.740> even<00:06:42.770> even<00:06:43.190> when

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:43.430 
really straight so I mean even even when

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:46.870 
really straight so I mean even even when
I<00:06:43.490> watched<00:06:43.880> it<00:06:44.800> it<00:06:45.800> didn't<00:06:46.280> matter<00:06:46.400> it's<00:06:46.760> still

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:46.880 
I watched it it didn't matter it's still

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.990 
I watched it it didn't matter it's still
wanting<00:06:47.720> to<00:06:47.750> stay<00:06:48.130> straight<00:06:49.130> and<00:06:49.190> not<00:06:49.640> hold

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:50.000 
wanting to stay straight and not hold

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.840 
wanting to stay straight and not hold
any<00:06:50.420> type<00:06:50.900> of<00:06:50.930> curl<00:06:51.320> and<00:06:51.620> that's<00:06:51.980> what<00:06:52.310> it<00:06:52.430> is<00:06:52.610> I

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:52.850 
any type of curl and that's what it is I

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:55.510 
any type of curl and that's what it is I
mean<00:06:52.940> I<00:06:53.390> guess<00:06:53.990> in<00:06:54.260> order<00:06:54.650> for<00:06:54.830> it<00:06:54.920> to<00:06:54.950> actually

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:55.520 
mean I guess in order for it to actually

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.430 
mean I guess in order for it to actually
hold<00:06:55.700> a<00:06:55.850> curl<00:06:56.090> you've<00:06:56.450> had<00:06:56.600> to<00:06:56.810> separate<00:06:57.260> this

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:57.440 
hold a curl you've had to separate this

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.950 
hold a curl you've had to separate this
hair<00:06:57.740> literally<00:06:58.550> track-by-track<00:06:59.210> on<00:06:59.750> your

00:06:59.950 --> 00:06:59.960 
hair literally track-by-track on your

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.600 
hair literally track-by-track on your
head<00:07:00.200> and<00:07:00.500> go<00:07:00.770> through<00:07:01.070> it<00:07:01.100> with<00:07:01.220> a<00:07:01.340> curling

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:01.610 
head and go through it with a curling

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:04.390 
head and go through it with a curling
iron<00:07:01.970> I<00:07:02.330> mean<00:07:03.080> this<00:07:03.260> this<00:07:03.500> kind<00:07:03.800> of<00:07:03.950> makes<00:07:04.220> me

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:04.400 
iron I mean this this kind of makes me

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.850 
iron I mean this this kind of makes me
believe<00:07:04.580> that<00:07:05.060> by<00:07:05.390> the<00:07:05.450> way<00:07:05.720> this<00:07:06.020> curl<00:07:06.530> is

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:06.860 
believe that by the way this curl is

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:10.170 
believe that by the way this curl is
still<00:07:07.130> there<00:07:07.480> from<00:07:08.480> that<00:07:08.750> one<00:07:09.110> curling<00:07:09.950> arm

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:10.180 
still there from that one curling arm

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:13.450 
still there from that one curling arm
this<00:07:11.180> one<00:07:11.570> track<00:07:12.020> it<00:07:12.470> makes<00:07:12.860> me<00:07:13.070> believe<00:07:13.250> that

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:13.460 
this one track it makes me believe that

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:18.400 
this one track it makes me believe that
you're<00:07:13.880> really<00:07:14.150> going<00:07:14.540> to<00:07:14.660> need<00:07:14.960> to<00:07:17.410> separate

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:18.410 
you're really going to need to separate
