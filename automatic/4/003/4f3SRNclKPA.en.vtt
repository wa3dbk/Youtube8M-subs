because they are nice and form and they

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.130 
because they are nice and form and they
keep<00:02:24.530> your<00:02:24.739> hair<00:02:25.099> in<00:02:25.459> a<00:02:25.790> uniform<00:02:26.360> shape<00:02:26.569> all

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
keep your hair in a uniform shape all

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.559 
keep your hair in a uniform shape all
the<00:02:27.200> way<00:02:27.379> around<00:02:27.849> sometimes<00:02:28.849> with<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.239> sock

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
the way around sometimes with the sock

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.229 
the way around sometimes with the sock
they're<00:02:30.379> not<00:02:30.709> as<00:02:30.980> firm<00:02:31.370> when<00:02:31.700> you<00:02:31.790> roll<00:02:32.030> them

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
they're not as firm when you roll them

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.259 
they're not as firm when you roll them
down<00:02:32.650> so<00:02:33.650> that's<00:02:33.890> why<00:02:34.129> I<00:02:34.160> really<00:02:34.519> like<00:02:34.849> to<00:02:35.060> use

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
down so that's why I really like to use

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:40.270 
down so that's why I really like to use
these<00:02:35.510> forms<00:02:36.280> here<00:02:38.829> and<00:02:39.829> I<00:02:39.920> think<00:02:40.160> they

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
these forms here and I think they

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.640 
these forms here and I think they
thought<00:02:40.459> that<00:02:40.519> donut<00:02:41.090> bun<00:02:41.269> or<00:02:41.450> something<00:02:41.870> when

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
thought that donut bun or something when

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.170 
thought that donut bun or something when
you're<00:02:42.769> bad<00:02:42.920> other<00:02:43.160> stores<00:02:43.610> I<00:02:43.670> think<00:02:43.880> the<00:02:43.970> cost

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
you're bad other stores I think the cost

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:50.979 
you're bad other stores I think the cost
may<00:02:44.480> be<00:02:45.430> to<00:02:47.110> $2.99<00:02:48.110> or<00:02:48.140> so<00:02:48.620> in<00:02:48.980> the<00:02:49.700> store<00:02:50.030> now

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
may be to $2.99 or so in the store now

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:52.869 
may be to $2.99 or so in the store now
I'm<00:02:51.049> going<00:02:51.379> to<00:02:51.500> go<00:02:51.650> ahead<00:02:51.709> and<00:02:52.220> spritz<00:02:52.640> the
