that<00:00:36.470> it<00:00:36.920> wasn't<00:00:37.070> working<00:00:37.489> for<00:00:37.519> me<00:00:38.110> just<00:00:39.110> just

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
that it wasn't working for me just just

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.320 
that it wasn't working for me just just
so<00:00:39.920> you<00:00:40.010> know<00:00:40.160> what<00:00:40.550> you<00:00:40.670> have<00:00:40.820> to<00:00:40.970> do<00:00:41.059> is<00:00:41.180> not

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:41.330 
so you know what you have to do is not

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:42.580 
so you know what you have to do is not
believe<00:00:41.629> the<00:00:41.750> application<00:00:42.230> like<00:00:42.350> they<00:00:42.440> did

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
believe the application like they did

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.439 
believe the application like they did
there<00:00:42.800> even<00:00:43.100> though<00:00:43.250> you<00:00:43.489> probably<00:00:43.730> could<00:00:44.150> in

00:00:44.439 --> 00:00:44.449 
there even though you probably could in

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:46.330 
there even though you probably could in

case this isn't your problem what you
have<00:00:46.460> to<00:00:46.519> do<00:00:46.610> is<00:00:46.699> go<00:00:46.820> online<00:00:46.970> and<00:00:47.449> go<00:00:48.199> to<00:00:48.230> the

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:48.470 
have to do is go online and go to the

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.549 
have to do is go online and go to the
dev<00:00:48.980> team<00:00:49.190> blog<00:00:49.250> and<00:00:49.879> if<00:00:50.479> you<00:00:50.510> look<00:00:50.989> closely<00:00:51.229> in

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
torrent download and that's what I did

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.869 
torrent download and that's what I did
and<00:01:00.530> that's<00:01:00.739> why<00:01:00.830> I<00:01:00.920> wasn't<00:01:01.129> working<00:01:01.430> in<00:01:01.760> the

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
and that's why I wasn't working in the

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:03.700 
and that's why I wasn't working in the
and<00:01:02.030> if<00:01:02.420> you<00:01:02.540> do<00:01:02.690> that<00:01:02.869> and<00:01:03.049> won't<00:01:03.199> patch<00:01:03.440> the

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
and if you do that and won't patch the

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.730 
and if you do that and won't patch the
iboot<00:01:04.010> so<00:01:04.790> now<00:01:05.690> what<00:01:06.260> you<00:01:06.380> do<00:01:06.470> is<00:01:06.500> just
