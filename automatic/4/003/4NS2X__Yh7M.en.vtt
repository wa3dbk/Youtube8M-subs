 from chef d'escale to orly but also with 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.539
 this responsibility of director of

 ground operations since responsible for 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.019
 all long-haul air stops 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.540
 caribbean atlantic and as soon as the airbus 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:18.049
 then becomes the chief 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.480
 stop after the sale of the 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:22.400
 ticket so from the moment that the 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.080
 client whether on the internet that this 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.480
 either by a travel agency that this 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.380
 either by a counter to buy his 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.209
 ticket 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.799
 snaps the exploitation part so 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.829
 our responsibility as a leader 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:36.620
 stopover he arrives at the airport he 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:37.670
 record he downstairs he's talking 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.160
 until they leave the airport 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.849
 with luggage or luggage 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.579
 registered 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:46.400
 that's where our limit stops so the 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:48.220
 early the ticket presale until 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.690
 that customers leave the airport 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.760
 there are irregularities that can be 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.250
 multiple order we can have a 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.630
 irregularity crate weather conditions that 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.609
 will be independent of us and we 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.900
 will be required to postpone or cancel 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:01.760
 flights according to the weather 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.120
 so we mainly have an information role 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.950
 of communication because the client has 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.510
 bought a ticket on the company and 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.489
 our goal is to bring it the most 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:15.410
 quickly possible to the point that he has 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:17.600
 bought that he wants to be able to reach already 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:21.940
 know how to adapt have a lot of 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:24.260
 self-control and a lot of listening 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.630
 because if we do not listen to each other we do not 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.319
 will already not meet his expectations and 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:31.549
 we do so that discontent 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:32.750
 listen to know how to adapt we do not have 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:35.120
 always we can not write everything in 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.060
 procedures but sometimes we have to 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.380
 also be able to innovate to see you by 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.730
 report to the situation find some 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:44.660
 solutions because that's the goal before 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:46.130
 find all the solutions then no the 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.079
 choice is Caribbean on the stopover 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.359
 d'orly it's subcontracting my 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:53.269
 live team and compounds of four 

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:55.160
 people and we need to treat and 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:57.829
 especially oversee all the under 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.209
 dealing with us so the difficulty is 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:01.040
 that there are different levels of 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:02.959
 communication and it's not always 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.319
 obvious and that's where sometimes but there are 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:04.240
 hiccups 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:07.020
 we must also be able to 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.020
 adapted to be able to beat him
