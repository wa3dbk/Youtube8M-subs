00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.440
 and we left again this time it's the 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:10.349
 sixth step then profiles completely 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:13.559
 flat so we have to play the card 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.490
 cavendish as usual for them 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.760
 sprint finishes 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.840
 nobody in the breakaway because on 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.660
 a step like that it's impossible 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.500
 to go to the end here we have five runners 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:29.099
 in front of a very thin advance so they 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:32.880
 are going to be easily picked up on 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.570
 the end so we have runners who 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.129
 are in shape 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:40.290
 ch'ti bar kotowski banana cavendish tony 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.760
 martin is a little lighter by 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.410
 against so in my opinion I will not 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.379
 integrate it into my sprint train for 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.399
 be sure that it works 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:50.219
 or so I'll put it first 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:54.300
 because of neither gloves nor 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.710
 Bakelandts look hot there 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.239
 coming soon to the end we will increase 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.390
 the level of the runners 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.660
 except 2002 that are not used for this 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.660
 step 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.469
 18km a minute and thirty we go 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.899
 make up 17 km 

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:19.619
 we will launch our little train then this 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:21.770
 who annoys me a little martinez the 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:26.549
 coast which is a little bit behind 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:32.030
 so we'll throw Martin first and then 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:35.640
 and then we will put 85 besides 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:41.280
 what are we going to do? 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:43.399
 put slibard boonen that I know 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.399
 not 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.430
 martin who leaves like a ball 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:59.250
 what makes our picture what the 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.250
 do not do well miguel and it looks 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.790
 ok there everyone is put as he 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:15.210
 we must be able to go there properly 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.210
 it's gone 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.700
 usual little train there a minute 13 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:25.940
 still the breakaway good 10 km we go 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.940
 catch up 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.079
 kotowski that a little bit of trouble to follow 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:39.360
 so the rhythm of tony martin he is 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:44.370
 still less even made a 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:46.439
 amazing hole it'll stop now 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.319
 kotowski we will put it to the bottom tony 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:50.849
 martin thank you worked well 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:54.180
 so here we are going to be a little bit just 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:55.950
 to go after a poet offs who he 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.049
 will not take us very long this 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.459
 look there even though I put it back to 95 he 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:06.540
 will not serve us long she has 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:08.370
 finished now let's put a little 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.379
 bar then this picture apart lemaitre to 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.049
 99 because it's going to be right then there 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:16.349
 we have a friend leave we have a soul neither 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:17.849
 sagan that made the hole I think the 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:20.569
 platoon got up because of 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:23.639
 the breakaway so we're going to enjoy it 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:25.560
 that's what will take my son 

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:27.590
 is dead we'll finish with boonen it's 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.250
 not serious 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.879
 and cavendish 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:37.560
 we do not have many of us anymore 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:39.599
 a lot of opponents 1 here they are 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.879
 all trapped there good there is a little bit of 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:43.410
 wind so that can be it can be a 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:44.629
 border stroke simply and that's 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:47.430
 for that they can not get in anymore 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:49.440
 and ben we will enjoy a step of 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.859
 problem we shave nizzolo wood neither 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.480
 christophe appollonio and kid good 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:57.090
 opponent to the measure of cavendish without 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.819
 problem the last survivor of 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.109
 the breakaway that is here will not have any 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:03.349
 problem to catch up with it during the 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:03.349
 sprint 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:09.290
 then we come to a mile and a half 

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:09.290
 and I run my sprint for cavendish 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:18.180
 a victory hands down in my opinion 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:20.670
 thanks to the wind and in my opinion the fact that 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.320
 the platoon did not have so said that 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:25.830
 it was the breakaway she's played at 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:29.310
 yann here is a good operation 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:31.800
 for cavendish who in addition will score 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.960
 by itself the cost of points for the 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.690
 barca guen who's coming who's the present 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.330
 leader of the green jersey 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.090
 we will be able to paste them it's always 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.800
 good to take 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:47.090
 that's it for this sixth step won 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.090
 almost easily
