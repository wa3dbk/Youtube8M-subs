00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 hello if you stayed yesterday was May 4th and not 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.730
 We wanted to miss the opportunity to 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.730
 say hello, miraflores 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.299
 we begin with the obvious this end of 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.020
 week that filter was released and what 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:21.170
 we went to see excited and got excited 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.580
 and this Thursday you can see a little more 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.530
 what was our visit to the preview 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.450
 of the friends that we meet there 

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:28.730
 but meanwhile we want 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.140
 share a concern what wave 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.450
 with its noises the director of the 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.950
 movie from a few weeks ago I os 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.960
 has been jumping several statements that 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.520
 denote some annoyance with marvel in 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.110
 the last days of the press tour 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.420
 wii where of course it will not go back to 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.400
 make a movie for the msv though 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.440
 stated that he could perform functions of 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.420
 external consultant and if they call it 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.190
 he says he feels very tired but for 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.900
 moments until seems to feel happy 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.910
 if that weight had been finally removed 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.620
 over then he added that he regrets 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.300
 have revived the mattress agent for 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.220
 who star in the series james jones 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.500
 you when it comes to movies 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.180
 he is still dead on it showed 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.829
 a frustration with having to do that 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.050
 the movie connects with the series 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:08.390
 task that I found frustrating and heavy 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.979
 for us and many more the series 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.020
 produced by his brother and sister-in-law 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.520
 reached its best point when it 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.590
 related to the events of the winter 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:17.330
 schouler but this great work to unite 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.850
 the different franchises do not seem 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.410
 greatly affect your opinion also stated 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.390
 that struggled to be weak is a 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.680
 movie and not a series but 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.600
 perspective that was the decision 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.750
 correct what will happen with we do not 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.970
 will be simply very tired will feel 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.619
 that is no longer worthy will coordinate the 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.630
 marvel movie universe up 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.369
 the moment has been a titanic task and 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.229
 we assume that you must exhaust even the most 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:40.610
 strong of mortals now that the 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.470
 Russian brothers will take over the 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.140
 franchise can rest joss whedon 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.980
 you were worthy let others raise the 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.570
 hammer 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:53.180
 and in other michael bay franchises 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.800

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.240
 twitter account some of the photos 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.880
 of what the vehicles of the 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.410
 sequel to ninja turtles and although 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.720
 it looks like a reused utility 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.340
 Transformers maybe the most interesting thing 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.430
 it's color revealed the first image of 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.289

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.640

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.340
 that we meet again in michael bay 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.790
