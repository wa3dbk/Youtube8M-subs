00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.890
 How about friends in this new video 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.380
 I'm going to show you how we're going to configure 

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:19.590
 how are we going to program a new control 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:24.240
 in this this vehicle is a truck 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:26.940
 a ford f-150 or one for wolf is what it is 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.029
 the same procedure this here we have 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.790
 the control that we want to configure and 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.320
 also the kite already has a 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:36.900
 found to own this we want it 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.269
 to do is that the two controls work 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.030
 and know the procedure that I'm going to 

00:00:39.269 --> 00:00:43.739
 show below good and in follow 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.239
 the procedure is not very difficult just 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.190
 we must make sure that in the first place 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.379
 sure they are found so they 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.640
 find the vehicle unlocked this 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.559
 that is the doors well 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.110
 closed and insurances the glasses 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:59.590
 upstairs since it 's like this we're going to open 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:07.090
 will be 18 times ending in a 1 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:09.100
 3 4 5 6 7 8 we are going to confirm that you have 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.510
 entered the new programming already 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.979
 from this moment we must 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.660
 press the controls that we want 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:15.660
 program with the lock key 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:23.150
 control configured the following control 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:24.980
 configured 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.140
 and in case we wanted to eliminate 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:29.060
 some control this simply does not 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.310
 we press on it we just close 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.240
 the switch 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.250
 only the controls to which 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.500
 we press are those that are left 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.720
 configured if we have we have more 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.280
 controls and we do not press them while 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.380
 I was in programming mode them 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.750
 they will simply be eliminated from 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.720
 system and only the 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.210
 controls that we press while 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.670
 I was in programming this this 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.450
 it would be all from my part my friends and we 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.450
 we see in the next
