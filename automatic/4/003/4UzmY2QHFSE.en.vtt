00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.650
 we train nice competitions to 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:16.910
 to look well I have to say the first 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.500
 half or 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.869
 second half of humanity then I thought 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.920
 it gets used to the parent party there 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:23.029
 but again quickly indeed 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.980
 thought it was a competition in which 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.330
 twente started as we expected 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.160
 they want to put pressure , we want that 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.470
 also because of that there was already one open 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.490
 found that we were on a secret and 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.500
 trainers that come fully to us 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.059
 We were busy early 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.920
 put the ball quickly and conquered 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:38.239
 at that stage the fun and then make a 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.379
 also had enough chance under two 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:40.970
 making zeros 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:42.050
 unfortunately that does not happen and then 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.239
 do you see that in the minds of 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.770
 players probably something unconscious 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:47.059
 something comes from having that lead 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.440
 hold on to them so they don't move forward 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:50.120
 put pressure but go backwards 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.130
 walk and that is the moment when you have it 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.960
 gives initiative and then develops 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.399
 a match like the one we have the second 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.480
 half have seen initiative lay with 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:58.250
 twente 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.440
 they have had a number of opportunities 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.210
 did not run any exaggerated filming though 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.989
 number of chances and that was because we 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.390
 it industry view 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.860
 the zero for the first time this season 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.660
 yes is sacred for a keeper I have there 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.890
 twice close to last time 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.850
 we asked you here in the eighth 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.070
 soothe 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.850
 and against heracles at home and the 91 white ones 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.369
 chiffon chickens 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.960
 but yes we know what we can follow 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:19.670
 We have 13 times so we strive for more 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.720
 and we are hard at it 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.090
 trainer to the 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.869
 you see trainer takes time but we have 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.869
 succeeded first 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.660
 maaike congratulations it was with you 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:34.640
 inside are Japanese fever and the the 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:38.990
 three points because it is so will 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.119
 good for tess i think yes said a lot 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.590
 in 20 the last two weeks the one 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:43.580
 good wins achieved what did you find 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.500
 from them 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.240
 yes it is a very strong team team 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.660
 I think a heavy one in shape 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.970
 but yes where better as a group today 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.800
 I think yes knew what good result 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.960
 during that 211 as you pass the side 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.160
 set the tone in chic to twente 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.810
 has 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.119
 it is especially how the walk backwards 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.229
 try it and still convert 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.060
 you are analyzing together 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.770
 where does that come from? 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.690
 is that we can fix it 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.860
 it so that you are a player for a player 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.940
 can exchange or you may need to 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.590
 start playing in a different way 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.420
 that is what you constantly go to it 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.890
 we are looking for a real team 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.960
 performance of this massive rock hard 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.910
 worked and 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.990
 a beautiful victory yes take it 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.940
 so important i follow have covered 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.190
 stand and came to see every time pressure 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:29.050
 is then from some away but 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.000
 we also map each other and you knokke 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.610
 sees that the result 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.840
 only after our side can grow and 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.580
 if you see today we just have one 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.080
 good sites delivered with three points 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.550
 nice and clean at home 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.460
 yes one more the first half after that 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.080
 big chance piazon on the pole bad luck h20 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.280
 and then that moment where you 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.780
 anyway and it was talking about 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.200
 ball or not over the goal line how sat 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.740
 that no I think kitchen young touch him 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.050
 half 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.760
 comes over my leg in the mess 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.740
 hand is on the goal line magura there 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.270
 behind so he certainly not or the 18 and 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.490
 you were right on the couch 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.320
 the impression that he was just us 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.670
 there are 80 meters away so as like 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.740
 someone who can't see then we are 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.180
 it doesn't have no idea you have the most 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.350
 enjoyed today 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.600
 from the tim you exist that we are for each other 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.530
 and that we just moments 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.170
 existed 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.890
 and we say we learn there 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.890
 computer programming
