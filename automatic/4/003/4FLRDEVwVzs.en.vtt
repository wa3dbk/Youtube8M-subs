and a new tensioner I've had a lot of

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.849 
and a new tensioner I've had a lot of
problem<00:00:19.890> actually<00:00:20.070> and<00:00:20.490> it's<00:00:21.119> all<00:00:21.270> down<00:00:21.510> to

this uzuki service manual I'll explain
to<00:00:25.529> that<00:00:25.680> if<00:00:26.430> you're<00:00:26.580> going<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:26.760> do<00:00:26.939> a<00:00:26.970> timing

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420

chain of one of these ignore what the
Suzuki<00:00:31.230> service<00:00:31.590> manual<00:00:31.949> says<00:00:32.130> but<00:00:32.340> because

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
Suzuki service manual says but because

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.520 
Suzuki service manual says but because
it<00:00:32.790> is<00:00:33.030> rock<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:33.630> I<00:00:33.870> will<00:00:34.050> show<00:00:34.200> you<00:00:34.230> white

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
okay so the cylinder head face which is

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.710 
okay so the cylinder head face which is
here<00:01:01.500> which<00:01:01.800> is<00:01:01.829> fine<00:01:02.239> okay<00:01:03.239> it<00:01:03.960> says<00:01:04.260> then<00:01:05.720> to

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
here which is fine okay it says then to

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.320 
here which is fine okay it says then to
match<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.500> arrows<00:01:07.950> marked<00:01:08.580> on<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.820> intact

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.960 
cam sprocket free to the 15 roller pins
counted<00:01:14.610> from<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.970> exhaust<00:01:15.509> cam<00:01:15.869> sprocket<00:01:16.110> to

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
counted from the exhaust cam sprocket to

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.030 
counted from the exhaust cam sprocket to
which<00:01:17.970> what<00:01:18.210> they're<00:01:18.420> saying<00:01:18.690> is<00:01:18.930> is<00:01:19.560> this

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
which what they're saying is is this

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.999 
which what they're saying is is this
here<00:01:20.369> so<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.030> count<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.630> pins<00:01:22.159> up<00:01:23.600> to<00:01:24.600> free<00:01:25.080> we

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
here so you count the pins up to free we

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.960 
here so you count the pins up to free we
should<00:01:26.340> count<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.850> 15<00:01:27.710> now<00:01:28.710> before<00:01:29.190> I<00:01:29.220> took<00:01:29.369> my

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
should count to 15 now before I took my

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.730 
should count to 15 now before I took my
old<00:01:30.330> chain<00:01:30.630> apart<00:01:31.550> here<00:01:32.550> I<00:01:32.820> did<00:01:33.149> put<00:01:33.450> so<00:01:34.110> let's

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
old chain apart here I did put so let's

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.490 
old chain apart here I did put so let's
get<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:35.009> screwdriver<00:01:35.430> I<00:01:35.850> can<00:01:36.030> show<00:01:36.240> you<00:01:36.300> I<00:01:36.570> did

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
get a screwdriver I can show you I did

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
this cam round so you've got 15 pins now

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.490 
this cam round so you've got 15 pins now
if<00:02:46.380> you<00:02:46.500> put<00:02:46.680> it<00:02:46.769> on<00:02:46.860> 15<00:02:47.459> as<00:02:47.640> the<00:02:47.670> book<00:02:48.060> says<00:02:48.500> it

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
if you put it on 15 as the book says it

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.920 
if you put it on 15 as the book says it
will<00:02:49.799> not<00:02:50.010> start<00:02:50.370> now<00:02:50.519> so<00:02:50.790> one<00:02:51.180> two<00:02:51.450> thousand

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
will not start now so one two thousand

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.870 
will not start now so one two thousand
in<00:02:52.049> there<00:02:52.260> but<00:02:52.860> it's<00:02:52.950> enough<00:02:53.250> for<00:02:53.280> it<00:02:53.489> not<00:02:53.670> to

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
in there but it's enough for it not to

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.180 
in there but it's enough for it not to
start<00:02:54.209> it<00:02:54.750> won't<00:02:55.049> do<00:02:55.230> valve<00:02:55.470> damages<00:02:56.010> I've

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
start it won't do valve damages I've

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.940 
start it won't do valve damages I've
discovered<00:02:56.639> but<00:02:57.480> it<00:02:57.600> will<00:02:57.780> not<00:02:57.959> start<00:02:58.260> so

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
discovered but it will not start so

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.400 
discovered but it will not start so
before<00:02:59.489> you<00:02:59.549> take<00:02:59.730> the<00:02:59.880> chain<00:03:00.120> off<00:03:00.200> make<00:03:01.200> your

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
before you take the chain off make your

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.190 
before you take the chain off make your
own<00:03:01.530> marks<00:03:02.010> ignore<00:03:02.790> the<00:03:02.940> book<00:03:03.209> and<00:03:03.989> put<00:03:04.170> it

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
own marks ignore the book and put it

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.110 
own marks ignore the book and put it
back<00:03:04.410> to<00:03:04.620> your<00:03:04.709> own<00:03:04.859> marks<00:03:05.280> because<00:03:05.459> if<00:03:05.700> you<00:03:05.850> do

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
back to your own marks because if you do

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.840 
back to your own marks because if you do
it<00:03:06.269> to<00:03:06.930> 15<00:03:07.410> pins<00:03:07.769> like<00:03:08.069> they're<00:03:08.280> saying<00:03:08.549> it

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
it to 15 pins like they're saying it

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.520 
it to 15 pins like they're saying it
won't<00:03:09.239> start<00:03:09.600> now

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
won't start now

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.229 
won't start now
I'm<00:03:10.769> normally<00:03:11.310> pretty<00:03:11.370> trusting<00:03:12.030> in<00:03:12.150> the

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
I'm normally pretty trusting in the

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:13.910 
I'm normally pretty trusting in the
Japanese<00:03:12.720> and<00:03:12.930> their<00:03:13.049> servicemen<00:03:13.530> isn't<00:03:13.829> only

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
Japanese and their servicemen isn't only

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.220 
Japanese and their servicemen isn't only
pretty<00:03:14.220> good<00:03:14.489> but<00:03:15.359> I<00:03:15.389> think<00:03:15.569> the<00:03:15.750> poor<00:03:16.019> guy

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
pretty good but I think the poor guy

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.930 
pretty good but I think the poor guy
that<00:03:16.440> wrote<00:03:16.650> this<00:03:16.889> really<00:03:17.609> needs<00:03:17.819> to<00:03:17.880> be

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
that wrote this really needs to be

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.030 
that wrote this really needs to be
putting<00:03:18.150> himself<00:03:18.599> down<00:03:18.810> on<00:03:18.870> the<00:03:18.989> salt<00:03:19.319> and<00:03:19.920> if

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
putting himself down on the salt and if

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.920 
putting himself down on the salt and if
I<00:03:20.160> was<00:03:20.280> behind<00:03:20.519> him<00:03:20.819> I<00:03:20.940> would<00:03:21.359> probably<00:03:21.510> push

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
I was behind him I would probably push

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.660 
I was behind him I would probably push
him<00:03:22.109> because<00:03:22.380> I<00:03:22.620> don't<00:03:22.859> like<00:03:23.040> wasting<00:03:23.250> time
