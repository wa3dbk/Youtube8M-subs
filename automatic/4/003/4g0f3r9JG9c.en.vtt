gonna<00:01:33.119> go<00:01:33.270> in<00:01:33.390> new<00:01:33.539> musical<00:01:33.959> directions<00:01:34.380> but

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
gonna go in new musical directions but

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.119

you<00:01:35.610> don't<00:01:36.119> really<00:01:36.360> know<00:01:36.659> where<00:01:36.959> so<00:01:37.530> you<00:01:37.590> sort

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:38.129 
you don't really know where so you sort

00:01:38.129 --> 00:01:41.479 
you don't really know where so you sort
of<00:01:38.160> like<00:01:38.929> keep<00:01:39.929> yourself<00:01:40.200> open<00:01:40.379> to<00:01:40.590> all<00:01:41.310> the

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:44.129 
possibilities and I think that's the

00:01:44.129 --> 00:01:44.660 
possibilities and I think that's the
goal

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
goal

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.609
