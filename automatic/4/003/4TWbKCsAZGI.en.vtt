00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.960 

that's<00:00:21.550> the<00:00:21.670> philosophy<00:00:21.850> of<00:00:22.300> the<00:00:23.080> University

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
that's the philosophy of the University

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.760 
that's the philosophy of the University
I'd<00:00:24.970> like<00:00:25.330> to<00:00:25.360> sum<00:00:25.840> it<00:00:25.869> up<00:00:26.050> by<00:00:26.110> saying<00:00:26.320> that

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:26.770 
I'd like to sum it up by saying that

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.220 
I'd like to sum it up by saying that
we're<00:00:26.980> a<00:00:27.010> new<00:00:27.520> generation<00:00:28.060> University<00:00:28.900> that's

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230 
we're a new generation University that's

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.499 
we're a new generation University that's
the<00:00:29.349> university<00:00:29.830> with<00:00:29.980> new<00:00:30.160> thinking<00:00:30.670> what

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:31.509 
the university with new thinking what

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:32.820 
the university with new thinking what
that<00:00:31.660> means<00:00:31.930> is<00:00:32.169> that<00:00:32.230> we<00:00:32.529> think<00:00:32.800> very

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:32.830 
that means is that we think very

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.530 
that means is that we think very
carefully<00:00:33.220> about<00:00:33.580> the<00:00:33.879> content<00:00:34.300> of<00:00:34.420> our

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:34.540 
carefully about the content of our

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.439 
carefully about the content of our
courses<00:00:34.960> so<00:00:35.650> that<00:00:35.680> they're<00:00:36.010> relevant<00:00:36.449> to

00:00:37.439 --> 00:00:37.449 
courses so that they're relevant to

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:39.330 
courses so that they're relevant to
students<00:00:38.020> when<00:00:38.170> they<00:00:38.350> leave<00:00:38.530> us<00:00:38.559> go<00:00:39.070> into

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.340 
students when they leave us go into

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.180 
students when they leave us go into
their<00:00:39.730> careers<00:00:40.059> and<00:00:40.360> employment<00:00:40.660> and<00:00:41.190> it's

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
their careers and employment and it's

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.280 
their careers and employment and it's
also<00:00:42.370> in<00:00:42.940> terms<00:00:43.120> of<00:00:43.360> the<00:00:43.570> underpinning

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:45.610 
elements that we have for our courses

elements that we have for our courses
which<00:00:45.879> are<00:00:46.000> built<00:00:46.210> by<00:00:46.390> excellent

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.110 
which are built by excellent

symbolize the building on the tradition
which<00:00:52.510> is<00:00:52.690> why<00:00:52.870> we've<00:00:53.050> got<00:00:53.200> the

which is why we've got the

00:00:59.760 --> 00:00:59.770 
generation our courses are not

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.040 
generation our courses are not
traditional<00:01:00.340> courses<00:01:00.700> so<00:01:01.540> you<00:01:01.600> don't<00:01:01.899> do

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050 
traditional courses so you don't do

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.750 
traditional courses so you don't do
subjects<00:01:02.469> for<00:01:02.590> their<00:01:02.739> own<00:01:02.770> sake<00:01:03.219> but<00:01:03.430> you<00:01:03.579> do

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
subjects for their own sake but you do

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.219 
subjects for their own sake but you do
them<00:01:03.940> because<00:01:04.059> they<00:01:04.330> are<00:01:04.360> applied<00:01:04.839> because

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:05.229 
them because they are applied because

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:07.260 
them because they are applied because
they<00:01:05.470> are<00:01:05.590> relevant<00:01:05.950> to<00:01:06.310> business<00:01:06.820> to<00:01:07.060> the

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
they are relevant to business to the

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.020 
they are relevant to business to the
world<00:01:07.450> of<00:01:07.600> work<00:01:07.840> so<00:01:08.740> it's<00:01:08.890> not<00:01:09.070> about<00:01:09.430> being

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
world of work so it's not about being

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.990 
world of work so it's not about being
new<00:01:10.420> as<00:01:10.690> it<00:01:10.899> is<00:01:11.110> being<00:01:11.649> just<00:01:12.070> built<00:01:12.369> but<00:01:12.820> it's

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
new as it is being just built but it's

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.660 
new as it is being just built but it's
being<00:01:13.320> innovative<00:01:14.320> and<00:01:14.440> modern<00:01:14.770> right<00:01:15.009> that's

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
being innovative and modern right that's

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.150 
being innovative and modern right that's
correct<00:01:16.000> it's<00:01:16.600> very<00:01:16.840> much<00:01:17.080> that<00:01:17.380> that<00:01:17.680> way<00:01:18.009> of

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.160 
correct it's very much that that way of

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.310 
correct it's very much that that way of
thinking<00:01:18.610> which<00:01:18.850> informs<00:01:19.450> all<00:01:19.660> that<00:01:20.020> we<00:01:20.140> do

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
thinking which informs all that we do

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.550 
thinking which informs all that we do
and<00:01:20.649> has<00:01:21.250> actually<00:01:21.610> inspired<00:01:22.090> the<00:01:23.020> name<00:01:23.229> of
