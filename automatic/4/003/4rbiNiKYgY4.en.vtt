uh pass in the next area now i'm pretty
sure<00:00:06.390> if<00:00:06.629> you're<00:00:06.779> just<00:00:06.990> doing<00:00:08.690> the<00:00:09.690> melt<00:00:09.900> quest

sure if you're just doing the melt quest
like<00:00:10.469> in<00:00:10.620> dawn<00:00:10.910> i'm<00:00:11.910> pretty<00:00:12.150> sure<00:00:12.269> you<00:00:12.389> only

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
like in dawn i'm pretty sure you only

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.299 
like in dawn i'm pretty sure you only
need<00:00:12.750> to<00:00:12.780> close<00:00:13.049> three<00:00:13.320> of<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:13.710> four<00:00:13.920> valves

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
need to close three of the four valves

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.650 
need to close three of the four valves
but<00:00:14.519> if<00:00:14.610> you<00:00:14.759> want<00:00:15.030> to<00:00:15.320> get<00:00:16.320> too<00:00:17.210> rare<00:00:18.210> mon<00:00:18.449> the

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
but if you want to get too rare mon the

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.810 
but if you want to get too rare mon the
boss<00:00:18.810> and<00:00:19.080> dusk<00:00:19.380> you<00:00:19.680> need<00:00:19.949> to<00:00:20.039> close<00:00:20.279> all<00:00:20.490> for

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
boss and dusk you need to close all for

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:39.400 
boss and dusk you need to close all for
it<00:00:20.939> you<00:00:21.060> believe

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.770 

so<00:00:40.410> hard<00:00:40.680> climbing<00:00:41.010> up<00:00:41.190> ladders<00:00:41.610> once<00:00:41.880> all

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
so hard climbing up ladders once all

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.540 
so hard climbing up ladders once all
directions<00:00:43.170> just<00:00:43.740> move<00:00:43.920> you<00:00:44.100> at<00:00:44.220> a<00:00:44.250> diagonal

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
directions just move you at a diagonal

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.880 
directions just move you at a diagonal
angle<00:00:45.120> so<00:00:45.660> you<00:00:45.750> have<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:45.990> use<00:00:46.110> two<00:00:46.350> different

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
angle so you have to use two different

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.850 
angle so you have to use two different
directions<00:00:47.730> actually<00:00:48.450> walk<00:00:48.780> straight<00:00:49.350> that's

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
directions actually walk straight that's

00:00:49.860 --> 00:01:18.650 
directions actually walk straight that's
a<00:00:49.980> really<00:00:50.340> annoying

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:18.660 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.020 

okay<00:01:19.660> so<00:01:19.720> that's<00:01:20.470> a<00:01:20.650> dead<00:01:20.950> end<00:01:20.980> that's<00:01:21.610> a<00:01:21.850> dead

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
okay so that's a dead end that's a dead

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.590 
okay so that's a dead end that's a dead
end<00:01:22.860> so<00:01:23.860> there's<00:01:24.430> only<00:01:24.520> one<00:01:24.760> way<00:01:24.880> to<00:01:24.940> go<00:01:25.180> the

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
end so there's only one way to go the

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.340 
end so there's only one way to go the
right<00:01:25.750> way<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:28.000> could<00:01:28.180> go<00:01:28.300> off<00:01:28.660> and<00:01:28.990> the<00:01:29.170> dead

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
right way you could go off and the dead

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:30.930 
right way you could go off and the dead
ends<00:01:29.620> all<00:01:29.710> you<00:01:29.860> like<00:01:30.040> but<00:01:30.100> you<00:01:30.400> won't<00:01:30.550> get<00:01:30.760> any

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940 
ends all you like but you won't get any

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:55.620 
ends all you like but you won't get any
more<00:01:50.790> that's<00:01:51.790> the<00:01:51.970> next<00:01:52.150> evolve<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:55.270> get<00:01:55.420> there

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
more that's the next evolve to get there

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:17.240 
more that's the next evolve to get there
you<00:01:55.660> have<00:01:55.780> to<00:01:58.830> not<00:01:59.830> run<00:02:00.040> into<00:02:00.190> battles

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.350 

honestly<00:02:18.250> I<00:02:18.280> should<00:02:18.550> probably<00:02:18.670> just<00:02:19.000> start

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
honestly I should probably just start

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.479 
honestly I should probably just start
running<00:02:19.540> because<00:02:19.870> it's<00:02:20.050> not<00:02:20.170> worth<00:02:20.440> the<00:02:20.739> time

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
running because it's not worth the time

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:38.650 
running because it's not worth the time
it<00:02:21.700> takes<00:02:21.880> to<00:02:22.060> kill<00:02:22.270> them

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.020 

now<00:02:39.660> this<00:02:39.840> valve<00:02:40.140> shouldn't<00:02:40.770> be<00:02:41.030> dripping

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
now this valve shouldn't be dripping

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.120 
now this valve shouldn't be dripping
anything<00:02:42.480> is<00:02:42.690> if<00:02:42.870> you<00:02:43.110> close<00:02:43.350> the<00:02:43.500> two<00:02:43.680> valves

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
anything is if you close the two valves

00:02:44.130 --> 00:03:12.440 
anything is if you close the two valves
before<00:02:44.550> it<00:02:45.200> nor<00:02:46.200> should<00:02:46.380> this<00:02:46.560> one

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.229 

now<00:03:13.450> the<00:03:13.510> gate<00:03:14.079> will<00:03:14.230> be<00:03:14.260> locked<00:03:15.189> for<00:03:16.120> the

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
now the gate will be locked for the

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:17.819 
now the gate will be locked for the
first<00:03:16.420> time<00:03:16.599> we<00:03:16.750> come<00:03:16.900> here<00:03:17.109> lads<00:03:17.409> in<00:03:17.620> any

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829 
first time we come here lads in any

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:20.280 
first time we come here lads in any
dungeon<00:03:18.370> so<00:03:19.090> to<00:03:19.150> get<00:03:19.359> the<00:03:19.510> key<00:03:19.689> you<00:03:19.719> have<00:03:20.049> to<00:03:20.140> go

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
dungeon so to get the key you have to go

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:32.459 
dungeon so to get the key you have to go
up<00:03:20.469> here<00:03:30.120> at<00:03:31.120> least<00:03:31.450> I<00:03:31.569> think<00:03:31.629> that's<00:03:31.959> where<00:03:32.349> it

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:32.469 
up here at least I think that's where it

00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:35.729 
up here at least I think that's where it
is<00:03:32.590> I<00:03:32.769> can't<00:03:33.010> really<00:03:33.930> show<00:03:34.930> you<00:03:34.989> the<00:03:35.290> exact

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
is I can't really show you the exact

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:39.030 
is I can't really show you the exact
location<00:03:35.889> of<00:03:36.519> the<00:03:36.579> key<00:03:36.969> because<00:03:37.780> of<00:03:38.079> well<00:03:38.829> it's

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
location of the key because of well it's

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:45.390 
location of the key because of well it's
gone<00:03:42.989> but<00:03:43.989> just<00:03:44.200> take<00:03:44.590> my<00:03:44.739> word<00:03:44.950> for<00:03:45.189> it<00:03:45.250> it's

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
gone but just take my word for it it's

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.460 
gone but just take my word for it it's
either<00:03:45.579> up<00:03:45.760> here<00:03:46.150> or<00:03:46.329> I<00:03:46.659> know<00:03:46.989> it's<00:03:47.230> in<00:03:47.349> this

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
either up here or I know it's in this

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:57.360 
either up here or I know it's in this
room<00:03:47.530> i<00:03:47.950> do<00:03:48.010> if<00:03:49.000> i<00:03:49.150> recall<00:03:49.329> correctly<00:03:56.189> but<00:03:57.189> my

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
room i do if i recall correctly but my

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:09.860 
room i do if i recall correctly but my
memory<00:03:57.639> is<00:03:57.909> a<00:03:57.939> very<00:03:58.299> reliable<00:03:58.719> so

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.060 

unless<00:04:10.870> I've<00:04:11.050> done<00:04:11.230> it<00:04:11.380> over<00:04:11.500> a<00:04:11.620> thousand

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.070 
unless I've done it over a thousand

00:04:12.070 --> 00:05:16.900 
unless I've done it over a thousand
times<00:04:12.220> I<00:04:12.490> probably<00:04:12.640> won't<00:04:12.940> remember<00:04:13.120> it

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:21.320 

as<00:05:17.910> I<00:05:17.970> said<00:05:18.870> way<00:05:19.260> back<00:05:19.290> one<00:05:19.950> can<00:05:20.430> find<00:05:20.730> rare<00:05:21.060> mon

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
as I said way back one can find rare mon

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:29.360 
as I said way back one can find rare mon
after<00:05:21.720> you<00:05:21.810> beat<00:05:22.050> him<00:05:22.290> oh<00:05:27.950> you<00:05:28.950> only<00:05:29.160> need

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
after you beat him oh you only need

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:35.690 
after you beat him oh you only need
three<00:05:29.580> valves<00:05:29.940> what<00:05:30.270> do<00:05:30.330> you<00:05:30.420> know<00:05:34.190> well<00:05:35.190> this

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:35.700 
three valves what do you know well this

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.430 
three valves what do you know well this
is<00:05:35.820> where<00:05:36.120> the<00:05:36.240> boss<00:05:36.420> fight<00:05:36.690> would<00:05:36.840> be<00:05:36.990> so<00:05:37.260> I'm

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 
is where the boss fight would be so I'm

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.370 
is where the boss fight would be so I'm
guessing<00:05:38.420> that's<00:05:39.420> all<00:05:39.660> I<00:05:39.690> really<00:05:39.930> need<00:05:40.260> to

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:40.380 
guessing that's all I really need to

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:46.370 
guessing that's all I really need to
show<00:05:42.920> I'm<00:05:43.920> not<00:05:44.700> sure<00:05:44.760> the<00:05:45.180> exact<00:05:45.630> location<00:05:45.720> of

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.380 
show I'm not sure the exact location of

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.500 
show I'm not sure the exact location of
the<00:05:46.440> key<00:05:46.740> will<00:05:46.950> give<00:05:47.100> really<00:05:47.580> anyone<00:05:47.940> too<00:05:48.330> much

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:48.510 
the key will give really anyone too much

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:52.370 
the key will give really anyone too much
trouble<00:05:48.840> because<00:05:49.320> keys<00:05:49.740> usually<00:05:50.250> aren't<00:05:51.380> keys

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:52.380 
trouble because keys usually aren't keys

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:53.930
