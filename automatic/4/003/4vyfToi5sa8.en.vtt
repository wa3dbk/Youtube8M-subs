00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
it's going to be more calories now heat

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.030

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
have a thermometer great if not I just

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.560 
have a thermometer great if not I just
test<00:03:03.380> it<00:03:03.530> with<00:03:03.680> my<00:03:03.860> hand<00:03:04.160> and<00:03:04.519> see<00:03:04.670> how<00:03:05.090> hot<00:03:05.420> it

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
test it with my hand and see how hot it

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.360 
test it with my hand and see how hot it
is<00:03:05.600> and<00:03:05.930> that<00:03:06.080> usually<00:03:06.260> works<00:03:06.620> out<00:03:06.769> fine<00:03:07.010> for

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
is and that usually works out fine for

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.440 
is and that usually works out fine for
me

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
around in the carafe to give it a little

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.530 
around in the carafe to give it a little
smoother<00:03:16.320> texture<00:03:17.030> immediately<00:03:18.030> after<00:03:18.390> your

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
smoother texture immediately after your

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.380 
smoother texture immediately after your
froth<00:03:18.840> go<00:03:19.470> ahead<00:03:19.740> and<00:03:19.890> brew<00:03:20.070> your<00:03:20.250> espresso

00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:08.629 
milk you want try to get the temperature

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:11.259 
milk you want try to get the temperature
up<00:04:08.989> to<00:04:09.260> about<00:04:09.530> 160<00:04:10.189> degrees<00:04:10.219> and<00:04:10.879> you<00:04:11.090> want<00:04:11.209> to

keep<00:04:11.329> a<00:04:11.449> lot<00:04:11.599> of<00:04:11.659> movement<00:04:12.169> in<00:04:12.260> that<00:04:12.409> carafe<00:04:12.829> so

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
keep a lot of movement in that carafe so

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:14.890 
keep a lot of movement in that carafe so
if<00:04:13.430> you've<00:04:13.549> got<00:04:13.639> a<00:04:13.669> thermometer<00:04:14.209> that's<00:04:14.569> great

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:16.669 
if not you can just use your hand to

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:18.699 
if not you can just use your hand to
gauge<00:04:16.880> how<00:04:17.299> hot<00:04:17.570> it<00:04:17.720> is<00:04:17.840> and<00:04:18.139> that<00:04:18.590> always

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
gauge how hot it is and that always

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.409 
gauge how hot it is and that always
works<00:04:19.009> fine<00:04:19.220> for<00:04:19.250> me<00:04:19.579> and<00:04:19.880> then<00:04:20.209> the<00:04:20.269> most

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
works fine for me and then the most

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:22.749 
works fine for me and then the most
important<00:04:20.900> thing<00:04:20.930> is<00:04:21.289> you<00:04:21.470> want<00:04:21.500> to<00:04:21.769> froth

00:04:22.749 --> 00:04:22.759 
important thing is you want to froth

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:25.029 
important thing is you want to froth
your<00:04:22.970> milk<00:04:23.210> first<00:04:23.570> and<00:04:23.930> then<00:04:24.530> immediately

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:25.039 
your milk first and then immediately

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:27.070 
your milk first and then immediately
after<00:04:25.639> brewing<00:04:25.849> your<00:04:26.090> espresso<00:04:26.630> you<00:04:26.840> want<00:04:27.020> to

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
after brewing your espresso you want to

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.749 
after brewing your espresso you want to
combine<00:04:27.380> the<00:04:27.530> milk<00:04:27.740> in<00:04:28.099> the<00:04:28.220> espresso<00:04:28.520> that

00:04:28.749 --> 00:04:28.759 
combine the milk in the espresso that

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:30.909 
combine the milk in the espresso that
will<00:04:29.210> eliminate<00:04:29.479> the<00:04:29.780> bitterness<00:04:30.229> of<00:04:30.440> having

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919 
will eliminate the bitterness of having

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:33.670 
will eliminate the bitterness of having
that<00:04:31.070> espresso<00:04:31.310> sit<00:04:31.849> for<00:04:32.120> a<00:04:32.150> moment<00:04:32.330> now<00:04:33.229> that

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
that espresso sit for a moment now that

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.499 
that espresso sit for a moment now that
milk<00:04:34.009> is<00:04:34.190> also<00:04:34.340> going<00:04:34.639> to<00:04:34.699> tend<00:04:34.940> to<00:04:34.970> separate

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:35.509 
milk is also going to tend to separate

00:04:35.509 --> 00:04:38.230 
milk is also going to tend to separate
as<00:04:35.750> it<00:04:36.169> sits<00:04:36.409> there<00:04:36.680> so<00:04:36.979> ideally<00:04:37.669> the<00:04:37.789> faster

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
as it sits there so ideally the faster

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.730 
as it sits there so ideally the faster
you<00:04:38.360> can<00:04:38.479> combine<00:04:38.690> those<00:04:39.020> two<00:04:39.259> things<00:04:39.289> the

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
you can combine those two things the

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.260 
you can combine those two things the
better<00:04:39.949> now<00:04:40.610> we're<00:04:40.759> going<00:04:40.909> to<00:04:41.000> take<00:04:41.120> those

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
better now we're going to take those

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:42.850 
better now we're going to take those
techniques<00:04:41.690> and<00:04:41.960> going<00:04:42.110> to<00:04:42.169> apply<00:04:42.380> those<00:04:42.590> to

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
techniques and going to apply those to

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.200 
techniques and going to apply those to
our<00:04:42.889> closed-end<00:04:43.430> sprayer

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210
