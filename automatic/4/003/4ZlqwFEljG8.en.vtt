00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:13.740
 some tricks to make us last longer 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.650
 cosmetics or to recycle them 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.560
 Then if you want to watch this video 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.660

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.310

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.470

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.750

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.450
 none of my videos then now yes 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.179
 we go with the tricks sometimes it happens to us 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:35.280
 that we buy liquid eyeliners and not 

00:00:33.179 --> 00:00:37.980
 we like its consistency 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.589
 is very good does not last long in 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.010
 our eyelids or whatever then 

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:45.929
 there is some extra way to use it without 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.559
 have to throw it away what we're going to do 

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:52.620
 is to take your eyeliner of the tone that is 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.719
 and get the designs in your eyes by 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.900
 example you can do this design that I 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.750
 I have here then the mayor once 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.940
 you do draw this is a brush 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.309
 perfect to paint your ideas and 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.320
 then you put a transparent layer on top 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.420
 so that it lasts much more 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.850
 then cheer up and 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.130
 uses these liquid eyeliners that 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.409
 you did not like so many people not 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.720
 They use false eyelashes because they say 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:22.450
 it 's a big expense to be buying 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.030
 every time you want to use them it 's very 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.399
 expensive for them or they seem booty that 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.920
 is to throw away the money well then I'm going to 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:32.380
 teach that you can use the 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.869
 False eyelashes several times when 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.090
 you remove them for example I have a 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:40.060
 when you remove them from your eyes 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.340
 immediately put them to soak for 15 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.069
 minutes in warm water this will make the 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:48.310
 glue that is here is removed 

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:50.890
 easily when you no longer have glue 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.840
 then you leave them drying and the guards 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.090
 so you can use them in a next 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.429
 sometimes when time already we will 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.250
 finish our lip gloss that does not 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:02.470
 reaches to promise our lips or 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.990
 we already have another one because it's over but 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.090
 there is still the product then what 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.330
 What we can do is take a little 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.410
 of the balm and moisturize our 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.920
 cuticles 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:18.820
 seriously if you do this to finish 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:21.670
 your lip gloss will see how your 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:24.670
 cuticles hydrate your nails are going to 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.670
 see brighter and much more 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.510
 nice then cheer up to finish your 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.730
 lipgloss 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.010
 if you use these deodorants that are 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.410
 in roll then when it is finished what 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.440
 what you are going to do is take the ball and 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.630
 the sides very very well inside and what 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:44.560
 Let it dry when it has dried 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:47.890
 pour your favorite oil there and then 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:51.760
 obviously he does not let them pass you go back and 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:56.170
 you put the ball and you can massage yourself 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:58.260
 same the neck the shoulders the legs 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.910
 and you will see what a massager is 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.510
 spectacular that will go loosing little to 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:06.010
 little favorite oil and you will go 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.800
 removing those muscle pains that 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.740
 It has been perfuming you're hydrating 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.500
 and it relaxes you then you know how 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:17.060
 Make your own massager at home 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:21.000
 last when it's running out 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:23.310
 and is that the brush does not take it well or 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.860
 he's just sad and you have one 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.620
 again then for from some or that 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:31.290
 you're going to do you're going to take your shine from 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:35.280
 favorite lips with your finger takes with 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:39.150
 little ones then you take a little bit of your 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:42.350
 blog with the same finger unesa and what 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.350
 put on the lips 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:50.680
 look again, do it, take a little 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:53.550
 from the blog of the way to the lip gloss 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.550
 little bit of blogs 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:56.610
 to the lips 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:05.170
 so you have a new lip tone 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:11.049
 I think that according to the tone of the lip 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.420
 can be for example like this red more 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:17.229
 natural that it seems that your lips are 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:19.389
 of that tone and you will be able to use this 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:21.910
 product that you can no longer use in your 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:24.099
 cheeks the shadows are other of those 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.320
 cosmetics that you can use a thousand 

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:28.539
