00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
miles and this motor mount is shot I

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.240 
miles and this motor mount is shot I
could<00:00:41.780> grab<00:00:41.899> the<00:00:42.020> whole<00:00:42.170> motor<00:00:42.440> and<00:00:42.710> move<00:00:43.100> it

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
could grab the whole motor and move it

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.910 
could grab the whole motor and move it
back<00:00:43.280> and<00:00:43.610> forth<00:00:43.700> inside<00:00:44.239> the<00:00:44.390> sled<00:00:44.600> so<00:00:45.500> I<00:00:45.530> knew

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
back and forth inside the sled so I knew

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.150 
back and forth inside the sled so I knew
something<00:00:46.460> was<00:00:46.579> wrong<00:00:46.610> I<00:00:48.070> ordered<00:00:49.070> these

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
something was wrong I ordered these

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.069 
something was wrong I ordered these
motor<00:00:49.430> mounts<00:00:49.850> from<00:00:50.120> skidoo<00:00:50.510> and<00:00:50.780> these<00:00:50.960> are

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
motor mounts from skidoo and these are

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.220 
motor mounts from skidoo and these are
for<00:00:51.199> the<00:00:51.320> 440<00:00:52.010> race<00:00:52.370> model<00:00:52.930> so<00:00:53.930> this<00:00:54.050> should<00:00:54.199> be

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
for the 440 race model so this should be

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.610 
for the 440 race model so this should be
a<00:00:54.289> little<00:00:54.379> tougher<00:00:56.110> so<00:00:57.110> I<00:00:57.170> did<00:00:57.320> a<00:00:57.350> bunch<00:00:57.530> of

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:57.620 
a little tougher so I did a bunch of

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.500 
a little tougher so I did a bunch of
messing<00:00:57.949> around<00:00:58.039> tried<00:00:58.879> to<00:00:59.030> do<00:00:59.120> this<00:00:59.270> in<00:00:59.420> the

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
messing around tried to do this in the

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.990 
messing around tried to do this in the
vise<00:00:59.690> it<00:01:00.410> can<00:01:00.649> be<00:01:00.859> done<00:01:01.039> but<00:01:01.579> it's<00:01:01.760> a<00:01:01.879> little

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
vise it can be done but it's a little

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.229 
vise it can be done but it's a little
tricky<00:01:02.710> instead<00:01:03.710> talking<00:01:04.519> with<00:01:04.640> Keeley<00:01:05.000> here

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
tricky instead talking with Keeley here

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.090 
tricky instead talking with Keeley here
the<00:01:05.449> man<00:01:05.600> behind<00:01:05.840> the<00:01:05.990> camera<00:01:06.170> we<00:01:06.770> came<00:01:06.950> up

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
the man behind the camera we came up

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.859 
the man behind the camera we came up
with<00:01:07.250> an<00:01:07.340> idea<00:01:07.640> more<00:01:08.060> or<00:01:08.180> less<00:01:08.360> to<00:01:08.539> just<00:01:08.750> heat

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
with an idea more or less to just heat

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.469 
with an idea more or less to just heat
up<00:01:08.990> this<00:01:09.110> aluminum<00:01:09.560> it's<00:01:09.950> gonna<00:01:10.190> expand<00:01:10.700> it'll

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
up this aluminum it's gonna expand it'll

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:13.540 
up this aluminum it's gonna expand it'll
loosen<00:01:11.630> up<00:01:11.840> this<00:01:12.080> motor<00:01:12.740> mount<00:01:13.009> quite<00:01:13.310> a<00:01:13.340> bit

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550 
loosen up this motor mount quite a bit

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:14.290 
loosen up this motor mount quite a bit
and<00:01:13.670> then<00:01:13.759> we're<00:01:13.849> just<00:01:13.880> gonna<00:01:14.060> use<00:01:14.270> a

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:14.300 
and then we're just gonna use a

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.070 
and then we're just gonna use a
pneumatic<00:01:14.539> airgun<00:01:15.050> to<00:01:15.200> just<00:01:15.380> drive<00:01:15.860> it<00:01:16.009> out<00:01:16.160> so

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
pneumatic airgun to just drive it out so

00:01:17.080 --> 00:02:15.059 
pneumatic airgun to just drive it out so
it<00:01:18.080> actually<00:01:18.380> works<00:01:18.530> pretty<00:01:18.740> easily

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.589 

we<00:02:16.069> made<00:02:16.220> a<00:02:16.250> bit<00:02:16.400> of<00:02:16.430> a<00:02:16.549> spacer<00:02:17.000> here<00:02:17.030> and<00:02:17.450> we

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:17.599 
we made a bit of a spacer here and we

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:19.720 
we made a bit of a spacer here and we
just<00:02:17.780> used<00:02:17.930> this<00:02:18.049> old<00:02:18.230> bearing<00:02:18.709> off<00:02:18.980> one<00:02:19.610> of

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
just used this old bearing off one of

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.960 
just used this old bearing off one of
Keeley's<00:02:19.879> sleds<00:02:20.239> that<00:02:20.330> he<00:02:20.480> broke<00:02:20.690> and<00:02:21.970> it's

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
Keeley's sleds that he broke and it's

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.759 
Keeley's sleds that he broke and it's
gonna<00:02:23.150> push<00:02:23.390> on<00:02:23.540> this<00:02:23.690> middle<00:02:23.900> little<00:02:24.500> metal

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
gonna push on this middle little metal

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:26.380 
gonna push on this middle little metal
mount<00:02:25.040> instead<00:02:25.519> of<00:02:25.670> the<00:02:25.819> rubber<00:02:26.000> mount<00:02:26.269> so

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
mount instead of the rubber mount so

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:27.369 
mount instead of the rubber mount so
let's<00:02:26.540> see<00:02:26.750> if<00:02:26.840> that<00:02:26.959> works

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:27.379 
let's see if that works

00:02:27.379 --> 00:03:05.229 
let's see if that works
a<00:03:00.640> little<00:03:01.640> bit<00:03:01.760> more<00:03:01.910> I<00:03:03.880> need<00:03:04.880> to<00:03:05.000> eat<00:03:05.090> my

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
a little bit more I need to eat my

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:07.720 
a little bit more I need to eat my
Wheaties<00:03:05.980> and<00:03:06.980> the<00:03:07.130> weight<00:03:07.280> to<00:03:07.430> put<00:03:07.579> behind

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
Wheaties and the weight to put behind

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:15.569 
Wheaties and the weight to put behind
that<00:03:12.639> if<00:03:13.639> that<00:03:13.880> were<00:03:14.000> just<00:03:14.209> a<00:03:14.299> little<00:03:14.569> smaller

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579 
that if that were just a little smaller

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:23.540 
that if that were just a little smaller
not<00:03:16.579> bearing<00:03:16.970> it<00:03:17.090> would<00:03:17.209> be<00:03:17.329> just<00:03:17.569> perfect

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:32.390 

that's<00:03:30.500> okay<00:03:31.500> now<00:03:31.650> I<00:03:31.680> just<00:03:31.740> have<00:03:31.980> to<00:03:32.070> press<00:03:32.220> out
