 instead introduces cities here could be the German 

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:20.329
 but we think that was well done 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:25.829
 because of several countries in the Ãœberlinger have 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:28.829
 ready next to a turn 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:32.560
 208 pages 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.460
 since May in the streets because the whole has it slowing down on this first 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:38.240
 Curve 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.580
 in Portugal 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.050
 past the place where there are many walkers effort Berlin dapd 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.420
 the resume rain 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.810
 Peter Sagan down the hill 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.700
 Some people do it in a non-owner of the mountain's brake in the shelter 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:52.290
 centime 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.540
 I know his money in this mix already switched the year before because 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:57.850
 the winter break 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.410
 it is still wet place on the asphalt 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.410
 the acceleration remains and immediately throw on these links 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.040
 what about the APA explained 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.330
 far away from the place and again like 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.140
 now that he's a guest 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.780
 Jon Mettler 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.860
 June invited the little St 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.860
 Fire had passed through the area 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.850
 from Eberhard the brakes 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:21.950
 and 8 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.780
 three courses in this long 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.080
 Daimler also on the body 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.700
 phase out 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.750
 and now very emotional 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.630
 Rolfes Reinecke race 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.410
 because who Heidi Monday 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.900
 Weinheim Longhorns make small and again on the brakes 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.630
 Greased Napier Simoncelli 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.800
 as well as it puts on this market as well as salt 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.480
 short break diarrhea the respective selection has been driving from now on 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.600
 this mountain on VOX Euro 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.600
 there is my cameraman 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.550
 the crest is also here again on the gas 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.720
 and there you have to pay attention to do a lot again right over command for 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.660
 Attacks are flipping 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:04.840
 the vet 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.410
 with a lot of feeling and experience became scarce 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.319
 a long walk is enough 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.150
 I'm racing for safety reasons the track is not right yet 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.619
 really dry 

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:17.039
 now only in the form of changing guest lecturer 

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:20.519
 Franconia 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:23.519
 according to the authorities 

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:28.039
 Canada will 

00:02:29.889 --> 00:02:31.769
 long pretty demanding 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.180
 to miss
