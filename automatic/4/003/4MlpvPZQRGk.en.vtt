you<00:02:17.599> see<00:02:17.810> right<00:02:18.020> now<00:02:18.050> is<00:02:18.230> a<00:02:19.130> very<00:02:19.670> manicured

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
you see right now is a very manicured

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.839 
you see right now is a very manicured
shaped<00:02:20.840> site<00:02:21.260> and<00:02:21.950> we're<00:02:22.130> gonna<00:02:22.250> get<00:02:22.459> ready<00:02:22.670> to

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:22.849 
shaped site and we're gonna get ready to

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:24.420 
shaped site and we're gonna get ready to
put<00:02:23.060> Shore<00:02:23.390> in<00:02:23.540> beams<00:02:23.780> here

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
put Shore in beams here

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.970 
put Shore in beams here
on<00:02:24.489> the<00:02:24.939> four<00:02:25.239> sides<00:02:25.540> of<00:02:25.720> the<00:02:25.840> hospital<00:02:26.739> that

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
on the four sides of the hospital that

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.490 
on the four sides of the hospital that
way<00:02:27.189> it'll<00:02:27.519> allow<00:02:27.790> excavation<00:02:28.629> via<00:02:28.840> sheer<00:02:29.200> cut

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
way it'll allow excavation via sheer cut

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.970 
way it'll allow excavation via sheer cut
straight<00:02:29.829> down<00:02:30.069> about<00:02:30.610> 35<00:02:31.390> feet<00:02:31.689> or<00:02:31.870> so<00:02:32.079> and

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
straight down about 35 feet or so and

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.880 
straight down about 35 feet or so and
then<00:02:33.220> the<00:02:33.610> earthwork<00:02:34.120> starts<00:02:34.709> that'll<00:02:35.709> take

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
then the earthwork starts that'll take

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.850 
then the earthwork starts that'll take
us<00:02:36.040> out<00:02:36.250> to<00:02:36.280> around<00:02:36.939> october/november<00:02:37.840> and<00:02:38.739> at

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
us out to around october/november and at

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.920 
us out to around october/november and at
that<00:02:39.040> point<00:02:39.370> we<00:02:39.909> start<00:02:40.239> stalling<00:02:40.840> the

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
that point we start stalling the

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.130 
that point we start stalling the
foundations<00:02:41.739> these<00:02:42.370> foundations<00:02:43.120> are<00:02:43.390> piles

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
foundations these foundations are piles

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.740 
foundations these foundations are piles
that<00:02:44.620> we're<00:02:44.739> gonna<00:02:44.829> drill<00:02:45.189> down<00:02:45.430> 70<00:02:46.209> feet<00:02:46.480> from

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
that we're gonna drill down 70 feet from

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.670 
that we're gonna drill down 70 feet from
the<00:02:46.930> bottom<00:02:47.170> of<00:02:47.439> the<00:02:47.500> elevation<00:02:48.180> we<00:02:49.180> have<00:02:49.680> 1300

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
the bottom of the elevation we have 1300

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.740 
the bottom of the elevation we have 1300
of<00:02:50.739> those<00:02:50.920> piles<00:02:51.189> to<00:02:51.400> put<00:02:51.579> in<00:02:51.670> place<00:02:51.970> and

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
of those piles to put in place and

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.509 
of those piles to put in place and
that's<00:02:53.140> probably<00:02:53.349> going<00:02:53.470> to<00:02:53.620> take<00:02:53.680> about<00:02:54.040> six

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
that's probably going to take about six

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.059 
that's probably going to take about six
months<00:02:54.849> or<00:02:54.970> so<00:02:55.150> then<00:02:56.019> we<00:02:56.409> start<00:02:56.680> building<00:02:56.739> the

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
months or so then we start building the

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:59.670 
months or so then we start building the
concrete<00:02:57.519> foundations<00:02:58.090> on<00:02:58.239> top<00:02:58.480> of<00:02:58.720> those<00:02:58.870> we

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
concrete foundations on top of those we

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.099 
concrete foundations on top of those we
set<00:02:59.950> the<00:03:00.099> base<00:03:00.310> Isolators<00:03:01.090> these<00:03:01.870> base

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:02.109 
set the base Isolators these base

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:04.680 
set the base Isolators these base
Isolators<00:03:02.799> will<00:03:03.489> allow<00:03:03.819> this<00:03:04.120> building<00:03:04.569> to

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
Isolators will allow this building to

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.699 
Isolators will allow this building to
move<00:03:04.900> up<00:03:05.260> to<00:03:05.530> six<00:03:06.069> feet<00:03:06.400> and<00:03:06.730> an<00:03:07.209> earthquake

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
move up to six feet and an earthquake

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.289 
move up to six feet and an earthquake
take<00:03:08.709> about<00:03:08.889> five<00:03:09.189> months<00:03:09.459> to<00:03:09.849> set<00:03:10.120> the

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
take about five months to set the

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:12.000 
take about five months to set the
skeleton<00:03:10.930> all<00:03:11.049> the<00:03:11.170> structural<00:03:11.620> steel<00:03:11.829> in

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
skeleton all the structural steel in

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.819 
skeleton all the structural steel in
place<00:03:12.299> then<00:03:13.299> at<00:03:13.599> that<00:03:13.810> point<00:03:14.079> we<00:03:14.200> start<00:03:14.470> clad

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829 
place then at that point we start clad

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:16.470 
place then at that point we start clad
in<00:03:15.069> the<00:03:15.159> building<00:03:15.579> that'll<00:03:15.819> take<00:03:15.970> another<00:03:16.060> six

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
in the building that'll take another six

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.199 
in the building that'll take another six
to<00:03:16.569> eight<00:03:16.689> months<00:03:16.930> and<00:03:17.230> then<00:03:18.010> interior<00:03:18.790> work

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
to eight months and then interior work

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:20.670 
to eight months and then interior work
is<00:03:19.389> started<00:03:19.810> so<00:03:19.900> we're<00:03:20.049> starting<00:03:20.200> to<00:03:20.409> do<00:03:20.530> all

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
is started so we're starting to do all

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.679 
is started so we're starting to do all
the<00:03:20.799> drywall<00:03:21.099> the<00:03:21.819> ceilings<00:03:22.359> and<00:03:22.480> then<00:03:22.599> the

00:03:22.679 --> 00:03:22.689 
the drywall the ceilings and then the

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:24.780 
the drywall the ceilings and then the
finishes<00:03:23.230> that'll<00:03:23.950> take<00:03:24.159> us<00:03:24.310> to<00:03:24.459> about<00:03:24.609> the

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
finishes that'll take us to about the

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.530 
finishes that'll take us to about the
end<00:03:25.090> of<00:03:25.319> 2016<00:03:26.319> at<00:03:27.159> that<00:03:27.400> point<00:03:27.730> we<00:03:28.239> start

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
end of 2016 at that point we start

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.860 
end of 2016 at that point we start
testing<00:03:28.810> out<00:03:29.109> all<00:03:29.349> the<00:03:29.530> systems<00:03:30.069> and<00:03:30.870> we're

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
testing out all the systems and we're

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.020 
testing out all the systems and we're
done<00:03:32.199> essentially<00:03:33.160> by<00:03:33.400> around<00:03:33.790> April<00:03:34.449> of<00:03:34.949> 2017

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
done essentially by around April of 2017

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.210 
done essentially by around April of 2017
that's<00:03:37.030> when<00:03:37.389> the<00:03:37.599> real<00:03:37.959> work<00:03:38.319> starts<00:03:38.530> that<00:03:39.069> we

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
that's when the real work starts that we

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.189 
that's when the real work starts that we
have<00:03:39.370> to<00:03:39.519> start<00:03:39.699> transitioning<00:03:40.209> to<00:03:40.989> be<00:03:41.169> a

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:41.199 
have to start transitioning to be a

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:43.199 
have to start transitioning to be a
hospital<00:03:42.069> so<00:03:42.519> everything's<00:03:43.000> going<00:03:43.060> to<00:03:43.150> be

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
hospital so everything's going to be

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:45.300 
hospital so everything's going to be
trained<00:03:43.569> on<00:03:43.959> how<00:03:44.319> the<00:03:44.379> phones<00:03:44.769> are<00:03:44.980> gonna<00:03:45.040> work

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
trained on how the phones are gonna work

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.119 
trained on how the phones are gonna work
the<00:03:45.489> computer<00:03:46.060> systems<00:03:46.659> how<00:03:47.199> healthcare<00:03:47.980> is

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:48.129 
the computer systems how healthcare is

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:51.449 
the computer systems how healthcare is
going<00:03:48.310> to<00:03:48.370> be<00:03:48.489> delivered<00:03:49.030> in<00:03:49.209> the<00:03:49.750> future<00:03:50.459> this
