have<00:00:09.929> been<00:00:10.019> asking<00:00:10.200> me<00:00:10.440> a<00:00:10.530> lot<00:00:10.800> it's<00:00:10.980> about<00:00:11.190> the

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
have been asking me a lot it's about the

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.669 
have been asking me a lot it's about the
castle<00:00:11.849> Andy<00:00:12.300> generals<00:00:12.840> so<00:00:13.230> let's<00:00:13.440> go<00:00:13.559> ahead

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
castle Andy generals so let's go ahead

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:14.629 
castle Andy generals so let's go ahead
and<00:00:13.860> take<00:00:13.980> a<00:00:14.009> look<00:00:14.190> at<00:00:14.309> that

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
and take a look at that

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.689 
and take a look at that
so<00:00:15.120> my<00:00:15.450> generals<00:00:16.020> currently<00:00:16.680> are<00:00:16.890> Alexander

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
so my generals currently are Alexander

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.880 
so my generals currently are Alexander
which<00:00:17.850> is<00:00:18.000> active<00:00:18.539> and<00:00:18.779> you<00:00:18.960> have<00:00:19.109> Cleopatra

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
which is active and you have Cleopatra

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.710 
which is active and you have Cleopatra
so<00:00:20.039> we<00:00:20.670> also<00:00:20.760> have<00:00:20.939> these<00:00:21.060> other<00:00:21.119> two<00:00:21.449> generals

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
so we also have these other two generals

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.750 
so we also have these other two generals
right<00:00:21.840> here<00:00:21.990> Nobunaga<00:00:22.680> and<00:00:22.859> then<00:00:23.490> we<00:00:23.640> also

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
right here Nobunaga and then we also

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.890 
right here Nobunaga and then we also
have<00:00:24.060> Napoleon

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
have Napoleon

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.570 
have Napoleon
so<00:00:25.199> Napoleon<00:00:25.710> is<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:25.949> different<00:00:26.369> type<00:00:26.550> of

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
so Napoleon is a different type of

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.220 
so Napoleon is a different type of
general<00:00:27.090> compared<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.720> other<00:00:27.930> three

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
general compared to the other three

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.620 
general compared to the other three
because<00:00:28.590> he<00:00:28.710> has<00:00:28.800> very<00:00:29.039> low<00:00:29.250> hitpoints<00:00:29.630> but

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
because he has very low hitpoints but

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.410 
because he has very low hitpoints but
he's<00:00:30.810> got<00:00:30.960> 230<00:00:31.650> damage<00:00:31.980> per<00:00:32.189> second<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:32.640> 690

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
he's got 230 damage per second and 690

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.880 
he's got 230 damage per second and 690
against<00:00:33.719> defenders<00:00:34.079> so<00:00:34.200> he<00:00:34.320> has<00:00:34.410> very<00:00:34.680> very

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
against defenders so he has very very

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.190 
against defenders so he has very very
high<00:00:35.160> damage<00:00:35.730> but<00:00:36.270> he<00:00:36.360> has<00:00:36.480> very<00:00:36.660> low<00:00:36.930> health

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
high damage but he has very low health

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.020 
high damage but he has very low health
so<00:00:37.590> he<00:00:37.829> will<00:00:37.950> go<00:00:38.070> down<00:00:38.250> pretty<00:00:38.399> fast<00:00:38.640> compared

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
so he will go down pretty fast compared

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.150 
so he will go down pretty fast compared
to<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.210> other<00:00:39.360> ones<00:00:39.600> see<00:00:40.200> though<00:00:40.379> bonaga<00:00:40.739> here

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
to the other ones see though bonaga here

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.180

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
can do it once in a while it's pretty

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.139 
can do it once in a while it's pretty
cheap<00:00:58.859> only<00:00:59.070> takes<00:00:59.340> 8<00:00:59.520> hours<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.879> do<00:01:00.000> it

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
cheap only takes 8 hours to do it

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.479 
cheap only takes 8 hours to do it
but<00:01:00.660> my<00:01:01.199> point<00:01:01.469> right<00:01:01.590> now<00:01:01.649> here<00:01:01.980> is<00:01:02.250> that

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
but my point right now here is that

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.399 
but my point right now here is that
Napoleon<00:01:03.000> is<00:01:03.149> gonna<00:01:03.480> be<00:01:03.600> different<00:01:03.960> than<00:01:04.260> the

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
Napoleon is gonna be different than the

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.929 
Napoleon is gonna be different than the
other<00:01:04.439> three<00:01:04.619> generals<00:01:05.189> because<00:01:05.519> he<00:01:05.729> does<00:01:05.880> a

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
other three generals because he does a

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.030 
other three generals because he does a
lot<00:01:06.150> of<00:01:06.210> damage<00:01:06.479> but<00:01:06.900> he<00:01:07.020> has<00:01:07.110> half<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.619> health

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
lot of damage but he has half the health

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.850 
lot of damage but he has half the health
of<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.310> other<00:01:08.430> generals<00:01:08.909> so<00:01:09.380> basically<00:01:10.380> how<00:01:10.830> I

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
of the other generals so basically how I

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.750 
of the other generals so basically how I
use<00:01:11.280> Cleopatra<00:01:12.619> Alexander<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:13.830> Nobunaga<00:01:14.340> I

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
use Cleopatra Alexander and Nobunaga I

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.789 
use Cleopatra Alexander and Nobunaga I
use<00:01:15.180> them<00:01:15.360> as<00:01:15.509> tanks<00:01:15.990> because<00:01:16.320> they<00:01:16.470> have<00:01:16.560> so

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
use them as tanks because they have so

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.620 
use them as tanks because they have so
much<00:01:16.950> health<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:17.549> mean<00:01:18.000> let's<00:01:18.270> take<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.420> look<00:01:18.570> at

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
much health I mean let's take a look at

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.700 
much health I mean let's take a look at
Alexander<00:01:18.840> right<00:01:19.200> now<00:01:19.290> he's<00:01:19.409> got<00:01:19.500> ten

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
Alexander right now he's got ten

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.230 
Alexander right now he's got ten
thousand<00:01:20.009> nine<00:01:20.130> hundred<00:01:20.310> eighty<00:01:20.640> damage<00:01:21.090> per

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
thousand nine hundred eighty damage per

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.020 
thousand nine hundred eighty damage per
second<00:01:21.600> 240<00:01:22.500> he<00:01:22.619> has<00:01:22.710> decent<00:01:23.159> damage<00:01:23.369> but<00:01:23.909> the

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
second 240 he has decent damage but the

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.999 
second 240 he has decent damage but the
main<00:01:24.270> purpose<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:24.869> these<00:01:25.080> guys<00:01:25.320> are<00:01:25.590> basically

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
main purpose of these guys are basically

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.130 
main purpose of these guys are basically
like<00:01:26.280> Knights<00:01:26.580> so<00:01:27.150> if<00:01:27.240> I<00:01:27.360> was<00:01:27.540> ever<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.869> use

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
like Knights so if I was ever to use

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.899 
like Knights so if I was ever to use
generals<00:01:28.710> in<00:01:28.799> an<00:01:28.920> attack<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.430> would<00:01:29.610> always<00:01:29.790> use

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
generals in an attack I would always use

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.060 
generals in an attack I would always use
them<00:01:30.210> as<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.299> tank<00:01:30.630> because<00:01:31.079> he<00:01:31.259> would<00:01:31.380> be<00:01:31.530> taken

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
them as a tank because he would be taken

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.069 
them as a tank because he would be taken
and<00:01:32.220> all<00:01:32.909> that<00:01:33.090> damage<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.600> ten<00:01:33.750> thousand

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
and all that damage and ten thousand

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.960 
and all that damage and ten thousand
health<00:01:34.259> is<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.409> lot<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:35.009> take<00:01:35.189> that's<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.610> lot<00:01:35.790> of

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
health is a lot to take that's a lot of

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.600 
health is a lot to take that's a lot of
damage<00:01:36.180> taken<00:01:36.840> now<00:01:37.470> this<00:01:37.740> is<00:01:37.860> my<00:01:37.979> opinion<00:01:38.280> on

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
damage taken now this is my opinion on

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.210 
damage taken now this is my opinion on
generals<00:01:39.299> I<00:01:39.540> don't<00:01:40.439> like<00:01:40.710> using<00:01:41.070> them<00:01:41.189> for

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
generals I don't like using them for

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.069 
generals I don't like using them for
attack<00:01:41.729> you<00:01:42.000> can<00:01:42.119> also<00:01:42.270> use<00:01:42.479> them<00:01:42.600> for<00:01:42.630> defense

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
attack you can also use them for defense

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.749 
attack you can also use them for defense
as<00:01:43.259> well<00:01:43.439> I<00:01:43.649> don't<00:01:44.159> like<00:01:44.280> using<00:01:44.430> them<00:01:44.729> for

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
as well I don't like using them for

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.210 
as well I don't like using them for
attack<00:01:45.210> is<00:01:45.390> because<00:01:45.750> you<00:01:45.990> can<00:01:46.200> only<00:01:46.590> use<00:01:47.100> them

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
attack is because you can only use them

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.880 
attack is because you can only use them
once<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.880> then<00:01:48.060> they'll<00:01:48.270> go<00:01:48.479> ahead<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.890> have

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
once and then they'll go ahead and have

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.950 
once and then they'll go ahead and have
to<00:01:50.040> heal<00:01:50.220> up<00:01:50.460> so<00:01:50.670> if<00:01:50.729> they<00:01:50.850> take<00:01:51.090> any<00:01:51.270> damage<00:01:51.570> in

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
to heal up so if they take any damage in

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.130 
to heal up so if they take any damage in
the<00:01:52.649> battle<00:01:53.090> therein<00:01:54.090> they<00:01:54.689> will<00:01:54.840> have<00:01:55.020> to

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
the battle therein they will have to

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.920 
the battle therein they will have to
heal<00:01:55.320> up<00:01:55.500> so<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:55.860> will<00:01:55.979> take<00:01:56.250> between<00:01:56.520> 1<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.420> 24

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
heal up so it will take between 1 to 24

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.389 
heal up so it will take between 1 to 24
hours<00:01:58.259> so<00:01:58.409> if<00:01:58.469> they're<00:01:58.649> dead<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.159> will<00:01:59.219> take

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
hours so if they're dead it will take

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.179 
hours so if they're dead it will take
them<00:01:59.520> an<00:01:59.610> entire<00:01:59.729> damn<00:02:00.180> day<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.689> revive<00:02:01.290> up<00:02:01.500> but

them an entire damn day to revive up but

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.889 
them an entire damn day to revive up but
you'll<00:02:02.399> have<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.700> second<00:02:03.090> general<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.600> once

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
you'll have a second general and once

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.630 
you'll have a second general and once
you<00:02:04.020> have<00:02:04.140> multiple<00:02:04.530> generals<00:02:05.070> you<00:02:05.460> can

you have multiple generals you can

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.850 
you have multiple generals you can
actually<00:02:05.820> frequently<00:02:06.570> use<00:02:06.780> these<00:02:07.409> guys<00:02:07.619> to

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
probably you could even just take one

in an attack and after 12 hours you can

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.160 
in an attack and after 12 hours you can
use<00:02:43.580> them<00:02:43.730> again<00:02:43.940> for<00:02:44.120> defense<00:02:44.420> of<00:02:44.570> course<00:02:44.780> and

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.140 
use them again for defense of course and
you<00:02:45.500> can<00:02:45.560> also<00:02:45.770> switch<00:02:46.220> up<00:02:46.490> your<00:02:46.550> generals

but<00:02:58.910> basically<00:02:59.240> in<00:02:59.510> defense<00:03:00.230> this<00:03:00.410> is<00:03:00.470> what

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
but basically in defense this is what

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.560 
but basically in defense this is what
happens<00:03:01.070> if<00:03:01.370> anyone<00:03:01.760> comes<00:03:01.940> in<00:03:02.150> close<00:03:02.360> to<00:03:02.480> the

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
happens if anyone comes in close to the

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.390 
happens if anyone comes in close to the
castle<00:03:02.750> range<00:03:03.140> somewhere<00:03:03.890> around<00:03:03.980> the<00:03:04.220> map

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
castle range somewhere around the map

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.730 
castle range somewhere around the map
around<00:03:04.790> the<00:03:05.060> castle<00:03:05.480> the<00:03:05.960> general<00:03:06.350> will<00:03:06.500> pop

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740 
around the castle the general will pop

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.760 
around the castle the general will pop
up<00:03:06.770> and<00:03:07.160> they<00:03:07.520> attack<00:03:07.940> the<00:03:08.210> units<00:03:08.540> that<00:03:08.630> are

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
up and they attack the units that are

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.320 
up and they attack the units that are
coming<00:03:09.770> in<00:03:09.890> at<00:03:09.980> the<00:03:10.100> castle<00:03:10.520> or<00:03:10.910> anywhere

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
coming in at the castle or anywhere

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.570 
coming in at the castle or anywhere
around<00:03:11.450> the<00:03:11.720> castle<00:03:11.900> here<00:03:12.200> so<00:03:12.440> the<00:03:12.650> the<00:03:13.310> kill

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
around the castle here so the the kill

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.330 
around the castle here so the the kill
Cleopatra<00:03:14.270> or<00:03:14.450> Alexander<00:03:15.190> Napoleon<00:03:16.190> or

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
Cleopatra or Alexander Napoleon or

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.910 
Cleopatra or Alexander Napoleon or
Nobunaga<00:03:17.330> any<00:03:17.480> of<00:03:17.570> these<00:03:17.690> generals<00:03:18.080> also<00:03:18.709> act

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
Nobunaga any of these generals also act

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.120 
Nobunaga any of these generals also act
as<00:03:19.100> a<00:03:19.520> sort<00:03:20.120> of<00:03:20.180> a<00:03:20.300> general<00:03:20.780> night<00:03:21.320> defense<00:03:21.890> as

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
as a sort of a general night defense as

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.860 
as a sort of a general night defense as
well<00:03:22.310> so<00:03:22.490> that's<00:03:22.700> very<00:03:22.910> very<00:03:23.209> good<00:03:23.360> as<00:03:23.480> well<00:03:23.630> so

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
well so that's very very good as well so

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.960 
well so that's very very good as well so
the<00:03:24.260> castle<00:03:24.709> is<00:03:24.830> very<00:03:24.890> helpful<00:03:25.340> in<00:03:25.730> fact

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
the castle is very helpful in fact

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.000 
the castle is very helpful in fact
because<00:03:26.300> they<00:03:26.630> have<00:03:26.780> generals<00:03:27.260> whoops<00:03:27.770> and

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
because they have generals whoops and

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.710 
because they have generals whoops and
they<00:03:28.400> also<00:03:28.520> have<00:03:28.760> very<00:03:29.000> good<00:03:29.150> attack<00:03:29.450> as<00:03:29.600> well

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
they also have very good attack as well

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:30.850 
they also have very good attack as well
let's<00:03:29.930> go<00:03:30.050> ahead<00:03:30.260> and<00:03:30.380> just<00:03:30.500> take<00:03:30.590> a<00:03:30.680> look<00:03:30.740> at

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
let's go ahead and just take a look at

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.970 
let's go ahead and just take a look at
the<00:03:30.920> castle<00:03:31.190> they<00:03:31.310> have<00:03:31.430> 5,800<00:03:32.390> hit<00:03:32.480> points

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
the castle they have 5,800 hit points

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.110 
the castle they have 5,800 hit points
275<00:03:33.980> damage<00:03:34.280> per<00:03:34.400> second<00:03:34.730> so<00:03:34.820> basically

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
275 damage per second so basically

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.300 
275 damage per second so basically
they're<00:03:35.390> just<00:03:35.660> like<00:03:35.980> watchtowers<00:03:36.980> I<00:03:37.130> guess

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
they're just like watchtowers I guess

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.190 
they're just like watchtowers I guess
but<00:03:37.850> they<00:03:38.000> have<00:03:38.150> a<00:03:38.180> lot<00:03:38.510> of<00:03:38.540> hit<00:03:38.750> points<00:03:39.050> and<00:03:39.110> a

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
but they have a lot of hit points and a

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.930 
but they have a lot of hit points and a
lot<00:03:39.230> of<00:03:39.380> people<00:03:39.740> are<00:03:39.980> reluctant<00:03:40.250> and<00:03:40.760> it'll

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
lot of people are reluctant and it'll

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.810 
lot of people are reluctant and it'll
probably<00:03:41.239> not<00:03:41.510> attack<00:03:41.959> your<00:03:42.200> base<00:03:42.380> on<00:03:42.680> on<00:03:43.430> this

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820 
probably not attack your base on on this

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.040 
probably not attack your base on on this
kind<00:03:44.090> of<00:03:44.180> flank<00:03:44.420> you<00:03:44.540> know<00:03:44.630> they'll<00:03:44.810> probably

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.050 
kind of flank you know they'll probably

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:46.930 
kind of flank you know they'll probably
I<00:03:45.290> have<00:03:45.500> barely<00:03:45.800> had<00:03:45.950> anybody<00:03:46.340> attack<00:03:46.760> from

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
I have barely had anybody attack from

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.520 
I have barely had anybody attack from
this<00:03:47.150> side<00:03:47.360> because<00:03:47.780> I<00:03:47.810> have<00:03:47.989> a<00:03:48.020> castle<00:03:48.440> right

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
this side because I have a castle right

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.220 
this side because I have a castle right
here<00:03:48.770> so<00:03:49.220> your<00:03:49.489> castle<00:03:49.970> does<00:03:50.480> act<00:03:50.750> as<00:03:50.900> a<00:03:50.930> very

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
here so your castle does act as a very

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.620 
here so your castle does act as a very
great<00:03:51.530> fortress<00:03:52.130> that<00:03:52.459> kind<00:03:52.880> of<00:03:52.970> blocks<00:03:53.300> where

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
great fortress that kind of blocks where

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:55.180 
great fortress that kind of blocks where
people<00:03:53.989> want<00:03:54.170> to<00:03:54.230> attack<00:03:54.470> they<00:03:54.680> never<00:03:54.950> usually

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
people want to attack they never usually

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:56.620 
people want to attack they never usually
attack<00:03:55.580> on<00:03:55.790> this<00:03:55.940> side<00:03:56.120> because<00:03:56.270> I<00:03:56.480> have<00:03:56.570> a

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
attack on this side because I have a

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:57.940 
attack on this side because I have a
castle<00:03:57.020> here<00:03:57.170> they<00:03:57.350> just<00:03:57.380> don't<00:03:57.709> think<00:03:57.860> it's

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
castle here they just don't think it's

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.280 
castle here they just don't think it's
worth<00:03:58.100> it<00:03:58.370> so<00:03:58.940> the<00:03:59.180> castle<00:03:59.540> does<00:03:59.750> act<00:04:00.050> as<00:04:00.170> a

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
worth it so the castle does act as a

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.170 
worth it so the castle does act as a
great<00:04:00.530> defensive<00:04:01.040> buffer<00:04:01.370> plus<00:04:01.940> you<00:04:02.060> get

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
great defensive buffer plus you get

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.240 
great defensive buffer plus you get
generals<00:04:02.630> for<00:04:02.989> attack<00:04:03.350> and<00:04:03.380> defense<00:04:03.860> now<00:04:04.220> I

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
generals for attack and defense now I

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:05.620 
generals for attack and defense now I
would<00:04:04.520> probably<00:04:04.700> use<00:04:04.880> my<00:04:05.150> generals<00:04:05.510> for

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
would probably use my generals for

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.600 
would probably use my generals for
defense<00:04:06.050> I've<00:04:06.290> barely<00:04:06.709> used<00:04:07.040> my<00:04:07.190> generals<00:04:07.520> for

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
defense I've barely used my generals for

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.400 
defense I've barely used my generals for
attack<00:04:07.910> because<00:04:08.239> I<00:04:08.270> prefer<00:04:08.840> to<00:04:09.050> have<00:04:09.200> them

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
attack because I prefer to have them

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:11.920 
attack because I prefer to have them
alive<00:04:09.800> and<00:04:10.010> ready<00:04:10.730> to<00:04:10.820> defend<00:04:11.209> just<00:04:11.450> in<00:04:11.600> case<00:04:11.780> I

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
generals do help a lot in defense

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.150 
generals do help a lot in defense
because<00:04:15.110> of<00:04:15.260> how<00:04:15.560> much<00:04:15.739> health<00:04:15.980> they<00:04:16.130> have

think<00:04:28.259> it's<00:04:28.380> ridiculous<00:04:28.880> honestly<00:04:29.880> I<00:04:29.910> don't

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
think it's ridiculous honestly I don't

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.340 
think it's ridiculous honestly I don't
think<00:04:30.210> the<00:04:30.360> general<00:04:30.509> should<00:04:30.930> die<00:04:31.110> in<00:04:31.139> an

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
think the general should die in an

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.800 
think the general should die in an
attack<00:04:31.590> but<00:04:31.830> it<00:04:31.979> does<00:04:32.160> make<00:04:32.310> sense<00:04:32.639> that<00:04:32.940> even

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
attack but it does make sense that even

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.510 
attack but it does make sense that even
if<00:04:33.930> they<00:04:34.110> get<00:04:34.380> injured<00:04:34.680> even<00:04:35.009> if<00:04:35.190> they<00:04:35.310> don't

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
if they get injured even if they don't

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.430 
if they get injured even if they don't
attack<00:04:35.910> I<00:04:36.090> mean<00:04:36.270> even<00:04:36.419> if<00:04:36.509> they<00:04:36.630> don't<00:04:36.900> die<00:04:37.169> and

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
attack I mean even if they don't die and

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.350 
attack I mean even if they don't die and
you<00:04:38.070> have<00:04:38.190> to<00:04:38.310> wait<00:04:38.520> for<00:04:38.699> the<00:04:38.759> generals<00:04:39.150> to

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
you have to wait for the generals to

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.150 
you have to wait for the generals to
come<00:04:39.539> back<00:04:39.750> and<00:04:39.990> if<00:04:40.320> you<00:04:40.440> want<00:04:40.620> to<00:04:40.680> use<00:04:40.800> them<00:04:41.039> to

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
come back and if you want to use them to

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.070 
come back and if you want to use them to
attack<00:04:41.400> now<00:04:41.550> understand<00:04:42.090> why<00:04:42.300> the<00:04:42.360> developers

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
attack now understand why the developers

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.480 
attack now understand why the developers
did<00:04:43.259> this<00:04:43.440> is<00:04:43.560> because<00:04:43.590> they<00:04:44.009> probably<00:04:44.190> don't

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
did this is because they probably don't

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.820 
did this is because they probably don't
want<00:04:44.639> you<00:04:45.000> to<00:04:45.210> abuse<00:04:45.570> the<00:04:45.810> generals<00:04:46.229> every

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
want you to abuse the generals every

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.070 
want you to abuse the generals every
single<00:04:47.160> time<00:04:47.430> every<00:04:48.270> single<00:04:48.419> attack<00:04:48.780> because

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
single time every single attack because

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.200 
single time every single attack because
the<00:04:49.169> generals<00:04:49.560> kind<00:04:49.860> of<00:04:50.009> are<00:04:50.370> unfair<00:04:50.910> because

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
the generals kind of are unfair because

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:53.570 
the generals kind of are unfair because
they<00:04:51.300> have<00:04:51.389> like<00:04:51.509> 10,000<00:04:52.139> health<00:04:52.289> and<00:04:53.190> they

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
they have like 10,000 health and they

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:54.980 
they have like 10,000 health and they
are<00:04:53.669> kind<00:04:53.970> of<00:04:54.090> there<00:04:54.360> they're<00:04:54.660> pretty<00:04:54.810> damn

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
are kind of there they're pretty damn

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.360 
are kind of there they're pretty damn
strong<00:04:55.229> I'll<00:04:55.470> tell<00:04:55.650> you<00:04:55.710> that<00:04:55.740> right<00:04:55.949> out<00:04:56.009> the

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
strong I'll tell you that right out the

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.760 
strong I'll tell you that right out the
generals<00:04:56.699> are<00:04:56.789> very<00:04:56.970> strong<00:04:57.300> so<00:04:57.539> I<00:04:58.440> think<00:04:58.500> this

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
generals are very strong so I think this

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.650 
generals are very strong so I think this
it<00:04:58.979> is<00:04:59.160> kind<00:04:59.400> of<00:04:59.430> abusive<00:04:59.940> if<00:05:00.150> you<00:05:00.330> were<00:05:00.449> able

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
it is kind of abusive if you were able

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.900 
it is kind of abusive if you were able
to<00:05:00.930> use<00:05:01.199> it<00:05:01.410> constantly<00:05:01.830> in<00:05:02.280> battle<00:05:02.610> so<00:05:02.759> that's

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
to use it constantly in battle so that's

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:04.430 
to use it constantly in battle so that's
why<00:05:03.000> they<00:05:03.120> probably<00:05:03.330> make<00:05:03.660> you<00:05:03.810> wait<00:05:04.020> even<00:05:04.169> if

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
why they probably make you wait even if

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.050 
why they probably make you wait even if
it<00:05:04.560> doesn't<00:05:04.800> die<00:05:05.190> even<00:05:05.550> if<00:05:05.639> your<00:05:05.789> general

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
it doesn't die even if your general

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.089 
it doesn't die even if your general
doesn't<00:05:06.240> die<00:05:06.509> so<00:05:07.080> that's<00:05:07.229> my<00:05:07.500> opinion<00:05:07.740> on<00:05:08.070> it

00:05:08.089 --> 00:05:08.099 
doesn't die so that's my opinion on it

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:09.710 
doesn't die so that's my opinion on it
but<00:05:08.820> yeah<00:05:09.270> there<00:05:09.449> you<00:05:09.539> go

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
but yeah there you go

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.350 
but yeah there you go
and<00:05:09.930> also<00:05:10.710> another<00:05:10.830> thing<00:05:10.979> should<00:05:11.910> you<00:05:12.060> rush

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
and also another thing should you rush

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.600 
and also another thing should you rush
the<00:05:12.570> castle<00:05:13.110> building<00:05:13.470> in<00:05:13.590> a<00:05:13.680> medieval<00:05:13.860> age<00:05:14.220> or

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
the castle building in a medieval age or

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.189 
the castle building in a medieval age or
the<00:05:15.000> Gunpowder<00:05:15.419> or<00:05:15.539> whatever<00:05:15.780> age<00:05:15.930> you're<00:05:16.169> at

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:16.199 
the Gunpowder or whatever age you're at

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:17.510 
the Gunpowder or whatever age you're at
you<00:05:16.470> will<00:05:16.590> get<00:05:16.710> this<00:05:16.860> at<00:05:16.979> the<00:05:17.070> medieval<00:05:17.400> age

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
you will get this at the medieval age

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.339 
you will get this at the medieval age
but<00:05:17.669> should<00:05:17.849> you<00:05:17.880> ever<00:05:18.180> rush<00:05:18.570> the<00:05:18.750> castle<00:05:19.199> in

00:05:19.339 --> 00:05:19.349 
but should you ever rush the castle in

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:22.879 
but should you ever rush the castle in
my<00:05:19.889> opinion<00:05:20.400> it's<00:05:20.910> kind<00:05:21.389> of<00:05:21.449> a<00:05:21.599> no<00:05:21.870> because<00:05:22.680> it

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:22.889 
my opinion it's kind of a no because it

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:25.310 
my opinion it's kind of a no because it
does<00:05:23.099> take<00:05:23.370> like<00:05:23.610> 3<00:05:24.030> to<00:05:24.150> 4<00:05:24.419> days<00:05:24.630> or<00:05:24.870> maybe<00:05:25.020> 2

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
does take like 3 to 4 days or maybe 2

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.589 
does take like 3 to 4 days or maybe 2
days<00:05:25.470> to<00:05:25.680> build<00:05:25.800> it<00:05:26.010> I<00:05:26.760> don't<00:05:27.180> think<00:05:27.360> it's<00:05:27.479> a

00:05:27.589 --> 00:05:27.599 
days to build it I don't think it's a

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:29.689 
days to build it I don't think it's a
building<00:05:27.990> ship<00:05:28.169> prioritised<00:05:28.919> but<00:05:29.310> if<00:05:29.520> you

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:29.699 
building ship prioritised but if you

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:31.460 
building ship prioritised but if you
have<00:05:29.909> the<00:05:30.090> time<00:05:30.330> make<00:05:30.570> sure<00:05:30.780> you<00:05:30.930> do<00:05:31.080> get<00:05:31.289> it

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:31.470 
have the time make sure you do get it

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:33.350 
have the time make sure you do get it
because<00:05:31.590> it<00:05:31.860> is<00:05:31.889> a<00:05:32.010> great<00:05:32.400> defensive<00:05:33.000> buffer

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
because it is a great defensive buffer

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.089 
because it is a great defensive buffer
so<00:05:33.960> yeah<00:05:34.289> there<00:05:34.530> we<00:05:34.650> go<00:05:34.770> guys<00:05:34.919> that's
