to<00:02:23.140> think<00:02:23.290> most<00:02:23.530> of<00:02:23.620> the<00:02:23.709> wrestling<00:02:24.069> fans<00:02:24.310> just

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
to think most of the wrestling fans just

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.430 
to think most of the wrestling fans just
washed<00:02:24.880> it<00:02:25.060> there<00:02:25.300> and<00:02:25.450> if<00:02:25.569> they<00:02:26.050> don't<00:02:26.200> have

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
washed it there and if they don't have

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.720 
washed it there and if they don't have
the<00:02:26.560> network<00:02:26.860> they<00:02:27.040> got<00:02:27.190> the<00:02:27.310> free<00:02:27.550> gift

Rumble<00:05:38.080> fix<00:05:38.650> was<00:05:38.889> probably<00:05:39.219> good<00:05:39.460> because<00:05:39.699> of

00:05:39.959 --> 00:05:39.969 
Rumble fix was probably good because of

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:41.429 
Rumble fix was probably good because of
that<00:05:40.089> one<00:05:40.419> time<00:05:40.629> deal<00:05:40.900> was<00:05:41.080> the<00:05:41.199> night<00:05:41.409> after

00:05:41.429 --> 00:05:41.439 
that one time deal was the night after

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:43.110 
that one time deal was the night after
the<00:05:41.919> rumble<00:05:42.219> so<00:05:42.339> they<00:05:42.430> just<00:05:42.580> put<00:05:42.699> the<00:05:42.819> rumble

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120 
the rumble so they just put the rumble

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.929 
the rumble so they just put the rumble
on<00:05:43.270> there<00:05:43.740> but<00:05:44.740> I'm<00:05:45.099> hoping<00:05:45.490> that<00:05:45.789> they're

00:05:45.929 --> 00:05:45.939 
on there but I'm hoping that they're

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:47.909 
on there but I'm hoping that they're
able<00:05:46.060> to<00:05:46.270> find<00:05:46.479> a<00:05:46.599> new<00:05:46.779> venue<00:05:46.810> in<00:05:47.379> a<00:05:47.469> new<00:05:47.589> area
