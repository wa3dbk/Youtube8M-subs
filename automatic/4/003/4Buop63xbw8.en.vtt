 episode of pokemon channel and good today 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:10.360
 I bring you all x the pokemon type 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.350
 good laburator let's start with this 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:16.860
 pokemon to see 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:22.720
 hebe es hebe 252 stories in defense is 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:24.490
 200 in special defense and 56 in ps and 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.010
 you see that that is what you see are very 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:30.250
 spread out let's make a troll x very 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:32.680
 equaled to see nature nature 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.370
 daring the defense goes up and the 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.430
 attack 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:39.550
 we do not need attack for anything objects 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:42.309
 obligatory remains remains there are people who 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.530
 puts king rock for what to do to 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:47.710
 roll back more but we the 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:51.610
 foolishness is better remains much better 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:53.920
 remains bliss skill that increases the 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.289
 possibility to roll back very well 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.480
 because we want to push back 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:00.360
 you will ask then nothing now we pass to 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.960
 the movements and we'll see why 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.350
 movement 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.840
 air cut learns it in fresh town 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.960
 giving a heart flake to you 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.520
 recalls remembered movements of 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.789
 movements 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.310
 Thunder wave it on for mt breathe the 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:21.670
 turn on by mt and magical shine lights it 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:25.030
 for mt this movement is very simple 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:28.030
 it's very typical for x lists and then 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.259
 You make aerial cuts more air cut than 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.969
 It also has possibilities to do 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:34.209
 back down more skill said 

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:36.569
 we have the incredible possibility to do 

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:40.329
 go back I think it's 60 percent 

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:43.420
 60 70 50 I do not know how much it is but out there 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:45.130
 it's more thunder wave that also has 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.310
 possibilities 10 percent of 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.390
 paralyzed or is either paralyzed or 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.610
 well we make it go back 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.009
 it is very important to have remains because 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.509
 while we are doing this this 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:57.310
 technique to paralyze good 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.979
 make them go back and paralyze 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:04.130
 with remains we will end with all life 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:06.259
 cured and if we do not use respite and that's it 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.349
 you can see that it's a bit too fucking and 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:11.150
 also with this with this nature you go 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:12.920
 to see that the final statistics of 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.019
 everything if they are incredible is very good 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.100
 distributed and well let's move on to 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:19.840
 see them like that you get rid of doubts 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.870
 and here we have the final statistics 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:26.340
 of touch quiz to level 100 goes first 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:30.870
 of all ps 325 that is not bad 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:34.740
 attack 122 we do not care defense 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:37.000
 317 that is very well special attack 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.280
 276 which is also great for not 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.330
 have risen nothing of any attack 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.680
 Special has enough special defense 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.690
 316 that you see that is equal to the 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.140
 defense by a point only or is it 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:52.600
 a very equal pokemon of speed 196 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.960
 it's good it's slow but it overcomes the 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.340
 tanks in plan ramus etcetera and good 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.440
 here we have the final statistics of 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.780
 all x to level 100 and I hope that I have 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.550
