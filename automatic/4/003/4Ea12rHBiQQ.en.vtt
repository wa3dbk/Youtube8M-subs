 to go to the market 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:29.109
 The mushrooms come from the environment, the 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:33.230
 let's know 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:34.970

 very dry in this country 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.420

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:58.160
 in the open kitchen of the restaurant pot 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.500

 salting and peppering 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.719
 because the preparation of the mushrooms is only one 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.719

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.709
 so that can not burn already 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.400
