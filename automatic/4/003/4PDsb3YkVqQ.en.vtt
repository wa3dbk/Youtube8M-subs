00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.680
 hello my name is Anton and I 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:09.599
 I work in the field of journalism which member 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.170
 your favorite psychological 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.630
 theory 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.519
 explaining the relationship between men and 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.570
 by women 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:21.150
 thanks to him everyone including 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.890
 closest to the market economy 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.010
 This question is necessary to solve 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.410
 of love 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:32.120
 institutes work closest 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.070
 Americans and I really like them 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:37.020
 decent enough american style 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.700
 cynical theory called price 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.219
 in the brides and grooms market 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.860
 the essence of this theory is that 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.440
 each of us has his conditional price 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.510
 in the brides and grooms market 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:53.610
 how on the slopes of business exist 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.399
 first-class geldings or old nags 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.820
 so in the general human society on 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.190
 this market itself is different 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.729
 factors that make 1 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.590
 more expensive than the other in the market grooms and 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.909
 brides 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.130
 parameters by which usually 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:15.240
 calculate the cynical americans it 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:17.670
 each of us is different signs 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.610
 Well, for example, physical data is who 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.350
 more beautiful then definitely more expensive in the market 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.200
 brides and grooms one who is not very 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.820
 beautifully who is this price to me 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.240
 in the brides and grooms market 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:33.060
 what is kinder is the one who is socially significant 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.570
 a star is always more valuable than that star 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.460
 Who 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.460
 intellectual development spiritual 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.899
 development is the one who has 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.520
 brilliant financial position when 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.159
 self-discipline these people are considered more 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.890
 expensive at the brides and grooms market and 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.630
 bringing along this value 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.450
 unconditionally have a shield right 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.979
 what is the valuable partner of scientists 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.280
 estimated that only 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:59.530
 different in marriage and live happily ever after 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.909
 so every person who wants 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.270
 be happy love 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:06.909
 should be modest enough 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.459
 in assessing your own 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:11.980
 of significance we should also 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:14.910
 underestimate yourself how many do it 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.200
 Russian women to 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.989
 correctly evaluate yourself 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.730
 you need to know yourself very well and 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:24.790
 partner or potential partner and 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.130
 in order to increase its value 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.310
 on rbg grooms and brides of course you can 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:32.440
 it would grow as little as possible 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.459
 grow in the eyes of a potential chosen one 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:40.000
 if you are about indiscreet varieties they took 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:44.650
 a lot of large representative

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.360
