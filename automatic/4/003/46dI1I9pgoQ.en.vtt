00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:13.169
 are dismembered teachers of the baccalaureate course in question and the 

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:16.509
 Senac University Center International Chef 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:18.119
 santa marta fields 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.119
 today we will do a little bit about sustainable food 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.619
 for both we must have for the freddie parmegiana chicken with another seven a 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:25.970
 little 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.609
 different from the character 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:29.319
 we will start with the preparer 

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:32.590
 benedito marques with homemade tomato sauce 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.610
 because industrialized sauces are marketed in arkansas are 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:37.249
 easy 

00:00:37.249 --> 00:00:39.390
 we are investing in our environment 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.320
 already a homemade sauce is produced with foods there is a cure we will give preference 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.970
 by organic foods that are produced without the use of 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.670
 fertilizers are chemicals so they do not 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:52.600
 environment 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.450
 organic foods may seem less attractive - and with uniform colleagues 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.450
 do not think much more intuitive and tasty 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.120
 put in the pan with about two feet of water to boil 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.780
 then until they are in the dispute are four times more quality 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.230
 I bet they are at the scene of the accident for about two months 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.920
 the attack and even start to release 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.360
 used more times as theme said lacognata 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.690
 on this day to stop the passing 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.780
 then for taking a semi-final vacation 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.450
 You can follow on Mondays 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.340
 for better use of tomatoes 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.770
 beat in the blender the following and until withdrawal 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.790
 yes there is a fine sieve 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.740
 r7 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.260
 brown the onion in olive oil 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:58.810
 Add the garlic 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.130
 all this yet 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.180
 add diced tomatoes 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.040
 I talked to him 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.040
 the museum visited 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.079
 the hospital 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:15.569
 as a result 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.809
 softly until you get the desired consistency 

00:02:19.899 --> 00:02:22.899
 after passing your errand 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:27.730
 after the preparation of the tomato sauce 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.059
 we do not want now prepared added 

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:33.289
 for this recipe being underused organic chicken 

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:37.079
 created with a natural diet without the use of medicinal products or 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:38.269
 hormones 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.139
 therefore much healthier 

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:44.639
 we will use a past cooking method instead of writer this because 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:46.530
 this residual oil burned 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.370
 generates many damages - environment and especially if not treated 

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:56.049
 season the steaks with 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:59.049
 lincoln 

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:04.149
 mix well 

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:07.149
 Spread the middle morning two sides of fillet 

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:14.169
 in full flaked corn flour 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.659
 26 incarnated in baking sheet lined with buttered paper 

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:22.760
 and bring to the preheated oven 180graus 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.349
 lasted approximately 20 minutes 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:30.779
 in half the time and told them to be evenly golden 

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:35.419
 put the tomato sauce on each of the three 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:40.129
 top with a slice of mozzarella cheese 

00:03:41.999 --> 00:03:44.999
 Bake again for whomever you want to check 

00:03:47.779 --> 00:03:48.629
 very well 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:51.639
 we arrived at the end of the preparation of the northern chicken fillet Ã  parmegiana 

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:55.549
 much more nutritious and sustainable 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:58.279
 we use organic products 

00:03:58.279 --> 00:04:00.939
 and we do not use paint in the preparation process 

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:03.939
 and reduced volumes of waste in the environment 

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:08.219
 if we have the consumption of this delicious parmegiana chicken fillet with rice 

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:08.959
 integral 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:11.959
 the appetite 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.550
 burns 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.849
