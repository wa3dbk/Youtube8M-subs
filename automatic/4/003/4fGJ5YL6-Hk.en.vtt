00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
line the marbles make but when we add

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.300 
line the marbles make but when we add
the<00:02:22.950> second<00:02:23.519> slit<00:02:24.739> something<00:02:25.739> different

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
the second slit something different

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.050 
the second slit something different
happens<00:02:26.760> if<00:02:27.720> the<00:02:27.989> top<00:02:28.260> of<00:02:28.290> one<00:02:28.799> wave<00:02:29.130> meets<00:02:29.790> the

happens if the top of one wave meets the
bottom<00:02:30.569> of<00:02:30.750> another<00:02:31.260> wave<00:02:31.940> they<00:02:32.940> cancel<00:02:33.480> each

bottom of another wave they cancel each
other<00:02:33.780> out<00:02:34.730> so<00:02:35.730> now<00:02:36.030> there<00:02:36.870> is<00:02:36.900> an

places where the two tops meet are the

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
highest intensity the bright lines and

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.039 
highest intensity the bright lines and
where<00:02:46.380> they<00:02:46.530> cancel<00:02:47.190> there<00:02:47.760> is<00:02:47.910> nothing<00:02:48.329> so

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
where they cancel there is nothing so

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:52.819 
where they cancel there is nothing so

through<00:02:53.760> two<00:02:54.150> slits<00:02:54.690> we<00:02:55.350> get<00:02:55.560> this<00:02:55.940> two<00:02:56.940> bands

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
through two slits we get this two bands

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.099 
through two slits we get this two bands
of<00:02:57.720> hits<00:02:58.019> and<00:02:58.609> with<00:02:59.609> waves<00:02:59.970> we<00:03:00.750> get<00:03:00.989> an

of hits and with waves we get an

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:05.449
