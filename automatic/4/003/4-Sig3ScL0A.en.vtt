00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.509 
to stencil images of doors and windows
on<00:00:22.320> one<00:00:22.590> of<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:23.689> jelly<00:00:24.689> prints<00:00:25.109> so<00:00:25.920> i<00:00:25.949> squeezed

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
on one of the jelly prints so i squeezed

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.210 
on one of the jelly prints so i squeezed
out<00:00:26.670> some<00:00:27.000> black<00:00:27.210> fluid<00:00:27.599> acrylic<00:00:28.140> paint<00:00:28.410> on<00:00:28.769> my

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
out some black fluid acrylic paint on my

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.990 
out some black fluid acrylic paint on my
palette<00:00:30.090> and<00:00:30.529> using<00:00:31.529> a<00:00:31.619> cosmetic<00:00:32.219> sponge<00:00:32.610> i'm

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
palette and using a cosmetic sponge i'm

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.260 
palette and using a cosmetic sponge i'm
just<00:00:33.329> bouncing<00:00:33.989> up<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.440> down<00:00:34.559> on<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:35.270> stencil

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
just bouncing up and down on the stencil

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.560 
just bouncing up and down on the stencil
now<00:00:36.540> this<00:00:36.719> stencil<00:00:37.110> has<00:00:37.530> very<00:00:38.070> very<00:00:38.460> thin<00:00:38.940> fine

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
now this stencil has very very thin fine

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.190 
now this stencil has very very thin fine
openings<00:00:40.379> so<00:00:41.309> it's<00:00:41.820> very<00:00:42.210> important<00:00:42.870> not<00:00:42.960> to

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
openings so it's very important not to

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.819 
openings so it's very important not to
load<00:00:43.920> up<00:00:44.100> your<00:00:44.660> cosmetic<00:00:45.660> sponge<00:00:45.989> or<00:00:46.410> whatever

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
load up your cosmetic sponge or whatever

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.240 
load up your cosmetic sponge or whatever
you're<00:00:47.100> using<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.640> apply<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.300> paint<00:00:49.020> with

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
you're using to apply the paint with

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.549 
you're using to apply the paint with
with<00:00:50.250> too<00:00:50.460> much<00:00:50.610> paint<00:00:50.910> so<00:00:51.449> you<00:00:51.539> really<00:00:52.289> want

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
with too much paint so you really want

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.090 
with too much paint so you really want
to<00:00:52.920> dab<00:00:53.370> off<00:00:53.719> probably<00:00:54.719> more<00:00:54.960> paint<00:00:55.350> than<00:00:55.620> you

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
to dab off probably more paint than you

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.750 
to dab off probably more paint than you
leave<00:00:56.370> on

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.750 

I<00:01:00.850> cut<00:01:01.600> out<00:01:01.629> the<00:01:01.899> door<00:01:02.109> that<00:01:02.710> I<00:01:02.739> was<00:01:03.460> going<00:01:03.609> to

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
I cut out the door that I was going to

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.910 
I cut out the door that I was going to
use<00:01:03.910> and<00:01:04.390> then<00:01:04.540> I<00:01:04.570> looked<00:01:04.989> back<00:01:05.229> at<00:01:05.439> my<00:01:05.590> tags

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
use and then I looked back at my tags

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.060 
use and then I looked back at my tags
again<00:01:06.340> and<00:01:06.580> actually<00:01:07.150> selected<00:01:07.799> some<00:01:08.799> tags

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
again and actually selected some tags

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.389 
again and actually selected some tags
that<00:01:09.399> I<00:01:09.460> had<00:01:09.700> made<00:01:09.939> in<00:01:10.270> a<00:01:10.990> get<00:01:11.320> tagged<00:01:11.680> art

00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:12.399 
that I had made in a get tagged art

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:15.300 
that I had made in a get tagged art
party<00:01:13.000> at<00:01:13.180> my<00:01:13.390> home<00:01:13.570> studio<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:15.040> I'm<00:01:15.159> just

auditioning the door on the tags and

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.649 
auditioning the door on the tags and
then<00:01:17.860> I<00:01:18.009> decided<00:01:18.430> that<00:01:18.610> I<00:01:18.820> wanted<00:01:19.240> to<00:01:19.390> lighten

and you can see I'm being very loose i'm
actually<00:01:32.020> going<00:01:32.439> back<00:01:32.710> and<00:01:32.979> doing<00:01:33.039> that<00:01:33.460> on

actually going back and doing that on

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
all the doors and windows that I

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.540 
all the doors and windows that I
stenciled<00:01:36.340> i<00:01:36.960> like<00:01:37.960> to<00:01:38.229> be<00:01:38.409> very<00:01:38.440> loose<00:01:39.069> when<00:01:39.520> i

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:39.550 
stenciled i like to be very loose when i

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.350 
stenciled i like to be very loose when i
add<00:01:39.940> these<00:01:40.560> outlines<00:01:41.560> to<00:01:42.429> whatever<00:01:43.149> I've

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
add these outlines to whatever I've

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.330 
add these outlines to whatever I've
stenciled<00:01:43.929> because<00:01:44.259> I<00:01:44.350> feel<00:01:44.590> that<00:01:44.619> that<00:01:45.100> is

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
stenciled because I feel that that is

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.510 
stenciled because I feel that that is
part<00:01:45.670> of<00:01:45.759> what<00:01:46.030> gives<00:01:46.360> it<00:01:46.539> an<00:01:47.220> individual<00:01:48.220> look

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
part of what gives it an individual look

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.990 
part of what gives it an individual look
that's<00:01:48.819> unique<00:01:49.299> to<00:01:49.330> my<00:01:49.780> hand<00:01:50.259> and<00:01:50.560> the<00:01:50.679> way<00:01:50.799> I

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
that's unique to my hand and the way I

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.669 
that's unique to my hand and the way I
paint<00:01:52.000> as<00:01:52.270> opposed<00:01:52.630> to<00:01:52.810> just<00:01:52.840> having<00:01:53.080> it<00:01:53.470> be

00:01:53.669 --> 00:01:53.679 
paint as opposed to just having it be

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:57.870 
paint as opposed to just having it be
straight<00:01:54.869> out<00:01:55.869> of<00:01:55.899> the<00:01:56.500> stencil<00:01:57.280> so<00:01:57.490> to<00:01:57.549> speak

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
straight out of the stencil so to speak

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.910 
straight out of the stencil so to speak
so<00:01:58.149> now<00:01:59.110> I'm<00:01:59.289> arranging<00:01:59.619> it<00:02:00.690> and<00:02:01.690> at<00:02:02.259> first<00:02:02.530> i

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
so now I'm arranging it and at first i

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.609 
so now I'm arranging it and at first i
glue<00:02:03.700> the<00:02:03.729> door<00:02:04.119> down<00:02:04.330> smack<00:02:05.170> in<00:02:05.379> the<00:02:05.440> middle

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
glue the door down smack in the middle

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:08.400 
glue the door down smack in the middle
of<00:02:05.860> my<00:02:05.920> tag<00:02:06.310> but<00:02:06.640> then<00:02:06.819> I<00:02:06.849> remember<00:02:07.450> something

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
of my tag but then I remember something

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.690 
of my tag but then I remember something
cindy<00:02:09.220> one<00:02:09.429> she<00:02:09.550> once<00:02:09.729> said<00:02:09.910> to<00:02:09.970> me<00:02:10.119> about

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
cindy one she once said to me about

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.910 
cindy one she once said to me about
putting<00:02:12.700> your<00:02:13.060> images<00:02:13.840> off<00:02:14.020> center<00:02:14.620> that<00:02:14.830> it

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
putting your images off center that it

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.410 
putting your images off center that it
makes<00:02:15.099> it<00:02:15.280> a<00:02:15.340> lot<00:02:15.430> more<00:02:15.489> interesting<00:02:16.300> and

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
makes it a lot more interesting and

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.559 
makes it a lot more interesting and
she's<00:02:17.170> absolutely<00:02:17.530> right<00:02:18.129> about<00:02:18.190> that<00:02:18.569> so

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:19.569 
she's absolutely right about that so

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:22.890 
she's absolutely right about that so
what<00:02:19.780> I<00:02:20.019> added<00:02:20.560> some<00:02:20.980> blue<00:02:21.580> delhi<00:02:22.090> paper<00:02:22.420> that

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
what I added some blue delhi paper that

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
in her art journal all the strips were

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.059 
in her art journal all the strips were
parallel<00:03:49.819> to<00:03:50.209> one<00:03:50.360> another<00:03:50.390> but<00:03:50.930> as<00:03:51.560> so<00:03:51.799> often

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:52.069 
parallel to one another but as so often

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:55.449 
parallel to one another but as so often
happens<00:03:52.250> when<00:03:53.030> you're<00:03:53.450> inspired<00:03:54.110> by<00:03:54.459> someone

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
happens when you're inspired by someone

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.600 
happens when you're inspired by someone
else's<00:03:55.760> work<00:03:56.090> and<00:03:56.450> and<00:03:56.769> then<00:03:57.769> start<00:03:58.190> working

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
else's work and and then start working

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.440 
else's work and and then start working
on<00:03:58.790> your<00:03:58.819> own<00:03:59.269> your<00:03:59.989> own<00:04:00.430> imagination<00:04:01.450> your

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
on your own your own imagination your

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.309 
on your own your own imagination your
muse<00:04:02.870> takes<00:04:03.319> you<00:04:03.650> in<00:04:03.980> another<00:04:04.549> direction<00:04:05.319> so

00:04:06.309 --> 00:04:06.319 
muse takes you in another direction so

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:09.819 
muse takes you in another direction so
your<00:04:07.250> piece<00:04:07.519> is<00:04:07.760> inspired<00:04:08.269> by<00:04:08.420> but<00:04:09.079> it<00:04:09.349> is

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:09.829 
your piece is inspired by but it is

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:13.990 
your piece is inspired by but it is
different<00:04:10.430> and<00:04:10.849> unique<00:04:11.360> to<00:04:11.690> you<00:04:11.810> so<00:04:12.739> I<00:04:13.040> decided

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
different and unique to you so I decided

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.330 
different and unique to you so I decided
to<00:04:14.450> actually<00:04:14.810> start<00:04:15.379> overlapping<00:04:15.950> these

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
to actually start overlapping these

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.390 
to actually start overlapping these
pieces<00:04:16.669> to<00:04:17.419> make<00:04:17.660> some<00:04:17.959> of<00:04:18.109> them

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
pieces to make some of them

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.580 
pieces to make some of them
perpendicular<00:04:19.400> to<00:04:19.970> one<00:04:20.090> another<00:04:20.419> until<00:04:20.720> it

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
perpendicular to one another until it

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.969 
perpendicular to one another until it
started<00:04:22.130> looking<00:04:22.880> a<00:04:23.229> little<00:04:24.229> bit<00:04:24.470> like<00:04:24.650> a

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:24.979 
started looking a little bit like a

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:26.890 
started looking a little bit like a
weave<00:04:25.220> like<00:04:25.580> a<00:04:25.610> basket<00:04:26.120> weave<00:04:26.270> but<00:04:26.539> of<00:04:26.660> course

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
weave like a basket weave but of course

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.940 
weave like a basket weave but of course
it's<00:04:27.139> not<00:04:27.200> truly<00:04:28.130> that<00:04:28.610> because<00:04:29.180> the<00:04:30.139> strips

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
it's not truly that because the strips

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.719 
it's not truly that because the strips
are<00:04:31.160> not<00:04:31.669> going<00:04:31.910> in<00:04:32.210> and<00:04:32.479> out<00:04:32.630> of<00:04:32.930> one<00:04:33.410> another

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:33.729 
are not going in and out of one another

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:37.150 
are not going in and out of one another
but<00:04:34.729> here<00:04:34.970> it<00:04:35.060> is<00:04:35.090> all<00:04:35.599> done<00:04:35.660> and<00:04:35.990> I<00:04:36.620> started

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160 
but here it is all done and I started

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.730 
but here it is all done and I started
adding<00:04:37.490> little<00:04:38.180> squares<00:04:38.690> here<00:04:39.110> and<00:04:39.289> there<00:04:39.440> and

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
adding little squares here and there and

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.529 
adding little squares here and there and
so<00:04:39.979> it<00:04:40.220> has<00:04:40.430> the<00:04:40.700> illusion<00:04:40.970> of<00:04:41.389> a<00:04:42.320> weave<00:04:43.539> I'm

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:44.539 
so it has the illusion of a weave I'm

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:46.390 
so it has the illusion of a weave I'm
not<00:04:44.750> really<00:04:44.960> sure<00:04:45.139> what<00:04:45.770> I'm<00:04:45.979> going<00:04:46.160> to<00:04:46.220> do

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
not really sure what I'm going to do

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.460 
not really sure what I'm going to do
with<00:04:46.550> this<00:04:46.700> but<00:04:47.240> for<00:04:47.539> now<00:04:47.660> I'm<00:04:47.960> just<00:04:48.020> really
