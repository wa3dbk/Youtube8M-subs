button and a little note of them
automatically<00:02:45.750> the<00:02:45.959> latches<00:02:46.350> I<00:02:47.750> lock

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
automatically the latches I lock

00:02:48.750 --> 00:03:01.930 
automatically the latches I lock
themselves<00:02:50.120> from<00:02:51.120> their<00:02:51.299> unlock<00:02:51.690> position

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:09.320 

see<00:03:03.020> so<00:03:04.020> this<00:03:04.650> is<00:03:04.860> too<00:03:05.400> much<00:03:05.550> okay<00:03:08.090> what<00:03:09.090> comes

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
see so this is too much okay what comes

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:18.910 
see so this is too much okay what comes
handy<00:03:11.030> look<00:03:15.080> much<00:03:16.080> more<00:03:16.290> clearer

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:31.610 

actuator<00:03:27.530> do<00:03:28.530> not<00:03:28.709> ask<00:03:29.040> anything<00:03:29.790> about<00:03:30.620> these

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
actuator do not ask anything about these

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.250 
actuator do not ask anything about these
wires<00:03:32.070> over<00:03:32.940> the<00:03:33.060> fields<00:03:33.360> if<00:03:33.480> then<00:03:33.870> I've<00:03:33.989> been

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
wires over the fields if then I've been

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.850 
wires over the fields if then I've been
into<00:03:34.560> the<00:03:34.650> system

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
into the system

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.470 
into the system
thank<00:03:37.860> you<00:03:37.920> very<00:03:38.040> much<00:03:38.190> for<00:03:39.060> watching<00:03:39.180> over
