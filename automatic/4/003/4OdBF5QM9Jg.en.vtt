collection<00:00:36.680> first<00:00:37.370> let's<00:00:38.030> go<00:00:38.330> over<00:00:38.809> the<00:00:39.019> stats

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
collection first let's go over the stats

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.939 
collection first let's go over the stats
it's<00:00:40.160> got<00:00:40.430> a<00:00:40.699> spherical<00:00:41.540> and<00:00:41.750> IDI<00:00:42.559> glass

it's got a spherical and IDI glass
elements<00:00:43.579> which<00:00:44.030> helps<00:00:44.809> cut<00:00:45.050> down<00:00:45.260> on<00:00:45.680> the

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:45.979 
elements which helps cut down on the

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:49.000 
elements which helps cut down on the
chromatic<00:00:46.430> aberration<00:00:47.089> as<00:00:47.449> well<00:00:48.350> as<00:00:48.530> ghosting

chromatic aberration as well as ghosting

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.880 
chromatic aberration as well as ghosting
and<00:00:49.280> it<00:00:50.000> also<00:00:50.210> improves<00:00:50.650> corner<00:00:51.650> to<00:00:51.739> corner

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
and it also improves corner to corner

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.329 
and it also improves corner to corner
sharpness<00:00:52.360> it<00:00:53.360> has<00:00:53.510> rear<00:00:54.199> focus<00:00:54.650> which<00:00:55.309> is

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:55.339 
sharpness it has rear focus which is

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:59.560 
sharpness it has rear focus which is
very<00:00:56.299> nice<00:00:56.979> so<00:00:57.979> the<00:00:58.129> lens<00:00:58.309> doesn't<00:00:58.699> extend<00:00:59.269> in

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
very nice so the lens doesn't extend in

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.630 
very nice so the lens doesn't extend in
and<00:00:59.900> out<00:01:00.019> as<00:01:00.260> its<00:01:00.500> focusing<00:01:01.100> I'm<00:01:01.369> sure<00:01:01.519> you

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
and out as its focusing I'm sure you

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:02.920 
and out as its focusing I'm sure you
guys<00:01:01.820> have<00:01:01.850> seen<00:01:02.119> that<00:01:02.239> before<00:01:02.360> where<00:01:02.750> it<00:01:02.809> just

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
guys have seen that before where it just

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.270 
guys have seen that before where it just
kind<00:01:02.989> of<00:01:03.140> goes<00:01:03.260> in<00:01:03.409> and<00:01:03.619> out<00:01:03.680> like<00:01:03.769> that<00:01:04.010> that's

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
kind of goes in and out like that that's

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.060 
kind of goes in and out like that that's
really<00:01:04.790> annoying<00:01:05.030> it's<00:01:05.990> got<00:01:06.110> a<00:01:06.140> built-in<00:01:06.860> lens

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
really annoying it's got a built-in lens

two pounds this lens is also capable of

two pounds this lens is also capable of
capturing<00:01:23.300> an<00:01:23.660> incredible<00:01:24.530> field<00:01:24.800> view<00:01:25.100> and

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
capturing an incredible field view and

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.540 
capturing an incredible field view and
the<00:01:25.490> contrast<00:01:26.090> on<00:01:26.270> it<00:01:26.420> it's<00:01:26.540> fantastic<00:01:27.250> now<00:01:28.250> it

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:28.550 
the contrast on it it's fantastic now it

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:30.880 
the contrast on it it's fantastic now it
does<00:01:28.880> distort<00:01:29.330> towards<00:01:29.870> the<00:01:29.990> edges<00:01:30.320> that's

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
does distort towards the edges that's

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.090 
does distort towards the edges that's
just<00:01:31.250> the<00:01:31.400> nature<00:01:31.580> of<00:01:31.760> wide-angle<00:01:32.480> lens

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
just the nature of wide-angle lens

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.520 
just the nature of wide-angle lens
especially<00:01:34.100> on<00:01:34.190> super<00:01:34.610> wide<00:01:34.790> angle<00:01:35.090> lenses

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
especially on super wide angle lenses

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.160 
especially on super wide angle lenses
but<00:01:36.530> the<00:01:37.100> nice<00:01:37.430> thing<00:01:37.670> is<00:01:37.700> you<00:01:37.850> can<00:01:38.240> leverage

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
but the nice thing is you can leverage

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.370 
but the nice thing is you can leverage
the<00:01:40.040> distortion<00:01:40.670> to<00:01:41.030> create<00:01:41.540> some<00:01:41.750> really

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
the distortion to create some really

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.070 
the distortion to create some really
interesting<00:01:42.500> effects<00:01:43.159> and<00:01:43.490> if<00:01:44.479> you<00:01:44.840> don't

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
interesting effects and if you don't

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.210 
interesting effects and if you don't
want<00:01:45.260> those<00:01:45.380> effects<00:01:45.770> you<00:01:45.890> can<00:01:46.070> always

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
want those effects you can always

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.430 
want those effects you can always
flatten<00:01:46.909> the<00:01:47.000> image<00:01:47.180> out<00:01:47.360> using<00:01:48.140> something

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
flatten the image out using something

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.149 
flatten the image out using something
like<00:01:48.580> Adobe<00:01:49.580> Lightroom<00:01:50.000> and<00:01:50.570> it<00:01:51.560> does<00:01:51.770> a<00:01:51.800> great

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
like Adobe Lightroom and it does a great

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:54.219 
like Adobe Lightroom and it does a great
job<00:01:52.310> of<00:01:52.610> minimizing<00:01:53.600> the<00:01:53.659> distortion<00:01:54.110> when

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
job of minimizing the distortion when

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.520 
job of minimizing the distortion when
you<00:01:54.320> use<00:01:54.500> that<00:01:54.909> so<00:01:55.909> one<00:01:56.420> thing<00:01:56.630> you<00:01:57.049> will<00:01:57.200> never

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
you use that so one thing you will never

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.770 
you use that so one thing you will never
get<00:01:57.799> with<00:01:57.920> this<00:01:58.070> lens<00:01:58.280> though<00:01:58.580> and<00:01:58.880> that's

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
get with this lens though and that's

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.950 
get with this lens though and that's
bokeh<00:02:00.320> but<00:02:01.250> when<00:02:02.180> you<00:02:02.270> expect<00:02:02.630> with<00:02:02.780> such<00:02:02.810> a

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
bokeh but when you expect with such a

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.219 
bokeh but when you expect with such a
wide-angle<00:02:03.260> lens<00:02:03.850> if<00:02:04.850> you<00:02:05.000> want<00:02:05.180> bokeh<00:02:05.420> you're

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
wide-angle lens if you want bokeh you're

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:07.870 
wide-angle lens if you want bokeh you're
gonna<00:02:06.350> have<00:02:06.590> to<00:02:06.770> look<00:02:07.190> for<00:02:07.430> it<00:02:07.490> in<00:02:07.580> something

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
gonna have to look for it in something

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.660 
gonna have to look for it in something
that's<00:02:08.539> a<00:02:09.019> lot<00:02:09.470> more<00:02:09.530> narrower<00:02:10.159> than<00:02:10.280> this<00:02:10.429> guy

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
that's a lot more narrower than this guy

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.350 
that's a lot more narrower than this guy
so<00:02:11.420> uh<00:02:11.450> for<00:02:12.379> all<00:02:12.500> you<00:02:12.650> video<00:02:13.370> offers<00:02:13.819> that<00:02:14.150> are

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
so uh for all you video offers that are

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.270 
so uh for all you video offers that are
out<00:02:14.540> there<00:02:14.569> what<00:02:15.440> I'm<00:02:15.500> gonna<00:02:15.650> do<00:02:15.830> is<00:02:15.980> I'm<00:02:16.190> gonna

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
out there what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.339 
out there what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
switch<00:02:16.760> my<00:02:17.239> lens<00:02:17.569> over<00:02:17.870> that<00:02:18.019> I'm<00:02:18.140> currently

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:18.349 
switch my lens over that I'm currently

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:21.580 
switch my lens over that I'm currently
using<00:02:18.530> on<00:02:19.159> my<00:02:19.370> camera<00:02:19.849> right<00:02:20.030> now<00:02:20.080> to<00:02:21.080> the<00:02:21.260> 14

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
using on my camera right now to the 14

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.319 
using on my camera right now to the 14
millimeter<00:02:22.040> so<00:02:22.189> you<00:02:22.249> can<00:02:22.400> see<00:02:22.609> what<00:02:22.790> a<00:02:22.819> huge

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:23.329 
millimeter so you can see what a huge

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:25.780 
millimeter so you can see what a huge
difference<00:02:23.659> it<00:02:24.409> makes<00:02:24.650> and<00:02:24.980> how<00:02:25.430> it<00:02:25.549> looks

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
difference it makes and how it looks

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:26.890 
difference it makes and how it looks
when<00:02:25.969> you're<00:02:26.060> recording<00:02:26.269> too

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
when you're recording too

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.809 
when you're recording too
and<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:28.050> camera<00:02:28.319> I'm<00:02:28.379> using<00:02:28.590> right<00:02:29.040> now<00:02:29.069> is<00:02:29.220> a

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
and the camera I'm using right now is a

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.339 
and the camera I'm using right now is a
Panasonic<00:02:30.330> af100

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
Panasonic af100

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:33.500 
Panasonic af100
so<00:02:32.010> there<00:02:32.190> is<00:02:32.400> a<00:02:32.430> bit<00:02:32.790> of<00:02:32.970> a<00:02:33.060> crop<00:02:33.269> factor

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
so there is a bit of a crop factor

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.780 
so there is a bit of a crop factor
happening<00:02:34.080> since<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:34.590> Micro<00:02:35.519> Four<00:02:35.760> Thirds

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
happening since the Micro Four Thirds

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.150 
happening since the Micro Four Thirds
sensor<00:02:36.269> and<00:02:36.810> it<00:02:36.930> is<00:02:37.019> smaller<00:02:37.830> than<00:02:38.099> a

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
sensor and it is smaller than a

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.869 
sensor and it is smaller than a
full-frame<00:02:39.150> sensor<00:02:40.160> so<00:02:41.160> let<00:02:41.580> me<00:02:41.640> go<00:02:41.700> ahead<00:02:41.730> and

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 
full-frame sensor so let me go ahead and

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:44.210 
full-frame sensor so let me go ahead and
stop<00:02:42.480> the<00:02:42.540> video<00:02:42.629> swap<00:02:43.260> this<00:02:43.380> in<00:02:43.590> and<00:02:43.800> you'll

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
stop the video swap this in and you'll

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.250 
stop the video swap this in and you'll
be<00:02:44.340> able<00:02:44.430> to<00:02:44.700> take<00:02:44.970> a<00:02:45.000> look<00:02:45.239> how<00:02:45.840> this<00:02:45.989> thing

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
be able to take a look how this thing

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:52.280 
be able to take a look how this thing
operates<00:02:46.500> with<00:02:47.010> video<00:02:50.209> okay<00:02:51.209> so<00:02:51.480> just<00:02:51.840> before

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
operates with video okay so just before

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.350 
operates with video okay so just before
we<00:02:52.470> get<00:02:52.590> into<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.130> 14<00:02:53.549> millimeter<00:02:53.940> I<00:02:54.060> wanted

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
we get into the 14 millimeter I wanted

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
we get into the 14 millimeter I wanted
to<00:02:54.420> kind<00:02:54.569> of<00:02:54.630> put<00:02:54.780> things<00:02:54.900> into<00:02:55.170> perspective

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
to kind of put things into perspective

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.670 
to kind of put things into perspective
so<00:02:56.370> right<00:02:56.790> now<00:02:56.970> this<00:02:57.450> is<00:02:57.629> a<00:02:57.660> lens<00:02:58.170> that<00:02:58.470> I'm

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
so right now this is a lens that I'm

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.430 
so right now this is a lens that I'm
sure<00:02:58.950> many<00:02:59.670> Nikon<00:03:00.150> users<00:03:00.569> and<00:03:00.959> actually<00:03:01.290> even

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
can expect when you throw a 50

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.110 
can expect when you throw a 50
millimeter<00:03:15.060> lens<00:03:15.569> on<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:16.500> panasonic<00:03:17.250> af100

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
millimeter lens on the panasonic af100

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.030 
millimeter lens on the panasonic af100
and<00:03:18.390> i'm<00:03:18.630> sitting<00:03:18.870> pretty<00:03:19.170> much<00:03:19.349> in<00:03:19.560> the<00:03:19.769> same

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
and i'm sitting pretty much in the same

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.220 
and i'm sitting pretty much in the same
spot<00:03:20.370> that<00:03:20.400> I'm<00:03:20.670> sitting<00:03:20.970> in<00:03:21.060> for<00:03:21.510> the<00:03:21.840> review

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
spot that I'm sitting in for the review

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.490 
spot that I'm sitting in for the review
so<00:03:22.980> for<00:03:23.700> the<00:03:23.790> for<00:03:24.180> the<00:03:24.269> earlier<00:03:24.480> segment<00:03:25.440> of

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
so for the for the earlier segment of

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.990 
so for the for the earlier segment of
this<00:03:25.590> review<00:03:25.890> so<00:03:26.459> that<00:03:26.640> will<00:03:26.730> kind<00:03:26.819> of<00:03:26.910> give

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
this review so that will kind of give

this review so that will kind of give
you<00:03:27.090> an<00:03:27.150> idea<00:03:27.209> like<00:03:27.569> how<00:03:27.810> how<00:03:28.140> much<00:03:28.260> closer<00:03:28.579> the

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
you an idea like how how much closer the

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.629 
you an idea like how how much closer the
50<00:03:30.239> millimeter<00:03:30.390> brings<00:03:31.049> the<00:03:31.859> subject<00:03:32.370> into

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:32.639 
50 millimeter brings the subject into

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:34.819 
50 millimeter brings the subject into
the<00:03:32.730> lens<00:03:32.959> so<00:03:33.959> just<00:03:34.470> for<00:03:34.560> the<00:03:34.650> sake<00:03:34.799> of

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
the lens so just for the sake of

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:37.370 
the lens so just for the sake of
comparison<00:03:35.220> I<00:03:35.609> went<00:03:35.970> ahead<00:03:36.030> and<00:03:36.510> threw<00:03:36.540> on<00:03:36.900> the

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
comparison I went ahead and threw on the

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.750 
comparison I went ahead and threw on the
Lumix<00:03:37.920> 12<00:03:38.489> to<00:03:38.900> 35<00:03:39.900> millimeter<00:03:40.440> zoom<00:03:40.829> lens<00:03:41.609> that

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
Lumix 12 to 35 millimeter zoom lens that

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.809 
Lumix 12 to 35 millimeter zoom lens that
I<00:03:41.790> have<00:03:42.030> that<00:03:42.359> it's<00:03:42.569> made<00:03:42.780> specifically<00:03:43.319> for

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:43.819 
I have that it's made specifically for

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:46.759 
I have that it's made specifically for
Micro<00:03:44.819> Four<00:03:45.329> Thirds<00:03:45.359> cameras<00:03:45.989> whereas<00:03:46.530> you

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
Micro Four Thirds cameras whereas you

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:49.729 
Micro Four Thirds cameras whereas you
know<00:03:46.889> obviously<00:03:47.340> the<00:03:48.090> 14<00:03:48.900> millimeter<00:03:49.290> Nikon

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
know obviously the 14 millimeter Nikon

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.030 
know obviously the 14 millimeter Nikon
and<00:03:50.100> the<00:03:51.000> Nikon<00:03:51.420> 50<00:03:51.690> millimeter<00:03:52.049> at<00:03:52.109> 1.5<00:03:52.620> are

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
and the Nikon 50 millimeter at 1.5 are

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.690 
and the Nikon 50 millimeter at 1.5 are
not<00:03:53.400> made<00:03:53.760> for<00:03:55.100> micro<00:03:56.100> four-thirds<00:03:56.489> or

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
not made for micro four-thirds or

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.879 
not made for micro four-thirds or
they're<00:03:57.000> meant<00:03:57.180> for<00:03:57.239> full-frame<00:03:57.900> sensors<00:03:58.530> so

00:03:58.879 --> 00:03:58.889 
they're meant for full-frame sensors so

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:01.039 
they're meant for full-frame sensors so
this<00:03:59.700> will<00:03:59.880> kind<00:04:00.060> of<00:04:00.090> give<00:04:00.150> you<00:04:00.299> an<00:04:00.389> idea<00:04:00.510> and

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
this will kind of give you an idea and

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:03.770 
this will kind of give you an idea and
this<00:04:01.829> by<00:04:02.069> the<00:04:02.130> way<00:04:02.280> is<00:04:02.400> it's<00:04:02.730> wide<00:04:03.299> open<00:04:03.660> right

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
this by the way is it's wide open right

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.319 
this by the way is it's wide open right
now<00:04:03.840> at<00:04:04.380> I<00:04:05.130> don't<00:04:05.549> mean<00:04:05.730> the<00:04:05.790> aperture<00:04:06.120> is<00:04:06.180> wide

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329 
now at I don't mean the aperture is wide

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:08.690 
now at I don't mean the aperture is wide
open<00:04:06.359> I<00:04:06.630> mean<00:04:06.780> that<00:04:06.930> it's<00:04:07.109> zoomed<00:04:07.920> all<00:04:08.250> the<00:04:08.310> way

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
open I mean that it's zoomed all the way

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.910 
open I mean that it's zoomed all the way
out<00:04:09.090> so<00:04:09.420> we're<00:04:09.569> at<00:04:09.690> 12<00:04:09.989> millimeters<00:04:10.470> right<00:04:10.709> now

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
out so we're at 12 millimeters right now

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.500 
out so we're at 12 millimeters right now
on<00:04:11.220> the<00:04:12.209> the<00:04:12.599> Panasonic<00:04:13.549> okay<00:04:14.549> so<00:04:14.880> here<00:04:15.389> we<00:04:15.420> are

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
on the the Panasonic okay so here we are

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.390 
on the the Panasonic okay so here we are
with<00:04:15.690> a<00:04:15.720> 14<00:04:16.049> millimeter<00:04:16.200> you<00:04:16.590> can<00:04:16.709> see<00:04:16.950> it's<00:04:17.280> a

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
with a 14 millimeter you can see it's a

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.020 
with a 14 millimeter you can see it's a
huge<00:04:18.269> difference<00:04:18.930> right<00:04:19.200> now<00:04:19.910> for<00:04:20.910> instance

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:21.030 
huge difference right now for instance

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.400 
huge difference right now for instance
the<00:04:21.510> the<00:04:21.780> lens<00:04:22.019> is<00:04:22.320> wide<00:04:22.349> open<00:04:23.180> it's<00:04:24.180> at<00:04:24.300> F<00:04:24.479> 2.8

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
the the lens is wide open it's at F 2.8

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.700 
the the lens is wide open it's at F 2.8
and<00:04:25.680> even<00:04:26.370> with<00:04:26.460> it<00:04:26.580> at<00:04:26.700> 2.8<00:04:27.479> the<00:04:28.200> depth<00:04:28.560> of

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
and even with it at 2.8 the depth of

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:30.650 
and even with it at 2.8 the depth of
field<00:04:28.950> is<00:04:29.160> so<00:04:29.669> extreme<00:04:30.090> that<00:04:30.120> when<00:04:30.450> I<00:04:30.479> was

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
field is so extreme that when I was

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.070 
field is so extreme that when I was
focusing<00:04:31.639> the<00:04:32.639> the<00:04:33.240> depth<00:04:33.539> of<00:04:33.630> field<00:04:33.840> was

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
focusing the the depth of field was

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.050 
focusing the the depth of field was
probably<00:04:34.500> from<00:04:34.650> somewhere<00:04:35.130> around<00:04:35.220> right

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
probably from somewhere around right

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.330 
probably from somewhere around right
