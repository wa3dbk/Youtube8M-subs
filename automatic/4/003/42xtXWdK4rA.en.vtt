looking<00:01:15.570> forward<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:16.020> attaching<00:01:16.830> is<00:01:17.100> I'm

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
looking forward to attaching is I'm

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.190 
looking forward to attaching is I'm
assuming<00:01:17.790> this<00:01:17.880> is<00:01:18.060> what<00:01:18.210> attaches<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:18.780> the

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
assuming this is what attaches to the

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.679 
assuming this is what attaches to the
here<00:01:19.979> this<00:01:20.220> is<00:01:20.340> actually<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.939> suction<00:01:21.479> part

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
here this is actually the suction part

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.960 
here this is actually the suction part
and<00:01:21.960> I'm<00:01:22.590> assuming<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:23.189> this<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.580> okay<00:01:23.909> so

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
and I'm assuming that this is okay so

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.340 
and I'm assuming that this is okay so
that's<00:01:24.360> what<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.869> is<00:01:24.960> so<00:01:25.140> it<00:01:25.259> basically

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
that's what it is so it basically

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.950 
that's what it is so it basically
swivels<00:01:26.159> out<00:01:26.310> like<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:27.450> thing<00:01:27.630> I<00:01:27.720> like

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
swivels out like that the thing I like

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.560 
swivels out like that the thing I like
about<00:01:27.990> this<00:01:28.470> is<00:01:28.710> that<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.700> really<00:01:30.210> looks<00:01:30.479> like

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
about this is that it really looks like

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.510 
about this is that it really looks like
it's<00:01:30.840> sturdy<00:01:31.200> a<00:01:31.350> lot<00:01:31.680> of<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:31.950> other<00:01:32.130> ones<00:01:32.369> that

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
it's sturdy a lot of the other ones that

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.700 
it's sturdy a lot of the other ones that
I've<00:01:32.670> used<00:01:33.060> or<00:01:33.509> that<00:01:33.540> I've<00:01:33.750> that<00:01:33.990> I've<00:01:34.259> tried

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
they they have a long arm and what ends

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.440 
they they have a long arm and what ends
up<00:01:37.799> happening<00:01:37.860> is<00:01:38.460> when<00:01:38.759> I<00:01:38.790> when<00:01:39.119> I<00:01:39.150> try<00:01:39.420> to

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
up happening is when I when I try to

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.080

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
movement of the car ends up causing the

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.789 
movement of the car ends up causing the
