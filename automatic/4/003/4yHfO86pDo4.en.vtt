00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:05.990 

so<00:00:04.589> what<00:00:04.920> we're<00:00:05.069> gonna<00:00:05.130> do<00:00:05.400> today<00:00:05.549> is<00:00:05.700> we're

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
so what we're gonna do today is we're

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.720 
so what we're gonna do today is we're
gonna<00:00:06.120> collect<00:00:06.600> the<00:00:06.810> gas<00:00:07.080> over<00:00:07.410> water<00:00:07.830> and<00:00:08.220> to

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
gonna collect the gas over water and to

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.730 
gonna collect the gas over water and to
do<00:00:08.880> so<00:00:09.059> we're<00:00:09.300> gonna<00:00:09.420> need<00:00:09.690> a<00:00:09.750> gas<00:00:10.200> forming

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
do so we're gonna need a gas forming

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.310 
do so we're gonna need a gas forming
reaction<00:00:11.340> so<00:00:12.030> what<00:00:12.179> I<00:00:12.210> have<00:00:12.480> here<00:00:12.509> is<00:00:12.929> a<00:00:12.960> piece

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
reaction so what I have here is a piece

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.650 
reaction so what I have here is a piece
of<00:00:13.349> magnesium<00:00:14.250> that<00:00:14.460> I<00:00:14.490> have<00:00:14.670> wound<00:00:15.089> in<00:00:15.540> a

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
of magnesium that I have wound in a

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.980 
of magnesium that I have wound in a
thread<00:00:16.049> and<00:00:16.470> tied<00:00:17.220> it<00:00:17.460> both<00:00:17.730> ends<00:00:18.270> so<00:00:18.960> that

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
thread and tied it both ends so that

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.470 
thread and tied it both ends so that
literally<00:00:19.470> I<00:00:19.859> can<00:00:20.279> hold<00:00:20.760> onto<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.119> piece<00:00:21.330> of

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
literally I can hold onto the piece of

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.070 
literally I can hold onto the piece of
magnesium<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.830> reason<00:00:23.250> for<00:00:23.430> this<00:00:23.609> is<00:00:23.880> as<00:00:24.510> the

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
magnesium the reason for this is as the

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.349 
magnesium the reason for this is as the
magnesium<00:00:25.590> reacts<00:00:25.920> hydrogen<00:00:26.789> bubbles<00:00:27.150> are

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
magnesium reacts hydrogen bubbles are

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.630 
magnesium reacts hydrogen bubbles are
gonna<00:00:27.420> form<00:00:27.810> on<00:00:28.019> it<00:00:28.199> making<00:00:29.039> it<00:00:29.130> very<00:00:29.279> light

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
gonna form on it making it very light

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.490 
gonna form on it making it very light
and<00:00:30.119> it's<00:00:30.330> gonna<00:00:30.480> tend<00:00:30.840> to<00:00:30.929> want<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.199> float

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
and it's gonna tend to want to float

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.290 
and it's gonna tend to want to float
away<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:32.070> stop<00:00:32.460> reacting<00:00:32.730> with<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.180> acid

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
away and stop reacting with the acid

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.250 
away and stop reacting with the acid
it's<00:00:33.780> so<00:00:34.710> I<00:00:34.980> like<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.309> secure<00:00:35.850> it<00:00:36.000> now<00:00:36.260> we're

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
it's so I like to secure it now we're

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.860 
it's so I like to secure it now we're
gonna<00:00:37.350> use<00:00:37.440> AUD<00:00:38.190> ometer<00:00:38.610> i<00:00:38.640> gas<00:00:39.059> form<00:00:39.480> into

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
gonna use AUD ometer i gas form into

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.619 
gonna use AUD ometer i gas form into
that<00:00:40.200> is<00:00:40.770> closed<00:00:41.340> at<00:00:41.550> one<00:00:41.760> end<00:00:41.790> open<00:00:42.420> at<00:00:42.540> the

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
that is closed at one end open at the

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.750 
that is closed at one end open at the
other<00:00:42.809> we're<00:00:43.710> gonna<00:00:43.800> fill<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.309> with<00:00:44.460> liquid

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
other we're gonna fill it with liquid

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.540 
other we're gonna fill it with liquid
and<00:00:45.300> we<00:00:46.079> are<00:00:46.200> going<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.469> place<00:00:46.710> our<00:00:46.920> magnesium

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
and we are going to place our magnesium

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.069 
and we are going to place our magnesium
inside<00:00:48.170> invert<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.590> place<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:50.460> in<00:00:50.789> water

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
inside invert it and place it in water

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:53.540 
inside invert it and place it in water
so<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.230> magnesium<00:00:52.620> will<00:00:53.010> end<00:00:53.160> up<00:00:53.309> at<00:00:53.460> the

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
so the magnesium will end up at the

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.630 
so the magnesium will end up at the
bottom<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.420> tube<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:55.649> acid<00:00:56.160> will<00:00:56.399> be<00:00:56.550> at

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
bottom of the tube the acid will be at

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.639 
bottom of the tube the acid will be at
the<00:00:56.789> top<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.300> tube<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.840> as<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.170> drifts

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
the top of the tube and as it drifts

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.860 
the top of the tube and as it drifts
down<00:00:58.890> because<00:00:59.550> it's<00:00:59.760> denser<00:01:00.000> it<00:01:00.600> will<00:01:00.719> begin

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
down because it's denser it will begin

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.619 
down because it's denser it will begin
to<00:01:01.230> react<00:01:01.500> with<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.800> magnesium<00:01:02.300> gas<00:01:03.300> will

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
to react with the magnesium gas will

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.200 
to react with the magnesium gas will
form<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.470> of<00:01:04.589> course<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.189> gas<00:01:05.400> will<00:01:05.670> rise<00:01:05.880> to

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
form and of course the gas will rise to

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.270 
form and of course the gas will rise to
the<00:01:06.330> tube<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:06.840> we<00:01:07.470> will<00:01:07.619> collect<00:01:07.860> it<00:01:08.070> over

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
the tube and we will collect it over

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.760 
the tube and we will collect it over
water<00:01:08.549> so<00:01:09.420> we<00:01:09.900> know<00:01:10.080> we're<00:01:10.260> gonna<00:01:10.350> have<00:01:10.439> two

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
water so we know we're gonna have two

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.500 
water so we know we're gonna have two
gases<00:01:11.369> in<00:01:11.520> this<00:01:11.610> tube<00:01:11.909> we're<00:01:12.180> gonna<00:01:12.270> have

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
gases in this tube we're gonna have

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.740 
gases in this tube we're gonna have
hydrogen<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.320> water<00:01:13.830> vapor<00:01:14.250> so<00:01:15.119> in<00:01:15.450> order<00:01:15.600> to

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
hydrogen and water vapor so in order to

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.440 
hydrogen and water vapor so in order to
do<00:01:15.990> this<00:01:16.229> we're<00:01:16.680> gonna<00:01:16.770> place<00:01:17.100> a<00:01:17.460> hydrochloric

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
do this we're gonna place a hydrochloric

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.850 
do this we're gonna place a hydrochloric
acid<00:01:18.869> that's<00:01:19.049> gonna<00:01:19.200> react<00:01:19.590> with<00:01:19.770> the

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
acid that's gonna react with the

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.910 
acid that's gonna react with the
magnesium<00:01:20.189> in<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.670> bottom<00:01:21.030> of<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.240> tube<00:01:21.920> take

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
magnesium in the bottom of the tube take

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.469 
magnesium in the bottom of the tube take
a<00:01:22.979> funnel<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:24.000> I'm<00:01:24.390> gonna<00:01:24.570> use<00:01:25.070> approximately

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
a funnel and I'm gonna use approximately

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.289 
a funnel and I'm gonna use approximately
approximately<00:01:27.680> 10<00:01:28.680> milliliters<00:01:29.400> so<00:01:29.430> 6<00:01:30.030> molar

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
approximately 10 milliliters so 6 molar

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.350 
approximately 10 milliliters so 6 molar
acid<00:01:30.840> never<00:01:31.619> pour<00:01:32.009> it<00:01:32.189> above<00:01:32.610> your<00:01:32.759> head<00:01:33.000> and

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
acid never pour it above your head and

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.870 
acid never pour it above your head and
you<00:01:33.420> should<00:01:33.689> be<00:01:33.840> wearing<00:01:34.049> goggles<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:35.100> I<00:01:35.579> will

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
you should be wearing goggles and I will

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.649 
you should be wearing goggles and I will
as<00:01:36.090> well<00:01:36.270> so<00:01:37.259> over<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.189> sink<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:38.820> below<00:01:39.509> eye

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
as well so over a sink and below eye

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.569 
as well so over a sink and below eye
level<00:01:39.950> you<00:01:40.950> will<00:01:41.100> add<00:01:41.570> about<00:01:42.570> 10<00:01:42.899> milliliters

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
level you will add about 10 milliliters

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:47.420 
level you will add about 10 milliliters
10<00:01:44.579> milliliters<00:01:45.149> will<00:01:45.659> be<00:01:45.840> excess<00:01:46.439> so<00:01:46.920> we

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
10 milliliters will be excess so we

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.700 
10 milliliters will be excess so we
don't<00:01:47.670> have<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:48.119> measure<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.450> carefully<00:01:49.200> I've

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
don't have to measure it carefully I've

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:50.899 
don't have to measure it carefully I've
got<00:01:50.009> about<00:01:50.189> 10

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
got about 10

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.450 
got about 10
leaders<00:01:51.210> of<00:01:51.420> acid<00:01:51.840> here<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.409> there<00:01:53.340> are

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
leaders of acid here and there are

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.880 
leaders of acid here and there are
markings<00:01:53.969> on<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.630> yo-yo<00:01:54.810> meter<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:55.469> tell<00:01:55.740> me

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
markings on the yo-yo meter that tell me

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.690 
markings on the yo-yo meter that tell me
how<00:01:56.039> much<00:01:56.219> I<00:01:56.460> have<00:01:56.719> now<00:01:57.719> I'm<00:01:57.869> ready<00:01:58.109> to<00:01:58.700> fill

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
how much I have now I'm ready to fill

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.630 
how much I have now I'm ready to fill
the<00:01:59.909> rest<00:02:00.119> with<00:02:00.299> water<00:02:01.039> because<00:02:02.039> of<00:02:02.069> course<00:02:02.429> we

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
the rest with water because of course we

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.969 
the rest with water because of course we
can't<00:02:02.909> start<00:02:03.299> with<00:02:03.630> any<00:02:03.810> gas<00:02:04.109> in<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.530> tube<00:02:04.709> it

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
can't start with any gas in the tube it

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.699 
can't start with any gas in the tube it
must<00:02:05.340> be<00:02:05.490> filled<00:02:05.759> entirely<00:02:06.179> with<00:02:06.329> water<00:02:06.719> so<00:02:07.679> I

00:02:07.699 --> 00:02:07.709 
must be filled entirely with water so I

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:09.949 
must be filled entirely with water so I
will<00:02:08.069> carefully<00:02:08.610> pour<00:02:08.910> water<00:02:09.269> down<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.929> side

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
will carefully pour water down the side

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.280 
will carefully pour water down the side
of<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:11.030> water<00:02:12.030> is<00:02:12.269> less<00:02:12.540> dense<00:02:12.870> than<00:02:13.230> the

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
of the to water is less dense than the

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.920 
of the to water is less dense than the
acid<00:02:13.769> solution<00:02:13.950> so<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.879> water<00:02:15.150> should<00:02:15.599> be<00:02:15.780> on

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
acid solution so the water should be on

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.869 
acid solution so the water should be on
top<00:02:16.200> at<00:02:16.470> this<00:02:16.590> point<00:02:18.110> and<00:02:19.129> what<00:02:20.129> it's<00:02:20.250> entirely

amount of hydrogen gas

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.449 
amount of hydrogen gas
but<00:03:09.989> of<00:03:10.109> course<00:03:10.139> remember<00:03:11.010> there's<00:03:11.250> also

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
but of course remember there's also

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.960 
but of course remember there's also
water<00:03:11.880> vapor<00:03:12.359> in<00:03:12.690> here<00:03:13.019> now<00:03:13.829> if<00:03:14.310> I'm<00:03:14.579> gonna<00:03:14.760> do

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
water vapor in here now if I'm gonna do

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.300 
water vapor in here now if I'm gonna do
some<00:03:15.209> stoichiometry<00:03:15.450> and<00:03:16.380> calculate<00:03:17.130> how

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
some stoichiometry and calculate how

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.089 
some stoichiometry and calculate how
much<00:03:17.459> magnesium<00:03:17.910> we<00:03:18.299> reacted<00:03:18.930> I'm<00:03:19.620> gonna<00:03:19.919> need

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.099 
much magnesium we reacted I'm gonna need

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:22.280 
much magnesium we reacted I'm gonna need
to<00:03:20.280> know<00:03:20.310> how<00:03:20.760> much<00:03:20.910> hydrogen<00:03:21.269> gas<00:03:21.690> is<00:03:21.989> in<00:03:22.139> this

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
to know how much hydrogen gas is in this

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.819 
to know how much hydrogen gas is in this
too<00:03:22.530> so<00:03:23.459> here's<00:03:23.970> what<00:03:24.180> I<00:03:24.209> do<00:03:24.349> first<00:03:25.349> I<00:03:25.620> looked

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
too so here's what I do first I looked

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:29.120 
too so here's what I do first I looked
at<00:03:25.980> tooth<00:03:26.130> puffs<00:03:26.569> place<00:03:27.569> my<00:03:27.870> thumb<00:03:28.169> over<00:03:28.620> the

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
at tooth puffs place my thumb over the

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.970 
at tooth puffs place my thumb over the
tube<00:03:29.459> and<00:03:30.019> so<00:03:31.019> that<00:03:31.169> nothing<00:03:31.500> gets<00:03:31.620> in<00:03:31.829> or<00:03:31.950> out

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
tube and so that nothing gets in or out

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.460 
tube and so that nothing gets in or out
there's<00:03:32.639> no<00:03:32.849> air<00:03:33.180> at<00:03:33.389> it<00:03:33.630> I<00:03:33.780> still<00:03:34.079> just<00:03:34.109> have

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
there's no air at it I still just have

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:35.309 
there's no air at it I still just have
hydrogen

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
hydrogen

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.479 
hydrogen
our<00:03:35.499> vapor<00:03:35.909> then<00:03:36.909> I<00:03:36.999> lift<00:03:37.299> up<00:03:37.920> and<00:03:38.920> place<00:03:39.219> it

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
our vapor then I lift up and place it

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:42.809 
our vapor then I lift up and place it
down<00:03:39.760> inside<00:03:40.450> a<00:03:40.920> graduated<00:03:41.920> cylinder<00:03:42.129> that<00:03:42.760> is

down inside a graduated cylinder that is

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:45.479 
down inside a graduated cylinder that is
filled<00:03:43.239> with<00:03:43.359> water<00:03:43.709> now<00:03:44.709> what's<00:03:45.159> the<00:03:45.310> point

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
filled with water now what's the point

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.959 
filled with water now what's the point
of<00:03:45.670> that<00:03:45.700> you<00:03:45.999> ask<00:03:46.209> well<00:03:46.870> I<00:03:47.159> do<00:03:48.159> know<00:03:48.670> the

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:48.969 
of that you ask well I do know the

00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:51.390 
of that you ask well I do know the
temperature<00:03:49.450> of<00:03:49.569> this<00:03:49.689> gas<00:03:49.959> it<00:03:50.799> should<00:03:51.099> be<00:03:51.249> the

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
temperature of this gas it should be the

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.699 
temperature of this gas it should be the
same<00:03:51.639> as<00:03:51.879> the<00:03:52.060> temperature<00:03:52.299> of<00:03:52.719> the<00:03:52.840> water<00:03:53.049> in

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
same as the temperature of the water in

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:55.949 
same as the temperature of the water in
which<00:03:54.010> the<00:03:54.250> reaction<00:03:54.700> occurred<00:03:55.060> so<00:03:55.719> if<00:03:55.840> I

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
which the reaction occurred so if I

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:58.229 
which the reaction occurred so if I
simply<00:03:56.530> measure<00:03:56.829> the<00:03:57.219> temperature<00:03:57.730> of<00:03:58.090> the

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
simply measure the temperature of the

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.209 
simply measure the temperature of the
beaker<00:03:58.629> I'll<00:03:59.079> know<00:03:59.379> the<00:03:59.409> temperature<00:04:00.040> of<00:04:00.069> the

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:00.219 
beaker I'll know the temperature of the

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:02.610 
beaker I'll know the temperature of the
gas<00:04:00.250> in<00:04:00.730> here<00:04:01.030> I<00:04:01.209> also<00:04:01.840> need<00:04:02.169> to<00:04:02.200> know<00:04:02.409> its

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
gas in here I also need to know its

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.860 
gas in here I also need to know its
volume<00:04:03.099> and<00:04:03.310> its<00:04:03.430> pressure<00:04:03.760> now<00:04:04.299> you<00:04:04.689> may<00:04:04.840> be

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
volume and its pressure now you may be

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.300 
volume and its pressure now you may be
saying<00:04:05.139> how<00:04:05.379> do<00:04:05.439> I<00:04:05.530> know<00:04:05.650> the<00:04:05.829> pressure<00:04:06.069> of

saying how do I know the pressure of

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.759 
saying how do I know the pressure of
that<00:04:06.459> gas<00:04:06.519> in<00:04:06.969> there<00:04:07.180> well<00:04:07.959> if<00:04:08.290> we<00:04:08.500> know<00:04:08.650> the

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
that gas in there well if we know the

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:10.619 
that gas in there well if we know the
pressure<00:04:08.919> of<00:04:09.280> the<00:04:09.370> room<00:04:09.609> we<00:04:10.209> can<00:04:10.389> determine

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:10.629 
pressure of the room we can determine

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:12.899 
pressure of the room we can determine
the<00:04:10.900> pressure<00:04:11.139> of<00:04:11.500> the<00:04:11.590> gas<00:04:11.769> in<00:04:12.219> the<00:04:12.400> tube

00:04:12.899 --> 00:04:12.909 
the pressure of the gas in the tube

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:15.330 
the pressure of the gas in the tube
currently<00:04:13.840> the<00:04:14.139> level<00:04:14.439> of<00:04:14.530> water<00:04:14.739> in<00:04:14.980> the<00:04:15.099> tube

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
currently the level of water in the tube

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.069 
currently the level of water in the tube
is<00:04:15.549> higher<00:04:15.879> than<00:04:16.299> the<00:04:16.419> level<00:04:16.599> of<00:04:16.810> water

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 
is higher than the level of water

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:19.830 
is higher than the level of water
outside<00:04:17.650> the<00:04:18.070> tube<00:04:18.280> the<00:04:19.239> atmosphere<00:04:19.750> is

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
outside the tube the atmosphere is

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.020 
outside the tube the atmosphere is
pushing<00:04:20.019> down<00:04:20.410> on<00:04:20.440> the<00:04:20.739> water<00:04:20.769> outside<00:04:21.579> the

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
pushing down on the water outside the

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.480 
pushing down on the water outside the
tube<00:04:22.270> the<00:04:23.020> gas<00:04:23.259> is<00:04:23.620> pressing<00:04:24.099> down<00:04:24.310> on<00:04:24.340> the

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
tube the gas is pressing down on the

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.360 
tube the gas is pressing down on the

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
water inside the tube and the gas inside

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.089 
water inside the tube and the gas inside
the<00:04:27.580> tube<00:04:27.820> isn't<00:04:28.060> pushing<00:04:28.660> as<00:04:28.810> hard<00:04:28.840> as<00:04:29.830> the

00:04:30.089 --> 00:04:30.099 
the tube isn't pushing as hard as the

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:33.060 
the tube isn't pushing as hard as the
gas<00:04:30.280> outside<00:04:30.580> the<00:04:31.000> tube<00:04:31.210> that's<00:04:32.020> because<00:04:32.530> the

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:33.070 
gas outside the tube that's because the

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.070 
gas outside the tube that's because the
level<00:04:33.370> of<00:04:33.430> water's<00:04:33.759> higher<00:04:34.030> inside<00:04:34.630> than<00:04:34.930> out

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
level of water's higher inside than out

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.900 
level of water's higher inside than out
it's<00:04:35.410> a<00:04:35.530> push<00:04:35.800> of<00:04:35.979> War<00:04:36.220> between<00:04:36.759> the

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
it's a push of War between the

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.850 
it's a push of War between the
atmosphere<00:04:37.479> and<00:04:37.509> the<00:04:37.870> gas<00:04:38.050> we've<00:04:38.320> collected

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
atmosphere and the gas we've collected

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.170 
atmosphere and the gas we've collected
so<00:04:39.520> what<00:04:39.669> I<00:04:39.699> do<00:04:39.820> is<00:04:40.060> I<00:04:40.210> lower<00:04:40.570> the<00:04:41.320> two<00:04:42.000> so<00:04:43.000> that

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
so what I do is I lower the two so that

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.350 
so what I do is I lower the two so that
the<00:04:43.240> level<00:04:43.599> of<00:04:43.900> water<00:04:44.139> inside<00:04:45.009> and<00:04:45.070> outside<00:04:45.610> is

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
the level of water inside and outside is

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.499 
the level of water inside and outside is
identical<00:04:47.169> and<00:04:47.409> that<00:04:47.470> means<00:04:48.400> the<00:04:48.940> pressure<00:04:49.240> of

00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:49.509 
identical and that means the pressure of

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:51.540 
identical and that means the pressure of
the<00:04:49.630> gas<00:04:49.780> in<00:04:50.080> this<00:04:50.259> tube<00:04:50.530> is<00:04:50.770> the<00:04:50.800> same<00:04:51.220> as<00:04:51.430> the

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
the gas in this tube is the same as the

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.670 
the gas in this tube is the same as the
pressure<00:04:51.820> in<00:04:52.030> the<00:04:52.150> room<00:04:52.330> all<00:04:52.990> we<00:04:53.259> need<00:04:53.470> to<00:04:53.500> do

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
pressure in the room all we need to do

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.129 
pressure in the room all we need to do
is<00:04:53.919> check<00:04:54.159> a<00:04:54.220> barometer<00:04:54.490> and<00:04:55.270> not<00:04:55.659> only<00:04:55.780> do<00:04:56.050> you

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:56.139 
is check a barometer and not only do you

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:57.779 
is check a barometer and not only do you
know<00:04:56.229> the<00:04:56.380> pressure<00:04:56.860> in<00:04:57.009> the<00:04:57.130> room<00:04:57.280> we<00:04:57.610> now

00:04:57.779 --> 00:04:57.789 
know the pressure in the room we now

00:04:57.789 --> 00:04:59.790 
know the pressure in the room we now
know<00:04:58.030> the<00:04:58.180> pressure<00:04:58.449> inside<00:04:58.930> the<00:04:59.169> tube<00:04:59.380> and

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
know the pressure inside the tube and

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.279 
know the pressure inside the tube and
this<00:05:00.639> is<00:05:00.699> the<00:05:00.909> volume<00:05:01.240> I<00:05:01.630> want<00:05:01.659> to<00:05:02.050> measure

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:02.289 
this is the volume I want to measure

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:04.950 
this is the volume I want to measure
where<00:05:02.919> I<00:05:02.949> know<00:05:03.130> the<00:05:03.610> pressure<00:05:03.880> because<00:05:04.690> five

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
where I know the pressure because five

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.930 
where I know the pressure because five
radius<00:05:05.560> and<00:05:05.710> lower<00:05:05.889> this<00:05:06.039> tube<00:05:06.310> I<00:05:06.520> notice<00:05:06.820> the

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
radius and lower this tube I notice the

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.420 
radius and lower this tube I notice the
volume<00:05:07.090> keeps<00:05:07.599> changing<00:05:07.990> and<00:05:08.470> that's<00:05:09.220> of

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
volume keeps changing and that's of

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.460 
volume keeps changing and that's of
course<00:05:09.460> according<00:05:10.419> Boyle's<00:05:10.990> law<00:05:11.050> were

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
course according Boyle's law were

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.800 
course according Boyle's law were
increasing<00:05:12.370> and<00:05:12.550> decreasing<00:05:12.699> pressure<00:05:13.479> by

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
increasing and decreasing pressure by

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.469 
increasing and decreasing pressure by
doing<00:05:14.139> this<00:05:14.320> and<00:05:14.680> so<00:05:15.580> of<00:05:15.639> course<00:05:15.729> we're

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:16.479 
doing this and so of course we're

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:19.140 
doing this and so of course we're
decreasing<00:05:16.930> and<00:05:17.320> increasing<00:05:17.470> our<00:05:17.979> volume<00:05:18.400> so

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
decreasing and increasing our volume so

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.029 
decreasing and increasing our volume so
if<00:05:19.300> I<00:05:19.449> know<00:05:19.509> the<00:05:19.840> pressure<00:05:19.870> when<00:05:20.530> the<00:05:20.650> levels

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:21.039 
if I know the pressure when the levels

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:24.240 
if I know the pressure when the levels
of<00:05:21.250> water<00:05:21.490> are<00:05:21.789> equal<00:05:22.320> that's<00:05:23.320> the<00:05:23.770> volume<00:05:23.949> I

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 
of water are equal that's the volume I

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.730 
of water are equal that's the volume I
want<00:05:24.280> to<00:05:24.550> measure<00:05:24.729> I<00:05:25.090> look<00:05:25.539> down<00:05:25.840> and<00:05:26.169> see<00:05:26.530> what

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740 
want to measure I look down and see what

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:27.250 
want to measure I look down and see what
volume
