00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.210
 old number 4 the face of desmond and 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.760

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.430
 very distant relatives like the 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:01.309
 rest of the main killers number 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:04.039

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.960
 an error of animus number 6 

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:08.539
 assassin's creed was parodied by the 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.909

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.450
 he is the only one who has killed all his 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.400
 enemies since the other murderers are 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.490
