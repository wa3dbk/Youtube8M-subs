 I have several types of them 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.920
 The first kind is such a purchase box in 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.610
 which went to store in the hallway different 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.160
 children's hats and adult hats near 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.180
 worth the same box for 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.270
 shure me not marmots but rather gloves 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:06.000
 seals you some small scarves 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:08.790
 Children here are very comfortable it can be 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.150
 put on the shelf and it's compact 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.870
 There are so many such pens as promote 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.150
 you can push 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:22.820
 the next box is homemade 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:25.520
 box here is such a box if you 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.690
 I wonder how to make such a box 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:32.210
 go to the master class 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:34.630
 I will leave the link in the description and maybe here 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.770
 I'll leave here 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:40.340
 image on which you can click and 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.290
 go to the video where can i story i 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.390
 telling how to do this 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:49.280
 a box with your own hands from a simple 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:52.070
 carton box for from all sorts of things 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:55.070
 me this box was due to shcherba or 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.090
 something like that here I have stored 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.220
 Kids' things 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.550
 but at the same short with me 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:06.140
 my materials are kept for the master class 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:07.520
 all sorts of scissors paint and tassels there and 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.060
 everything and everything like that 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:14.420
 what is very convenient it can be put on 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:17.290
 open living room shelf and nobody 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.840
 I think that it is you purchase it 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.590
 homemade box she is very 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.980
 presentable seems to me to look 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:27.230
 especially from afar thoughts are not there 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:31.310
 peering that is of course a little 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:35.440
 it is clear that she 's glued it all 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:37.459
 things but so far away is very beautiful 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:42.769
 The following really want to tell you 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:45.350
 this is such an organizer for scarves he 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:49.370
 very convenient so that you can hang 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:52.480
 all your scarves that you have and 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.480
 even of glasses 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:03:01.440
 scarves are very convenient to take from here and he 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.360
 takes up little space because he 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.360
 hangs on the bar where your hanging 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.300
 outerwear 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:11.190
 your dressing room or in the hallway therefore 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.459
 its very convenient to use and easy 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:17.819
 a find for me was such a way 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:20.580
 bought it on buyincoins whether ca cha i 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:22.620
 I want to tell it will be vacuum 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:26.370
 storage bags 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:31.760
 I have such blue packets here 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:38.250
 clasp and here's such a valve for 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:41.640
 blowing air with a vacuum cleaner one 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:44.180
 the valve opens the inserted vacuum cleaner 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:49.489
 the vacuum cleaner turns on 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:52.590
 all air from the bag is exhausted and 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:56.519
 the valve is sealed I 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:04:00.120
 I use them for stored winter clothes 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:04.010
 for example, in summer, in summer, I clean all winter 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:07.440
 things such bags sealed close 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:11.250
 vacuuming them they decrease 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:13.530
 really twice and where where are you 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.769
 could put two packages like this 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:21.120
 things ordinary packages for example with things 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:24.840
 there now fit these four in the same 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:27.690
 your very mezzanine too 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:30.930
 it is very convenient to buy these packages on 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:33.660
 amazon but I actually saw these 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:37.320

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:39.990

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.120
 In the news, too, by the way, video and package but 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.120
 It seems to me a smaller size that is 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:47.750
 you can find think if you aim 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:51.360
