00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.419
 ok today we will learn to make some weights 

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:07.160
 Hexagonal homemade cement as 

00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:09.410
 from gyms the first thing that 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.580
 we need is an aluminum sheet 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.160
 that you can buy it at any 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.950
 hardware store as thin as possible 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.109
 You need that is so thick I will 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.960
 I will leave the molds in the description 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:23.000
 to download them in pdf of the 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.390
 hexagons that are already ready only 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.090
 is to print them and they will be more 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.519
 or less in this way each mold 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.899
 clipped and done what they see here are 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:37.309
 the strips that have to cut 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:40.870
 laterals of the sides of each hexagon 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:44.030
 according to the side you want to do there 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.920
 look at it in today's description I'm going 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.410
 commenting how they do this this 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.000
 example is 12 centimeters long or 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.289
 be that the strip should be 12 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.300
 centimeters long 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:57.109
 this one is 7 centimeters long I 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:59.920
 I will explain in detail this is 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:02.899
 the base already cut from the foil 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.460
 used then here already these are some 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:05.970
 molds that I already have ready to start 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.310
 to do my 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.740
 hexagonal pieces all remain of the 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:15.090
 same height the only thing that changes is the 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:19.790
 length of the side that is in accordance 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:22.040
 to the width of each hexagon the 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.410
 centimeter of the hexagonal pool 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:28.940
 this is a this that I use to 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:31.530
 measure sand and cement I use three 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.320
 sand stockings by two cement 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.470
 then I'm taking out the cement from the 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.290
 sand made the first batch first 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.670
 of sand with the measure you just saw 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.160
 with the car you can use 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.580
 any jar provided that they are three 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:50.250
 sand measurements and two cement I'll 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:53.630
 adding one over another first I start 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.820
 with sand cement sand cement 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.590
 I come back and finished with the sand that is the 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:03.460
 last I have here 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:06.609
 I have already started the process of mixing water 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:09.009
 more or less the buoy throwing the go 

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:11.319
 adding determining that the mixture does not 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.660
 it's going to be like this very very liquid 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:17.379
 that we arrived then we went to what is 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.720
 the part of the bar that I use a 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:22.780
 ppc when the weights are not so heavy 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.370
 of five of six kilos used a pvc already 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.319
 the largest prey is used a 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:30.400
 iron bar 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:33.139
 the cut that I make is 10 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.409
 centimeters from the base I 'm going 

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:38.069
 leaving the explanation little by little 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:42.749
 measurements and everything 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:46.799
 I make a hole more or less in the 

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:49.739
 half to 5 centimeters from the end to 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:51.420
 introduce a screw this tournament I 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.969
 will serve them a little bit 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.120
 anchoring to avoid that with the 

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:59.069
 time the piece will be released 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.519
 so then in a screw more or less 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:04.680
 long and thick I put a screw 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:07.639
 more or less thick no matter what type 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:12.900
 of screw be next step 

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:14.129
 I open the mixture in the mold and with 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.879
 a piece of foil 

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:19.500
 I make a center tried to cut the measure 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:22.650
 or make a small cut to 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.980
 determine the center of some cross in 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.500
 the center I immediately enter the 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.169
 pvc tube to the bottom left 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.060
 well well centered here you make a 

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:35.939
 top view so they can see what's left 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:38.609
 well fine in the center once finished 

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:41.760
 and already done both sides dry then that 

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:44.850
 is how is the piece and can you 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.670
 take a graffiti if you want 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:51.140
 and this is my collection of pieces that I've 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:53.550
 made of 13 of 8 of 6 of 11 kilos 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.620
 I use some cars also for some 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.090
 lighter in case they want 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.090
 work with weights a politician more 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:03.780
 light weight for women weighing 3 kilos 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:06.300
 32 maximum of 36 I also use 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:09.570
 small flour sacks to make 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:14.390
 it is overloading a politician more more 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:17.310
 specific I use a car tire 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.500
 to fill it sand that weighs 10 kilos and 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:22.530
 this is going to be the next tutorial 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:25.380
 teach them how to make a support for 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.340
 to do push-ups to do the 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.810
 chest lessons 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:33.500
 thank you very much comment and subscribe
