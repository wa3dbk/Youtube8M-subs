00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:12.580
 yes the intro without sound no hearty 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:13.990
 Welcoming Mario at the beginning of the 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.600
 most of you will probably 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:19.690
 have already noticed that saturo 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.880
 iwata the president of nintendo am 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:25.539
 last saturday aged 55 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:28.000
 years has died and thus a very 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:30.070
 great and important man for the 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.890
 industry but also an incredibly great 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:36.610
 personality has gone from us and 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:39.250
 we want from tape.tv from tellyou.de 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.250
 use this video to thank you for that 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.870
 I do not agree anymore personally 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.270
 also like i already wrote if 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.910
 I do not always an opinion was not 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.890
 always what good he found with and for 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.860
 nintendo did because he did 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.590
 undeniably one of the very big in 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.660
 not just because he has the industry 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.109
 company made extremely successful 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.539
 Has 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:04.570
 with the right nose what ds and wii 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:07.510
 but also because he is very close 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:10.240
 was in his direct presentation 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.010
 last really almost to the end 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.180
 a few weeks ago still on the 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:18.640
 e3 really great tried the fans 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.160
 from the very top of the company management too 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.590
 show that he the saying he times 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:26.620
 actually said means namely on 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.780
 the business card a boss in the head 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.390
 a game developer but in the heart of the 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.370
 hearts gamer that he said that 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.710
 meant really seriously and also 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.970
 understood what it means in this 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.580
 industry 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.620
 he was one of the very complete ones for me 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.260
 great, very important personalities 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:47.080
 and not only leaves behind at nintendo 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:50.710
 As a company, a huge gap 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.570
 which makes it faster this difficult 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.480
 if not impossible this 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.510
 at some point to fill and the 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.280
 especially for the company an important 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.220
 leading figure and one 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:06.810
 a kind of mission statement or icon almost already 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:08.880
 takes a lot of hiding behind 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.120
 everything that distinguished Nintendo 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:15.180
 saturo iwata he was in the lead 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.370
 in everything with it and has nintendo too 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.080
 What made it in recent years 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.380
 even if it is in the nintendo today 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.959
 he does not feel so good at the moment 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.300
 nevertheless , he is the right one 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.640
 gone right and I can 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:34.890
 just my main bow before him and 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:36.540
 Although really deep in the deepest 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.450
 bow as I can only until the 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.910
 ground 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.459
 it hurts me in the heart no nintendo 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.310
 to see more with saturo iwata directly 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:50.459
 can not be more friendly 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:53.550
 cheerful and always relaxed style 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.989
 to be able to perceive and he will me 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.600
 personally even if I personally 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:00.269
 but he did not know me personally 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.700
 it's really missing for nintendo 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:04.560
 really hard to get there 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.110
 suitable successor to find the one 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.880
 similar about a similar profile 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.290
 and that will do it 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.239
 Maybe someday gap 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.150
 close and again such 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:18.200
 Identification figure for Nintendo too 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:20.519
 that's still one of the ones for me 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.269
 best company is if you like that 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.280
 can say 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:24.930
 hardly any other company has it 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.010
 done in my life for so much 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.829
 to provide fun 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:33.000
 and I hope that it continues with it 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:37.530
 and that nintendo survives that well 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:40.530
 this terrible event and that 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.690
 yes, even if it will not see any Japanese 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.900
 Of course, my personal condolences go 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.880
 to the family to the relatives and to 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:53.280
 his friends to his colleagues 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:54.870
 and yes I hope that at least for 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.770
 the closer they were not too 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.240
 surprised 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.880
 or not quite as surprising as came 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.950
 for us a few weeks ago was yes 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.280
 still or it looked like everything was 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.690
 again in order 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.820
 not only i want to use this video 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.590
 to take a short position but ore 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.240
 gunnar also has another one for the second 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.360
 short video taken what I now 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:18.030
 here in hindsight will install and 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.549
 In addition, the on kino.de in the forum 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:23.700
 open an obituary red with the 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:26.520
 this video begins and where you the 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:29.280
 possibility have your condolences 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:32.070
 and express your opinion to him 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.590
 just write about him for me 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.720
 believe it is important as it is me 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.160
 personally very important at least 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:42.450
 one thinks of the people in the heart 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:45.870
 reserves and yes that is me personally 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:48.690
 and that is why I am applying this 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:52.380
 video with a smile handed angola 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:55.530
 and annoying for you the track in the forum 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:59.400
 where you like to be in this epitaph 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:01.380
 satoru iwata is dead 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.910
 and so is a very special one 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.730
 company president left us because 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:07.470
 heart made the international 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:08.720
 acting large corporation nintendo a 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.740
 to give soul 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:14.520
 reputable on one side of his 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:17.160
 sneak suit fender finally reaches 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.660
 on the other hand authentic whole 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.820
 especially catchword because you have it too 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.770
 each time that he taken for the 1 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.820
 what he does what he says he says 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.200
 I think I have to think that he 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:27.600
 always tried somehow a balancing act 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.830
 to create around the major shareholder 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.060
 shareholders are satisfied on the one hand 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.620
 but also the fans are satisfied 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.270
 put on the other side of course 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.650
 he did not always succeed he has the 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.600
 a side of head bumped walter 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:39.660
 but not others, we only take that 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:41.520
 example that the world has been for years 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.990
 who divorced until 2000 years ago 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.120
 tennis or bitterfield game go the 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.500
 Please do not play to make consoles 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:49.260
 can only make a console more 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:51.000
 catchable publication standard 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.740
 remained although the share price 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.030
 harmed first standard 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.040
 and that has done better because he 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:57.660
 knew that against the 

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.550
 company tradition is and above all 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:01.110
 that hardly any tenno fan 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:02.760
 been happy when nintendo 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.810
 suddenly announcing calm we do 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.330
 do not make more consoles 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:07.610
 this steadfastness is definitely something 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:10.159
 I have admired 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:12.439
 satoru iwata leaves a big 

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:14.719
 Vacuum leaves a vacuum with endo 

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:16.599
 but he leaves a vacuum entire 

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:18.650
 gaming world and it really is 

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:19.849
 to be interesting to see that 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:23.900
 can be filled so fast at all 

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:25.969
 He will definitely be missed and well off 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:29.229
 before his performance and before his 

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:29.229
 humanity in such a position
