00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.380 
is really easy guys you only need two
ingredients<00:02:21.910> baby<00:02:22.720> powder<00:02:23.050> and<00:02:23.790> water<00:02:24.790> so<00:02:25.300> I'm

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
ingredients baby powder and water so I'm

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.140 
ingredients baby powder and water so I'm
going<00:02:25.569> to<00:02:25.599> fill<00:02:25.780> it<00:02:25.900> up<00:02:25.989> and<00:02:26.670> you<00:02:27.670> can<00:02:27.790> choose

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
going to fill it up and you can choose

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.270 
going to fill it up and you can choose
however<00:02:28.900> much<00:02:29.680> you<00:02:29.860> want

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
however much you want

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.190 
however much you want
so<00:02:30.430> I<00:02:30.459> filled<00:02:30.910> it<00:02:31.030> up<00:02:31.120> I<00:02:31.390> don't<00:02:31.930> know<00:02:32.019> if<00:02:32.110> you

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
so I filled it up I don't know if you

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.339 
so I filled it up I don't know if you
can<00:02:32.380> tell<00:02:32.620> how<00:02:32.980> far<00:02:33.340> it's<00:02:33.489> filled<00:02:33.760> up<00:02:33.970> but<00:02:34.349> so

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
can tell how far it's filled up but so

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:38.070 
can tell how far it's filled up but so
the<00:02:35.500> pre<00:02:35.680> for<00:02:35.860> now<00:02:36.459> I'm<00:02:36.580> going<00:02:36.760> to<00:02:36.880> take<00:02:37.090> the

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
the pre for now I'm going to take the

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.770 
the pre for now I'm going to take the
baby<00:02:38.440> powder<00:02:38.680> that<00:02:39.160> I<00:02:39.220> just<00:02:39.730> put<00:02:40.150> into<00:02:40.660> this

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
baby powder that I just put into this

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.449 
baby powder that I just put into this
cup<00:02:41.049> and<00:02:41.760> I<00:02:43.380> guess<00:02:44.380> I<00:02:44.500> should<00:02:44.530> measure<00:02:44.890> this<00:02:45.250> in

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
cup and I guess I should measure this in

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:54.930 
cup and I guess I should measure this in
like<00:02:45.670> a<00:02:45.700> spoon<00:02:46.680> but<00:02:47.680> I<00:02:48.840> won't<00:02:51.900> but<00:02:53.790> you<00:02:54.790> can

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
like a spoon but I won't but you can

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.809 
like a spoon but I won't but you can
just<00:02:55.150> dump<00:02:55.390> about<00:02:56.200> right<00:02:57.130> now<00:02:57.280> I'm<00:02:57.579> just

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
just dump about right now I'm just

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:01.440 
just dump about right now I'm just
estimating<00:02:58.410> but<00:02:59.410> I<00:02:59.739> guess<00:03:00.459> you<00:03:00.640> could<00:03:00.819> put<00:03:01.000> two

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
estimating but I guess you could put two

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.289 
estimating but I guess you could put two
spoonfuls<00:03:02.400> two<00:03:03.400> to<00:03:03.519> three<00:03:03.700> spoonfuls<00:03:03.970> in

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
spoonfuls two to three spoonfuls in

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:10.199 
spoonfuls two to three spoonfuls in
there<00:03:08.190> I'm<00:03:09.190> going<00:03:09.310> to<00:03:09.370> put<00:03:09.459> a<00:03:09.549> little<00:03:09.819> bit<00:03:09.970> more

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
there I'm going to put a little bit more

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:16.080 
there I'm going to put a little bit more
because<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:12.340> more<00:03:12.989> you<00:03:13.989> add<00:03:14.170> a<00:03:14.590> can't<00:03:14.920> hurt<00:03:15.220> so

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
because the more you add a can't hurt so

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.319 
because the more you add a can't hurt so
now<00:03:16.480> that<00:03:16.870> you've<00:03:17.230> put<00:03:18.040> your<00:03:18.459> baby<00:03:18.790> powder<00:03:19.060> in

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
now that you've put your baby powder in

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:21.960 
now that you've put your baby powder in
it<00:03:19.600> should<00:03:19.840> just<00:03:20.019> look<00:03:20.170> like<00:03:20.380> this<00:03:20.730> let's<00:03:21.730> cut

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
it should just look like this let's cut

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.720 
it should just look like this let's cut
it<00:03:22.060> up<00:03:22.120> into<00:03:22.480> that<00:03:22.600> I'm<00:03:23.230> making<00:03:23.620> a<00:03:23.769> mess<00:03:24.069> well

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
it up into that I'm making a mess well

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.930 
it up into that I'm making a mess well
then<00:03:25.299> I'm<00:03:25.420> going<00:03:25.630> to<00:03:25.720> put<00:03:26.049> this<00:03:26.799> into<00:03:27.190> the<00:03:27.459> lid

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
then I'm going to put this into the lid

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.080 
then I'm going to put this into the lid
or<00:03:28.690> you<00:03:28.959> can<00:03:29.079> have<00:03:29.260> your<00:03:29.290> sealed<00:03:29.940> nipple<00:03:30.940> and

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
or you can have your sealed nipple and

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.270 
or you can have your sealed nipple and
then<00:03:31.329> you're<00:03:31.510> going<00:03:31.690> to<00:03:31.750> take<00:03:31.930> it<00:03:32.079> and<00:03:32.889> mix<00:03:33.069> the

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
then you're going to take it and mix the

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.220 
then you're going to take it and mix the
nipples<00:03:33.579> seal<00:03:34.389> and<00:03:34.660> you're<00:03:34.780> going<00:03:34.930> to<00:03:35.019> shake

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
nipples seal and you're going to shake

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.449 
nipples seal and you're going to shake
it<00:03:35.260> and<00:03:36.329> then<00:03:37.329> it<00:03:38.200> should<00:03:38.500> turn<00:03:38.799> out<00:03:39.010> to<00:03:39.280> look

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:42.780 
it and then it should turn out to look
in<00:03:39.730> a<00:03:39.910> perfect<00:03:40.500> milk<00:03:41.500> color<00:03:42.040> so<00:03:42.400> I<00:03:42.430> don't<00:03:42.700> know
