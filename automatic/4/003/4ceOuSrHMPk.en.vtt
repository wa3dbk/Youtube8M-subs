skills they've got so so that they run

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.120 
skills they've got so so that they run
down<00:04:22.480> alphabetical<00:04:23.480> order<00:04:23.660> and<00:04:24.130> they're

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
down alphabetical order and they're

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:28.360 
down alphabetical order and they're
alphabetized<00:04:25.340> by<00:04:26.180> game<00:04:26.780> so<00:04:27.260> base<00:04:28.100> game

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
alphabetized by game so base game

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:29.900 
alphabetized by game so base game
expansions<00:04:28.940> in<00:04:29.060> the<00:04:29.150> front

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
expansions in the front

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.670 
expansions in the front
and<00:04:30.120> then<00:04:30.390> when<00:04:30.480> we<00:04:30.570> get<00:04:30.660> down<00:04:30.720> to<00:04:31.140> Wolverine

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
and then when we get down to Wolverine

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.340 
and then when we get down to Wolverine
here<00:04:31.950> at<00:04:32.070> the<00:04:32.160> back<00:04:32.430> from<00:04:32.850> the<00:04:32.910> base<00:04:33.060> game<00:04:33.350> we

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
here at the back from the base game we

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.230 
here at the back from the base game we
move<00:04:34.590> into<00:04:34.770> the<00:04:34.950> new<00:04:35.070> characters<00:04:35.520> advertised

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
move into the new characters advertised

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.230 
move into the new characters advertised
so<00:04:37.080> to<00:04:37.530> divide<00:04:37.800> my<00:04:38.070> new<00:04:38.430> characters<00:04:38.970> obviously

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
so to divide my new characters obviously

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.470 
so to divide my new characters obviously
I<00:04:39.420> didn't<00:04:39.600> have<00:04:39.690> enough<00:04:39.870> cards<00:04:40.200> I<00:04:40.710> used<00:04:41.520> some

I didn't have enough cards I used some

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.090 
I didn't have enough cards I used some
cards<00:04:42.810> some<00:04:42.990> divided<00:04:43.320> cards<00:04:43.500> I<00:04:43.530> had<00:04:43.680> left<00:04:43.890> to

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
cards some divided cards I had left to

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.740 
cards some divided cards I had left to

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
do the rest of the masterminds in the

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.780 
do the rest of the masterminds in the
new<00:04:45.870> villains<00:04:46.230> and<00:04:46.710> henchmen<00:04:47.130> so<00:04:47.610> I've<00:04:47.670> got

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
really I just came up with a new

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.490 
really I just came up with a new
solution<00:04:52.320> completely<00:04:53.160> to<00:04:53.960> divide<00:04:54.960> the<00:04:55.320> new

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
solution completely to divide the new

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.070 
solution completely to divide the new
heroes<00:04:55.890> at<00:04:56.040> least<00:04:56.220> anyway<00:04:56.550> so<00:04:57.360> just<00:04:57.660> to<00:04:57.930> show

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
heroes at least anyway so just to show

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.550 
heroes at least anyway so just to show
you<00:04:58.140> I<00:04:58.650> bought<00:04:59.070> black<00:04:59.280> just<00:04:59.940> some<00:05:00.060> black<00:05:00.210> card

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 
you I bought black just some black card

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:04.010 
you I bought black just some black card
it's<00:05:01.560> um<00:05:01.950> I<00:05:02.210> don't<00:05:03.210> know<00:05:03.300> what<00:05:03.480> weight<00:05:03.750> it<00:05:03.930> is

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
it's um I don't know what weight it is

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.210 
it's um I don't know what weight it is
to<00:05:04.230> be<00:05:04.320> honest<00:05:04.560> I<00:05:04.680> think<00:05:04.740> it's<00:05:04.920> two<00:05:05.130> hundred

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
to be honest I think it's two hundred

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.730 
to be honest I think it's two hundred
and<00:05:05.520> two<00:05:06.480> hundred<00:05:06.510> gram<00:05:06.930> I<00:05:06.960> think<00:05:07.290> it<00:05:07.380> is<00:05:07.500> so

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
and two hundred gram I think it is so

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.190 
and two hundred gram I think it is so
it's<00:05:07.920> it's<00:05:08.100> it's<00:05:08.970> pretty<00:05:09.030> much<00:05:09.330> similar<00:05:09.690> to

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:10.200 
it's it's it's pretty much similar to

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.920 
it's it's it's pretty much similar to
the<00:05:10.490> to<00:05:11.490> the<00:05:11.610> thickness<00:05:11.970> of<00:05:12.120> of<00:05:12.510> the<00:05:12.660> actual

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
the to the thickness of of the actual

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:15.080 
the to the thickness of of the actual
cards<00:05:13.200> you<00:05:13.320> get<00:05:13.560> that<00:05:13.770> a<00:05:13.830> variety<00:05:14.130> cards<00:05:14.460> so

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
cards you get that a variety cards so

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.510 
cards you get that a variety cards so
I've<00:05:15.240> just<00:05:15.270> black<00:05:15.570> black<00:05:16.050> cards<00:05:16.440> I<00:05:16.620> to<00:05:17.220> cut

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
I've just black black cards I to cut

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.980 
I've just black black cards I to cut
them<00:05:17.700> obviously<00:05:17.850> to<00:05:18.210> size<00:05:18.420> they<00:05:18.600> didn't<00:05:18.810> come

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
them obviously to size they didn't come

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.980 
them obviously to size they didn't come
this<00:05:19.140> size<00:05:19.440> so<00:05:20.100> there's<00:05:20.280> bought<00:05:20.430> some<00:05:20.670> I<00:05:20.990> think

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
this size so there's bought some I think

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:23.210 
this size so there's bought some I think
they<00:05:22.050> were<00:05:22.140> wedding<00:05:22.440> invitations<00:05:23.070> or

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:23.220 
they were wedding invitations or

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.360 
they were wedding invitations or
something<00:05:23.490> but<00:05:23.820> but<00:05:24.360> cut<00:05:24.570> them<00:05:24.690> to<00:05:24.810> size<00:05:24.840> and

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
something but but cut them to size and

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:29.150 
something but but cut them to size and
just<00:05:26.370> exactly<00:05:26.610> the<00:05:26.940> same<00:05:27.120> thing<00:05:28.040> got<00:05:29.040> the

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:29.160 
just exactly the same thing got the

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.040 
just exactly the same thing got the
character's<00:05:29.580> name<00:05:29.610> and<00:05:30.390> what<00:05:30.600> faction<00:05:30.960> they

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
character's name and what faction they

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:34.760 
character's name and what faction they
belong<00:05:31.260> to<00:05:31.410> and<00:05:31.710> their<00:05:31.830> skills<00:05:32.250> so<00:05:32.900> that's<00:05:33.900> it

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:34.770 
belong to and their skills so that's it

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:36.620 
belong to and their skills so that's it
basically<00:05:35.070> that's<00:05:35.640> my<00:05:35.790> storage<00:05:36.120> solution<00:05:36.600> for

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630 
basically that's my storage solution for

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:40.810 
basically that's my storage solution for
legendary<00:05:37.320> with<00:05:38.010> dark<00:05:38.310> city<00:05:38.640> included<00:05:39.240> I

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:40.820 
legendary with dark city included I

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.740 
legendary with dark city included I
think<00:05:41.820> that<00:05:41.910> it<00:05:42.000> all<00:05:42.120> still<00:05:42.390> fit<00:05:42.600> if<00:05:42.720> you

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
think that it all still fit if you

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.210 
think that it all still fit if you
sleeve<00:05:43.080> the<00:05:43.200> cards<00:05:43.530> if<00:05:43.650> you<00:05:43.740> use<00:05:43.890> the<00:05:44.010> thin

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.220 
sleeve the cards if you use the thin

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:45.770 
sleeve the cards if you use the thin
sleeves<00:05:44.520> but<00:05:45.300> then<00:05:45.420> you're<00:05:45.510> going<00:05:45.600> to<00:05:45.660> be

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780 
sleeves but then you're going to be

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:47.140 
sleeves but then you're going to be
struggling<00:05:46.050> I<00:05:46.260> think<00:05:46.530> when<00:05:46.680> the<00:05:46.770> new

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150 
struggling I think when the new

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:52.400 
struggling I think when the new
expansions<00:05:48.150> come<00:05:48.420> out<00:05:48.570> so<00:05:48.900> hence<00:05:49.890> why<00:05:51.290> I'll<00:05:52.290> be

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:52.410 
expansions come out so hence why I'll be

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.500
