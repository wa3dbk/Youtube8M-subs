00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.749 
everybody in this video we're going into
a<00:00:03.270> compression<00:00:03.780> test<00:00:04.080> on<00:00:04.230> the<00:00:04.350> players<00:00:04.759> PwC

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
a compression test on the players PwC

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.089 
a compression test on the players PwC
hopefully<00:00:06.660> it's<00:00:06.810> supposed<00:00:07.259> to<00:00:07.350> maybe<00:00:07.830> rain

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
and now I'm gonna do a compression test

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.760 
and now I'm gonna do a compression test
in<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:14.880> engine<00:00:15.179> just<00:00:15.360> make<00:00:16.139> sure<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.350> cell<00:00:16.590> is

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
in the engine just make sure the cell is

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.620 
in the engine just make sure the cell is
fine<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:17.490> I'm<00:00:17.820> just<00:00:18.029> running<00:00:18.210> for<00:00:18.420> a<00:00:18.480> few

work notice my last video first starting
off<00:00:37.970> with<00:00:38.059> the<00:00:38.180> season<00:00:38.510> around<00:00:38.750> a<00:00:38.780> little<00:00:38.960> bit

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.079 
off with the season around a little bit

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:40.900 
off with the season around a little bit
rough<00:00:39.260> you<00:00:39.410> gotta<00:00:39.590> notice<00:00:39.860> now<00:00:40.040> it's<00:00:40.790> gonna

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
rough you gotta notice now it's gonna

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.880 
rough you gotta notice now it's gonna
start<00:00:41.239> off<00:00:41.390> it's<00:00:41.570> gonna<00:00:41.690> run<00:00:41.930> a<00:00:42.140> lot<00:00:42.379> smoother

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
start off it's gonna run a lot smoother

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.479 
start off it's gonna run a lot smoother
than<00:00:42.920> in<00:00:43.190> the<00:00:43.309> video<00:00:43.610> where<00:00:43.940> I<00:00:43.970> changed<00:00:44.300> oil

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:45.489 
than in the video where I changed oil

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:47.770 
than in the video where I changed oil
usually<00:00:46.489> after<00:00:46.610> wintertime<00:00:47.089> engines<00:00:47.660> are

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
usually after wintertime engines are

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:48.939 
usually after wintertime engines are
little<00:00:47.989> crank<00:00:48.170> and<00:00:48.290> you<00:00:48.379> first<00:00:48.559> start<00:00:48.769> them<00:00:48.860> up

00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:48.949 
little crank and you first start them up

00:00:48.949 --> 00:01:00.350 
little crank and you first start them up
but<00:00:49.070> just<00:00:49.220> listen<00:00:49.460> to<00:00:49.550> this<00:00:49.640> now

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.580 

just<00:01:01.360> like<00:01:01.510> it<00:01:01.629> seemed<00:01:01.809> I<00:01:01.930> set<00:01:02.170> up<00:01:02.199> this<00:01:02.379> from

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
just like it seemed I set up this from

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.619 
just like it seemed I set up this from
my<00:01:02.710> garden<00:01:03.129> hose<00:01:03.280> attaches<00:01:03.730> I<00:01:03.969> just<00:01:04.150> cut<00:01:04.449> the

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
my garden hose attaches I just cut the

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.830 
my garden hose attaches I just cut the
hose<00:01:04.780> Peter<00:01:05.650> off<00:01:05.890> then<00:01:06.790> on<00:01:06.909> the<00:01:07.030> box<00:01:07.240> side<00:01:07.510> you

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
hose Peter off then on the box side you

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.680 
hose Peter off then on the box side you
can<00:01:07.990> see<00:01:08.020> I<00:01:08.500> got<00:01:09.130> a<00:01:09.159> clap<00:01:09.490> clapping<00:01:10.270> off<00:01:10.540> the

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 
can see I got a clap clapping off the

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.780 
can see I got a clap clapping off the
suction<00:01:11.080> so<00:01:11.229> the<00:01:11.350> water<00:01:11.560> is<00:01:12.220> forced<00:01:12.580> through

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 
suction so the water is forced through

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.310 
suction so the water is forced through
the<00:01:12.850> engine<00:01:13.180> so<00:01:13.390> coming<00:01:13.690> out<00:01:13.750> the<00:01:13.900> back<00:01:14.049> that

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
the engine so coming out the back that

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.100 
the engine so coming out the back that
way<00:01:14.440> I<00:01:14.470> don't<00:01:15.180> have<00:01:16.180> issues<00:01:16.300> with<00:01:16.630> it<00:01:16.780> possibly

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
way I don't have issues with it possibly

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.510 
way I don't have issues with it possibly
overheating<00:01:17.950> when<00:01:18.070> I<00:01:18.100> want<00:01:18.340> to<00:01:18.399> run<00:01:18.520> it<00:01:20.430> so<00:01:21.430> in

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
overheating when I want to run it so in

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.100 
overheating when I want to run it so in
this<00:01:21.610> particular<00:01:21.850> model<00:01:22.390> in<00:01:22.690> the<00:01:22.780> pleural

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
this particular model in the pleural

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.039 
this particular model in the pleural
abrasion<00:01:23.710> for<00:01:24.490> the<00:01:24.759> compression<00:01:25.690> test<00:01:25.720> you

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049 
abrasion for the compression test you

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:28.649 
abrasion for the compression test you
want<00:01:26.170> to<00:01:26.259> remove<00:01:26.530> your<00:01:27.000> power<00:01:28.000> wires<00:01:28.240> from<00:01:28.509> the

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
want to remove your power wires from the

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:30.180 
want to remove your power wires from the
coils<00:01:29.080> because<00:01:29.259> your<00:01:29.380> coils<00:01:29.710> over<00:01:29.890> top<00:01:30.100> of

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
coils because your coils over top of

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.469 
coils because your coils over top of
your<00:01:30.280> spark<00:01:30.490> plug<00:01:30.729> so<00:01:30.880> then<00:01:31.000> you<00:01:31.090> want<00:01:31.270> to<00:01:31.360> grab

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
your spark plug so then you want to grab

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:33.840 
your spark plug so then you want to grab
and<00:01:31.810> remove<00:01:32.020> the<00:01:32.110> cold<00:01:32.350> packs<00:01:32.590> and<00:01:33.310> get<00:01:33.490> access

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
and remove the cold packs and get access

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.510 
and remove the cold packs and get access
to<00:01:33.880> the<00:01:34.090> spark<00:01:34.330> plugs<00:01:34.600> underneath<00:01:35.259> as<00:01:36.190> you<00:01:36.399> can

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
to the spark plugs underneath as you can

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.490 
to the spark plugs underneath as you can
clearly<00:01:36.729> see<00:01:37.000> the<00:01:37.450> spark<00:01:37.840> plug<00:01:38.020> boots<00:01:38.320> are

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
clearly see the spark plug boots are

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.290 
clearly see the spark plug boots are
removed<00:01:38.830> and<00:01:39.490> I<00:01:39.640> switch<00:01:39.850> to<00:01:40.000> a<00:01:40.030> different

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
removed and I switch to a different

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.669 
removed and I switch to a different
camera<00:01:40.479> just<00:01:40.720> to<00:01:40.840> show<00:01:41.050> you<00:01:41.110> a<00:01:41.259> little<00:01:41.530> bit<00:01:41.649> of

00:01:41.669 --> 00:01:41.679 
camera just to show you a little bit of

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:43.139 
camera just to show you a little bit of
close-up<00:01:42.220> view<00:01:42.399> so<00:01:42.460> you<00:01:42.610> can<00:01:42.700> understand

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:43.149 
close-up view so you can understand

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:46.950 
close-up view so you can understand
what's<00:01:43.300> going<00:01:43.539> on<00:01:43.659> so<00:01:45.270> this<00:01:46.270> camera<00:01:46.630> I'm<00:01:46.780> going

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
what's going on so this camera I'm going

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.719 
what's going on so this camera I'm going
to<00:01:47.020> show<00:01:47.259> you<00:01:47.319> the<00:01:47.530> spark<00:01:47.830> plugs<00:01:48.100> on<00:01:48.670> the

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
to show you the spark plugs on the

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:51.359 
to show you the spark plugs on the
players<00:01:49.690> Liberty<00:01:50.110> engine<00:01:50.470> is<00:01:50.619> quite<00:01:51.039> far<00:01:51.340> down

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
players Liberty engine is quite far down

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:54.120 
players Liberty engine is quite far down
as<00:01:51.850> you<00:01:51.909> can<00:01:52.030> see<00:01:52.360> so<00:01:52.690> when<00:01:53.470> I<00:01:53.500> grab<00:01:53.740> a<00:01:53.770> spark
