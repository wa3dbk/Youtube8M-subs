it's<00:00:30.449> not<00:00:30.570> too<00:00:30.720> bad<00:00:30.929> I'm<00:00:31.170> think<00:00:31.439> I'm<00:00:31.500> on<00:00:31.650> pace

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
it's not too bad I'm think I'm on pace

it's not too bad I'm think I'm on pace
are<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.640> little<00:00:32.790> bit<00:00:32.969> slower<00:00:33.210> actually<00:00:33.600> than<00:00:33.719> I

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
are a little bit slower actually than I

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.060 
are a little bit slower actually than I
was<00:00:33.930> with<00:00:34.079> modern<00:00:34.290> warfare<00:00:34.440> 2<00:00:34.680> I<00:00:34.710> kind<00:00:35.040> of

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
was with modern warfare 2 I kind of

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.510 
was with modern warfare 2 I kind of
played<00:00:35.219> that<00:00:35.520> that<00:00:35.820> game<00:00:36.059> so<00:00:36.360> much<00:00:36.540> more<00:00:37.520> but

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
played that that game so much more but

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.590 
played that that game so much more but
that's<00:00:38.790> because<00:00:39.000> I<00:00:39.149> had<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.300> little<00:00:39.390> bit<00:00:39.540> more

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
that's because I had a little bit more

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.470 
that's because I had a little bit more
free<00:00:39.809> time<00:00:39.960> back<00:00:40.200> then<00:00:40.379> but<00:00:40.590> now<00:00:41.239> win-loss<00:00:42.239> is

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:35.789 
got my my rushing rushing SMD class this

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:38.390 
got my my rushing rushing SMD class this
is<00:04:35.910> pretty<00:04:36.090> fun<00:04:36.300> to<00:04:36.449> use<00:04:36.539> the<00:04:36.600> PM<00:04:36.900> 63<00:04:37.500> got<00:04:38.250> the

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
is pretty fun to use the PM 63 got the

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.830 
is pretty fun to use the PM 63 got the
scavenger<00:04:38.789> pro<00:04:39.000> it's<00:04:39.180> a<00:04:39.240> must<00:04:39.479> for<00:04:39.690> this

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
scavenger pro it's a must for this

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.279 
scavenger pro it's a must for this
because<00:04:40.260> the<00:04:40.590> PM<00:04:40.860> 63<00:04:41.400> as<00:04:41.550> you<00:04:41.669> can<00:04:41.820> see<00:04:42.139> it<00:04:43.139> has

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:43.289 
because the PM 63 as you can see it has

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:45.680 
because the PM 63 as you can see it has
with<00:04:44.130> extended<00:04:44.550> mags<00:04:44.580> that's<00:04:44.850> got<00:04:45.000> 30<00:04:45.210> rounds

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
with extended mags that's got 30 rounds

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.750 
with extended mags that's got 30 rounds
and<00:04:45.810> then<00:04:45.900> it<00:04:46.020> only<00:04:46.080> has<00:04:46.320> 60<00:04:46.770> so<00:04:47.400> you<00:04:47.520> only<00:04:47.610> got

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 
and then it only has 60 so you only got

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.839 
and then it only has 60 so you only got
three<00:04:48.000> clips<00:04:48.320> total<00:04:49.320> in<00:04:49.470> the<00:04:49.530> the<00:04:50.430> hole<00:04:50.610> and

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:50.849 
three clips total in the the hole and

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:53.360 
three clips total in the the hole and
the<00:04:51.750> hole<00:04:51.810> starting<00:04:52.260> gun<00:04:52.440> without<00:04:52.770> scavenger

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
the hole starting gun without scavenger

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.689 
the hole starting gun without scavenger
pro<00:04:53.550> so<00:04:54.530> there's<00:04:55.530> just<00:04:55.680> another<00:04:55.860> variation<00:04:56.250> of

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:56.699 
pro so there's just another variation of

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:59.750 
pro so there's just another variation of
this<00:04:57.050> 47<00:04:58.050> class<00:04:58.289> but<00:04:58.680> I<00:04:58.710> have<00:04:58.979> the<00:04:59.250> marathon

00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760 
this 47 class but I have the marathon

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.700 
this 47 class but I have the marathon
perked<00:05:00.030> instead<00:05:00.570> of<00:05:00.690> ninja<00:05:01.169> so<00:05:01.410> this<00:05:01.560> is<00:05:01.590> my

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
perked instead of ninja so this is my

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.310 
perked instead of ninja so this is my
rushing<00:05:02.240> domination<00:05:03.240> go<00:05:03.419> to<00:05:03.479> be<00:05:03.660> go<00:05:04.050> gate<00:05:04.199> b

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
rushing domination go to be go gate b

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.409 
rushing domination go to be go gate b
class<00:05:04.590> we<00:05:05.430> got<00:05:05.550> the<00:05:05.639> world's<00:05:05.880> weapons<00:05:06.180> class
