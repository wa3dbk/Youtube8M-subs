00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.810
 and we come back with more 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.780
 abc rural 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.390
 how good it is to be able to choose the type of 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.210
 meat that one wants to consume 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:17.220
 and we're looking for lean meat meat with 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.830
 Fat without fat meat but there is a 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.690
 characteristic that makes a cattle 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.210
 special with wayúu that the Japanese 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.939
 they consider very important is the most 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.790
 thrashed that is the veined the fat 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.410
 within the flesh and that they do 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.900
 special a cattle that we are going to 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.380
 consider now why is it you 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:41.300
 the producer and turn well do not talk about 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.300
 the characteristics of canaguá yo 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.900
 the 'guaje' is a breed of cattle 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.180
 Japanese origin characterized by its 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.760
 Marbled meat with a large percentage of 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.949
 unsaturated fats of the oleaginous type 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.140
 between the fibers which gives it a flavor 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.350
 different and healthy in our country 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.360
 this race was introduced in the year 1999 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.340
 when the first ones were brought 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.410
 genetic materials which were 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.080
 used in the insemination of cows 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.510
 braman and brangus and the first calves 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.479
 Paraguayan wayú were born in the year 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.670
 2000 since 2003 the gentleman there turn 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.500
 there if he takes the post initiated by the 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.810
 omori company that withdrew from 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.420
 Paraguay and continue the journey towards 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.930
 what is the development of copies of 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:40.850
 this guaya race there are four variety two 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:45.710
 black and two red but 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:48.350
 now in japan same 95% cool a black 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.650
 no more red 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:56.380
 uses very little symbolic of region not 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:02:00.320
 more because there are characteristics of red 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:02.130
 less marbled and a little bit of difference 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.450
 from there 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:08.250
 quality of meat Mr. Hayashi 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.500
 He explained that thanks to the crossing with 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.630
 specimens of the Brangus breed have 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.940
 achieved animals with excellent 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.010
 adaptation and above all things 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.170
 that perfectly inherit the 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.930
 characteristics of marbled meat 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.870
 what is special about this race 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.810
 however a difference that exists 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.930
 between the 'guaje' and other races is the 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.670
 expensive food on which we 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.580
 the breeder speaks that practically 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.849
 performs the complete cycle from breeding 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:41.220
 until the commercialization in addition to 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:44.549
 other special features that 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:48.120
 has this breed and feeding base of 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:51.420
 feeding corn and soybeans 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:54.380
 wheat and then and the feat and I'm 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:58.830
 using the but 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:01.440
 really very expensive feeding by 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:05.280
 that the price also different with another 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:09.240
 another breed per day average one kilo per 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:14.250
 day but there is a moment a month that 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:18.630
 colder one kilo 200 grams per day rises 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:22.140
 but average one kilo more less this the 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:27.090
 asa does not walk and only to eat and 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:30.720
 sleep and that's why per head pretty much 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:34.890
 78 square meter per head under roof 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:37.590
 so ideal per head between cuts 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:40.350
 more appreciated by the public but that 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.720
 they are the most expensive according to 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:46.200
 our interviewee are the 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:48.510
 steak ancho the narrow steak the tenderloin and 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.000
 cuadril cover himself told us 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:54.660
 how much does a kilogram of meat cost? 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.890
 guayo and why is it so expensive 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:03.800
 in last sale what 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:06.760
 We did as a tenderloin 220,000 see and 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:11.200
 kilo in extreme and 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:15.159
 the cost of feeding much more expensive 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:18.250
 that another or common animal that's why it takes a 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:21.250
 inexpensive and expensive the price of meat 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:23.590
 to learn more about wagyu meat and 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:26.889
 its level of marble eo in relation to 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:29.169
 other meats Lord Hayashi showed us 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:31.229
 the difference in a measurement table 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:34.919
 Now I want to show the number of 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:37.919
 marbles of guayo meat on board 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:37.919
 Japan 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:47.340
 this 1 to 12 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:52.440
 usually this way of Paraguayan meat and 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:57.060
 this and two or three but with my 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:59.480
 experience with f1 or brahms with baggio 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:06.240
 come up 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:10.979
 this level and with a ball or pure guayo 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:14.270
 this and until here comes this already too 

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:17.900
 thank you very much I think that 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:22.280
 difficult to reach up here but in Japan 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:25.940
 There is this kind of meat I want to use 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:30.210
 300 hours 400 hours to meat color 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:35.419
 be darker and normally 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:35.419
 in meat of Paraguay this cross 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:44.750
 Saleh but under cover but grab surf 

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:50.660
 lighter flesh meat color comes out 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:54.440
 and this whiter fat better with meat 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:59.990
 or here but it depends on power if 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:06:02.180
 eat a lot of green grass and corn leaves a 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:08.070
 little bit more 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:11.280
 yellow then from my production of 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:16.220
 businessman in the middle and also meat 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:16.220
 of curro also in the middle
