little bit about the brown tide sure

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:29.800 
little bit about the brown tide sure
well<00:00:28.460> it's<00:00:28.669> a<00:00:28.789> microalgae<00:00:29.390> or<00:00:29.779> a

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
well it's a microalgae or a

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.920 
well it's a microalgae or a
phytoplankton<00:00:30.289> and<00:00:30.949> this<00:00:31.819> year<00:00:32.300> it's<00:00:32.570> grown

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:32.930 
phytoplankton and this year it's grown

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.009 
phytoplankton and this year it's grown
very<00:00:33.440> intense<00:00:33.920> starting<00:00:34.430> in<00:00:34.520> April<00:00:35.019> spreading

00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:36.019 
very intense starting in April spreading

month of May and as you can see it's
still<00:00:39.079> a<00:00:39.350> big<00:00:39.710> problem<00:00:39.890> here<00:00:40.460> in<00:00:40.550> June<00:00:41.109> the

00:00:42.099 --> 00:00:42.109 
still a big problem here in June the

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:44.290 
still a big problem here in June the
brown<00:00:42.829> tide<00:00:43.100> is<00:00:43.309> toxic<00:00:43.640> to<00:00:44.000> a<00:00:44.059> lot<00:00:44.210> of

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
brown tide is toxic to a lot of

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.169 
brown tide is toxic to a lot of
shellfish<00:00:44.780> I<00:00:45.050> can<00:00:45.590> kill<00:00:45.829> off<00:00:45.980> scallops<00:00:46.579> we

00:00:47.169 --> 00:00:47.179 
shellfish I can kill off scallops we

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:48.610 
shellfish I can kill off scallops we
also<00:00:47.359> know<00:00:47.539> it's<00:00:47.690> very<00:00:47.870> harmful<00:00:48.199> to<00:00:48.410> hard

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
also know it's very harmful to hard

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.889 
also know it's very harmful to hard
clams<00:00:48.949> and<00:00:49.820> probably<00:00:50.269> is<00:00:50.329> responsible<00:00:50.870> for

00:00:50.889 --> 00:00:50.899 
clams and probably is responsible for

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:52.389 
clams and probably is responsible for
some<00:00:51.170> of<00:00:51.199> the<00:00:51.260> loss<00:00:51.469> so<00:00:51.649> hard<00:00:51.859> clams<00:00:52.070> in<00:00:52.219> great

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
some of the loss so hard clams in great

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:54.189 
some of the loss so hard clams in great
South<00:00:52.609> Bay<00:00:52.850> and<00:00:53.059> you<00:00:53.149> can<00:00:53.629> see<00:00:53.780> what<00:00:53.960> the<00:00:54.050> water

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
South Bay and you can see what the water

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:56.619 
South Bay and you can see what the water
is<00:00:54.410> dark<00:00:54.679> as<00:00:54.859> it<00:00:55.010> is<00:00:55.160> it<00:00:55.579> clouds<00:00:55.969> the<00:00:56.239> bottom

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
is dark as it is it clouds the bottom

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:58.389 
is dark as it is it clouds the bottom
and<00:00:56.780> it<00:00:56.839> kills<00:00:57.350> off<00:00:57.530> any<00:00:57.739> plants<00:00:58.129> that<00:00:58.160> might

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
and it kills off any plants that might

00:00:58.399 --> 00:00:59.739 
and it kills off any plants that might
grow<00:00:58.579> on<00:00:58.670> the<00:00:58.760> bottom<00:00:59.030> of<00:00:59.059> the<00:00:59.149> bays<00:00:59.300> like<00:00:59.539> eel

00:00:59.739 --> 00:00:59.749 
grow on the bottom of the bays like eel

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:01.540 
grow on the bottom of the bays like eel
grass<00:00:59.899> what<00:01:00.499> are<00:01:00.620> the<00:01:00.710> factors<00:01:01.190> do<00:01:01.309> you<00:01:01.399> think

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
grass what are the factors do you think

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.130 
grass what are the factors do you think
that<00:01:01.699> brought<00:01:01.909> it<00:01:02.089> about<00:01:02.300> this<00:01:02.600> year<00:01:02.780> since<00:01:02.989> we

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
that brought it about this year since we

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.530 
that brought it about this year since we
had<00:01:03.409> been<00:01:03.440> since<00:01:04.010> the<00:01:04.100> year<00:01:04.250> 2000<00:01:04.879> before<00:01:05.239> we'd

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
had been since the year 2000 before we'd

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.870 
had been since the year 2000 before we'd
had<00:01:05.720> it<00:01:05.900> again<00:01:06.110> well<00:01:06.830> we<00:01:07.190> know<00:01:07.340> that<00:01:07.370> the<00:01:07.670> month

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
had it again well we know that the month

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.840 
had it again well we know that the month
of<00:01:08.030> April<00:01:08.510> was<00:01:09.050> a<00:01:09.080> lot<00:01:09.440> warmer<00:01:09.920> than<00:01:10.130> usual<00:01:10.460> and

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
of April was a lot warmer than usual and

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.250 
of April was a lot warmer than usual and
we<00:01:10.910> had<00:01:11.030> about<00:01:11.090> a<00:01:11.210> three<00:01:11.510> week<00:01:11.690> period<00:01:11.960> without

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
we had about a three week period without

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.730 
we had about a three week period without
any<00:01:12.650> rain<00:01:12.860> just<00:01:13.580> sunny<00:01:13.910> and<00:01:14.240> clear<00:01:15.050> and<00:01:15.530> we

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
any rain just sunny and clear and we

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:16.870 
any rain just sunny and clear and we
think<00:01:15.950> that<00:01:16.040> was<00:01:16.130> probably<00:01:16.250> an<00:01:16.460> important

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
think that was probably an important

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.700 
think that was probably an important
factor<00:01:17.270> in<00:01:17.330> the<00:01:17.420> blooms<00:01:17.660> starting<00:01:18.170> there<00:01:18.380> and

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
factor in the blooms starting there and

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.430 
factor in the blooms starting there and
once<00:01:19.160> the<00:01:19.370> brown<00:01:19.640> tide<00:01:19.880> takes<00:01:20.240> off<00:01:20.510> there's

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:21.440 
once the brown tide takes off there's

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.080 
once the brown tide takes off there's
not<00:01:21.590> a<00:01:21.620> lot<00:01:21.890> that<00:01:21.920> can<00:01:22.190> stop<00:01:22.490> it<00:01:22.520> except<00:01:23.060> for

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
not a lot that can stop it except for

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.640 
not a lot that can stop it except for
very<00:01:23.300> high<00:01:23.540> temperatures<00:01:24.110> and<00:01:24.470> what

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
very high temperatures and what

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.410 
very high temperatures and what
temperature<00:01:25.130> starts<00:01:25.640> to<00:01:25.730> kick<00:01:26.030> the<00:01:26.210> brown

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
temperature starts to kick the brown

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.810 
temperature starts to kick the brown
tide<00:01:26.660> back<00:01:26.870> down<00:01:27.170> well<00:01:27.710> usually<00:01:28.130> when<00:01:28.520> the<00:01:28.640> bay

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
tide back down well usually when the bay

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.350 
tide back down well usually when the bay
hits<00:01:29.180> the<00:01:29.390> high<00:01:29.600> 70s<00:01:30.290> low<00:01:30.860> 80s<00:01:30.890> or<00:01:31.460> so<00:01:31.700> that's

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
hits the high 70s low 80s or so that's

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.730 
hits the high 70s low 80s or so that's
when<00:01:32.630> you<00:01:32.720> start<00:01:32.990> seeing<00:01:33.170> the<00:01:33.260> brown<00:01:33.470> tide

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
when you start seeing the brown tide

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.700 
when you start seeing the brown tide
going<00:01:34.070> away<00:01:34.340> it's<00:01:34.970> the<00:01:35.090> brown<00:01:35.330> tide<00:01:35.710> dangerous

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
going away it's the brown tide dangerous

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.910 
going away it's the brown tide dangerous
to<00:01:36.950> fin<00:01:37.220> fish<00:01:37.460> at<00:01:37.670> all<00:01:38.080> we<00:01:39.080> don't<00:01:39.290> think<00:01:39.560> so

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
to fin fish at all we don't think so

take<00:03:20.810> for<00:03:20.990> the<00:03:21.230> brown<00:03:21.440> tide<00:03:21.680> to<00:03:21.830> clear<00:03:22.070> up<00:03:22.250> the

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
take for the brown tide to clear up the

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.270 
take for the brown tide to clear up the
summer<00:03:22.870> usually<00:03:23.870> it's<00:03:24.020> the<00:03:24.080> high<00:03:24.380> peak<00:03:24.890> summer

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
summer usually it's the high peak summer

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.580 
summer usually it's the high peak summer
temperature<00:03:25.850> so<00:03:26.150> I'm<00:03:26.750> hoping<00:03:27.410> and

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
temperature so I'm hoping and

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.920 
temperature so I'm hoping and
anticipating<00:03:28.310> that<00:03:28.340> once<00:03:28.760> we<00:03:28.940> hit<00:03:29.090> July<00:03:29.510> and

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
anticipating that once we hit July and

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.660 
anticipating that once we hit July and
into<00:03:30.440> August<00:03:30.590> the<00:03:31.010> bay<00:03:31.160> is<00:03:31.280> gonna<00:03:31.430> heat<00:03:31.640> up

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
into August the bay is gonna heat up

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.670 
into August the bay is gonna heat up
enough<00:03:32.090> and<00:03:32.270> the<00:03:32.360> brown<00:03:32.930> tide<00:03:33.170> can't<00:03:33.470> hack

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
enough and the brown tide can't hack

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.370 
enough and the brown tide can't hack
that<00:03:33.890> and<00:03:34.160> it'll<00:03:34.370> start<00:03:34.580> to<00:03:34.730> die<00:03:34.910> off<00:03:35.380> waiting

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
that and it'll start to die off waiting

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.740 
that and it'll start to die off waiting
for<00:03:36.530> the<00:03:36.650> brown<00:03:36.890> tide<00:03:37.160> to<00:03:37.370> fade<00:03:37.610> and<00:03:37.940> the<00:03:38.450> clean

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750
