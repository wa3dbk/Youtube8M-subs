00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.510

 My father had the books, my father . 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.079
 journalist and one day I did not see some 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.570
 videos dropped on the floor I caught as soon as 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:08.250
 I took the business and sausage and went to read 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:10.170
 at the beginning of the day the title of tomorrow 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.640
 application people and I have re-recorded everything 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.280
 viriato belt

 suddenly picked up the book of adaptation and 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:22.220
 Jirau, anyway, who is today at the time I 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.220
 I noticed drugs and there is a baby style 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:40.110
 is a very carioca author if excited that 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:42.240
 one of the three Cariocas authors is already the mother of 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.000
 Even Antonia was the first 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.610
 mashai so he will not the sight of him gives 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.540
 not only in literary fact but in fact of the 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:54.870
 Life is too mine is a book is a acacho 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:58.200
 more or less as if 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:00.030
 talking was cleaning was done by him and 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.920
 published in issues 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.810
 It is amazing because he writes 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.150
 different income brackets 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.780
 I wrote at home the other that I 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.780
 I write today 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:25.770
 just said 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.260
 the greatest female character in the 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:31.980
 Brazilian literature would be the capture 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:34.800
 but I prefer a whining clinic of 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.290
 gun made of silivri in my understanding is 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.360
 the portrait of perfect male woman in the 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.819
 erotic theme but the theme to split 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.300
 human personality has a character the 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:48.180
 godfather da silva I said it's me too 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.910
 I use this figure of the priest the Bayern 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.170
 barber and I liked the boy and I decided 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.970
 adopt the boy 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:57.299
 are two different characters and have 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.319
 one thing perfectly cariocas are 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:02.010
 women 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:07.069
 the language it them the attitudes 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:07.069
 vergonhice always without it everything is okay 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.130
 I think this is the one everyone agrees is the 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.650
 classic of Brazilian literature 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:30.380
 But for me, for me, home, and for this. 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.600
 prohibited not really mirror 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.340
 literature as the book is back and 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:38.410
 half I am obliged to came to think 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.410
 in it because it is that of a golden book
