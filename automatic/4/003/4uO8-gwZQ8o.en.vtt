00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.320 
that would be very scary for pancake and
he's<00:02:50.710> got<00:02:50.950> nowhere<00:02:51.250> to<00:02:51.490> escape<00:02:51.520> he's<00:02:52.090> got<00:02:52.240> this

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
he's got nowhere to escape he's got this

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.450 
he's got nowhere to escape he's got this
scooter<00:02:52.630> chasing<00:02:53.080> him<00:02:53.230> and<00:02:53.470> and<00:02:53.770> what<00:02:54.190> can<00:02:54.370> he

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:54.460 
scooter chasing him and and what can he

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.100 
scooter chasing him and and what can he
do<00:02:54.640> so<00:02:54.940> I<00:02:55.150> think<00:02:55.210> we<00:02:55.420> need<00:02:55.570> to<00:02:55.660> start<00:02:55.900> setting

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
do so I think we need to start setting

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.130 
do so I think we need to start setting
some<00:02:56.260> rules<00:02:56.620> for<00:02:57.040> the<00:02:57.550> kids<00:02:57.820> now<00:02:58.150> I<00:02:58.480> think<00:02:58.720> then

00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
some rules for the kids now I think then

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.260 
some rules for the kids now I think then
who<00:02:59.830> might<00:03:00.010> be<00:03:00.160> hard<00:03:00.340> to<00:03:00.400> teach<00:03:00.670> you<00:03:00.790> many<00:03:00.970> rows

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
who might be hard to teach you many rows

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.030 
who might be hard to teach you many rows
but<00:03:01.600> if<00:03:01.780> we<00:03:01.930> teach<00:03:02.140> you<00:03:02.260> from<00:03:02.410> this<00:03:02.560> age<00:03:02.740> now

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
but if we teach you from this age now

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.100 
but if we teach you from this age now
that<00:03:03.460> he<00:03:03.520> has<00:03:03.670> to<00:03:03.820> really<00:03:04.240> respect<00:03:04.600> pancake

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
that he has to really respect pancake

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.630 
that he has to really respect pancake
that<00:03:05.230> he<00:03:05.320> has<00:03:05.410> to<00:03:05.560> sit<00:03:05.800> on<00:03:05.950> the<00:03:06.070> ground<00:03:06.310> he<00:03:06.520> can

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
that he has to sit on the ground he can

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.760 
that he has to sit on the ground he can
only<00:03:06.880> Pat<00:03:07.209> pancake<00:03:07.630> he<00:03:07.750> can't<00:03:07.989> pick<00:03:08.230> him<00:03:08.380> up<00:03:08.500> if
