00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.680 
you open the clip and they make sort of
like<00:03:14.560> a<00:03:14.680> snap<00:03:15.040> sound<00:03:15.430> and<00:03:15.730> then<00:03:16.180> you<00:03:16.209> slide

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
like a snap sound and then you slide

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.020 
like a snap sound and then you slide
them<00:03:16.989> onto<00:03:17.440> the<00:03:17.920> sectioned<00:03:18.340> hair<00:03:18.519> and<00:03:18.760> close

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
them onto the sectioned hair and close

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.120 
them onto the sectioned hair and close
the<00:03:19.269> clip<00:03:19.510> and<00:03:19.750> then<00:03:20.709> it<00:03:20.860> should<00:03:21.010> look

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
the clip and then it should look

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:22.979 
the clip and then it should look
something<00:03:21.190> like<00:03:21.610> this<00:03:21.910> it's<00:03:22.690> very

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
something like this it's very

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.360 
something like this it's very
straightforward<00:03:23.320> I<00:03:25.769> actually<00:03:26.769> like<00:03:27.100> to<00:03:27.130> give

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
straightforward I actually like to give

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:28.740 
straightforward I actually like to give
the<00:03:27.519> weft<00:03:27.700> a<00:03:27.820> little<00:03:28.030> tug<00:03:28.239> just<00:03:28.480> to<00:03:28.570> make<00:03:28.720> sure

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
the weft a little tug just to make sure

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.520 
the weft a little tug just to make sure
it's<00:03:29.049> all<00:03:29.170> secure<00:03:30.900> then<00:03:31.900> it<00:03:32.019> is<00:03:32.110> just<00:03:32.320> a<00:03:32.380> case

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
it's all secure then it is just a case

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:34.170 
it's all secure then it is just a case
of<00:03:32.590> repeating<00:03:33.130> these<00:03:33.250> steps<00:03:33.310> until<00:03:33.790> your<00:03:34.030> hair

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
of repeating these steps until your hair

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.420 
of repeating these steps until your hair
is<00:03:34.269> complete<00:03:34.630> all<00:03:35.410> you<00:03:35.709> have<00:03:35.860> to<00:03:35.980> do<00:03:36.070> is<00:03:36.190> place

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
is complete all you have to do is place

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.580 
is complete all you have to do is place
the<00:03:36.610> clips<00:03:36.820> where<00:03:37.060> they<00:03:37.180> fit<00:03:37.420> best<00:03:37.720> and<00:03:38.110> the

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
the clips where they fit best and the

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.449 
the clips where they fit best and the
weft<00:03:40.290> the<00:03:41.290> west's<00:03:41.680> with<00:03:41.830> the<00:03:41.950> most<00:03:42.190> clips

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
weft the west's with the most clips

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.550 
weft the west's with the most clips
should<00:03:42.640> go<00:03:42.820> in<00:03:43.090> a<00:03:43.540> central<00:03:44.019> section<00:03:44.350> of<00:03:44.410> your

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
should go in a central section of your

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.960 
should go in a central section of your
head<00:03:44.739> obviously<00:03:44.920> if<00:03:45.310> that<00:03:45.340> makes<00:03:45.610> sense

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
head obviously if that makes sense

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.240 
head obviously if that makes sense
I<00:03:46.239> usually<00:03:46.780> place<00:03:47.140> three<00:03:47.530> widths<00:03:47.890> at<00:03:47.980> the<00:03:48.070> back

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
I usually place three widths at the back

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.190 
I usually place three widths at the back
and<00:03:48.459> the<00:03:48.640> rest<00:03:48.820> I<00:03:49.000> sort<00:03:49.209> of<00:03:49.269> have<00:03:49.450> curving

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
and the rest I sort of have curving

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.020 
and the rest I sort of have curving
around<00:03:50.500> the<00:03:50.680> side<00:03:50.890> of<00:03:50.920> my<00:03:51.130> head<00:03:51.340> with<00:03:51.670> my<00:03:51.820> hair

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
to the front and that way the extensions

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.580 
to the front and that way the extensions
will<00:03:54.820> blend<00:03:55.090> perfectly<00:03:55.450> with<00:03:56.019> my<00:03:56.410> natural

that this whole line block look isn't
very<00:04:27.070> many<00:04:27.370> because<00:04:27.490> I<00:04:27.670> know<00:04:27.730> I<00:04:27.970> have<00:04:28.090> a<00:04:28.120> lot<00:04:28.300> of

very many because I know I have a lot of

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.700 
very many because I know I have a lot of
texture<00:04:28.660> here<00:04:28.960> so<00:04:29.140> I<00:04:29.200> want<00:04:29.440> to<00:04:29.500> sort<00:04:29.620> of

texture here so I want to sort of
replicate<00:04:30.310> it<00:04:30.670> a<00:04:30.730> bit<00:04:30.850> on<00:04:30.940> this<00:04:31.030> part<00:04:31.360> so<00:04:31.960> what

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
replicate it a bit on this part so what

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.080 
replicate it a bit on this part so what
I<00:04:32.140> generally<00:04:32.290> do<00:04:32.680> is<00:04:33.100> take<00:04:33.430> some<00:04:33.460> Harrison

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
I generally do is take some Harrison

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.540

scissors<00:04:34.390> like<00:04:34.870> this<00:04:35.080> any<00:04:35.590> sharp<00:04:35.890> sharp

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
scissors like this any sharp sharp

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:37.740 
scissors like this any sharp sharp
scissors<00:04:36.940> will<00:04:37.120> do<00:04:37.240> it<00:04:37.360> that's<00:04:37.570> quite<00:04:37.690> a

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
scissors will do it that's quite a

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.660 
scissors will do it that's quite a
tongue<00:04:37.930> twister<00:04:38.050> to<00:04:38.350> say<00:04:38.500> really<00:04:39.160> and<00:04:39.520> what<00:04:39.640> I

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:39.670 
tongue twister to say really and what I

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.940 
tongue twister to say really and what I
just<00:04:39.910> do<00:04:40.060> is<00:04:40.960> literally<00:04:41.320> go<00:04:41.440> in<00:04:41.680> the<00:04:41.770> mirror

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 
just do is literally go in the mirror

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.970 
just do is literally go in the mirror
and<00:04:42.160> glide<00:04:42.670> I<00:04:43.180> probably<00:04:43.900> want<00:04:44.260> to<00:04:44.290> do<00:04:44.440> a<00:04:44.470> 24
