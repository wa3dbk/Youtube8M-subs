so we're at a another so-called unnamed
hotel<00:00:07.330> and<00:00:09.120> neighbors<00:00:10.120> reported<00:00:10.599> bedbugs

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:11.019 
hotel and neighbors reported bedbugs

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:13.110 
hotel and neighbors reported bedbugs
sight<00:00:11.889> or<00:00:12.099> parts<00:00:12.370> of<00:00:12.429> room<00:00:12.610> which<00:00:12.730> you<00:00:12.820> can<00:00:12.940> see

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:13.120 
sight or parts of room which you can see

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.879 
sight or parts of room which you can see
the<00:00:13.240> headboards<00:00:13.629> off<00:00:13.749> the<00:00:13.900> wall<00:00:14.079> which<00:00:14.740> is

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:14.889 
the headboards off the wall which is

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:17.220 
the headboards off the wall which is
just<00:00:15.099> the<00:00:15.249> typical<00:00:15.519> to<00:00:15.759> look<00:00:15.910> around<00:00:16.180> and<00:00:17.140> the

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:17.230 
just the typical to look around and the

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:18.810 
just the typical to look around and the
first<00:00:17.410> thing<00:00:17.650> I<00:00:17.740> saw<00:00:17.980> and<00:00:18.310> they've<00:00:18.640> been

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:18.820 
first thing I saw and they've been

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.640 
first thing I saw and they've been
sprayed<00:00:19.420> with<00:00:19.449> pyrethroids<00:00:20.140> so<00:00:20.380> that<00:00:20.500> they

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:20.650 
sprayed with pyrethroids so that they

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.650 
sprayed with pyrethroids so that they
will<00:00:21.550> die<00:00:21.730> and<00:00:21.939> not<00:00:22.000> move<00:00:22.179> around<00:00:22.390> they<00:00:22.599> were

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:22.660 
will die and not move around they were

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.829 
will die and not move around they were
alive<00:00:22.990> and<00:00:23.230> moving<00:00:23.410> but<00:00:23.740> you<00:00:23.949> can<00:00:24.099> see<00:00:24.839> right

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:25.839 
alive and moving but you can see right

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:27.779 
alive and moving but you can see right
there<00:00:25.869> so<00:00:26.619> when<00:00:26.859> you<00:00:26.949> take<00:00:27.130> off<00:00:27.279> the<00:00:27.400> headboard

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:27.789 
there so when you take off the headboard

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:28.950 
there so when you take off the headboard
that's<00:00:27.970> exactly<00:00:28.419> what<00:00:28.539> you're<00:00:28.630> going<00:00:28.720> to<00:00:28.779> look

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:28.960 
that's exactly what you're going to look

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.349 
that's exactly what you're going to look
for<00:00:29.230> you<00:00:30.070> see<00:00:30.250> those<00:00:30.460> marks<00:00:30.939> you<00:00:31.029> can<00:00:31.119> see<00:00:31.240> the

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:31.359 
for you see those marks you can see the

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:32.670 
for you see those marks you can see the
bedbugs<00:00:31.720> are<00:00:31.869> moving<00:00:32.110> around<00:00:32.200> a<00:00:32.410> little<00:00:32.500> bit

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 
bedbugs are moving around a little bit

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.250 
bedbugs are moving around a little bit
right<00:00:32.860> now<00:00:33.660> because<00:00:34.660> they're<00:00:34.750> spray<00:00:35.079> they're

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
right now because they're spray they're

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.450 
right now because they're spray they're
going<00:00:35.410> to<00:00:35.469> die<00:00:35.590> pretty<00:00:35.620> soon<00:00:36.100> but<00:00:36.250> you<00:00:36.309> see

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 
going to die pretty soon but you see

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.510 
going to die pretty soon but you see
that<00:00:36.640> that<00:00:37.149> black<00:00:37.570> flaking<00:00:38.379> that's<00:00:39.129> blood

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:39.520 
that that black flaking that's blood

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.459 
that that black flaking that's blood
spots<00:00:39.910> and<00:00:40.180> that's<00:00:40.329> pretty<00:00:40.809> typically<00:00:41.289> what

00:00:41.459 --> 00:00:41.469 
spots and that's pretty typically what

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:43.770 
spots and that's pretty typically what
you'd<00:00:41.590> see<00:00:41.949> if<00:00:42.640> there<00:00:42.850> was<00:00:42.940> an<00:00:43.059> infestation<00:00:43.360> of

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
you'd see if there was an infestation of

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.360 
you'd see if there was an infestation of
bedbugs<00:00:44.670> in<00:00:45.670> your<00:00:46.449> room<00:00:46.600> you<00:00:46.809> can<00:00:46.930> see<00:00:47.280> sort<00:00:48.280> of

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
bedbugs in your room you can see sort of

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.200 
bedbugs in your room you can see sort of
up<00:00:48.969> in<00:00:49.180> there<00:00:49.530> sorry<00:00:50.530> for<00:00:50.649> the<00:00:50.980> bad<00:00:51.579> focusing

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
up in there sorry for the bad focusing

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.880 
up in there sorry for the bad focusing
it's<00:00:52.629> really<00:00:52.899> dark<00:00:53.109> in<00:00:53.320> here<00:00:53.469> so<00:00:53.649> I'm<00:00:53.710> having

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:53.890 
it's really dark in here so I'm having

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:55.619 
it's really dark in here so I'm having
trouble<00:00:54.340> with<00:00:54.910> it<00:00:55.090> but<00:00:55.210> you<00:00:55.300> can<00:00:55.390> see<00:00:55.539> the

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:55.629 
trouble with it but you can see the

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:58.080 
trouble with it but you can see the
bedbugs<00:00:56.019> are<00:00:56.199> moving<00:00:56.410> around<00:00:56.500> real<00:00:56.890> small<00:00:57.340> if

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090 
bedbugs are moving around real small if

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.330 
bedbugs are moving around real small if
you<00:00:58.390> if<00:00:58.570> you<00:00:58.690> figure<00:00:59.019> it<00:00:59.559> on<00:00:59.800> the<00:00:59.920> whole<00:01:00.100> thing

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340 
you if you figure it on the whole thing

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.639 
you if you figure it on the whole thing
I<00:01:00.429> mean<00:01:00.519> if<00:01:00.670> i<00:01:00.760> zoom<00:01:00.789> all<00:01:01.179> the<00:01:01.420> way<00:01:01.539> out<00:01:01.629> you<00:01:02.079> can

00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:02.649 
I mean if i zoom all the way out you can

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:04.500 
I mean if i zoom all the way out you can
see<00:01:02.949> you<00:01:03.429> know<00:01:03.550> there's<00:01:03.760> a<00:01:03.820> regular<00:01:04.300> sized

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:04.510 
see you know there's a regular sized

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:05.130 
see you know there's a regular sized
lamp

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
lamp

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.580 
lamp
there's<00:01:05.680> the<00:01:05.860> bedbugs<00:01:06.250> walking<00:01:06.640> around<00:01:06.880> there

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
there's the bedbugs walking around there

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.149 
there's the bedbugs walking around there
and<00:01:08.590> then<00:01:09.310> if<00:01:09.759> i<00:01:09.880> zoom<00:01:09.909> in<00:01:10.270> just<00:01:10.450> a<00:01:10.750> little<00:01:11.159> see

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
and then if i zoom in just a little see

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:13.679 
and then if i zoom in just a little see
there's<00:01:12.400> one<00:01:12.700> moving<00:01:13.000> around<00:01:13.330> there's

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:13.689 
there's one moving around there's

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:15.510 
there's one moving around there's
another<00:01:13.750> one<00:01:14.110> moving<00:01:14.290> around<00:01:14.530> and<00:01:14.890> all<00:01:15.340> this

another one moving around and all this

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.190 
another one moving around and all this
stuff<00:01:15.670> that's<00:01:16.030> right<00:01:16.210> there<00:01:16.479> what<00:01:16.689> you<00:01:16.720> really

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
stuff that's right there what you really

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.800 
stuff that's right there what you really
can't<00:01:17.409> see<00:01:17.710> very<00:01:17.920> well<00:01:18.040> it's<00:01:18.490> cast<00:01:19.270> skins<00:01:19.659> of

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
can't see very well it's cast skins of

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.749 
can't see very well it's cast skins of
the<00:01:19.960> smaller<00:01:20.320> nymphal<00:01:20.829> end<00:01:21.009> stars<00:01:21.310> and<00:01:21.579> things

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 
the smaller nymphal end stars and things

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:24.060 
the smaller nymphal end stars and things
like<00:01:21.939> that<00:01:22.000> so<00:01:22.380> quite<00:01:23.380> a<00:01:23.409> few<00:01:23.829> of<00:01:23.950> them

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
like that so quite a few of them

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.859 
like that so quite a few of them
actually<00:01:25.170> on<00:01:26.170> this<00:01:26.409> one<00:01:26.590> and<00:01:27.270> hopefully<00:01:28.270> we

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
actually on this one and hopefully we

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:31.620 
actually on this one and hopefully we
can<00:01:29.020> zoom<00:01:29.259> in<00:01:29.560> I<00:01:29.950> got<00:01:30.939> to<00:01:31.030> walk<00:01:31.180> around<00:01:31.479> some

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
can zoom in I got to walk around some

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.100 
can zoom in I got to walk around some
furniture<00:01:31.960> here<00:01:32.320> but<00:01:33.000> and<00:01:34.000> see<00:01:34.329> I'm<00:01:34.930> going<00:01:35.079> to

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
furniture here but and see I'm going to

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.760 
furniture here but and see I'm going to
bring<00:01:35.290> a<00:01:35.380> light<00:01:35.590> over<00:01:35.920> as<00:01:35.979> well<00:01:37.320> this<00:01:38.320> is<00:01:38.530> on

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
bring a light over as well this is on

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.920 
bring a light over as well this is on
the<00:01:39.250> board<00:01:39.549> but<00:01:39.759> you<00:01:39.820> can<00:01:40.030> see<00:01:40.360> you<00:01:40.630> can't

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
the board but you can see you can't

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.859 
the board but you can see you can't
really<00:01:41.140> see<00:01:41.439> in<00:01:41.560> there<00:01:41.740> very<00:01:41.979> well<00:01:42.630> but<00:01:43.630> that

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
really see in there very well but that

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:47.190 
really see in there very well but that
that<00:01:44.790> screw<00:01:45.790> hole<00:01:46.060> that's<00:01:46.299> holding<00:01:46.659> it<00:01:46.750> on<00:01:46.930> is

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
that screw hole that's holding it on is

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.139 
that screw hole that's holding it on is
just<00:01:48.180> completely<00:01:49.180> packed<00:01:49.990> full<00:01:50.500> bedbugs<00:01:51.189> if<00:01:52.030> I

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149 
just completely packed full bedbugs if I

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:53.999 
just completely packed full bedbugs if I
were<00:01:52.210> to<00:01:52.329> spray<00:01:52.659> that<00:01:52.869> right<00:01:53.079> now<00:01:53.229> you<00:01:53.799> can

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:54.009 
were to spray that right now you can
