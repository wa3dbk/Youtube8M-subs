00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.550
 little by little we visit and has returned for tourism the patient had been 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:12.919
 delicate with little difference 

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:17.670
 not distinguish some of the multiple models of switches summit apostles 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.449
 what can we find in the scoreboard 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:23.439
 normally when we talk about swiss min 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:26.439
 electronic device with a washing machine a dishwasher 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:29.949
 we are referring to a popular taxpayer 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:33.509
 similar with what you can see in this margin 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.700
 can contain multiple models sizes and as highlighted 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:47.000
 as you can see 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 such 60 points of levers 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.230
 his 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.230
 in this case simple switch 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.550
 your ex with double circuit like every year 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.270
 Your ex 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.270
 as a child of atocha minutes 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.190
 Your success and wire 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.000
 I am more used in recreational machines for example machines 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.930
 random 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.540
 microsoft xix 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.780
 be it the lever 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.780
 bearing 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.170
 without lever 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.860
 like other small lever models 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.580
 at the same time we also call months what would be push buttons 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.240
 this for example is a very old model corresponding a box 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.240
 register 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.840
 this would belong to a calculator 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.700
 or another model of your ex 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.539
 of other types of machines 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.099
 as well as when it was mounted on cap push-type authors 

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:19.089
 the following in terms of its outer and intercultural little world design 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:22.159
 this is an example 

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:25.449
 of two positions 

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:28.909
 double circuit 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:31.909
 together let's see how he bought years 

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:35.499
 we use the triumph 

00:02:35.499 --> 00:02:38.499
 the faces of children 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.790
 the first thing we do is that he hopes he does not assume that it's working 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:02.939
 from the beep 

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:06.900
 my next step that we will give llasera 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.919
 they checked the facts 

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:11.019
 for example let's check this 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:14.019
 that according to the circuit that has screen-printed 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:17.209
 this would be the common term 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.699
 are normally open and that is a great advantage 

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:24.969
 we have one of the text points already 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:28.319
 in the terminal like him and the other 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:31.629
 we will place it in the terminal normally act 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.149
 they do not mark us now 

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:41.149
 at the moment we press 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:45.299
 the metro will mark the continuity 

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:49.559
 the fire chief 

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:52.919
 in other circuits but we want to check also 

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:55.919
 permanently finished 

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:59.619
 those performances the swiss 

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:04.979
 and the closed circuit 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:10.239
 from there 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:11.899
 that when we talk about the swiss 

00:04:11.899 --> 00:04:14.899
 we always end up without contact as a feed 

00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:16.579
 in contact 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:19.250
 nc pnc is normally approved 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.129
 and in contact 

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:24.129
 we have normal and open 

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:28.189
 we will try one of the chaqueÃ±os 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.180
 in this the ere in these pleasures and is very similar 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:36.529
 the common term 

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:37.680
 the terminal 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.770
 normally open and the terminal usually attack 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:45.590
 The silkscreen can vary so much it can take you all 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:48.009
 my life the faith 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:50.939
 the same 

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:54.239
 or it can be closely related as in this case it takes 1 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:00.039
 we check the second term 

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:02.479
 we use 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:05.819
 the difficult one 

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:08.819
 we buy a circuit normally open 

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:14.210
 in this case as what we are checking are 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.539
 the two friends as you can see 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:21.259
 the Swiss does not mark anything that is totally false 

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:24.509
 we will check in common 

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:27.509
 and normally open 

00:05:33.559 --> 00:05:36.559
 and we can assure that it works perfectly 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:38.650
 the rest of his days 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.999
 they are all checked equally 

00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:44.999
 normally open this many 

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:51.689
 we will include 

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:54.999
 to the police station one of the subsidies the first we've seen 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.169
 in which we can see what if we check 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:02.520
 the two outputs 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.840
 they will not mark any type of continuity at any time 

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:13.680
 and is that both are the outputs of a ciborium with their children 

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:18.229
 we check again 

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:24.449
 with normal normal and open output 

00:06:28.009 --> 00:06:29.639
 multiply 

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:32.639
 until we receive the psoe 

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.569
 Seville 

00:06:35.569 --> 00:06:38.129
 it's normal and klaus 

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:40.349
 this community 

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:43.349
 until here we will insist with this statement 

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:48.719
 this would be the same without incident 

00:06:48.719 --> 00:06:51.389
 for checking a translator 

00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:54.089
 already canned preserves different models 

00:06:54.089 --> 00:06:57.329
 let's use some just to see how they would work 

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:59.849
 we usually have 

00:06:59.849 --> 00:07:01.550
 the common in the center 

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:03.800
 one of the outputs would be 

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:07.199
 it is normally clear that currently open 

00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:08.499
 let's check 

00:07:08.499 --> 00:07:11.499
 some 

00:07:12.539 --> 00:07:15.539
 in this position 

00:07:20.009 --> 00:07:21.699
 the circuit is already closed 

00:07:21.699 --> 00:07:22.889
 on the whole 

00:07:22.889 --> 00:07:25.050
 at the left-side 

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:27.169
 as a second point 

00:07:27.169 --> 00:07:30.139
 we passed open 

00:07:30.139 --> 00:07:32.650
 if we change the clamp 

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:34.190
 we see that they are 

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:37.190
 would correspond to the output 

00:07:38.949 --> 00:07:41.949
 it was played in this case 

00:07:48.559 --> 00:07:50.020
 and 5th 

00:07:50.020 --> 00:07:53.700
 just as it has happened with switches as a switch we have the same 

00:07:53.699 --> 00:07:55.089
 option that 

00:07:55.089 --> 00:07:56.139
 if we check 

00:07:56.139 --> 00:07:59.539
 his two outputs 

00:07:59.539 --> 00:08:02.929
 while the Swiss a singer-songwriter 

00:08:02.929 --> 00:08:04.449
 no gentlemen none 

00:08:04.449 --> 00:08:07.159
 galdos four that we are living are the two outputs
