00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:06.629
 also 4000 thank you 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.710
 just 4,000 people are already there 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.880
 let's imagine that are so many 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.200
 people and definitely right 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.070
 blatant that I have so many people 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.259
 Can entertain 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.700
 I give real lot of effort in which 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.960
 special I hope you like it and yes 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.960
 have fun 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.340
 I will only be 4 km special 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.810
 answer a few questions from you and 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.190
 I had my skin pack and left that 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.760
 I will also be in the video review 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.040
 will 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.690
 So I wish a lot of fun and a lot 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.030
 Let's start with the same 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.930
 first question 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.940
 the first question will be from me 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.320
 Christoph asked he asked me when 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.760
 comes a skin pack and I 'm real 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.170
 always asked yes for them when 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.670
 brings in the skicross I believe already over 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.390
 one year i will always be asked when 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.250
 I finally got a kindberg 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.510
 rausbringen I thought so much 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.070
 carbon special is quite suitable 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.470
 Well, that's why I went to the luggage 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.699
 which includes 12 skins 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.930
 I have the kid myself 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:07.250
 and that was done to me and im 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.869
 so thank jesse in any case 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.979
 close as they are a few 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.150
 parents of the child but also a few 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.250
 new life you probably still 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.750
 just do not know one here 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.190
 blind so you see what kind of child is 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.080
 everything is and I hope you like it 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.110
 that in the description and ya konan 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.090
 immediately to the next question 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.860
 the second question can come from june he can 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.619
 ask me how long does spectator play 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.479
 still active sgs I can not 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.009
 answer so accurately because the date that 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.600
 but I have in my head definitely 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:33.950
 So I'm really really active 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.180
 it starts to play as sg 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.979
 about came out 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.150
 I always had it on display 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:39.830
 server i played what i still here 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.090
 none of the opel games point netease the 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.710
 I believe and there I go 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.729
 played the carlsson random and then 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.409
 sometime played around because 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:46.580
 I have presented within server 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:47.630
 thought so yes does not come with the 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.620
 helicopter and then want to 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.030
 see if a bit it started 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.280
 is going to be more fun than playing 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.920
 that's going on the display server and 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.970
 then yes, I came so often 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.440
 I think I do not know exactly how 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.090
 That's how long he was but me 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.940
 I guess so two years or so 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.080
 I'm not so sure in any case 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.890
 keep up with the server has presented too 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.409
 say come to the next one 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.400
 question 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:08.929
 the next question comes from mister 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.239
 Sandman Harry and he asks me something 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.100
 Do you want to experience or make before 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:15.620
 you die that 's a good question 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.730
 will definitely like it right 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.870
 Many countries are ready for such a 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.580
 world trip would be cool 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.739
 best of all, such an American trip 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.299
 So for the first time in America travel around 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:25.100
 america is best such a mobile with 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:26.239
 any complex or so on 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.190
 In any case , I would like to be honest 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.630
 to experience but otherwise I have 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.360
 not so big I aim simply to 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.920
 to come to me 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.600
 I do not have such big goals 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.080
 somehow more of the world to see and 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.910
 yes the next question comes from google 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.410
 ticks and he asks me what are you doing 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.890
 all those years have come to minecraft 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.480
 coincidence a recommendation and that 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.560
 actually quite by accident I want 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.700
 say because I was up a bit 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.530
 youtube on the go wanted me one 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.850
 watch some call of duty videos because 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.220
 I have a lot of call of duty 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.290
 So played a little rage I katie 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.520
 Incidentally, I'm not proud of that and yes 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.470
 Of course I have also looked around 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.180
 and then slowly the minecraft came 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.410
 hype so many have minecraft 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.340
 I thought that I did that 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.810
 try a game 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.010
 I played correctly for a long time 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.660
 and sometimes I have to stop me then 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.880
 bought a premium account the 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.720
 Incidentally, blog 111 was the blog now 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.910
 first a stroke of force 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:16.510
 and yes, I'm definitely too 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:18.520
 Minecraft come the next question 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.860
 come from the sellin and he asks me 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.820
 what is your goal on youtube and me 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.280
 I must honestly say I have 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:25.989
 not so big goals on youtube 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.430
 of course, is a big moment for me 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:27.989
 In any case, the 10,000 subscribers too 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.950
 crack 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.090
 I want to be huge in any case 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.590
 so probably look great too 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.980
 special give which ever reach 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.630
 will 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.860
 but otherwise I have no goal at all 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.580
 just makes fun more and more people 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.870
 to entertain 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.800
 maybe a bit more active too 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.720
 So more statements will make 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:44.200
 but otherwise I do not really have any 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.760
 so many goals the last question today 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.620
 comes from the troggs and he asks me 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.940
 Are you in the gamescom a good question 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.079
 I'm not so sure yet 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.890
 area life comes so i hope so 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:53.079
 in any case already 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.160
 I have it to 80% year to 20 percent 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:55.540
 no, it all depends on whether to 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.820
 something unexpected happens or so but 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.049
 i definitely hope so and if so 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.280
 I am there then I will know 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:02.110
 But let me say where I am and 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.980
 so then you can meet me on me 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.360
 I'll probably get it somehow 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:04.690
 rocks or something I like 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.209
 times 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.140
 and yes, in case I have it early 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:10.239
 know enough then we can still there 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.000
 somehow the larvae or so on everyone 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:14.350
 Pretty cool to be with you 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.489
 I want the 4000 talents special 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:17.410

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:18.820

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.200

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.440
 because without you I would not be here now 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.550
 where I am now and it got me up 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.330
 Every case that I have so many people 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.240

 rating that could expand because of me 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:34.210

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.130
