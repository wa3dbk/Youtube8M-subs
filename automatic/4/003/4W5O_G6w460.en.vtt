another shuffle drill or dribbling back

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.990 
another shuffle drill or dribbling back
and<00:00:11.110> forth<00:00:11.289> between<00:00:11.440> cones<00:00:11.860> this<00:00:12.760> one<00:00:12.879> we're

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:13.000 
and forth between cones this one we're

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.119 
and forth between cones this one we're
going<00:00:13.090> to<00:00:13.150> work<00:00:13.299> on<00:00:13.449> our<00:00:13.510> outside<00:00:14.080> cut<00:00:14.440> with

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:15.129 
going to work on our outside cut with

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:17.150 
going to work on our outside cut with
our<00:00:15.279> foots<00:00:15.549> or<00:00:15.730> outside<00:00:16.119> change<00:00:16.449> of<00:00:16.570> direction

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
our foots or outside change of direction

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.710 
our foots or outside change of direction
so<00:00:18.160> the<00:00:18.310> outside<00:00:18.430> cuts<00:00:18.880> basically<00:00:19.330> a<00:00:19.359> lot<00:00:19.539> like

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:19.720 
so the outside cuts basically a lot like

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.900 
so the outside cuts basically a lot like
the<00:00:19.839> inside<00:00:20.169> cut<00:00:20.500> and<00:00:21.039> what<00:00:21.189> you're<00:00:21.369> doing<00:00:21.669> is

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:21.910 
the inside cut and what you're doing is

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:23.400 
the inside cut and what you're doing is
you're<00:00:21.939> bringing<00:00:22.359> the<00:00:22.449> ball<00:00:22.570> one<00:00:22.869> direction

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:23.410 
you're bringing the ball one direction

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.769 
you're bringing the ball one direction
and<00:00:23.589> then<00:00:24.339> you're<00:00:24.519> cutting<00:00:24.970> across<00:00:25.240> it<00:00:25.599> with

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:25.779 
and then you're cutting across it with

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:27.569 
and then you're cutting across it with
the<00:00:25.900> outside<00:00:26.259> of<00:00:26.380> your<00:00:26.439> foot<00:00:26.499> and<00:00:27.160> taking<00:00:27.490> you

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:27.579 
the outside of your foot and taking you

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:29.099 
the outside of your foot and taking you
back<00:00:27.699> the<00:00:27.910> other<00:00:27.970> direction<00:00:28.240> so<00:00:28.749> it's<00:00:28.869> almost

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:29.109 
back the other direction so it's almost

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:31.470 
back the other direction so it's almost
kind<00:00:29.259> of<00:00:29.349> a<00:00:29.439> quick<00:00:29.650> chop<00:00:30.609> into<00:00:30.880> the<00:00:31.060> ball<00:00:31.240> like

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.480 
kind of a quick chop into the ball like

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.700 
kind of a quick chop into the ball like
that<00:00:32.220> so<00:00:33.780> if<00:00:34.780> you're<00:00:34.990> bringing<00:00:35.140> the<00:00:35.350> ball<00:00:35.470> this

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
that so if you're bringing the ball this

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.920 
that so if you're bringing the ball this
way<00:00:36.030> you're<00:00:37.030> going<00:00:37.180> to<00:00:37.240> take<00:00:37.360> the<00:00:37.510> outside<00:00:37.810> of

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:37.930 
way you're going to take the outside of

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:46.820 
way you're going to take the outside of
your<00:00:37.990> foot<00:00:38.050> and<00:00:38.230> just<00:00:38.590> kind<00:00:38.770> of<00:00:38.800> cut<00:00:38.980> it<00:00:39.070> back

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:46.830 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.900

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.279 

looking<00:01:32.420> for<00:01:32.570> a<00:01:32.600> little<00:01:32.659> bit<00:01:32.899> of<00:01:33.020> variation

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:33.289 
looking for a little bit of variation

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.420 
what you can do is you can bring the
ball<00:01:35.869> across<00:01:36.140> at<00:01:36.469> your<00:01:36.619> strong<00:01:36.920> foot<00:01:36.950> which

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
ball across at your strong foot which

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
for me is my right cut it back with your

for me is my right cut it back with your
strong<00:01:41.630> foot<00:01:41.659> and<00:01:42.170> then<00:01:43.100> switch<00:01:43.340> to<00:01:43.399> your<00:01:43.700> left

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:43.969 
strong foot and then switch to your left

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:48.219 
strong foot and then switch to your left
or<00:01:44.270> your<00:01:44.299> weak<00:01:44.600> foot<00:01:45.429> back<00:01:46.429> the<00:01:46.579> other<00:01:46.610> way<00:01:47.229> so

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
or your weak foot back the other way so

00:01:48.229 --> 00:02:09.340 
or your weak foot back the other way so
then<00:01:48.409> you're<00:01:48.530> just<00:01:48.560> alternating<00:01:51.460> strong<00:01:52.460> foot

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.860 

so<00:02:10.010> this<00:02:10.160> is<00:02:10.280> a<00:02:10.310> great<00:02:10.550> drill<00:02:10.820> for<00:02:11.090> practicing

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
so this is a great drill for practicing

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.410 
so this is a great drill for practicing
creating<00:02:12.230> space<00:02:12.530> from<00:02:12.740> defenders<00:02:13.190> so<00:02:13.790> imagine

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
creating space from defenders so imagine

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.670 
creating space from defenders so imagine
you're<00:02:14.510> running<00:02:14.840> down<00:02:14.870> the<00:02:15.080> field<00:02:15.230> this<00:02:15.470> way

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
you're running down the field this way

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.350 
you're running down the field this way
you've<00:02:16.190> got<00:02:16.370> the<00:02:16.490> ball<00:02:16.670> of<00:02:16.790> your<00:02:16.850> foot<00:02:17.090> here

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
you've got the ball of your foot here

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.720 
you've got the ball of your foot here
and<00:02:17.570> you've<00:02:18.230> got<00:02:18.350> a<00:02:18.410> defender<00:02:18.920> on<00:02:19.100> your<00:02:19.310> inside

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
and you've got a defender on your inside

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.940 
and you've got a defender on your inside
you<00:02:20.510> can't<00:02:20.780> cut<00:02:20.960> the<00:02:20.990> ball<00:02:21.290> back<00:02:21.470> this<00:02:21.740> way

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
you can't cut the ball back this way

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.680 
you can't cut the ball back this way
because<00:02:22.550> he's<00:02:22.880> right<00:02:23.060> here<00:02:23.270> and<00:02:23.360> you'll<00:02:23.450> steal
