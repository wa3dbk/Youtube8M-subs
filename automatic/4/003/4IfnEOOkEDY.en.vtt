00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.910
 at the vegetable theater for the summer season of the Palermo maximum theater 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.330

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.670
 darlings of the great TV audience the beautiful and eclectic rossella brescia

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.690
 yesterday on television today on the stage of meat-filled vegetable theater 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.310
 well let's say they are completely different motions because in short 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.870
 tonight for me 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.650
 it's really euro 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:05.080
 I don't know how here an important destination to reach so in short I put it 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.899
 all that adrenaline big city always 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:10.899
 and for you like the show 

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:32.689
 luciano cannito director of the dance company of the maritime theater set up for 

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:33.650
 his flesh 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.710
 a non-narrative choreography imagining to set the story 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:43.580
 the island of lampedusa instead narrative my carmen only kendo transported 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.920
 in our days because in my opinion carmen is a universal character 

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:50.400
 that is, if you say carmen think 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.080
 a woman of freedom of force has a woman who is not afraid 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.209
 tv and the one that thinks about living according to what you think is right 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.819
 so this is not a story that belongs only to the 1800s a story 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:03.869
 which belongs 

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:06.679
 the world at all times 

00:03:06.679 --> 00:03:11.329
 or of the lampedusa refugees of desperate people seemed to me a very base 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:14.299
 beautiful speech of this same story 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:16.839

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:22.109

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:26.149

00:03:35.029 --> 00:03:40.359

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:42.239
 the text below 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.889
 and I really liked this thing because it's not just a job 

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:48.889
 choreographic dance is very very theatrical 

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:54.859

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:57.449

 it is very welcoming and at the same time the teacher is so it really is 

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:07.490
 finished pot 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:11.120
 it is as if I were a theater so it was at the maximum theater in short, however 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.180

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.459
