00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
do by tones on protected servers than

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.049 
do by tones on protected servers than
one<00:00:12.300> point<00:00:12.540> two<00:00:12.660> point<00:00:12.840> four<00:00:13.049> so<00:00:13.969> pretty<00:00:14.969> much

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
one point two point four so pretty much

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.439 
one point two point four so pretty much
the<00:00:15.240> idea<00:00:15.269> behind<00:00:15.750> us<00:00:16.049> is<00:00:16.260> you<00:00:16.619> need<00:00:16.800> a<00:00:16.830> friend

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:17.449 
the idea behind us is you need a friend

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:21.560 
the idea behind us is you need a friend
that's<00:00:18.449> it<00:00:18.660> and<00:00:19.730> the<00:00:20.730> end<00:00:21.060> of<00:00:21.150> Cerberus

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
that's it and the end of Cerberus

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.590 
that's it and the end of Cerberus
protections<00:00:22.560> or<00:00:22.830> factions<00:00:23.460> or<00:00:23.730> whatever<00:00:24.180> yeah

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
protections or factions or whatever yeah

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.939 
protections or factions or whatever yeah
so<00:00:25.019> pretty<00:00:25.199> much<00:00:25.260> what<00:00:25.439> i've<00:00:25.560> done<00:00:25.710> here<00:00:25.769> is

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
so pretty much what i've done here is

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.769 
so pretty much what i've done here is
I've<00:00:26.099> claimed<00:00:26.430> this<00:00:26.609> lame<00:00:26.849> but<00:00:27.029> William<00:00:27.449> here

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
I've claimed this lame but William here

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.740 
I've claimed this lame but William here
say<00:00:28.560> it's<00:00:28.890> not<00:00:29.150> it's<00:00:30.150> not<00:00:30.240> part<00:00:30.599> of<00:00:30.660> the

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
say it's not it's not part of the

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.400 
say it's not it's not part of the
faction<00:00:31.260> yes<00:00:31.920> so<00:00:32.550> um<00:00:32.730> we're<00:00:33.329> gonna<00:00:33.450> exhibit

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
faction yes so um we're gonna exhibit

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.639 
faction yes so um we're gonna exhibit
how<00:00:34.559> this<00:00:34.739> works<00:00:35.010> so<00:00:35.489> I'll<00:00:35.790> place<00:00:36.450> this<00:00:37.200> iron

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
how this works so I'll place this iron

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.479 
how this works so I'll place this iron
block<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.820> foundation<00:00:39.780> of<00:00:40.250> Minecraft<00:00:41.250> right

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
block the foundation of Minecraft right

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.520 
block the foundation of Minecraft right
here<00:00:41.820> in<00:00:42.180> my<00:00:42.300> territory<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.780> he'll<00:00:43.230> try<00:00:43.469> and

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
here in my territory and he'll try and

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.639 
here in my territory and he'll try and
attempt<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:43.950> mine<00:00:44.190> it<00:00:45.170> knowing<00:00:46.170> that<00:00:46.200> we<00:00:46.440> can't

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
attempt to mine it knowing that we can't

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.889 
attempt to mine it knowing that we can't
break<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:47.010> block<00:00:47.219> it'll<00:00:48.030> still<00:00:48.420> drop<00:00:48.719> the

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
break the block it'll still drop the

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.020 
break the block it'll still drop the
block<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.890> can<00:00:50.160> just<00:00:50.309> reap<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:51.000> glory

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
block and you can just reap the glory

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.689 
block and you can just reap the glory
from<00:00:51.600> that<00:00:52.820> so<00:00:53.820> there<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.149> go<00:00:54.500> like<00:00:55.699> five

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
from that so there you go like five

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.349 
from that so there you go like five
seconds<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.449> i'm<00:00:57.600> already<00:00:57.960> up<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.969> ten<00:00:59.969> iron

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
seconds and i'm already up to ten iron

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.160 
seconds and i'm already up to ten iron
blocks<00:01:00.719> which<00:01:01.079> is<00:01:01.320> 90<00:01:02.010> iron<00:01:02.340> ingots<00:01:02.910> I<00:01:03.239> mean

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
blocks which is 90 iron ingots I mean

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.910 
blocks which is 90 iron ingots I mean
we're<00:01:04.439> on<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.589> roll<00:01:04.890> already<00:01:06.110> okay<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.409> now

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
we're on a roll already okay and now

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.380 
we're on a roll already okay and now
that<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.159> have<00:01:08.189> your<00:01:08.280> iron<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:09.090> can<00:01:09.119> then

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
that you have your iron you can then

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.690 
that you have your iron you can then
move<00:01:09.540> on<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.960> next<00:01:10.290> step<00:01:10.380> up<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:11.340> can<00:01:11.460> start

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
move on to a next step up you can start

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.270 
move on to a next step up you can start
mining<00:01:11.970> this<00:01:12.270> big<00:01:12.570> diamond<00:01:13.110> blocks<00:01:13.439> William

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
mining this big diamond blocks William

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:23.539 
mining this big diamond blocks William
oh<00:01:18.680> my<00:01:19.680> god<00:01:20.840> Diamond<00:01:21.890> scattering<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:23.040> freeware

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
oh my god Diamond scattering it freeware

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.100 
oh my god Diamond scattering it freeware
now<00:01:23.880> if<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.180> have<00:01:24.270> something<00:01:24.509> like<00:01:24.720> notice

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
now if you have something like notice

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.010 
now if you have something like notice
you<00:01:25.259> can<00:01:25.380> just<00:01:25.530> turn<00:01:25.680> on<00:01:25.770> auto<00:01:26.100> mine<00:01:26.430> and<00:01:26.700> just

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
you can just turn on auto mine and just

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.600 
you can just turn on auto mine and just
have<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.229> thing<00:01:28.470> flooding<00:01:29.040> out<00:01:29.189> of<00:01:29.340> there

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
have the thing flooding out of there

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.370 
have the thing flooding out of there
okay<00:01:30.570> I<00:01:31.110> think<00:01:31.350> we're<00:01:31.710> good<00:01:32.210> and<00:01:33.210> now<00:01:33.990> once<00:01:34.229> you

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
okay I think we're good and now once you

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.950 
okay I think we're good and now once you
have<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.590> have<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.549> diamond<00:01:36.240> you<00:01:36.570> know<00:01:36.689> you<00:01:36.750> do<00:01:36.930> a

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
have a have a diamond you know you do a

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.380 
have a have a diamond you know you do a
diamond<00:01:37.409> you<00:01:37.770> might<00:01:37.920> obsidian<00:01:38.460> now<00:01:39.180> this

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
diamond you might obsidian now this

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.730 
diamond you might obsidian now this
takes<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.750> bit<00:01:39.900> longer<00:01:39.930> because<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.590> whole

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
takes a bit longer because the whole

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.679 
takes a bit longer because the whole
theory<00:01:41.070> behind<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.610> is<00:01:41.820> that<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:42.329> do<00:01:42.509> actually

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
theory behind it is that you do actually

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.649 
theory behind it is that you do actually
have<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:43.020> mind<00:01:43.200> of<00:01:43.320> walk<00:01:43.530> but<00:01:44.100> uh<00:01:44.130> so<00:01:45.090> give<00:01:45.630> it

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
have the mind of walk but uh so give it

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.950 
have the mind of walk but uh so give it
a<00:01:45.750> moment<00:01:46.189> William<00:01:47.189> yeah<00:01:47.460> what<00:01:48.240> i'm<00:01:48.360> doing<00:01:48.780> is

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
a moment William yeah what i'm doing is

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.590 
a moment William yeah what i'm doing is
i'm<00:01:49.229> using<00:01:49.740> fast<00:01:50.009> break<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.670> setting<00:01:51.299> it<00:01:51.390> to

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
i'm using fast break and setting it to

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.109 
i'm using fast break and setting it to
insta<00:01:52.140> break<00:01:52.369> but<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.670> thing<00:01:53.850> is<00:01:53.880> with

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
insta break but the thing is with

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.999 
insta break but the thing is with
obsidian<00:01:54.420> is<00:01:54.810> that<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.170> do<00:01:55.380> actually<00:01:55.590> have<00:01:55.829> to

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
obsidian is that you do actually have to

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.450 
obsidian is that you do actually have to
break<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.369> block<00:01:56.610> so<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:57.930> see<00:01:58.170> it'll<00:01:58.799> pop<00:01:59.280> out

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
break the block so you see it'll pop out

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.850 
break the block so you see it'll pop out
there<00:01:59.759> so<00:02:00.360> takes<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.719> while<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:01.079> break<00:02:01.259> but<00:02:01.770> at

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
there so takes a while to break but at

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.789 
there so takes a while to break but at
the<00:02:01.979> same<00:02:02.189> time<00:02:02.430> it<00:02:02.850> you<00:02:03.299> know<00:02:03.450> is<00:02:03.689> as<00:02:03.990> fast<00:02:04.590> as

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
the same time it you know is as fast as

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.440 
the same time it you know is as fast as
mine<00:02:04.979> obsidian<00:02:05.219> but<00:02:05.790> it's<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.270> lot<00:02:06.420> more

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
mine obsidian but it's a lot more

which<00:02:40.319> is<00:02:40.470> something<00:02:40.709> we<00:02:41.010> wanted<00:02:41.310> to<00:02:41.370> try<00:02:41.550> to

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
which is something we wanted to try to

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.640 
which is something we wanted to try to
do<00:02:41.880> in<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:42.660> beginning<00:02:42.780> because<00:02:43.110> I<00:02:43.319> would<00:02:43.470> mean
