00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.030 
Bluetooth Sirus XM a bunch of cool
features<00:02:46.820> I<00:02:47.820> put<00:02:48.390> in<00:02:48.510> a<00:02:48.770> originally<00:02:49.770> I<00:02:49.800> had<00:02:49.860> a

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
features I put in a originally I had a

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.630 
features I put in a originally I had a
an<00:02:50.790> external<00:02:51.660> speaker<00:02:51.780> in<00:02:52.320> the<00:02:52.560> trunk<00:02:52.890> and<00:02:53.160> I

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
an external speaker in the trunk and I

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.330 
an external speaker in the trunk and I
connected<00:02:54.090> it<00:02:54.180> through<00:02:54.390> a<00:02:54.420> wire<00:02:54.720> and<00:02:55.410> I<00:02:56.100> think

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
connected it through a wire and I think

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:02.150 
connected it through a wire and I think
you<00:02:56.430> can<00:02:56.550> see<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:56.820> wire<00:02:58.340> over<00:02:59.340> here<00:03:00.980> and<00:03:01.980> the

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
you can see the wire over here and the

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.540 
you can see the wire over here and the
wire<00:03:02.430> and<00:03:03.350> I'd<00:03:04.350> it<00:03:04.530> go<00:03:04.920> through<00:03:05.130> the<00:03:05.310> back<00:03:05.520> of

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
wire and I'd it go through the back of

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.900 
wire and I'd it go through the back of
the<00:03:05.790> car<00:03:06.030> and<00:03:06.590> that<00:03:07.590> was<00:03:07.680> quite<00:03:07.830> fun<00:03:08.160> during

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
the car and that was quite fun during

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.260
