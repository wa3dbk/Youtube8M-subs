00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.410
 hello everyone how welcome they were 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.809
 once again this time I bring you one 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.120
 recipe for rice to butter super 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:16.400
 super rich so I hope you like it 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.400
 and try and well let's start 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.700
 what we are going to use is going to be rice 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:25.000
 I used a cup you can use more or 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.000
 less 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.370
 vegetables you can use frozen or in 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.250
 can 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:34.690
 also the and for this it is optional but 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.580
 you can add real potatoes that 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.400
 it tastes super rich or any vegetable that 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:41.820
 you like about 3 tablespoons of 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.820
 Butter 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:48.230
 a branch and a half of celery this is going to 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:51.230
 give a super rich flavor 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:54.400
 and powder chicken broth or can be 2 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.400
 liters of chicken broth 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.110
 before starting I want to clarify if 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.229
 you're going to make a cup of rice you should 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.479
 add 2 cups of water or broth 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.210
 they are going to make 2 cups of rice 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.490
 add double or 4 cups of broth 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.950
 and if it's going to be anything more than half 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.920
 of a cup you are only going to add 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.990
 a cup of water or chicken stock and 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.790
 well let's start by rinsing very 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.159
 well our rice to take away everything 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.840
 that white that goes out that is to my gift that 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.990
 makes our rice look like this 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.570
 it looks like more sticky we're going to 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.729
 play it very well this we are going to 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.880
 do half an hour or 15 minutes before 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.880
 make the rice later we are going to leave it 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.880
 draining 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:46.030
 and then later in a pot previously 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.460
 hot we are going to add oil and 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.900
 let's start to brown our rice and 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.240
 now we have high flame so that 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.750
 brown faster but that does not stop 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.750
 move it 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.349
 and after the knee was started 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:10.500
 bend more or less like you can 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:10.500
 watch 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.670
 it means that it is ready or you can 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.130
 doubt it a bit more then we'll leave 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.080
 to add two cups of water or two 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.230
 cups of chicken broth and we're going to 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.180
 raise the flame to the highest 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.129
 like mine was water I'm going to do it 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.590
 sound great with this chicken stock 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:31.659
 in powder this is to taste so see what 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.180
 testing and when you see that you are ready 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:37.110
 of salt or seasoning now we are going to 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.110
 add the vegetable 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.049
 I like to add too much 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:45.450
 vegetable so you can add less 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:48.920
 or more after the three tablespoons of 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.920
 butter and celery 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.390
 now let's wait for the first 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.660
 boil because it's boiling too much 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:01.720
 now we are going to cover it very well and 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.730
 let's go down to the shortest flame and 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.930
 so we're going to leave you for 25 minutes 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.930
 half an hour 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.250
 what happened that time, let's review 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:19.129
 what still has water and as we can see 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:22.190
 this does not have water anymore and the rice is already 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:24.260
 ready already looks like a little exploited in 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.750
 If you lack water, add 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.060
 more hot broth or water with a little 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.650
 of seasoning if it is ready we turn it off and 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.510
 well now we have that's how we 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.250
 our rice is left so I hope that 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.410
