00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
all of that I think the common thread is

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.819 
all of that I think the common thread is
I'm<00:00:57.270> really<00:00:57.719> delighted<00:00:58.199> with<00:00:58.710> humanity<00:00:59.579> and

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.000 
I'm really delighted with humanity and
expression<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.039> gesture<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:03.739> there's<00:01:04.739> often

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
expression and gesture and there's often

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.630 
expression and gesture and there's often
like<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.729> playfulness<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.900> a<00:01:07.890> little<00:01:08.369> bit<00:01:08.520> of

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
like a playfulness and a little bit of

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.080 
like a playfulness and a little bit of
humor<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.750> little<00:01:10.650> bit<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.860> wit<00:01:11.460> I<00:01:11.700> think

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
humor and a little bit of wit I think

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.120 
humor and a little bit of wit I think
and<00:01:12.439> on<00:01:13.439> top<00:01:13.830> of<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.840> they're<00:01:15.840> very

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
and on top of that they're very

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.770 
and on top of that they're very
sentimental<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.369> think<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.090> way<00:01:18.210> you<00:01:18.270> do<00:01:18.570> that

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
sentimental I think the way you do that

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.830 
sentimental I think the way you do that
is<00:01:20.390> by<00:01:21.390> really<00:01:22.350> being<00:01:22.700> interested<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:24.299> being

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
is by really being interested and being

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.530 
is by really being interested and being
curious<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:26.030> being<00:01:27.890> open<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.159> just<00:01:29.850> noticing

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
something and it could be something so

something and it could be something so
unexpected<00:03:35.670> and<00:03:36.510> I<00:03:37.080> think<00:03:37.350> that<00:03:37.500> that's

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
unexpected and I think that that's

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.420 
unexpected and I think that that's
really<00:03:38.070> important<00:03:38.700> is<00:03:38.760> to<00:03:38.820> be<00:03:39.060> the<00:03:39.900> observer

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
really important is to be the observer

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.500 
really important is to be the observer

better to have fewer big ones because a
bunch<00:04:26.430> of<00:04:26.550> little<00:04:26.790> cards<00:04:27.150> is<00:04:27.300> just<00:04:27.480> more<00:04:27.690> stuff

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
bunch of little cards is just more stuff

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.160 
bunch of little cards is just more stuff
to<00:04:28.139> mess<00:04:28.350> with<00:04:28.560> I<00:04:28.830> really<00:04:29.460> believe<00:04:29.820> that<00:04:30.770> most

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:33.170 
to mess with I really believe that most

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:35.600 
to mess with I really believe that most
problems<00:04:34.170> with<00:04:34.380> CF<00:04:34.650> cards<00:04:34.950> is<00:04:35.070> human<00:04:35.460> error

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
problems with CF cards is human error

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.990 
problems with CF cards is human error
it's<00:04:35.940> not<00:04:36.150> hard<00:04:36.570> mirror<00:04:37.290> so<00:04:38.100> that's<00:04:38.370> why<00:04:38.610> I

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
it's not hard mirror so that's why I

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.210 
it's not hard mirror so that's why I
shoot<00:04:39.660> on<00:04:39.810> big<00:04:40.050> cards<00:04:40.440> and<00:04:40.620> I<00:04:40.680> keep<00:04:40.889> it<00:04:41.010> really

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 
shoot on big cards and I keep it really

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.020 
shoot on big cards and I keep it really
simple<00:04:41.660> partly<00:04:42.660> because<00:04:42.840> of<00:04:43.880> losing<00:04:44.880> it<00:04:44.970> but

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
simple partly because of losing it but

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:46.280 
simple partly because of losing it but
also<00:04:45.180> because<00:04:45.480> you<00:04:45.630> don't<00:04:45.780> want<00:04:45.900> to<00:04:45.960> interrupt

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
also because you don't want to interrupt

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.170 
also because you don't want to interrupt
your<00:04:46.650> train<00:04:46.950> of<00:04:46.980> thought<00:04:47.100> you<00:04:47.880> want<00:04:48.030> to<00:04:48.090> be

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
your train of thought you want to be

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.210 
your train of thought you want to be
able<00:04:48.240> to<00:04:48.360> just<00:04:48.570> keep<00:04:48.720> shooting<00:04:48.960> so<00:04:49.860> I<00:04:49.889> tell

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
able to just keep shooting so I tell

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.159 
able to just keep shooting so I tell
people<00:04:50.250> it's<00:04:51.240> better<00:04:51.450> have<00:04:51.630> fewer<00:04:51.900> large

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:52.169 
people it's better have fewer large

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:54.170 
people it's better have fewer large
cards<00:04:52.860> and<00:04:53.100> it's<00:04:53.250> great<00:04:53.490> now<00:04:53.669> cuz<00:04:53.880> now<00:04:54.030> they
