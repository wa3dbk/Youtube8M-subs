easy<00:02:23.829> okay<00:02:24.760> so<00:02:25.150> let's<00:02:25.450> just<00:02:25.510> get<00:02:25.780> started<00:02:25.989> with

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
easy okay so let's just get started with

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.870 
easy okay so let's just get started with
a<00:02:26.320> project<00:02:26.860> now<00:02:28.890> so<00:02:29.890> the<00:02:30.040> first<00:02:30.250> thing<00:02:30.489> to<00:02:30.640> do

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
a project now so the first thing to do

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.800 
a project now so the first thing to do
is<00:02:31.269> just<00:02:31.840> to<00:02:31.959> cut<00:02:32.230> your<00:02:33.120> sleeves<00:02:34.120> the<00:02:34.630> right

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
is just to cut your sleeves the right

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.020 
is just to cut your sleeves the right
length<00:02:35.079> so<00:02:35.739> we<00:02:35.920> want<00:02:36.100> it<00:02:36.190> to<00:02:36.310> be<00:02:36.459> high<00:02:36.880> enough

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
length so we want it to be high enough

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.490 
length so we want it to be high enough
that<00:02:37.360> it's<00:02:37.450> going<00:02:37.540> to<00:02:37.600> stick<00:02:37.840> out<00:02:37.989> above<00:02:38.320> the

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
that it's going to stick out above the

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.850 
that it's going to stick out above the
boot<00:02:39.959> but<00:02:40.959> it<00:02:41.079> doesn't<00:02:41.320> have<00:02:41.410> to<00:02:41.470> go<00:02:41.620> all<00:02:41.829> the

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
boot but it doesn't have to go all the

boot but it doesn't have to go all the
way<00:02:42.040> down<00:02:42.340> unless<00:02:42.670> you<00:02:42.820> want<00:02:43.090> it<00:02:43.180> to<00:02:43.239> but<00:02:43.660> for

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810

way down unless you want it to but for
this<00:02:43.989> in<00:02:44.440> this<00:02:44.680> case<00:02:44.980> I'm<00:02:45.190> just<00:02:45.370> gonna<00:02:45.519> cut<00:02:45.820> it

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250

eggs<00:05:04.250> hold<00:05:05.250> on<00:05:08.120> like<00:05:09.120> that<00:05:09.360> till<00:05:09.599> the<00:05:09.659> rim<00:05:09.810> is

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
eggs hold on like that till the rim is

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:16.189 
eggs hold on like that till the rim is
attached<00:05:10.289> all<00:05:10.650> the<00:05:10.770> way<00:05:10.889> around<00:05:11.219> so<00:05:14.960> I'm<00:05:15.960> just

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:16.199 
attached all the way around so I'm just

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:20.629 
attached all the way around so I'm just
at<00:05:16.319> the<00:05:16.379> end<00:05:16.680> here<00:05:17.900> this<00:05:18.900> is<00:05:19.050> really<00:05:19.650> easy

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:20.639 
at the end here this is really easy

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:22.670 
at the end here this is really easy
it<00:05:21.000> just<00:05:21.240> takes<00:05:21.509> just<00:05:21.780> a<00:05:21.900> little<00:05:22.319> bit<00:05:22.560> of

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
it just takes just a little bit of

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.820 
it just takes just a little bit of
patience<00:05:23.389> there's<00:05:24.389> going<00:05:24.659> around<00:05:25.409> the<00:05:25.620> top

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
patience there's going around the top

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.439 
patience there's going around the top
there<00:05:26.750> all<00:05:27.750> right<00:05:27.960> I<00:05:28.520> overlapped<00:05:29.520> my<00:05:29.789> ribbon
