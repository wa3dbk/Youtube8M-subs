out there I've played a bit of it myself
and<00:00:13.469> I<00:00:13.590> thought<00:00:13.620> maybe<00:00:14.160> I<00:00:14.280> would<00:00:14.400> share<00:00:14.730> some

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
and I thought maybe I would share some

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.840 
and I thought maybe I would share some
of<00:00:15.059> my<00:00:15.299> hiding<00:00:15.690> spots<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.670> running<00:00:17.670> away<00:00:17.789> from

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
of my hiding spots and running away from

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.880 
of my hiding spots and running away from
Michael<00:00:18.150> Myers<00:00:18.449> junk<00:00:18.930> that<00:00:19.080> I<00:00:19.230> found<00:00:19.560> while

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
Michael Myers junk that I found while

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.630 
Michael Myers junk that I found while
playing<00:00:20.160> it<00:00:20.310> so<00:00:21.650> let's<00:00:22.650> get<00:00:22.769> started<00:00:22.920> this<00:00:23.369> is

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
playing it so let's get started this is

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.400 
playing it so let's get started this is
for<00:00:23.910> the<00:00:23.939> OPFOR<00:00:25.070> defenders<00:00:26.070> spawn<00:00:26.430> or<00:00:27.109> top<00:00:28.109> as

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
for the OPFOR defenders spawn or top as

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.400 
for the OPFOR defenders spawn or top as
most<00:00:28.619> would<00:00:28.830> say<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:29.599> this<00:00:30.599> place<00:00:30.900> is<00:00:31.140> really

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
most would say and this place is really

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.100 
most would say and this place is really
easy<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.859> get<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.219> but<00:00:32.579> from<00:00:33.059> my<00:00:33.300> experiences

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
easy to get to but from my experiences

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.110 
easy to get to but from my experiences
no<00:00:34.649> one<00:00:34.800> really<00:00:34.980> looks<00:00:35.309> here<00:00:35.640> because<00:00:35.969> it's

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
no one really looks here because it's

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.299 
no one really looks here because it's
kind<00:00:36.329> of<00:00:36.390> out<00:00:36.540> of<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.719> way<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:37.230> there's<00:00:38.070> an

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
kind of out of the way and there's an

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.580 
kind of out of the way and there's an
opposite<00:00:38.879> side<00:00:39.239> that<00:00:39.600> people<00:00:39.930> usually<00:00:40.140> look

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
opposite side that people usually look

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.549 
opposite side that people usually look
at<00:00:40.800> not<00:00:41.640> not<00:00:42.420> towards<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.750> left<00:00:43.079> their<00:00:43.320> butt

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
at not not towards the left their butt

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.410 
at not not towards the left their butt
over<00:00:43.829> here<00:00:43.860> is<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.489> good<00:00:44.789> place<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.270> hide

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
over here is a good place to hide

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.690 
over here is a good place to hide
because<00:00:45.719> people<00:00:46.620> usually<00:00:46.770> check<00:00:47.190> over<00:00:47.460> on<00:00:47.579> the

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
because people usually check over on the

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.430 
because people usually check over on the
other<00:00:47.730> side<00:00:47.969> or<00:00:48.329> on<00:00:48.450> top<00:00:48.629> of<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.899> rock<00:00:49.140> that's

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
other side or on top of the rock that's

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.069 
other side or on top of the rock that's
above<00:00:49.860> you<00:00:50.070> because<00:00:50.820> those<00:00:51.510> are<00:00:51.690> both<00:00:51.809> good

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
above you because those are both good

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.660 
above you because those are both good
places<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.500> hide<00:00:52.739> but<00:00:53.010> this<00:00:53.190> is<00:00:53.309> one<00:00:53.460> place

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
places to hide but this is one place

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.160 
places to hide but this is one place
that<00:00:53.699> people<00:00:53.940> just<00:00:54.210> don't<00:00:54.420> normally<00:00:54.840> check

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
that people just don't normally check

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.170 
that people just don't normally check
it's<00:00:55.770> not<00:00:55.920> very<00:00:55.980> hidden<00:00:56.489> like<00:00:56.789> people<00:00:57.059> can

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
it's not very hidden like people can

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.920 
it's not very hidden like people can
easily<00:00:57.390> see<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:57.960> but<00:00:58.170> you<00:00:58.710> know<00:00:59.600> next<00:01:00.600> part

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
easily see you but you know next part

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.240 
easily see you but you know next part
next<00:01:01.710> place<00:01:02.100> is<00:01:02.899> probably<00:01:03.899> not<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.409> very<00:01:04.470> great

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
next place is probably not a very great

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.310 
next place is probably not a very great
one<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.760> this<00:01:06.210> only<00:01:06.360> works<00:01:06.600> if<00:01:06.840> michael<00:01:07.140> myers

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
one and this only works if michael myers

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.440 
one and this only works if michael myers
goes<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.010> right<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.580> rule<00:01:08.880> of<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.270> big

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
goes to the right of the rule of the big

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.770 
goes to the right of the rule of the big
rock<00:01:09.720> cluster<00:01:10.610> when<00:01:11.610> he<00:01:11.790> force<00:01:12.030> ponds<00:01:12.540> which

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
rock cluster when he force ponds which

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.630 
rock cluster when he force ponds which
i'll<00:01:12.960> show<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.200> later<00:01:13.470> which<00:01:13.950> is<00:01:14.070> kind<00:01:14.580> of

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
i'll show you later which is kind of

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.030 
i'll show you later which is kind of
what<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:14.880> do<00:01:15.140> anyway<00:01:16.140> so<00:01:16.259> if<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.710> sit<00:01:17.009> right

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
what you do anyway so if you sit right

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.490 
what you do anyway so if you sit right
here<00:01:17.340> if<00:01:17.850> you<00:01:17.909> come<00:01:18.570> if<00:01:18.780> he<00:01:18.840> goes<00:01:19.049> around<00:01:19.170> the

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
here if you come if he goes around the

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.160 
here if you come if he goes around the
other<00:01:19.680> side<00:01:20.330> there's<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.390> possibility<00:01:21.869> he

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
other side there's a possibility he

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.880 
other side there's a possibility he
might<00:01:22.320> come<00:01:22.500> back<00:01:22.560> through<00:01:22.920> but<00:01:23.189> anyway<00:01:24.890> so

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
might come back through but anyway so

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.370 
might come back through but anyway so
here<00:01:26.189> we<00:01:26.310> go<00:01:26.520> this<00:01:27.180> is<00:01:27.330> only<00:01:27.479> attackers<00:01:28.080> side

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
here we go this is only attackers side

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.310 
here we go this is only attackers side
or<00:01:28.650> bottom<00:01:29.009> I<00:01:29.520> believe<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.240> so<00:01:30.990> if<00:01:31.079> you<00:01:31.170> go

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
or bottom I believe and so if you go

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.469 
or bottom I believe and so if you go
right<00:01:31.590> here<00:01:32.070> underneath<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.729> plane's<00:01:32.970> wing

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
right here underneath the plane's wing

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.890 
right here underneath the plane's wing
as<00:01:33.780> close<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.920> that<00:01:35.070> little<00:01:35.310> curved<00:01:35.939> engine

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
as close to that little curved engine

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.880 
as close to that little curved engine
port<00:01:37.229> or<00:01:37.409> something<00:01:37.890> as<00:01:38.009> you<00:01:38.130> can<00:01:39.259> it's<00:01:40.259> kind

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
port or something as you can it's kind

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.560 
port or something as you can it's kind
of<00:01:40.950> hard<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.159> see<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.579> unless<00:01:41.820> they<00:01:42.030> literally

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
of hard to see you unless they literally

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.840 
of hard to see you unless they literally
come<00:01:42.960> over<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.470> get<00:01:43.920> in<00:01:44.159> there<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.399> look<00:01:44.729> at

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
come over and get in there and look at

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.749 
come over and get in there and look at
you<00:01:45.000> so<00:01:45.869> that's<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.290> good<00:01:46.380> place<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.770> be<00:01:46.950> next

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
you so that's a good place to be next

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.160 
you so that's a good place to be next
place<00:01:47.970> is<00:01:48.710> probably<00:01:49.710> an<00:01:50.100> obvious<00:01:50.640> place<00:01:51.299> like

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
place is probably an obvious place like

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.719 
place is probably an obvious place like
most<00:01:52.470> michael<00:01:52.890> myers<00:01:53.070> if<00:01:53.340> they've<00:01:53.520> been

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
most michael myers if they've been

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.370 
most michael myers if they've been
playing<00:01:54.390> on<00:01:54.570> this<00:01:54.600> map<00:01:54.869> before<00:01:55.020> they'll

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
playing on this map before they'll

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.109 
playing on this map before they'll
probably<00:01:55.590> look<00:01:55.860> here<00:01:56.189> but<00:01:56.700> if<00:01:56.790> you<00:01:56.880> laid<00:01:57.090> down

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
probably look here but if you laid down

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.719 
probably look here but if you laid down
here<00:01:57.810> then<00:01:58.170> they<00:01:58.619> can't<00:01:58.890> see<00:01:59.070> over<00:01:59.219> it<00:01:59.490> without

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
here then they can't see over it without

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.639 
here then they can't see over it without
coming<00:02:00.450> they<00:02:00.689> can't<00:02:00.869> see<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:01.140> without<00:02:01.259> coming

was chasing you from right there where
I'm<00:02:19.069> about<00:02:19.310> to<00:02:19.490> shoot<00:02:20.800> now<00:02:21.800> this<00:02:22.160> is<00:02:22.340> a<00:02:22.370> plate

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
I'm about to shoot now this is a plate

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.480 
I'm about to shoot now this is a plate
this<00:02:22.880> is<00:02:23.000> a<00:02:23.030> way<00:02:23.209> to<00:02:23.240> go<00:02:23.540> to<00:02:23.990> avoid<00:02:24.290> him<00:02:24.500> so

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
this is a way to go to avoid him so

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:26.800 
this is a way to go to avoid him so
first<00:02:25.700> you're<00:02:25.760> going<00:02:25.880> to<00:02:25.970> go<00:02:26.090> up<00:02:26.300> on<00:02:26.480> the<00:02:26.510> back

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
first you're going to go up on the back

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.630 
first you're going to go up on the back
of<00:02:26.840> the<00:02:27.080> plane<00:02:27.350> you're<00:02:28.220> going<00:02:28.340> to<00:02:28.400> drop<00:02:28.580> down

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
of the plane you're going to drop down

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.280 
of the plane you're going to drop down
you're<00:02:29.180> going<00:02:29.300> to<00:02:29.390> go<00:02:29.480> through<00:02:29.720> the<00:02:29.900> middle

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
you're going to go through the middle

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.920 
you're going to go through the middle
you're<00:02:30.980> going<00:02:31.130> to<00:02:31.190> turn<00:02:31.340> right<00:02:31.690> sharp<00:02:32.690> right

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
you're going to turn right sharp right

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.250 
you're going to turn right sharp right
and<00:02:33.400> go<00:02:34.400> through<00:02:34.700> the<00:02:34.850> cave<00:02:35.090> turn<00:02:35.900> another

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
and go through the cave turn another

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.920 
and go through the cave turn another
sharp<00:02:36.650> right<00:02:36.860> now<00:02:37.130> go<00:02:37.790> around<00:02:38.120> this<00:02:38.300> area<00:02:38.540> go

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
sharp right now go around this area go

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.260 
sharp right now go around this area go
around<00:02:39.260> through<00:02:39.530> here<00:02:39.700> and<00:02:40.700> then<00:02:40.850> jump<00:02:41.120> off

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
around through here and then jump off

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.710 
around through here and then jump off
and<00:02:42.250> always<00:02:43.250> when<00:02:43.459> you<00:02:43.550> jump<00:02:43.850> start<00:02:44.330> sprinting

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
and always when you jump start sprinting

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.990 
and always when you jump start sprinting
again<00:02:45.110> while<00:02:45.410> you're<00:02:45.620> in<00:02:45.709> the<00:02:45.800> air<00:02:45.830> it's<00:02:46.730> a<00:02:46.850> lot

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
again while you're in the air it's a lot

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.420 
again while you're in the air it's a lot
easier<00:02:47.060> to<00:02:47.480> do<00:02:47.830> anyway<00:02:48.830> continue<00:02:49.280> going

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
easier to do anyway continue going

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.100 
easier to do anyway continue going
through<00:02:49.850> the<00:02:49.940> cave<00:02:50.120> you<00:02:50.300> might<00:02:50.450> have<00:02:50.600> lost<00:02:50.810> him

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
through the cave you might have lost him

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.660 
through the cave you might have lost him
or<00:02:51.290> if<00:02:51.680> you<00:02:51.800> haven't<00:02:52.190> it<00:02:52.280> you'll<00:02:52.489> at<00:02:52.610> least

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
or if you haven't it you'll at least

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.100 
or if you haven't it you'll at least
have<00:02:52.850> a<00:02:52.970> little<00:02:53.120> bit<00:02:53.330> of<00:02:53.360> an<00:02:53.480> edge<00:02:53.600> on<00:02:53.750> him<00:02:53.930> and

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
have a little bit of an edge on him and

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.720 
have a little bit of an edge on him and
that<00:02:54.140> edge<00:02:54.800> will<00:02:55.040> give<00:02:55.160> you<00:02:55.250> enough<00:02:55.489> time<00:02:55.519> to

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:55.730 
that edge will give you enough time to

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.390 
that edge will give you enough time to
go<00:02:56.090> up<00:02:57.019> like<00:02:57.320> this<00:02:57.560> and<00:02:57.800> this<00:02:58.010> is<00:02:58.070> a<00:02:58.220> little

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
go up like this and this is a little

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.949 
go up like this and this is a little
trick<00:02:58.640> you<00:02:58.760> have<00:02:58.880> to<00:02:58.970> jump<00:02:59.150> but<00:02:59.330> not<00:02:59.600> get<00:02:59.810> on

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
trick you have to jump but not get on

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:01.990 
trick you have to jump but not get on
lists<00:03:00.620> and<00:03:00.769> land<00:03:01.070> on<00:03:01.250> the<00:03:01.370> mattresses<00:03:01.760> down
