00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.410
 this manga 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.259
 the principle is simple in every 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.570
 episode I will present an animated or a 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.609
 manga in alphabetical order and 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.710
 today it's the letter aa like 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.930
 animal gus and if you understood other 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.670
 thing buddy is that you're a little 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.070
 Wholesale perverse night and I will

 and will present it to the vat excited 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.140
 sports talk about to maggie bryant park 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.910
 first of all what are we talking about we are going to 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.940
 find with nice and a high school student 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.900
 confident charismatic and a little imbued with 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.880
 his own person 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.640
 why he is not too 

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.500
 amazed when in the same early gives him 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.640
 a small rank because the problem is that for 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.440
 their rendezvous she takes him to a 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.000
 amusement park that is only the shadow 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.070
 of himself canes and will then 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.450
 shorten their appointment and this shot is 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.220
 quickly except that they play will him 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.920
 take out a fucking guns and tell him 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.630
 you are not very nice all that is going 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.250
 so quickly explain to him what is 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.020
 pass the amusement park is actually 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.000
 managed by magical creatures that have 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.840
 need to have visitors for that 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.570
 brings them happiness 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.979
 otherwise he dies in short not very cool all 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.150
 that's like your girlfriend leaving you 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.770
 because you're not happy 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.930
 except that's the case I'm sorry my 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.580
 buddy was going to please my neck gisele is 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.950
 there to comfort you what is not 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.630
 who is gisÃ¨le matam right finally good 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.460
 let's go back to our sheep or rather our 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.509
 winning attractions being endowed with a very 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.979
 good intelligence quotient 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.110
 it's not by chance that they play 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.910
 chose them and we will propose him the 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.920
 director position story to catch up 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.869
 the blow not very hot at the beginning cani 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.150
 will eventually accept and will rise to the challenge 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.880
 and we'll follow him for twelve episodes 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.100
 well already there we have various good elements 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.290
 we have a good original script 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.090
 who is not seen and seen with a 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.979
 good plot that will hold us in 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.390
 breath for twelve episodes because we 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.940
 will ask whether or not it 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.920
 will rise to the challenge and hold the 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.420
 bet to re-float the park and 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.799
 which way he intends to go about it 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.780
 since he is supposed to bring back 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.280
 two hundred and fifty thousand people in 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.630
 very little time which is huge 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.100
 it must be said the level of 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.420
 main characters we have the 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.070
 character of cagnes and he's pretty 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.570
 funny since it's a goal its own 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.920
 person and arrogant as I said 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.540
 just now but it's still 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.820
 attentive which makes anyway 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.060
 him a character quite endearing to my 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.190
 eyes 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.110
 as for the character saying where we 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.450
 there a girl a little awkward and with 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.000
 words and who often uses his 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.709
 gun to threaten but over 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.480
 episodes she will evolve and learn to 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.160
 better communicate with others one 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.590
 evolution of the interesting character 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.209
 but that will bring the only downside of the manga 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.070
 for me but I'll come back to it later 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.600
 otherwise we have the little mascot clique 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.019
 who are pretty funny each to their 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.700
 way 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.959
 we have a nice fire I'm not like we 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.940
 said but hey it does not matter who is a 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.470
 little bit angry and that makes a little 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.390
 complex with sagna 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.250
 we also have macaroons and always friend shot 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.500
 busy doing the 400 moves and 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.720
 tyrannical who is a little bit perverse 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.760
 which is funny enough if not another point 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.530
 positive of course it's the quality 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.390
 audio and visual we have beautiful graphics 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.090
 very colorful with good music 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.100
 as well as a nice opening and ending 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.720
 in short, there emerges an atmosphere quite 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.550
 happy and guay it feels like 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.080
 a bit of a disney without a boring side 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.910
 with the songs besides that there are 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.230
 boobs what better frankly of 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.160
 this concern with this year but as I 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.670
 say it is the evolution of 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.260
 characters 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.600
 because who says evolution of the characters 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.459
 said organ evolution ration between them 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.850
 and this end of season left me on my 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.860
 hunger 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.480
 I wanted them to have more of a sudden ben 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.490
 I'm waiting for a second season 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.260
 adjust this only negative side to my eyes 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.000
 and I hope she will not wait too long 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.280
 in any case it's a very good friend but 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.480
 certainly not the bustling of the century he did not 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.200
 the best stories even if she 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.060
 is original 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.400
 it will not make you bend in four or 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.810
 cry of sadness but it remains all 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.580
 likewise a very good friend but for me 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:46.080
 nevertheless i think i can assure you 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.120
 that you will have a good time 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.160
 in front of this animated and that it deserves the blow 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.570
 to be seen if I will not introduce in 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.580
 anyway it's a little animated use 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.260
 episode it is consumed quickly enough and if you 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.239
 still not convinced I put you 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.100
 this image like that there you are convinced 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:00.690
 that's all for this first episode 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.739
 of a letter to my guy were the 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.739
 next wave of people
