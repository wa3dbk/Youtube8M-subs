00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.350
 hello here is your michael from the bio 

00:00:02.459 --> 00:00:07.160
 cook today you make with lettuce 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.160
 to sprinkle nuts 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:26.550
 I have to post ten years and say 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:31.860
 parsley onions for pressing 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:34.379
 garlic squeezes mustard oil bit sweet 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:38.580
 less gave 68 or sugar salt 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:42.860
 Pepper apple really does not have an apple and 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.860
 I've also been useful with it 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:57.600
 the tab with the apple and turn 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:00.379
 cut out between German is the 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.379
 flag on approaching 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.080
 nice or not nice is a bit 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:11.170
 a matter of taste 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:14.190
 the sinner is the one with that 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:17.560
 crisp fresh me that sounds right 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:22.869
 That 's really easy to say 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:25.470
 German columns rise about 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.470
 give his case 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:50.400
 then we continue with the pressing yes 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:02:00.350
 even saying something could and does 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:02:00.350
 apple vinegar simply fun with it 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.840
 slowly flow in the beautiful 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.840
 illusion 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:20.769
 they would do with whisk 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.769
 but even smoother 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:33.400
 Apple should move to the fourth 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:33.400
 platz reaches only half 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:58.220
 bulk betting 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:03:00.530
 three.to herbs like parsley 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:04.180
 that will be a very fine lapidary like that 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:07.960
 best to link 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.960
 then it just gets tilted 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:17.690
 there you do not have to mark like broadcom 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:23.140
 today better-off because of the 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:25.520
 simply better that way you simplify drinking 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:29.330
 Formerly a cookery were and with 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:33.460
 the book volksbanken again - from apple 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.460
 get the roadway secure 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:41.770
 then I also here come the 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.770
 nuts into the to move with 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:54.829
 we have a really nice one 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:54.829
 Pull Christmassy Europe-wide 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.560
 give lessing 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:20.479
 for the pepper over it more than next to it 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.050
 cause 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:57.090
 always prefer an odd number 

00:04:52.819 --> 00:05:03.020
 So that's the name of the debate 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:03.020
 my back does not look nice from the 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:13.259
 Minister about this character still know 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:18.050
