even give you a legendary pack which was

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.410 
even give you a legendary pack which was
pretty<00:00:30.900> weird<00:00:31.260> so<00:00:31.590> I<00:00:31.859> think<00:00:32.340> I<00:00:32.730> kind<00:00:33.000> of<00:00:33.120> almost

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
pretty weird so I think I kind of almost

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.139 
pretty weird so I think I kind of almost
suspect<00:00:33.750> like<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.309> jersey<00:00:35.309> collection<00:00:35.910> coming

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
suspect like a jersey collection coming

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.990 
suspect like a jersey collection coming
up<00:00:36.420> for<00:00:37.380> all<00:00:37.469> these<00:00:37.770> team<00:00:38.340> of<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.489> weeks<00:00:38.700> maybe

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
up for all these team of the weeks maybe

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.600 
up for all these team of the weeks maybe

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
I don't know how long they're gonna keep

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.100 
I don't know how long they're gonna keep
on<00:00:41.760> doing<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.059> team<00:00:42.210> in<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.420> week<00:00:42.570> but<00:00:42.600> I

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
on doing the team in the week but I

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.610 
on doing the team in the week but I
don't<00:00:43.530> know<00:00:43.649> but<00:00:44.460> um<00:00:44.640> also<00:00:45.450> last<00:00:46.020> weekend<00:00:46.500> they

didn't<00:00:46.860> have<00:00:47.010> no<00:00:47.250> golden<00:00:47.670> ticket<00:00:48.059> so<00:00:48.620> I'm

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
didn't have no golden ticket so I'm

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.560 
didn't have no golden ticket so I'm
actually<00:00:49.980> hoping<00:00:50.460> for<00:00:50.789> some<00:00:50.910> golden<00:00:51.270> tickets

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570

actually hoping for some golden tickets
this<00:00:51.690> weekend<00:00:52.110> with<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.100> really<00:00:53.550> good

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
this weekend with a really good

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.290 
this weekend with a really good
positional<00:00:55.110> collection<00:00:55.680> i<00:00:55.949> was<00:00:56.820> thinking

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
positional collection i was thinking

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.319 
positional collection i was thinking
more<00:00:57.329> like<00:00:58.250> if<00:00:59.250> there's<00:00:59.640> going<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.879> be<00:00:59.910> a<00:01:00.000> free

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
more like if there's going to be a free

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:06.260 
more like if there's going to be a free
safety<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:01.760> right<00:01:02.760> end<00:01:03.680> um<00:01:04.729> running<00:01:05.729> back<00:01:05.939> or<00:01:05.970> a

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
safety a right end um running back or a

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.030 
safety a right end um running back or a
quarterback<00:01:06.750> if<00:01:07.020> it's<00:01:07.590> any<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:07.890> those

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
quarterback if it's any of those

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.609 
quarterback if it's any of those
collections<00:01:08.460> plus<00:01:09.360> golden<00:01:10.049> tickets<00:01:10.409> i

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
collections plus golden tickets i

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.920 
collections plus golden tickets i
probably<00:01:11.520> will<00:01:11.790> go<00:01:12.030> broke<00:01:12.650> so<00:01:13.650> i<00:01:14.299> think<00:01:15.299> i<00:01:15.900> just
