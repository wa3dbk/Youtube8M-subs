00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.950
 last of the report we got yesterday 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.660
 again, a lot of great legendary 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:12.769
 found and I want you once 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:16.529
 Show it starts with a blue 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:19.410
 2327 dps a socket then the effect 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.109
 on it and in addition has the thing 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.779
 then yes or one 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.189
 can also be intact here by now 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.230
 for example, the increased attack 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.349
 speed on it, you grab yourself 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.630
 not so bad, so really cool 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:38.280
 The second thing was another before 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.899
 weapon with 2326 dps already devalued 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.300
 Attack speed is on it one 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.180
 could live here now per hit 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:47.039
 have to go down and see if 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.450
 It's worth it if you can 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.190
 the life pro hit he already quite good 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.420
 Of course you could also be given if 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.370
 the attack speed here 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.770
 company and then a socket too 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:00.230
 then I pack my dumas 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.230
 cut found better 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.660
 the match is a bit too people in the 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.580
 compared to the weapons I already have 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:10.710
 did the damage just a little too low 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:14.490
 I can go on this shield I have 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:18.570
 this tree the pillows get real 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:21.480
 hammer horny shield with 29 blockade 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.520
 13,000 to 17,000 damage is blocked 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.780
 resistance drauflos the stronger on 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.580
 blogs already something on it so ever 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.160
 really cool shield if I the 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.070
 The cruiser should start hammering 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:34.770
 and the effect yes suffers 56 percent 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:40.590
 less damage from blocked attacks 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:42.960
 cool thing yes then I have the 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.350
 I did not think that 's mine though 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.259
 I found it exactly with cold 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.350
 crafts with intelligence drauflos 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.320
 and critical chance to hit you 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.400
 really nice if somehow a 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.170
 Character he plays on cold ability 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.420
 Clearly you can do that, however 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.619
 to change 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.860
 for example, the cold crafts often 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:07.410
 poison or something else then do 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.649
 a helmet with 704 and you have the max 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:12.510
 I still wanted to show rolls 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.550
 So you reduce the uplinks time 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.510
 knows the helmet is now just 70 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.340
 which has already rolled better 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.130
 then a two-hand watch I two years 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.020
 this is not great with 978 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.790
 intelligence and in 1904 that will be 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.140
 good of course, but of course that is 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.459
 just hurt too little 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.010
 the two and threw them should already 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.170
 I am at least 3000 injured 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.930
 the opinion with you then create 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:41.220
 others noticed and then one-handed 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:44.880
 after all damage a ring gets 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:48.330
 found living at 452 in twelve percent 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.100
 then regenerates regenerated 1886 live 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.910
 per second reduces the uplinks betrays 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:57.390
 all crafts around 6% germana it still 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.520
 on it and healing potions become 28 1696 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.900
 Life 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.420
 Now I have little here 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.550
 I got a gift because of ours 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:10.500
 Player does not need to 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:13.069
 skill 2 452 481 vitality 383 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.420
 Armor 16 percent lures a chance 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:17.040
 60 percent lures chance it is even max 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:21.500
 ball so here are the values not all 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:24.750
 top rolled and yes, of course, firstly 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:27.510
 is of course a hammer gerwing for the 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.890
 tanks there so you can really 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.299
 the techno deliver killed enemies 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.159
 grant more experience one could 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:34.579
 roll away and then some more 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:37.140
 other additional effect 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:39.780
 continue on the bed with 746 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.639
 intelligence 7% different speed 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.079
 the fragrance of the time that knows that too 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:45.329
 just better starts again 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:47.579
 but not really like it is here now 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:52.859
 is so need then I finally have 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:55.549
 found camille by countess julia okay 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:58.109
 my phone rings we will do the same 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:04:01.829
 659 intelligence attack speed 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:04.919
 increased by five percent regenerates 2452 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:07.639
 live per second and ignored 

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:09.720
 harm all incoming akan 

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:14.129
 ignores all incoming 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:19.829
 arcanum and heal you by 2 22 percent 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:22.260
 the ignored crowd then it works 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:26.849
 continue with one so that's great here 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:28.740
 super cool for macs with laser beams 

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:30.060
 Just put it in that you can do it too 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.919
 cloudy and if you then pack 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.750
 then you just have it in and then 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:37.470
 you can no longer there because the readers 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:40.050
 then breast die with fire 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.550
 skills in critical hit chance 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.639
 you could live here now per hit 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.190
 still go away and then through 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:49.889
 Replace Critical Hit Damage 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.479
 whoever comes to days like that so now 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:55.979
 highlights from yesterday I found 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:57.030
 I have the highlight 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:59.220
 believe the breast I had already in 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.960
 last report shown exactly if you 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.820
 all have less than 20 lives 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.699
 attacks guaranteed critical hits 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:09.030
 but what I found is still here 

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:15.930
 the gladiator armor gloves with 701 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:17.610
 in 750, max 729 vitality is 42 percent 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.349
 critical strike damage and ten 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.270
 Of course, percent of Christians are the 

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:23.590
 additional effects four more 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.990
 pickup radius and after you enter 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:29.020
 saka bonus received regulates the gold 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:30.520
 from the sky so the thing really great 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:31.990
 Hammer stats if you think so 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.300
 old gloves i look at 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:36.070
 I still have it lying around somewhere 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:39.790
 that's my old okay to do that 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:41.320
 Although a bit more damage but because of it 

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:42.970
 but the attack speed stops 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.770
 Of course we bring the new ones for that 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:47.110
 Gloves simply 21 percent more 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.730
 Toughness and now with mine 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.970
 complete greed as I am here now 

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:53.770
 I already have 457,000 lives 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:56.140
 and have an ability of four 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:06:00.510
 millions and you can see paper dts 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:06:03.010
 now stands at 619 or 620,000 damage 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:04.930
 I'm doing about now when we're in 

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:08.050
 a group play ten to thirty 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:09.820
 million critical hits on the 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:12.880
 monsters 10 to 30 million 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:14.560
 skin purely topical we also play qual 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:19.350
 three quali also already loose 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:22.570
 possible so qual 34 we play currently 

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:25.870
 yes, there is also something to say actually 

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:27.730
 not that was the complete greed like that 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:30.430
 as of now you already know that 

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:32.890
 and yes, those were all the cool new ones 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:36.940
 objects the gladiator armor 

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:40.420
 gloves of the upper hammer you have to times 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:42.220
 say exactly the skin back into the 

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:43.240
 Comments show what's so fat 

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.380
 I would already have found myself 

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:46.900
 I'm interested in a few too 

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:50.820
 never found masters because there 

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:50.820
 I'm also looking for a lot 

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:55.350
 but I found something else 

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:57.340
 I forgot these demons 

00:06:55.350 --> 00:07:00.420
 Leather gloves on seemed like this new one 

00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:03.100
 So I found a plan for the moon 

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:05.350
 and of course already 

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:06.040
 a few legendary hefty items here 

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:11.020
 these 

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:12.880
 woods near plock venture of death because 

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:14.920
 you need now for the whole 

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:16.660
 new forces are endless 

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:18.490
 apps so much many items I too 

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:19.960
 cool because you have it 

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:22.510
 of course in the game what to do and you 

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:25.450
 does not always have everything so one 

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:26.770
 cool thing okay that's it from me 

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:28.210
 been that before the last of the 

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:29.620
 report for today I hope he has you 

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:29.890
 please if yes gives me a thumb 

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:31.900
 high 

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:35.280
 See you on a live stream up 

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:35.280
 then your margin looks
