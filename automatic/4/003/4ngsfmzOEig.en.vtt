00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.550
 hello everyone be that you go 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:04.290
 well today I am a small 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.700
 video paul or bottle so for the 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.960
 guinea pig so I quote there is 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.580
 many people who have already done 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.559
 this video but I really wanted to 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.240
 to say my point of view on that so I 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.179
 started by talking about the bottle has 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:21.000
 really of all shapes every 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:23.630
 attachment forms all here so that's it 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.269
 it's used for serious bottles and 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:30.179
 so do not see how the task is 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:31.740
 so it's set like that so at the 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.960
 bar yesterday so that's the same fear of 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.160
 dishes just put to show you 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.079
 water with vitamin c 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.640
 although I know that I love here 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.190
 degrades in water or a message for 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.250
 So you come back there like that it's for 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.800
 the walls so that it clings 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:52.379
 and suckers and so here we are 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:55.350
 little bounce translated as well I'm here 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.750
 had dropped it so I thought by 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.899
 the benefits of living so as any 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.840
 we know all the likely world water 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:07.290
 do not dirty in a bottle 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:09.780
 but so here is a flow do not dirty 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.100
 not a bottle and 2 I would say that he 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.170
 there is really room to put a 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.320
 baby bottle pascual to a bowl that to take 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.630
 the whole place in the bottle cage 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.520
 it's just hanging like that at the cage 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.470
 so that limit is approaching his com 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.180
 place it's all the time it's for the 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.830
 benefits but good for me there is no 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.350
 else then the disadvantages 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.210
 now so the crazy pig is 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.630
 not natural for him to come to drink at 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.369
 baby bottle 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.750
 he's doing a lot of work for just 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.170
 have every time a little drop 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.189
 water 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.290
 so he has to make a lot of effort 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:42.390
 then for example this short but good there 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.950
 I find it misleading because 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.399
 that he is super tall so people are going 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.560
 fill to the brim and it's better 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.659
 change that as soon as it is finished then 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.759
 that a bottle iflow must be changed 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.710
 every day but really every 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.509
 days it's not good for the pig 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.880
 of India to have water that remained 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.280
 like that my good friend so long 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.740
 here we must really change everything 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.340
 you have to lose the bottle it's just ip 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.560
 complicated art of cleaning it well 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.380
 really with his hyper galley of the with 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.560
 a big all the inside and the list 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.120
 party and she went inside 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.220
 and everything is just hyper galley to 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.360
 clean up so there are people who are going 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.920
 to drop they will not clean them up 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.099
 it's going to be room for the crazy pig 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.989
 so bad for him 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:29.060
 good for the benefits and the 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:31.230
 cons 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.670
 I wanted to reiterate and benefits 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.840
 disadvantages if it comes back to me 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.599
 the mind during the video 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.459
 so now I'm doing his flight peeled 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:40.799
 bowl is really full of 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:44.190
 different materials and all so there he 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:45.720
 there is for example a bowl I do not know too much 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.540
 what is the material in fact I use 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.120
 not for my guinea pigs I say for 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.799
 villain must put water but 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.780
 I do not know I know it's not 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:57.239
 plastic or varnish of stainless steel but 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.030
 can we ceramic or I do not know where 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.470
 alain bolle like that so the them 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.930
 disadvantages of these words there is that 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:07.470
 that's really it already takes place and 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:11.579
 it's going my lot is going to get dirty all the time 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:14.660
 so here are some plastic bowls so that's 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:17.280
 so already plastic as it is light 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:20.370
 the var columns spilled the bowl 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:25.140
 so this is going to mess up local indoor s 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:27.390
 also learns that the place so me 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.769
 what I use as a flight and what is 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.769
 I find a month to be the best tomorrow 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.910
 paul like that in stainless steel that cling 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:35.400
 at the bars of the cage 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:38.130
 so all that already takes a lot 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:41.850
 less space than it is beautiful here it is 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:45.180
 it's nice little it does not spill 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.989
 it's easy to clean the covenant 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.150
 do not dirty it 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:50.150
 in any case mine do not dirty 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:54.510
 so natural for leftily to drink to 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:56.519
 inside when he owes his middle 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.840
 natural will not drink in a big one va 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:00.760
 see like that 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.879
 so really really great these 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.470
 flights so do not spill it 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:07.480
 hang on to the bar and then the wood like 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.780
 that's a doc that's good con pigs 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.060
 turkey 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.879
 it's not toxic or anything so I find 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.800
 that's really great ceibal so has already 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:16.299
 I still prefer bowls to 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.370
 bottle that I find the bottles I 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.560
 find it really not good my pigs 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.410
 besides, I already have in fact tested 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.300
 the bottle with my friends and they do not 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.220
 do not drink there do not drink I saw 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.960
 that I left 6 to a whole day the 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.150
 level did not go down at all no 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.830
 really it's often because they are 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:33.639
 not used to it but I think he does not like 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.600
 not the bottle 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:38.919
 we much prefer that so here I am 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.320
 advise you the stainless steel bowl that 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:44.320
 cling to the bar finally it's 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:47.860
 really great i find like bob so 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.720
 these are the disadvantages 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.669
 I do not sell it so it's true 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.990
 that it 's more likely to read than a bios 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:54.010
 bridge but me they do not dirty it 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:56.050
 but I think there are still some 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:58.960
 pigs that will emit their feces 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.550
 of in things like that but that's it 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.410
 otherwise I will not see too many disadvantages 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.060
 it takes a little space compared to 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:05.710
 baby bottle 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.930
 but here I find it much better 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.760
 that I really recommend this flight there so 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:13.419
 whether for water or for 15000 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:16.419
 and besides, here is your bac here 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:21.729
 I have everything but all my boli baby bottle 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:24.310
 spare in this bin there we see where when 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:25.930
 we go on vacation we put full 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.880
 of extracts of eads in so that the 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.060
 layers world can have when we 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.919
 go 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.470
 finally when we go on vacation we have our 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:33.940
 neighbors who feeds them and when we leave 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.590
 weekend in the gorge not for that 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.360
 so we have but a lot 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:40.060
 in there that problem is that like 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:44.320
 friendly he ranks the ladies we go 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:47.680
 Avoiding flight so here I hope that 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:49.060
 this video pleased you do not hesitate to 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.000
 tell me how are you if you prefer 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:54.280
 the bottle-feeding bowl is here even if you have 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.229
 questions asked the months I go there 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:57.810
 will really answer that if I can I 

00:05:56.229 --> 00:05:59.220
 would you answer if you do not want me direct 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:02.730
 I can not answer you anyway 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:06.780
 So here I really prefer it here 

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:08.580
 that's really you it's really not 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:11.730
 well after if you change your if 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:14.100
 your pig and drink or bottle that that 

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:17.220
 does not bother you change well 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:19.050
 water every day why not but 

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:22.740
 well here I prefer the bowl anyway 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:24.840
 I recommend the bowl because that's it 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:27.660
 in addition to the baby bottle here I think I 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.919
 did not say very generally they 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:31.800
 taste and so suddenly it makes a 

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:32.729
 wet spot under bottle so I 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:36.479
 really not practical 

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:37.050
 while with litter saab remains 

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:39.900
 dried 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:41.310
 they will not ally the bottle very 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:43.470
 often he will taste 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:44.910
 so it's really not practical and then 

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:46.830
 it's going to wet the cost of the guinea pig 

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:49.050
 by tasting on his head if he goes into 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:51.090
 underneath samri his head we know it's 

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:53.520
 when they drink they get wet a little 

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:55.889
 the shot but I know that after he 

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.710
 wipes and all and it's not you 

00:06:55.889 --> 00:07:00.030
 novels so here I really hope that 

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:03.660
 you enjoyed this video in this video 

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:05.130
 is over so do not hesitate to 

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:10.610
 tell me ideas of videos in 

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:10.610
 comment and that's kisses
