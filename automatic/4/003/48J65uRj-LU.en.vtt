with Buddhist practitioners who are

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.639 
with Buddhist practitioners who are
focusing<00:01:51.689> on<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.930> nature<00:01:52.079> of<00:01:52.320> pure

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
focusing on the nature of pure

focusing on the nature of pure

consciousness

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.270 
consciousness
and<00:01:54.420> this<00:01:55.420> put<00:01:55.900> his<00:01:56.200> research<00:01:56.740> on<00:01:56.920> the<00:01:57.010> cover

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
and this put his research on the cover

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.850 
and this put his research on the cover
of<00:01:57.370> Newsweek<00:01:58.030> then<00:01:58.690> he<00:01:58.870> does<00:01:59.050> study<00:01:59.530> with

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
of Newsweek then he does study with

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.520 
of Newsweek then he does study with
Franciscan<00:02:00.610> nuns<00:02:00.640> and<00:02:01.330> they<00:02:01.720> were<00:02:01.840> focusing

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
Franciscan nuns and they were focusing

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.820 
Franciscan nuns and they were focusing
on<00:02:03.060> feeling<00:02:04.060> closer<00:02:04.330> to<00:02:04.660> God<00:02:04.900> and<00:02:05.680> the

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
on feeling closer to God and the

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.310 
on feeling closer to God and the
remarkable<00:02:06.400> thing<00:02:06.790> about<00:02:06.820> the<00:02:07.270> study<00:02:07.540> is<00:02:07.810> that

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 
remarkable thing about the study is that

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.060 
remarkable thing about the study is that
we<00:02:08.470> saw<00:02:08.679> the<00:02:08.740> same<00:02:09.149> neurological<00:02:11.070> processes

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
we saw the same neurological processes

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.090 
we saw the same neurological processes
going<00:02:12.459> on<00:02:12.790> so<00:02:13.450> it<00:02:13.600> turns<00:02:13.959> out<00:02:14.170> it's<00:02:14.440> not<00:02:14.770> about

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
going on so it turns out it's not about

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.810 
going on so it turns out it's not about
the<00:02:15.550> religions<00:02:16.200> it's<00:02:17.200> about<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:18.160> depth<00:02:18.580> of

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
the religions it's about the depth of

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.960 
the religions it's about the depth of
the<00:02:19.360> belief<00:02:19.810> itself<00:02:20.260> if<00:02:20.650> we<00:02:20.860> focus<00:02:21.430> on<00:02:21.940> a

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
the belief itself if we focus on a

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.080 
the belief itself if we focus on a
sacred<00:02:22.480> belief<00:02:22.840> or<00:02:23.140> a<00:02:23.170> sacred<00:02:23.709> word<00:02:23.950> or<00:02:24.370> for<00:02:25.060> a

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
sacred belief or a sacred word or for a

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.600 
sacred belief or a sacred word or for a
secular<00:02:25.540> level<00:02:26.020> something<00:02:26.920> that<00:02:27.070> is<00:02:27.160> deeply

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
secular level something that is deeply

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.760 
secular level something that is deeply
meaningful<00:02:27.790> to<00:02:28.300> your<00:02:28.420> life<00:02:28.690> and<00:02:29.050> you<00:02:29.530> keep
