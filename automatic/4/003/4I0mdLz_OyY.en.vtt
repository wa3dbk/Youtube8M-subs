watched too many anti acid commercials
there<00:00:33.270> is<00:00:33.480> there's<00:00:33.899> just<00:00:34.200> not<00:00:34.380> normally<00:00:35.100> a

that's only old TV commercials I've done
hundreds<00:00:42.750> of<00:00:42.870> gastrous<00:00:43.379> copes<00:00:43.680> where<00:00:44.010> you

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
hundreds of gastrous copes where you

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.830 
hundreds of gastrous copes where you
take<00:00:44.489> a<00:00:44.520> scope<00:00:44.910> down<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.329> stomach<00:00:45.719> and

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
take a scope down to the stomach and

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.560 
take a scope down to the stomach and
examine<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.530> stomach<00:00:46.969> and<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.120> stomach<00:00:48.180> is

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
examine the stomach and the stomach is

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.010 
examine the stomach and the stomach is
normally<00:00:49.110> empty<00:00:49.500> so<00:00:50.460> when<00:00:51.329> you<00:00:51.480> drink<00:00:51.750> alcohol

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
normally empty so when you drink alcohol

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.470 
normally empty so when you drink alcohol
autre<00:00:52.559> it<00:00:52.890> simply<00:00:53.399> goes<00:00:53.699> in<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:53.940> stomach<00:00:54.300> and

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
autre it simply goes in the stomach and

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.360 
autre it simply goes in the stomach and
passes<00:00:54.989> on<00:00:55.110> through<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.829> small<00:00:56.129> bowel

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
passes on through to the small bowel

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.180 
passes on through to the small bowel
where<00:00:56.699> it's<00:00:56.820> absorbed<00:00:57.410> now<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.829> mucous

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
where it's absorbed now the the mucous

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.990 
where it's absorbed now the the mucous
lining<00:00:59.460> of<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.910> stomach<00:00:59.969> is<00:01:00.800> acid<00:01:01.800> but<00:01:02.100> if<00:01:02.850> you

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
lining of the stomach is acid but if you

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.429 
lining of the stomach is acid but if you
understand<00:01:03.480> there's<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.750> lot<00:01:04.019> of<00:01:04.140> villi

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
understand there's a lot of villi

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.990 
understand there's a lot of villi
there's<00:01:04.830> these<00:01:04.979> little<00:01:05.159> fingers<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:05.909> the

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
there's these little fingers and the

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.770 
there's these little fingers and the
mucus<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:07.040> acid<00:01:08.040> is<00:01:08.159> down<00:01:08.369> in<00:01:08.700> there<00:01:08.939> so<00:01:09.270> the

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
mucus and acid is down in there so the

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.080 
mucus and acid is down in there so the
liquid<00:01:10.200> doesn't<00:01:10.590> disturb<00:01:11.130> that<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.520> just<00:01:11.729> runs

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
liquid doesn't disturb that it just runs

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.690 
liquid doesn't disturb that it just runs
over<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.450> stomach<00:01:12.750> wall<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.350> right<00:01:14.310> on<00:01:14.520> into

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
over the stomach wall and right on into

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.649 
over the stomach wall and right on into
the<00:01:14.909> small<00:01:15.180> bowel<00:01:16.009> so<00:01:17.009> this<00:01:17.400> is<00:01:17.580> not<00:01:17.759> an<00:01:18.000> issue

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
the small bowel so this is not an issue

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.280 
the small bowel so this is not an issue
you<00:01:19.170> know<00:01:19.860> but<00:01:20.159> but<00:01:20.549> even<00:01:21.000> if<00:01:21.270> even<00:01:22.049> if<00:01:22.140> there

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
you know but but even if even if there

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.010 
you know but but even if even if there
were<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.950> pool<00:01:23.850> of<00:01:24.060> acid<00:01:24.479> you<00:01:24.570> know<00:01:24.659> let's<00:01:24.960> say

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
were a pool of acid you know let's say

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.660 
were a pool of acid you know let's say
you<00:01:25.110> had<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.320> really<00:01:25.619> bad<00:01:26.009> day<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.310> really

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
you had a really bad day a really

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.880 
you had a really bad day a really
stressful<00:01:26.970> day<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.869> there<00:01:28.290> is<00:01:28.320> this<00:01:28.590> little

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
stressful day and there is this little

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.190 
stressful day and there is this little
bit<00:01:28.979> of<00:01:29.040> liquid<00:01:29.610> acid<00:01:30.090> in<00:01:30.180> your<00:01:30.210> stomach<00:01:30.360> and

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
bit of liquid acid in your stomach and

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.469 
bit of liquid acid in your stomach and
you<00:01:31.530> drink<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.920> little<00:01:31.979> water<00:01:32.280> well<00:01:33.000> yes<00:01:33.240> it

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
you drink a little water well yes it

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.800 
you drink a little water well yes it
would<00:01:33.570> neutralize<00:01:33.750> that<00:01:34.409> but<00:01:35.479> that<00:01:36.479> is<00:01:36.659> still

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
would neutralize that but that is still

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.990 
would neutralize that but that is still
a<00:01:36.960> net<00:01:37.380> alkaline<00:01:38.130> event<00:01:38.460> for<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.759> body

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
a net alkaline event for the body

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.560 
a net alkaline event for the body
because<00:01:39.450> when<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:39.900> made<00:01:40.200> that<00:01:40.229> acid<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.880> had<00:01:42.390> to

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
because when it made that acid it had to

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.700 
because when it made that acid it had to
make<00:01:42.780> alkaline

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
make alkaline

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.609 
make alkaline
you<00:01:43.979> can't<00:01:44.369> just<00:01:44.549> make<00:01:44.700> acid<00:01:45.450> out<00:01:45.630> of<00:01:45.720> thin<00:01:46.140> air

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
you can't just make acid out of thin air

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.700 
you can't just make acid out of thin air
you<00:01:46.950> have<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.430> divide<00:01:48.270> two<00:01:48.750> organic

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
you have to divide two organic

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.710 
you have to divide two organic
substances<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.549> when<00:01:50.700> you<00:01:50.790> do<00:01:50.939> you<00:01:51.090> make<00:01:51.240> acid

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
substances and when you do you make acid

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.210 
substances and when you do you make acid
and<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:51.899> make<00:01:52.049> alkaline<00:01:52.590> just<00:01:52.860> like<00:01:53.009> though

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
and you make alkaline just like though

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.920 
and you make alkaline just like though
the<00:01:53.430> water<00:01:53.670> machines<00:01:54.030> make<00:01:54.270> an<00:01:54.420> acid<00:01:54.840> or

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
the water machines make an acid or

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.800 
the water machines make an acid or
stream<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.530> an<00:01:55.619> alkaline<00:01:56.040> stream<00:01:56.340> so<00:01:57.210> your

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810
