win<00:03:48.659> this<00:03:48.810> race<00:03:49.019> he's<00:03:49.290> a<00:03:49.319> major<00:03:49.590> player<00:03:49.949> but<00:03:50.459> I

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
win this race he's a major player but I

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.069 
win this race he's a major player but I
think<00:03:50.790> the<00:03:50.909> private<00:03:51.150> zone<00:03:51.479> gets<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:51.959> edge

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
think the private zone gets the edge

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:54.379 
think the private zone gets the edge
because<00:03:52.889> you<00:03:52.919> know<00:03:53.310> of<00:03:53.459> his<00:03:53.579> fees<00:03:53.790> gonna<00:03:54.060> clear

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:54.389 
because you know of his fees gonna clear

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:56.119 
because you know of his fees gonna clear
off<00:03:54.540> the<00:03:54.750> big<00:03:54.959> beast<00:03:55.169> has<00:03:55.470> to<00:03:55.620> make<00:03:55.799> his<00:03:55.979> own

race<00:04:11.489> I'm<00:04:11.759> highly<00:04:12.209> dubious<00:04:12.419> he's<00:04:12.780> gonna<00:04:12.900> run

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:13.139

race I'm highly dubious he's gonna run
well<00:04:13.319> in<00:04:13.349> here<00:04:13.709> but<00:04:14.129> I<00:04:14.159> think<00:04:14.250> he's<00:04:14.549> a<00:04:14.579> horse

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130
