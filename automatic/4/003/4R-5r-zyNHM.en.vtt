00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:07.680
cars dot com auto review Hi this is Joe Bruzek from cars.com

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.700
this is the Lamborghini Gallardo Superleggera now be fine yourself thinking

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.920
oh hey their regular Caro its two
hundred thousand dollars but not exotic

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:16.379
enough

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.020
well this is the answer superbly share
means

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.890
superlight and Larry primarily does that
and Aguero

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.080
through the use carbon fiber that carbon
fiber on the mir

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.169
down here and around back we've got this

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:35.680
unique fixed carbon fiber wing carbon
fiber

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.210
engine cover and Declan and carbon fiber
rear diffuser

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.399
that carbon fiber

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:46.280
lightweight trend carries around inside
door panels are carbon fiber

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.510
there's just a little strap here there's
no actual cryptogram onto

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.920
steering wheel dashboard Center counts
of

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.320
even the seats are lightweight rates and
fees may have a carbon fiber

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.050
this adjustability that's all they do
everything else suspect

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.780
in addition to my lightweight the
supervision era ads

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.290
10 more horsepower that's enough talking
school for a ride

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.560
there's no question and this

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.659
supercar that's not on the inside

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:19.650
it

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.040
pretty mommy delivering long

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.450
Scarlets there's no yeah

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.170
line

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.190
it doesn't matter I mean this thing
woohoo

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.350
ok

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.759
and super sure it is not likely chance

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:41.360
speeds when you first inning of its own
little clunky a little Chanderi

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.190
and when he sent a letter saying corner
problem just trying to get up

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.840
35-40 miles an hour into the lane
Shanahan just doesn't feel really

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:51.390
confident

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.990
love and energy business cards not
supposed to be chance

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.780
means the Superleggera commands a 35

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.039
thousand dollar premium over the regular
Airtel

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:07.300
to put it in perspective that's about
the cost of a g37 sedan

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.120
so what would you take the g37 sedan and
a regular Gerardo

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.269
or the Superleggera I'm I would miss
