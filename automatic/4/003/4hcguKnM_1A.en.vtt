00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
case itself which we'll get to in a

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.900 
case itself which we'll get to in a
second<00:00:36.660> there<00:00:37.440> is<00:00:37.559> an<00:00:37.680> installation<00:00:38.040> tool<00:00:38.640> as

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
second there is an installation tool as

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.030 
second there is an installation tool as
well<00:00:39.059> as<00:00:39.120> two<00:00:39.390> extra<00:00:39.750> screws<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.410> then<00:00:40.800> some

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
well as two extra screws and then some

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.799 
well as two extra screws and then some
instructions<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:41.879> that's<00:00:42.059> all<00:00:42.270> you<00:00:42.390> get<00:00:42.629> with

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
instructions and that's all you get with

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.959 
instructions and that's all you get with
this<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.200> really<00:00:43.829> that's<00:00:44.160> all<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.489> need<00:00:44.700> and

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
this and really that's all you need and

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.850 
this and really that's all you need and
I'm<00:00:45.030> gonna<00:00:45.149> show<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.420> why<00:00:45.690> so<00:00:46.110> this<00:00:46.710> is<00:00:46.829> a

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
I'm gonna show you why so this is a

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.889 
I'm gonna show you why so this is a
three<00:00:47.340> piece<00:00:47.670> case<00:00:48.000> essentially<00:00:48.539> you<00:00:48.750> have

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
three piece case essentially you have

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.680 
three piece case essentially you have
two<00:00:49.170> end<00:00:49.410> caps<00:00:49.739> that<00:00:50.399> are<00:00:50.460> made<00:00:50.700> from<00:00:50.969> cnc

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
two end caps that are made from cnc

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.380 
two end caps that are made from cnc
aluminum<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:52.440> then<00:00:52.860> you<00:00:52.980> have<00:00:53.190> a

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
aluminum and then you have a

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.380 
aluminum and then you have a
polycarbonate<00:00:54.390> soft-touch<00:00:54.930> backplate<00:00:55.649> so

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
polycarbonate soft-touch backplate so

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.180 
polycarbonate soft-touch backplate so
installation<00:00:57.390> involves<00:00:58.140> removing<00:00:58.620> all<00:00:58.800> four

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
installation involves removing all four

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.639 
installation involves removing all four
screws<00:00:59.520> and<00:01:00.180> popping<00:01:00.629> off<00:01:00.780> off<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.079> two

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
screws and popping off off the two

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.429 
screws and popping off off the two
crowns<00:01:02.280> they<00:01:02.670> call<00:01:02.879> them<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.239> then<00:01:03.750> treating

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
crowns they call them and then treating

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.500 
crowns they call them and then treating
this<00:01:04.619> back<00:01:05.159> portion<00:01:05.580> just<00:01:05.909> like<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.030> snap<00:01:06.330> on

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
this back portion just like a snap on

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.480 
this back portion just like a snap on
the<00:01:06.630> back<00:01:06.780> style<00:01:07.020> case<00:01:07.350> it's<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:08.070> little<00:01:08.400> bit

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
the back style case it's a little bit

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.130 
the back style case it's a little bit
flexible<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:09.090> your<00:01:09.180> phone<00:01:09.390> just<00:01:09.630> pops<00:01:09.900> right

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
flexible and your phone just pops right

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.350 
flexible and your phone just pops right
in<00:01:10.380> and<00:01:10.619> then<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.130> replace<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.880> back<00:01:12.060> caps

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
in and then you replace the back caps

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.090 
in and then you replace the back caps
and<00:01:12.600> screw<00:01:12.869> them<00:01:13.020> back<00:01:13.049> together

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
and screw them back together

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.539 
and screw them back together
so<00:01:14.580> it<00:01:15.570> does<00:01:15.720> have<00:01:15.930> a<00:01:15.990> super<00:01:16.710> cool<00:01:16.890> soft<00:01:17.310> touch

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
so it does have a super cool soft touch

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.190 
so it does have a super cool soft touch
finish<00:01:18.060> which<00:01:18.270> feels<00:01:18.509> great<00:01:18.840> in<00:01:19.020> your<00:01:19.049> hand

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
finish which feels great in your hand

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
finish which feels great in your hand

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
and i'm gonna install it onto my iphone

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.399 
and i'm gonna install it onto my iphone

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
in a flash

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.030 
in a flash
so<00:01:30.060> i've<00:01:30.210> got<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.540> case<00:01:30.810> fully<00:01:31.140> installed<00:01:31.680> on

so i've got the case fully installed on

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.580 
so i've got the case fully installed on
to<00:01:32.280> my<00:01:32.520> iphone<00:01:32.970> 5<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.600> installation<00:01:34.409> process

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
to my iphone 5 the installation process

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.200 
to my iphone 5 the installation process
is<00:01:34.920> a<00:01:35.009> bit<00:01:35.189> longer<00:01:35.400> than<00:01:35.520> some<00:01:35.670> of<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.060> other

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
is a bit longer than some of the other

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.819 
is a bit longer than some of the other

out<00:02:00.030> of<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.180> way<00:02:00.240> so<00:02:00.390> you<00:02:00.600> can<00:02:00.630> get<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.810> better

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
look at it so the back plate I mentioned

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.200 
look at it so the back plate I mentioned

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
a really nice gash when I was installing

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.930 
a really nice gash when I was installing
it<00:02:11.550> for<00:02:11.760> whatever<00:02:11.879> reason<00:02:12.360> I'm<00:02:12.480> not<00:02:12.540> sure<00:02:12.750> how

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
it for whatever reason I'm not sure how

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.970 
it for whatever reason I'm not sure how
I got<00:02:13.150> on<00:02:13.270> there<00:02:13.480> but<00:02:13.690> pretty<00:02:14.260> big<00:02:14.500> gasps<00:02:14.860> or

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
I got on there but pretty big gasps or

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.010 
I got on there but pretty big gasps or
this<00:02:15.100> will<00:02:15.310> scratch<00:02:15.610> since<00:02:16.240> it's<00:02:16.450> all<00:02:16.660> kind<00:02:16.960> of

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
this will scratch since it's all kind of

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.230 
this will scratch since it's all kind of
a<00:02:17.170> modular<00:02:17.380> though<00:02:17.830> in<00:02:17.980> design<00:02:18.280> I<00:02:18.640> imagine
