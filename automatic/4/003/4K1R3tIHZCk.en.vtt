00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:13.990
 ah 

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:16.630
 very good to all I am to him today 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.730
 I bring a curiosity a warning a 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.310
 comment on something that I found out makes 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:24.430
 very little and that truthfully I did not believe 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:27.100
 at the time but it's totally true 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.990
 how will you see what it is about 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:32.259
 it's about that when you pull the cable 

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:34.120
 repeatedly it 's treyarch you 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:37.450
 they will show on the servers of 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:40.570
 call of duty how much more less time 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.310
 time the beginning you will see me now 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:46.210
 he was organized 30 seconds or a minute 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:48.129
 that's that is increscendo nothing little of 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.440
 little by little when more recorded then more 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:53.170
 they had as they are seeing in 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.149
 screen I'm pulling variants of 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.149
 cable until I get that warning 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:01:01.629
 and in the end you should but what he said 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:04.989
 It's okay it's wrong because I do not have 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:06.910
 a clear position because to see me 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.340
 I think this would be fine if only 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:13.240
 they handled those who are the host of the 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.740
 starting and pulling the cable that seems to me 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.610
 quite correct because they fuck you 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:20.619
 starting but what I find wrong is that 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.990
 you pull the cable but sometimes and you 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:24.369
 They handle bad now because I think it 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.689
 you think he has the concert of the time 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:30.460
 he does not even cousin but the water was 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:32.259
 that I for example before when I had 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.390
 a fucking connection had a mega 3 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:37.450
 megas with the router is it takes super 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.430
 bad and I always shut up the games and 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.140
 when you fall the games also you 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.210
 tell how the cable will be pulled because 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.650
 me at the time of this one they turned off the 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.260
 router 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.610
 I fell out of the game or whatever and I 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.470
 I reappeared and I was two minutes and 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.630
 you can play 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.180
 at that time I am no longer in the period 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.330
 warning and nothing happens but I do not 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:01.900
 it seems completely correct here you see it 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:03.550
 Observation notice completed departures 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.170
 at all to avoid being in 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.940
 observation if you happen to be in 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.500
 observation you will not be able to play games 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.240
 public nor games of the game league 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.190
 for a time 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.010
 since it is because you do not have the 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.980
 cable 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.049
 Well, you will tell me your opinion 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.810
 curious at least I did not believe it but 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:24.450
 is to see is so you can have your points 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.610
 good your bad points but it's one thing 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.950
 of this new call of duty that does not 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.879
 always intrigues us with new things 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:35.819
 treyarch that always bathing and doing 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:38.310
 of yours but good is another 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.500
 thing more to keep in mind this has been 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.870
 everything if you thought it was curious if it has 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.430
 served something like dallas 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.129
 favorites but appeared is very 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:50.239
 funny how I saw and good subscribe if 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:50.239
