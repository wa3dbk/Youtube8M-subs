that<00:03:15.260> makes<00:03:15.470> sense<00:03:15.790> therefore<00:03:16.790> you<00:03:16.880> get<00:03:17.000> even

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
that makes sense therefore you get even

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.060 
that makes sense therefore you get even
coverage<00:03:17.480> over<00:03:17.840> across<00:03:18.049> the<00:03:18.260> hall<00:03:18.410> now<00:03:18.590> so

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
coverage over across the hall now so

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:20.860 
coverage over across the hall now so
these<00:03:19.190> polishes<00:03:19.610> are<00:03:19.700> self<00:03:19.970> leveling<00:03:20.420> so<00:03:20.720> that

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
these polishes are self leveling so that

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.800 
these polishes are self leveling so that
means<00:03:21.079> any<00:03:21.530> tiny<00:03:22.400> little<00:03:22.700> raised<00:03:23.120> parts<00:03:23.660> of

means any tiny little raised parts of

means any tiny little raised parts of
the<00:03:23.900> Polish<00:03:24.170> that<00:03:24.470> you<00:03:24.620> might<00:03:24.799> get<00:03:25.070> from<00:03:25.480> maybe

it<00:04:47.310> very<00:04:47.490> exciting<00:04:48.060> when<00:04:48.449> a<00:04:48.690> makeup<00:04:49.440> brand

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
it very exciting when a makeup brand

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.520 
it very exciting when a makeup brand
launches<00:04:50.129> nail<00:04:50.280> polishes<00:04:50.789> because<00:04:51.780> they<00:04:52.379> are

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
launches nail polishes because they are

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.320 
launches nail polishes because they are
they<00:04:52.680> get<00:04:52.800> it<00:04:52.919> super<00:04:53.280> super<00:04:53.550> right<00:04:53.729> or<00:04:53.970> super

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
they get it super super right or super

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.360 
they get it super super right or super
wrong<00:04:54.509> and<00:04:54.840> in<00:04:55.199> my<00:04:55.440> opinion<00:04:55.560> Beckett<00:04:56.130> I've<00:04:56.220> got

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
wrong and in my opinion Beckett I've got

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.490 
wrong and in my opinion Beckett I've got
it<00:04:56.490> exactly<00:04:56.729> the<00:04:57.210> way<00:04:57.389> it<00:04:57.569> should<00:04:57.599> be<00:04:57.750> so<00:04:58.409> the

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
it exactly the way it should be so the

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:59.990 
it exactly the way it should be so the
top<00:04:58.680> coat<00:04:58.860> goes<00:04:59.009> on<00:04:59.130> really<00:04:59.310> nice<00:04:59.580> and<00:04:59.789> thinly

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.000 
top coat goes on really nice and thinly

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.120 
top coat goes on really nice and thinly
which<00:05:00.509> is<00:05:00.780> exactly<00:05:00.990> what<00:05:01.349> you<00:05:01.470> want<00:05:01.620> for<00:05:01.889> every

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
which is exactly what you want for every

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.439 
which is exactly what you want for every
single<00:05:02.310> layer<00:05:02.550> of<00:05:02.580> polish<00:05:03.030> that<00:05:03.120> goes<00:05:03.270> on<00:05:03.300> your

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:03.449 
single layer of polish that goes on your

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:05.629 
single layer of polish that goes on your
nails<00:05:03.690> from<00:05:04.020> base<00:05:04.199> coat<00:05:04.440> to<00:05:04.470> top<00:05:04.800> coat<00:05:05.009> so<00:05:05.520> it's

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:05.639 
nails from base coat to top coat so it's

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:06.890 
nails from base coat to top coat so it's
very<00:05:05.699> important<00:05:06.120> to<00:05:06.180> cap<00:05:06.389> the<00:05:06.539> ends<00:05:06.780> of<00:05:06.870> your

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
very important to cap the ends of your

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.170 
very important to cap the ends of your
nail<00:05:07.110> polish<00:05:07.470> with<00:05:07.919> the<00:05:08.009> top<00:05:08.190> coat<00:05:08.400> you<00:05:09.030> should

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
nail polish with the top coat you should

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.120 
nail polish with the top coat you should
also<00:05:09.330> do<00:05:09.539> this<00:05:09.630> with<00:05:09.690> the<00:05:09.900> colors<00:05:10.199> itself<00:05:10.560> this

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
also do this with the colors itself this

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.100 
also do this with the colors itself this
helps<00:05:11.430> prevent<00:05:11.789> chipping<00:05:12.000> from<00:05:12.389> people<00:05:13.080> that

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
helps prevent chipping from people that

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.290 
helps prevent chipping from people that
type<00:05:13.470> a<00:05:13.650> lot<00:05:13.800> their<00:05:14.069> nails<00:05:14.250> will<00:05:14.400> chip<00:05:14.669> easier

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
type a lot their nails will chip easier

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.899 
type a lot their nails will chip easier
and<00:05:15.750> this<00:05:16.199> will<00:05:16.319> help<00:05:16.380> that<00:05:16.800> the<00:05:17.280> top<00:05:17.490> coat<00:05:17.699> is

00:05:17.899 --> 00:05:17.909 
and this will help that the top coat is

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:19.129 
and this will help that the top coat is
going<00:05:18.120> to<00:05:18.180> be<00:05:18.240> launched<00:05:18.539> with<00:05:18.719> the<00:05:18.750> halcyon

through<00:05:21.389> the<00:05:21.479> whole<00:05:21.599> Becca<00:05:21.780> range<00:05:22.080> so<00:05:22.590> I've

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
through the whole Becca range so I've

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.709 
through the whole Becca range so I've
applied<00:05:23.009> a<00:05:23.310> cuticle<00:05:23.639> oil<00:05:23.909> over<00:05:24.240> the<00:05:24.300> top<00:05:24.389> of

00:05:24.709 --> 00:05:24.719 
applied a cuticle oil over the top of

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:27.200 
applied a cuticle oil over the top of
the<00:05:25.080> finished<00:05:25.530> polish<00:05:25.949> and<00:05:26.250> this<00:05:27.060> will<00:05:27.180> help

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
the finished polish and this will help

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.240 
the finished polish and this will help
them<00:05:27.509> dry<00:05:27.750> and<00:05:28.199> what<00:05:28.380> it<00:05:28.469> does<00:05:28.650> it<00:05:28.889> provides

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
them dry and what it does it provides

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:30.860 
them dry and what it does it provides
almost<00:05:29.400> like<00:05:29.699> a<00:05:29.729> shield<00:05:30.060> over<00:05:30.389> the<00:05:30.449> top<00:05:30.630> of<00:05:30.659> the

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.870 
almost like a shield over the top of the

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.659 
almost like a shield over the top of the
Polish<00:05:31.169> so<00:05:31.710> if<00:05:31.830> they<00:05:31.919> come<00:05:32.069> into<00:05:32.190> contact<00:05:32.430> with

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:32.669 
Polish so if they come into contact with

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:35.059 
Polish so if they come into contact with
anything<00:05:32.969> and<00:05:33.360> it<00:05:33.960> will<00:05:34.169> probably<00:05:34.469> glide<00:05:34.919> over

00:05:35.059 --> 00:05:35.069 
anything and it will probably glide over

00:05:35.069 --> 00:05:37.610 
anything and it will probably glide over
the<00:05:35.190> top<00:05:35.430> obviously<00:05:36.150> if<00:05:36.240> you<00:05:36.409> knock<00:05:37.409> them<00:05:37.560> on

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 
the top obviously if you knock them on

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:38.779 
the top obviously if you knock them on
the<00:05:37.740> edge<00:05:37.800> of<00:05:37.889> a<00:05:37.949> table<00:05:37.979> they'll<00:05:38.370> probably<00:05:38.610> so

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:38.789 
the edge of a table they'll probably so

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:40.129 
the edge of a table they'll probably so
much<00:05:38.849> but<00:05:39.180> if<00:05:39.419> they<00:05:39.569> come<00:05:39.690> into<00:05:39.810> contact<00:05:39.870> with

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:40.139 
much but if they come into contact with

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:42.140 
much but if they come into contact with
clothes<00:05:40.500> or<00:05:41.009> something<00:05:41.699> that's<00:05:41.819> you<00:05:42.120> know

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
light or genital then it won't dent them

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:45.950 
light or genital then it won't dent them
or<00:05:44.580> smudge<00:05:44.789> them<00:05:44.969> so<00:05:45.389> this<00:05:45.539> is<00:05:45.569> the<00:05:45.779> finished

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960
