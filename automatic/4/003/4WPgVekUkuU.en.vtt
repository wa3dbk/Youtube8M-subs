00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
things pull the strap idea off

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.669 
things pull the strap idea off
throughout<00:00:16.679> the<00:00:17.039> window<00:00:18.349> not<00:00:19.349> going<00:00:19.529> to<00:00:19.589> do

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:19.679 
throughout the window not going to do

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:22.749 
throughout the window not going to do
that<00:00:19.970> going<00:00:20.970> to<00:00:21.029> put<00:00:21.210> too<00:00:21.330> much<00:00:21.480> stress<00:00:21.810> on<00:00:22.080> the

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:22.759 
that going to put too much stress on the

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:25.460 
that going to put too much stress on the
tank<00:00:23.759> silicon<00:00:24.419> on<00:00:24.509> the<00:00:24.689> bottom<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:25.109> all<00:00:25.259> in<00:00:25.349> it

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
tank silicon on the bottom and all in it

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.970 
tank silicon on the bottom and all in it
so<00:00:26.269> it<00:00:27.269> was<00:00:27.300> off<00:00:27.599> by<00:00:27.990> a<00:00:28.409> quarter<00:00:28.740> of<00:00:28.769> an<00:00:28.890> inch

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
so it was off by a quarter of an inch

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.400 
so it was off by a quarter of an inch
each<00:00:31.880> baffle<00:00:32.880> was<00:00:33.240> off<00:00:33.420> quarter<00:00:33.960> inch<00:00:34.170> so

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
each baffle was off quarter inch so

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.010 
each baffle was off quarter inch so
that's<00:00:34.590> an<00:00:34.710> eighth<00:00:34.830> of<00:00:35.040> an<00:00:35.160> inch<00:00:35.250> on<00:00:35.460> each<00:00:36.020> you

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
that's an eighth of an inch on each you

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.530 
that's an eighth of an inch on each you
know<00:00:37.140> edge<00:00:38.040> or<00:00:38.640> side<00:00:40.400> so<00:00:41.400> i<00:00:41.460> just<00:00:41.790> filled<00:00:42.210> up<00:00:42.330> so

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
know edge or side so i just filled up so

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.810 
know edge or side so i just filled up so
come<00:00:42.780> you<00:00:43.230> know<00:00:43.320> whatever<00:00:43.770> filling<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.610> gaps

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
come you know whatever filling the gaps

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.840 
come you know whatever filling the gaps
if<00:00:45.810> it<00:00:45.960> was<00:00:46.080> bigger<00:00:46.800> than<00:00:47.220> that<00:00:47.280> i<00:00:47.400> probably

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
if it was bigger than that i probably

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.140 
if it was bigger than that i probably
would<00:00:48.180> have<00:00:48.270> gotten<00:00:48.510> more<00:00:48.930> baffles<00:00:49.410> cut<00:00:50.150> right

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:51.150 
would have gotten more baffles cut right

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.540 
would have gotten more baffles cut right
now<00:00:52.040> doing<00:00:53.040> the<00:00:53.190> first<00:00:53.910> test<00:00:54.900> water<00:00:55.470> test<00:00:55.830> on

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550
