00:00:09.279 --> 00:00:12.579
 I am a teacher from the water in the ward 

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:15.129
 I want you to have time to learn about condensation facts. 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:17.099
 I'll do it 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:20.369
 Yesterday was the first of the education system in Spain 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:21.690
 I'll find out. 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.940
 If you search the Internet, 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:25.460
 For beginners, 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.409
 It has become difficult to burn 

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:31.529
 So let me explain as simple as possible. 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.270
 I'll try my best. 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.460
 The greatest advantage of CSEC 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.630
 It says that it is equipped with a dual core to use as a billion ceo. 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.510
 It's a cp engine. 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.469
 By the way, 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:50.429
 I can hardly be a little difficult. Galaxy ms has only one kidney 

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:50.940
 I did not. 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.650
 By the way, when I showed it, I added another kidney 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.320
 I made two kidneys. 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.600
 So I think that there are many collaborative 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.530
 You could have done it. 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.900
 Mom, who shoots what's coming 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.030
 It's possible to process the game in search or search. 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.600
 And 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.600
 Even when you download large files 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.680
 Administration can be implemented quickly 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.350
 Besides 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.350
 Extension of the function here 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.520
 It boasts excellent speed in multitasking. 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.460
 In March, the testing is called multi-program execution. 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.580
 For example 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.420
 I've been using the phone 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.630
 I use the Internet while talking on the phone, 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.299
 Use 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:39.500
 I also use the recording function and in this way 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.990
 Many things at once 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.340
 Running the program is called multitasking 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.530
 this 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.440
 You can also run those programs and get 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.659
 Processing speed 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:51.740
 It's an education system. 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.920
 It's a great opportunity. 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.790
 Our local ses 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.450
 Android Android based on kubo 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.380
 I'm running an operating system. 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.780
 The system that helps the billion won alternative is very simple. 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.199
 To say the downside 

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:12.599
 The advantage is that anyone in the world can develop applications 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.039
 You can distribute it. 

00:02:14.039 --> 00:02:15.779
 So for consumers, 

00:02:15.779 --> 00:02:18.530
 The number of more applications 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.899
 It means we can secure it in a short amount of time. 

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:22.400
 Disadvantages 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.719
 Anyone 

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:25.699
 Coffee opinions 

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:27.450
 I see you can produce and see L 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:28.899
 Sometimes, 

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:30.629
 Within 5% of unproven 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:33.150
 And whether the virus is infiltrating 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.909
 7 days when the battery goes fast or the smartphone is spreading 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:40.029
 There are occasions when the phenomenon occurs, and there is an exponent. 

00:02:40.029 --> 00:02:43.729
 So if you need the application you need 

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:45.630
 Press and installation 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.110
 A very important smartphone is in the middle of using it. 

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:52.230
 To get the details, 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.370
 Peasants such as Google Market 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.920
 I will explain it through a lecture on application installation. 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.229
 I'll do it 

00:02:59.229 --> 00:03:02.229
 In Galaxy s, the 1.2 version of the power button 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:06.559
 Galaxy 'satds somewhat in pdp 

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:07.619
 scarce 

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:11.579
 You've got a million won. 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:13.350
 Including these points 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.559
 Latest Android 1.3 

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:19.540
 os with ginger bread 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.379
 We can access 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:25.659
 Thanks to a lot of garbage disposal capacity and pros 

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.809
 Even in comparison 

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:28.280
 more than twice 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.739
 Listed 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.739
 Since the boot has been improved to show employment rates 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.930
 More 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.930
 You can use it conveniently. 

00:03:37.499 --> 00:03:40.290
 And .. 3-inch Super Novel Plus Plus 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.859
 Display fitted 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:42.960
 greatly 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.319
 I'm boasting a cool screen. 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.419
 In addition, Saffe's name draws colors and various 

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:53.200
 You can view the image at an angle, 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.369
 It is characteristic 

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:57.199
 In groups cs 

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:59.180
 updated play 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.180
 It took up 30% of battery consumption. 

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:05.969
 The power consumed by the forced display 

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:07.990
 18 degrees reduced 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:11.470
 The tragedy was launched by Jihyoung. 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:12.859
 so 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:15.090
 Batteries can last longer and 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.090
 More clear and 

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:23.210
 Galaxy string that can be used as a bigger and bigger screen 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:24.720
 It is. 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.720
 In addition, a variety of entertainment features 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.150
 Added video from editor edited 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.919
 Maker high 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:35.139
 Gamer service, etc. 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:36.900
 In the case of port, 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.500
 Photojournal Now with a cell phone 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.289
 I can do it on my smartphone. 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:44.969
 Call up the stored picture and select the desired area. 

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:48.779
 You can choose to copy it or delete it yet, 

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:50.779
 You can edit it using 

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:53.449
 And even in the case of video 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:56.879
 Calls the saved video and crops to the desired location 

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:57.949
 According to 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:00.280
 Video editing, etc. 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.340
 It's possible. In Galaxy, 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.560
 Take a camera, but you can access to an 8 megapixel camera 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.120
 We are equipped 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.120
 But when I look around 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.270
 The camera located on the front side also takes the trial, 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:18.639
 You are mistaken to use an 8 megapixel camera 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:19.680
 There are people 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.389
 Absolutely not. 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:23.280
 Editorial Galaxy Stone 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.960
 full hd 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.419
 Supports video 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:31.249
 The 8 megapixel camera that supports full hd video 

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:33.610
 Galaxy's Church 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.650
 The mask on the back is the pixel 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.599
 So with the camera on the front 

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:41.599
 When you take a self-portrait or make a video call 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.750
 Requires a 2 megapixel camera instead of 8 million pixels in high definition 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:46.439
 so 

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:48.619
 More clear 

00:05:48.619 --> 00:05:49.159
 In high definition 

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:53.089
 When you take a picture or use a movie, make sure you 

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:56.620
 Use the camera you're located in. 

00:05:56.619 --> 00:05:59.130
 I'd like you to use it. 

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:01.229
 Thickness was very well known. 

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:04.319
 The company's Galaxy svr was 9.9 days old 

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:09.539
 Yesterday, the system was 8.9 millimeters, 1 centimeter or more. 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.180
 You have signed up 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:12.509
 Administrative taxes. 

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:17.580
 Yesterday to make it through SK telecom or kt 8.02 Lilobakks 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:18.839
 sold out 

00:06:18.839 --> 00:06:20.790
 You can use your shoulder by mistake. 

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:25.310
 lg 6+ is thicker due to the communication module. 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:28.650
 One set for cs per group is 

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:32.410
 The short-range wireless communication and the 

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:35.960
 Direction sensors have been added. 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:39.119
 I can go sick, 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:40.819
 nfc 

00:06:40.819 --> 00:06:43.599
 It's short-range wireless. 

00:06:43.599 --> 00:06:46.949
 At a distance of 7cm, 

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:49.089
 It seems like technology to transmit 

00:06:49.089 --> 00:06:50.400
 From consumer to consumer 

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:54.130
 Whether you are deciding on a poem or in a supermarket or general store 

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:57.440
 Travel information for goods government or visitors 

00:06:58.409 --> 00:06:59.190
 And 

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:01.240
 When the main statistics lock 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.790
 Which can be used extensively 

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:04.990
 That's the technique. 

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:06.889
 And 

00:07:06.889 --> 00:07:09.810
 A direction sensor, called a free scope, 

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:12.979
 I'll mention it in the default settings, 

00:07:12.979 --> 00:07:14.619
 More diversified 

00:07:14.619 --> 00:07:18.419
 Using the direction sensor, 

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.650
 Sensitive to More Game Games 

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:24.650
 I'll give you such a ticket 

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:25.710
 Difficult 

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:29.289
 I've looked at each basic specification of the subject of innovation. 

00:07:29.289 --> 00:07:33.229
 Or to have such a good specification 

00:07:33.229 --> 00:07:35.050
 Training Practices 

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:36.879
 With your own smartphone 

00:07:36.879 --> 00:07:39.879
 One for me, one for me 

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:42.039
 Let's learn about it step by step 

00:07:42.039 --> 00:07:42.629
 Thank you
