 maximum 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:34.420
 and abandoned where to go to whom 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:38.360
 interesting I can say in a nutshell 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:42.500
 This icon appears after 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:44.440
 you make updates to the system through 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.670
 windows update center 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:50.969
 from here 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:56.129
 and like this at the window comes out clicking on this 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:58.820
 icon July 29 comes out windows 10 you 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.820
 can reserve 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.489
 and what's new 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:08.479
 small review 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:11.740
 but I don't need to close this here 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.740
 me by the note 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.670
 and here I have as much steam as a tick 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:23.310
 need to remove it all 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:25.800
 and so it means typing keyboard shortcut 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.140
 win ner 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:32.350
 you can dial a cent can be removed and 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.370
 compare to type this nights nir 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.700
 tom slash 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.700
 no has become 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:48.540
 Basically, I have already typed 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:52.150
 that's like 35 583 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.080
 let's say before deleting 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.330
 what is this method 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:01.009

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.009

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.270
 computer

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.200
 kb-32 583 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.209
 and waiting 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.629
 In general, here came the debt dialogue 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.310
 window remove another lenny 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:55.280

 microsoft windows 3-5 updates 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.939
 deletion occurs 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.540
 reboot often at the time not charge 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.670
 reload later and the same 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.900
 make others an update i'm not 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:17.550
 there is something they will be deleted if not then 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.620
 the system told us this means 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:27.680
 delete but i have this 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:31.920
 update watched 2952 664 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:34.880
 click ok and delete the following 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.120
 windows update program update 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.900
 click yes 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.900
 deleted 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:50.150
 reload later and again win-r and 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:53.540
 looking n know my legs are not looking for 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:58.070
 at least the system will report 30 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:04:02.450
 21 917 boevki 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:02.450
 this update I have the press 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:13.900
 now after deleting update data 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:16.570
 you need to restart your computer 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:20.130
 In principle , you may not have all of these. 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:25.480
 updates under these numbers 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:28.210
 but what is the system on the principle will inform 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:31.450
 so now no need to reboot 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:34.860
 system to get away from the icon 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:37.480
 these updates were completely removed and 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:40.300
 after reboot, I'll be back to show 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:43.450
 in general, the future also did not appear again 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:46.600
 this icon will get windows 10 so 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:49.520
 while pause restart computers and 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:54.510
 search for you 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:58.790
 so we continue after reboot 

00:04:54.510 --> 00:05:02.730
 long laptop systems 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:05.600
 as if installing the update setting 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:09.690
 then the update installation was a percentage 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:12.870
 so now we need this icon 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:14.570
 windows 10 icon silent food here 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:18.750
 never appeared again 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:21.350
 what we are doing for this will start 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:28.830
 Control Panel 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:32.360
 windows update center and search 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.360
 updates click wait 

00:06:06.249 --> 00:06:16.619
 so importantly updated 4 pieces available 

00:06:10.209 --> 00:06:24.960
 click on it and increases saw 

00:06:16.619 --> 00:06:30.620
 what are the numbers and that's actually my 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:30.620
 the note was taken here 52 

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:36.969
 666 4 

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:40.589
 I press a button 

00:06:36.969 --> 00:06:40.589
 hide updates 

00:06:42.079 --> 00:06:45.079
 farther 

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:52.240
 3621 917 pressing again creaks 

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:54.060
 updates 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:57.450
 and 

00:06:54.060 --> 00:07:02.510
 thirty thirty five hundred too hidden 

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:04.740
 update look 

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:06.810
 as you can see 

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:10.530
 and all the rivers of color that is these updates 

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:14.730
 more will not be put and you will have 

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:18.780
 icon get windows 10 on this 

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:21.900
 perhaps everyone who liked the video finger 

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:25.410
 up subscribe to the channel ask 

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:28.680
 questions also subscribe to the group 

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:30.570
 VKontakte I opened access for all 

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:32.630
 Shiba users could ask 

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:38.660
 questions to write something of their own 

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:43.440
 but at the same time you do not need spamming 

00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:45.500
 clutter up the groups so everybody thanks everyone 

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.500
 until
