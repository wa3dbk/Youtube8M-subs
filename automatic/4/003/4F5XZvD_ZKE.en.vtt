00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:26.069
 this experience earned him the presence of any idols 

00:00:26.069 --> 00:00:28.839
 so says the specialist in knee surgery 

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:34.739
 but to speak as it stands out according to the cetesb also smiled the player of 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.680
 football it 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.750
 and we know it's over 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:40.990
 many problems 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.990
 so I'll skip to a little of your specialty 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:48.440
 I was not expected to have training and orthopedics 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.440
 is replaced said virgÃ­lio knee 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.880
 so my daily life basically I try to 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.490
 patients who 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:00.140
 well up to the cost of knee culture 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.270
 I understand these patients 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.770
 we have patients are athletes 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:06.000
 it's not that the people 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.630
 some that are functional but most are paulo sergipe tocantins 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.680
 class representatives 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.400
 He already decided to play at the weekend. 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.550
 play with family friends 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.550
 and often in these banned games play ball 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.720
 from the head 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.820
 and why does this happen? 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.550
 the pants are varied in the dilma era 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.020
 the patient of a good athlete a person will hurt him knee 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.960
 first thing 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.320
 she will hurt with 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.290
 the palm mechanism 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.010
 grandson so she goes 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:41.960
 has an overload of July 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.470
 the running broke the puma running harder she was not ready 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.499
 to do 

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:50.220
 one divided 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.190
 one grass haiti 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:53.810
 two players 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.620
 taken have a prior history 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.790
 event 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.340
 physical and visual damage 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.610
 the action of the synthetic grass also entails 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.319
 the majority of society but the power 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.300
 many technical mechanisms of Italian knee 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.089
 will cause the donations 

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:16.589
 are caused by 

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:21.669
 twist more nor is it the silver plume fixed on the ground 

00:02:21.669 --> 00:02:25.479
 it is not possible to field in the field the world with a map of the city 

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:27.499
 for brito 

00:02:27.499 --> 00:02:30.089
 the boot is bigger 

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:32.229
 so the cap is fixed 

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:35.449
 usually causes a twisting of the corja's body 

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:37.329
 and compete with fix 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:40.719
 the knee is prepared to receive this professional load 

00:02:40.719 --> 00:02:45.129
 when lesions occur these lesions increase this mechanism are April 12 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:48.189
 throughout the south of the ministers 

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:50.329
 and it was now 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:53.329
 practically the same as in previous years 

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:56.809
 some ten years ago that was 

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:58.560
 together one of the fugitives 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.369
 nowadays 

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:01.669
 even on the street 

00:03:01.669 --> 00:03:03.280
 already reached 100 years 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:09.120
 technologies that causes you to have some water reaction 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.969
 we all sleep 

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:12.889
 still about your serious talk 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:18.869
 This easy digestion in the old fifteen years 20 years ended existed at one 

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:20.370
 video-arthroscopy 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.329
 it's not that the name itself says video 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:23.679
 the exact sense 

00:03:23.679 --> 00:03:25.359
 television monitors 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:30.769
 arthroscopy is associated with visualization of the joint 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:33.989
 they invented a technique through a camera 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.129
 you are very small 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:37.379
 5 minutes 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:40.509
 between the events of the knee are through the sport 

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:41.879
 5 millimeters 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:44.089
 trace the camera can shoot 

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:48.409
 every joint can not see meniscus-ligamentous cartilage 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:53.629
 many television every doctor can observe 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:56.669
 through these small incisions and can operate 

00:03:56.669 --> 00:03:59.309
 is with tweezers with skill 

00:03:59.309 --> 00:04:00.969
 things that formerly 

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:04.659
 for him visualizes solving alone and had to make one could be alive 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:05.190
 culture 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.299
 nor antecedent 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:11.109
 cascade but delay of aggression is greater 

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:13.329
 nowadays in small incisions 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:16.930
 you can perform surgery technically until 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.529
 we have improved more 

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:22.610
 as she is continually seeing other minor exceptions 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.819
 but more securely 

00:04:24.819 --> 00:04:26.039
 it is 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:29.500
 causes less postoperative pain, the patient can 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.789
 do better rehabilitation 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:36.590
 The next day he leaves the hospital walking with a light crutch. 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.259
 support for this year 

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:39.559
 but he can win 

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:42.649
 the bizarre aplub was triggered on July 6 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.610
 so you started 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.110
 world - sleep company much faster 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:49.330
 much more comfort 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.009
 she certainly has to win evolving 

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:55.009
 and now 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.979
 the invitation 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:01.589
 all alternative technologies medical report 

00:05:01.589 --> 00:05:04.400
 inside the house are on the track 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.550
 physical activity 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:07.509
 the first 

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:09.909
 different as it is said 

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:11.110
 all of us 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.809
 everyone should 

00:05:12.809 --> 00:05:15.650
 it's technical they are physical agents 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.650
 It's everyone I would conclude in their routine 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.849
 but after seeing the patient starts the activities 

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:27.180
 is to seek medical advice from the health professional to verify 

00:05:27.179 --> 00:05:30.430
 the person is able to practice 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.689
 and each nutrient they activity involving each 

00:05:34.689 --> 00:05:36.100
 at the time the young man 

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.319
 can make a more intense activity older phase 

00:05:39.319 --> 00:05:41.779
 lighter activity 

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:45.129
 its already had Indian physicists that is thing for all ages 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.580
 time the young man has 12 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:49.650
 part of it 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:50.470
 So 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.240
 the ideal is to do the activity irregularly 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.779
 in this to create a physical 

00:05:55.779 --> 00:05:57.680
 where is the rest of the vacancies 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.360
 if today the injuries are more brave spread the weekend athlete 

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:04.009
 who is not in good condition 

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:05.580
 nor overweight 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.249
 the musculature 

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:09.009
 strengthening 

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:11.560
 this ends up generating profit 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.729
 higher risk of injury 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:17.309
 So the guy that shocks me is a professional 

00:06:17.309 --> 00:06:19.520
 professional relationship around him 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.240
 a little later he resigns 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:25.529
 serene games on television high-performance athletes also got hurt 

00:06:26.169 --> 00:06:29.430
 but the seats being higher in the athlete the weekend 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.800
 then or paddle physical consoles 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.059
 regularity 

00:06:34.059 --> 00:06:34.970
 and thou 

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.610
 this is not being that in this process 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.810
 the course will be clear in the doubts always look for a professional 

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:43.909
 Thank you Luso for your attention. 

00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:46.230
 I miss 

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:47.280
 when the PT 

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:50.280
 various specialized stores 

00:06:51.439 --> 00:06:54.399
 taking this out maybe 

00:06:54.399 --> 00:06:56.159
 I did not know anything
