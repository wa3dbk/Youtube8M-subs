behind but if that happens all you got

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.280 
behind but if that happens all you got
to<00:03:33.459> do<00:03:33.580> is<00:03:33.760> just<00:03:33.970> keep<00:03:34.150> dumping<00:03:34.420> down<00:03:34.750> a<00:03:34.990> steady

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
to do is just keep dumping down a steady

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.710 
to do is just keep dumping down a steady
trail<00:03:35.680> of<00:03:35.890> mini<00:03:36.070> sentries<00:03:36.520> and<00:03:36.730> this<00:03:37.570> will

trail of mini sentries and this will

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.210 
trail of mini sentries and this will
either<00:03:37.780> slow<00:03:38.080> them<00:03:38.260> down<00:03:38.290> or<00:03:38.709> scare<00:03:39.010> them<00:03:39.160> away

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
either slow them down or scare them away

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.460 
either slow them down or scare them away
completely<00:03:39.900> once<00:03:40.900> you're<00:03:41.080> all<00:03:41.260> the<00:03:41.290> way

completely once you're all the way

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:42.900 
completely once you're all the way
behind<00:03:41.650> all<00:03:42.130> you<00:03:42.220> need<00:03:42.370> to<00:03:42.459> do<00:03:42.550> is<00:03:42.700> hide<00:03:42.880> a

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
behind all you need to do is hide a

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.430 
behind all you need to do is hide a
teleport<00:03:43.450> somewhere<00:03:43.570> where<00:03:43.900> the<00:03:43.959> enemy<00:03:44.260> isn't

teleport somewhere where the enemy isn't
going<00:03:44.740> to<00:03:44.800> find<00:03:45.010> it<00:03:45.190> then<00:03:45.580> make<00:03:45.790> your<00:03:45.910> way<00:03:45.970> over

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 
going to find it then make your way over

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.060 
going to find it then make your way over
to<00:03:46.450> their<00:03:46.690> spawn<00:03:46.990> and<00:03:47.260> start<00:03:47.530> ambushing

to their spawn and start ambushing

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.070 
to their spawn and start ambushing
people<00:03:48.190> as<00:03:48.490> they<00:03:48.610> walk<00:03:48.820> out<00:03:48.970> this<00:03:49.690> is<00:03:49.870> great

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
people as they walk out this is great

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.240 
people as they walk out this is great
for<00:03:50.290> a<00:03:50.350> few<00:03:50.620> reasons

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
for a few reasons

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:52.920 
for a few reasons
most<00:03:51.760> people<00:03:52.090> have<00:03:52.209> their<00:03:52.330> guard<00:03:52.510> down<00:03:52.660> when

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
most people have their guard down when

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.090 
most people have their guard down when
they<00:03:52.990> leave<00:03:53.170> spawn<00:03:53.440> meaning<00:03:53.860> they're<00:03:53.980> going

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
they leave spawn meaning they're going

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.980 
they leave spawn meaning they're going
to<00:03:54.160> be<00:03:54.220> pretty<00:03:54.580> surprised<00:03:55.150> when<00:03:55.360> a<00:03:55.480> crazy<00:03:55.780> an

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:55.990

back with a shocker and this should get

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:01.650 
back with a shocker and this should get
you<00:03:59.110> some<00:03:59.260> pretty<00:03:59.530> easy<00:03:59.830> kills<00:04:00.390> secondly<00:04:01.390> once
