00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.820
 The what was happening in the nuclear power plant at the time of accident 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:14.120
 Let's look at the power plant and the mechanism of nuclear energy to understand this 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:22.310
 A power plant is a big kettle 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:25.560
 By heating the water it's causing the electricity by turning the turbine with water steam this in a nuclear power plant day 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:35.370
 It's to sleep in nuclear power without 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:37.970
 Nuclear power is the Caracalla in just one second night of water of even 700 in Sugoi energy of sentence 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:42.290
 It is enough to evaporate 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:49.510
 By nuclear energy to disrupt the uranium 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:56.559
 It produces 95% kinetic energy and 5% radioactive energy 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:58.390
 Since kinetic energy turns into electricity immediately after turning the turbine, it should stop immediately at emergency stop 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:04.570
 Can 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:12.070
 But radioactive energy does not stop heat generation even if it stops chemical reaction 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:19.900
 I do this and not do to be kept continues to cool always a tremendous amount of water because 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:28.540
 If the reactor fails to cool down, radioactive energy will be out of control 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:32.060
 A high temperature steam and fuel container cause a chemical reaction to generate hydrogen and 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:35.090
 To order, with which hydrogen is generated so as not to explode 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:38.210
 It opens the reactor and escapes air 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:42.590
 It 's a work of joy called a bento 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:49.970
 But this work is fierce if it should fail 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:52.080
 Radioactivity I would cause a hydrogen explosion is contained in the spent fuel 1 ton continued at all the time 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:56.970
 Radioactive material 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:02:00.090
 It's so unreadable even if you dilute it with this water after one war year 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:06.120
 Stop to prevent such an accident 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:12.069
 The nuclear power plant has been claimed to be safe because it has the function of cost containment 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:19.689
 However, the power supply for operating the functions of the lunchbox has been 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:24.920
 Do not believe that it has become an accident, but believing that an accident may occur 

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:31.819
 You might have been able to reduce the damage if you did the drilled training 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:35.599
 If Although power has not been lost in the nuclear power plant, such as in Onagawa and Tokai University 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:42.460
 And or a bad weather or a high tide 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:48.940
 If the timing of the accident was bad, it could have been a more serious accident. 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:52.320
 A nuclear reactor that produces tremendous energy suffers so much damage as its mechanism breaks down. 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.320
 I will produce
