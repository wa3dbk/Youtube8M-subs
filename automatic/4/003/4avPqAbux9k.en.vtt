up it's the visual multitasking take a

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
up it's the visual multitasking take a
quick<00:01:35.189> look<00:01:35.310> at<00:01:35.490> some<00:01:35.520> of<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.820> applications

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
quick look at some of the applications

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.399 
quick look at some of the applications
here<00:01:36.509> you<00:01:36.630> can<00:01:36.750> see<00:01:36.900> we're<00:01:37.020> actually<00:01:37.110> running

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
here you can see we're actually running

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.170 
here you can see we're actually running
seven<00:01:37.890> applications<00:01:38.040> I<00:01:38.640> think<00:01:38.790> its<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:39.030> good

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
seven applications I think its a good

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.899 
seven applications I think its a good
indication<00:01:39.240> for<00:01:39.900> performance<00:01:40.549> just<00:01:41.549> pop<00:01:41.729> into

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
indication for performance just pop into

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.850
