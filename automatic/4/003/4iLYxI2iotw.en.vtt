Matt over on Facebook he had a question

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.850 
Matt over on Facebook he had a question
about<00:00:08.309> my<00:00:08.970> latency<00:00:09.510> settings<00:00:09.780> for<00:00:10.200> scratching

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
about my latency settings for scratching

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.530 
about my latency settings for scratching
with<00:00:11.160> the<00:00:11.190> tractor<00:00:12.019> controller<00:00:14.179> my<00:00:15.179> latency

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
with the tractor controller my latency

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.710 
with the tractor controller my latency
settings<00:00:15.750> is<00:00:16.049> at<00:00:16.199> 384<00:00:17.130> that's<00:00:17.820> what<00:00:17.970> is<00:00:18.090> it<00:00:18.270> for

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
settings is at 384 that's what is it for

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.670 
settings is at 384 that's what is it for
the<00:00:18.810> overall<00:00:19.250> latency<00:00:20.990> summer<00:00:21.990> demonstrated

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
the overall latency summer demonstrated

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.650 
the overall latency summer demonstrated
with<00:00:23.100> it<00:00:23.220> being<00:00:23.430> set<00:00:23.670> at<00:00:23.789> that<00:00:23.939> with<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.300> with

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
with it being set at that with the with

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.029 
with it being set at that with the with
the<00:00:24.810> deck<00:00:25.050> off<00:00:25.260> right<00:00:25.680> now

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
the deck off right now

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.150 
the deck off right now
hopefully<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.640> mic<00:00:26.849> is<00:00:27.029> not<00:00:28.160> sounding

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
hopefully the mic is not sounding

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.620 
hopefully the mic is not sounding
distorted<00:00:29.609> cuz<00:00:29.760> I<00:00:29.789> got<00:00:29.970> this<00:00:30.150> going<00:00:30.359> through

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
distorted cuz I got this going through

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.830 
distorted cuz I got this going through
my<00:00:30.779> Canon<00:00:31.320> t3i<00:00:31.500> camera<00:00:32.279> which<00:00:33.059> I'm<00:00:33.270> using<00:00:33.540> now

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
my Canon t3i camera which I'm using now

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.330 
my Canon t3i camera which I'm using now
for<00:00:34.079> some<00:00:34.350> of<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.530> videos<00:00:34.829> that<00:00:34.860> I'm<00:00:35.070> doing

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
for some of the videos that I'm doing

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.620 
for some of the videos that I'm doing
since<00:00:35.640> I<00:00:35.760> bought<00:00:35.910> this<00:00:36.059> thing<00:00:36.300> I'm<00:00:36.390> gonna<00:00:36.480> try

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
since I bought this thing I'm gonna try

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.060 
since I bought this thing I'm gonna try
to<00:00:36.660> use<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.020> camera<00:00:37.380> my<00:00:37.950> HD<00:00:38.340> camcorder<00:00:38.879> so

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
to use the camera my HD camcorder so

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.600 
to use the camera my HD camcorder so
yeah<00:00:41.540> just<00:00:42.540> demonstrated<00:00:42.960> little<00:00:43.140> scratching

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.610 
yeah just demonstrated little scratching

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.400 
yeah just demonstrated little scratching
with<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.640> put<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.360> dick<00:00:45.570> off<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:45.840> then<00:00:46.350> I

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
with the put the dick off and then I

00:00:46.410 --> 00:01:33.020 
with the put the dick off and then I
will<00:00:46.530> cut<00:00:46.739> it<00:00:46.770> on

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.420 

so<00:01:34.030> you<00:01:34.330> can<00:01:34.510> hear<00:01:34.930> it<00:01:34.960> sounds<00:01:35.500> pretty<00:01:35.770> good

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
so you can hear it sounds pretty good

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.010 
so you can hear it sounds pretty good
isn't<00:01:36.910> that<00:01:36.940> perfect<00:01:37.300> it's<00:01:37.660> not<00:01:37.810> like<00:01:37.990> a

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
isn't that perfect it's not like a

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.230 
isn't that perfect it's not like a
record<00:01:38.530> but<00:01:39.220> it<00:01:39.340> sounds<00:01:39.670> better<00:01:39.880> than<00:01:40.000> they

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
record but it sounds better than they

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.180 
record but it sounds better than they
did<00:01:40.390> before<00:01:40.600> so<00:01:41.500> now<00:01:41.710> I'm<00:01:41.800> gonna<00:01:41.920> put<00:01:42.010> the

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
did before so now I'm gonna put the

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.420 
did before so now I'm gonna put the
camera<00:01:42.970> on<00:01:43.000> the<00:01:43.210> screen<00:01:43.510> so<00:01:43.690> you<00:01:43.840> can<00:01:43.870> see

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
camera on the screen so you can see

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:50.010 
camera on the screen so you can see
where<00:01:45.430> my<00:01:45.479> latency<00:01:46.479> settings<00:01:46.750> are<00:01:47.520> on<00:01:48.520> this<00:01:49.090> on

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
where my latency settings are on this on

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.830 
where my latency settings are on this on
tractor<00:01:50.560> right<00:01:50.770> now<00:01:50.979> in<00:01:51.729> the<00:01:51.970> audio<00:01:52.330> settings

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
tractor right now in the audio settings

00:01:52.840 --> 00:02:07.199 
tractor right now in the audio settings
so<00:01:53.260> we'll<00:01:53.470> go<00:01:53.620> to<00:01:53.680> that<00:01:53.860> right<00:01:54.070> now

00:02:07.199 --> 00:02:07.209 

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:09.580 

so<00:02:08.209> as<00:02:08.330> you<00:02:08.420> can<00:02:08.569> see<00:02:08.750> my<00:02:08.929> latency<00:02:09.349> settings

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
so as you can see my latency settings

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.240 
so as you can see my latency settings
are<00:02:09.920> set<00:02:10.250> it<00:02:10.930> latency<00:02:11.930> it<00:02:11.989> said<00:02:12.170> at<00:02:12.319> 384<00:02:12.950> right

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
are set it latency it said at 384 right

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.089 
are set it latency it said at 384 right
now<00:02:13.400> sometimes<00:02:13.970> I<00:02:14.390> put<00:02:14.569> it<00:02:14.690> on<00:02:14.750> 512<00:02:15.349> but<00:02:15.560> 384

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
now sometimes I put it on 512 but 384

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:16.720 
now sometimes I put it on 512 but 384
right<00:02:16.310> now

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
right now

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.580 
right now
that's<00:02:17.330> the<00:02:17.480> latency<00:02:17.810> settings<00:02:17.989> I<00:02:18.200> got<00:02:18.379> it<00:02:18.500> on

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
that's the latency settings I got it on

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.229 
that's the latency settings I got it on
for<00:02:18.860> scratching<00:02:19.459> if<00:02:19.580> you<00:02:19.670> cut<00:02:19.849> it<00:02:19.879> up<00:02:20.030> higher

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
for scratching if you cut it up higher

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:22.270 
for scratching if you cut it up higher
you<00:02:20.569> know<00:02:20.989> it's<00:02:21.080> gonna<00:02:21.200> sound<00:02:21.410> like<00:02:21.560> total

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
you know it's gonna sound like total

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.460 
you know it's gonna sound like total
crap<00:02:22.310> you<00:02:22.910> know<00:02:22.940> that<00:02:23.090> and<00:02:23.900> this<00:02:24.080> up<00:02:24.260> higher

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
crap you know that and this up higher

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.259 
crap you know that and this up higher
than<00:02:24.739> that<00:02:24.890> then<00:02:25.099> it's<00:02:25.250> gonna<00:02:25.400> sound<00:02:25.580> if<00:02:26.060> the

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
than that then it's gonna sound if the

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:29.020 
than that then it's gonna sound if the
scratches<00:02:26.690> are<00:02:26.810> gonna<00:02:26.959> be<00:02:27.110> all<00:02:27.260> off<00:02:27.560> so<00:02:28.519> I<00:02:28.819> was

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
scratches are gonna be all off so I was

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.520 
scratches are gonna be all off so I was
just<00:02:29.060> messing<00:02:29.540> with<00:02:29.569> it<00:02:29.810> just<00:02:29.930> play<00:02:30.200> with<00:02:30.380> it<00:02:30.500> a

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
just messing with it just play with it a

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:31.809 
just messing with it just play with it a
little<00:02:30.560> bit<00:02:30.830> but<00:02:30.980> I<00:02:31.010> think<00:02:31.099> the<00:02:31.400> lord<00:02:31.640> of

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
little bit but I think the lord of

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:33.280 
little bit but I think the lord of
latency<00:02:32.090> is<00:02:32.330> the<00:02:32.480> better<00:02:32.690> the<00:02:32.780> scratching

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
latency is the better the scratching

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.369 
latency is the better the scratching
will<00:02:33.440> sound<00:02:33.849> so<00:02:34.849> with<00:02:35.330> that<00:02:35.480> being<00:02:35.690> said<00:02:35.959> I'll

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:36.379 
will sound so with that being said I'll

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:38.320 
will sound so with that being said I'll
see<00:02:36.530> you<00:02:36.560> guys<00:02:36.769> on<00:02:36.830> the<00:02:37.099> next<00:02:37.489> video
