00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
the fireside firewall side the engine

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.290 
the fireside firewall side the engine
side<00:01:44.030> just<00:01:45.030> unbolt<00:01:45.360> it<00:01:45.570> they<00:01:45.720> pull<00:01:45.930> right<00:01:46.110> out

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
course this wire and a couple others

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.380 
course this wire and a couple others
just<00:01:56.100> like<00:01:56.280> two<00:01:56.490> connections<00:01:57.000> I'll<00:01:57.119> show<00:01:57.270> you

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
just like two connections I'll show you

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.020 
just like two connections I'll show you
in<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.540> photographs<00:01:58.610> of<00:01:59.610> course<00:01:59.820> you<00:01:59.880> got<00:01:59.970> to

take those therefore like this stuff so

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:27.710 
take those therefore like this stuff so
that<00:02:16.830> bolt<00:02:17.840> goes<00:02:19.220> up<00:02:20.220> here<00:02:25.250> that<00:02:26.250> bolt<00:02:26.720> goes

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
that bolt goes up here that bolt goes

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.630 
that bolt goes up here that bolt goes
right<00:02:29.390> there

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:42.090 

that<00:02:34.640> screw<00:02:36.340> goes<00:02:37.340> right<00:02:37.730> here<00:02:39.790> this<00:02:40.790> screw
