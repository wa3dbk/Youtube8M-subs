00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
alright I'm here at hunter Creek and

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.460 
alright I'm here at hunter Creek and
I<00:00:08.640> was<00:00:09.210> digging<00:00:09.390> that<00:00:09.600> out<00:00:09.660> this<00:00:09.990> crack<00:00:10.260> with

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:10.470 
I was digging that out this crack with

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.080 
I was digging that out this crack with
my<00:00:10.590> hand<00:00:10.950> because<00:00:11.340> it<00:00:11.490> was<00:00:11.610> really<00:00:11.910> using

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
my hand because it was really using

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.960 
my hand because it was really using
material

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:14.970 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.530 

just

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:17.540 
just

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:27.340 
just
and<00:00:18.020> I'll<00:00:18.170> show<00:00:18.350> you<00:00:18.380> what<00:00:18.530> I<00:00:18.560> found

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:27.350 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:34.480 

okay<00:00:28.350> so<00:00:29.840> if<00:00:30.840> I<00:00:30.960> look<00:00:31.080> at<00:00:31.170> this<00:00:31.260> material<00:00:31.470> here

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:34.490 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.340 

go<00:00:35.000> ahead<00:00:35.240> and<00:00:35.330> classify<00:00:35.720> this<00:00:35.780> a<00:00:35.900> bit<00:00:36.110> shake

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
go ahead and classify this a bit shake

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.230 
go ahead and classify this a bit shake
it<00:00:36.440> around<00:00:37.660> so<00:00:38.660> you<00:00:38.720> can<00:00:38.840> see<00:00:38.960> the<00:00:39.080> clay<00:00:40.240> penny

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:41.240 
it around so you can see the clay penny

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.140 
it around so you can see the clay penny
right<00:00:41.390> here<00:00:41.540> I'm<00:00:41.600> gonna<00:00:41.720> lift<00:00:41.840> this<00:00:41.960> up<00:00:43.120> now<00:00:44.120> I

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:44.150 
right here I'm gonna lift this up now I

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.050 
right here I'm gonna lift this up now I
hit<00:00:44.360> some<00:00:44.510> clay<00:00:44.780> which<00:00:45.110> is<00:00:45.260> fantastic<00:00:45.440> because

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:46.060 
hit some clay which is fantastic because

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:52.330 
hit some clay which is fantastic because
when<00:00:47.060> I<00:00:47.090> hit<00:00:47.210> clay<00:00:47.510> I<00:00:48.010> move<00:00:49.010> it<00:00:49.100> over<00:00:49.250> here<00:00:51.340> when

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
when I hit clay I move it over here when

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.280 
when I hit clay I move it over here when
I<00:00:52.370> hit<00:00:52.580> play<00:00:52.760> you're<00:00:53.180> likely<00:00:53.480> to<00:00:53.660> find<00:00:53.930> a<00:00:54.110> lot

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.290 
I hit play you're likely to find a lot

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.930 
I hit play you're likely to find a lot
of<00:00:54.320> gold<00:00:54.590> stuck<00:00:55.040> on<00:00:55.220> top<00:00:55.489> of<00:00:55.550> it<00:00:56.020> so<00:00:57.670> if<00:00:58.670> there's

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
of gold stuck on top of it so if there's

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.900 
of gold stuck on top of it so if there's
gold<00:00:59.180> in<00:00:59.239> the<00:00:59.360> area<00:00:59.390> obviously<00:01:00.640> there<00:01:01.640> is<00:01:01.760> in

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
gold in the area obviously there is in

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:08.050 
gold in the area obviously there is in
this<00:01:02.059> area

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:12.340 

but<00:01:08.659> uh<00:01:09.189> here's<00:01:10.189> this<00:01:10.430> the<00:01:10.960> perfect<00:01:11.960> kind<00:01:12.229> of

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
but uh here's this the perfect kind of

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.300 
but uh here's this the perfect kind of
clay<00:01:12.500> you<00:01:12.560> can<00:01:12.680> kind<00:01:12.979> of<00:01:13.040> get<00:01:13.189> doing

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
clay you can kind of get doing

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.030 
clay you can kind of get doing
as<00:01:15.820> long<00:01:16.090> as<00:01:16.119> gold<00:01:16.659> has<00:01:16.869> had<00:01:17.380> the<00:01:17.500> chance<00:01:17.530> to

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 
as long as gold has had the chance to

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.399 
as long as gold has had the chance to
erode<00:01:18.909> down<00:01:19.119> the<00:01:19.270> river<00:01:19.450> it's<00:01:19.689> likely<00:01:20.020> to<00:01:20.140> stop

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409 
erode down the river it's likely to stop

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:21.929 
erode down the river it's likely to stop
and<00:01:20.680> not<00:01:20.710> be<00:01:20.950> able<00:01:21.070> to<00:01:21.130> see<00:01:21.340> through<00:01:21.670> this

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:21.939 
and not be able to see through this

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:26.210 
and not be able to see through this
dense<00:01:22.329> clay<00:01:22.630> here

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.070 

here's<00:01:26.820> some<00:01:26.940> more<00:01:27.030> of<00:01:27.210> it

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
here's some more of it

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.270 
here's some more of it
until<00:01:29.710> it's<00:01:29.890> really<00:01:30.040> kind<00:01:30.310> of<00:01:30.400> difficult

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.780 

now<00:01:33.850> if<00:01:34.480> you<00:01:34.630> look<00:01:34.750> on<00:01:34.960> top<00:01:35.170> of<00:01:35.350> it<00:01:35.580> you<00:01:36.580> see<00:01:36.760> a

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
now if you look on top of it you see a

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.050 
now if you look on top of it you see a
lot<00:01:37.000> of<00:01:37.030> blacks<00:01:37.390> in<00:01:37.690> there<00:01:38.700> which<00:01:39.700> is<00:01:39.730> just<00:01:40.000> a

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
lot of blacks in there which is just a

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.250 
lot of blacks in there which is just a
little<00:01:40.240> iron<00:01:40.450> pieces

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.260 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.140 

but<00:01:43.830> the<00:01:43.890> whole<00:01:43.980> point<00:01:44.190> is<00:01:44.370> if<00:01:44.400> I<00:01:44.760> run<00:01:44.910> this<00:01:45.030> to

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
but the whole point is if I run this to

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.789 
but the whole point is if I run this to
the<00:01:45.240> solute<00:01:45.450> box<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:46.530> run<00:01:46.680> a<00:01:46.710> few<00:01:46.860> pieces<00:01:47.070> here

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:55.220 

when<00:01:51.280> I<00:01:51.310> ran<00:01:51.520> through<00:01:51.729> the<00:01:51.820> sluice<00:01:52.030> box

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:55.230 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:07.649 

I<00:01:55.350> kind<00:01:55.830> of<00:01:55.860> have<00:01:56.010> to<00:01:56.040> shake<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:56.430> apart

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:09.270 

and<00:02:08.050> sometimes<00:02:08.470> there's<00:02:08.649> still<00:02:08.860> little<00:02:09.009> clay

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
and sometimes there's still little clay

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:16.520 
and sometimes there's still little clay
bits<00:02:10.020> that<00:02:11.020> I<00:02:11.050> don't<00:02:11.319> break<00:02:11.800> apart<00:02:13.110> now

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.500 

the<00:02:17.010> reason<00:02:17.250> why<00:02:17.370> clay<00:02:17.610> is<00:02:17.670> so<00:02:17.880> good<00:02:18.090> again<00:02:18.360> is

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
the reason why clay is so good again is

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.210 
the reason why clay is so good again is
because<00:02:19.670> when<00:02:20.670> gold<00:02:21.590> meets<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.800> clay<00:02:23.010> it

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
because when gold meets the clay it

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.600 
because when gold meets the clay it
can't<00:02:23.490> see<00:02:23.730> penny<00:02:24.000> deeper<00:02:24.450> because<00:02:24.870> it's<00:02:25.260> just

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
can't see penny deeper because it's just

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.190 
can't see penny deeper because it's just
too<00:02:26.640> there's<00:02:27.090> too<00:02:27.210> much<00:02:27.330> resistance<00:02:27.750> for<00:02:28.110> the

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
too there's too much resistance for the

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.440 
too there's too much resistance for the
gold<00:02:28.470> to<00:02:29.210> kind<00:02:30.210> of<00:02:31.490> push<00:02:32.490> itself<00:02:32.880> down<00:02:33.060> or<00:02:33.300> make

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
gold to kind of push itself down or make

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.560 
gold to kind of push itself down or make
its<00:02:33.600> way<00:02:33.750> down<00:02:34.020> through<00:02:34.730> so<00:02:35.730> if<00:02:36.209> you<00:02:36.330> can<00:02:36.450> get

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
its way down through so if you can get

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.930 
its way down through so if you can get
down<00:02:36.720> the<00:02:36.870> clay<00:02:37.250> go<00:02:38.250> ahead<00:02:38.490> and<00:02:38.610> write<00:02:38.760> for

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
down the clay go ahead and write for

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.370 
down the clay go ahead and write for
your<00:02:39.000> sleuth<00:02:39.300> box<00:02:39.570> and<00:02:39.780> you'll<00:02:39.870> usually<00:02:40.020> find

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
your sleuth box and you'll usually find

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.380 
your sleuth box and you'll usually find
a<00:02:40.560> little<00:02:40.770> bit<00:02:41.010> more<00:02:41.310> gold<00:02:41.580> on<00:02:41.790> top<00:02:42.090> of<00:02:42.270> it

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
a little bit more gold on top of it

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.270 
a little bit more gold on top of it
sometimes<00:02:43.260> you<00:02:43.530> want<00:02:43.680> in<00:02:43.770> the<00:02:43.860> middle<00:02:44.130> because

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
sometimes you want in the middle because

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.040 
sometimes you want in the middle because
it's<00:02:44.640> just<00:02:44.760> too<00:02:44.910> dense<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.330> gold<00:02:45.510> can't<00:02:45.840> see

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
it's just too dense the gold can't see

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.280 
it's just too dense the gold can't see
through<00:02:46.320> it<00:02:46.410> but<00:02:46.650> if<00:02:47.580> you<00:02:47.760> if<00:02:48.360> you<00:02:48.540> mine<00:02:49.050> that

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
through it but if you if you mine that

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.199 
through it but if you if you mine that
down<00:02:49.470> even<00:02:49.680> more

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:53.910 

we<00:02:52.689> might<00:02:52.840> get<00:02:52.959> another<00:02:53.019> layer<00:02:53.469> of<00:02:53.650> gold
