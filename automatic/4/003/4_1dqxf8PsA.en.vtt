00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.410
 internet revolutionized a certain 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.640
 number of behaviors including the 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.690
 customer compared from before 

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.690
 lyon learn more 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.410
 the new client today they 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.510
 ask for real time we accept to 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.770
 less and less to wait 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.410
 and so you really have to be able to 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.420
 to inform in real time about the progress 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.790
 these steps and it's absolutely worth 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.960
 for all products even for example 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.970
 for real estate credit 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.250
 we are often told the mortgage 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.140
 it's something important you have to 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.760
 to talk to someone in front 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.270
 to face 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.070
 obviously it's something 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.550
 important it is an important act for 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.260
 our students 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.540
 but we can quite put at his 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.640
 provision of tools for him 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.350
 to enter his request for 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.890
 inform him of the state of the treatment of his 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.390
 request 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.809
 and then counselors who can 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.089
 absolutely teach them on the phone 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.129
 beyond we work a lot on the 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:02.699
 customer journey and on the possibility 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.290
 for him to have remote services 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.739
 which allow him to better manage his 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.780
 accounts 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.920
 we work a lot, especially on 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.490
 something called the 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.409
 moneycenter which is a way for the 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.420
 bursorama customers to have access 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.130
 obviously to the account of boursorama 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.900
 but also to the accounts that holds in 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.500
 other establishments on the site 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.270
 boursorama 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.180
 we have a production of credits 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.900
 real estate that doubled in two 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.610
 we have today 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.990
 together our customers who have a credit 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.510
 real estate at boursorama 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.360
 making it less good than our 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.490
 proposition and our ways of doing this 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.150
 furniture credit meets a wide 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.830
 public 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.840
 then a way of doing of boursorama 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.609
 on credit 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.979
 we took a little different party 

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:46.229
 conventional banks and especially the 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.149
 customer to an immediate response from 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.460
 first principle the real estate credit 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.380
 this is one of the main needs of 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.240
 french can buy an apartment 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.890
 bought a second home is 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.479
 something very important so he 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.509
 we must be able to respond to this need 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.219
 there then a bank is getting ready so he 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.179
 was important for boursorama to have 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.090
 a full range of credits 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:07.770
 real estate and personal it was a 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.679
 sector on which we invest a lot 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.019
 on which we have set up 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.970
 processes that are really very 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:16.530
 effective that allows us to have 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.819
 really real time information 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.629
 client 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.840
 I think it's very important 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.519
 today 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.709
 the customer he can understand that it takes 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:25.500
 a little bit of time to deal with 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.470
 mortgage application a 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.120
 support not to know blood 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.680
 so we work of price the addition 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.599
 also on dematerialization 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:37.040
 to be able to have a more efficient process 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:37.040
 and faster for customers
