thing<00:00:50.480> about<00:00:50.559> TC<00:00:51.559> for<00:00:51.860> is<00:00:52.100> it<00:00:52.250> has<00:00:52.370> the

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
thing about TC for is it has the

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.150 
thing about TC for is it has the
Christmas<00:00:52.789> and<00:00:53.180> feel<00:00:53.570> of<00:00:53.600> carbon<00:00:54.230> but<00:00:54.920> it<00:00:55.010> has

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
Christmas and feel of carbon but it has

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.910 
Christmas and feel of carbon but it has
that<00:00:55.430> bendy<00:00:55.879> like<00:00:56.120> feel<00:00:56.510> of<00:00:56.750> glass<00:00:57.260> which

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
that bendy like feel of glass which

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.979 
that bendy like feel of glass which
obviously<00:00:58.550> we<00:00:58.850> need<00:00:59.000> for<00:00:59.239> when<00:00:59.510> we're<00:00:59.660> fishing

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
obviously we need for when we're fishing

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:07.899 
obviously we need for when we're fishing

the other side that's how it's supposed

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.779 
the other side that's how it's supposed
to<00:01:25.869> be<00:01:25.990> right<00:01:26.250> cast<00:01:27.250> and<00:01:27.430> get<00:01:27.520> one<00:01:27.610> on<00:01:27.700> the

00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:27.789 
to be right cast and get one on the

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:30.960 
to be right cast and get one on the

what<00:01:34.299> it's<00:01:34.390> built<00:01:34.539> for<00:01:34.659> so<00:01:35.049> crank<00:01:35.320> baits<00:01:35.530> we

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
what it's built for so crank baits we

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.969 
what it's built for so crank baits we
even<00:01:36.429> have<00:01:36.700> on<00:01:36.939> the<00:01:37.030> butt<00:01:37.210> section<00:01:37.479> here<00:01:37.990> the

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
even have on the butt section here the

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:40.590 
even have on the butt section here the

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
a little stink on me watch out now now

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.440 
a little stink on me watch out now now
it's<00:01:58.299> like<00:01:58.390> a<00:01:58.450> mouse<00:01:58.690> on<00:01:59.399> on<00:02:00.399> like<00:02:00.700> Donkey<00:02:01.240> Kong

still<00:02:25.540> relatively<00:02:25.989> new<00:02:26.200> there's<00:02:26.980> a<00:02:27.040> billion

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
still relatively new there's a billion

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.130 
still relatively new there's a billion
types<00:02:27.790> of<00:02:28.030> different<00:02:28.209> ways<00:02:28.600> you<00:02:28.630> can<00:02:28.810> rig<00:02:29.109> the

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
types of different ways you can rig the

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.930 
types of different ways you can rig the
thing<00:02:29.470> they<00:02:29.920> come<00:02:30.070> in<00:02:30.190> different<00:02:30.370> weights<00:02:30.700> and

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
thing they come in different weights and

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.880 
thing they come in different weights and
sizes<00:02:31.120> so<00:02:31.900> we<00:02:32.049> kind<00:02:32.230> of<00:02:32.290> narrowed<00:02:32.590> it<00:02:32.680> down<00:02:32.709> to

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
sizes so we kind of narrowed it down to

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.130 
sizes so we kind of narrowed it down to
one<00:02:33.400> specific<00:02:34.000> one<00:02:34.540> that's<00:02:34.750> just<00:02:34.930> going<00:02:35.079> to

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
one specific one that's just going to

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.530 
one specific one that's just going to
get<00:02:35.260> the<00:02:35.380> job<00:02:35.620> done<00:02:35.880> so<00:02:36.880> this<00:02:37.060> one<00:02:37.239> here<00:02:37.390> we're

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
get the job done so this one here we're

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:38.789 
get the job done so this one here we're
going<00:02:37.630> to<00:02:37.720> talk<00:02:37.870> about<00:02:38.019> is<00:02:38.230> the<00:02:38.260> spinner<00:02:38.620> bait

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
properly your casts are going to be all

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.220 
properly your casts are going to be all
over<00:03:12.370> the<00:03:12.730> place<00:03:12.940> you're<00:03:13.750> not<00:03:13.870> going<00:03:13.989> to<00:03:14.049> be
