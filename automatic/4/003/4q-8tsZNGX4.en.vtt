00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
have been frustrating me but um whatever

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.390 
have been frustrating me but um whatever
they're<00:00:51.560> simple<00:00:52.340> but<00:00:53.350> their<00:00:54.350> simplicity<00:00:54.710> lies

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:55.400 
they're simple but their simplicity lies

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.860 
they're simple but their simplicity lies
in<00:00:55.670> the<00:00:55.760> fact<00:00:55.910> that<00:00:56.090> they<00:00:56.270> have<00:00:56.450> a<00:00:56.480> reverse

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
in the fact that they have a reverse

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:59.080 
in the fact that they have a reverse
plunger<00:00:57.410> and<00:00:57.590> you<00:00:58.130> can't<00:00:58.370> do<00:00:58.550> anything<00:00:58.580> with

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.090 
plunger and you can't do anything with

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:10.470 
plunger and you can't do anything with
them<00:00:59.210> and<00:01:00.050> it's<00:01:01.000> frustrating

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:10.480 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.850
