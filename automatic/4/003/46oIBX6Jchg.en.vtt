 Hello evening Good morning 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:22.369
 This is a vulture class and this time the seeds I put on ps vita 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:25.930
 I would like to introduce the spot that there is unevenness in the spawn point is surprisingly unusual 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:29.440
 How do you think 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:35.500
 I found a wonderful tofu in the village at Pawn Point 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:41.410
 Tofu is usually made a fool, but it is naturally produced 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:41.920
 I will continue to take pride in making tofu from now on exposed with this seed 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.920
 The 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:51.440
 You can get all three of the diamonds 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:52.039
 Even if you only see Eva, there will be 6 but maybe 10 or so. 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:58.190
 Hmm 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:01:01.820
 Well whether it is all drowning is a different matter in magma , but in the hole with the zombie thing Bonner 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:05.909
 Knockback's salt security and books were included 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:10.469
 I'm glad the knock back is sober, I have not gotta 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:13.890
 Floating in the air is after is quite want because I like reply to 

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:17.310
 Maekawa Pyutai went to the venue 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:23.770
 The grandeur of the underground cave has been achieved 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:30.549
 It 's really fun to explore the world of Minecraft 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:36.310
 So what are the coordinates of each point after this display is every time is every time your attention in this video 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:39.090
 If you want to find something by yourself after all, it is better if you do not look in the future 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.360
 I think you thank you and
