00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:09.660
 good morning is 6 o'clock in the morning 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:13.680
 and I'm going to the sheet 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:17.180
 by mouths yes 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:20.300
 there is my car arrived late 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:23.380
 I do not know if it will be good because I'm not going to the 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.380
 fish market because I did this 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.270
 one 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.870
 well I have arrived is waiting for me 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.380
 there is the port because it has come 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.380
 because I'm late 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.079
 good we entered the fish market here is 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:02.250
 all 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.879
 the move as you see auction 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.879
 this year 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.950
 because the mission of these rejected in the 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.190
 Puerto de Vigo is to prevent the 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.190
 gulls 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.280
 always for the auction rooms and 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.010
 good with a fish 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.020
 basically pollute it very 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.280
 well I will give you data the auction 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.560
 vigo is among the five most 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:30.000
 important in the world if we are here 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.000
 we receive fish 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.870
 of South America from Europe but more 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.930
 important is the great sun that is the area 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:41.540
 from Ireland 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:43.250
 the most important data at eleven o'clock in the 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.980
 night maybe the downloads until 4 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.830
 the morning classifies everything 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.910
 at the auction if the fish is going away 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.160
 to everywhere 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.750
 well this is all now I'm going to 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.840
 do what I think everyone is 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.840
 waiting 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.070
 both little ones 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:13.230
 but cool that I still have not got 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.230
 apart from a surprise 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.519
 well I lost the door and here I have 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:23.020
 the raw fish that I'm going to eat but 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:26.520
 thing has prepared me a tupper 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.520
 I'll show what's inside 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:34.900
 there is a sushi sheet 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:37.180
 and rice so what I'm going to do is 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.810
 peel raw fish that is raw 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.810

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.510
 the sushi sheet 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.940
 rice 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.570
