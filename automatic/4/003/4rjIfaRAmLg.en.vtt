no matter how many times I push the
garnish<00:00:43.649> bar<00:00:43.860> thing<00:00:44.129> as<00:00:44.250> priority<00:00:44.820> I<00:00:45.390> thought

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
garnish bar thing as priority I thought

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.479 
garnish bar thing as priority I thought
it<00:00:46.140> said<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.440> in<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.680> intro<00:00:46.950> I<00:00:47.160> guess<00:00:47.340> the

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
it said it in the intro I guess the

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.250 
it said it in the intro I guess the
intros<00:00:47.760> are<00:00:47.910> different<00:00:48.210> now<00:00:48.329> so<00:00:48.570> I<00:00:48.809> guess<00:00:49.140> I'll

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
intros are different now so I guess I'll

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.869 
intros are different now so I guess I'll
just<00:00:49.289> repeat<00:00:49.680> it<00:00:49.710> if<00:00:50.129> you<00:00:50.309> publish<00:00:50.640> it<00:00:50.789> on

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
just repeat it if you publish it on

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.700 
just repeat it if you publish it on
garnish<00:00:51.510> bar<00:00:51.719> calm<00:00:52.079> you'll<00:00:52.260> have<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.440> faster

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
easier chance of getting it on the show

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.600 
easier chance of getting it on the show
quicker<00:00:54.989> until<00:00:55.890> at<00:00:56.010> least<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.190> end<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.399> summer

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.010 
stream I think we've had a total I don't
know<00:01:50.399> how<00:01:50.520> that<00:01:50.579> counts<00:01:50.909> 22<00:01:51.270> uniques<00:01:51.750> I'm

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
know how that counts 22 uniques I'm

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.740 
know how that counts 22 uniques I'm
guessing<00:01:52.409> 10<00:01:52.979> or<00:01:53.159> so<00:01:53.340> users<00:01:54.180> watching<00:01:54.450> at<00:01:54.659> the

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
guessing 10 or so users watching at the

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.270 
guessing 10 or so users watching at the
same<00:01:54.899> time<00:01:55.110> so<00:01:55.710> that's<00:01:55.829> pretty<00:01:56.070> impressive

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
same time so that's pretty impressive

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.920 
same time so that's pretty impressive
since<00:01:56.640> it's<00:01:56.759> our<00:01:56.850> first<00:01:57.000> time<00:01:57.299> doing<00:01:57.479> this<00:01:57.630> and

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
since it's our first time doing this and

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.510 
since it's our first time doing this and
it's<00:01:58.320> not<00:01:58.439> really<00:01:58.619> been<00:01:58.829> promoted<00:01:59.280> I

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
it's not really been promoted I

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.280 
it's not really been promoted I
twittered<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.360> I<00:02:00.390> put<00:02:00.659> on<00:02:00.750> Facebook<00:02:00.899> in

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
twittered it and I put on Facebook in

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.649 
twittered it and I put on Facebook in
YouTube's<00:02:02.189> post<00:02:02.850> area<00:02:03.119> but<00:02:03.360> I<00:02:03.390> don't<00:02:03.570> really

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
YouTube's post area but I don't really

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.050 
YouTube's post area but I don't really
know<00:02:03.840> what<00:02:03.930> that<00:02:03.960> means

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
know what that means

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.380 
know what that means
so

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
so

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.260 
so
it's<00:02:08.590> unfortunately<00:02:09.590> looks<00:02:10.369> very<00:02:10.820> similar<00:02:11.150> to

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
it's unfortunately looks very similar to

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.310 
it's unfortunately looks very similar to
yesterday's<00:02:11.780> cocktail<00:02:12.290> although<00:02:14.170> was<00:02:15.170> it

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
yesterday's cocktail although was it

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.970

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
maybe not this one I think it had a lot

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.460 
maybe not this one I think it had a lot
more<00:02:21.410> fizz<00:02:21.800> to<00:02:22.040> it<00:02:22.390> the<00:02:23.390> pucker<00:02:23.630> must<00:02:23.960> it

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
more fizz to it the pucker must it

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.070 
more fizz to it the pucker must it
reacts<00:02:24.830> a<00:02:24.950> little<00:02:25.100> differently<00:02:25.400> so<00:02:25.840> it<00:02:26.840> kind

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
reacts a little differently so it kind

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.720 
reacts a little differently so it kind
of<00:02:27.140> burns<00:02:27.350> out<00:02:27.620> and<00:02:27.770> it<00:02:27.830> makes<00:02:28.010> like<00:02:28.160> a<00:02:28.370> ton<00:02:28.700> of
