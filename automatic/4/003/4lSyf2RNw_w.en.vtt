to<00:00:25.470> know<00:00:25.650> this<00:00:26.390> number<00:00:27.390> one<00:00:27.750> rule<00:00:28.050> of<00:00:28.080> thumb<00:00:28.260> is

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
to know this number one rule of thumb is

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.420 
to know this number one rule of thumb is
you're<00:00:29.340> never<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:30.240> drain<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:30.929> vinyl<00:00:31.619> liner<00:00:31.890> pool

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
you're never to drain a vinyl liner pool

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.670 
you're never to drain a vinyl liner pool
whether<00:00:32.910> that's<00:00:33.239> in<00:00:33.510> ground<00:00:33.809> or<00:00:34.079> above<00:00:34.230> ground

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
whether that's in ground or above ground

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.880 
whether that's in ground or above ground
and<00:00:34.950> I'll<00:00:35.070> explain<00:00:35.550> why<00:00:35.989> the<00:00:36.989> way<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.200> liner<00:00:37.620> is

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
and I'll explain why the way a liner is

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.299 
and I'll explain why the way a liner is
designed<00:00:37.920> is<00:00:38.730> it's<00:00:39.420> cut<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.960> little<00:00:40.290> small<00:00:40.860> for

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
designed is it's cut a little small for

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.150 
designed is it's cut a little small for
the<00:00:41.399> pool<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:42.059> it<00:00:42.570> has<00:00:42.719> plasticize<00:00:43.649> within

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
the pool and it has plasticize within

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.680 
the pool and it has plasticize within
the<00:00:44.280> liner<00:00:44.520> that<00:00:44.850> allow<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.180> liner<00:00:45.539> to

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
the liner that allow the liner to

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.950 
the liner that allow the liner to
stretch<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.230> little<00:00:46.829> bit<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.250> fit<00:00:47.640> in<00:00:47.850> nice<00:00:48.149> okay

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
stretch a little bit to fit in nice okay

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.080 
stretch a little bit to fit in nice okay
well<00:00:49.770> what's<00:00:50.010> going<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.250> happen<00:00:50.610> is<00:00:50.760> once<00:00:50.969> you

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
well what's going to happen is once you

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.760 
well what's going to happen is once you
put<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.480> liner<00:00:51.750> in<00:00:51.989> there<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.289> first<00:00:52.320> time

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
put that liner in there the first time

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.250 
put that liner in there the first time
the<00:00:53.039> plasti<00:00:53.489> sides<00:00:53.730> are<00:00:53.969> very<00:00:54.000> pliable<00:00:54.690> and

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
the plasti sides are very pliable and

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.600 
the plasti sides are very pliable and
they're<00:00:55.379> going<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.620> stretch<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.309> everything

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
they're going to stretch and everything

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.270 
they're going to stretch and everything
is<00:00:56.670> going<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.879> be<00:00:56.940> fine<00:00:57.210> they<00:00:57.930> stretch<00:00:58.530> out<00:00:58.890> you

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
is going to be fine they stretch out you

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.340 
is going to be fine they stretch out you
fill<00:00:59.579> it<00:00:59.730> up<00:00:59.850> with<00:01:00.059> thousands<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:00.899> thousands

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
fill it up with thousands and thousands

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.869 
fill it up with thousands and thousands
of<00:01:01.410> pounds<00:01:01.590> of<00:01:01.829> water<00:01:02.010> weight<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.340> that<00:01:02.640> water

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
of pounds of water weight and that water

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.359 
of pounds of water weight and that water
weight<00:01:03.120> holds<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.539> liner<00:01:03.750> in<00:01:03.960> place<00:01:04.369> very

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
weight holds the liner in place very

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.700 
weight holds the liner in place very
quickly<00:01:05.850> after<00:01:06.390> that<00:01:06.420> liner<00:01:06.840> is<00:01:07.080> in<00:01:07.260> there<00:01:07.470> the

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
quickly after that liner is in there the

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.330 
quickly after that liner is in there the
plasti<00:01:08.250> sides<00:01:08.490> become<00:01:08.970> hard<00:01:09.299> like<00:01:09.659> any

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
plasti sides become hard like any

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.100 
plasti sides become hard like any
plastic<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.549> sits<00:01:11.850> in<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.060> weather<00:01:12.360> would

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
plastic that sits in the weather would

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.620 
plastic that sits in the weather would
become<00:01:13.409> hard<00:01:13.710> over<00:01:14.010> time<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.939> plasticize

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
become hard over time the plasticize

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.690 
become hard over time the plasticize
will<00:01:15.900> come<00:01:16.080> hard<00:01:16.380> when<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:16.860> drain<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.490> water

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
will come hard when you drain the water

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.200 
will come hard when you drain the water
out<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.900> liner<00:01:19.229> will<00:01:19.680> shrink<00:01:20.189> back<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.850> its

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
out the liner will shrink back to its

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.560 
out the liner will shrink back to its
original<00:01:21.830> undercut<00:01:22.830> size<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.790> the

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
original undercut size and the

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.780 
original undercut size and the
plasticize<00:01:25.350> at<00:01:25.680> this<00:01:25.860> point<00:01:26.159> will<00:01:26.400> now<00:01:26.580> be

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
plasticize at this point will now be

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.899 
plasticize at this point will now be
hard<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.900> liner<00:01:28.140> will<00:01:28.590> not<00:01:28.860> stretch<00:01:29.460> back

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
hard and the liner will not stretch back

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.210 
hard and the liner will not stretch back
out<00:01:30.240> when<00:01:30.810> you<00:01:30.960> fill<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.409> pool<00:01:31.619> up<00:01:31.950> those

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
out when you fill the pool up those

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.370 
out when you fill the pool up those
plasticize<00:01:32.970> want<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.509> allow<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.810> liner<00:01:34.229> to

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
plasticize want to allow the liner to

plasticize want to allow the liner to
stretch<00:01:34.799> back<00:01:35.040> up<00:01:35.369> so<00:01:36.090> seeing<00:01:36.509> as<00:01:36.659> though<00:01:36.840> the

the<00:01:48.780> liner<00:01:48.990> is<00:01:49.140> too<00:01:49.290> small<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.649> start<00:01:50.100> putting

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
the liner is too small you start putting

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.800 
the liner is too small you start putting
that<00:01:50.460> water<00:01:50.670> weight<00:01:51.000> in<00:01:51.210> there<00:01:51.420> it<00:01:51.540> starts

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
that water weight in there it starts

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.389 
that water weight in there it starts
getting<00:01:52.049> about<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.229> foot<00:01:52.530> of<00:01:52.649> water<00:01:52.680> in<00:01:53.009> it<00:01:53.310> or

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
getting about a foot of water in it or

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.219 
getting about a foot of water in it or
so<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:53.880> there's<00:01:54.000> so<00:01:54.210> many<00:01:54.420> thousand<00:01:54.930> pounds

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
so and there's so many thousand pounds

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.319 
so and there's so many thousand pounds
of<00:01:55.320> water<00:01:55.500> on<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:55.979> it's<00:01:56.490> going<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:56.820> number<00:01:57.030> one

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
going to want more liner so it's going

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.070 
going to want more liner so it's going
to<00:02:07.920> pull<00:02:08.280> from<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:08.970> top<00:02:09.000> of<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.539> pool<00:02:09.780> which

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970

what speeds up if you drain the pool out
what<00:02:54.620> speeds<00:02:55.100> up<00:02:55.400> that<00:02:55.640> shrinking<00:02:56.330> process<00:02:56.600> is

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
what speeds up that shrinking process is

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.620 
what speeds up that shrinking process is
going<00:02:58.010> to<00:02:58.250> be<00:02:58.400> the<00:02:58.550> heat<00:02:58.790> it's<00:02:59.240> going<00:02:59.420> to<00:02:59.540> be

going to be the heat it's going to be
the<00:02:59.750> Sun<00:02:59.990> okay<00:03:00.380> there's<00:03:00.590> some<00:03:00.830> times<00:03:01.100> during

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
the Sun okay there's some times during

have to drain somebody's pool down to
repair<00:03:06.650> something<00:03:07.010> so<00:03:07.340> this<00:03:07.460> is<00:03:07.640> how<00:03:07.760> we<00:03:07.820> do<00:03:08.120> it

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
repair something so this is how we do it
