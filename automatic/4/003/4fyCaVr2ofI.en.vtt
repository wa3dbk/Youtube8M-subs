00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:13.220 
left the trim and did the same exact

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:16.770 
left the trim and did the same exact
thing<00:06:13.490> that<00:06:13.730> I<00:06:13.850> did<00:06:14.150> here<00:06:14.780> with<00:06:15.200> the<00:06:15.460> adhesive

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:16.780

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:19.130 
but I rolled it into each other so you

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.100 
but I rolled it into each other so you
can<00:06:19.160> see<00:06:19.490> these<00:06:19.790> actually<00:06:20.150> would<00:06:20.270> work<00:06:20.450> really

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.110 
can see these actually would work really

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.240 
can see these actually would work really
nice<00:06:21.290> together<00:06:21.970> inside<00:06:22.970> of<00:06:23.060> each<00:06:23.180> other<00:06:23.330> so

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:24.250 
nice together inside of each other so

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:27.130 
nice together inside of each other so
yeah<00:06:25.250> that's<00:06:25.460> just<00:06:25.550> a<00:06:25.730> really<00:06:26.060> fun<00:06:26.540> again
