other<00:00:43.980> one<00:00:44.219> was<00:00:44.399> just<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.910> lighter<00:00:45.480> he<00:00:45.719> throw<00:00:45.989> it

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
other one was just a lighter he throw it

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.590 
other one was just a lighter he throw it
and<00:00:46.260> goes<00:00:49.670> it<00:00:50.670> required<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.300> have<00:00:51.480> an

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
environment that's a complementary to

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:54.889 
environment that's a complementary to
glide<00:00:53.820> diction<00:00:54.149> rubber<00:00:54.329> bands<00:00:54.600> you<00:00:54.719> take<00:00:54.870> a

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
glide diction rubber bands you take a

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.119 
glide diction rubber bands you take a
rubber<00:00:55.050> band<00:00:55.170> yeah<00:00:55.680> boomerang<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:57.980> but<00:00:58.980> yeah

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
rubber band yeah boomerang it but yeah

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.170 
rubber band yeah boomerang it but yeah
you<00:00:59.399> know<00:00:59.489> it's<00:00:59.609> not<00:00:59.699> practical

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
you know it's not practical

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.910 
you know it's not practical
gliders<00:01:00.629> aren't<00:01:00.899> practical<00:01:01.199> throughout<00:01:01.739> the

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
gliders aren't practical throughout the

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.640 
gliders aren't practical throughout the
nation<00:01:02.250> let's<00:01:02.489> just<00:01:02.670> say<00:01:02.820> in<00:01:03.000> these<00:01:03.090> flat

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650 
nation let's just say in these flat

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.980 
nation let's just say in these flat
plane<00:01:04.650> states<00:01:05.129> in<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.760> flat<00:01:06.210> Midwest<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:06.930> a

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
plane states in the flat Midwest and a

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.030 
plane states in the flat Midwest and a
lot<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.320> areas<00:01:07.530> where<00:01:07.590> we<00:01:07.710> fly<00:01:07.890> of<00:01:08.010> course

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
lot of the areas where we fly of course

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.830 
lot of the areas where we fly of course
we<00:01:08.369> need<00:01:08.490> some<00:01:08.729> way<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:08.909> get<00:01:09.060> them<00:01:09.180> up<00:01:09.270> there<00:01:09.479> so

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
we need some way to get them up there so

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.649 
we need some way to get them up there so
we<00:01:09.990> can<00:01:10.110> have<00:01:10.260> fun<00:01:10.409> with<00:01:10.560> yeah<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.420> that's<00:01:12.420> the

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
we can have fun with yeah and that's the

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.080 
we can have fun with yeah and that's the
whole<00:01:12.840> goal<00:01:12.869> with<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.260> hawk<00:01:13.560> IP<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.070> go<00:01:14.220> it's

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
whole goal with the hawk IP to go it's

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.630 
whole goal with the hawk IP to go it's
extremely<00:01:15.990> extremely<00:01:16.830> simple<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.520> assemble

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
extremely extremely simple to assemble

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.690 
extremely extremely simple to assemble
it's<00:01:18.479> not<00:01:19.110> even<00:01:19.350> it's<00:01:19.650> not<00:01:19.680> even<00:01:19.799> worthy<00:01:20.189> of<00:01:20.369> a

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
it's not even it's not even worthy of a

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
your wing is one piece you slip it

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.130 
your wing is one piece you slip it
through<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.700> fuselage<00:01:30.090> or<00:01:30.299> get<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:30.900> centered

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
through the fuselage or get it centered

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.609 
through the fuselage or get it centered
and<00:01:31.350> hook<00:01:32.009> up<00:01:32.100> your<00:01:32.250> radio<00:01:32.460> system<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:32.939> go<00:01:33.090> so

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
and hook up your radio system and go so

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:36.890 
and hook up your radio system and go so
