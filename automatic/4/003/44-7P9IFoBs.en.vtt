00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.889
 hello everyone welcome on frandroid 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.900
 so today I will introduce you 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.250
 the new motorola phone 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.020
 so he's not really new because 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.510
 we had seen in the united states 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.580
 it's the bike x so you have to know 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.410
 that he will arrive in France and more and even 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.449
 in europe on February 1st 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.670
 in open market is for example at 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.410
 amazon so at first it 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.840
 will obviously be in preorder 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.040
 so unlike the united states you 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.200
 probably know that we can use 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.640
 motorcycle maker in fact motorcycle make her say the 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.530
 ability to customize the 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.660
 telephone by choosing for example the 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.070
 color of the hull in France it will be 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.440
 not at all the case because you will have 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.110
 either the choice between the white model is 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.000
 between the black model in terms of design 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.070
 you may notice some 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.390
 resemblance to the bike I then have the 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.140
 motogp it's been available for some 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.710
 weeks in France 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.100
 the main difference that we see in 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.690
 the eye 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.609
 it is for example the speaker who 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.309
 is not it if you're on the same side but 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.979
 especially the texture on the back then 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.750
 precisely in terms of 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.580
 technical characteristics must be said 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.260
 we are not at the level in nexus 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.420
 but at the limit we will say it's not 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.369
 very serious so the processor is a s 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.310
 cut pro from qualcomm who is in 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.810
 double heart it is accompanied by 2 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.439
 gigas of ram and an internal memory of 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.780
 16 go 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.180
 so like the nexus like he did not 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.520
 no microsd card reader this one 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.500
 little tribute and access to the battery 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.509
 and is not possible 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.070
 for the sim card on the 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.740
 found on the side is grandma card 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.830
 micro-sim then on the bike I had 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.900
 precisely access to the hull but not 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.910
 but not on the drums here it's 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.770
 absolutely nothing is done since 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.240
 outdoors 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.460
 so if we look more specifically at the 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.950
 phone has on the front a screen of 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:54.720
 4.7 inches with a definition hd it's 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:56.130
 to say 1920's by 720 pixels on the 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.010
 before going to find for example a 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.660
 2 megapixel sensor with 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.300
 brightness and proximity sensors 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.590
 is on the bench a small microphone and in 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.580
 does this little mic it will be useful for 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.680
 a feature that I you 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.979
 will present just now then on the 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:14.880
 side we find the keys on off and 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.920
 volume on the bottom the micro usb 2.0 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.180
 which is both reloaded and 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.290
 transfer data from a 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.150
 computer for example 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.880
 so on that side we've already talked about it 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:28.530
 it's the micro sim card is on the 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:30.750
 on it is the 3.5mm jack on the 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.120
 back and a 10 megapixel photo sensor 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.850
 that we find with a flash and the 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.450
 speaker is here again the logo 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:41.010
 of motorola there is one more time 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.190
 micro so we will be interested now 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.850
 to the software part which is so under 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:50.220
 kitkat and more precisely the version 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.750
 4.4.2 so what to know with 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.180
 motorola is that since the company 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.160
 now belongs to google has one 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.890
 to an experience that is very very 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.769
 close to what we have basic for example 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.350
 on the desktop we notice the keys 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:07.920
 which are transparent and on the top 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.900
 notifications also actually this 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.420
 which is the strength of this bike g73 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.940
 main features then the 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.800
 first it's tied to the camera so he 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.480
 just do that and 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.580
 immediately the device application 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.650
 photo will launch and then it's the 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.660
 Same application as on the bike I have 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.489
 so honestly I do not find it 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.239
 terrible because it's not always 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.890
 very convenient 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.140
 in fact when we click on the screen 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.489
 it's inevitably to take a picture 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.049
 not always what we would like to do by 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:36.420
 example I would just like to do the 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:38.100
 focus is to be expected if it is there in 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.709
 do not we can with this bike I have it 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.020
 a little pity sorry with this bike x 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.540
 but necessarily it's the same 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:46.400
 application that on the bike g the other 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.780
 feature that is interesting and 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.700
 so I spoke to you earlier and 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.710
 that works with microphones this is the 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.330
 voice recognition then on the 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:55.910
 nexus and even on android phones 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:58.550
 in general you have to be in google there 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.470
 where he used voice recognition 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.490
 in fact the peculiarity of this moto hic 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.140
 it can be done to anyone 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.470
 what time even with the screen and in 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:18.140
 google yahoo hockey 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:19.160
 what is the weather we can do 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.890
 other research for example 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:30.470
 which google now lead me to 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:33.740
 eiffel tower and in fact we see precisely 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:36.380
 interaction with the entire ecosystem of 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:38.210
 google is here for example 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.520
 will launch the google maps on application 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:45.940
 can also turn of Alain which 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:45.940
 google where activates an alarm at noon 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.139
 here we see there are plenty of research that is 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.919
 in fact the same features as 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:58.050
 on google and yahoo 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:59.850
 knowing that of course because that 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.620
 works from the cloud and yes 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.090
 because this google feature there 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.669
 where she will only walk if you are 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:07.740
 connected to the internet does in fact have this 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:09.030
 google the wii will evolve without you 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.160
 need to make updates 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:13.320
 is by the way speaking of update 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.830
 be aware that the applications from 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.600
 motorola 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.400
 they are basically on google 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.110
 play and therefore there is no 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.300
 need to have to receive one so 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.040
 that is a classic update 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.540
 all done since the story flat and 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.070
 so it's much faster for 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.500
 correct the bugs or precisely 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:30.180
 add new features 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:32.190
 a third features these motorcycles 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:35.040
 assists that we also find on the 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:38.520
 motorcycle so I actually associate 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.930
 events to actions for example 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.310
 you're driving you want to launch 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.600
 the music you are in meeting you 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.690
 do not want us to call you that 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:46.889
 was relatively practical then the 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:49.050
 last feature 

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:51.960
 it works through this screen which 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:56.100
 is therefore wheel of 4.7 inches including 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:57.660
 which is called active notification like 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.400
 you can see them displayed here ca 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:02.100
 with the possibility to unlock 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:05.010
 but if I had notifications that me 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:07.110
 would see them then why 

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:09.360
 it is possible with this screen 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:10.380
 amoled simply because this 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.390
 screen technology 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:14.729
 it only consumes when the pixels 

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:17.729
 are off are on pardon and seen 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:19.380
 that blacks are off legem a 

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:21.900
 great energy saving and it's very 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:23.760
 smart from motorola de 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:25.110
 do that to conclude this taking into 

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:27.140
 hand it must be said that this bike x is 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:29.310
 really a very nice surprise 

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:31.650
 me the only flaw that I 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:33.479
 find its price so 429 euros 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:35.550
 so i hope that as in the usa 

00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:37.470
 they will make offers or buying 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:39.060
 this or that thing next to it will do 

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:40.530
 a small reduction for example I know 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.100
 that right now there is a caste skull that 

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:44.150
 is offered with 

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:46.160
 thank you all for watching this video 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:47.840
 do not hesitate if you have 

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.460
 questions knowing that we will have it very 

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.900
 soon in test at that time we 

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.560
 can really discover all 

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.120
 features 

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:55.810
 because there we had only a few 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:55.810
 minutes in hand
