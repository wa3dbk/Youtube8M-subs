00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.440
 (happy music) 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.470
 - Hello everyone, I am Mindy. 

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:14.600
 From "cute girl hairstyle". 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.460
 Today Rylan is here too, she will help me. 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.240
 Teach you how to make CGH separate hair bands. 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.740
 Now, before we start to make the tape, 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.010

 This way we know that you are watching and like it. 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.320
 Now start braiding the tape. 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.150
 Ok, you can see that I have already started. 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.210
 Initially separate the hair around the ears on both sides, 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.560
 And tie the rest of the hair into a ponytail. 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.660
 There is some distribution in front of her face, 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.723
 So I put the hair in front of this place 

00:00:39.723 --> 00:00:40.960
 Slightly wet a little. 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.430
 I will start from the ear side, 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.240
 Split a small strand of hair, 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.540
 When this hair is divided, 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.390
 I fixed it with a rubber band. 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.040
 I like to use the rubber band that matches her hair. 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.290
 This will hide better in the process we do. 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.420
 Now I will edit the second stock, 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.190
 It’s a little higher than the first stock, 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.950
 In the same way, it is fixed with rubber bands. 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.170
 Here we are about to start separating. 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.530
 We put the second share 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.250
 Divided into two parts. 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.800
 Take the first share and 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.770
 Pull it straight through the middle like this. 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.870
 Then you can take these hairs to the back, 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.240
 And fixed with a hair clip. 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.430
 So they are like being separated. 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.660
 Then we will compile the third share. 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.350
 Now our third share will contain 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.300
 The end of the first strand. 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.220
 Then I will repeat 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.830
 Almost the same steps, 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:46.560
 We will separate this stock, 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.260
 Take the ends of the second strand, 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.330
 Pull straight and use the clip to stay behind. 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:53.800
 Use a clip to separate it out, 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.431
 Then edit the fourth strand containing these ends. 

00:01:56.431 --> 00:01:58.390
 (happy music) 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:07.550
 When I compiled this last share, 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.680
 I will continue to separate it, 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.290
 And pass the previous strand through it, 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.160
 Just like we did before, 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.980
 But in this stock, at the end 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.930
 I will put them all together, 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.960
 Attach a rubber band here, 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.730
 Fix them together. 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.970
 Now, you will notice that I tied the rubber band 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.100
 Towards the back of the divider, 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:29.740
 Because I want them to be behind the forehead. 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.440
 You can spread the rest of your hair 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.240
 And clip some small clips, 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.100
 You can stick the scalp, 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.780
 And you should be able 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.110
 Hidden the last rubber band 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.590
 Below the hair. 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.720
 It’s done now, it looks great, 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.720
 But we will really take it to another level, 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.360
 The practice is to go back and pull the next one, 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.030
 That is, on the back part of the hair, 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.200
 By pulling the peace show 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.040
 Let it swell up. 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.353
 (happy music) 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.840
 The effect of this is to make it look good, 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.950
 Almost a bit like the effect of the crown, 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.520
 Just in the top of her head. 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.270
 Let's do the final rotation...
