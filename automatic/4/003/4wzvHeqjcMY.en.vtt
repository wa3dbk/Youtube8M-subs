it<00:02:54.800> does<00:02:55.100> have<00:02:55.280> force<00:02:55.550> feedback<00:02:55.820> which<00:02:56.750> is

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
it does have force feedback which is

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
official Xbox 360 steering wheel so I'm

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.050 
official Xbox 360 steering wheel so I'm
really<00:03:03.680> not<00:03:03.980> too<00:03:04.250> sure<00:03:04.280> of<00:03:04.610> how<00:03:04.700> the<00:03:04.760> force

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
really not too sure of how the force

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.000 
really not too sure of how the force
feedback<00:03:05.270> works<00:03:05.570> on<00:03:05.780> that<00:03:05.930> the<00:03:06.710> steering

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
feedback works on that the steering

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.320 
feedback works on that the steering
wheel<00:03:07.130> that<00:03:07.190> I<00:03:07.250> was<00:03:07.460> really<00:03:07.700> wanting<00:03:07.940> to<00:03:08.120> look

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
wheel that I was really wanting to look

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.790 
wheel that I was really wanting to look
it<00:03:08.630> is<00:03:08.930> it's<00:03:09.440> a<00:03:10.510> Logitech<00:03:11.510> G<00:03:11.810> 35<00:03:12.320> I<00:03:12.350> believe

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
it is it's a Logitech G 35 I believe

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.060 
it is it's a Logitech G 35 I believe
it's<00:03:13.280> like<00:03:13.570> 299<00:03:14.570> dollars<00:03:14.750> but<00:03:15.500> right<00:03:15.740> now<00:03:15.890> it's

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
it's like 299 dollars but right now it's

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.760 
it's like 299 dollars but right now it's
not<00:03:16.220> compatible<00:03:16.670> with<00:03:17.030> the<00:03:17.390> 360<00:03:18.140> it's<00:03:18.590> only

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:18.770 
not compatible with the 360 it's only

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:23.050 
not compatible with the 360 it's only
compatible<00:03:19.100> with<00:03:19.370> a<00:03:19.490> ps3<00:03:19.880> or<00:03:20.450> with<00:03:20.990> a<00:03:22.060> computer

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
compatible with a ps3 or with a computer

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.170 
compatible with a ps3 or with a computer
so<00:03:23.810> basically<00:03:24.140> it<00:03:24.530> is<00:03:24.590> a<00:03:24.770> USB<00:03:25.100> but<00:03:25.730> people<00:03:26.060> have

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
so basically it is a USB but people have

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.580 
so basically it is a USB but people have
tried<00:03:26.390> it<00:03:26.420> and<00:03:26.660> it<00:03:26.780> does<00:03:26.960> not<00:03:27.080> work<00:03:27.320> I've

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
tried it and it does not work I've

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.310 
tried it and it does not work I've
emailed<00:03:27.920> the<00:03:28.100> company<00:03:28.430> it's<00:03:28.550> not<00:03:28.730> compatible

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.080 
coming out for the 360 the nifty part

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.780 
coming out for the 360 the nifty part
about<00:03:36.380> that<00:03:36.650> is<00:03:36.860> that<00:03:37.190> instead<00:03:37.340> of<00:03:37.580> having

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
about that is that instead of having

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.970 
about that is that instead of having
this<00:03:38.090> shifter<00:03:38.480> right<00:03:38.600> here<00:03:38.870> you<00:03:39.650> actually

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
this shifter right here you actually

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.190 
this shifter right here you actually
have<00:03:40.130> a<00:03:40.160> separate<00:03:40.610> gearbox<00:03:41.120> so<00:03:41.720> you<00:03:41.780> can<00:03:42.020> mount

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
have a separate gearbox so you can mount

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.080 
have a separate gearbox so you can mount
this<00:03:42.440> on<00:03:42.650> the<00:03:42.680> table<00:03:42.890> you<00:03:43.550> come<00:03:43.670> out<00:03:43.790> your<00:03:43.910> gear

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
this on the table you come out your gear

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.450 
this on the table you come out your gear
back<00:03:44.240> gearbox<00:03:44.990> basically<00:03:45.500> here<00:03:45.950> here

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:46.460 
back gearbox basically here here

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:47.980 
back gearbox basically here here
wherever<00:03:46.730> you<00:03:46.940> want<00:03:47.120> it<00:03:47.180> on<00:03:47.270> either<00:03:47.420> side<00:03:47.720> so

and it's instead of just having a you

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.530 
and it's instead of just having a you
know<00:03:54.410> shift<00:03:54.740> up<00:03:54.950> shift<00:03:55.010> down<00:03:55.550> it<00:03:55.910> actually<00:03:56.210> is

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
know shift up shift down it actually is

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.930 
know shift up shift down it actually is
a<00:03:56.570> real<00:03:56.840> shifter<00:03:57.260> it<00:03:57.560> go<00:03:57.770> has<00:03:57.980> first<00:03:58.460> second

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
a real shifter it go has first second

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.970 
a real shifter it go has first second
and<00:03:59.030> then<00:03:59.330> to<00:03:59.810> get<00:03:59.930> in<00:04:00.050> the<00:04:00.140> third<00:04:00.380> you<00:04:00.740> got<00:04:00.860> to

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
and then to get in the third you got to

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.220 
and then to get in the third you got to
go<00:04:01.040> up<00:04:01.310> over<00:04:01.670> and<00:04:02.180> into<00:04:02.510> third<00:04:02.720> and<00:04:02.930> then<00:04:03.020> down

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
go up over and into third and then down

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:06.430 
go up over and into third and then down
the<00:04:03.380> fourth<00:04:03.620> up<00:04:03.860> over<00:04:04.790> and<00:04:05.060> up<00:04:05.360> for<00:04:06.110> the<00:04:06.200> fifth

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
the fourth up over and up for the fifth

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.530 
the fourth up over and up for the fifth
and<00:04:06.650> then<00:04:06.740> down<00:04:06.950> for<00:04:07.190> six<00:04:07.340> and<00:04:07.580> then<00:04:07.820> it<00:04:07.910> has<00:04:08.090> an

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
and then down for six and then it has an

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.090 
and then down for six and then it has an
over<00:04:08.959> and<00:04:09.110> down<00:04:09.260> forever<00:04:09.800> so<00:04:09.920> it's<00:04:10.040> a

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.100 
over and down forever so it's a

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.420 
over and down forever so it's a
six-speed<00:04:10.610> transmission<00:04:11.209> with<00:04:11.540> reverse<00:04:11.959> and

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
six-speed transmission with reverse and

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.920 
six-speed transmission with reverse and
it's<00:04:13.430> pretty<00:04:13.640> sweet<00:04:14.000> I<00:04:14.209> really<00:04:14.720> wanted

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
it's pretty sweet I really wanted

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.440 
it's pretty sweet I really wanted

acting like this clutch you have to push
the<00:04:56.850> clutch<00:04:57.030> in<00:04:57.090> so<00:04:57.570> your<00:04:57.690> car<00:04:57.870> doesn't<00:04:58.139> stall

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
the clutch in so your car doesn't stall

well on video games the feature doesn't
have<00:05:00.630> that<00:05:00.810> because<00:05:01.020> the<00:05:01.199> cars<00:05:01.410> can't<00:05:01.710> really

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:01.979 
have that because the cars can't really

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:04.430 
have that because the cars can't really
stall<00:05:02.280> on<00:05:02.430> games<00:05:02.699> so<00:05:03.389> that's<00:05:03.870> the<00:05:04.050> only
