nightmarish
but<00:02:02.610> it's<00:02:03.300> all<00:02:03.450> worth<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:03.840> because<00:02:03.899> I<00:02:04.560> look

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
but it's all worth it because I look

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.380 
but it's all worth it because I look
like<00:02:05.099> that<00:02:05.250> in<00:02:05.429> Tibet<00:02:05.729> for<00:02:05.910> that<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:06.209> that's

like that in Tibet for that and that's
been<00:02:06.629> printed<00:02:07.080> on<00:02:07.170> celluloid<00:02:07.649> forever<00:02:08.039> and

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
been printed on celluloid forever and

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:08.930 
been printed on celluloid forever and
ever

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940

there was really no time other than the

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.090 
there was really no time other than the
time<00:02:38.240> that<00:02:38.270> we<00:02:38.570> spent<00:02:38.900> on<00:02:39.080> the<00:02:39.380> film<00:02:39.590> set<00:02:39.890> it

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
time that we spent on the film set it

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.330 
time that we spent on the film set it

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
was so demanding at every level and we

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.750 
was so demanding at every level and we
would<00:02:43.459> have<00:02:43.610> really<00:02:43.910> long<00:02:44.300> hours<00:02:44.600> of<00:02:45.140> work<00:02:45.760> so

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
would have really long hours of work so

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.220 
would have really long hours of work so
even<00:02:46.970> when<00:02:47.090> we<00:02:47.209> finished<00:02:47.600> it's<00:02:47.780> not<00:02:47.959> like<00:02:48.080> we

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
even when we finished it's not like we

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
we did get to do was a good number of

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.820

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
workshops before we started shooting but

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.860 
workshops before we started shooting but
once<00:03:01.010> we<00:03:01.160> started<00:03:01.580> we<00:03:01.730> didn't<00:03:01.940> get<00:03:02.030> much<00:03:02.209> I<00:03:02.420> had

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
once we started we didn't get much I had

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.270 
once we started we didn't get much I had
to<00:03:02.989> get<00:03:03.140> to<00:03:03.230> Mordor<00:03:03.500> because<00:03:03.800> you<00:03:03.890> know<00:03:04.010> there

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
to get to Mordor because you know there

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.590 
to get to Mordor because you know there
is<00:03:04.489> a<00:03:05.050> there<00:03:06.050> is<00:03:06.080> a<00:03:06.230> certain<00:03:06.739> amount<00:03:06.980> of<00:03:07.480> it<00:03:08.480> is

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
is a there is a certain amount of it is

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.090 
is a there is a certain amount of it is
an<00:03:08.750> intense<00:03:09.050> love<00:03:09.260> story<00:03:09.530> you<00:03:09.680> have<00:03:09.770> to<00:03:09.890> work

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
an intense love story you have to work

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.190 
an intense love story you have to work
very<00:03:10.370> closely<00:03:10.670> with<00:03:10.910> the<00:03:11.420> degree<00:03:11.660> actor<00:03:12.020> cast

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
very closely with the degree actor cast

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.560 
very closely with the degree actor cast
opposite<00:03:12.650> you<00:03:12.830> so<00:03:13.400> it<00:03:13.670> was<00:03:13.820> important<00:03:14.360> to<00:03:14.420> get

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
opposite you so it was important to get

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:15.880 
opposite you so it was important to get
to<00:03:14.690> know<00:03:14.810> difficult<00:03:15.050> because<00:03:15.350> we<00:03:15.620> didn't<00:03:15.830> know

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
to know difficult because we didn't know

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.560 
to know difficult because we didn't know
each<00:03:16.010> other<00:03:16.130> before<00:03:16.670> we<00:03:16.880> started<00:03:17.300> work<00:03:17.450> on

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
each other before we started work on

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.860 
each other before we started work on
this<00:03:17.750> film<00:03:17.959> so<00:03:18.500> it<00:03:18.590> was<00:03:18.709> a<00:03:18.739> good<00:03:18.950> exercise<00:03:19.870> but

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
this film so it was a good exercise but

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.410 
this film so it was a good exercise but
but<00:03:21.650> yeah<00:03:21.800> I<00:03:21.830> mean<00:03:22.130> I'm<00:03:22.370> glad<00:03:22.580> that<00:03:22.940> people<00:03:23.120> are

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
but yeah I mean I'm glad that people are

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.780 
but yeah I mean I'm glad that people are
noticing<00:03:23.930> that<00:03:24.080> you<00:03:24.650> know<00:03:24.769> the<00:03:25.010> the<00:03:25.280> chemistry

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
noticing that you know the the chemistry

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.759 
noticing that you know the the chemistry
is<00:03:25.970> extra-special<00:03:26.420> which<00:03:26.930> I<00:03:27.080> in<00:03:27.320> my<00:03:27.500> own

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
is extra-special which I in my own

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.520 
is extra-special which I in my own
estimation<00:03:28.549> it<00:03:28.700> is<00:03:28.840> but<00:03:29.840> it's<00:03:29.989> imperative<00:03:30.260> for

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
estimation it is but it's imperative for

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.020 
estimation it is but it's imperative for
a<00:03:30.739> film<00:03:30.920> like<00:03:31.040> the<00:03:31.190> Omni<00:03:31.430> that<00:03:31.610> you<00:03:31.700> know<00:03:31.790> it<00:03:31.910> is

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
a film like the Omni that you know it is

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:44.540 
a film like the Omni that you know it is
the<00:03:32.150> driving<00:03:32.390> force<00:03:32.690> of<00:03:32.810> the<00:03:32.870> narrative

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.430 

what<00:03:45.150> did<00:03:45.239> you<00:03:45.330> discover<00:03:45.690> about<00:03:45.780> difficult<00:03:46.379> it

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
what did you discover about difficult it

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.559 
what did you discover about difficult it
was<00:03:46.530> pleasantly<00:03:47.099> surprising<00:03:47.540> when<00:03:48.540> I

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
was pleasantly surprising when I

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:49.820 
was pleasantly surprising when I
interviewed<00:03:48.989> here<00:03:49.080> with<00:03:49.200> Shahrukh<00:03:49.440> Khan<00:03:49.680> by

the way the entire interview he spent

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:52.610 
the way the entire interview he spent
just<00:03:51.450> complimenting<00:03:52.080> her<00:03:52.170> that<00:03:52.349> was<00:03:52.470> my

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
just complimenting her that was my

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.320 
just complimenting her that was my
entire<00:03:53.010> interview<00:03:53.489> all<00:03:53.640> ten<00:03:53.910> minutes<00:03:54.209> of

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
Coffman's for us you got to think of

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.830 
Coffman's for us you got to think of
something<00:03:56.519> original<00:03:56.819> there's<00:03:57.239> one<00:03:57.450> thing<00:03:57.690> I

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
something original there's one thing I
