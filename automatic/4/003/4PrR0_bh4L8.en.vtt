stream and I just started laughing

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.020 
stream and I just started laughing
because<00:01:06.900> I<00:01:07.140> had<00:01:07.290> absolutely<00:01:07.439> no<00:01:08.130> idea<00:01:08.159> the

funny thing is that the fine was
actually<00:01:10.530> easier<00:01:10.979> than<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.280> semi-final<00:01:11.909> I

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.000 
actually easier than the semi-final I
had<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.299> fight<00:01:12.479> that<00:01:12.630> alien<00:01:12.990> invasion<00:01:13.439> guy<00:01:13.590> but

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.020 
it was pretty pretty epic and I had a
lot<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:15.869> fun<00:01:16.080> there<00:01:16.259> was<00:01:16.619> ages<00:01:17.220> ago<00:01:17.280> though<00:01:17.610> but

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
lot of fun there was ages ago though but

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.190 
lot of fun there was ages ago though but
that<00:01:18.150> was<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.390> time<00:01:18.540> when<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:18.780> really<00:01:18.990> thought

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
that was the time when I really thought

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.960 
that was the time when I really thought
should<00:01:19.770> I<00:01:19.890> maybe<00:01:20.100> invest<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.490> bit<00:01:20.520> more<00:01:20.759> time

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
should I maybe invest a bit more time

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.340 
should I maybe invest a bit more time
into<00:01:21.270> trying<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.630> become<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:21.990> professional

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
into trying to become a professional

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.440 
into trying to become a professional
gamer<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:23.400> only<00:01:23.610> problem<00:01:23.880> was<00:01:24.090> that<00:01:24.150> at<00:01:24.420> that

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
gamer the only problem was that at that

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.660 
gamer the only problem was that at that
time<00:01:24.630> already<00:01:25.229> started<00:01:26.009> casting<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:26.610> I

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
time already started casting and I

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.219 
time already started casting and I
really<00:01:26.970> enjoy<00:01:27.240> casting<00:01:27.689> quite<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:27.930> lot<00:01:28.080> and

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
really enjoy casting quite a lot and

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.899 
really enjoy casting quite a lot and
always<00:01:28.439> did<00:01:28.799> so<00:01:29.280> I<00:01:29.310> had<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.579> make<00:01:29.729> that<00:01:29.759> choice

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
always did so I had to make that choice

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.520 
always did so I had to make that choice
if<00:01:30.270> I<00:01:30.329> really<00:01:30.540> want<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.689> become<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:30.990> caster<00:01:31.500> or

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
if I really want to become a caster or

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.350 
if I really want to become a caster or
professional<00:01:32.369> player<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:33.030> one<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.270> the

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
professional player and one of the

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.090 
professional player and one of the
problems<00:01:33.720> that<00:01:33.780> you<00:01:33.960> have<00:01:33.990> was<00:01:34.350> trying<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.950> be

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
problems that you have was trying to be

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.740 
problems that you have was trying to be
both<00:01:35.369> is<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:35.970> doesn't<00:01:36.180> really<00:01:36.299> work<00:01:36.420> out

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
both is that it doesn't really work out

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.420 
both is that it doesn't really work out
just<00:01:37.320> because<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.770> tournament's<00:01:38.250> that<00:01:38.369> you

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
just because the tournament's that you

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.100 
just because the tournament's that you
want<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.670> cast<00:01:39.000> also<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.600> tournament's<00:01:40.020> that

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
want to cast also the tournament's that

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.080 
want to cast also the tournament's that
you<00:01:40.200> want<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.470> play<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:40.950> it's<00:01:41.520> just

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
you want to play and it's just

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.090 
you want to play and it's just
impossible<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.810> become<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.170> cast<00:01:43.619> at<00:01:43.890> at<00:01:43.979> the

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
impossible to become a cast at at the

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.010 
impossible to become a cast at at the
same<00:01:44.280> time<00:01:44.460> also<00:01:44.700> professional<00:01:45.299> player<00:01:45.509> the

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
same time also professional player the

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.810 
same time also professional player the
only<00:01:46.320> thing<00:01:46.530> that<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:46.860> can<00:01:47.159> do<00:01:47.399> maybe<00:01:47.610> is

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
only thing that you can do maybe is

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.639 
only thing that you can do maybe is
every<00:01:48.420> now<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.720> then<00:01:48.810> jump<00:01:49.110> in<00:01:49.320> as<00:01:49.530> an

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
every now and then jump in as an

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.620 
every now and then jump in as an
analysis<00:01:50.189> if<00:01:50.399> you<00:01:50.520> are<00:01:50.670> player<00:01:51.030> but<00:01:51.450> that's

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
analysis if you are player but that's

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.690 
analysis if you are player but that's
already<00:01:51.990> about<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.979> also<00:01:53.130> have<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.460> admit

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
already about it and also have to admit

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.889 
already about it and also have to admit
that<00:01:53.820> I<00:01:53.939> think<00:01:54.270> there's<00:01:54.450> a<00:01:54.540> couple<00:01:54.689> of<00:01:54.840> things

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
that I think there's a couple of things

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.560 
that I think there's a couple of things
missing<00:01:55.619> from<00:01:55.649> me<00:01:55.979> or<00:01:56.130> my<00:01:56.729> personal<00:01:56.790> attitude

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
missing from me or my personal attitude

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.240 
missing from me or my personal attitude
when<00:01:57.780> it<00:01:58.049> comes<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.439> becoming<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.920> professional

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
when it comes to becoming a professional

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.280 
when it comes to becoming a professional
player<00:01:59.640> I<00:01:59.880> think<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.390> professional<00:02:00.899> player<00:02:01.079> has

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
player I think a professional player has

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.990 
player I think a professional player has
to<00:02:01.409> have<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.560> certain<00:02:01.680> mindset<00:02:02.159> when<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:02.759> comes

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
to have a certain mindset when it comes

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.030 
to have a certain mindset when it comes
to<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.450> gaming<00:02:03.750> approach<00:02:04.049> that<00:02:04.530> I<00:02:04.560> simply

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
to the gaming approach that I simply

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.830 
to the gaming approach that I simply
don't<00:02:05.159> have<00:02:05.310> I'm<00:02:05.670> too<00:02:05.820> emotional<00:02:06.060> going<00:02:06.630> into

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
don't have I'm too emotional going into

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.080 
don't have I'm too emotional going into
games<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.320> that<00:02:08.009> is<00:02:08.190> definitely<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:08.910> downside

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
games and that is definitely a downside

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.330 
games and that is definitely a downside
so<00:02:09.810> if<00:02:10.110> you<00:02:10.229> are<00:02:10.349> playing<00:02:10.649> you<00:02:10.950> need<00:02:11.069> to<00:02:11.220> be

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
so if you are playing you need to be

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.830 
so if you are playing you need to be
able<00:02:11.430> just<00:02:11.849> like<00:02:12.000> calm

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
able just like calm

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.690 
able just like calm
calmly<00:02:13.140> analyze<00:02:13.620> your<00:02:13.800> losses<00:02:14.010> make<00:02:14.519> sure

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
calmly analyze your losses make sure

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.550 
calmly analyze your losses make sure
that<00:02:14.970> in<00:02:15.090> every<00:02:15.209> single<00:02:15.599> situation<00:02:15.780> you<00:02:16.349> keep

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
that in every single situation you keep

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.869 
that in every single situation you keep
a<00:02:16.590> cool<00:02:16.800> head<00:02:16.860> and<00:02:17.220> that<00:02:17.489> you're<00:02:17.610> always

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
a cool head and that you're always

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:19.250 
a cool head and that you're always
trying<00:02:18.150> to<00:02:18.330> find<00:02:18.360> for<00:02:18.810> a<00:02:18.840> way<00:02:18.959> to<00:02:18.989> come<00:02:19.230> back

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
trying to find for a way to come back

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.320 
trying to find for a way to come back
into<00:02:19.590> the<00:02:19.739> game<00:02:19.890> and<00:02:20.099> I<00:02:20.430> personally<00:02:20.819> find<00:02:21.090> that

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
into the game and I personally find that

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.210 
into the game and I personally find that
pretty<00:02:21.480> tricky<00:02:21.930> and<00:02:22.140> any<00:02:22.410> other<00:02:22.620> vector<00:02:22.830> than

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
pretty tricky and any other vector than

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.220 
pretty tricky and any other vector than
already<00:02:23.550> I<00:02:23.790> always<00:02:24.000> had<00:02:24.239> like<00:02:24.360> a<00:02:24.420> competitive

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
already I always had like a competitive

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.979 
already I always had like a competitive
streak<00:02:25.500> to<00:02:25.739> me<00:02:25.860> and<00:02:26.190> really<00:02:26.910> am<00:02:27.180> I<00:02:27.209> think

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
streak to me and really am I think

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.140 
streak to me and really am I think
competitive<00:02:28.560> person<00:02:28.769> but<00:02:29.400> it's<00:02:29.580> not<00:02:29.910> really

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
competitive person but it's not really

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.089 
competitive person but it's not really
in<00:02:30.360> gaming<00:02:30.750> and<00:02:30.840> that's<00:02:31.290> really<00:02:31.530> a<00:02:31.680> part<00:02:31.950> way<00:02:32.069> I

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
in gaming and that's really a part way I

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:33.650 
in gaming and that's really a part way I
just<00:02:32.340> said<00:02:32.489> all<00:02:32.519> right<00:02:32.640> professional<00:02:33.390> player

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
think that as a player I would have

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.000 
think that as a player I would have
gotten<00:03:51.660> the<00:03:51.840> chance<00:03:51.989> to<00:03:52.169> do<00:03:52.319> that<00:03:52.530> so<00:03:52.950> I'm

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
gotten the chance to do that so I'm

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.940 
gotten the chance to do that so I'm
pretty<00:03:53.160> happy<00:03:53.280> with<00:03:53.519> my<00:03:53.639> choice<00:03:54.000> there<00:03:54.690> was<00:03:54.840> a

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
pretty happy with my choice there was a

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.960 
pretty happy with my choice there was a
small<00:03:55.950> moment<00:03:56.400> where<00:03:56.519> really<00:03:56.549> thought<00:03:56.940> about

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
small moment where really thought about

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.339 
small moment where really thought about
like<00:03:57.389> maybe<00:03:57.630> trying<00:03:57.989> to<00:03:58.079> become<00:03:58.319> a

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349 
like maybe trying to become a

00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:59.990 
like maybe trying to become a
professional<00:03:58.769> player<00:03:59.250> but<00:03:59.459> I<00:03:59.489> think<00:03:59.790> I<00:03:59.849> made
