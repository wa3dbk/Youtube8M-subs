00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.449

 I spoke games which is higher on 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.320
 nintendo which we thought with friends on 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.780
 our dandy 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.430
 seems to be simple concretes but remember 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.970

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:33.180
 turtles will play 5 place bucks oh and 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.130
 This game is my top 30 best games on 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.229
 in fact, the game is not very popular 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.970
 because it came out at the dawn of nintendo when 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.570
 most came already on the console 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.550
 next generation 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.860
 and it's sad because this is one of the best 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.479
 games on dendy generally super 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.970
 varied gameplay and level 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.530
 characters seems their skill and 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.660
 just cool music 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.270
 if not played but love dandy 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.740
 be sure to try 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.960
 fourth place contra I think everything 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.180
 played counter my favorite part counter 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.340
 hartford sega mega drive presence 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.650
 my top 30 but the rest of the series 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.200
 Oktay not much in the game mad drive 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.090
 Hartford the opportunity to play together I 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.570
 sure that everyone should play this 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.570
 series 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.760
 third place metal gear solid series 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.220
 hideo kojima writes a beautiful script 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.860
 for my games I beat all games 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.720
 the series did not find a single one that is bad 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.850
 certain disadvantages but when you 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.980
 you start to feel the atmosphere of the plot 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.080
 also you don't notice how you look at the final 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.390
 credits first part of metal gear series 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.910

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.120
 parts have a wonderful plot atmosphere and 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.100
 sense of fear plus akira yamaoka 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.380
 wrote the finest machine with these 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.769

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.660
 2 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:51.400
 I think that I am one of the most 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.739
 touching and shocking scenes 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.069
 computer games, I advise everyone to play 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.280
 by these 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:01.069
 in the second first place is a series of castlevania 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:04.040

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.010
 gameplay and timpaniya takes it up 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.170
 unique 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.329
 every time I find something new in the castle 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.569
 draculae yes there are a series and worthy 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:16.250

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:19.629
