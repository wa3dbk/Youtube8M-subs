00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.860 
between the two cans an additional piece
that<00:03:25.800> I<00:03:25.830> did<00:03:26.100> not<00:03:26.310> show<00:03:26.640> is<00:03:26.880> that<00:03:26.940> I<00:03:27.239> cut<00:03:27.540> out<00:03:27.690> an

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
that I did not show is that I cut out an

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.770 
that I did not show is that I cut out an
additional<00:03:28.380> piece<00:03:28.650> of<00:03:28.920> fiberglass<00:03:29.370> to<00:03:30.300> put<00:03:30.570> in

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
additional piece of fiberglass to put in

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.979 
additional piece of fiberglass to put in
just<00:03:31.530> underneath<00:03:32.150> the<00:03:33.150> other<00:03:33.360> layer<00:03:33.750> of

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
just underneath the other layer of

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.979 
just underneath the other layer of
fiberglass<00:03:34.410> this<00:03:35.370> creates<00:03:35.850> a<00:03:36.090> nice<00:03:36.330> tight

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
fiberglass this creates a nice tight

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.360 
fiberglass this creates a nice tight
seal<00:03:37.500> over<00:03:38.209> the<00:03:39.209> grommet<00:03:39.900> so<00:03:40.380> that<00:03:40.590> alcohol

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
seal over the grommet so that alcohol

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.210 
seal over the grommet so that alcohol
cannot<00:03:41.880> leak<00:03:42.150> out<00:03:42.390> if<00:03:42.660> they<00:03:43.019> can<00:03:43.709> is<00:03:43.950> knocked

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
cannot leak out if they can is knocked

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.770 
cannot leak out if they can is knocked
over<00:03:46.760> with<00:03:47.760> all<00:03:47.910> of<00:03:48.030> your<00:03:48.150> insulation

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
over with all of your insulation

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.259 
over with all of your insulation
installed<00:03:49.140> into<00:03:49.739> the<00:03:49.890> can<00:03:50.220> now<00:03:50.790> you<00:03:50.850> can

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
installed into the can now you can

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.110 
installed into the can now you can
gently<00:03:51.989> take<00:03:52.440> another<00:03:52.860> piece<00:03:53.160> of<00:03:53.400> a<00:03:53.549> can<00:03:53.820> and

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
gently take another piece of a can and

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.930 
gently take another piece of a can and
run<00:03:54.420> it<00:03:54.510> around<00:03:54.750> the<00:03:54.930> edges<00:03:55.110> this<00:03:56.040> will<00:03:56.340> make<00:03:56.910> a

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
run it around the edges this will make a

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.210 
run it around the edges this will make a
nice<00:03:57.209> tight<00:03:57.660> fit<00:03:57.690> it<00:03:58.170> takes<00:03:58.709> a<00:03:58.829> little<00:03:58.950> bit<00:03:59.130> of

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
nice tight fit it takes a little bit of

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.300 
nice tight fit it takes a little bit of
time<00:03:59.430> and<00:03:59.730> might<00:04:00.480> take<00:04:00.660> a<00:04:00.720> few<00:04:00.840> efforts<00:04:01.440> but

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
time and might take a few efforts but

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.370 
time and might take a few efforts but
once<00:04:02.549> you<00:04:02.700> get<00:04:02.850> it<00:04:02.940> all<00:04:03.090> level<00:04:03.600> the<00:04:03.930> can<00:04:04.170> will
