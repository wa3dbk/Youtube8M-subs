00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.170 
next was Mark and he danced to Black
Betty<00:04:27.520> by<00:04:28.420> ram<00:04:28.870> jam<00:04:28.920> I<00:04:29.920> didn't<00:04:30.700> think<00:04:30.730> it

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
Betty by ram jam I didn't think it

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.290 
Betty by ram jam I didn't think it
really<00:04:31.420> showcased<00:04:32.140> his<00:04:32.620> abilities<00:04:33.370> no<00:04:33.850> well

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
really showcased his abilities no well

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.880 
really showcased his abilities no well
he<00:04:34.450> probably<00:04:34.690> figured<00:04:34.840> I'm<00:04:35.260> not<00:04:35.320> gonna<00:04:35.530> spend

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:35.890 
he probably figured I'm not gonna spend

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:37.650 
he probably figured I'm not gonna spend
a<00:04:36.130> lot<00:04:36.280> of<00:04:36.310> time<00:04:36.460> on<00:04:36.850> this<00:04:36.970> because<00:04:37.240> it's<00:04:37.600> not

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
a lot of time on this because it's not

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.870 
a lot of time on this because it's not
gonna<00:04:37.960> that's<00:04:38.560> true<00:04:38.860> you<00:04:39.340> know<00:04:39.460> it's<00:04:39.760> not

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
gonna that's true you know it's not

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.310 
gonna that's true you know it's not
gonna<00:04:40.030> make<00:04:40.210> a<00:04:40.270> difference<00:04:40.330> anyone<00:04:41.050> if<00:04:41.200> you're

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
gonna make a difference anyone if you're

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:42.660 
gonna make a difference anyone if you're
leaving<00:04:41.470> you<00:04:41.830> want<00:04:42.010> to<00:04:42.070> go<00:04:42.130> out<00:04:42.250> with<00:04:42.310> a<00:04:42.430> bang

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:42.670 
leaving you want to go out with a bang

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:45.210 
leaving you want to go out with a bang
you<00:04:43.300> do<00:04:43.510> but<00:04:43.870> I<00:04:44.170> think<00:04:44.440> he'd<00:04:44.830> rather<00:04:44.860> spend

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
you do but I think he'd rather spend

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.010 
you do but I think he'd rather spend
some<00:04:45.520> more<00:04:45.640> time<00:04:45.700> on<00:04:46.150> his<00:04:46.330> other<00:04:46.480> dances

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
some more time on his other dances

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.630 
some more time on his other dances
probably<00:04:47.940> so<00:04:48.940> then<00:04:49.150> Carrington<00:04:50.160> dance<00:04:51.160> to<00:04:51.460> my

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:51.640 
probably so then Carrington dance to my

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:56.580 
probably so then Carrington dance to my
philosophy<00:04:52.420> by<00:04:52.690> inner<00:04:54.240> again<00:04:55.240> not<00:04:55.750> one<00:04:56.320> of<00:04:56.440> her
