00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:07.230
 so hello everyone and this again 

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:10.769
 my metal detector is a pirate and so now 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:14.419
 I show that I redid the changes of course 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.640
 so all the little things well, here I am 

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:19.730
 hot melt contact 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:23.240
 place closed up lead wires 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:25.640
 so that the battery does not come off 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:29.900
 so as not to wound too 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:33.900
 hot melt glue so here it is output to the potato 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:41.090
 I concluded here and so to include 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:44.040
 so now I will show here he plug I did 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:47.310
 here and had to bend it a little but it 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:51.380
 garbage here is a wire thick as they say 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:57.830
 manual for the assembly of this metal detector 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:01:03.720
 stayed solder so what else did 

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:07.140
 so now we remove it all the same shorter here 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.790
 only hot melt glue pampered in 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.380
 general speaker is up but all 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:18.210
 more reliably sat and so on 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.040
 such a cap and here it is another one 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.159
 cap 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:25.070
 so here sold an hour here it is this 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.510
 cap 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.810
 where did I get 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.640
 in short was a big barrel full of 30 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.190
 liter white she was so red 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:39.830
 cover but there are still edges like that were 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:43.140
 In general, I heated the knife and cut everything 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:46.620
 Here on 2 cover means that I want 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:50.340
 do now warm me up 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.510
 gun melting in the general level 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:59.970
 here 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:02:05.940
 lay shorter hole shorter overall 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:08.540
 so here and everything is close to work 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:12.930
 the coil is so tight 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:15.780
 everything will be fine so still a little bit and 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:19.140
 bar remade those who watched mine 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:22.440
 previous videos here is a stand she 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:25.290
 here was the length of the pen itself 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.500
 Now the bark was longer in length and 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:32.340
 here this stand was somewhere here 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:35.489
 I made a shorter pen like this 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:40.620
 rests wrist somewhere wrist so 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:41.910
 that's so convenient to be well, that's all for now 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:47.060
 so well here 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:51.650
 Gulf sealant here from the inside smaller 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:56.250
 with outdoor seal more accurate sealant 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:58.050
 hot glue everything seems to be holding now 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.560
 now will make the top slots 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:04.500
 cover and invent a mechanism to 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.080
 to hook up to the rod itself this coil 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.980
 to all shtangovoy collapsible 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.900
 I like more in this cover made February 2 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.090
 slotted 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:21.200
 cut out here such figures from 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:23.730
 PCB here is this whole part 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.890
 forgot to take a picture before 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.890
 already did everything to disassemble he did not 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:32.070
 shorter here with hot melt and here I did 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:35.910
 for reliability so as not to dangle well 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:37.710
 the hole here is manually twisted with a knife so well 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:42.360
 here so here to do stronger here 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:46.470
 I made almost exactly as they move 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:51.660
 will be fastened right here 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:53.640
 at an angle so that the slope was and so here 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:57.690
 here will be fastened large 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:04:00.330
 plastic bolton in general well 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.370
 folding the coil so probably not 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:05.700
 you will have to shoot every time 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:08.640
 if you have to sort it out well in general 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:12.239
 better to make out than the whole 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:15.600
 metal detector to drag so we now 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:16.290
 all here, too, will continue a few 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.940
 pieces 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:23.580
 I do not know perhaps more accurately chipboard hardboard to in 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:27.560
 order a carriage to not chase away 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:31.560
 nothing backlash well and here these seams need 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:33.900
 do the same with hot melt 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.270
 then I clean it but it's probably electrical tape 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.639
 we roll around in circles 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:42.960
 I will not bother anymore 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:48.389
 and so here I collected everything completely so 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:50.699
 appearance ok here you will need 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:56.610
 Sign roughly setting softly settings 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:05:00.960
 and on off so often glue the plug all 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:04.229
 normally smeared with hot melt it did 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:07.529
 barbell to disconnect to wear with 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:10.050
 it was possible so well here here 

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:12.479
 It turned out so hard you do not know 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:16.199
 wrinkled here put it really selling a lot 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:19.889
 all in solder as here so here all 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:22.409
 lego everything is fine a little bit of bars goes 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:26.819
 here you can make the corner higher 

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:28.770
 more to do so here on screed all 

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:31.919
 sealant missed all completely 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:34.740
 tight every hole in general everything 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:38.029
 missed even the end of the tape that's made 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:40.110
 for so to speak for greater reliability and 

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:45.439
 so well , that's all 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:45.439
 with this seeker i'm done bye
