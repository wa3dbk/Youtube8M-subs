00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.570
 hey people crime ixia and sincerely 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.610
 Welcome to the 22nd station of the 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.590
 webcast advent calendar I guess 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.880
 meanwhile after 21 little animals is likely 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.960
 each one of you has papers 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.880
 system at the advent calendar 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.960
 So it works in the course of the video 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.550
 will definitely be a letter 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.019
 and then you have to show them 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.890
 just with the help of the other videos in 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.300
 which of course also letters 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.470
 put together and put that together 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.570
 solution word you must then andy reid 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.610
 Send kastl and then you can just 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.350
 win a prize from the far cast 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.760
 gewinnspiel definitely exactly 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.480
 there is an announcement video and in the 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.800
 video description 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.120
 In any case, I have a pretty long time 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.559
 what am I thinking about now? 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.300
 make video is there is actually 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.460
 long ago want to do on a canal 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.780
 but it was the temporal skin and me 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.010
 actually do not make a last time 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.300
 and because of this one video i wanted 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.649
 now no let's play anymore 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.940
 That's why I thought I was doing 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.800
 a comment to a pretty 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.670
 current topic and indeed to network 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.379
 I think most of you 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.820
 should have heard it the matter 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.980
 with unplayed that now he just his 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.230
 both channels shut down because he just from 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.559
 suppressed his network media force 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.090
 has been 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.799
 and that's why I thought so 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.270
 now talk about networks and 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.150
 my experiences and also to 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.200
 So everything played around the topic 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.640
 start playing around with 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.140
 maybe for those who like it too 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.670
 not heard but I believe alarm 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.439
 is with and get the youth 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.759
 played at its one channel 1.3 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.170
 million subscribers and on the other 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.189
 the 800,000 subscribers are up 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.140
 every case a really big youtube 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.390
 and this will be his from his network 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.979
 media power has not suppressed money 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.810
 gets or videos were deleted so 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.770
 right choice meter force and 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.840
 That's why he has decided now 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.280
 to shut down his two channels because he 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.200
 just this fun this no more money 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.880
 wants to take off and is now on one 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.200
 new channel the channel so the new one 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.240
 Channels , of course, did not fit 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.560
 There he continues his videos left 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.579
 I can do that too and in the video 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.780
 description pack but as I said 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.780
 guess most of them are 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.820
 have heard so and yes as the name 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.470
 from this of this series already says 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.140
 kast advents I am just now 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.979
 in the networks and I have to completely 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.329
 I honestly say I am actually 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.310
 quite happy with the current 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.140
 network and so if the youtube 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.979
 side and he does not have any Beck then 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.240
 i can give you this in any case 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.219
 recommend and I say this is not only 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.570
 because in my contract and everything 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.390
 Definitely quite familiar 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.979
 I can say that network 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.690
 still relatively small and young that would like 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.130
 say and maybe it's a lot 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.510
 not quite perfect because it just one more 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.800
 pretty small and young network is 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.940
 but is definitely quite family 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.130
 and if you need support then 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.360
 you always get his help and up 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.440
 now everything has worked out so well 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.640
 I was at least not yet 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.930
 shitty from the network and that's why 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.800
 I can actually use this network 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.060
 just say good things and what I like about it 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.590
 I know you really can 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.330
 only his people are definitely watching 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.680
 what signs here because that was also 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.120
 The thing with played around he has just 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.410
 at meta power I guess the tenant 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.209
 power is normal that you are such a two 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.440
 years of contract enjoyment and believe me 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.180
 People two years on youtube is 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.920
 really a fixed long time i am 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.190
 now in my main channel one year up 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.570
 youtube so almost a year and I have 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.760
 in this one year now 50,000 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.989
 made subscribers and it is one year 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.790
 really a really long time up 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:51.410
 But youtube has never happened and 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.640
 Of course, two years later 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.750
 longer and that means if you really 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.769
 a contract with two years 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.540
 I can really sign that 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:58.130
 recommend unless you are already relative 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.330
 long in the network in there then it is 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.900
 Of course something different so it already has 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.340
 five times 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.780
 you have, for example, in a network 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.920
 already renewed the contract five times and 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.150
 you are still satisfied then you can 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.650
 you do that, of course, but still 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.030
 I can really recommend it in case 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.530
 youtuber are definitely going 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.140
 Never contract because you 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.310
 I know what happens 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.890
 I can say I was already one 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.269
 Another network with the name Koers is 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.470
 also a very good network 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:20.090
 can not give much bad 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.049
 say with me, however, was simply the 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.910
 thing that is an American 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:23.959
 network is and therefore no 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.519
 bock on it I definitely wanted in 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.690
 a german network because of that too 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:28.100
 always the thing with the support me 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.290
 why do you even go in? 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.000
 a network and just because you have the 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.410
 support because you want with the people 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.940
 may want to talk about benefits 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.709
 one just wants to enjoy one 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.000
 can create network when you are in a 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:38.720
 American network is it is 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.760
 of course always a bit 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.870
 complicated because when you look 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.980
 news writing because you have to 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.200
 maybe wait twelve hours because 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.310
 just the supporter is sleeping and then 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.079
 Of course it's always such a thing 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:49.220
 also if you get space street 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:50.690
 then in another country is the 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.980
 Legal situation completely different and that is 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.510
 then, of course, even more complicated 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.160
 means I am satisfied in any case 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.720
 there in a german network but me 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.670
 Guess everyone has to do this for themselves 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.530
 yes people know that are definitely 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.880
 so my stuff to a network and 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.200
 yes as I said only know such a small 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.700
 video because I just did not know what 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.019
 I should still do it is also natural 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.670
 always that i liked this video 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:08.750
 when it fills your room on the 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.890
 like button a tank to me yes 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.510
 maybe even more detailed 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.040
 make the video over networks 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.290
 and yes, then I would say until then 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.639
 had people and I hope you have the 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.090
 letters recognized and then another 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:19.090
 Merry Christmas
