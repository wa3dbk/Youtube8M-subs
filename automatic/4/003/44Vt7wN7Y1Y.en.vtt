00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.199
 good hello to all guys and welcome back 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:16.930
 in this new video I am Carlofortina 

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:18.880
 of the staff of the last fifa italia e team 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.849
 today we are something more player than diego 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.279
 it costs sif player of the chelsea spanish 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:26.380
 who has earned this version yes 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:29.470
 does doing games throughout the season 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:32.920
 fantastic and it is known that it is one of the 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.839
 most decisive players in the premier league 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.930
 but also in everything around the world here 

00:00:34.839 --> 00:00:41.350
 then we say very good values ​​for him 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:44.140
 84 speed 89 of pass 68 pass 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.549
 83 of dribbling 44 of defense and 90 of 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.470
 physical 

00:00:45.549 --> 00:00:50.320
 then let's start talking about speed 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:51.640
 speed I liked and it is not me 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.190
 liked 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.890
 acceleration omitted from the cons 81 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.400
 only the first two three steps succeed 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:03.309
 he won't be able to do much 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:06.159
 fluidly very quickly then 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:08.470
 put among the counter however outdated those 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:11.159
 the first two three meters he will do with 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.330
 those 87 quick steps will succeed 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.610
 fantastically to penetrate into the 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:18.450
 defenses thanks also that 86 of 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:22.510
 ball control that makes hybrid precisely 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:25.840
 easy to say so is that 89 that 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:28.390
 reflections which also makes it faster 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.300
 displacement of the ball between one foot and 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.830
 the other one is still keeps the 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.300
 ball glued to the feet then below 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.000
 I cannot say this point of view 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.100
 nothing but applauding it 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.470
 then we talk about dribbling three 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.940
 stars skill versus why really 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:46.750
 those few skills he can do 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:49.659
 I am very complicated because he only has 66 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.430
 of agility and 65 of balance ok the 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:54.000
 Reflex blade control will help you 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:58.210
 do not ooze but still free yourself 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.130
 when it has to run a lot even if me 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.250
 I just connect to the shot he won't have to 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:05.170
 always runs so much because with that 93's 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.330
 positioning and highlighting work 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.090
 average he will always find himself there 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.459
 limit areas of the area to receive 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.010
 the ball maybe do 23 dreaming 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:17.470
 or download it immediately in the door 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.640
 as you can see here are almost all 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:23.410
 equal goals 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:25.870
 are caught take the ball he runs into 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.900
 speed and then download it in the door 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.700
 because with that 97 of finalization not 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.580
 I can say anything else that puts them all 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.320
 inside if not sometimes a few 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.850
 small of left but nothing of that 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:40.060
 in fact the four-star weak foot 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:42.190
 I'm definitely a pro 88 of power 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.720
 shooting this thing also helps the fact 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.170
 he put it all in as 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.510
 he arrives in the area shoots a bomb and if 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.940
 he doesn't go in. He breaks the goalkeeper's hands 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.190
 shoots from the distance threshing floor 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.200
 I didn't put in the three planet rai against 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.000
 a league certainly needed a striker 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.200
 will therefore not be able to claim from 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.700
 he who also makes us goals by 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.060
 launched even if I did one 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.400
 crazy that you will come towards the end is 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.110
 the only thing that I think was 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.880
 quite improved from towards the beginning 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.860
 really in the nick version you couldn't 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.420
 just get it out here if you try 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:17.530
 maybe you go a lot to commit the 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:19.420
 goalkeeper rarely among the goals however a 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.390
 corner kick and always put it because 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.790
 it's out it's really hard to pull 87 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.650
 shooting value that in the sights 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.480
 plus it passes very much in the background a 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.120
 sincerely with diego costa i don't have 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.250
 often pulled on the fly since he 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.230
 he prefers to play ball on the ground too 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.549
 if he has a beautiful header 81 of 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.860
 penalty I turned two I scored 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:40.120
 two as you can easily see 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.040
 from Egypt 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.900
 the physical the physical was another gift 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.690
 that I liked too much costs alive 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:49.989
 in fact it is an absolute pro with 93 of 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:52.510
 physical strength 91 of aggressiveness 87 of 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.190
 stamina resistance so it will get tired 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.370
 really hardly since he is not 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:59.739
 the attacker who must run like a 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.120
 damn for maybe dribla if everyone is 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:04.480
 which is not the playmaker but is the 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.890
 here is the realizer then we have a 90's 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.950
 precision head shot his 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:11.320
 I didn't love my head too much because yes 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:14.739
 the elevation is very good though 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:18.100
 it seems 61 but he is also very tall and 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:19.989
 one meter high and 88 so really not 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.640
 he needs too much elevation but 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.350
 however, I didn't do the header 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.150
 head goals will be because in the city then 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:27.640
 it will be very difficult for us to score goals 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:30.620
 then a small parenthesis for the passage 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:32.810
 the short passage is ok so 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.970
 he finds himself well perhaps with cerci that 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.010
 was fabregas put us fabregas because 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.750
 makes triple agreement with the long passage 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.930
 in fact we are not in fact a counter 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:45.020
 here we see the tops and flops 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:47.330
 absolute final pro physical top 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.040
 then we have 4 star shutter speed 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.080
 weak foot and positioning in attack 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:54.260
 which really was the thing that got me 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:56.120
 pleased so much diego costs i 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.370
 against are the dribbling that sometimes 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.050
 very cumbersome especially if it has to 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.990
 dribble many players 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.639
 the cost here is the cost and I don't feel it 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.380
 to spend 2 million for a player 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:09.770
 which in its defense version is 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:12.380
 very strong you spend just 50k 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:16.130
 they are worth all 50k the version 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:17.510
 coast nick to throw them all inside 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:19.820
 also the version of fa vi 

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:22.160
 I assure you that many goals are wrong 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:24.020
 very few the three stars skille 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.389
 precisely the acceleration the passage 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:29.090
 along the vote that I still give him a 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:31.060
 eight and a half because removing the price 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:34.100
 he is still a good player 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:36.260
 2 million one million 8 I don't have them 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:38.060
 I would spend for this player anyway 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:41.210
 guys this player review ends here 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.860
 hope you enjoyed it i hope you 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:45.740
 have appreciated the commitment we have 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:48.410
 put in since I played seven games 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.490
 and really find a final verdict for 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:51.950
 I live what was really difficult 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:53.660
 because he is a very strange player 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:56.060
 sincerely the times the filmmakers 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:59.710
 so not too much I prefer i 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:01.910
 fantasisti or maybe still even 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:04.580
 players who may be a little more 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:06.380
 fast here is definitely not saying 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.990
 that is n't fast but maybe it's a 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:11.660
 in a hurry, however, I hope that 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:12.710
 you enjoyed this review give me the 

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.289
 your advice 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:17.090
 tell me what you think diego costs and us 

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:19.599
 let's talk to you in a next hello video 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:19.599
 boys
