00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
potatoes so we'll start off by making

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.170 
potatoes so we'll start off by making
slices<00:00:34.469> in<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.620> potatoes<00:00:35.070> so<00:00:35.700> that<00:00:35.850> they<00:00:36.000> heat

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
slices in the potatoes so that they heat

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.510
