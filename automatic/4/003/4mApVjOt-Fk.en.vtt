alright so I've broken up this up into

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.840 
alright so I've broken up this up into
sections<00:00:36.120> just<00:00:37.250> to<00:00:38.250> make<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.579> little<00:00:38.700> bit

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
sections just to make it a little bit

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.670 
sections just to make it a little bit
easier<00:00:39.149> to<00:00:39.239> understand<00:00:39.780> as<00:00:40.200> I<00:00:40.469> do

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
curly brackets is a section and I

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.670 
curly brackets is a section and I
explained<00:02:11.850> this<00:02:12.000> very<00:02:12.150> well<00:02:12.360> but<00:02:12.680> where
