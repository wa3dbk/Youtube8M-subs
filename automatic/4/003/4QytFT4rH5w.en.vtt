00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.839
 friends, hello there you are 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:09.750
 total channel in games and today we 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:14.340
 move away a little from the topic of computer games 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:18.320
 and talk to you about such a wonderful 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:23.550
 the movie which will be released very soon 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:27.080
 somewhere by mid 2015 is called 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.939
 the film the avengers 2 era of altron 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:34.440
 the trailer is already out literally today 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:37.800
 need to give it this morning don't know 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.410
 I looked at him from one side he 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.290
 not impressed but on the other hand in 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.420
 principle something original from the first 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.140
 I liked the parts of the suit 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:52.370
 because there are all heroes food from comics 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:56.879
 marvel and so on it is very interesting 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:59.609
 if you were fond of such in childhood 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:03.239
 super capable 7 superheroes 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:05.299
 then this film is uniquely for you and here 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.930
 already the second part 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:13.200
 showed her trailer a lot of things 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.070
 shown in this trailer I generally personally 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.540
 I do not know who is 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:20.549
 Altron but I think we know it 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.220
 judging by the trailer it's some kind of robot 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:29.720
 huge strong just with red 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:32.400
 eyes and by the way there were rumors that 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:37.110
 in the second part of the avengers will appear 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:40.380
 spiderman I don't know if this is true or 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.479
 no but in the trailer it was not shown in 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.509
 the trailer was shown all the same characters 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:48.990
 who were in the first part and the Tatars 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:52.049
 hulk iron man 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:56.570
 Generally and so on, I'm not even everybody 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:02:02.280
 I remember that is it is very cool cool that 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:05.610
 filmmakers somehow diversify 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.479
 our fantasies say so and adds 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.410
 new heroes 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:13.980
 oh by the way about new heroes about man 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:18.739
 spider I also do not know whether he will or not 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:22.319
 but there will be two new characters 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:27.690
 first this is called his name like 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:32.730
 mercury is generally a dude who can 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:36.330
 very fast run here they are forest 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:40.049
 Of course, well, there will be some 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:43.200
 girl unknown not because i 

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:47.160
 comics did not read but it is definitely from 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:51.390
 her comic ability is also quite 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:55.730
 interesting and what else impressed me so much 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:03:00.540
 this is what appeared at the end of the trailer 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:02.790
 a huge iron man that is 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:07.140
 memorize his suit on red and 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:10.709
 golden inserts so here he has become 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:14.790
 more that is and for some reason hulk with him 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:17.790
 fought I don't know what will be there in terms 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.739
 plot because why hulk get out with 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.400
 iron man not like on one 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:29.040
 side but in the trailer was shown 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:32.600
 it is this story element therefore it 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:37.829
 remains a mystery to us can be 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:39.750
 this altron somehow took under his 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:41.940
 power control but iron man 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:45.870
 because he is made of iron 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:48.150
 three further well well i don't know it 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:51.019
 only in spurts in the trailer 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:57.060
 full information will probably appear to them 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:04:00.180
 closer to the release of the movie film where 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:05.100
 then comes out in the middle of summer next 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:09.389
 years in 2015 a remote movie and there it is very 

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:15.299
 there is a lot of information coming closer 

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:18.780
 By the summer I'm watching the Internet 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:22.380
 all sorts of pictures by the way this character 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:25.590
 under the name of a mercury which without quickly 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:30.830
 run I don't know he will be somewhere in 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:33.080
 Russia or what but there is a picture 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:38.370
 where is he running 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:44.220
 near the vase from the six that is hardly in 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:46.710
 America where there is our Lada on I do not 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:52.050
 I know this picture here is me 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:55.470
 of course a little surprised but anything can 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:58.050
 there can be anything but again on 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:02.449
 another picture is already an american car 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:06.169
 It is worth it, that is, not for a cant 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:08.659
 writers and colt may not but 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:10.520
 You can go online to see and 

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:15.849
 I think you will find these pictures 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:20.689
 and i am also watching now 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:23.150
 pictures here this one here is altron rather 

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:25.490
 everything will be very similar to the next 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:30.740
 iron man on tony starck 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:31.729
 because even there is official art where 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:35.150
 this one 

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:39.710
 Altron is flying in the air and from the hands of his 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:42.080
 also well plasma 18 can shoot from the hands 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:45.259
 plus it is very reminiscent of them iron 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:48.949
 man is therefore very suspicious 

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:55.639
 of course why do we need two iron 

00:05:48.949 --> 00:06:01.879
 man now all just pictures 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:06:04.550
 there are even pictures of people 

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:06.949
 The spider is drawn well, of course, it's 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:11.240
 photoshop I mean people just want it 

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:14.599
 see the movie but its most likely not 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:19.069
 will and people take it that way 

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:22.039
 photoshop embed it on this all 

00:06:19.069 --> 00:06:28.960
 the hero on the likely spider-man is not 

00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:33.229
 it will be a shame of course what can you do well 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:36.740
 what is the principle of the film is very 

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:40.310
 I wait because I repeat that the first 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:42.770
 the second part is not very much liked 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:51.219
 part will surely be a killer too 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:54.999
 just that 's basically i won't be right now 

00:06:51.219 --> 00:06:57.770
 long to discuss this film because 

00:06:54.999 --> 00:07:01.789
 very little information at the moment 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:06.589
 there is only a trailer out of this 

00:07:01.789 --> 00:07:09.560
 Today, well, and I do not even know what you can 

00:07:06.589 --> 00:07:11.900
 add more to my words because 

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:12.940
 can watch the trailer and all by yourself 

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:16.520
 will find out 

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:17.150
 well friends with you was the channel ceilings 

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:20.570
 games 

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:25.340
 it was a movie analyst the avengers to the era 

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:27.410
 Altron such here is a video about 

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:30.139
 film on film analytics will be 

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:31.280
 go out very rarely because I don't 

00:07:30.139 --> 00:07:34.030
 doing movies 

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:37.280
 for more on computer games like 

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:40.760
 I understand doing this so our 

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:46.150
 channel is primarily on computer 

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:48.710
 themes on games and movies are so clean 

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:51.889
 you can just expand your audience 

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:54.440
 say so therefore well, in principle 

00:07:51.889 --> 00:07:57.940
 merry all expressed thank you for 

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.940
 view and all bye
