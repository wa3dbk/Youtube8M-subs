00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
coming in the side I guess it's a good

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.200 
coming in the side I guess it's a good
thought<00:02:34.900> but<00:02:35.430> that<00:02:36.430> happens<00:02:36.670> you<00:02:36.970> know<00:02:37.090> you

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210

hogs<00:02:39.760> to<00:02:40.420> that<00:02:40.570> bomb<00:02:40.780> because<00:02:40.990> you<00:02:41.110> didn't

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
hogs to that bomb because you didn't

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:42.840 
hogs to that bomb because you didn't
want<00:02:41.320> to<00:02:41.470> waste<00:02:41.620> a<00:02:41.740> heel<00:02:41.950> which<00:02:42.130> was<00:02:42.250> the<00:02:42.640> right

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
want to waste a heel which was the right

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.360 
want to waste a heel which was the right
move<00:02:43.200> but<00:02:44.200> had<00:02:44.470> you<00:02:44.500> just<00:02:44.770> sent<00:02:44.950> them<00:02:45.070> in<00:02:45.220> with

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690 
air traps that are in there it's going

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.240 
air traps that are in there it's going
to<00:04:35.720> draw<00:04:35.960> fire<00:04:36.230> from<00:04:36.260> the<00:04:36.500> archer<00:04:36.890> tower<00:04:37.070> from

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130 
the angle that was taken on it then and

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:44.710 
the angle that was taken on it then and
then<00:04:43.310> just<00:04:43.520> that<00:04:43.700> wrapping<00:04:44.210> around<00:04:44.300> the<00:04:44.540> base

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
then just that wrapping around the base

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.650 
then just that wrapping around the base

that's<00:05:04.100> that's<00:05:04.790> a<00:05:04.970> perfect<00:05:05.660> base<00:05:05.780> for<00:05:06.080> it<00:05:06.200> and

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
that's that's a perfect base for it and

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.530 
that's that's a perfect base for it and
a<00:05:06.710> perfect<00:05:07.100> deployment<00:05:07.640> to<00:05:07.970> take<00:05:08.150> this<00:05:08.300> base

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:08.540 
a perfect deployment to take this base
