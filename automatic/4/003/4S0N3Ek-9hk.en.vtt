00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
lot more challenged before I didn't have

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.920 
lot more challenged before I didn't have
to<00:00:23.849> give<00:00:24.000> any<00:00:24.119> thought<00:00:24.240> about<00:00:24.450> life<00:00:24.900> or

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
to give any thought about life or

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.220 
to give any thought about life or
anything<00:00:25.380> like<00:00:25.529> that<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:26.160> then<00:00:26.880> so<00:00:27.300> I<00:00:27.630> had<00:00:28.200> a

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
anything like that and then so I had a

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.409 
anything like that and then so I had a
challenge<00:00:28.739> to<00:00:29.070> look<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.640> God<00:00:29.790> and<00:00:30.000> place<00:00:30.270> my

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:30.419 
challenge to look to God and place my

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:32.690 
challenge to look to God and place my
faith<00:00:30.630> in<00:00:30.840> him<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:30.989> lot<00:00:31.200> more<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:32.369> books<00:00:32.550> I

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
faith in him a lot more the books I

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.870 
faith in him a lot more the books I
would<00:00:32.850> read<00:00:33.030> would<00:00:33.510> be<00:00:34.440> a<00:00:34.710> lot<00:00:34.980> worse<00:00:35.280> I<00:00:35.700> guess

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
would read would be a lot worse I guess

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.040 
would read would be a lot worse I guess
they<00:00:36.329> wouldn't<00:00:36.450> have<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.810> greatest

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
they wouldn't have the greatest

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.020 
they wouldn't have the greatest

and once started reading it and it was

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:28.819 
and once started reading it and it was
kind<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.960> challenge<00:01:28.350> because<00:01:28.469> we<00:01:28.680> had<00:01:28.799> to

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
kind of a challenge because we had to

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.740 
kind of a challenge because we had to
find<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.189> time<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.399> it<00:01:30.270> was<00:01:30.390> more<00:01:30.540> something

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
find the time to it was more something

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.179 
find the time to it was more something
when<00:01:31.380> you're<00:01:31.530> brushing<00:01:31.619> their<00:01:31.890> teeth<00:01:31.920> at

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
when you're brushing their teeth at

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.219 
when you're brushing their teeth at
night<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.490> forget<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.810> they're<00:01:33.899> like<00:01:34.020> oh

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
night you forget to and they're like oh

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.600 
night you forget to and they're like oh
I'm<00:01:34.439> already<00:01:34.649> here<00:01:34.920> I<00:01:35.009> don't<00:01:35.189> want<00:01:35.310> to<00:01:35.369> go<00:01:35.460> back

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
I'm already here I don't want to go back

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.569 
I'm already here I don't want to go back
and<00:01:35.640> do<00:01:35.880> that<00:01:35.939> so<00:01:36.329> I<00:01:37.070> would<00:01:38.070> remember<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.460> go

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
and do that so I would remember to go

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.190 
and do that so I would remember to go
back<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.880> do<00:01:38.969> it<00:01:39.119> was<00:01:39.329> I<00:01:39.360> know<00:01:39.689> just<00:01:39.899> be<00:01:40.020> lazy

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
back to do it was I know just be lazy

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.270 
back to do it was I know just be lazy
and<00:01:41.450> now<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.479> think<00:01:43.020> of<00:01:43.170> one<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.159> the

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
and now I think of one of the

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.010 
and now I think of one of the
installments<00:01:44.850> about<00:01:45.090> Christian<00:01:45.539> laziness

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
installments about Christian laziness

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.700 
installments about Christian laziness
and<00:01:46.460> that's<00:01:47.460> affected<00:01:47.850> my<00:01:47.969> life<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.270> lot

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
and that's affected my life a lot

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.609 
and that's affected my life a lot
and<00:01:48.830> then<00:01:49.670> so<00:01:49.940> if<00:01:50.360> i<00:01:50.450> remember<00:01:50.690> i<00:01:50.869> should<00:01:51.470> read

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
and then so if i remember i should read

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:53.980 
and then so if i remember i should read
my<00:01:51.740> Bible<00:01:52.070> today<00:01:52.250> then<00:01:52.760> I<00:01:53.030> think<00:01:53.869> that

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
my Bible today then I think that

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.149 
my Bible today then I think that
shouldn't<00:01:54.200> be<00:01:54.260> lazy<00:01:54.470> and<00:01:54.590> I'll<00:01:54.770> actually<00:01:54.920> go

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
shouldn't be lazy and I'll actually go

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:58.050 
shouldn't be lazy and I'll actually go

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.700 
one of my obstacles reading the Bible
was<00:02:01.180> understanding<00:02:02.180> some<00:02:02.360> of<00:02:02.390> it<00:02:02.630> I<00:02:02.869> thought<00:02:03.650> I

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
was understanding some of it I thought I

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.109 
was understanding some of it I thought I
would<00:02:03.920> start<00:02:04.100> from<00:02:04.220> the<00:02:04.340> beginning<00:02:04.460> which<00:02:04.880> was

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
would start from the beginning which was

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.260 
would start from the beginning which was
good<00:02:05.659> but<00:02:05.990> it<00:02:06.050> was<00:02:06.170> kind<00:02:06.380> of<00:02:06.409> difficult<00:02:06.909> so<00:02:07.909> I

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
good but it was kind of difficult so I

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.870
