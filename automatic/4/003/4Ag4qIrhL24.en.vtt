00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:34.410
 one because flying wild here we have 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:37.290

 timely and good guys here we would have 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.860

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:22.730
 we would have to 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:26.330

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:28.730
 yes and the ghost here we have 11 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.940
 pixelar I think it 's from one of the two 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.940
 creators 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.849
 sometimes it tells you differently you can 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.819
 enter inside good if you enter by 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:43.810
 I was champion but 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:43.810
 I will give him 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.670
 although I do not think you can do much 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:51.909
 ok we would also have here the 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:55.560
 ghost of pacman we have to sea 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:57.909
 euros and the sign and today I already showed it 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.060
 we would have the genre bein that the truth 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:04.330
 is that I really like how it looks and 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:07.209
 we would have also is that so much good 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:08.950
 here would be the other creator who also 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:11.950
 has to enter inside but the 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:15.519
 truth is that if you go inside if you 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:19.780
 champion here we would have anonymous that the 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:23.040
 it's really cool and let's see 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:25.680
 here around here guys 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.770
 I'm going to show you vale here would be 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.300
 this 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:35.190
 there is more that there is more 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:37.150
 so nobody ever knew and this is 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:42.280
 this the truth is that I have not seen 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:45.540
 it seems if it is a block wow wow estradas 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:48.820
 I had not seen it and it looks great 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:52.570
 Well, as you can see, it 's a spicy 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:54.970
 I think that simulates the diamond they would 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:57.460
 of the diamond post yes because there is no 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:00.760
 another one and then here I would be stinging 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:04.510
 diamond block the truth is that the 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.770
 it really looks cool and so good 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.990
 Boys 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:10.860
 I think this would be all pixel art and 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:13.980
 next week not 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:16.859
 within two days then I will upload another 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.170
 pixelar map but this one is special 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:23.610
 for a server since this map has 

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:26.640
 cities and parkour if things and for a 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:28.050
 server so then nothing after that 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.970
 it's all I hope you liked the 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:35.120
