lot of people i know duel elfin was a
major<00:04:36.850> disappointment<00:04:37.210> because<00:04:38.050> they<00:04:38.530> were

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
major disappointment because they were

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.129 
major disappointment because they were
possibly<00:04:39.880> expecting<00:04:40.509> that<00:04:40.660> it<00:04:40.840> could<00:04:40.960> change

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:41.139 
possibly expecting that it could change

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:44.490 
possibly expecting that it could change
attributes<00:04:41.440> or<00:04:41.949> change<00:04:42.600> g<00:04:43.600> numbers<00:04:44.020> but<00:04:44.320> they

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
attributes or change g numbers but they

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.560 
attributes or change g numbers but they
ended<00:04:45.039> up<00:04:45.130> doing<00:04:45.370> that<00:04:45.490> for<00:04:45.699> elfin<00:04:46.120> and<00:04:46.419> the

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
ended up doing that for elfin and the

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.240 
ended up doing that for elfin and the
weird<00:04:46.750> thing<00:04:46.960> is<00:04:46.990> elfin<00:04:47.500> looks<00:04:47.710> nothing<00:04:47.979> like

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250
