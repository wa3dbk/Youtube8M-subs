of Saints Row 1 one thing you'll notice
right<00:00:25.560> away<00:00:25.710> is<00:00:25.920> that<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.250> Saints<00:00:26.490> are

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580

right away is that the Saints are
wearing<00:00:26.939> green<00:00:27.269> this<00:00:27.720> is<00:00:27.900> what<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.140> original

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
wearing green this is what the original

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.080 
wearing green this is what the original
game<00:00:28.740> colors<00:00:29.039> were<00:00:29.220> for<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.550> Saints<00:00:29.849> but<00:00:29.970> it

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
game colors were for the Saints but it

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.460 
game colors were for the Saints but it
was<00:00:30.179> changed<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.630> purple<00:00:30.779> about<00:00:31.050> a<00:00:31.199> year

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
was changed to purple about a year

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.709

before<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.859> game's<00:00:32.040> release<00:00:32.180> so<00:00:33.180> this<00:00:33.570> is

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
before the game's release so this is

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.569 
before the game's release so this is
probably<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.350> first<00:00:34.620> seen<00:00:34.920> stroke<00:00:35.190> game<00:00:35.399> ever

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
made since it still uses the early

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.290 
made since it still uses the early
concepts<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:38.520> goal<00:00:38.700> of<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:38.940> game<00:00:39.059> is

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
concepts the goal of the game is

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.299 
concepts the goal of the game is
somewhat<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.570> same<00:00:39.690> as<00:00:39.960> the<00:00:40.079> Xbox<00:00:40.440> version<00:00:40.860> do

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309

are weak the map is bland the controls

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.780 
are weak the map is bland the controls
are<00:02:08.940> awful<00:02:09.179> but<00:02:10.140> at<00:02:10.560> least<00:02:10.800> we<00:02:11.069> can<00:02:11.220> customize

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
are awful but at least we can customize

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.410

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.230 
actually in this game which is
impressive<00:02:15.690> I<00:02:16.200> guess<00:02:16.590> I<00:02:16.890> don't<00:02:17.370> know<00:02:17.640> but<00:02:18.000> I

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
impressive I guess I don't know but I

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.150 
impressive I guess I don't know but I
think<00:02:18.660> this<00:02:18.750> game<00:02:19.020> was<00:02:19.260> completed<00:02:19.800> before<00:02:19.950> the

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
think this game was completed before the

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.100 
think this game was completed before the
official<00:02:20.430> Saints<00:02:20.910> Row<00:02:21.060> script<00:02:21.480> was<00:02:21.660> completed

official Saints Row script was completed

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.050

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
because besides the main Saints cast all

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.630 
because besides the main Saints cast all
the<00:02:24.540> gang<00:02:24.750> leaders<00:02:25.080> are<00:02:25.260> referred<00:02:25.620> to<00:02:25.650> as<00:02:26.070> the

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
the gang leaders are referred to as the

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.240 
the gang leaders are referred to as the
boss<00:02:26.900> so<00:02:27.900> this<00:02:28.290> is<00:02:28.440> kind<00:02:28.770> of<00:02:28.830> an<00:02:28.950> interesting
