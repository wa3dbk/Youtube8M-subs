gate<00:05:24.710> the<00:05:24.860> second<00:05:25.220> gate<00:05:25.430> I<00:05:25.700> thought<00:05:26.360> that<00:05:26.600> it

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:26.780 
gate the second gate I thought that it

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.990 
gate the second gate I thought that it
is<00:05:26.900> possible<00:05:27.410> to<00:05:27.470> jump<00:05:27.860> it<00:05:28.070> with<00:05:28.280> a<00:05:28.310> normal<00:05:28.730> car
