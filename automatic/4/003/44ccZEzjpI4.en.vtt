 don't throw the video because it is 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.660
 important that you know this 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.760
 it comes down to the pin part one

 which is online top left is the new one 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.660
 king way for that is bram bram 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.250
 maybe you know him but yes 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.719
 we may not be king anymore i am 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.129
 had the choice between moderator one 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.500
 Queen and I finally got it 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.579
 just opted for moderates because me 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.710
 more people can help 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.030
 for that I am also mainly concerned with ddg 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.870
 helping people 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.390
 of course also for my pleasure 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.860
 of course but people help that 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.450
 I also like to do what I want today 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.090
 show in this video 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.250
 is the ivar by base we prefer 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.500
 a built by base to all such as it 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.070
 keeping true to come to massively 4 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.080
 especially 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.939
 yes just before the land is allowed 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.619
 skip hopping people in again 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.990
 are the brakes a solution 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.280
 have figured out a toll base for about 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.860
 and then we are now before the 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.509
 entrance are two towers can of one 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.979
 quadrilateral again it for then a little bit 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.079
 show save this position again 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.360
 unbelievably also possible in principle 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.850
 just see everything now but this is it 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.140
 al base is really huge it boys 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.759
 is far 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.180
 really compliments to the bower they are from 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:45.540
 pigeon and laurens and all those people like chin 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.920
 um sorry but yes that is again 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.360
 not all construction sets my head too much 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.430
 People who don't care about him do n't 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.530
 have designed have been built on 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.149
 also a thank you to those people really 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.710
 super in a deadline anyway 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.540
 Friday night 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.450
 unfortunately just not met what him 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.310
 Saturday morning, I think 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.619
 really complete or with flags but we 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.899
 have really pushed hard Friday 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.310
 the real 20 of those in the layers with 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:09.349
 smet is all possible 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.729
 all finished so that was super cool 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:11.780
 we enter the toll beast because 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.120
 that's what this video is for 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.440
 largely yes one to say that i 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.819
 so no more a king was two 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.590
 this toll base because if again a whole 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.080
 important point in the fuck you really have 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.860
 pushed hard for a week just on this 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.690
 this continues 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.860
 but this is the store base guys we 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.150
 just go inside 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.709
 every two doors still have to be removed 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.450
 because I think it will be open 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:30.920
 its no idea then you have it here if you 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.840
 Immediately one links goes one I think 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.220
 dead end piece is not sure 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.260
 actually 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.849
 there now not looked yes look so that is 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.019
 make walking a little useless again 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:41.360
 is not intended 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:43.220
 watch the king bram or watch as 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.019
 you walk straight ahead then you drive to 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.950
 upstairs and he looks for you again then you stand 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.810
 here as it were 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.489
 we also have a very beautiful canal 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.900
 to happen with the whole base toll done 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:52.370
 purely for the beautiful thou and I know 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.769
 no one who could hang you but you hear 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.440
 ie not but so you come on top of the 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:59.690
 toll baby stand.so two houses on there 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.280
 is a house and here is a house 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.720
 the different towers that you can enter 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.910
 to watch 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.290
 yes just to get a better overview 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.730
 having the sea because it is natural 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:09.260
 so that who you dc 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.060
 must find those on the ivory coast 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.350
 furthermore you have stalls where 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.880
 So you could possibly trade something in it 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.980
 that direction and over and that chester 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.930
 spread on the base that you look and 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.359
 or stuff that really wants to disturb time quickly 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.900
 he is purely for fighting, you can go there quickly 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:22.910
 put in 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.500
 yes this house i want this sms't my house 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.120
 you can claim that this could be officially claimed 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.829
 but someone has bullied a lot 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.470
 sign of me set up this month 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:31.970
 my house is that furnished piece and not 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.950
 interesting for indoors or just look 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.079
 she's nothing at all even the stairs she's 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.850
 way sapphire so so but that makes 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:39.260
 not just so we can see 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:41.060
 another house quickly on the other side 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.170
 I don't know what that is for 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.630
 how to just add the feature 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.900
 those houses come up with something but yes 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.610
 so not done 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.049
 with this pet him here knows that 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:51.030
 I happen to be 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:52.890
 this is the home of comfort in a that 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.450
 nothing wrong with Mangerie 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.439
 he is not yours at all has a look 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.700
 me down 

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:58.260
 it is quite complicated for that 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.310
 because you can get in pretty fast 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.689
 to get lost 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.129
 if i am very honest i get lost 

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:04.049
 she sometimes introduced me 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:05.579
 let's see we go here and then you can 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:07.799
 you here if it is a door somewhere 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:09.870
 I walk inside overflow error that mean 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:10.590
 I we go the other way when we go 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.620
 here to the left 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.609
 and look down there through the tower 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.459
 together 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:19.769
 fucky smart and i on where and then you come 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.750
 you couldn't do a layer below that 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.910
 walk to here so you have a low de 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.680
 below you can also shoot at the sea 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.300
 imagine more tender so you come with a group 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.800
 from 40 to 50 men I know I feel proud 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.780
 we can just be here 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.130
 stand in nice shooting you know 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.229
 because in that language therefore not berries 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:36.210
 come quickly take a look yes you can here 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:38.400
 another layer down then you can here 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.830
 here you can go down one more layer and 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.240
 here is actually the main hall as i am 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.340
 not wrong oil have another layer 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.090
 I mean goddamn it shot things 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.280
 and then i thought 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.770
 well another layer where you can shoot 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.330
 as you can see, water is fine 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.740
 again we just didn't have water 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.940
 lying everywhere 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.389
 furthermore you have a kind of yes what 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.760
 is it ok xp here so yes i am now 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:01.050
 but it's kind of like that 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:03.599
 decoration and here you have the big one 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.590
 main hall shot point at the meeting point 

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:06.419
 on 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.889
 here are also another shoot goes in 

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:10.289
 these are from that whole chilling because 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:11.490
 here these look really exactly above the 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:13.110
 sea ​​out of it yet 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.880
 we only hit our heads above 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.470
 it's super chill shooting like that 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.400
 for men it is also difficult to 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.870
 to touch us 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.789
 but this is the very big toll booth 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.260
 boys he is not finished as it were 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:24.539
 yes that is hard to explain you have 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.710
 this is what it is like you 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:30.570
 clearly also 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:32.159
 you as long as they have next door 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:33.810
 you will be a rules and regulations 

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:36.150
 it completely changed the 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:37.530
 toll gate design and there we are 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.030
 not come to it because it does best 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:41.099
 quite a long time with must also be designed 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.710
 and also the spawn is not quite 

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:44.170
 we have to do that 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:47.000
 which has now slightly more priority 

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:48.140
 like this you happen but here like you 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.760
 so seeing is also completely 

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.990
 extended and that goes on for a long time 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.090
 so in the rules 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.590
 oh shit okay then we go to this island 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:56.360
 you when i forgot we had this 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:57.740
 island you still that is last 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.930
 was near built but this islet 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.520
 designed by flurry as a mini guide and 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.870
 twenty was super cool looking it adds 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.180
 something to it for you know 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.220
 well ff rob rob rob then we are upstairs 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.900
 he was also another entrance apparently 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.610
 well this is an extra port true 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:11.990
 you can get up you want something 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.490
 finer range because in it 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.410
 of course you don't have that 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.420
 long range as here because child has 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.340
 lunar player distance 

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:20.780
 happen four times more 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:22.580
 but those who look for a virus 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:24.560
 fort you want it looks super cool 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:25.790
 we even if it does not completely leave behind or 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.230
 you so I my videos settings i de 

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:31.250
 high move so rob 

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:33.350
 loading come on he will slowly load 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:35.300
 but this just looks super 

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:36.620
 great guys and for something like that 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.450
 so we want all around rules 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:41.060
 buildings that have a little more protection in rails 

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:42.890
 this if the project is something again 

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:44.360
 look nicer because if you are already honest 

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:46.100
 it looked a little pvv 

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.710
 focus and well this is also one 

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:53.470
 bit of PV grid with which holes are made 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:56.420
 I know but what the fuck oh lol 

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:58.010
 but it's just so hard to do though 

00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:00.350
 to stop its from standing on such 

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:02.270
 kind in emmen the same kind of something point 

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:04.250
 it is also difficult for you to come in 

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:05.720
 it is just far away but this was 

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:06.950
