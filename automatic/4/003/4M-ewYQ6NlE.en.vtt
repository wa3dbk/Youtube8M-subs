transformation<00:00:25.470> just<00:00:25.980> like<00:00:26.160> Laserbeak<00:00:27.260> about

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
transformation just like Laserbeak about

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.049 
transformation just like Laserbeak about
to<00:00:28.349> transform<00:00:28.890> them<00:00:29.660> those<00:00:30.660> get<00:00:30.929> flipped<00:00:31.289> down

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
to transform them those get flipped down

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:35.750 
to transform them those get flipped down
let's<00:00:33.059> flip<00:00:33.300> down<00:00:33.860> and<00:00:34.860> here<00:00:35.160> I<00:00:35.190> kind<00:00:35.489> of<00:00:35.550> got<00:00:35.730> I

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
let's flip down and here I kind of got I

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.410 
let's flip down and here I kind of got I
get<00:00:35.969> your<00:00:36.090> nail<00:00:36.270> under<00:00:36.630> his<00:00:36.780> ears<00:00:37.170> there<00:00:38.420> and

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
get your nail under his ears there and

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.880 
get your nail under his ears there and
that's<00:00:39.600> on<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:40.200> double<00:00:40.710> hinge<00:00:42.620> so<00:00:43.620> you<00:00:43.710> kind<00:00:43.860> of

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
that's on a double hinge so you kind of

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.639 
that's on a double hinge so you kind of
just<00:00:44.040> got<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.309> maneuver<00:00:44.700> so<00:00:44.940> it's<00:00:45.059> flat<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:46.350> see

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
just got a maneuver so it's flat you see

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.200 
just got a maneuver so it's flat you see
there's<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.010> feet<00:00:47.190> there<00:00:47.870> these<00:00:48.870> up<00:00:49.289> here

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
there's the feet there these up here

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:57.340 
there's the feet there these up here
fold<00:00:51.210> out<00:00:51.420> like<00:00:51.719> that<00:00:54.020> rotate<00:00:55.020> around<00:00:56.030> and

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
fold out like that rotate around and

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.630 
fold out like that rotate around and
then<00:00:58.350> these<00:00:58.559> are<00:00:58.859> here<00:00:59.100> gonna<00:00:59.309> go<00:00:59.520> down<00:01:01.640> bring

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
then these are here gonna go down bring

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.780 
then these are here gonna go down bring
them<00:01:02.820> around<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.300> back<00:01:03.329> here<00:01:04.339> pull<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.460> arms

them around the back here pull the arms
down<00:01:08.030> this<00:01:09.030> right<00:01:09.299> here<00:01:09.540> will<00:01:09.780> flip<00:01:10.320> on<00:01:10.470> that

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
down this right here will flip on that

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.840 
down this right here will flip on that
double<00:01:10.890> hinge<00:01:11.630> all<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.840> way<00:01:12.930> up<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.200> back

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
double hinge all the way up to the back

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.690 
double hinge all the way up to the back
and<00:01:14.850> these<00:01:15.240> right<00:01:15.479> here<00:01:16.220> this<00:01:17.220> middle<00:01:17.580> piece

I'll transfer them back here flip these

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:57.420 
I'll transfer them back here flip these
triangle<00:01:54.160> pieces<00:01:54.490> in<00:01:55.770> gonna<00:01:56.770> take<00:01:56.979> this<00:01:57.160> back

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
triangle pieces in gonna take this back

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.460 
triangle pieces in gonna take this back
here<00:01:59.490> whip<00:02:00.490> this<00:02:00.729> back<00:02:01.090> up<00:02:01.390> which<00:02:01.750> is<00:02:01.960> kind<00:02:02.320> of

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
here whip this back up which is kind of

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:03.900 
here whip this back up which is kind of
hard<00:02:02.680> to<00:02:02.770> do<00:02:03.009> because<00:02:03.280> it<00:02:03.399> gets<00:02:03.550> in<00:02:03.700> the<00:02:03.759> way<00:02:03.789> of

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:03.910 
hard to do because it gets in the way of

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:09.529 
hard to do because it gets in the way of
that<00:02:04.210> right<00:02:04.479> there<00:02:06.660> that<00:02:07.660> just<00:02:07.780> flips<00:02:08.110> back<00:02:08.320> up

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
that right there that just flips back up

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.150 
that right there that just flips back up
flip<00:02:10.539> this<00:02:10.810> middle<00:02:11.230> part<00:02:11.380> on<00:02:11.680> this<00:02:11.860> double

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
flip this middle part on this double

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.030 
flip this middle part on this double
hinge<00:02:12.400> you<00:02:12.850> see<00:02:13.060> it<00:02:13.150> rotates<00:02:13.630> here<00:02:14.019> and<00:02:14.950> it

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
hinge you see it rotates here and it

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.640 
hinge you see it rotates here and it
rotates<00:02:15.220> down<00:02:15.730> here<00:02:16.060> you<00:02:17.019> want<00:02:17.200> it<00:02:17.290> to<00:02:17.470> have

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
rotates down here you want it to have

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.440 
rotates down here you want it to have
the<00:02:18.070> feet<00:02:18.280> sticking<00:02:18.850> straight<00:02:19.269> up<00:02:19.450> like<00:02:19.660> that

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
the feet sticking straight up like that

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.050 
the feet sticking straight up like that
take<00:02:22.450> around<00:02:22.630> the<00:02:22.750> back<00:02:22.930> like<00:02:23.170> that<00:02:24.060> just

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
take around the back like that just

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:31.800 
take around the back like that just
close<00:02:25.360> up<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:27.250> wings<00:02:27.459> here<00:02:29.640> you<00:02:30.640> can<00:02:30.820> rotate

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
close up the wings here you can rotate

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.430 
close up the wings here you can rotate
these<00:02:32.260> around<00:02:32.400> so<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:34.720> fins<00:02:34.930> are<00:02:35.110> pointing

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
these around so the fins are pointing

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.140 
these around so the fins are pointing
down<00:02:36.209> hold<00:02:37.209> the<00:02:37.390> Jets<00:02:37.600> up<00:02:38.700> and<00:02:39.700> then<00:02:39.910> close

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
down hold the Jets up and then close

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.990 
down hold the Jets up and then close
that<00:02:40.980> and<00:02:41.980> then<00:02:42.220> it's<00:02:42.400> just<00:02:42.519> a<00:02:42.670> matter<00:02:42.700> of

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
that and then it's just a matter of

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:52.180 
that and then it's just a matter of
flipping<00:02:43.360> the<00:02:44.310> head<00:02:45.310> part<00:02:45.579> up<00:02:47.190> and<00:02:48.390> the<00:02:49.390> wings
