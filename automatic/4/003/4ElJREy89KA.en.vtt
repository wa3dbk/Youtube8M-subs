the perfect house and something was

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.279 
the perfect house and something was
missing<00:01:44.609> so<00:01:44.969> I<00:01:45.000> started<00:01:45.390> kind<00:01:45.840> of<00:01:45.899> checking<00:01:46.200> in

00:01:46.279 --> 00:01:46.289 
missing so I started kind of checking in

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:48.709 
missing so I started kind of checking in
with<00:01:46.380> myself<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.009> I<00:01:47.130> figured<00:01:47.490> out<00:01:47.579> that<00:01:47.719> it's

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:48.719 
with myself and I figured out that it's

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:51.499 
with myself and I figured out that it's
not<00:01:48.869> really<00:01:49.500> for<00:01:49.770> me<00:01:49.829> it's<00:01:50.219> not<00:01:50.340> about<00:01:50.509> anymore

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
not really for me it's not about anymore

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.419 
not really for me it's not about anymore
where<00:01:51.929> I<00:01:51.959> am<00:01:52.229> in<00:01:52.349> the<00:01:52.439> world<00:01:52.560> it's<00:01:52.950> who<00:01:53.310> I'm

00:01:53.419 --> 00:01:53.429 
where I am in the world it's who I'm

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:55.729 
where I am in the world it's who I'm
with<00:01:53.609> and<00:01:53.880> because<00:01:54.630> I<00:01:54.659> was<00:01:54.869> there<00:01:55.049> alone<00:01:55.259> by

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:55.739 
with and because I was there alone by

00:01:55.739 --> 00:01:57.859 
with and because I was there alone by
myself<00:01:56.159> I<00:01:56.310> had<00:01:56.459> friends<00:01:56.849> but<00:01:57.090> it's<00:01:57.299> not<00:01:57.659> the

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
myself I had friends but it's not the

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.749 
myself I had friends but it's not the
same<00:01:58.079> you<00:01:58.649> know<00:01:58.739> when<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:59.159> family<00:01:59.549> is<00:01:59.610> not

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
there so I kind of started to do a

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:04.819 
there so I kind of started to do a
little<00:02:03.869> bit<00:02:04.020> of<00:02:04.110> soul<00:02:04.319> searching<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:04.770> I

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
little bit of soul searching and I

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.429 
little bit of soul searching and I
realized<00:02:05.189> that<00:02:05.280> I<00:02:05.610> realized<00:02:06.119> that<00:02:06.299> I<00:02:06.689> was<00:02:07.049> okay
