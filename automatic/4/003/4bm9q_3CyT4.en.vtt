00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.670
Next to skate will be the 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.050
defending European Champion

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.139
3 time European Champion

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:11.149
Maria Butyrskaya

00:00:11.149 --> 00:00:12.669
The 99 World Champion

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:16.899
the first Russian to win the World title .The oldest woman at the age of 26 

00:00:16.899 --> 00:00:19.119
to win a World Championship

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:21.279
Ranked #3 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.569
by the International Skating Union

00:00:25.569 --> 00:00:29.109
And she won the technical program 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:34.440
At the Euro. Championship It's not usually her strength; 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.220
often a mine field for Maria

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.090
she's slowly, very slowly taking her time 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:48.090
to move into her start position  Music will be from Song of White Nights

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:17.100
Connecting steps straight into the triple flip.  Well done!

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:32.270
Her combination is next... triple lutz/double toe

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:01.570
Well done flying camel, certainly no shortage of revolutions in that spin

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:11.779
She's looked very good 

00:02:11.779 --> 00:02:18.779
to this point
Her three jump elements have gone well for her
0.2:53: This is where Maria comes up short
Up against the likes of Michelle Kwan and Sasha Cohen
and Sarah Hughes
This spiral sequence
She just doesn't have the extension or flexibility of the top skaters

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:30.719
Layback spin to conclude her short program, And I'm sure we'll see a big smile on her face
She is a battler, Maria Butyrskaya
Fourth in Nagano

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.849
she certainly didn't show any fear out
here this evening

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:44.639
Here's her opening combination

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:49.109
Nice, nice, really true outside edge on that take off

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:51.339
She fought for the landing and had to wait to get back into position

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:53.909
Gets the double toe done; 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:55.779
not the greatest of flow 

00:03:55.779 --> 00:03:58.729
But it's a complete element with no deduction

00:03:58.729 --> 00:04:01.570
She's not a natural jumper like some of the others out there

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:03.430
She really has to work 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.629
for everything out there; and gets them done

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:10.909
Sometimes through sheer determination

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:13.739
But she has to be very relieved because she 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.489
Can't put down a program 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:16.839
much better than she just did

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:21.380
Five time Russian champion
Who was told by a Russian coach 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.729
when she was 15 that 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:26.069
She should probably think of quitting soon

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:30.310
One World Championship and two other World bronze medals later

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.689
And now looking for an Olympic medal

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:37.189
Butyrskaya putting down 

00:04:37.189 --> 00:04:41.990
one of her best technical programs

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.520
She has a look of

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:44.669
concern

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:48.929
knowing 
I wonder what this panel is going to put up for marks

00:04:48.929 --> 00:04:55.929
Quite the range, Wow! 5.2 from Germany, 5.7 from Russia and Belarus 
Excuse me 5.0 from

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:03.699
the Italian judge!

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:10.699
So we are getting an interesting spread of ordinals
So it's not unanimous, although Cohen is the leader. Good set of second marks

00:05:13.989 --> 00:05:15.550
and Butyrskaya is third 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.160
behind the two Americans

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:18.590
With three first place ordinals
