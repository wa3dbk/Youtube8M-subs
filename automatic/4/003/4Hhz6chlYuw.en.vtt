00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
hey guys how's it going so today I

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:04.760 
hey guys how's it going so today I
wanted<00:00:02.730> to<00:00:02.790> show<00:00:03.060> you<00:00:03.120> guys<00:00:03.470> underground<00:00:04.470> tea

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
wanted to show you guys underground tea

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.130 
wanted to show you guys underground tea
and<00:00:04.890> tea<00:00:05.069> can<00:00:05.310> in<00:00:05.430> my<00:00:05.549> boat<00:00:05.759> so<00:00:06.720> the<00:00:06.810> idea<00:00:07.049> is

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
and tea can in my boat so the idea is

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.320 
and tea can in my boat so the idea is
pretty<00:00:07.170> straightforward<00:00:07.620> is<00:00:08.040> that<00:00:08.220> if<00:00:08.910> a<00:00:08.970> TNT

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
pretty straightforward is that if a TNT

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.410 
pretty straightforward is that if a TNT
cannon<00:00:09.690> and<00:00:10.080> none<00:00:10.889> of<00:00:10.920> its<00:00:11.190> exposed<00:00:11.940> above

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
cannon and none of its exposed above

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.039 
cannon and none of its exposed above
ground<00:00:12.660> but<00:00:12.929> it<00:00:13.019> shoots<00:00:14.480> it<00:00:15.480> doesn't<00:00:15.839> like

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
ground but it shoots it doesn't like

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.150 
ground but it shoots it doesn't like
shoot<00:00:16.289> upwards<00:00:16.619> anything<00:00:16.920> that<00:00:17.010> shoots

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
shoot upwards anything that shoots

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.980 
shoot upwards anything that shoots
forward<00:00:17.490> so<00:00:18.830> yeah<00:00:19.830> I<00:00:19.859> made<00:00:20.039> one<00:00:20.220> I<00:00:20.840> think<00:00:21.840> I've

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
forward so yeah I made one I think I've

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.220 
forward so yeah I made one I think I've
ever<00:00:22.170> actually<00:00:22.970> made<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:24.060> team<00:00:24.330> tea<00:00:24.570> cannon<00:00:25.019> on

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
ever actually made a team tea cannon on

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.560 
ever actually made a team tea cannon on
this<00:00:25.680> channel<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.490> like<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.970> three<00:00:27.390> years

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
this channel and like the three years

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.210 
this channel and like the three years
I've<00:00:27.720> had<00:00:27.900> it<00:00:28.080> maybe<00:00:28.260> some<00:00:28.470> really<00:00:28.680> bad<00:00:28.859> ones

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
I've had it maybe some really bad ones

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.220 
I've had it maybe some really bad ones
but<00:00:30.830> someone<00:00:31.830> was<00:00:32.070> like<00:00:32.250> oh<00:00:32.600> this<00:00:33.600> is<00:00:34.020> there

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
but someone was like oh this is there

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.780 
but someone was like oh this is there
such<00:00:34.410> thing<00:00:34.440> as<00:00:34.680> an<00:00:34.890> underground<00:00:35.280> Tootsie

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
such thing as an underground Tootsie

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.110 
such thing as an underground Tootsie
Canyon<00:00:36.120> or<00:00:36.239> like<00:00:36.390> a<00:00:37.100> you<00:00:38.100> know<00:00:38.160> on<00:00:38.460> that's<00:00:38.940> what

five blocks forward from the actual

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.940 
five blocks forward from the actual
cannon<00:01:08.130> site<00:01:08.720> and<00:01:09.720> at<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.170> peak<00:01:10.409> of<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.740> arc

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
cannon site and at the peak of the arc

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.910 
cannon site and at the peak of the arc
it<00:01:11.310> is<00:01:11.780> three<00:01:12.860> six<00:01:15.140> it's<00:01:16.140> you<00:01:16.470> it<00:01:16.680> can<00:01:16.799> usually

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
it is three six it's you it can usually

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.840 
it is three six it's you it can usually
clear<00:01:17.460> twelve<00:01:17.970> blocks<00:01:18.950> so<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.070> arc<00:01:20.220> usually

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
clear twelve blocks so the arc usually

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.310 
clear twelve blocks so the arc usually
reaches<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.240> max<00:01:21.509> height<00:01:21.720> of<00:01:21.810> about<00:01:21.990> twelve

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
reaches a max height of about twelve

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.149 
reaches a max height of about twelve
blocks<00:01:22.560> there<00:01:24.049> yeah<00:01:25.049> like<00:01:25.380> that<00:01:25.560> okay<00:01:25.770> about

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.270 
take off this stuff what's going on is
there's<00:01:37.950> just<00:01:38.250> um<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:38.990> can<00:01:39.990> see<00:01:40.200> two<00:01:40.560> sort<00:01:41.100> of

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
there's just um you can see two sort of

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.170 
there's just um you can see two sort of
TNT<00:01:42.210> dispensing<00:01:42.780> areas<00:01:43.049> so<00:01:43.649> there's<00:01:43.860> the

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
TNT dispensing areas so there's the

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.630 
TNT dispensing areas so there's the
propelling<00:01:45.180> TNT<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.899> actual<00:01:46.640> ammunition

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
propelling TNT and the actual ammunition

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.149 
propelling TNT and the actual ammunition
TNT<00:01:48.119> that's<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.229> first<00:01:49.409> one<00:01:49.560> here<00:01:49.770> just<00:01:49.799> is

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
TNT that's the first one here just is

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.160 
TNT that's the first one here just is
one<00:01:50.430> sort<00:01:50.820> of<00:01:50.850> ammunition<00:01:51.149> TNT<00:01:51.780> at<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:51.960> time

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
one sort of ammunition TNT at a time

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.230 
one sort of ammunition TNT at a time
suppose<00:01:53.100> you<00:01:53.220> could<00:01:53.340> actually<00:01:53.460> put<00:01:53.759> dispenser

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
suppose you could actually put dispenser

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.700 
suppose you could actually put dispenser
where<00:01:54.570> each<00:01:54.659> of<00:01:54.810> these<00:01:54.930> melons<00:01:55.229> are<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.560> have

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
where each of these melons are and have

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.499 
where each of these melons are and have
it<00:01:55.860> delivered<00:01:56.280> four<00:01:56.820> times<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.180> payload

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
it delivered four times the payload

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.260 
it delivered four times the payload
there

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
there

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.830 
there
I<00:01:59.350> figured<00:02:00.350> this<00:02:00.470> works<00:02:00.619> just<00:02:00.799> fine<00:02:01.630> and<00:02:02.630> then

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
I figured this works just fine and then

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.069 
I figured this works just fine and then
it'll<00:02:03.320> fire<00:02:03.799> the<00:02:04.340> pistons<00:02:04.759> this<00:02:05.420> one<00:02:05.630> fires<00:02:05.869> a

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079 
it'll fire the pistons this one fires a

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:09.370 
it'll fire the pistons this one fires a
tick<00:02:06.320> later<00:02:06.920> than<00:02:07.189> that<00:02:07.340> one<00:02:07.580> so<00:02:08.200> that<00:02:09.200> way

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
pretty straightforward and it's about

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:27.339 
pretty straightforward and it's about
all<00:02:25.640> I<00:02:25.700> had<00:02:25.819> to<00:02:25.910> show<00:02:26.000> you<00:02:26.090> guys<00:02:26.269> I<00:02:26.300> suppose<00:02:27.200> the

all I had to show you guys I suppose the

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:29.290 
all I had to show you guys I suppose the
next<00:02:27.650> step<00:02:27.920> forward<00:02:28.459> with<00:02:28.640> this<00:02:28.819> thing<00:02:29.090> would

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
next step forward with this thing would

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.670 
next step forward with this thing would
be<00:02:29.420> to<00:02:29.569> actually<00:02:29.720> try<00:02:30.140> to<00:02:32.200> like<00:02:33.200> make<00:02:33.380> it<00:02:33.410> so

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
be to actually try to like make it so

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.220 
be to actually try to like make it so
Pistons<00:02:34.489> would<00:02:34.730> place<00:02:35.090> sands<00:02:35.569> like<00:02:35.870> whatever

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230

block<00:02:36.530> is<00:02:36.709> right<00:02:36.890> here<00:02:37.190> there<00:02:37.519> and<00:02:37.790> then

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
block is right here there and then

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.640 
block is right here there and then
remove<00:02:38.239> it<00:02:38.360> via<00:02:38.600> the<00:02:38.780> TNT<00:02:39.110> and<00:02:39.170> put<00:02:39.380> the<00:02:39.470> block

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
remove it via the TNT and put the block

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.789 
remove it via the TNT and put the block
back<00:02:39.890> so<00:02:40.130> it's<00:02:40.250> completely<00:02:40.730> hidden<00:02:41.560> but<00:02:42.560> from

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
back so it's completely hidden but from

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:47.289 
back so it's completely hidden but from
what<00:02:43.100> I<00:02:43.130> found<00:02:43.760> is<00:02:44.180> a<00:02:45.370> if<00:02:46.370> you<00:02:46.670> raise<00:02:47.269> the

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
what I found is a if you raise the

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:50.380 
what I found is a if you raise the
ground<00:02:48.140> level<00:02:48.350> up<00:02:48.590> any<00:02:48.920> higher<00:02:49.130> here<00:02:49.670> this

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
ground level up any higher here this

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.900 
ground level up any higher here this

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
sandstone will start to get blown up by

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.110
