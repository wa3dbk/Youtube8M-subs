00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:17.079 
to get used to essentially move on a

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:18.569 
to get used to essentially move on a

but<00:03:20.829> the<00:03:20.920> entire<00:03:21.310> game<00:03:21.639> is<00:03:21.790> built<00:03:22.060> around<00:03:22.209> this

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
but the entire game is built around this

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.780 
but the entire game is built around this
idea<00:03:22.569> so<00:03:23.139> every<00:03:23.439> room<00:03:23.680> puzzle<00:03:24.310> an<00:03:24.400> enemy<00:03:24.700> is

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790
