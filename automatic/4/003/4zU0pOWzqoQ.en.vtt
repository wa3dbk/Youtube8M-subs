00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
that's one of the most vital things is

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:21.220 
that's one of the most vital things is
to<00:01:03.110> not<00:01:03.290> take<00:01:03.500> risks

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:21.230 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.940 

grenades<00:01:22.010> don't<00:01:22.280> get<00:01:22.460> you<00:01:22.580> in<00:01:22.670> there<00:01:22.850> as<00:01:23.030> well

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
grenades don't get you in there as well

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.200 
grenades don't get you in there as well
generally<00:01:24.950> they<00:01:25.070> don't<00:01:25.100> if<00:01:25.490> you<00:01:25.640> if<00:01:25.910> you<00:01:26.000> hide

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
down here you're protected by the desk

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:50.600 
down here you're protected by the desk
or<00:01:30.890> the<00:01:31.130> kitchen<00:01:31.520> unit

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.870 

see<00:01:51.240> as<00:01:51.360> soon<00:01:51.570> as<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:51.900> walk<00:01:52.080> out<00:01:52.350> there<00:01:52.620> you're

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
see as soon as you walk out there you're

00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:05.380 
see as soon as you walk out there you're
exposing<00:01:53.880> yourself<00:01:54.030> and<00:01:54.450> it<00:01:54.600> is<00:01:54.720> risky

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.169 

p

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.899 

so<00:02:09.810> now<00:02:09.959> it's<00:02:10.109> just<00:02:10.259> this<00:02:10.469> chopper<00:02:11.009> that's

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:11.909 
so now it's just this chopper that's

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:13.069 
so now it's just this chopper that's
another<00:02:12.180> thing<00:02:12.359> you've<00:02:12.540> got<00:02:12.659> to<00:02:12.750> stay<00:02:12.900> inside

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:13.079 
another thing you've got to stay inside

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:15.410 
another thing you've got to stay inside
and<00:02:13.430> although<00:02:14.430> i<00:02:14.459> deployed<00:02:14.909> the<00:02:15.030> right-field

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
and although i deployed the right-field

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.880 
and although i deployed the right-field
squad<00:02:15.719> they<00:02:15.840> just<00:02:16.019> all<00:02:16.290> get<00:02:16.409> killed<00:02:16.469> because

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
squad they just all get killed because

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.199 
squad they just all get killed because
of<00:02:17.099> the<00:02:17.340> chopper<00:02:18.890> but<00:02:19.890> I<00:02:19.920> I<00:02:20.400> can't<00:02:20.849> really<00:02:21.030> take

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
of the chopper but I I can't really take

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.649 
of the chopper but I I can't really take
the<00:02:21.329> risk<00:02:21.510> of<00:02:22.790> taking<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:24.030> top<00:02:24.209> rack<00:02:24.390> first

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:24.659 
the risk of taking the top rack first

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:28.520 
the risk of taking the top rack first
because<00:02:26.150> I've<00:02:27.150> tried<00:02:27.359> that<00:02:27.629> before<00:02:27.780> and<00:02:28.049> I<00:02:28.260> had

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
because I've tried that before and I had

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:42.070 
because I've tried that before and I had
to<00:02:28.769> go<00:02:28.799> down

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.770 

so<00:02:42.680> now<00:02:42.800> I'm<00:02:42.890> just<00:02:43.010> going<00:02:43.100> to<00:02:43.250> get<00:02:43.340> some<00:02:43.400> more

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
so now I'm just going to get some more

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:49.080 
so now I'm just going to get some more
ammo

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.830 

otherwise<00:02:49.840> it<00:02:50.080> could<00:02:50.260> be<00:02:50.349> playing<00:02:50.790> anyway

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.630 

I'm<00:02:55.379> just<00:02:55.590> going<00:02:55.769> to<00:02:55.830> define<00:02:56.190> another<00:02:56.340> riot
