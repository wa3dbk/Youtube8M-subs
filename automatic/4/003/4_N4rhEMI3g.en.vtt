00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
nine they use teams you know is

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.050 
nine they use teams you know is
dependent<00:01:09.130> on<00:01:09.160> the<00:01:09.280> weak<00:01:09.430> you<00:01:09.640> know<00:01:09.730> Pacers

best team to me that I've seen so far
this<00:01:59.830> year<00:02:00.280> I<00:02:00.720> think<00:02:01.720> Chicago<00:02:02.260> Bulls<00:02:02.530> are

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
this year I think Chicago Bulls are

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.560 
this year I think Chicago Bulls are
gonna<00:02:02.890> win<00:02:03.040> the<00:02:03.160> East<00:02:03.280> even<00:02:04.270> though<00:02:04.390> even

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
gonna win the East even though even

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.180 
gonna win the East even though even
though<00:02:04.780> you<00:02:04.870> have<00:02:05.050> the<00:02:05.200> magic<00:02:05.410> number<00:02:05.920> one<00:02:06.100> I

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
though you have the magic number one I

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.700 
though you have the magic number one I
think<00:02:06.250> no<00:02:06.580> this<00:02:06.850> was<00:02:07.210> their<00:02:07.540> records<00:02:07.990> okay<00:02:08.649> so

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 
think no this was their records okay so

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:10.590 
think no this was their records okay so
okay<00:02:09.039> so<00:02:09.280> but<00:02:09.670> you<00:02:09.789> think<00:02:10.000> ultimately<00:02:10.180> the

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
okay so but you think ultimately the

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.320 
okay so but you think ultimately the
Bulls<00:02:10.840> will<00:02:11.080> come

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
Bulls will come

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.800 
Bulls will come
the<00:02:11.510> each<00:02:11.690> I<00:02:11.960> do<00:02:12.200> I<00:02:12.650> think<00:02:13.190> that<00:02:13.460> I<00:02:13.730> love<00:02:14.150> what

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
the each I do I think that I love what

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.540 
the each I do I think that I love what
they're<00:02:14.990> doing<00:02:15.050> in<00:02:15.440> Chicago<00:02:15.890> I<00:02:16.070> think<00:02:16.400> they're

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
they're doing in Chicago I think they're

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:17.050 
they're doing in Chicago I think they're
magic

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
magic

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.670 
magic
I<00:02:17.090> think<00:02:17.360> they<00:02:17.450> got<00:02:17.600> the<00:02:17.780> deepest<00:02:18.140> team<00:02:18.350> in<00:02:18.560> the

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
I think they got the deepest team in the

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.500 
I think they got the deepest team in the
East<00:02:18.830> the<00:02:19.460> sentence<00:02:19.820> got<00:02:19.940> the<00:02:20.060> oldest<00:02:20.330> team<00:02:20.450> in

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
East the sentence got the oldest team in

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.180 
East the sentence got the oldest team in
the<00:02:20.630> heat<00:02:20.780> gonna<00:02:20.990> struggle<00:02:21.350> but<00:02:22.070> they're

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
the heat gonna struggle but they're

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:23.920 
the heat gonna struggle but they're
gonna<00:02:22.310> get<00:02:22.490> it<00:02:22.610> together<00:02:22.700> but<00:02:23.450> I<00:02:23.480> think<00:02:23.570> that

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
gonna get it together but I think that

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.660 
gonna get it together but I think that
lando<00:02:24.260> magic<00:02:24.650> don't<00:02:24.830> have<00:02:24.950> the<00:02:25.100> best<00:02:25.370> record

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
lando magic don't have the best record

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.180 
lando magic don't have the best record
but<00:02:26.420> I<00:02:26.480> think<00:02:26.720> the<00:02:26.840> most<00:02:27.020> dangerous<00:02:27.260> team<00:02:27.890> in

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
but I think the most dangerous team in

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.980 
but I think the most dangerous team in
the<00:02:28.400> Eastern<00:02:28.730> Conference<00:02:28.910> in<00:02:29.210> Chicago<00:02:29.750> Bulls

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
the Eastern Conference in Chicago Bulls

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:32.260 
the Eastern Conference in Chicago Bulls
I<00:02:30.110> think<00:02:30.320> that<00:02:30.500> specially<00:02:31.070> once<00:02:31.400> they<00:02:32.030> get

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
I think that specially once they get

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.440 
I think that specially once they get
Boozer<00:02:32.660> young<00:02:33.170> too<00:02:33.530> quick<00:02:33.860> to<00:02:34.370> get<00:02:34.550> to<00:02:34.910> the<00:02:35.000> to

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
Boozer young too quick to get to the to

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:36.460 
Boozer young too quick to get to the to
get<00:02:35.630> out<00:02:35.840> of<00:02:35.990> the<00:02:36.110> East

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
get out of the East

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.590 
get out of the East
but<00:02:37.010> Eastern<00:02:37.430> Conference<00:02:37.820> Finals<00:02:38.150> not<00:02:38.300> out<00:02:38.480> of

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
but Eastern Conference Finals not out of

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.720 
but Eastern Conference Finals not out of
there
