00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.370
 hello everyone and welcome to a new 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.370
 hall 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.740
 never 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.860
 if it's the first time that you are 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.869
 seeing I am patriotic and I would love that 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:19.970
 subscribe to this channel and if you are already 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:20.510
 part of this family I send thousands of 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.970
 Kisses 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.950
 Today I bring you the bidding of the month of 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.330
 July is another one that I will show you all 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.140
 the moneries that have arrived at my house 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.550
 during this month 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.289
 The first thing that I am going to teach you is a 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.540
 gift that came to me by surprise from 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.309
 part of alba lopez walls and is more 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.140
 beyond the black gold of this castle 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:38.480
 we had been together talking about things 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.010
 very interesting through facebook and 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.260
 a day of the overnight took me 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.019
 This preciousness is a book very very 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.909
 finite because he barely has 108 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:48.710
 pages the lyrics are quite big and 

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:51.110
 It is also an illustrated edition 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.239
 It's pretty pretty, it seems like a detail 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.739
 very nice something I liked you already know that no 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.900
 you should have given me nothing and that 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.549
 come by surprise it 's like three times 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.019
 better so in a few days 

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:01.460
 I hope to tell you on facebook that I 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:03.440
 appears from the novel and can debate 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.850
 together on those topics that we like 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.270
 so I'll tell you and thank you very much 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.770
 heart now 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.960
 one thing that had to have been taught 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.359
 during boxwood the month of June but 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.100
 I forgot to show them and I'm sorry and 

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:15.539
 is this lovely gift from here that I 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.520
 it came from one of my friends who 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:21.370
 it's called smooth and I'll show it to you 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.830
 because it's really a moniker to look at 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:25.870
 an image of red shirt and from behind 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.430
 is a mirror is not that extension of the 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.140
 camera was a gift that was going to make me 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.850
 for Christmas that came six more months 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.470
 late but the detail is what counts 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.820
 it's really lovely I know he did it 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.710
 thinking of me because it's a Little Red Riding Hood 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.240
 and now I have this mirror that always 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.010
 I'm asking in the bag and it's a 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.270
 cute really thank you now I'm going to 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.160
 teach two movies that I bought 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.690
 during the month of June the first of 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.520
 she is aunt shadows hunter of 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.990
 bone I bought it through amazon I think 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.210
 which is also super offer because I 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.130
 cost four euros or so and the truth is 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.750
 which is a normal edition on our dvd 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.250
 king or anything like that because no 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.960
 I have bluray but I've talked about 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.610
 the movie previously I do not know if in a 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.620
 good video a blog post now 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.120
 same I do not remember the movie as 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.280
 film adaptation I thought 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.720
 pretty bad in terms of what they do 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.640
 a lot of spoilers of what are the 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.200
 later novels in terms of effects 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.090
 specials leaves a little bit to be desired is 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.500
 I imagined something much bigger without 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.910
 But if you 've never heard the books 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.770
 movie well it's pretty good as 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.510
 usually happens in most cases and 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.980
 I wanted to have it on DVD because it's from 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.900
 these typical adaptation movies 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.250
 Well, I want to have it on DVD though 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.780
 then they 're going to take the series and I'll have to 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.190
 buy me the series and it will be very 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.350
 I miss the next thing that I'm going to 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.460
 teaching is the bluray of now you see me is 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.380
 one of the best 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.420
 I've seen lately I liked it very much 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.340
 and I incredibly enjoyed the truth 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.660
 that knew all the actors michael 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.760
 I began to see why it was from 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.990
 michael caine I adore this man and 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.700
 the truth is that the movie was 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.860
 incredible to me I liked it I recommend it 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.480
 and you will be wondering where you end up 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.310
 to say that you do not have bluray because you 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.780
 Buying a bluray buys me the blu-ray 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.950
 because it was on offer and because it is a 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.810
 movie that stay and sister too 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.150
 he likes it so what I'll have to do 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.430
 to see it will be to go to my house 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.350
 sister and see her there with her because if 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.390
 I do not have any way of seeing it right now 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.190
 we show the editorial shipments of 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.750
 part of oxford university press me 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.540
 the great gatsby of scott arrives 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.700
 fitzgerald had a lot of desire to 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.770
 read this novel everyone had me 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.270
 recommended that he read the great gatsby and 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.830
 I had never given him a chance or 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:13.210
 even Spanish or not to apply 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.070
 exemplary I thought it was a novel 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.140
 adapted by levels of which soil 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.180
 apply for oxford university press without 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.800
 However, it is the complete and complete novel 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.600
 and as you can see the cover is 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.190
 absolutely beautiful I fell in love with 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.990
 she is a pretty finite i do not know 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.170
 exactly in Spanish how many pages 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:31.450
 has but here is 144 and how can you 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.069
 see is my current reading and the second 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:37.499
 novel that comes to me from oxford university 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:39.670
 and three is drácula of bram stoker drácula 

00:03:37.499 --> 00:03:41.590
 for the first time at fourteen or fifteen 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.150
 years or so when he arrived by 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.010
 first time in my hands a copy of 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.840
 you will move or even when fish and read 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.189
 stephanie meyer I do not know but good in 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:50.049
 that moment was like a big boom 

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:51.489
 vampiric and I wanted to get the 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:53.260
 exemplary dracula of this great classic 

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:55.150
 in the original version because I have it in 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.769
 Spanish but I wanted it in English and the 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.209
 truth is that it will be one of my next 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.859
 your readings this summer and I have you 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:01.389
 very much desire so I will tell you 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:02.950
 the next copy comes to me from part 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:04.569
 of rock and is the heiress that is the 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.400
 fourth part of the saga of want cash 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:07.900
 I do not have any of the three copies 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.519
 previous of this saga because I am 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.379
 taking from the library or taking them 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:12.760
 borrowed from other friends but the truth 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:14.349
 is that I really wanted to have 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.900
 at least one of these issues so 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:18.549
 precious on my shelves the heiress 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.199
 is a copy that I have already read I will be 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:21.849
 taught on the blog but none of 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:24.070
 the books after the selection goes 

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:26.169
 to overcome the first volume of this saga 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.849
 I think that book was magnificent this 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:29.349
 book has disappointed me enough because 

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:31.419
 is an exact copy of what is the 

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:33.160
 first volume of this saga only that 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:34.690
 we change the character for fun of 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.009
 read I will not deny it but I expected 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.150
 much more about him I will teach you the 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:40.000
 edition 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:43.030
 of soft cover with flaps and has a 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.890
 total of 316 pages the letter is huge 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.690
 so it's going to sound a little more of him 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:47.650
 in the wrap of the month of July the same 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.720
 editorial also reaches me the 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.980
 short stories selection the prince and 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.080
 the guardian who is also from want 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:55.180
 cash this book I had already read it because 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.310
 I bought it for the kindle when it came out in 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.140
 usa this book is entangled in first 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:00.910
 place from the point of view of mac are 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.890
 as prince of the selection and in 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:04.810
 second place as aspen which is the 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.610
 first boyfriend who has america when 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.660
 begins the selection and the next thing that 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.300
 I'm going to show you that I get a part 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:12.160
 of destination is the complete trilogy of 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.080
 Shadowhunters the origins 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.670
 after posting here on the channel a 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.800
 video about the sagas I intended 

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:19.930
 finish this summer had included the 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.180
 sixth volume of Shadowhunters and in 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.070
 99 9% of the comments that I 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.570
 you left me warned jce that please 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:28.180
 I did not read the last volume of the saga 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:29.770
 principal without having read the trilogy of 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.810
 the origins because I'm going to do 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.400
 many spoilers so what I did was 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.930
 request the three copies to the 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.730
 editorial and once I finished them 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:38.860
 then to be able to read me finally the last volume 

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:40.450
 of shadow hunters so I want to 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.449
 those very current books I'm going to teach 

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.830
 the editions 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:44.240
 because the truth is that one thing that 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.580
 I love this editorial and about 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.409
 all of these two sagas of books are 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.300
 issues that are really beautiful 

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:52.129
 As you already know, the trilogy begins with 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:54.409
 mechanical angel that the truth is that the 

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:56.389
 cover has fascinated me I will teach 

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:58.819
 a little the editing as you can see is 

00:05:56.389 --> 00:06:01.099
 hardcover with over covers 

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:04.009
 inside is black and here's the spine with 

00:06:01.099 --> 00:06:07.729
 the title blank and inside it has 

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:10.789
 a total of 440 pages and the letter is 

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:12.379
 absolutely huge huge huge the 

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:14.150
 trilogy continued with the beginning 

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:16.039
 mechanic in the second part and good 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:17.719
 last and closing the trilogy we have 

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:19.249
 mechanical princess definitely not 

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:21.439
 this is the best cover of the three is 

00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:23.629
 as in reddish orange tones I 

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:24.469
 love is really lovely the one

 they think to do something pretty 

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:27.949
 interesting here in the channel is about

00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:33.050
 commented that this trilogy is a thousand times 

00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:34.580
 better to the main saga and that to me 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:36.289
 personally I will like it much more 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:38.120

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:40.490
 in the Victorian era and you know that a 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.050
