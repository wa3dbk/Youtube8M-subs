just<00:02:06.779> about<00:02:06.810> anything<00:02:07.139> except<00:02:07.469> all<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.649> time

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
just about anything except all the time

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.690

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.140 
so doesn't have a camera no it doesn't
but<00:03:59.019> what<00:03:59.200> it<00:03:59.290> does<00:03:59.500> do<00:03:59.739> is<00:04:00.340> it<00:04:00.400> has<00:04:00.700> a<00:04:00.730> camera

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
but what it does do is it has a camera

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.360 
but what it does do is it has a camera
app<00:04:01.450> that<00:04:01.870> lets<00:04:02.080> this<00:04:02.379> act<00:04:02.709> as<00:04:02.950> the<00:04:03.099> viewfinder

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.370 
app that lets this act as the viewfinder

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.059 
app that lets this act as the viewfinder
for<00:04:04.239> that<00:04:04.510> camera<00:04:04.900> so<00:04:05.440> what<00:04:05.590> we're<00:04:05.739> saying<00:04:05.890> is

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:06.069 
for that camera so what we're saying is

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:07.740 
for that camera so what we're saying is
for<00:04:06.280> the<00:04:06.340> first<00:04:06.459> time<00:04:06.610> in<00:04:06.819> our<00:04:06.910> lives<00:04:07.090> we<00:04:07.720> can

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
for the first time in our lives we can

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.780 
for the first time in our lives we can
use<00:04:08.080> the<00:04:08.260> good<00:04:08.590> camera<00:04:08.980> on<00:04:09.129> the<00:04:09.220> back<00:04:09.400> of<00:04:09.640> this

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
use the good camera on the back of this

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.420 
use the good camera on the back of this
and<00:04:10.060> just<00:04:10.540> frame<00:04:10.900> the<00:04:10.930> shot<00:04:11.319> with<00:04:11.980> this<00:04:12.160> so<00:04:12.370> we

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
and just frame the shot with this so we

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:18.180 
and just frame the shot with this so we
can<00:04:12.580> take<00:04:12.700> a<00:04:12.730> selfie<00:04:13.170> breathe<00:04:14.170> do<00:04:14.709> what<00:04:17.100> but<00:04:18.100> it
