00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400

once<00:05:46.730> you<00:05:46.850> try<00:05:47.060> this<00:05:47.120> you're<00:05:47.480> not<00:05:47.510> going<00:05:47.810> to<00:05:47.870> go

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 
once you try this you're not going to go

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.410 
once you try this you're not going to go

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:50.420 
back on it is pretty pricey and I think

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:51.880 
back on it is pretty pricey and I think
that's<00:05:50.570> why<00:05:50.690> people<00:05:50.720> don't<00:05:51.140> buy<00:05:51.290> it<00:05:51.350> but<00:05:51.650> it's

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:51.890
