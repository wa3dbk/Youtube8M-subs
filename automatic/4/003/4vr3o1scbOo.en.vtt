looking at some kind of interactive
interface<00:00:27.660> if<00:00:28.199> we<00:00:29.160> freeze<00:00:29.429> frame<00:00:29.760> here<00:00:30.060> then

interface if we freeze frame here then

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.540 
interface if we freeze frame here then
we<00:00:30.359> see<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.660> letters<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:31.109> R<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:31.830> K<00:00:31.859> which

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
we see the letters a R and K which

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.880 
we see the letters a R and K which
appears<00:00:32.969> after<00:00:33.149> each<00:00:33.480> slide<00:00:33.870> which<00:00:34.410> fits<00:00:34.710> in

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
appears after each slide which fits in

with<00:00:35.040> this<00:00:35.219> picture<00:00:35.550> that<00:00:35.850> was<00:00:35.940> tweeted<00:00:36.329> out

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
with this picture that was tweeted out

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.350 
with this picture that was tweeted out
by<00:00:36.600> a<00:00:36.630> bioware<00:00:37.079> developer<00:00:37.500> some<00:00:37.739> time<00:00:37.980> ago<00:00:38.360> it

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
by a bioware developer some time ago it

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.020 
by a bioware developer some time ago it
seems<00:00:39.570> that<00:00:39.750> arc<00:00:40.020> or<00:00:40.410> arc<00:00:40.800> Khan<00:00:41.250> is<00:00:41.520> going<00:00:41.910> to

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
seems that arc or arc Khan is going to

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.299 
seems that arc or arc Khan is going to
be<00:00:42.149> some<00:00:42.420> kind<00:00:42.450> of<00:00:42.750> leading<00:00:43.020> military

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309 
be some kind of leading military

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:46.130 
be some kind of leading military
organization<00:00:44.309> certainly<00:00:45.270> one<00:00:45.420> of<00:00:45.450> importance

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
organization certainly one of importance

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.060 
organization certainly one of importance
in<00:00:46.350> any<00:00:46.530> case<00:00:47.660> the<00:00:48.660> next<00:00:48.930> slide<00:00:49.110> shows<00:00:49.140> an<00:00:49.649> icy

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
in any case the next slide shows an icy

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.069 
in any case the next slide shows an icy
looking<00:00:50.370> planet<00:00:50.730> though<00:00:51.300> there<00:00:51.510> is<00:00:51.660> flowing

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
looking planet though there is flowing

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.590 
looking planet though there is flowing
water<00:00:52.320> next<00:00:52.710> to<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:52.949> reddish<00:00:53.370> cave<00:00:53.699> which<00:00:54.270> does

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
water next to a reddish cave which does

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.000 
water next to a reddish cave which does
suggest<00:00:54.809> that<00:00:55.079> it's<00:00:55.289> not<00:00:55.500> completely

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
suggest that it's not completely

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.180 
suggest that it's not completely
uninhabitable<00:00:57.500> after<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:58.649> we<00:00:58.980> see<00:00:59.160> a

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
uninhabitable after that we see a

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.040 
uninhabitable after that we see a
poisonous<00:00:59.730> looking<00:01:00.030> planet<00:01:00.390> though<00:01:00.719> there<00:01:00.899> is

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
poisonous looking planet though there is

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.439 
poisonous looking planet though there is
plant<00:01:01.379> life<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.800> large<00:01:02.129> space<00:01:02.550> beetles<00:01:03.030> so

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
plant life and large space beetles so

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.590 
plant life and large space beetles so
again<00:01:03.899> there's<00:01:04.260> signs<00:01:04.500> of<00:01:04.680> life<00:01:04.860> here<00:01:05.600> the

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
again there's signs of life here the

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.690 
again there's signs of life here the
next<00:01:06.750> slide<00:01:07.080> is<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.650> rocky<00:01:08.100> looking<00:01:08.369> planet

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
next slide is a rocky looking planet

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.580 
next slide is a rocky looking planet
with<00:01:08.909> zero<00:01:09.180> gravity<00:01:09.450> not<00:01:10.020> much<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.380> see<00:01:10.560> here

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
with zero gravity not much to see here

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.160 
with zero gravity not much to see here
and<00:01:11.030> next<00:01:12.030> we<00:01:12.119> have<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.330> lush<00:01:12.780> looking

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
and next we have a lush looking

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.140 
and next we have a lush looking
environment<00:01:13.740> with<00:01:14.010> plenty<00:01:14.430> of<00:01:14.490> plants<00:01:14.970> and

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
environment with plenty of plants and

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.719 
environment with plenty of plants and
animal<00:01:15.509> life<00:01:16.009> there's<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.100> huge<00:01:17.430> flying

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
animal life there's a huge flying

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.520 
animal life there's a huge flying
creature<00:01:18.119> which<00:01:18.479> does<00:01:18.720> look<00:01:18.930> like<00:01:19.080> it's<00:01:19.290> some

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
creature which does look like it's some

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.330 
creature which does look like it's some
kind<00:01:19.860> of<00:01:19.979> huge<00:01:20.280> alien<00:01:20.549> life-form<00:01:22.070> the<00:01:23.070> screen

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
kind of huge alien life-form the screen

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.550 
kind of huge alien life-form the screen
pans<00:01:23.610> out<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.150> then<00:01:24.360> we<00:01:24.540> see<00:01:24.750> that<00:01:24.930> an<00:01:25.229> armored

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
pans out and then we see that an armored

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.950 
pans out and then we see that an armored
hand<00:01:25.799> is<00:01:26.040> swiping<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.670> screen<00:01:26.700> across<00:01:27.180> this

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
hand is swiping the screen across this

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.109 
hand is swiping the screen across this
time<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.560> volcanic<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.369> stormy<00:01:29.820> looking

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
time to a volcanic and stormy looking

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.359 
time to a volcanic and stormy looking
environment<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:30.930> then<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:31.619> swipes<00:01:31.920> back<00:01:32.189> to

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
environment and then it swipes back to

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.240 
environment and then it swipes back to
the<00:01:32.490> original<00:01:32.790> desert<00:01:33.180> environment<00:01:34.250> one

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
the original desert environment one

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.800 
the original desert environment one
thing<00:01:35.430> I<00:01:35.520> noticed<00:01:35.880> was<00:01:36.030> that<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.329> scanner<00:01:36.600> was

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
thing I noticed was that the scanner was

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.899 
thing I noticed was that the scanner was
focused<00:01:37.259> on<00:01:37.350> geological<00:01:38.100> structures<00:01:38.729> in

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
focused on geological structures in

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.539 
focused on geological structures in
every<00:01:39.210> single<00:01:39.420> one<00:01:39.720> of<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.960> slides<00:01:40.549> this

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
every single one of the slides this

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.399 
every single one of the slides this
seems<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.939> indicate<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.360> our<00:01:42.509> guys<00:01:42.930> looking

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
seems to indicate that our guys looking

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.899 
seems to indicate that our guys looking
for<00:01:43.560> something<00:01:43.799> contained<00:01:44.280> within<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.729> rocks

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
for something contained within the rocks

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.109 
for something contained within the rocks
