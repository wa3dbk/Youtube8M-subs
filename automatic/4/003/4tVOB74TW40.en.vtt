00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.399
 Because, to paraphrase an advertisement: “Image is everything! 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:31.910
 Thirst is nothing, ”but image is everything. 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.329
 Why? Because, as they say in the East, on what 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:37.100
 we focus, so we become. 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.460
 And with the help of this visual summary, 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.719
 with your image you can really create 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:46.120
 your own reality. How? How? 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.680
 First of all, through what ?, - through color. Colour 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.690
 - in general, it is simply of tremendous importance in our 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.989
 of life! Colossal! This is a physical phenomenon. 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.739
 And, you see, when you go out in the morning 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:02.899
 on a fine spring day and see instead of the fine 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:06.780
 spring day gray sky that hides what 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.729
 should be, in general, a bright sun, then, accordingly, 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:12.040
 What is our mood doing? It is not very 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.990
 It is clear that our internal state - is, in the first 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.840
 turn, it is very important, what we have inside. 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.840
 But you can create your own mood 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.149
 Again with the help of color. 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:27.200
 Not wearing all the same gray or black that 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.200
 and so outside the window in large quantities present. 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.189
 As a resident of Petersburg, I can say that I admire 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:35.659
 (in quotes "admire") gray throughout 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:37.710
 winter and all spring. 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.909
 And if I didn’t have this knowledge of how 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:44.340
 You can create your own mood with the help of color personalization. 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.850
 Probably, I think, I am even sure that I would not be so 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.719
 positive! Honestly. Because every day 

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:54.899
 i create my own reality with those 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.799
 the flowers that I wear. 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:01.820
 Because there are colors that attract mood 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.920
 There are colors that completely remove this mood. 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.710
 When I want brightness and light, I put on everything 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:10.920
 which is associated with these brightness and light. I wear color 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.390
 sky, I put on the color of grass, I put on the color of the sun. 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.610
 I put on the water color because I am very 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:21.400
 I want to have to the sea. 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.750
 Just these colors are still very relevant this season. 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.070
 And when you create your own mood every day, 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.870
 it is certainly present in your life. And manifests itself 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.360
 very good events, good meetings, meetings 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.620
 with bright people, positive people, and not with gloomy people. 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.040
 This is the same as the practice of feng shui. when we speak 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.680
 about the harmonization of a sector - with what: 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.190
 color, shape, element. 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.050
 When we need to strengthen the metal, we add here 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.150
 white, if the tree - we, respectively, add 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.670
 green color, rectangular shapes. Similarly, clothing: 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.310
 it will create your inner feng shui for you. 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.730
 When you know what color your eyes are, what 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.050
 colors your hair - what they are and what they are better 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.000
 do in order to improve the complexion and, accordingly, 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.370
 your own mood. 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.250
 When you know exactly when you need makeup 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.970

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.340

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.400
