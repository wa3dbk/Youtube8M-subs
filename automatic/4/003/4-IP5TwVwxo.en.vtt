not have a battery cover and it keeps
slipping<00:00:36.860> out<00:00:36.980> that's<00:00:37.430> why<00:00:37.550> I've<00:00:37.610> got<00:00:37.730> my

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
slipping out that's why I've got my

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.290 
slipping out that's why I've got my
charger<00:00:38.180> here<00:00:38.360> um<00:00:39.309> but<00:00:40.309> anyways<00:00:40.640> let's<00:00:41.059> just

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
charger here um but anyways let's just

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.210 
charger here um but anyways let's just
show<00:00:42.170> you<00:00:42.230> that<00:00:42.440> I'm<00:00:42.530> an<00:00:42.680> official<00:00:43.040> firmware

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:43.220 
show you that I'm an official firmware

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.640 
show you that I'm an official firmware
as<00:00:43.640> you<00:00:44.330> don't<00:00:44.510> need<00:00:44.720> custom<00:00:45.140> phone<00:00:45.320> with<00:00:45.530> to

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:45.650 
as you don't need custom phone with to

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.140 
as you don't need custom phone with to
make<00:00:45.769> this<00:00:45.890> work<00:00:46.129> because<00:00:46.519> if<00:00:46.760> you<00:00:46.879> are<00:00:47.030> on

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:47.150 
make this work because if you are on

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:48.520 
make this work because if you are on
custom<00:00:47.449> firmware<00:00:47.809> there's<00:00:47.989> no<00:00:48.110> need<00:00:48.320> for<00:00:48.350> the

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
custom firmware there's no need for the

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.259 
custom firmware there's no need for the
HDL<00:00:49.120> so<00:00:51.370> right<00:00:52.370> now<00:00:52.400> as<00:00:52.699> you<00:00:52.820> can<00:00:52.879> see<00:00:52.940> on<00:00:53.150> one

00:00:53.259 --> 00:00:53.269 
HDL so right now as you can see on one

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:58.810 
HDL so right now as you can see on one
6.60<00:00:54.220> and<00:00:56.019> now<00:00:57.019> what<00:00:57.170> we<00:00:57.290> can<00:00:57.409> do<00:00:57.530> is<00:00:57.769> is<00:00:58.070> simply

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
6.60 and now what we can do is is simply

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.689 
6.60 and now what we can do is is simply
go<00:00:59.000> to<00:00:59.030> UM<00:01:00.159> your<00:01:01.330> game<00:01:02.330> part<00:01:02.659> of<00:01:02.720> the<00:01:02.839> xmb<00:01:03.260> and

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:03.699 
go to UM your game part of the xmb and

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:08.080 
go to UM your game part of the xmb and
just<00:01:04.699> open<00:01:05.000> up<00:01:05.180> memory<00:01:05.479> stick<00:01:05.750> so<00:01:06.440> I've<00:01:07.090> got

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
just open up memory stick so I've got

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.120 
just open up memory stick so I've got
many<00:01:08.810> applications<00:01:09.380> here<00:01:10.659> including<00:01:12.130> this

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
many applications here including this

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.069 
many applications here including this
which<00:01:13.759> is<00:01:13.969> a<00:01:15.130> super<00:01:16.130> nintendo<00:01:16.310> emulator<00:01:17.180> sup

00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:18.079 
which is a super nintendo emulator sup

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:20.590 
which is a super nintendo emulator sup
like<00:01:18.259> that<00:01:18.759> and<00:01:19.759> all<00:01:19.969> these<00:01:20.090> are<00:01:20.299> the<00:01:20.420> ones

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
like that and all these are the ones

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.760 
like that and all these are the ones
will<00:01:20.930> not<00:01:20.960> work<00:01:21.229> with<00:01:21.670> hbl<00:01:22.670> hbl<00:01:23.350> has<00:01:24.350> its<00:01:24.590> own

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
will not work with hbl hbl has its own

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.980 
will not work with hbl hbl has its own
apps<00:01:25.070> that<00:01:25.280> will<00:01:25.340> work<00:01:25.549> with<00:01:25.789> it<00:01:25.939> so<00:01:26.210> these

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
apps that will work with it so these

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.529 
apps that will work with it so these
ones<00:01:27.320> right<00:01:27.439> now<00:01:27.770> you<00:01:27.829> can<00:01:28.100> ignore<00:01:28.359> this<00:01:29.359> is

00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:29.539 
ones right now you can ignore this is

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:30.730 
ones right now you can ignore this is
the<00:01:29.600> only<00:01:29.719> one<00:01:29.960> that<00:01:30.020> will<00:01:30.200> work<00:01:30.320> with<00:01:30.530> this

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
the only one that will work with this

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.950 
the only one that will work with this
and<00:01:31.009> you<00:01:31.880> can<00:01:31.909> simply<00:01:32.119> open<00:01:32.270> up<00:01:32.570> hpl<00:01:34.450> what<00:01:35.450> hbl

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
and you can simply open up hpl what hbl

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.630 
and you can simply open up hpl what hbl
basically<00:01:36.409> is<00:01:36.590> it<00:01:36.770> lets<00:01:37.100> you<00:01:37.219> open<00:01:37.369> up<00:01:37.579> the

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
basically is it lets you open up the

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.889 
basically is it lets you open up the
corrupted<00:01:38.149> data<00:01:38.329> are<00:01:38.600> um<00:01:39.070> inside<00:01:40.070> your<00:01:40.630> xmb<00:01:41.630> so

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
corrupted data are um inside your xmb so

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:43.690 
corrupted data are um inside your xmb so
if<00:01:42.020> you<00:01:42.109> try<00:01:42.259> opening<00:01:42.439> up<00:01:42.799> any<00:01:43.100> of<00:01:43.250> those<00:01:43.399> files

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:43.700 
if you try opening up any of those files

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.840 
if you try opening up any of those files
you'll<00:01:44.570> come<00:01:44.780> up<00:01:44.810> with<00:01:45.189> crop<00:01:46.189> today<00:01:46.429> art<00:01:46.670> and

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
you'll come up with crop today art and

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.240 
you'll come up with crop today art and
you<00:01:47.179> cannot<00:01:47.600> really<00:01:48.049> use<00:01:48.200> them<00:01:48.679> unless<00:01:48.859> you

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
you cannot really use them unless you

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.840 
you cannot really use them unless you
use<00:01:49.399> hbl<00:01:50.710> but<00:01:51.710> it<00:01:51.890> will<00:01:51.979> only<00:01:52.100> work<00:01:52.399> with<00:01:52.579> some

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
use hbl but it will only work with some

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.760 
use hbl but it will only work with some
apps<00:01:53.090> and<00:01:53.390> not<00:01:53.659> all<00:01:53.899> of<00:01:54.049> them<00:01:54.170> that's<00:01:54.649> the

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
apps and not all of them that's the

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.679 
apps and not all of them that's the
downside<00:01:54.979> but<00:01:55.429> that's<00:01:55.729> all<00:01:55.909> there<00:01:56.030> is<00:01:56.060> that's

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
downside but that's all there is that's

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:59.109 
downside but that's all there is that's
the<00:01:56.780> only<00:01:57.020> thing<00:01:57.280> and<00:01:58.280> as<00:01:58.579> you<00:01:58.670> can<00:01:58.789> see<00:01:58.820> here

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
the only thing and as you can see here

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:00.969 
the only thing and as you can see here
I've<00:01:59.299> got<00:01:59.329> a<00:01:59.929> list<00:02:00.200> of<00:02:00.380> everything<00:02:00.679> that's

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
I've got a list of everything that's

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.289 
I've got a list of everything that's
inside<00:02:01.420> my<00:02:02.420> game<00:02:02.600> folder<00:02:03.700> this<00:02:04.700> should<00:02:04.969> just

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
inside my game folder this should just

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:09.520 
inside my game folder this should just
autofocus<00:02:07.450> ok<00:02:08.450> so<00:02:08.810> as<00:02:09.080> you<00:02:09.200> can<00:02:09.289> see<00:02:09.440> it's

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
autofocus ok so as you can see it's

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.250 
autofocus ok so as you can see it's
everything<00:02:09.920> that<00:02:09.950> was<00:02:10.250> in<00:02:10.369> there<00:02:10.580> and<00:02:10.960> this<00:02:11.960> is

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
the super nintendo emulator this is made

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.490 
the super nintendo emulator this is made
for<00:02:15.290> how<00:02:15.650> the<00:02:16.160> heck<00:02:16.430> half<00:02:16.880> byte<00:02:17.150> loader<00:02:17.500> hpl

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
for how the heck half byte loader hpl

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.860 
for how the heck half byte loader hpl
and<00:02:18.740> you<00:02:19.280> simply<00:02:19.520> just<00:02:19.670> click<00:02:19.940> that<00:02:20.060> with<00:02:20.570> X

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
and you simply just click that with X

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.780 
and you simply just click that with X
and<00:02:21.170> it<00:02:21.290> should<00:02:21.560> just<00:02:21.830> start<00:02:22.040> up<00:02:22.220> and<00:02:22.430> it

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
and it should just start up and it

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.449 
and it should just start up and it
which<00:02:22.939> would<00:02:23.120> work<00:02:23.360> smoothly<00:02:26.560> so<00:02:27.560> I<00:02:27.920> put<00:02:28.280> one

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
which would work smoothly so I put one

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.550 
which would work smoothly so I put one

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:33.349 
probably understand it then but it will

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:36.520 
probably understand it then but it will
work<00:03:33.560> exactly<00:03:33.949> like<00:03:34.099> this<00:03:34.540> all<00:03:35.540> exactly<00:03:36.260> might

work exactly like this all exactly might
be<00:03:36.680> some<00:03:37.459> changes<00:03:37.879> there<00:03:38.209> might<00:03:38.599> be<00:03:38.629> some

will get homebrew on this soon on that I
mean<00:03:55.669> so<00:03:56.329> we've<00:03:56.540> got<00:03:56.720> it<00:03:56.810> on<00:03:56.900> here<00:03:57.139> as<00:03:57.620> you<00:03:57.859> can

see I've only got one game unless you

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:01.119 
see I've only got one game unless you
have<00:03:59.449> a<00:03:59.479> look<00:03:59.690> if<00:03:59.840> it<00:03:59.959> works<00:04:00.199> so<00:04:01.010> I'll<00:04:01.099> just

00:04:01.119 --> 00:04:01.129 
have a look if it works so I'll just

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:05.589 
have a look if it works so I'll just
clicked<00:04:01.519> it<00:04:03.519> good<00:04:04.519> work<00:04:04.729> why<00:04:05.030> I<00:04:05.060> don't<00:04:05.419> know

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:05.599 
clicked it good work why I don't know

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:07.119 
clicked it good work why I don't know
what<00:04:05.989> I<00:04:06.199> got<00:04:06.439> what's<00:04:06.560> to<00:04:06.650> see<00:04:06.769> at<00:04:06.889> the<00:04:06.949> bottom

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:07.129 
what I got what's to see at the bottom

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:09.610 
what I got what's to see at the bottom
this<00:04:07.699> is<00:04:07.790> the<00:04:07.909> first<00:04:08.090> time<00:04:08.209> i'm<00:04:08.389> using<00:04:08.689> this<00:04:08.840> ok

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
this is the first time i'm using this ok

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.199 
this is the first time i'm using this ok
so<00:04:09.680> circle<00:04:10.129> to<00:04:10.250> run<00:04:10.400> this<00:04:10.579> pressure<00:04:10.819> was

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
so circle to run this pressure was

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:17.259 
so circle to run this pressure was
pressing<00:04:11.449> X<00:04:12.129> so<00:04:13.129> it<00:04:13.250> should<00:04:13.430> just<00:04:13.609> do<00:04:13.699> this<00:04:16.269> ok

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
pressing X so it should just do this ok

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:22.129 
pressing X so it should just do this ok
so<00:04:17.329> it<00:04:17.539> should<00:04:17.720> just<00:04:17.930> start<00:04:18.079> up<00:04:20.139> yes

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 
so it should just start up yes
