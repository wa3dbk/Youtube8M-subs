00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
now there is a bit of noise this isn't

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.800

completely silent as you can hear that
this<00:03:16.200> right<00:03:16.650> now<00:03:16.829> it's<00:03:17.010> at<00:03:17.129> the<00:03:17.250> highest<00:03:17.579> speed

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
this right now it's at the highest speed

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:21.470 
this right now it's at the highest speed
and<00:03:19.400> once<00:03:20.400> you<00:03:20.519> turn<00:03:20.670> it<00:03:20.819> down<00:03:20.850> to<00:03:21.180> the<00:03:21.299> lowest

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.349 
and once you turn it down to the lowest
speed<00:03:21.750> it's<00:03:22.380> really<00:03:22.620> not<00:03:22.769> that<00:03:22.829> bad<00:03:23.239> but<00:03:24.239> at

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359 
speed it's really not that bad but at

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:28.819 
speed it's really not that bad but at
the<00:03:24.480> high<00:03:24.630> speed<00:03:25.049> there<00:03:25.319> I<00:03:27.410> mean<00:03:28.410> unless<00:03:28.680> you

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
the high speed there I mean unless you

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:30.170 
the high speed there I mean unless you
have<00:03:28.859> a<00:03:28.950> headset<00:03:29.190> on<00:03:29.549> and<00:03:29.730> you're<00:03:29.819> doing<00:03:30.030> some

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:32.639 
heavy duty gaming that could be kind of

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:37.509 
heavy duty gaming that could be kind of
annoying

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519
