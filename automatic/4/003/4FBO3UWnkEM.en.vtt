00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:29.770
 I don't even know where to start for us all 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.610
 We were given a blank notebook 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.800
 a pencil 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:36.610
 and also ordered their diaries as 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.320
 possible more often so yes this is my first 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.129
 record and hope it doesn't turn out 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.129
 the last 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.250
 it's dark and rainy enough now 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.050
 storm is coming 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.750
 so cold and we can not dilute 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.350
 fire because we are too close the boundaries 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.050
 the enemy 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.239
 but I'm not complaining after so many days 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.699
 walk under the hot limb sun 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:04.970
 the rain became an incredible relief before 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:07.280
 Tomorrow my watch 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:11.020
 came to an end a couple of hours ago so have 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.820
 I have a whole night to get ready 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.979
 I think I should write something about 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.610
 past before going to tomorrow 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:23.509
 day I have a family beauty wife two 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.070
 kids brother and sister my age we 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:29.110
 we all live under the same roof 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:31.250
 everyone thinks about his but we are happy 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.380
 the last time we began to hear everything 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.210
 more history of strange creatures 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:39.289
 monsters appearing on our 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:41.360
 northeastern borders we did not pay 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:45.679
 this attention was thought to be a lie and 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.929
 impossible at all but we were wrong 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:49.399
 badly wrong 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:50.929
 after we lost our huge 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.410
 lightning fastness 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:57.580
 unknown enemy we are my brother I and 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:02:00.470
 sister was called the next day 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:03.679
 so we are sitting here in the hundreds in this 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:06.640
 dirt and silence in anticipation 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:09.800
 get the last order and advance 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.349
 I never held a sword in my hands 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.450
 never needed it in those times 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:16.190
 when we had problems with wolves I 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.069
 could chase them yelling and behaving 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.620
 like a drunken idiot but I think it is not 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:24.640
 will save me this time except if 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.769
 my enemies won't die laughing 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:31.519
 Fortunately, my brother and sister are not like me 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:33.800
 they are both awesome wars i hope i 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:37.550
 got some fighting skills from 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.190
 my dad I don't know where they are brother and 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.260
 sister 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.940
 with divided into three large groups so 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.640
 that i think we will defend ourselves or 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.470
 attack from three fronts 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.890
 I like my band I found a pair 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:55.360
 friends of jack and john and this mad 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:57.610
 girl liza we call willis they all 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:01.090
 equally unaware of all this as 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:03.250
 and I jack was my neighbor at all lived in 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:07.000
 neighboring village and john his very 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.830
 good friend we know nothing alice 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.700
 she was always silent but in extreme 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:14.890
 least smiled at us we agreed 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:19.150
 follow each other so this 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:23.140
 now my bank so to speak they all sleep 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:26.350
 at least I think they need and 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:29.860
 their strength i must sleep too but i'm strong 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:32.920
 nervous i can't stop thinking about 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.830
 that I heard a couple of hours ago after 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.630
 return from my watch 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.370
 when I passed by our commanders I 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.130
 heard them talk about construction 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:45.030
 several defensive towers I think this 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.500
 our task for tomorrow I hope so 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.590
 because I wanted to ask my friends 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:56.110
 teach me to hold a sword 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:58.959
 i should rather deal with it 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:02.470
 really going on war came on 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:04.720
 our peaceful lands and i'm part of it also 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.720
 like hundreds of my new friends lying 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.640
 chatting next to me i'm too 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.060
 scared to admit that few of 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.970
 they reach the end 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.669
 will return home to show diaries 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.169
 to their families 

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:21.230
 one of our commanders 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:23.840
 his name is bistmaster he can call 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:26.120
 hawk who will follow 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.480
 terrain so nobody gets into 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:31.820
 us unnoticed this night I will try 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:36.100
 talk to him tomorrow but for now i'm better 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.100
 rest wish me luck
