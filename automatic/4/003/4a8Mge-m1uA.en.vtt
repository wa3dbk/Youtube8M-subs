weather is like 45 40 to 45 degrees and
up<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.219> then<00:00:57.210> your<00:00:57.930> cold<00:00:58.289> weather<00:00:58.590> or<00:00:59.219> your

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
up and then your cold weather or your

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.080 
up and then your cold weather or your
three<00:00:59.609> season<00:00:59.969> is<00:01:00.059> like<00:01:00.239> 15<00:01:00.870> or<00:01:01.199> 20<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.489> 40<00:01:02.969> or

or<00:01:06.360> 10<00:01:06.630> degrees<00:01:06.990> below<00:01:07.490> okay<00:01:08.490> so<00:01:08.549> those<00:01:08.790> are

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
or 10 degrees below okay so those are

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.070 
or 10 degrees below okay so those are
the<00:01:08.970> three<00:01:09.030> it's<00:01:09.420> just<00:01:09.570> based<00:01:09.750> on<00:01:09.869> temperature

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
the three it's just based on temperature

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.350 
the three it's just based on temperature
rating<00:01:10.560> what<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.100> temperature<00:01:11.490> rating<00:01:11.790> is<00:01:12.060> is

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
rating what the temperature rating is is

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.710 
rating what the temperature rating is is
basically<00:01:12.780> you<00:01:13.560> will<00:01:13.680> be<00:01:13.860> comfortable<00:01:14.430> up<00:01:15.240> to

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
basically you will be comfortable up to

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.380 
basically you will be comfortable up to
whatever<00:01:16.290> degree<00:01:16.439> they<00:01:16.799> save<00:01:17.100> so<00:01:17.430> this<00:01:18.180> is<00:01:18.360> a

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
whatever degree they save so this is a

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.350 
whatever degree they save so this is a
40<00:01:19.200> 40<00:01:19.770> degree<00:01:20.040> fahrenheit<00:01:20.580> bag<00:01:20.880> which<00:01:21.119> means

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
40 40 degree fahrenheit bag which means

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.300 
40 40 degree fahrenheit bag which means
if<00:01:21.689> it<00:01:22.049> gets<00:01:22.200> down<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.380> 40<00:01:22.740> degrees<00:01:22.770> while<00:01:23.220> I'm

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
if it gets down to 40 degrees while I'm

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.399 
if it gets down to 40 degrees while I'm
sleeping<00:01:23.460> in<00:01:23.820> there<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.450> should<00:01:25.080> still<00:01:25.290> be

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
sleeping in there I should still be

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.170 
sleeping in there I should still be
comfortable<00:01:25.799> that's<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.640> comfort<00:01:27.030> rating

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
comfortable that's the comfort rating

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.050 
comfortable that's the comfort rating
safety<00:01:28.020> rating<00:01:28.380> they<00:01:29.159> usually<00:01:29.490> don't<00:01:29.610> publish

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
safety rating they usually don't publish

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.510 
safety rating they usually don't publish
that<00:01:30.240> openly<00:01:30.900> but<00:01:31.259> basically<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.740> means<00:01:31.770> you

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
that openly but basically it means you

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.060 
that openly but basically it means you
will<00:01:32.909> not<00:01:33.119> suffer<00:01:33.570> from<00:01:33.659> hypothermia<00:01:34.070> up

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
will not suffer from hypothermia up

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.310 
will not suffer from hypothermia up
until<00:01:35.430> a<00:01:35.700> few<00:01:35.759> degrees<00:01:36.060> under<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:36.689> right<00:01:36.990> so

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
until a few degrees under that right so

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.280 
until a few degrees under that right so
40<00:01:38.100> degrees<00:01:38.369> so<00:01:38.579> maybe<00:01:38.759> it's<00:01:38.939> like<00:01:39.119> up<00:01:39.960> to

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
40 degrees so maybe it's like up to

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.359 
40 degrees so maybe it's like up to
freezing<00:01:40.560> this<00:01:40.860> thing<00:01:41.040> will<00:01:41.159> be<00:01:41.250> good

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
freezing this thing will be good

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.550 
freezing this thing will be good
actually<00:01:41.939> I<00:01:42.540> won't<00:01:42.840> be<00:01:42.930> comfortable<00:01:43.380> but<00:01:43.439> I

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
actually I won't be comfortable but I

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.760 
actually I won't be comfortable but I
won't<00:01:43.740> die<00:01:44.119> alright<00:01:45.119> so<00:01:45.930> aside<00:01:46.200> from<00:01:46.259> so

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
won't die alright so aside from so

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.020 
won't die alright so aside from so
basically<00:01:47.100> is<00:01:47.189> what<00:01:47.220> you're<00:01:47.460> looking<00:01:47.490> for<00:01:47.880> the

basically is what you're looking for the

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.960 
basically is what you're looking for the
three<00:01:48.420> categories<00:01:48.990> so<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.619> want<00:01:49.829> to<00:01:49.920> do<00:01:50.070> look

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
three categories so you want to do look

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.580 
three categories so you want to do look
at<00:01:51.090> what<00:01:51.240> temperature<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:51.720> want<00:01:51.899> so<00:01:52.229> if

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
at what temperature you want so if

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.870 
at what temperature you want so if
you're<00:01:52.799> hiking<00:01:52.950> in<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.280> middle<00:01:53.520> of<00:01:53.610> summer

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
you're hiking in the middle of summer

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.330 
you're hiking in the middle of summer
you<00:01:54.270> know<00:01:54.390> in<00:01:54.659> Georgia<00:01:55.079> chances<00:01:56.070> are<00:01:56.189> you

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
you know in Georgia chances are you

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.280 
you know in Georgia chances are you
don't<00:01:56.430> need<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.700> get<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:56.850> 10<00:01:57.390> or<00:01:57.540> 15<00:01:57.840> degree<00:01:58.079> bag

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
don't need to get a 10 or 15 degree bag

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.080 
don't need to get a 10 or 15 degree bag
because<00:01:58.829> if<00:01:59.009> you<00:01:59.130> get<00:01:59.280> a<00:01:59.310> really<00:01:59.549> cold<00:01:59.880> bag

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
because if you get a really cold bag

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.880 
because if you get a really cold bag
like<00:02:00.329> 10<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.630> 15<00:02:00.869> degrees<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.320> it's<00:02:01.560> 50

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
like 10 and 15 degrees and it's 50

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.800 
like 10 and 15 degrees and it's 50
degrees<00:02:02.040> every<00:02:02.610> night<00:02:02.790> you're<00:02:03.540> going<00:02:03.659> to<00:02:03.719> be

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
degrees every night you're going to be

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.600 
degrees every night you're going to be
sweating<00:02:04.259> to<00:02:04.380> no<00:02:04.500> end<00:02:04.740> because<00:02:05.070> that<00:02:05.219> bag<00:02:05.430> is

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
sweating to no end because that bag is

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.649 
sweating to no end because that bag is
trying<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:05.880> keep<00:02:06.060> you<00:02:06.210> as<00:02:06.329> warm<00:02:06.509> as<00:02:06.630> possible

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
trying to keep you as warm as possible

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.430 
trying to keep you as warm as possible
but<00:02:07.170> it's<00:02:07.320> not<00:02:07.469> that<00:02:07.500> cold<00:02:08.129> outside<00:02:08.750> now<00:02:09.750> look

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
but it's not that cold outside now look

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.740 
but it's not that cold outside now look
at<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.619> other<00:02:10.770> side<00:02:11.039> if<00:02:11.250> you<00:02:11.730> have<00:02:11.970> you<00:02:12.569> know

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
at the other side if you have you know

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.900 
at the other side if you have you know
like<00:02:13.380> the<00:02:13.500> problem<00:02:13.800> I<00:02:13.860> had<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.250> two<00:02:14.520> problems

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
like the problem I had the two problems

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.260 
like the problem I had the two problems
I<00:02:15.000> had<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.600> one<00:02:16.200> time<00:02:16.440> I<00:02:16.470> went<00:02:16.680> out<00:02:16.860> I<00:02:17.100> had<00:02:17.700> a<00:02:17.730> 45

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
I had the one time I went out I had a 45

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.340 
I had the one time I went out I had a 45
degree<00:02:18.420> bag<00:02:18.810> and<00:02:19.110> it<00:02:19.650> got<00:02:19.770> down<00:02:19.860> to<00:02:19.920> 22<00:02:20.310> degrees

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
degree bag and it got down to 22 degrees

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.540 
degree bag and it got down to 22 degrees
definitely<00:02:22.350> passed<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:22.680> safety<00:02:23.070> rating<00:02:23.370> too

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
definitely passed the safety rating too

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.970 
definitely passed the safety rating too
so<00:02:23.880> you<00:02:24.510> know<00:02:24.630> 45<00:02:25.080> degree<00:02:25.320> bag<00:02:25.500> which<00:02:25.770> would<00:02:25.890> be

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
so you know 45 degree bag which would be

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.490 
so you know 45 degree bag which would be
like<00:02:26.100> a<00:02:26.130> nice<00:02:26.370> summer<00:02:26.640> day<00:02:26.910> and<00:02:27.720> it<00:02:28.050> was<00:02:28.080> 22

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
like a nice summer day and it was 22

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.380 
like a nice summer day and it was 22
degrees<00:02:28.800> which<00:02:29.040> means<00:02:29.250> it<00:02:29.490> was<00:02:29.610> useless<00:02:29.850> I<00:02:30.209> was

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
degrees which means it was useless I was

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.690 
degrees which means it was useless I was
just<00:02:30.540> freezing<00:02:31.200> cold<00:02:31.440> okay<00:02:32.190> so<00:02:32.250> if<00:02:32.459> you<00:02:32.550> get<00:02:32.640> a

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
just freezing cold okay so if you get a

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.120 
just freezing cold okay so if you get a
bag<00:02:32.910> that's<00:02:33.150> a<00:02:33.450> higher<00:02:34.230> temperature<00:02:34.620> rating

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
bag that's a higher temperature rating

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.010 
bag that's a higher temperature rating
and<00:02:35.310> it's<00:02:35.730> a<00:02:35.820> really<00:02:36.000> low<00:02:36.209> temperature<00:02:36.660> you're

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
and it's a really low temperature you're

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.900 
and it's a really low temperature you're
going<00:02:37.140> to<00:02:37.200> freeze<00:02:37.440> if<00:02:37.709> you<00:02:37.800> get<00:02:37.950> a<00:02:37.980> really<00:02:38.640> low

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
going to freeze if you get a really low

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.340 
going to freeze if you get a really low
temperature<00:02:39.420> bag<00:02:39.600> and<00:02:39.840> it's<00:02:39.959> really<00:02:40.110> warm

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
temperature bag and it's really warm

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.449 
temperature bag and it's really warm
outside<00:02:40.530> you're<00:02:40.950> going<00:02:41.070> to<00:02:41.130> sweat<00:02:41.310> to<00:02:41.430> death

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
outside you're going to sweat to death

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:42.830 
outside you're going to sweat to death
okay<00:02:41.880> so<00:02:41.940> you<00:02:42.120> want<00:02:42.300> to<00:02:42.360> make<00:02:42.390> sure<00:02:42.480> you<00:02:42.690> have

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
okay so you want to make sure you have

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.020 
okay so you want to make sure you have
the<00:02:42.930> right<00:02:42.959> temperature<00:02:43.620> for<00:02:43.830> what<00:02:44.430> kind<00:02:44.970> of

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
the right temperature for what kind of

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.690 
the right temperature for what kind of
climate<00:02:45.270> you're<00:02:45.480> going<00:02:45.600> to<00:02:45.660> be<00:02:45.750> out<00:02:45.780> in

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 
climate you're going to be out in

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.479 
climate you're going to be out in
alright<00:02:48.140> so<00:02:49.140> those<00:02:49.260> are<00:02:49.440> three<00:02:49.620> categories<00:02:49.830> as

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
alright so those are three categories as

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.030 
alright so those are three categories as
far<00:02:50.670> as<00:02:50.820> warm<00:02:51.060> follow<00:02:51.420> ah<00:02:51.630> ok<00:02:52.170> second<00:02:52.920> thing

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
far as warm follow ah ok second thing

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.949 
far as warm follow ah ok second thing
you<00:02:53.070> want<00:02:53.280> to<00:02:53.310> look<00:02:53.370> at<00:02:53.580> is<00:02:53.820> the<00:02:53.880> two<00:02:54.209> stuffing

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
you want to look at is the two stuffing

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.810 
you want to look at is the two stuffing
materials<00:02:55.410> that<00:02:55.830> the<00:02:56.160> bags<00:02:56.340> are<00:02:56.550> made<00:02:56.610> out<00:02:56.790> of

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
materials that the bags are made out of

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.790 
materials that the bags are made out of
you<00:02:57.330> have<00:02:57.480> down<00:02:57.780> and<00:02:58.140> you<00:02:58.290> have<00:02:58.410> synthetic

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
you have down and you have synthetic

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.850 
you have down and you have synthetic
alright<00:02:59.610> this<00:03:00.120> is<00:03:00.180> a<00:03:00.330> Down<00:03:00.600> bag<00:03:01.820> and<00:03:02.989> i<00:03:03.989> highly

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
alright this is a Down bag and i highly

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.440 
alright this is a Down bag and i highly
recommend<00:03:05.430> down<00:03:05.580> down<00:03:05.910> is<00:03:06.030> going<00:03:06.150> to<00:03:06.209> be<00:03:06.300> more

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
recommend down down is going to be more

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.470 
recommend down down is going to be more
expensive<00:03:06.510> than<00:03:07.080> synthetic<00:03:07.320> but<00:03:07.890> it<00:03:08.040> has

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
expensive than synthetic but it has

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.640 
expensive than synthetic but it has
quite<00:03:09.480> a<00:03:09.600> quite<00:03:10.110> a<00:03:10.170> number<00:03:10.350> of<00:03:10.470> advantages

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
quite a quite a number of advantages

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.940 
quite a quite a number of advantages
over<00:03:11.340> synthetic<00:03:11.780> down<00:03:12.780> which<00:03:13.470> is<00:03:13.500> just<00:03:13.770> what

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
over synthetic down which is just what

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.240 
over synthetic down which is just what
sites<00:03:14.310> down<00:03:14.459> feathers<00:03:15.620> it<00:03:16.620> packs<00:03:17.010> a<00:03:17.220> lot

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
sites down feathers it packs a lot

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.110 
sites down feathers it packs a lot
smaller<00:03:17.670> so<00:03:18.269> this<00:03:18.810> is<00:03:18.930> a<00:03:18.959> very<00:03:19.170> small<00:03:20.120> compared

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
smaller so this is a very small compared

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.580 
smaller so this is a very small compared
to<00:03:21.209> if<00:03:21.330> it<00:03:21.450> were<00:03:21.570> a<00:03:21.600> synthetic<00:03:22.170> it<00:03:22.350> would<00:03:22.500> be

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
to if it were a synthetic it would be

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.680 
to if it were a synthetic it would be
probably<00:03:22.860> about<00:03:23.100> this<00:03:23.370> big<00:03:23.430> okay<00:03:24.150> so<00:03:24.209> it<00:03:24.480> packs

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
probably about this big okay so it packs

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.890 
probably about this big okay so it packs
a<00:03:24.840> lot<00:03:24.870> lighter<00:03:25.170> it<00:03:26.130> can<00:03:26.400> as<00:03:26.940> far<00:03:27.239> as<00:03:27.330> warmth<00:03:27.660> to

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
a lot lighter it can as far as warmth to

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.900 
a lot lighter it can as far as warmth to
weight<00:03:27.930> ratio<00:03:28.590> it's<00:03:29.250> going<00:03:29.459> to<00:03:29.489> work<00:03:29.670> a<00:03:29.790> lot

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
weight ratio it's going to work a lot

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.610 
weight ratio it's going to work a lot
better<00:03:30.060> you<00:03:30.180> don't<00:03:30.420> need<00:03:30.630> as<00:03:30.750> much<00:03:30.780> down<00:03:31.230> to

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
better you don't need as much down to

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.020 
better you don't need as much down to
keep<00:03:31.799> the<00:03:31.920> same<00:03:32.130> kind<00:03:32.370> of<00:03:32.430> warmth<00:03:32.730> as<00:03:32.820> you<00:03:32.910> do

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
keep the same kind of warmth as you do

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.550 
keep the same kind of warmth as you do
with<00:03:33.150> synthetic<00:03:34.700> downs<00:03:35.700> the<00:03:36.150> downside<00:03:36.959> of<00:03:36.989> it

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
with synthetic downs the downside of it

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.390 
with synthetic downs the downside of it
is<00:03:37.709> it's<00:03:37.860> going<00:03:37.950> to<00:03:38.040> be<00:03:38.130> a<00:03:38.160> little<00:03:38.310> more

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
is it's going to be a little more

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.789 
is it's going to be a little more
expensive<00:03:38.760> but<00:03:39.000> I<00:03:39.450> think<00:03:39.720> it's<00:03:39.810> worth<00:03:39.870> it<00:03:40.200> okay

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
expensive but I think it's worth it okay

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:44.060 
expensive but I think it's worth it okay
after<00:03:41.180> using<00:03:42.180> a<00:03:42.329> 45<00:03:42.720> degree<00:03:42.840> bag<00:03:43.230> in<00:03:43.440> 22<00:03:43.799> degree

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
after using a 45 degree bag in 22 degree

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:45.830 
after using a 45 degree bag in 22 degree
weather<00:03:44.280> I'm<00:03:44.700> saying<00:03:45.120> you<00:03:45.420> know<00:03:45.450> what<00:03:45.540> I'm

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
weather I'm saying you know what I'm

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.630 
weather I'm saying you know what I'm
gonna<00:03:45.989> just<00:03:46.260> drop<00:03:46.440> some<00:03:46.739> coin<00:03:46.950> on<00:03:47.160> a<00:03:47.220> nice<00:03:47.370> bag

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
gonna just drop some coin on a nice bag

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.400 
gonna just drop some coin on a nice bag
but<00:03:48.299> what<00:03:48.480> this<00:03:48.570> one<00:03:48.750> I<00:03:48.780> actually<00:03:48.959> didn't<00:03:49.290> have

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
but what this one I actually didn't have

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:50.900 
but what this one I actually didn't have
to<00:03:49.590> okay<00:03:49.860> so<00:03:49.920> i<00:03:50.100> looked<00:03:50.640> at<00:03:50.730> what<00:03:50.850> the

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
to okay so i looked at what the

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.280 
to okay so i looked at what the
temperature<00:03:51.239> was<00:03:51.360> before<00:03:51.720> i<00:03:51.750> bought<00:03:51.930> this<00:03:52.079> one

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
temperature was before i bought this one

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.420 
temperature was before i bought this one
i<00:03:52.320> looked<00:03:52.530> at<00:03:52.620> what<00:03:52.709> the<00:03:52.799> average<00:03:52.950> temperature

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
i looked at what the average temperature

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.180 
i looked at what the average temperature
would<00:03:53.670> be<00:03:53.850> in<00:03:54.120> May<00:03:54.660> between<00:03:55.290> West<00:03:55.829> Virginia

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
would be in May between West Virginia

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.160 
would be in May between West Virginia
and<00:03:56.220> Connecticut<00:03:56.730> and<00:03:56.910> it<00:03:57.269> was<00:03:57.390> roughly<00:03:57.720> 40<00:03:58.079> to

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
and Connecticut and it was roughly 40 to

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.949 
and Connecticut and it was roughly 40 to
45<00:03:58.560> degrees<00:03:58.709> at<00:03:59.040> night<00:03:59.160> below<00:03:59.940> the<00:04:00.299> low<00:04:00.510> so<00:04:00.810> it

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
45 degrees at night below the low so it

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:01.970 
45 degrees at night below the low so it
might<00:04:01.110> not<00:04:01.140> have<00:04:01.350> been<00:04:01.380> there<00:04:01.650> but<00:04:01.769> it<00:04:01.890> was

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
might not have been there but it was

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.009 
might not have been there but it was
roughly<00:04:02.280> there<00:04:02.489> so<00:04:03.360> I<00:04:03.390> bought<00:04:03.570> a<00:04:03.600> 40<00:04:03.930> degree

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
roughly there so I bought a 40 degree

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:06.020 
roughly there so I bought a 40 degree
that's<00:04:04.350> the<00:04:04.470> kelty<00:04:04.769> Lightyear<00:04:05.160> sent<00:04:05.790> me<00:04:05.880> back

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
that's the kelty Lightyear sent me back

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.410 
that's the kelty Lightyear sent me back
like<00:04:06.269> 120<00:04:06.989> dollars<00:04:07.320> for<00:04:07.530> a<00:04:07.560> down<00:04:07.850> it's<00:04:08.850> 650

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
like 120 dollars for a down it's 650

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.020 
like 120 dollars for a down it's 650
down<00:04:09.600> that's<00:04:10.140> the<00:04:10.260> other<00:04:10.350> thing<00:04:10.640> down<00:04:11.640> has<00:04:12.000> a

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
down that's the other thing down has a

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:17.690 
down that's the other thing down has a
rating<00:04:12.510> system<00:04:14.360> it's<00:04:15.360> basically<00:04:16.190> the<00:04:17.190> type<00:04:17.669> of

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
rating system it's basically the type of

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.400 
rating system it's basically the type of
feather<00:04:18.090> that's<00:04:18.359> used<00:04:18.600> it's<00:04:18.840> like<00:04:19.019> the<00:04:19.200> size

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
feather that's used it's like the size

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.589 
feather that's used it's like the size
of<00:04:19.650> the<00:04:19.769> feather<00:04:20.010> i<00:04:20.100> believe<00:04:20.459> so<00:04:21.120> a<00:04:21.150> smaller

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:21.599 
of the feather i believe so a smaller

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:23.690 
of the feather i believe so a smaller
feather<00:04:21.900> is<00:04:22.080> going<00:04:22.229> to<00:04:22.289> be<00:04:22.470> nicer<00:04:23.280> because<00:04:23.460> you

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
feather is going to be nicer because you

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.070 
feather is going to be nicer because you
won't<00:04:23.849> have<00:04:23.940> to<00:04:24.030> use<00:04:24.060> as<00:04:24.360> many<00:04:24.479> it'll<00:04:24.780> keep<00:04:24.930> you

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
won't have to use as many it'll keep you

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.629 
won't have to use as many it'll keep you
warmer<00:04:25.410> I<00:04:25.530> believe<00:04:25.800> that's<00:04:25.919> right

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 
warmer I believe that's right

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:29.179 
warmer I believe that's right
but<00:04:27.479> either<00:04:27.599> way<00:04:27.900> it's<00:04:28.259> that<00:04:28.680> higher<00:04:28.949> the

00:04:29.179 --> 00:04:29.189 
but either way it's that higher the

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:30.890 
but either way it's that higher the
number<00:04:29.340> of<00:04:29.580> the<00:04:29.699> down<00:04:29.909> the<00:04:30.509> better<00:04:30.719> the

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 
number of the down the better the

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.570 
number of the down the better the
quality<00:04:30.930> which<00:04:31.530> means<00:04:31.710> it's<00:04:31.860> more<00:04:32.069> warmth<00:04:32.400> to

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
quality which means it's more warmth to

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.969 
quality which means it's more warmth to
weight<00:04:32.689> ratio<00:04:33.689> there's<00:04:34.169> a<00:04:34.229> higher<00:04:34.469> warmth<00:04:34.800> to

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:34.979 
weight ratio there's a higher warmth to

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:37.399 
weight ratio there's a higher warmth to
weight<00:04:35.009> ratio<00:04:35.629> what<00:04:36.629> I've<00:04:36.749> heard<00:04:36.990> and<00:04:37.199> what

00:04:37.399 --> 00:04:37.409 
weight ratio what I've heard and what

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:39.080 
weight ratio what I've heard and what
I've<00:04:37.499> gone<00:04:37.680> with<00:04:37.889> is<00:04:38.039> I<00:04:38.249> will<00:04:38.400> not<00:04:38.550> use<00:04:38.580> down

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
I've gone with is I will not use down

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.899 
I've gone with is I will not use down
that<00:04:39.389> is<00:04:39.539> under<00:04:39.840> a<00:04:39.870> 650<00:04:40.469> rating<00:04:40.860> so<00:04:41.610> you'll

00:04:41.899 --> 00:04:41.909 
that is under a 650 rating so you'll

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:46.279 
that is under a 650 rating so you'll
usually<00:04:42.180> see<00:04:42.590> 650<00:04:43.590> 700<00:04:44.249> 750<00:04:44.789> 8<00:04:45.060> 850<00:04:45.629> and<00:04:45.779> 900<00:04:46.229> I

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:46.289 
usually see 650 700 750 8 850 and 900 I

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:48.830 
usually see 650 700 750 8 850 and 900 I
believe<00:04:46.529> is<00:04:46.650> the<00:04:46.740> top<00:04:47.150> very<00:04:48.150> rarely<00:04:48.509> do<00:04:48.749> you

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
believe is the top very rarely do you

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.749 
believe is the top very rarely do you
see<00:04:48.870> 900<00:04:49.409> but<00:04:49.499> it's<00:04:49.620> there<00:04:51.259> so<00:04:52.259> this<00:04:53.159> is<00:04:53.189> a<00:04:53.310> 650

a little bit more ways more okay so make

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:24.950 
a little bit more ways more okay so make
