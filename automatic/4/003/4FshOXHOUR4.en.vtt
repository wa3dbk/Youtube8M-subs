00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
where I just already put short pieces of

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.430 
where I just already put short pieces of
molding<00:02:06.420> up<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.560> cover<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.129> plywood<00:02:09.060> edge<00:02:09.440> and

molding up to cover the plywood edge and

molding up to cover the plywood edge and
I<00:02:11.400> just<00:02:12.060> decided<00:02:12.480> to

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
I just decided to

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.980 
I just decided to
use<00:02:13.560> this<00:02:13.800> as<00:02:14.070> my<00:02:14.610> corner<00:02:15.600> block<00:02:17.720> almost<00:02:18.720> any

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
use this as my corner block almost any

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:25.670 
use this as my corner block almost any
scrap<00:02:20.510> can<00:02:21.510> be<00:02:21.960> turned<00:02:22.230> into<00:02:22.500> a<00:02:23.390> nice<00:02:24.680> corner

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
scrap can be turned into a nice corner

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.070 
scrap can be turned into a nice corner
block<00:02:25.950> could<00:02:26.610> have<00:02:26.790> already<00:02:27.060> just<00:02:27.750> a<00:02:27.900> right

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
block could have already just a right

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.720 
block could have already just a right
rabbit<00:02:28.410> on<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.130> right

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
rabbit on the right

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:37.310 
rabbit on the right
sweep<00:02:30.600> curve<00:02:32.390> color<00:02:34.760> that<00:02:35.760> will<00:02:36.060> get<00:02:36.960> just

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
sweep curve color that will get just

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.280 
sweep curve color that will get just
enough<00:02:37.710> contrast<00:02:38.340> or<00:02:38.790> fits<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:40.020> piece<00:02:40.260> just

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
enough contrast or fits the piece just

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.920 
enough contrast or fits the piece just
so<00:02:42.710> in<00:02:43.710> general<00:02:43.980> I<00:02:44.370> think<00:02:44.430> that<00:02:44.880> it<00:02:45.210> works<00:02:45.720> out

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
so in general I think that it works out

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.180 
so in general I think that it works out
best<00:02:46.290> to<00:02:46.680> have<00:02:46.920> the<00:02:47.430> blocks<00:02:47.730> being<00:02:49.190> thicker

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
best to have the blocks being thicker

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.450 
best to have the blocks being thicker
than<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.750> run<00:02:51.990> of<00:02:52.170> the<00:02:52.320> molding<00:02:52.770> leading<00:02:53.310> up

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
than the run of the molding leading up

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:58.240 
than the run of the molding leading up
to<00:02:53.490> the<00:02:53.760> block<00:02:55.880> because<00:02:56.880> it<00:02:57.180> creates<00:02:57.570> more

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
to the block because it creates more

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:06.680 
to the block because it creates more
dimensionality<00:02:59.250> and<00:02:59.580> a<00:02:59.960> shadow<00:03:00.960> line<00:03:05.690> obvious

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
dimensionality and a shadow line obvious

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.710 
dimensionality and a shadow line obvious
differences<00:03:07.320> in<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:07.830> shape<00:03:09.260> width<00:03:10.260> and

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
differences in the shape width and

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.970 
differences in the shape width and
thickness<00:03:12.720> of<00:03:13.170> the<00:03:13.440> molding<00:03:15.560> can<00:03:16.560> work<00:03:16.770> as

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
thickness of the molding can work as

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:23.630 
thickness of the molding can work as
decorative<00:03:17.910> advantage<00:03:21.920> and<00:03:22.920> it<00:03:23.160> gives<00:03:23.400> the

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
decorative advantage and it gives the

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.550 
decorative advantage and it gives the
chance<00:03:23.880> to<00:03:24.209> use<00:03:24.420> shorter<00:03:24.870> pieces<00:03:25.110> that

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
chance to use shorter pieces that

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.530 
chance to use shorter pieces that
wouldn't<00:03:25.890> be<00:03:26.040> long<00:03:26.520> enough<00:03:26.820> to<00:03:26.880> reach<00:03:27.150> from
