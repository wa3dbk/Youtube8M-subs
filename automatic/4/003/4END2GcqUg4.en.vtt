00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:12.879
 now when you come from disadvantaged families I take active bouchard 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:15.879
 and dynamic and balanced we would have thought one day power 

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:20.439
 for a week the four Alsatian teenagers tasted 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:25.059
 joys of paragliding a huge gift from three college students 

00:00:25.059 --> 00:00:30.070
 specialized antena passes physical activity adapted it health 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.350
 in clear their training associates the sport so handicap 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.590
 the week should resume that their graduation work that we 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.740
 seemed rather an impressive project and% 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.860
 and then a year 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.240
 the attraction of the new because the one where we knew no one 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.240
 knew paragliding suddenly we said why not and then 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:52.150
 it's true that it's a bit fun anyway disappointment on the other hand the 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.390
 good rating obtained by the project 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.590
 a pride obviously for m 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.840
 between fundraising for accommodation 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.949
 accompanying children several weeks have elapsed 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:04.500
 but the most important 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.710
 he is not there 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.840
 at first when I was offered it I thought it was a great idea 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.230
 but then I started to be scared 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.010
 it feels like a bird 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:18.010
 it was great to see things from the chaos 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.400
 it was so good it was great 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.400
 I loved the feeling of the wind and flying like a bird 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.600
 it was good but once that's enough 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.560
 to supervise deaf and dumb not easy for the producers of the school 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.180
 which was the first sign language of rigor a 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.040
 translator to stay on the spot women 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.040
 the couple to take orders 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.750
 usually we do not consume and radios 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.150
 from there up made so we noted a small structure of free radios if you 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.850
 read 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.120
 she plays a tight part over the mans this decision made to give I 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.769
 would say the direction learn 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.489
 that is to say every night right or left 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:20.189
 and then a lot with these visuals also with snowshoes or 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:21.439
 functional snowshoes 

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:24.499
 on the visual since my stay in fact I will rely on him and she 

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:28.089
 and then very sure the sensation 

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:33.659
 paragliding hang gliding or parachutist hang up in May 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:38.089
 while a country is possible in Alsace a dozen sailing clubs 

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.909
 offers 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:39.510
 it's an instruction
