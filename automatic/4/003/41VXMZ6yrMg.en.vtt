00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
my thoughts and stuff about why riding

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.840 
my thoughts and stuff about why riding
is<00:02:39.740> awesome<00:02:40.040> but<00:02:40.160> sometimes<00:02:40.460> I<00:02:40.550> wonder<00:02:40.820> if

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
is awesome but sometimes I wonder if

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.440 
is awesome but sometimes I wonder if
that<00:02:40.910> doesn't<00:02:41.510> take<00:02:41.690> away<00:02:41.720> from<00:02:42.820> what<00:02:43.820> I<00:02:43.850> the

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
that doesn't take away from what I the

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:45.910 
that doesn't take away from what I the
intent<00:02:44.780> of<00:02:44.900> trying<00:02:45.200> to<00:02:45.260> express<00:02:45.620> what<00:02:45.800> it's

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
intent of trying to express what it's

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.710 
intent of trying to express what it's
like<00:02:46.130> on<00:02:46.430> two<00:02:46.670> wheels<00:02:46.850> which<00:02:47.480> is<00:02:47.600> why

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
like on two wheels which is why

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.060 
like on two wheels which is why
sometimes<00:02:47.930> I<00:02:48.110> think<00:02:48.170> I'm<00:02:48.410> just<00:02:48.440> posting<00:02:48.980> a

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
sometimes I think I'm just posting a

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.850 
sometimes I think I'm just posting a
ride<00:02:49.360> I'm<00:02:50.360> not<00:02:50.540> talking<00:02:50.900> I'm<00:02:50.990> just<00:02:51.230> riding<00:02:51.470> and

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
ride I'm not talking I'm just riding and

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.440 
ride I'm not talking I'm just riding and
just<00:02:52.040> a<00:02:52.130> this<00:02:52.370> is<00:02:52.490> what<00:02:52.640> a<00:02:52.670> normal<00:02:53.000> ride<00:02:53.180> is

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
just a this is what a normal ride is

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.320 
just a this is what a normal ride is
like<00:02:53.690> on<00:02:54.560> a<00:02:54.620> motorcycle<00:02:55.250> and<00:02:55.370> but<00:02:55.880> a<00:02:56.060> lot<00:02:56.300> of

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
like on a motorcycle and but a lot of

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.000 
like on a motorcycle and but a lot of
that<00:02:56.450> may<00:02:56.660> seem<00:02:56.960> boring<00:02:57.260> especially<00:02:57.710> if

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
that may seem boring especially if

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.430 
that may seem boring especially if
you've<00:02:58.130> yourself<00:02:58.520> ride<00:02:58.990> but<00:02:59.990> if<00:03:00.110> you<00:03:00.200> don't

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
you've yourself ride but if you don't

you've yourself ride but if you don't
ride<00:03:00.680> it<00:03:00.980> wouldn't<00:03:01.280> be<00:03:01.370> boring<00:03:01.550> well<00:03:02.030> it

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
ride it wouldn't be boring well it

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.700 
ride it wouldn't be boring well it
probably<00:03:02.420> would<00:03:02.510> because<00:03:02.960> it's<00:03:03.110> not<00:03:03.260> and<00:03:03.590> it

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:03.710 
probably would because it's not and it

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.460 
probably would because it's not and it
isn't<00:03:03.980> always<00:03:04.160> exciting<00:03:04.850> and<00:03:05.210> that's<00:03:06.200> one<00:03:06.380> of
