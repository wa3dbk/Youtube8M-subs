00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.380 
is just out playing Joe Johnson and
really<00:01:35.040> it's<00:01:35.159> all<00:01:35.340> left<00:01:35.579> up<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.880> Paul<00:01:36.090> Pierce

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
really it's all left up to Paul Pierce

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.670 
really it's all left up to Paul Pierce
right<00:01:36.570> now<00:01:36.720> for<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:36.960> Brooklyn<00:01:37.229> Nets<00:01:37.350> as<00:01:37.560> he

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
right now for the Brooklyn Nets as he

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.469 
right now for the Brooklyn Nets as he
was<00:01:37.799> really<00:01:38.009> only<00:01:38.130> one<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.490> get<00:01:38.640> off<00:01:38.790> in<00:01:39.000> Game

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
was really only one to get off in Game

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.940 
was really only one to get off in Game
four<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:40.020> I<00:01:40.110> don't<00:01:40.290> think<00:01:40.470> anything's<00:01:40.799> going

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
four and I don't think anything's going

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.230 
four and I don't think anything's going
to<00:01:41.040> improve<00:01:41.310> here<00:01:41.520> in<00:01:41.610> this<00:01:41.759> game<00:01:42.000> five

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
to improve here in this game five

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.670 
to improve here in this game five
because<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.630> Raptors<00:01:42.960> really<00:01:43.320> have<00:01:43.500> found

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
because the Raptors really have found

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.620 
because the Raptors really have found
their<00:01:43.920> defense<00:01:44.340> especially<00:01:44.850> in<00:01:45.240> game<00:01:45.479> number

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
their defense especially in game number

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:46.760 
their defense especially in game number
four<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.049> I<00:01:46.110> think<00:01:46.259> they<00:01:46.320> can<00:01:46.500> carry<00:01:46.649> that

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
four and I think they can carry that

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.980 
four and I think they can carry that
over<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.189> carry<00:01:47.399> that<00:01:47.549> momentum<00:01:47.700> over<00:01:48.420> into

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
over and carry that momentum over into

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.690 
over and carry that momentum over into
game<00:01:49.200> number<00:01:49.229> five<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.220> think<00:01:50.430> they<00:01:50.520> can

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
game number five and I think they can

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.639 
game number five and I think they can
get<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.939> cover<00:01:51.180> here<00:01:51.390> at<00:01:51.540> minus<00:01:51.990> three<00:01:52.259> so<00:01:52.439> add

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
get the cover here at minus three so add

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.069 
get the cover here at minus three so add
