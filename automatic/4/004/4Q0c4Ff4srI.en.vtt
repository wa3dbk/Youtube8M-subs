you can see you can actually change this

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.399 
you can see you can actually change this
to<00:01:08.640> know<00:01:09.450> all<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.720> different<00:01:09.840> types<00:01:10.260> of

to go ahead and turn that on you've got
a<00:01:17.100> really<00:01:17.280> nice<00:01:17.460> feature<00:01:17.759> as<00:01:17.939> well<00:01:17.970> if<00:01:18.840> we<00:01:18.990> zoom

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
a really nice feature as well if we zoom

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.710 
a really nice feature as well if we zoom
in<00:01:19.500> here<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:20.100> when<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:20.970> actually<00:01:21.090> tap<00:01:21.509> on

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
in here and when you actually tap on

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.020 
in here and when you actually tap on
something<00:01:22.200> it<00:01:22.320> tells<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.740> what<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.759> actual

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
something it tells you what the actual

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.370 
something it tells you what the actual
place<00:01:24.450> is<00:01:24.750> so<00:01:26.330> if<00:01:27.330> we<00:01:27.570> actually<00:01:27.689> could<00:01:28.229> see

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
place is so if we actually could see

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.170 
place is so if we actually could see
I've<00:01:28.500> done<00:01:28.650> that<00:01:28.770> on<00:01:28.829> here<00:01:29.100> if<00:01:29.189> you<00:01:29.369> do<00:01:30.030> some

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
I've done that on here if you do some

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.300 
I've done that on here if you do some
different<00:01:30.450> places<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.140> when<00:01:31.920> you<00:01:32.009> just<00:01:32.130> tap

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
different places and when you just tap

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.980 
different places and when you just tap
on<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.549> map<00:01:32.670> it<00:01:32.820> just<00:01:33.030> tells<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.869> actual

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
on the map it just tells you the actual

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.990 
on the map it just tells you the actual
place<00:01:34.320> that's<00:01:34.650> pretty<00:01:34.950> good<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.729> but<00:01:35.909> yeah

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
place that's pretty good and but yeah

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.940 
place that's pretty good and but yeah
