the bacon we're fine mesh sieve so the

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.490 
the bacon we're fine mesh sieve so the
bacon<00:02:54.459> fat<00:02:54.640> drops<00:02:55.330> right<00:02:55.540> into<00:02:55.750> the<00:02:55.930> Bourbon

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
in the jar and just let it sit there on

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.670 
in the jar and just let it sit there on
the<00:03:05.290> countertop<00:03:05.800> for<00:03:06.550> about<00:03:06.760> six<00:03:07.060> hours

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
the countertop for about six hours

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.949 
the countertop for about six hours
strain<00:03:08.680> it<00:03:08.950> or<00:03:09.100> shaking<00:03:09.880> it<00:03:10.000> whenever<00:03:10.810> you

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
strain it or shaking it whenever you

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:14.460 
strain it or shaking it whenever you
happen<00:03:11.290> to<00:03:11.320> walk<00:03:11.500> by<00:03:13.080> the<00:03:14.080> fat<00:03:14.260> will

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
happen to walk by the fat will

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.199 
happen to walk by the fat will
eventually<00:03:14.860> solidify<00:03:15.400> on<00:03:15.640> the<00:03:15.760> top<00:03:15.940> a<00:03:15.970> little

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
eventually solidify on the top a little

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:19.199 
eventually solidify on the top a little
bit<00:03:16.330> like<00:03:16.540> that<00:03:17.100> but<00:03:18.100> we<00:03:18.220> wanted<00:03:18.459> very<00:03:18.519> solid

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
bit like that but we wanted very solid

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.870 
bit like that but we wanted very solid
so<00:03:19.510> after<00:03:20.380> the<00:03:20.470> six<00:03:20.680> hours<00:03:20.980> we're<00:03:21.250> gonna<00:03:21.340> place

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
so after the six hours we're gonna place

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.080 
so after the six hours we're gonna place
the<00:03:22.060> mixture<00:03:22.239> into<00:03:23.140> the<00:03:23.260> freezer<00:03:23.880> for<00:03:24.880> an<00:03:25.000> hour

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
the mixture into the freezer for an hour

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.310 
the mixture into the freezer for an hour
or<00:03:25.330> so<00:03:25.600> just<00:03:25.900> to<00:03:26.440> better<00:03:26.650> solidify<00:03:27.340> the<00:03:27.400> fat

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
or so just to better solidify the fat

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.979 
or so just to better solidify the fat
after<00:03:29.320> the<00:03:29.410> fats<00:03:29.880> nice<00:03:30.880> and<00:03:31.269> solid<00:03:31.720> we're
