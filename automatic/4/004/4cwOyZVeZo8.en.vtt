yourself
Deerling<00:02:57.879> I<00:02:58.150> guess<00:02:58.930> the<00:02:59.110> shield<00:02:59.349> was<00:02:59.500> just<00:02:59.709> has

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
Deerling I guess the shield was just has

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.030 
Deerling I guess the shield was just has
really<00:03:00.489> had<00:03:00.819> for<00:03:01.810> us<00:03:02.049> this<00:03:02.470> six<00:03:02.799> of<00:03:02.950> us

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040
