00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:08.399
 species 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.860
 hello kirby nautas welcome to the canal 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:18.220
 of varnish and here we are in our guide 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:20.820
 of kirby and the rainbow brush and we're going to 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:25.390
 continue where we left off 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:29.560
 starting level 3 and we played the 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:32.379
 Indian indigo ocean color come on let's go 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.570
 give level 3 to see what surprises we 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:37.239
 wait for the moment 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:40.050
 kirby adrift we need to get 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:44.559
 Daily if there is luck in roulette 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.629
 gold medal and 25 chests go there 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:48.640
 we started our collection of 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:51.730
 little stars to get that 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.070
 gold medal there we are crashing against 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:58.300
 the total school of fish a star 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:00.760
 little girl and now pipe down that we 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.550
 will wait at the end of the pipeline 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.640
 water and we have the qirbi with glasses 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:09.450
 dive we have our kirby diver 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.490
 in search of the stars 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.329
 there we are, we have already taken those 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:18.299
 we went through the tube on the right that 

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:21.899
 takes us to this new area there we have 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:24.710
 another little star plus three others in this 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:27.110
 exit towards the tube 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.270
 well the pipes take us from one side 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.640
 to another at impressive speeds 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:35.630
 the fish until they wear glasses 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.400
 dive come more stars in the something 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.190
 of death has to get all 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.869
 the strict possible there are the little fish 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.979
 in these they give us one more star 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:48.800
 big there all all all in one 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:53.509
 Rainbow brush charger by calling it 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:56.030
 somehow come up we went up here to 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:58.490
 see come to the qirbi ay me that leaves the 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:02.030
 starlets now I will go for them come 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:04.580
 to the down perfect qirbi and the 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.740
 we have collected and now we have a 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.810
 small circle with lots of 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.320
 rockers that are letting go 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.930
 little star and kirby do not upload here we have 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.370
 the water currents that are going 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:21.450
 pushing back and forth 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:23.069
 come 4 starlets perfect good are you 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.900
 more than stars are stars because 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.690
 they are bigger and there we have the first 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:31.170
 chest we need to use the impulse there 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:34.260
 is to break the barrier first coffer 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.180
 picked up and let the current we 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:40.230
 carry forward good kirby that your 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:44.040
 Once there it is come and that yes you have to go 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.959
 tracing the route so that I want and come 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.360
 to take it, take it there is perfect and 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:51.060
 go catching those stars for the 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.980
 very important way is very important 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.810
 because otherwise we will not get to the medal 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.530
 of gold 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:01.290
 first we go down here and then 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.970
 out not but seeing once more bitten 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.849
 I do not know if to run but has given a 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.280
 hit served down there we have a 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:11.580
 life hidden among the corals of 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:16.680
 plasticine and now if we break those 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:19.860
 cubes we take you are stars and 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.980
 we eliminated before there is out the fishing 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:25.620
 the gaffitas to dive stars by 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.470
 here little stars out and the current 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:30.569
 it's very is very strong and we have to 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.150
 use another impulse here to be able 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:35.370
 get to that chest because the current 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.370
 is very strong and if it does not leave us 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.750
 key punctured around the important thing 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.690
 is that I have taken the chest already 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:45.810
 managed to recover me come star 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.970
 come in and you're perfect and a life there 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.690
 down that they give us by having picked it up 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:54.670
 all 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:56.890
 you have to break these cubes and good kirby 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.570
 you're a bit rebellious under water is 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:02.200
 difficult to control the qirbi here 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:03.940
 below and we went through the next door 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.620
 phase 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.230
 well there we have a tomatito that we 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:11.920
 will recover life to the maximum we go there 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:15.610
 perfect and we entered through this door that 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:17.830
 it's a temporary challenge we have the chest there 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.560
 that goes down in the marine current 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:23.530
 so come correct right there we are 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.590
 this simple challenge this challenge 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:30.100
 simple but you also have to try 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:33.280
 do not collide with the outgoing come 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.810
 let's hit the rocker and down here 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.030
 we have a lot of little stars 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.390
 waiting for us ready for the herald 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.400
 of death pick it up 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:44.970
 already collected we can all 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:47.820
 continue ascending through the water 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:50.880
 yes surrounding skewers for 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:53.430
 do not pinch us and picking up as not 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:56.430
 little stars and there we have the following 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:05:00.120
 We go there to inhabit the path 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:04.460
 perfect is the room we pick up there 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:07.860
 rocker and rainbow loader let's go 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:11.700
 come you have to go dodging these 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:13.650
 It does not work and you do not throw Kiril and has 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:16.320
 excited and he has thrown himself against the 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:20.009
 spikes and let's pick up that life that 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:23.050
 we have great there 

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:26.120
 we continue towards the current that we 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:28.880
 leads to the next area 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:31.940
 and here we are going to find it 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:34.100
 quite strong current and the same as 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:37.729
 we had done before we have to guide 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:40.250
 kirby with our rainbow line you have to 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:45.370
 he's gone so he can pick up everything 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:48.040
 what you catch on the way there is fine 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:51.490
 come on rainbow star stars 

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:53.500
 and little bottle more stars a life we 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:55.630
 caught the good life is equal 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:58.389
 rainbow starlets starlets to more 

00:05:55.630 --> 00:06:00.729
 that the rockers and we come to this 

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:03.729
 room where there is a star that 

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:05.350
 take it, take it, we get a lot or a 

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:08.110
 bunch of important stars this is 

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:10.960
 to be able to reach the gold medal and 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:12.669
 a life runs served eyes these 

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:16.300
 such strong currents are a bit 

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:19.120
 annoying come on we go there so yes 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:22.889
 perfect and now you have to break those 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:25.479
 blocks to get it right we're going 

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:27.130
 climbing star rockers 

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:29.680
 great 

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:31.750
 in the end we will need an impulse to 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:34.240
 collect the last chest that we are already 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:37.539
 here a little bit to get there we have it 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:40.120
 at right hands come impulse kirby and 

00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:41.650
 ready truth or not down there or that 

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:44.620
 I was going to Kirby everywhere 

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:46.030
 less where did he have to go then 

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:47.560
 well we have already collected the fifth and 

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:49.750
 last chest 

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:51.760
 let's now take advantage of that I have another 

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:55.300
 even more so to use it for 

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:58.570
 break and collect things we go there still 

00:06:55.300 --> 00:07:01.360
 I have another one but you do not let 

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:04.660
 I go slowly to go collecting little stars 

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:08.130
 well and the diary to see if I can do it 

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:11.320
 with the diary and now yes very good 

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:13.590
 completed everything in full worth the 

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:17.080
 complete redundancy 

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:21.190
 little stars that we get reach us 

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:24.070
 perfect gold medal and 25 chests 

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:28.540
 let's go opening the first one 

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:32.460
 figurine another figurine plus a theme 

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:37.259
 musical figurine 

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:40.680
 and music theme well I will not throw a 

00:07:37.259 --> 00:07:43.650
 look at the newspaper because I still have left 

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:47.220
 pending to pick up some diaries 

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:50.130
 of level 2 then for the next 

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:53.340
 I will teach it she will have picked them up and 

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:56.400
 I will teach them but also when 

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:58.860
 finish with data so history 

00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:00.479
 I will do a compilation video teaching 

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:02.160
 all the fragments of the newspaper and then 

00:08:00.479 --> 00:08:04.830
 another with all the figurines for 

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:06.360
 you can see them all there carefully and 

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:08.490
 all together 

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:11.280
 Well here has come this 

00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:13.440
 phase 31 as always I hope that I have 

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:16.199
 liked that you can be useful and we 

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:18.380
 we see in upcoming videos so up 

00:08:16.199 --> 00:08:18.380
 then
