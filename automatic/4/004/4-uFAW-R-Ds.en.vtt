00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
going to say this is fake but well if

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.350 
going to say this is fake but well if
you<00:00:37.770> do<00:00:37.980> then<00:00:38.219> that's<00:00:38.460> up<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.850> you<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.000> decide

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
you do then that's up to you to decide

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.720 
you do then that's up to you to decide
but<00:00:39.870> is<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:40.860> committing<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.430> pre-release

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
but is it committing the pre-release

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.200 
but is it committing the pre-release
before<00:00:42.329> villages<00:00:42.719> were<00:00:42.809> properly<00:00:43.200> done<00:00:43.410> so<00:00:43.860> i

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
before villages were properly done so i

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.080 
before villages were properly done so i
guess<00:00:45.210> it<00:00:45.329> was<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.480> glitch<00:00:45.629> for<00:00:45.870> this<00:00:46.079> big<00:00:46.530> but

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:47.090

water<00:01:13.229> streaming<00:01:13.729> but<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:14.820> is<00:01:14.939> actually

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
water streaming but it is actually

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.399 
water streaming but it is actually
pretty<00:01:15.390> cool<00:01:15.570> if<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:15.780> wanted<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.170> create<00:01:16.380> a

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
very glitchy like I said if you could

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.859 
very glitchy like I said if you could
create<00:01:57.490> a<00:01:57.579> survivor<00:01:57.880> world<00:01:58.149> and<00:01:58.420> build<00:01:58.659> this

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
create a survivor world and build this

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:02.160 
create a survivor world and build this
back<00:01:59.170> it<00:02:00.100> would<00:02:00.340> be<00:02:00.460> amazing<00:02:00.880> I<00:02:01.360> would<00:02:02.049> never

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
back it would be amazing I would never

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.419 
back it would be amazing I would never
be<00:02:02.350> able<00:02:02.409> to<00:02:02.500> do<00:02:02.619> it<00:02:02.649> because<00:02:02.979> there's<00:02:03.159> so<00:02:03.310> much

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:03.429 
be able to do it because there's so much

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:06.270 
be able to do it because there's so much
stuff<00:02:03.579> just<00:02:03.939> like<00:02:04.060> this<00:02:04.890> with<00:02:05.890> like<00:02:06.069> different

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
stuff just like this with like different

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.279 
stuff just like this with like different
kinds<00:02:06.850> of<00:02:06.939> buildings<00:02:07.060> built<00:02:07.509> together<00:02:07.659> on<00:02:08.080> top

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289
