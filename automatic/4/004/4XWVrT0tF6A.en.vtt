00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:04.770
 yes that was the last one for him 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.240
 possibly assume we have 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.170
 Wednesday there is no last one 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.080
 home game 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.519
 glad if everything goes as by 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.009
 then it was probably the 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.599
 last match you were the one 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.870
 goodbye the way you suburb it 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.870
 beforehand 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.160
 yes mostly 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:26.040
 when you see how we need the first one 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.810
 half of course started early 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:32.160
 lead after that on a 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:34.470
 unfortunate way in a one and yes 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.810
 after that, we continued to believe in it 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.070
 and keep playing 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.260
 and if you have such a second half on the 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.790
 mat then she deserves that you win 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.680
 things are a longer late to even more 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.040
 make costs then of course one 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.600
 great day for ibrahim afellay 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.420
 when you possibly go to the not so go 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.070
 Yes if we assume it was 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.350
 the farewell match 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.080
 yes we did that fit everything 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.920
 and the only blink on this afternoon is 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:04.259
 of course that we are younger than traveling 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.470
 does not look very positive 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:09.869
 do you have any idea how to agree with him 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.320
 well you were in a lot of pain and so off 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.970
 to wait 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.590
 the first diagnosis yes 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.899
 is new not not paint as positive 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.960
 I was of course short of one 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:25.860
 her screamed in pain and 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.200
 yes I was not comfortable to wash 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.450
 to see that knee and whatever i like it 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.920
 understood from the doctors is the first 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.410
 diagnosis that it is not good for him 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.240
 looks like and that is a big with 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.450
 this afternoon the team was briefly off 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.310
 certainly started well after that time but equally 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.580
 we got touched on a little bit 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.560
 report to the will to equalizing 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.910
 were giving back to search 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.009
 Ctac was of course not too hard either 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:51.690
 easy to make like you without 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.910
 hot mistake in you must have hot in 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.410
 the mistake is in it but I think we are 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.440
 our DNA 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.959
 think very well we have repackaged and 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.580
 finally finally about whole game 

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:03.509
 can you do that again in the top 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.369
 have been parties 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.480
 of course it is not nice if someone 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:11.080
 mountain are injured or 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:15.220
 he becomes focus on you playing 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:17.140
 and yes it was a bit cold but I did 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.210
 just a moment will be fine 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.470
 and finally you make another one 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.690
 major hit 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.800
 you have to feel that way too 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.450
 be pleasant 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.110
 yes of course it is too good to score 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:31.210
 to our important goals yes if you 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.720
 sec through for Wickham to score points 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:36.220
 2000 you go but think was nice and beautiful 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.800
 for the trusting score 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.600
 Hercules try it just does yes 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.820
 from street language and one time it works 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.110
 the other time it works a little less than 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.470
 Today it is important to him 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.630
 nasas so but they do not bother you further 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.030
 whether it is a role or an assist 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.410
 to feel feel to have no that should 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.240
 not so much out i think if you 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.850
 are important for a product that 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.920
 good feeling so whether you are ts or gives 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.580
 makes a goal or genesis gives it 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.560
 the more 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.460
 the most beautiful moment was the 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.840
 supporters campaign yes that I really thought 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.120
 I had a hard time honestly 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.470
 said it really was a very nice one 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.960
 tribute 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.890
 And then I want all supporters too 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.520
 thank you for it because it was 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.520
 really fantastic
