what's going on guys this is empty box

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:04.460 
what's going on guys this is empty box
and<00:00:03.060> today<00:00:03.449> we're<00:00:03.720> going<00:00:03.810> to<00:00:03.899> finally<00:00:04.319> get

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
and today we're going to finally get

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.470 
and today we're going to finally get
into<00:00:04.680> the<00:00:04.830> driving<00:00:05.310> aspect<00:00:05.490> of<00:00:05.940> the<00:00:06.060> series

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
into the driving aspect of the series

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.360 
into the driving aspect of the series
but<00:00:07.170> we're<00:00:07.319> going<00:00:07.440> to<00:00:07.500> start<00:00:07.770> with<00:00:07.890> something

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
but we're going to start with something

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.430 
but we're going to start with something
that<00:00:08.519> is<00:00:08.760> completely<00:00:08.929> overlooked<00:00:09.929> way<00:00:10.380> too

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
that is completely overlooked way too

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.890 
that is completely overlooked way too
much<00:00:11.070> in<00:00:11.460> the<00:00:11.700> sim<00:00:11.910> racing<00:00:12.090> community<00:00:12.360> and

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
much in the sim racing community and

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.360 
much in the sim racing community and
this<00:00:13.349> is<00:00:13.500> actually<00:00:13.830> one<00:00:14.009> of<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.160> most

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
this is actually one of the most

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.099 
this is actually one of the most
important<00:00:14.910> things<00:00:15.210> you<00:00:15.299> can<00:00:15.389> do<00:00:15.690> this<00:00:15.960> is

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
important things you can do this is

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.410 
important things you can do this is
something<00:00:16.260> that<00:00:16.470> will<00:00:17.039> make<00:00:17.070> you<00:00:17.460> faster<00:00:18.029> it

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
something that will make you faster it

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.630 
something that will make you faster it
will<00:00:18.779> make<00:00:18.990> you<00:00:19.109> more<00:00:19.140> consistent<00:00:19.650> regardless

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
will make you more consistent regardless

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.689 
will make you more consistent regardless
if<00:00:20.789> you<00:00:20.910> were<00:00:21.000> eight<00:00:21.180> noob<00:00:21.810> or<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.170> pro<00:00:22.680> having<00:00:23.609> a

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
if you were eight noob or a pro having a

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.740 
if you were eight noob or a pro having a
proper<00:00:24.240> field<00:00:24.420> of<00:00:24.660> view<00:00:24.810> or<00:00:25.220> fov<00:00:26.220> is<00:00:26.630> one<00:00:27.630> of

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
proper field of view or fov is one of

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.230 
proper field of view or fov is one of
the<00:00:27.840> most<00:00:28.140> important<00:00:28.890> things<00:00:29.279> you<00:00:29.429> can<00:00:29.699> do<00:00:29.939> in

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
the most important things you can do in

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.290 
the most important things you can do in
any<00:00:30.810> sim<00:00:31.349> every<00:00:32.189> sim<00:00:32.460> supports<00:00:32.940> this<00:00:33.059> feature

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
any sim every sim supports this feature

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.870 
any sim every sim supports this feature
I<00:00:33.690> should<00:00:34.530> say<00:00:34.710> every<00:00:35.010> sim<00:00:35.280> within<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.730> last

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
I should say every sim within the last

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.569 
I should say every sim within the last
15<00:00:36.510> years<00:00:36.540> supports<00:00:37.380> this<00:00:37.500> feature<00:00:37.710> so<00:00:38.010> this

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
15 years supports this feature so this

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:39.920 
15 years supports this feature so this
is<00:00:38.730> something<00:00:38.940> that<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.300> should<00:00:39.329> be<00:00:39.719> doing

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
is something that you should be doing

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.440 
is something that you should be doing
and<00:00:40.350> you<00:00:40.829> should<00:00:41.129> take<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.700> steps<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.090> ensure

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
and you should take the steps to ensure

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.170 
and you should take the steps to ensure
that<00:00:42.480> you<00:00:42.809> are<00:00:42.840> using<00:00:43.140> a<00:00:43.440> proper<00:00:43.890> F<00:00:44.040> now<00:00:45.000> one<00:00:45.149> of

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
that you are using a proper F now one of

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.660 
that you are using a proper F now one of
the<00:00:45.329> biggest<00:00:45.660> downsides<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:46.860> proper<00:00:47.520> field

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
the biggest downsides to a proper field

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.790 
the biggest downsides to a proper field
of<00:00:47.910> view<00:00:48.059> is<00:00:48.300> if<00:00:48.510> you<00:00:49.020> have<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.140> single<00:00:49.500> screen

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
of view is if you have a single screen

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.170 
of view is if you have a single screen
setup<00:00:50.190> it's<00:00:50.430> going<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.670> look<00:00:50.850> like<00:00:50.969> you're

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
setup it's going to look like you're

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.740 
setup it's going to look like you're
driving<00:00:51.420> slow<00:00:52.190> because<00:00:53.190> quote<00:00:53.610> unquote<00:00:53.760> sense

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
driving slow because quote unquote sense

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.139 
driving slow because quote unquote sense
of<00:00:54.960> speed<00:00:55.320> but<00:00:55.949> your<00:00:56.100> sense<00:00:56.340> of<00:00:56.489> speed<00:00:56.730> is<00:00:56.879> just

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
of speed but your sense of speed is just

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.029 
of speed but your sense of speed is just
that<00:00:57.360> it's<00:00:57.629> created<00:00:58.109> by<00:00:58.230> your<00:00:58.350> peripheral

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
that it's created by your peripheral

00:00:59.039 --> 00:00:59.479 
that it's created by your peripheral
vision

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
vision

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.880 
vision
it<00:01:00.359> doesn't<00:01:00.719> actually<00:01:00.899> happen<00:01:01.320> there<00:01:01.649> is<00:01:01.739> no

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
it doesn't actually happen there is no

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.880 
it doesn't actually happen there is no
motion<00:01:02.670> blur<00:01:03.059> in<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.510> real<00:01:04.199> world<00:01:04.500> or

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
motion blur in the real world or

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.460 
motion blur in the real world or
anything<00:01:05.129> like<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:05.810> what<00:01:06.810> your<00:01:07.020> field<00:01:07.320> of

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
anything like that what your field of

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.260 
anything like that what your field of
view<00:01:07.619> should<00:01:07.920> replicate<00:01:08.130> is<00:01:08.640> what<00:01:08.939> you<00:01:09.090> would

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
view should replicate is what you would

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.630 
view should replicate is what you would
see<00:01:09.330> sitting<00:01:10.080> in<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.409> car<00:01:10.710> with<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.220> size<00:01:11.460> of

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
see sitting in the car with the size of

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.179 
see sitting in the car with the size of
your<00:01:11.760> monitor<00:01:12.110> basically<00:01:13.110> as<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.560> window<00:01:13.950> if

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
your monitor basically as the window if

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.530 
your monitor basically as the window if
that<00:01:14.700> makes<00:01:14.909> any<00:01:15.030> sense

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
that makes any sense

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.999 
that makes any sense
this<00:01:16.049> picture<00:01:16.470> that<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:16.710> see<00:01:16.860> in<00:01:16.920> the

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
this picture that you see in the

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.649 
this picture that you see in the
background<00:01:17.460> should<00:01:17.729> make<00:01:17.939> that<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.150> little<00:01:18.540> bit

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
background should make that a little bit

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.859 
background should make that a little bit
clearer<00:01:18.990> for<00:01:19.020> you<00:01:19.549> the<00:01:20.549> box<00:01:20.850> is<00:01:21.150> essentially

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
clearer for you the box is essentially

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.859 
clearer for you the box is essentially
your<00:01:22.290> window<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:23.130> world<00:01:23.369> as<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:24.360> Box<00:01:24.600> gets

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
your window to the world as the Box gets

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.440 
your window to the world as the Box gets
smaller<00:01:25.290> your<00:01:25.770> field<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.220> view<00:01:26.369> is<00:01:26.580> decreasing

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
smaller your field of view is decreasing

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.929 
smaller your field of view is decreasing
as<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.869> Box<00:01:28.080> gets<00:01:28.380> larger<00:01:28.979> your<00:01:29.430> field<00:01:29.759> of

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
as the Box gets larger your field of

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.569 
as the Box gets larger your field of
view<00:01:30.060> is<00:01:30.240> increasing<00:01:31.110> but<00:01:31.860> your<00:01:32.189> field<00:01:32.430> of

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
view is increasing but your field of

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.429 
view is increasing but your field of
view<00:01:32.790> should<00:01:32.880> replicate<00:01:33.780> what<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.110> actually

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
view should replicate what you actually

you<00:01:47.130> should<00:01:47.369> bug<00:01:47.610> every<00:01:48.030> sim<00:01:48.360> racing

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
you should bug every sim racing

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.240 
you should bug every sim racing
developer<00:01:49.140> out<00:01:49.290> there<00:01:49.320> for<00:01:49.770> because<00:01:49.950> it

developer out there for because it

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.679 
developer out there for because it
should<00:01:50.460> be<00:01:50.579> something<00:01:50.970> that<00:01:51.000> is<00:01:51.240> in<00:01:51.390> with

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.240 
of view calculators out there if I move
my<00:03:26.940> monitor<00:03:27.570> closer<00:03:27.930> I<00:03:28.320> can<00:03:28.650> run<00:03:28.920> a<00:03:28.950> higher

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
my monitor closer I can run a higher

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.120 
my monitor closer I can run a higher
field<00:03:29.549> of<00:03:29.730> view<00:03:29.880> if<00:03:30.060> you<00:03:30.180> think<00:03:30.390> about<00:03:30.480> glasses

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
field of view if you think about glasses

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.830 
field of view if you think about glasses
or<00:03:32.130> alternatively<00:03:32.760> perhaps<00:03:32.970> more<00:03:33.299> fitting<00:03:33.660> a

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
or alternatively perhaps more fitting a

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.020 
or alternatively perhaps more fitting a
helmet-mounted<00:03:34.530> display<00:03:34.769> such<00:03:35.430> as<00:03:35.459> the

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
helmet-mounted display such as the

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.300 
helmet-mounted display such as the
oculus<00:03:36.450> rift<00:03:36.540> it's<00:03:37.410> a<00:03:37.530> really<00:03:37.739> small<00:03:37.950> screen

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
oculus rift it's a really small screen

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.620 
oculus rift it's a really small screen
but<00:03:38.340> it's<00:03:38.640> really<00:03:38.880> really<00:03:39.090> close<00:03:39.390> to<00:03:39.420> your

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
but it's really really close to your

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.930 
but it's really really close to your
face<00:03:39.840> so<00:03:40.350> you<00:03:40.440> get<00:03:40.560> a<00:03:40.590> huge<00:03:41.010> field<00:03:41.310> of<00:03:41.519> view<00:03:41.730> if

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
face so you get a huge field of view if

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.800 
face so you get a huge field of view if
you<00:03:42.600> have<00:03:42.810> you<00:03:43.230> know<00:03:43.290> a<00:03:43.500> 30<00:03:44.220> inch<00:03:44.400> TV<00:03:44.850> 16<00:03:45.540> feet

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
you have you know a 30 inch TV 16 feet

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.780 
you have you know a 30 inch TV 16 feet
away<00:03:45.959> you're<00:03:46.709> going<00:03:46.860> to<00:03:46.920> have<00:03:47.010> a<00:03:47.040> really<00:03:47.430> small

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
away you're going to have a really small

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.940 
away you're going to have a really small
window<00:03:48.090> to<00:03:48.360> the<00:03:48.630> world<00:03:48.810> so<00:03:49.590> that's<00:03:49.709> why<00:03:49.890> you

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
window to the world so that's why you

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.199 
window to the world so that's why you
want<00:03:50.190> to<00:03:50.250> try<00:03:50.370> and<00:03:50.489> get<00:03:50.579> your<00:03:50.700> monitor<00:03:51.060> as

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
want to try and get your monitor as

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.210 
want to try and get your monitor as
close<00:03:51.510> as<00:03:51.720> you<00:03:51.840> possibly<00:03:52.230> can<00:03:52.470> as<00:03:52.739> comfortably

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
close as you possibly can as comfortably

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.400 
close as you possibly can as comfortably
as<00:03:53.459> you<00:03:53.610> can<00:03:53.850> don't<00:03:54.120> go<00:03:54.299> blind<00:03:54.600> in<00:03:54.870> the<00:03:54.959> process

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
as you can don't go blind in the process

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:57.590 
as you can don't go blind in the process
that<00:03:56.070> way<00:03:56.190> you<00:03:56.250> can<00:03:56.579> get<00:03:56.730> a<00:03:56.790> larger<00:03:57.180> field<00:03:57.329> of

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
that way you can get a larger field of

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.690 
that way you can get a larger field of
view<00:03:57.780> why<00:03:58.650> do<00:03:58.709> you<00:03:58.829> want<00:03:59.010> a<00:03:59.070> large<00:03:59.280> field<00:03:59.549> of

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
view why do you want a large field of

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:00.979 
view why do you want a large field of
view<00:03:59.760> because<00:04:00.209> that<00:04:00.510> way<00:04:00.630> you<00:04:00.690> get<00:04:00.930> more

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
view because that way you get more

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.590 
view because that way you get more
information<00:04:01.350> on<00:04:02.100> screen<00:04:02.430> and<00:04:02.790> at<00:04:03.239> the<00:04:03.390> same

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
information on screen and at the same

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.990 
information on screen and at the same
time<00:04:03.840> it<00:04:04.049> is<00:04:04.170> still<00:04:04.530> correct<00:04:05.340> to<00:04:05.670> how<00:04:05.820> it

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
time it is still correct to how it

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.699 
time it is still correct to how it
should<00:04:06.269> actually<00:04:06.450> look<00:04:06.810> this<00:04:07.380> will<00:04:07.620> mean

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
should actually look this will mean

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:08.960 
should actually look this will mean
you'll<00:04:07.890> have<00:04:08.010> more<00:04:08.220> peripheral<00:04:08.640> vision

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
you'll have more peripheral vision

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.340 
you'll have more peripheral vision
you'll<00:04:09.120> be<00:04:09.239> able<00:04:09.299> to<00:04:09.480> see<00:04:09.690> more<00:04:09.870> of<00:04:09.989> the<00:04:10.079> track

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
you'll be able to see more of the track

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:11.750 
you'll be able to see more of the track
you're<00:04:10.890> going<00:04:11.010> to<00:04:11.070> be<00:04:11.190> able<00:04:11.250> to<00:04:11.430> see<00:04:11.640> your

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
you're going to be able to see your

you're going to be able to see your
mirrors<00:04:12.120> maybe<00:04:12.390> perhaps<00:04:12.720> it's<00:04:13.560> important<00:04:14.130> to

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
mirrors maybe perhaps it's important to

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.130 
mirrors maybe perhaps it's important to
get<00:04:14.489> as<00:04:14.670> large<00:04:14.850> of<00:04:15.090> a<00:04:15.180> field<00:04:15.420> of<00:04:15.570> view<00:04:15.750> as<00:04:15.959> you

get as large of a field of view as you

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.920 
get as large of a field of view as you
possibly<00:04:16.709> can<00:04:17.070> while<00:04:17.609> still<00:04:17.669> maintaining<00:04:18.180> the

are a couple of exceptions and a couple

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
of things that you probably will need to

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:29.750 
of things that you probably will need to
consider<00:04:25.500> and<00:04:25.830> that<00:04:26.490> is<00:04:26.930> comfort<00:04:28.340> using<00:04:29.340> a<00:04:29.490> low

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.580 
consider and that is comfort using a low
field<00:04:30.030> of<00:04:30.210> view<00:04:30.330> like<00:04:30.570> you'll<00:04:30.780> have<00:04:30.960> to<00:04:31.140> use<00:04:31.169> on

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
field of view like you'll have to use on

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.100 
field of view like you'll have to use on
a<00:04:31.620> single<00:04:31.890> monitor<00:04:32.460> is<00:04:32.640> very<00:04:33.630> uncomfortable

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
a single monitor is very uncomfortable

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.040 
a single monitor is very uncomfortable
you<00:04:34.560> can't<00:04:34.830> really<00:04:35.039> see<00:04:35.490> around<00:04:35.970> you<00:04:36.300> so<00:04:36.930> what

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
you can't really see around you so what

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.719 
you can't really see around you so what
is<00:04:37.169> common<00:04:37.530> is<00:04:37.620> people<00:04:38.010> will<00:04:38.130> bump<00:04:38.370> it<00:04:38.490> up<00:04:38.580> a

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:38.729 
is common is people will bump it up a

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:40.940 
is common is people will bump it up a
little<00:04:38.940> bit<00:04:39.150> to<00:04:39.960> try<00:04:40.140> and<00:04:40.289> compensate<00:04:40.470> for

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 
little bit to try and compensate for

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:42.130 
little bit to try and compensate for
that<00:04:41.010> give<00:04:41.310> you<00:04:41.400> a<00:04:41.460> little<00:04:41.550> bit<00:04:41.729> more

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:42.140 
that give you a little bit more

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.270 
that give you a little bit more
peripheral<00:04:43.140> vision<00:04:43.440> but<00:04:43.590> at<00:04:43.680> the<00:04:43.770> same<00:04:43.950> time

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280

still<00:04:45.150> keep<00:04:45.360> it<00:04:45.510> accurate<00:04:45.950> personally<00:04:46.950> I

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
still keep it accurate personally I

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:48.800 
still keep it accurate personally I
believe<00:04:47.190> you<00:04:47.490> should<00:04:47.520> go<00:04:47.789> no<00:04:48.030> more<00:04:48.300> than<00:04:48.510> 10

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
believe you should go no more than 10

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.779 
believe you should go no more than 10
degrees<00:04:48.960> more<00:04:49.740> than<00:04:50.070> what<00:04:50.250> your<00:04:50.400> actual

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:50.789 
degrees more than what your actual

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:53.029 
degrees more than what your actual
correct<00:04:51.270> field<00:04:51.570> of<00:04:51.750> view<00:04:51.870> is<00:04:52.050> because<00:04:52.800> if<00:04:52.950> you

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:53.039 
correct field of view is because if you

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:54.920 
correct field of view is because if you
do<00:04:53.190> start<00:04:53.460> going<00:04:53.700> too<00:04:53.820> terribly<00:04:54.180> much<00:04:54.360> you'll

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
do start going too terribly much you'll

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.960 
do start going too terribly much you'll
start<00:04:55.110> to<00:04:55.349> lose<00:04:55.590> all<00:04:55.890> depth<00:04:56.190> perception<00:04:56.820> that

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
start to lose all depth perception that

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.870 
start to lose all depth perception that
you<00:04:57.090> naturally<00:04:57.539> would<00:04:57.780> have<00:04:57.960> anyways<00:04:58.669> this<00:04:59.669> is

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
you naturally would have anyways this is

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.460 
you naturally would have anyways this is
something<00:05:00.210> that<00:05:00.390> would<00:05:00.479> change<00:05:00.780> depending<00:05:01.349> on

at the difference in the field of views
this<00:05:56.010> is<00:05:56.070> what<00:05:56.400> I<00:05:56.430> want<00:05:56.640> to<00:05:56.729> really<00:05:56.909> stress

00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:57.419 
this is what I want to really stress

00:05:57.419 --> 00:05:59.480 
this is what I want to really stress
with<00:05:57.659> this<00:05:57.810> video<00:05:57.960> and<00:05:58.260> why<00:05:58.380> I<00:05:58.650> did<00:05:59.250> both<00:05:59.460> the

00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.490 
with this video and why I did both the

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.820 
with this video and why I did both the
pictures<00:06:00.000> as<00:06:00.210> well<00:06:00.479> as<00:06:00.599> the<00:06:00.720> videos<00:06:01.080> just

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
pictures as well as the videos just

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.980 
pictures as well as the videos just
notice<00:06:02.190> how<00:06:02.220> much<00:06:02.550> faster<00:06:03.240> it<00:06:03.419> looks<00:06:03.690> like<00:06:03.870> I'm

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:03.990 
notice how much faster it looks like I'm

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:06.080 
notice how much faster it looks like I'm
going<00:06:04.200> into<00:06:04.530> the<00:06:04.620> brake<00:06:04.830> zones<00:06:05.130> that's<00:06:05.729> less

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:06.090 
going into the brake zones that's less

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:08.600 
going into the brake zones that's less
control<00:06:06.659> that's<00:06:06.930> less<00:06:07.169> car<00:06:07.530> placement<00:06:08.159> you

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:08.610 
control that's less car placement you

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:10.070 
control that's less car placement you
know<00:06:08.700> if<00:06:08.760> you<00:06:08.820> look<00:06:08.970> at<00:06:09.120> turn<00:06:09.360> one<00:06:09.390> here<00:06:09.960> at
