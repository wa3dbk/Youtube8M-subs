00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.149
 then we want to say that the grams 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.149
 more arms 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.500
 the falls we recently saw a story 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.760
 about the forces that there are on which 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:17.760
 it's not easy and that speed but 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.760
 yes 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.250
 participate in bicycle rides 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:29.310
 night then they can follow 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:31.080
 visit kaz ast and visit houses with gas and 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.630
 night walks are made in the city 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.460
 They are very safe on Wednesdays in the 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.620
 night and now if we go to the other side of 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.840
 study in this segment is sponsored 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.079
 all visible 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.079
 [Applause] 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:51.489
 thank you very much from the study 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:54.580
 that is the nightly walk goes with the 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:58.630
 back pack with the chelas back I think 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:01:04.330
 that part of this beyond that 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:07.540
 we obviously appreciate that you knew and 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.820
 that we enjoy this we also did the 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.290
 bike we do not know much about bicycles and 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.140
 everything of competition then in what 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.810
 there is a competition bicycle 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:20.880
 Exactly 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:23.979
 of two things steering wheel and seats doing 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.060
 ads and tires in addition from the 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:28.570
 ironwork 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:31.270
 involves stars pedals rays hand 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.680
 Handlebar posters today on the pedals 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.260
 are these that go 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.320
 they are types more or less so that 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:42.380
 let's understand how skiing and how you get 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:45.620
 with a movement of your skin 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:48.410
 with the caÃ±ada they realized that if 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:51.170
 you're tied the bike and go with you and 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:53.420
 they could hurt you with the stars or 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.930
 you could go you have agreed with a 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.270
 bicycle here in vigo at the time of 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.640
 you are going to make the movement and the 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.770
 bicycle will go on one side and you go and 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.220
 on the other the other little gem in security and 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.440
 subway 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.440
 drive speedometer quotes the heart rate monitor 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.510
 and the position is that they are imputed 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.970
 stooped do not give them back pain 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.950
 clear that if we as cyclists and 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.770
 so long we have problems of 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:29.380
 back but that is a consequence of what 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:29.380
 What do you see as you're deadened between 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:38.710
 but I assure you that the seat takes you 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.710
 an awesome darling the sky 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:54.900
 both are two bottles have your 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.299
 changes that are no longer like before 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:01.340
 they were levers here are changes eliminate 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:05.400
 kind like Formula 1 cars for not 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:09.109
 to walk and the truth is that there are lately 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.109
 electronic changes 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:20.389
 is the question but look how abused the 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:23.180
 production of this program that we 

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:25.579
 he worked for the scale 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:32.260
 approximately as soon as possible 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:35.260
 weigh between 8 and 10 kilos the bicycles 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.260
 exactly 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.669
 television 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.870
 we light it 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.580
 in kilos 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.300
 summarizing the basis for them to have two 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.270
 functions 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:04.840
 speak you have that you alone the charges not 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.840
 has exit 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:11.360
 those who have to be as is 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:16.600
 necessary 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.600
 since if 3 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.150
 good 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:44.479
 what is the heaviest part but I have 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:46.159
 understood that an authority that reviews 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:48.729
 the bicycle so that it does not have any 

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:48.729
 scam 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:59.889
 he began to see and so free the part 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:02.400
 that the seat is not forward 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:06.070
 so that no pedals 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:07.830
 there must always be a rule that you 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:12.539
 knee must be at a height 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.539
 proportional of the axis of your center 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:19.710
 lately they do not leave the disk anymore 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:23.580
 for route competitions for 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:27.240
 their competencies to level in the 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:28.980
 competition and assess myself to the not 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.090
 they began to realize that it was like 

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:34.630
 swimwear 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:37.620
 swimming helped you a lot more than 

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:37.620
 what is the human being 

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:46.630
 but I would like to be invited as 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:49.540
 whenever you want, I would be with 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:51.400
 great pleasure here narrating is a shame and 

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:52.300
 we have to dismiss shorter program 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.910
 of normal 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:06:02.280
 thank you to see if for again with more 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:06:02.280
 inviting thank you very much 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:09.010
 good 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.010
 [Applause] 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.290
 I would need more up 

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:24.490
 now with the rain
