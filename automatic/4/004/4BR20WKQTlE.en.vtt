 truth and then those are beans can 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.530
 to be something I do know is the night 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.120
 previous if they are of lacquer rinses the 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.519
 that do not have as much salt 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.230
 those are frozen vegetables are you 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:06.170
 using many colors means that 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.570
 provide many essential vitamins and 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.750
 some tomatitos also to have something 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:14.780
 fresh is something that can be done when 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.789
 I look at you like no lunchbox 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.460
 you have none so with the ham a 

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:21.970
 little turkey of what you have and then you 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.890
 put the extensions on 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.869
 Swiss consumer 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.970
 You can put a little Latin flavor and 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.220
 you already did not have to refrigerate it 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.020
 as one generates for my son for lunch 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.979
 that's for adults for children but 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.610
 Super full of color is super fun 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:41.020
 the plate 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.020
 how nice 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:49.550
 but not a good way to control the 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:55.180
 portions expose and expose it in the 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:55.180
 dish and then flip it upside down 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:14.540
 but this portion is not treated many 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.640
 lots again when the kids 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.920
 they are eating too much sweets 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.959
 good way to do it are fruits what 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.690
 what you have to think with each meal is 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.670
 what is surrounding them or 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.130
 foreseeing my children so they can 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:30.500
 eat in a very nutritious way 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:33.290
 then this is what I do my house 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.470

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:39.470

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.840

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.959
 you put on the plates like this 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:53.769
 and different colors and then you can 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:53.769
 put a little bit me bulls up 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:02.760
 and you can put the yogurt up 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:06.540

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:09.420
