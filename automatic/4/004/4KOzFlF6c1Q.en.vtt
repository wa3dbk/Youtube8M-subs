00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.910 
started playing he Rimouski that's kind
of<00:00:16.000> when<00:00:16.150> I<00:00:16.180> started<00:00:16.539> to<00:00:16.630> get<00:00:16.750> into<00:00:17.019> it<00:00:17.050> and<00:00:17.349> I

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:17.920 
of when I started to get into it and I

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.500 
of when I started to get into it and I
started<00:00:18.160> to<00:00:18.279> think<00:00:18.310> well<00:00:18.609> maybe<00:00:18.820> I<00:00:18.910> could<00:00:19.420> play

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:19.510 
started to think well maybe I could play

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:21.899 
started to think well maybe I could play
hockey<00:00:19.689> as<00:00:19.960> well<00:00:19.990> for<00:00:20.619> Adam<00:00:21.009> I<00:00:21.099> think<00:00:21.159> I<00:00:21.579> I

00:00:21.899 --> 00:00:21.909 
hockey as well for Adam I think I I

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:24.450 
hockey as well for Adam I think I I
started<00:00:22.570> to<00:00:22.659> play<00:00:22.869> and<00:00:23.199> I<00:00:23.259> noticed<00:00:23.739> like<00:00:23.919> I<00:00:24.130> was

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:24.460 
started to play and I noticed like I was

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.099 
started to play and I noticed like I was
getting<00:00:24.789> pretty<00:00:24.909> good<00:00:25.060> so<00:00:25.539> that's<00:00:25.900> when<00:00:26.079> I

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:26.109 
getting pretty good so that's when I

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:27.659 
getting pretty good so that's when I
thought<00:00:26.319> well<00:00:26.589> maybe<00:00:26.859> I<00:00:26.980> should<00:00:27.220> take<00:00:27.400> it<00:00:27.550> more

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:27.669 
thought well maybe I should take it more

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:29.220 
thought well maybe I should take it more
seriously<00:00:28.150> and<00:00:28.300> start<00:00:28.449> actually<00:00:28.989> like

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230 
seriously and start actually like

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.919 
seriously and start actually like
looking<00:00:30.099> at<00:00:30.189> it<00:00:30.220> it's<00:00:30.550> more<00:00:30.759> future<00:00:31.749> for

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:31.929 
looking at it it's more future for

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:34.680 
looking at it it's more future for
myself<00:00:32.050> I<00:00:32.610> only<00:00:33.610> started<00:00:33.940> playing<00:00:34.030> when<00:00:34.390> I<00:00:34.480> was

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:34.690 
myself I only started playing when I was

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.200 
myself I only started playing when I was
like<00:00:35.410> four<00:00:35.649> years<00:00:35.680> ago<00:00:36.100> so<00:00:36.340> I<00:00:36.609> knew<00:00:37.000> nothing

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 
like four years ago so I knew nothing

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.270 
like four years ago so I knew nothing
about<00:00:37.480> hockey<00:00:37.899> I<00:00:38.109> like<00:00:38.680> a<00:00:38.710> new<00:00:39.100> book

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.280 
about hockey I like a new book

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.650 
about hockey I like a new book
goaltending<00:00:39.789> really<00:00:40.120> so<00:00:40.809> I<00:00:41.820> think<00:00:42.820> just<00:00:43.449> like

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660 
goaltending really so I think just like

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.990 
goaltending really so I think just like
quickness<00:00:44.019> and<00:00:44.620> learning<00:00:45.340> what<00:00:45.579> actually<00:00:45.940> you

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 
quickness and learning what actually you

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.189 
quickness and learning what actually you
have<00:00:46.090> to<00:00:46.210> do<00:00:46.329> and<00:00:46.600> where<00:00:46.690> you<00:00:46.809> have<00:00:46.929> to<00:00:47.050> be

00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:47.199 
have to do and where you have to be

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:49.229 
have to do and where you have to be
there's<00:00:47.530> a<00:00:47.649> certain<00:00:47.949> shot<00:00:48.160> that's<00:00:48.550> really

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
there's a certain shot that's really

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:50.180 
there's a certain shot that's really
what<00:00:49.359> I<00:00:49.390> improved

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
what I improved

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.369 
what I improved
how<00:00:50.730> committed<00:00:51.090> are<00:00:51.329> you<00:00:51.480> how<00:00:51.750> much<00:00:51.930> time<00:00:52.199> give

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
how committed are you how much time give

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.560 
how committed are you how much time give
me<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.500> census<00:00:52.949> that<00:00:52.980> how<00:00:53.550> much<00:00:53.699> time<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.210> spend

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
me a census that how much time you spend

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.540 
me a census that how much time you spend
of<00:00:55.440> course<00:00:55.680> we<00:00:55.860> see<00:00:56.039> their<00:00:56.250> weeks

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.520 

I'm<00:00:59.550> not<00:00:59.700> sure<00:00:59.970> we<00:01:00.390> have<00:01:00.420> practice<00:01:01.200> almost

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
I'm not sure we have practice almost

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.820 
I'm not sure we have practice almost
every<00:01:01.950> day<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.340> we<00:01:02.400> have<00:01:02.550> off<00:01:02.880> place<00:01:03.210> but

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:03.830 
every day and we have off place but

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.740 
every day and we have off place but
school<00:01:04.830> is<00:01:04.890> important<00:01:05.309> too<00:01:05.550> so<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:06.000> try<00:01:06.300> to<00:01:06.360> kind

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
school is important too so I try to kind

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:07.490 
school is important too so I try to kind
of<00:01:06.840> balance<00:01:07.140> that<00:01:07.200> out

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
of balance that out

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.150 
of balance that out
so<00:01:07.770> probably<00:01:08.250> I<00:01:08.640> try<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.470> coffee<00:01:10.470> every<00:01:10.860> try<00:01:11.100> to

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:11.160 
so probably I try to coffee every try to

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.310 
so probably I try to coffee every try to
do<00:01:11.250> it<00:01:11.340> every<00:01:11.400> day<00:01:11.670> then<00:01:12.600> watch<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.990> game<00:01:13.170> here
