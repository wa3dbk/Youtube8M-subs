00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.170
 code

 just as we already knew the 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.549
 animal sharing crossing by 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.049
 example of painting clothes from

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:19.590

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:24.540
 to within our mpb and inter people 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:28.110
 can become secret friend coupons 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.299
 would be a name in the translation Portuguese 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.520
 and then with the people and can 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.579
 interact battling and everything else 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.290
 It is also known that you will be able to put 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.520
 those same things that we already 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.070
 I knew you 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:45.930
 in older games that are by 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:49.259
 Example plush Pokémon Traps 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:52.680
 on the floor decorations all type and also 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.270
 as in older games to 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.570
 people will have to use an attack on 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:00.360
 tree on broken walls in some 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.149
 places that have a possibility of 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.000
 create a cpi to create our own and me 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.190
 I found this incredible was something that 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.250
 people already speculated who watched there 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.630
 the things we most want to see your 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.280
 daughter 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.920
 just this was mentioned to people 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.330
 wants to see your kisses back and it's very 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.830
 cool that they really get back on a 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.200
 litigation to make them really 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.150
 will come back so eager to make mine and 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.580
 share with you for you 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.720
 access is more legal, it is also 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.580
 You do not understand, do not you? 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.590
 you will not need to be my friend 13 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.080
 10 to be able to save itself Spanish 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.910
 My car where you can enter the 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.310
 mine always fish more or less like 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.680
 a crossing animal has the city of 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.280
 dreams you go there sleep you can access 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.660
 any city of the animal crossing 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.520
 through a world of dreams 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.650
 so you can not if you 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.240
 spoil a flower in bloom will not stay 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.620
 in charge of you only during 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.500
 That dream when you leave will not 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.110
 affect anything in the real city right 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.170
 I think it's very cool of the acronym in 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:04.080
 new english it's very beautiful feel 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.130
 a care with details like this is 3d 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.620
 it's cool 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.870
 I really hope that in addition they 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:13.400
 There were more things, but if it was 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:16.170
 what was great is already a change 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.060
 cool in relation to the original né 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.360
 there is one thing I forgot to comment on 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.010
 that the cycle of sticks can pass 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:26.520
 powers to friends more or less 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:30.420
 As I had in x and y yesterday, a x and y used 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:33.120
 powers, for example to make it easier for 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:36.930
 eggs shock faster this kind of 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.160
 thing the five sticks can make ones with 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.720
 the others 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.110
 Another cool thing they announced 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:46.080
 a new name character is arune and this one 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:48.690
 character is a ti expert in five and ten 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.970
 Sometimes he has a good fly and he is one day. 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.310
 before traveling the world but during the 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.380
 man heard his daughter is living in 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.140
 rouen temporarily found interesting 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:01.590
 the fact that he is a traveler because that 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:03.570
 gives us a clue that it is possible that 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.810
 This same character starts the level 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:09.630
 come back in other franchise games, right? 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:12.840
 It may be that he does not come back but it's a 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:15.230
 track is the fact that he is a traveler 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:19.079
 because they thought he is a traveler 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:20.549
 He decorates things I think is a 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.380
 hint that it may appear in other 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.380
 games and you know I'm a bad guess 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.500
 then this may not mean 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.500
 no crap 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:33.830
 I also forgot to mention that 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.160
 uncertainties can be shared by 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.080
 tripods 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.470
 so when you have a tripod in the 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:45.360
 society you go automatically 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:45.660
 share your ideas on son silva 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.400
 huh 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.860
 I find it very interesting because it also goes 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.330
 increase this interaction this visit to 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.240
 five countries of the 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.190
 has this point of interest is a bit 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.919
 greater - you access if the weight of the 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:01.830
 others just to get the flag and win 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:04.110
 a score improve your level than 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:06.870
 It has in simple besni a thing 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.639
 related to battles will not affect 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.160
 not at all competitive 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:12.660
 apparently but it's quite cool the other 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.460
 cool thing is that within your 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:15.660
 you 'll be able to create 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.940
 battle 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.620
 one does not have much detail of what is going to 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:22.169
 exactly those rules of battles by 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:25.110
 example I'm a super fan of 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:27.930
 trio then you can make your 

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:29.700
 liquidity itself from the trio's battle and you 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.740
 can create in there as if it were a 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.780
 gym and you are a gym leader and 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:36.780
 your daughters bees this I found a lot 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:38.669
 Nice you, at least when I was 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:41.580
 11 year old I had that 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:43.410
 that curiosity that will of 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.169
 to abandon this is a gym leader and 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:47.099
 if challenged by coaches, right? 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:50.070
 This you will be able to do things 

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:51.180
 awesome I found it very cool and 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:53.729
 funny 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:56.669
 I understand this possibility of battling 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:06:00.330
 until 2010 and that the battle rule then 

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:01.979
 even have those battles in reverse that 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:04.860
 existed that were created in pokémon 

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:07.770
 same day physical weaknesses are the 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:10.610
 otherwise in reverse battles 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:13.440
 the water pokémons, for example of the 100 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:17.390
 weak electrical strikes they resist 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:20.300
 nor the attack of water in perspective 

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:22.520
 also by Moscow resist the attacks of 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.740
 Water is a trip but it would be nice 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.810
 take it inside too if you 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:30.910
 I want to have to download the 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:34.370

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:38.720
 comment with pinion beauty
