now the brig is incapacitated so we can

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.960 
now the brig is incapacitated so we can
board<00:02:56.600> him<00:02:56.750> if<00:02:56.960> we<00:02:57.230> choose<00:02:57.470> to<00:02:57.550> but<00:02:58.550> since<00:02:58.790> we

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
board him if we choose to but since we

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.670 
board him if we choose to but since we
still<00:02:59.180> have<00:02:59.300> a<00:02:59.330> tower<00:02:59.540> to<00:02:59.750> deal<00:02:59.900> with<00:03:00.140> we'll

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
still have a tower to deal with we'll

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.230 
still have a tower to deal with we'll
take<00:03:00.860> them<00:03:01.010> down<00:03:01.220> and<00:03:01.490> go<00:03:01.610> finish<00:03:01.910> off<00:03:02.060> this

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.240 
take them down and go finish off this

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.800 
take them down and go finish off this
boy

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810

even though we can the fort these towers

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.330 
even though we can the fort these towers
still<00:03:10.690> do<00:03:10.900> a<00:03:10.930> lot<00:03:11.230> of<00:03:11.260> damage<00:03:11.590> so<00:03:12.040> we<00:03:12.160> still

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
still do a lot of damage so we still

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:27.119 
still do a lot of damage so we still
have<00:03:12.400> to<00:03:12.610> brace<00:03:12.849> to<00:03:13.030> defend<00:03:13.330> ourselves

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:29.659 
now that the towers are down we need to

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:31.720 
now that the towers are down we need to
