it's going to work very similarly to the

it's going to work very similarly to the
way<00:01:38.640> that<00:01:39.119> Sprint<00:01:39.570> does<00:01:39.840> just<00:01:40.170> with<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.320> robe

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
speed one of those things will just have

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.740 
speed one of those things will just have
to<00:01:44.100> wait<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:44.369> see<00:01:44.430> another<00:01:45.299> thing<00:01:45.540> is<00:01:45.720> that

to wait and see another thing is that

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.149 
to wait and see another thing is that
they<00:01:45.960> are<00:01:46.049> going<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.350> have<00:01:46.500> reduced<00:01:46.950> fall

they are going to have reduced fall
damage<00:01:47.490> I<00:01:47.610> would<00:01:47.820> assume<00:01:48.030> this<00:01:48.180> is<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.420> repass

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750

we<00:01:50.850> just<00:01:51.030> know<00:01:51.210> that<00:01:51.240> they<00:01:51.479> will<00:01:51.720> have<00:01:51.930> a<00:01:51.960> way

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
we just know that they will have a way

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.960 
we just know that they will have a way
to<00:01:52.229> reduce<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.799> amount<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:53.130> fall<00:01:53.399> damage<00:01:53.790> that

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
to reduce the amount of fall damage that

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.850 
to reduce the amount of fall damage that
they<00:01:54.149> take<00:01:54.390> now<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:55.020> big<00:01:55.170> thing<00:01:55.200> with<00:01:55.470> them<00:01:55.649> is

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
they take now the big thing with them is

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.310 
they take now the big thing with them is
the<00:01:56.130> ability<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.520> apply<00:01:56.939> poisons<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:58.110> their

the ability to apply poisons to their

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.440 
the ability to apply poisons to their
blades<00:01:58.680> they<00:01:59.130> will<00:01:59.250> be<00:01:59.369> able<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.820> go<00:02:00.060> into<00:02:00.210> what

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
blades they will be able to go into what

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.030 
blades they will be able to go into what
seems<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.780> be<00:02:00.869> stances<00:02:01.530> that<00:02:01.710> look<00:02:01.860> very

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
seems to be stances that look very

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.010 
seems to be stances that look very
similar<00:02:02.460> to<00:02:02.640> fists<00:02:02.880> of<00:02:03.060> Earth<00:02:03.270> Wind<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:03.750> Fire

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
similar to fists of Earth Wind and Fire

that<00:02:04.290> monk<00:02:04.530> has<00:02:04.710> just<00:02:05.219> based<00:02:05.430> on<00:02:05.610> the

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
that monk has just based on the

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.609 
that monk has just based on the
animation<00:02:06.270> for<00:02:06.390> actually<00:02:06.840> applying<00:02:07.320> the

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
animation for actually applying the

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.499 
animation for actually applying the
poison<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.190> your<00:02:08.340> daggers<00:02:08.729> now<00:02:09.179> different

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
poison to your daggers now different

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.270 
poison to your daggers now different
poisons<00:02:09.690> while<00:02:10.050> different<00:02:10.229> effects<00:02:10.739> so<00:02:10.890> we

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
poisons while different effects so we

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.740 
poisons while different effects so we
can<00:02:11.430> assume<00:02:11.640> that<00:02:11.700> they<00:02:11.940> will<00:02:12.060> have<00:02:12.209> some<00:02:12.239> PvE

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
can assume that they will have some PvE

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.280 
can assume that they will have some PvE
you

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
you

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.649 
you
and<00:02:13.530> PvP<00:02:14.159> uses<00:02:14.519> but<00:02:14.700> only<00:02:15.090> time<00:02:15.450> will<00:02:15.510> tell

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659 
and PvP uses but only time will tell

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:17.479 
and PvP uses but only time will tell
again<00:02:16.049> guys<00:02:16.260> all<00:02:16.530> we<00:02:16.650> know<00:02:16.799> is<00:02:16.950> poison<00:02:17.370> tip

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
again guys all we know is poison tip

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.429 
again guys all we know is poison tip
blades<00:02:17.790> are<00:02:18.000> going<00:02:18.030> to<00:02:18.239> be<00:02:18.420> a<00:02:18.450> very<00:02:18.870> crucial

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:19.439 
blades are going to be a very crucial

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:22.009 
blades are going to be a very crucial
part<00:02:19.829> of<00:02:20.099> the<00:02:20.280> rogues<00:02:20.519> damage<00:02:21.000> and<00:02:21.239> finally

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
part of the rogues damage and finally

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:23.149 
part of the rogues damage and finally
one<00:02:22.260> of<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.439> things<00:02:22.650> that<00:02:22.799> people<00:02:22.950> have<00:02:23.099> been

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:23.159 
one of the things that people have been

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:25.130 
one of the things that people have been
asking<00:02:23.579> for<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:23.909> most<00:02:24.090> is<00:02:24.359> that<00:02:24.390> it<00:02:24.569> will<00:02:24.810> make

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
asking for the most is that it will make

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.780 
asking for the most is that it will make
use<00:02:25.439> of<00:02:25.469> stealth<00:02:26.040> with<00:02:26.310> a<00:02:26.340> variety<00:02:26.519> of

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
use of stealth with a variety of

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.459 
use of stealth with a variety of
abilities<00:02:27.030> that<00:02:27.269> can<00:02:27.480> only<00:02:27.750> be<00:02:27.900> activated

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:28.469 
abilities that can only be activated

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:30.770 
abilities that can only be activated
while<00:02:28.799> the<00:02:28.950> rogue<00:02:29.159> is<00:02:29.340> in<00:02:29.549> stuff<00:02:30.060> now<00:02:30.510> this<00:02:30.659> is

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
while the rogue is in stuff now this is

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.390 
while the rogue is in stuff now this is
something<00:02:30.989> that<00:02:31.260> obviously<00:02:31.439> has<00:02:31.920> dimensions

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
something that obviously has dimensions

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.000 
something that obviously has dimensions
that<00:02:32.519> are<00:02:32.640> both<00:02:32.790> in<00:02:32.939> PvE<00:02:33.420> and<00:02:33.659> PvP<00:02:33.780> and<00:02:34.439> yoshi-p

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
that are both in PvE and PvP and yoshi-p

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.130 
that are both in PvE and PvP and yoshi-p
is<00:02:35.220> really<00:02:35.519> looking<00:02:35.819> to<00:02:35.909> flush<00:02:36.269> both<00:02:36.569> aspects

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
is really looking to flush both aspects

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.750 
is really looking to flush both aspects
of<00:02:37.260> these<00:02:37.409> out<00:02:37.620> so<00:02:37.950> I'm<00:02:38.159> very<00:02:38.489> much<00:02:38.640> looking

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
of these out so I'm very much looking

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.210 
of these out so I'm very much looking
forward<00:02:39.269> to<00:02:39.359> seeing<00:02:39.510> how<00:02:39.720> a<00:02:39.750> PvE<00:02:40.290> class<00:02:40.739> makes

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220 
forward to seeing how a PvE class makes

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.709 
forward to seeing how a PvE class makes
use<00:02:41.400> of<00:02:41.430> stealth<00:02:41.790> especially<00:02:42.329> in<00:02:42.450> long

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:42.719 
use of stealth especially in long

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 
going to be withheld until the expansion

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.330

which<00:06:07.169> they<00:06:07.530> said<00:06:07.710> they'd<00:06:07.860> like<00:06:08.010> to<00:06:08.070> do<00:06:08.250> an

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:08.340 
which they said they'd like to do an

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:10.520 
which they said they'd like to do an
expansion<00:06:08.639> every<00:06:09.150> year<00:06:09.539> and<00:06:09.720> a<00:06:09.810> half<00:06:09.990> so

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:10.530 
expansion every year and a half so

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:12.110 
expansion every year and a half so
considering<00:06:11.010> that<00:06:11.100> the<00:06:11.220> game<00:06:11.400> launched<00:06:11.970> in

considering that the game launched in
last<00:06:12.600> August<00:06:12.870> I<00:06:13.289> guess<00:06:13.650> we<00:06:13.800> can<00:06:13.919> expect

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.280
