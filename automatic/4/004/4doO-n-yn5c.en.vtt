00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
that in the title 12 update I'm not sure

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.130 
that in the title 12 update I'm not sure
if<00:00:50.100> that's<00:00:50.190> confirmed<00:00:50.550> or<00:00:50.700> not<00:00:50.730> I've<00:00:51.539> seen<00:00:51.989> it

if that's confirmed or not I've seen it

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.569 
if that's confirmed or not I've seen it
a<00:00:52.199> lot<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.440> places<00:00:52.649> so<00:00:52.949> I'm<00:00:53.010> pretty<00:00:53.190> sure<00:00:53.309> it<00:00:53.489> is

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
a lot of places so I'm pretty sure it is

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.340 
a lot of places so I'm pretty sure it is
confirmed<00:00:54.030> so<00:00:54.750> those<00:00:54.899> are<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.079> main<00:00:55.320> things

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
confirmed so those are the main things

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.860 
confirmed so those are the main things
that<00:00:55.559> are<00:00:55.739> confirmed<00:00:56.160> so<00:00:56.399> my<00:00:57.120> friend<00:00:57.420> said<00:00:57.840> he

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
that are confirmed so my friend said he

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.639 
that are confirmed so my friend said he
found<00:00:58.230> a<00:00:58.559> website<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:59.070> told<00:00:59.760> that<00:01:00.210> told<00:01:00.449> him

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
found a website that told that told him

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:02.959 
found a website that told that told him
what<00:01:01.649> could<00:01:01.770> be<00:01:01.859> in<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:01.980> title<00:01:02.219> 12<00:01:02.430> update<00:01:02.789> and

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
what could be in the title 12 update and

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.670 
what could be in the title 12 update and
then<00:01:03.629> he<00:01:03.750> told<00:01:03.899> me<00:01:04.019> that<00:01:04.140> some<00:01:04.260> of<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.439> stuff

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
then he told me that some of that stuff

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.730 
then he told me that some of that stuff
and<00:01:04.979> so<00:01:05.510> this<00:01:06.510> stuff<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:06.720> not<00:01:06.869> confirmed<00:01:07.320> this

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
and so this stuff is not confirmed this

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.640 
and so this stuff is not confirmed this
is<00:01:08.010> all<00:01:08.189> speculation<00:01:09.200> but<00:01:10.200> some<00:01:10.380> of<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.500> stuff

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
is all speculation but some of the stuff

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.010 
is all speculation but some of the stuff
that<00:01:10.680> we<00:01:10.920> might<00:01:11.280> have<00:01:11.520> in<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.909> next<00:01:12.090> update<00:01:12.180> we

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
that we might have in the next update we

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.960 
that we might have in the next update we
might<00:01:13.170> have<00:01:13.409> adventure<00:01:13.890> mode<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.310> so<00:01:14.670> for<00:01:14.909> the

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
might have adventure mode and so for the

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:15.980 
might have adventure mode and so for the
people<00:01:15.150> that<00:01:15.180> don't<00:01:15.420> know<00:01:15.479> what<00:01:15.630> adventure

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
people that don't know what adventure

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.350 
people that don't know what adventure
mode<00:01:16.140> is<00:01:16.290> adventure<00:01:17.280> mode<00:01:17.430> is<00:01:17.580> more<00:01:18.000> realistic

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
mode is adventure mode is more realistic

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.660 
mode is adventure mode is more realistic
means<00:01:19.229> you<00:01:19.830> have<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.009> go<00:01:20.250> trade<00:01:20.520> with

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
means you have to go trade with

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.370 
means you have to go trade with
villagers<00:01:20.700> here<00:01:21.299> you<00:01:21.390> go<00:01:21.479> give<00:01:21.689> them<00:01:21.840> stuff<00:01:22.080> to

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
villagers here you go give them stuff to

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.660 
villagers here you go give them stuff to
make<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.560> pickaxe<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.100> can't<00:01:23.310> just<00:01:23.430> chop<00:01:23.640> a

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
make a pickaxe you can't just chop a

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.160 
make a pickaxe you can't just chop a
tree<00:01:23.759> down<00:01:23.970> with<00:01:24.210> your<00:01:24.299> hand<00:01:24.570> you<00:01:24.810> can't<00:01:25.049> do

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
tree down with your hand you can't do

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.899 
tree down with your hand you can't do
anything<00:01:25.200> like<00:01:25.680> that<00:01:25.740> it's<00:01:26.340> basically<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.729> lot

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
anything like that it's basically a lot

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.510 
anything like that it's basically a lot
more<00:01:27.060> realistic<00:01:27.420> if<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:28.439> want<00:01:28.650> a<00:01:28.710> tool<00:01:28.920> you

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
more realistic if you want a tool you

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.490 
more realistic if you want a tool you
have<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:29.850> go<00:01:30.000> buy<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.390> or<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:30.960> have<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.140> go<00:01:31.229> make

have to go buy it or you have to go make
it<00:01:31.680> with<00:01:31.890> materials<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:32.729> you<00:01:33.150> trade<00:01:33.360> with<00:01:33.390> a

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
it with materials that you trade with a

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.499 
it with materials that you trade with a
villager<00:01:34.140> or<00:01:34.590> something<00:01:34.920> like<00:01:35.040> that<00:01:35.509> also

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
villager or something like that also

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.060 
villager or something like that also
another<00:01:36.689> speculation<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.650> lot<00:01:37.950> of<00:01:37.979> people

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
another speculation that a lot of people

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.219 
another speculation that a lot of people
have<00:01:38.759> been<00:01:38.790> worrying<00:01:39.180> about<00:01:39.240> for<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.630> long<00:01:39.780> time

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
have been worrying about for a long time

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.520 
have been worrying about for a long time
and<00:01:40.500> that<00:01:40.619> is<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.579> texture<00:01:42.210> packs<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.780> lot<00:01:43.229> of

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
and that is the texture packs a lot of

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.200 
and that is the texture packs a lot of
people<00:01:43.740> want<00:01:43.860> texture<00:01:44.159> packs<00:01:44.369> including<00:01:44.850> me<00:01:45.000> I

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
people want texture packs including me I

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.850 
people want texture packs including me I
know<00:01:45.299> I<00:01:45.659> really<00:01:45.990> want<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.200> texture<00:01:46.470> packs<00:01:46.680> in

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
know I really want the texture packs in

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.460 
know I really want the texture packs in
the<00:01:46.890> 360<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:48.479> then<00:01:48.720> if<00:01:48.899> they<00:01:49.020> do<00:01:49.079> come<00:01:49.290> into

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
the 360 and then if they do come into

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.590 
the 360 and then if they do come into
this<00:01:49.530> next<00:01:49.680> update<00:01:50.040> that<00:01:50.159> would<00:01:50.250> be<00:01:50.310> fantastic

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
this next update that would be fantastic

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.090 
this next update that would be fantastic
but<00:01:51.600> making<00:01:52.229> texture<00:01:52.500> pack<00:01:52.649> is<00:01:52.799> going<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.009> be<00:01:53.070> a

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
but making texture pack is going to be a

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.100 
but making texture pack is going to be a
lot<00:01:53.250> harder<00:01:53.490> than<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:54.360> lot<00:01:54.509> of<00:01:54.630> people<00:01:54.689> think<00:01:54.930> it

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
lot harder than a lot of people think it

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.719 
lot harder than a lot of people think it
will<00:01:55.229> be<00:01:55.350> because<00:01:55.530> of<00:01:55.740> all<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.009> encoding<00:01:56.520> or

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
will be because of all the encoding or

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.850 
will be because of all the encoding or
not<00:01:57.600> encoding<00:01:57.899> but<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.200> coating<00:01:58.500> that<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.710> do

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
not encoding but the coating that to do

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.700 
not encoding but the coating that to do
for<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.670> game<00:01:59.909> but<00:02:00.780> I<00:02:01.079> do<00:02:01.200> have<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.439> feeling

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
for the game but I do have a feeling

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:02.959 
for the game but I do have a feeling
that<00:02:01.860> if<00:02:01.890> they<00:02:02.130> do<00:02:02.189> come<00:02:02.399> out<00:02:02.520> with<00:02:02.670> texture

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
that if they do come out with texture

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.969 
that if they do come out with texture
packs<00:02:03.180> what<00:02:03.780> they're<00:02:03.899> gonna<00:02:03.990> do<00:02:04.259> is<00:02:04.500> they're

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
packs what they're gonna do is they're

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.789 
packs what they're gonna do is they're
gonna<00:02:05.340> make<00:02:05.549> it<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.790> where<00:02:05.909> we<00:02:06.810> catch<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.619> pay

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
gonna make it to where we catch a pay

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.320 
gonna make it to where we catch a pay
for<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.039> different<00:02:08.369> texture<00:02:08.640> packs<00:02:08.879> because

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
for the different texture packs because

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.910 
for the different texture packs because
they've<00:02:10.140> been<00:02:10.170> working<00:02:10.349> them<00:02:10.619> for<00:02:10.770> a<00:02:10.800> long

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
they've been working them for a long

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.040 
they've been working them for a long
time<00:02:11.220> is<00:02:11.489> what<00:02:12.090> they've<00:02:12.239> said<00:02:12.450> and<00:02:12.750> I've

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
time is what they've said and I've

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.110 
time is what they've said and I've
that<00:02:13.470> they're<00:02:14.370> probably<00:02:14.520> going<00:02:14.730> to<00:02:14.820> bring<00:02:14.970> out

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
that they're probably going to bring out

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.330 
that they're probably going to bring out
maybe<00:02:15.330> four<00:02:15.630> or<00:02:15.660> five<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:16.650> most<00:02:16.800> popular<00:02:16.980> ones

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
maybe four or five the most popular ones

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.040 
maybe four or five the most popular ones
from<00:02:17.490> the<00:02:17.610> pc<00:02:17.940> version<00:02:17.970> and<00:02:18.840> then<00:02:18.900> what

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
from the pc version and then what

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.880 
from the pc version and then what
they're<00:02:19.140> going<00:02:19.230> to<00:02:19.290> do<00:02:19.440> is<00:02:19.590> they're<00:02:19.710> going<00:02:19.740> to

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
they're going to do is they're going to

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.260 
they're going to do is they're going to
make<00:02:19.980> it<00:02:20.070> to<00:02:20.160> where<00:02:20.250> we're<00:02:20.760> gonna<00:02:20.850> have<00:02:21.000> to<00:02:21.090> pay

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
make it to where we're gonna have to pay

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.290 
make it to where we're gonna have to pay
for<00:02:21.330> them<00:02:21.600> so<00:02:22.170> you<00:02:22.530> might<00:02:22.650> have<00:02:22.710> to<00:02:22.770> pay<00:02:22.920> like

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
for them so you might have to pay like

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.810 
for them so you might have to pay like
maybe<00:02:24.300> 600<00:02:24.900> microsoft<00:02:25.290> points<00:02:25.650> for<00:02:25.890> at<00:02:26.490> extra

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
maybe 600 microsoft points for at extra

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.060 
maybe 600 microsoft points for at extra
bag<00:02:26.970> if<00:02:27.090> you<00:02:27.180> want<00:02:27.390> it<00:02:27.510> and<00:02:27.690> that<00:02:28.500> way<00:02:28.680> they'll

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
bag if you want it and that way they'll

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.710 
bag if you want it and that way they'll
probably<00:02:29.670> make<00:02:29.820> money<00:02:30.030> off<00:02:30.210> of<00:02:30.330> it<00:02:30.420> because<00:02:30.690> of

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
probably make money off of it because of

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:31.760 
probably make money off of it because of
all<00:02:30.960> the<00:02:31.110> hard<00:02:31.320> work<00:02:31.470> they've<00:02:31.620> been<00:02:31.650> doing

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
all the hard work they've been doing

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.920 
all the hard work they've been doing
which<00:02:32.310> they<00:02:32.460> definitely<00:02:32.700> observe<00:02:33.090> mean<00:02:33.900> I

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
which they definitely observe mean I

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.570 
which they definitely observe mean I
really<00:02:34.260> I<00:02:34.560> wouldn't<00:02:34.980> have<00:02:35.100> a<00:02:35.130> problem<00:02:35.400> with

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
really I wouldn't have a problem with

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.640 
really I wouldn't have a problem with
paying<00:02:35.850> 600<00:02:36.420> microsoft<00:02:36.750> points<00:02:37.140> or<00:02:37.440> however

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
paying 600 microsoft points or however

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.800 
paying 600 microsoft points or however
many<00:02:37.980> they<00:02:38.550> have<00:02:38.580> to<00:02:39.030> get<00:02:39.150> a<00:02:39.180> new<00:02:39.240> texture<00:02:39.600> pack

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
many they have to get a new texture pack

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.390 
many they have to get a new texture pack
because<00:02:40.440> I<00:02:40.620> know<00:02:40.800> it's<00:02:41.010> something<00:02:41.130> we<00:02:41.370> all

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
because I know it's something we all

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.920 
because I know it's something we all
really<00:02:41.880> want<00:02:42.150> uh<00:02:43.850> let's<00:02:44.850> see<00:02:44.910> I'm<00:02:45.330> pretty<00:02:45.660> sure

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
really want uh let's see I'm pretty sure

really want uh let's see I'm pretty sure
that's<00:02:46.140> all<00:02:46.290> I've<00:02:46.530> heard<00:02:46.920> let<00:02:47.610> me<00:02:47.700> think<00:02:48.060> what

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
that's all I've heard let me think what

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.760 
that's all I've heard let me think what
he<00:02:48.960> told<00:02:49.200> me<00:02:49.410> I'm<00:02:50.340> pretty<00:02:50.760> sure<00:02:50.970> that's<00:02:51.210> it<00:02:51.420> oh

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
we also might get the wither which is

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.150 
we also might get the wither which is
the<00:02:54.600> second<00:02:54.930> most<00:02:55.050> powerful<00:02:55.230> boss<00:02:55.680> I've<00:02:55.950> heard

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
the second most powerful boss I've heard

I've never played the pc version and so
I'm<00:02:58.740> not<00:02:58.860> exactly<00:02:59.040> sure<00:02:59.490> what<00:03:00.330> it<00:03:00.450> is<00:03:00.480> or<00:03:01.080> if

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
I'm not exactly sure what it is or if

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.140 
I'm not exactly sure what it is or if
it's<00:03:01.530> the<00:03:01.590> number<00:03:01.860> one<00:03:01.890> boss<00:03:02.220> but<00:03:02.820> I<00:03:02.880> do<00:03:02.940> know
