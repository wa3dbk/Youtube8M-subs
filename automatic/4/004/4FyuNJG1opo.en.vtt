00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.619
 I'm here again with the tone so 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:19.199
 acclaimed survival craft so well accepted and 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.270

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.580
 video that I posted on my body a lot 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.740
 people liked it so I'm bringing 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.480
 A little more for you today as you 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.630
 may have seen a title I'm talking about 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.520
 a little about textures exactly here 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.100
 hit a flat game I'm showing a 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.510
 bit of the game for you and you 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:42.180
 they can then compare with the texture ok 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:47.610
 So this is the one that is the smooth game that by 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:50.640
 while I'll put a texture and 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.870
 I'll show you what I had to 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.340
 I returned 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.780
 this one is a texture that they call 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.520
 in hd it improves slightly to the image 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.789
 blocks how you can be 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:06.570
 seeing there is not much that changes there 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.100
 but you can only see that he leaves the blocks 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.850
 more right 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.710
 It's because I'm showing it's texture. 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.350
 because you had an update one time 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.210
 and it was much easier to download 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.320
 textures and everything else for us has changed a 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.180
 Little things here then, then. 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.900
 it was much easier to download texture and 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.939
 everything else 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.259
 That's why I'm showing you these 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:33.150
 issues that you recorded here old 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:36.990
 all the textures that show who I 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:39.210
 I'm going to leave one year crazy child every 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.670
 textures I show here I go 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.369
 leave their names for download by 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.780
 world I will not let her name leave 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:49.460
 because I'll explain to you how it is 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:52.380
 that you download for you to download in a 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:55.049
 Your handset okay I'll show you more 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.880
 an equation a little bit ready 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.710
 is a texture that leaves the items 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.619
 little more like these from maine 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.689
 craft pick that peace has not changed but 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.250
 you can see that the torch has changed 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.099
 the torch resembling the show of the greatest 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.130
 The pumpkin also did not change the 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:14.210
 Similar door when michael
