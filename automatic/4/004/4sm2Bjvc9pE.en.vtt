00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
everybody is indeed on nine chemistry as

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.960 
everybody is indeed on nine chemistry as
that<00:01:18.930> is<00:01:19.170> what<00:01:19.409> it<00:01:19.560> takes<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:20.070> be<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.250> perfect

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
that is what it takes to be a perfect

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.429 
that is what it takes to be a perfect
hybrid<00:01:21.210> in<00:01:21.659> my<00:01:22.200> most<00:01:22.470> humble<00:01:22.799> estava<00:01:23.340> pinions

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
hybrid in my most humble estava pinions

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:28.819 
hybrid in my most humble estava pinions
we<00:01:25.439> eventually<00:01:25.890> do<00:01:26.640> find<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.090> match<00:01:27.270> here<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.829> I

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
we eventually do find a match here and I

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.710 
we eventually do find a match here and I
can't<00:01:29.340> remember<00:01:29.700> what<00:01:30.030> round<00:01:30.329> we<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:30.540> think

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
can't remember what round we I think

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.060 
can't remember what round we I think
we'd<00:01:30.930> actually<00:01:31.049> just<00:01:31.470> enter<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.860> tournament

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
we'd actually just enter the tournament

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.170 
we'd actually just enter the tournament
so<00:01:32.340> this<00:01:32.490> is<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.670> first<00:01:32.880> round<00:01:33.030> of<00:01:33.119> the

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
so this is the first round of the

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.580 
so this is the first round of the
tournament<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.630> actually<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.170> looks<00:01:34.380> like

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
tournament and actually it looks like

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.890 
tournament and actually it looks like
not<00:01:34.950> everybody's<00:01:35.520> on<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:36.240> nine<00:01:36.509> chemistry

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
not everybody's on the nine chemistry

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.780 
not everybody's on the nine chemistry
that<00:01:36.990> I<00:01:37.049> was<00:01:37.140> talking<00:01:37.229> about<00:01:37.439> as<00:01:37.680> i<00:01:37.799> was<00:01:37.920> at<00:01:38.070> 97

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
that's partly my style i will take

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.969 
that's partly my style i will take
chances<00:04:23.789> and<00:04:23.849> go<00:04:24.090> for<00:04:24.330> the<00:04:24.360> I<00:04:25.050> guess<00:04:25.470> the<00:04:25.500> semi

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
chances and go for the I guess the semi

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:26.640 
chances and go for the I guess the semi
risk

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
risk

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.060 
risk
he<00:04:26.740> well<00:04:27.580> not<00:04:27.699> semi<00:04:28.000> risky<00:04:28.419> but<00:04:28.630> I<00:04:28.690> I<00:04:29.560> don't

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
he well not semi risky but I I don't

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.400 
he well not semi risky but I I don't
know<00:04:30.190> the<00:04:30.430> the<00:04:30.820> montage<00:04:31.270> goal<00:04:31.630> per<00:04:31.900> se<00:04:32.110> but<00:04:32.169> my

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
know the the montage goal per se but my

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.290 
know the the montage goal per se but my
time<00:04:32.590> as<00:04:33.009> you<00:04:33.190> guys<00:04:33.220> know<00:04:33.370> my<00:04:33.669> style<00:04:33.880> tends<00:04:34.150> to

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
time as you guys know my style tends to

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.420 
time as you guys know my style tends to
be<00:04:34.389> quick<00:04:34.750> passing<00:04:35.229> and<00:04:35.530> beating<00:04:36.009> getting<00:04:36.340> in

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
be quick passing and beating getting in

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.100 
be quick passing and beating getting in
behind<00:04:36.550> defenses<00:04:37.180> which<00:04:37.360> doesn't<00:04:37.900> lead<00:04:38.080> to

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
behind defenses which doesn't lead to

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.860 
behind defenses which doesn't lead to
the<00:04:38.410> the<00:04:39.310> most<00:04:39.520> beautiful<00:04:40.150> school<00:04:40.479> gold

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
the the most beautiful school gold

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.120 
the the most beautiful school gold
scored<00:04:41.199> but<00:04:41.320> he<00:04:41.440> actually<00:04:41.590> brings<00:04:41.949> us<00:04:42.100> back

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
scored but he actually brings us back

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.360 
scored but he actually brings us back
level<00:04:43.000> I<00:04:43.180> think<00:04:43.210> eventually<00:04:43.570> 22<00:04:44.470> but<00:04:44.800> for

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
level I think eventually 22 but for

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:46.770 
level I think eventually 22 but for
whatever<00:04:45.520> reason<00:04:45.669> decides<00:04:46.240> to<00:04:46.419> back<00:04:46.539> out

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
whatever reason decides to back out

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.830 
whatever reason decides to back out
eventually<00:04:47.020> and<00:04:47.759> we'll<00:04:48.759> take<00:04:48.910> the<00:04:49.030> win<00:04:49.060> I'm

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
eventually and we'll take the win I'm

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.540 
eventually and we'll take the win I'm
not<00:04:50.169> going<00:04:50.350> to<00:04:50.410> complain<00:04:50.590> about<00:04:50.800> it<00:04:50.919> he<00:04:51.370> backed

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
not going to complain about it he backed
