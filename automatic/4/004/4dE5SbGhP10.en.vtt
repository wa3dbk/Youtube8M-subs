not<00:02:41.780> coachable<00:02:42.260> and<00:02:42.590> ain't<00:02:43.520> nobody<00:02:43.610> out<00:02:43.970> here

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
not coachable and ain't nobody out here

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.380 
not coachable and ain't nobody out here
no<00:02:44.239> coach<00:02:44.510> but<00:02:44.810> when<00:02:45.110> he<00:02:45.260> does<00:02:45.470> something<00:02:45.860> bad

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
no coach but when he does something bad

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:52.180 
no coach but when he does something bad
is<00:02:47.390> never<00:02:48.110> his<00:02:48.290> fault<00:02:48.320> and<00:02:48.830> he<00:02:50.440> can<00:02:51.440> he<00:02:51.920> turn

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190

over the ball a little more than
everybody<00:02:55.550> else<00:02:56.000> so<00:02:56.530> that's<00:02:57.530> why<00:02:57.709> you<00:02:57.770> were

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
everybody else so that's why you were
