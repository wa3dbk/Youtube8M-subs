00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:15.980 
marking functionality here as in other
parts<00:06:14.370> of<00:06:14.580> the<00:06:15.030> phone<00:06:15.240> such<00:06:15.630> as<00:06:15.780> in<00:06:15.930> the

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:15.990 
parts of the phone such as in the

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:18.830 
parts of the phone such as in the
gallery<00:06:16.669> I'll<00:06:17.669> just<00:06:17.909> briefly<00:06:18.090> show<00:06:18.449> you<00:06:18.479> here

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 
gallery I'll just briefly show you here

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:24.710 
gallery I'll just briefly show you here
if<00:06:19.590> I<00:06:19.740> go<00:06:19.949> into<00:06:20.430> the<00:06:21.030> gallery<00:06:23.389> and<00:06:24.389> so<00:06:24.570> my

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:24.720 
if I go into the gallery and so my

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.040 
if I go into the gallery and so my
videos<00:06:25.259> are<00:06:25.530> similar<00:06:25.919> and<00:06:26.840> I'd<00:06:27.840> like<00:06:27.990> to

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.050 
videos are similar and I'd like to

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:32.839 
videos are similar and I'd like to
select<00:06:28.409> delete<00:06:28.789> then<00:06:29.789> I<00:06:29.909> can<00:06:30.060> mark<00:06:30.270> a<00:06:31.849> number

00:06:32.839 --> 00:06:32.849 
select delete then I can mark a number

00:06:32.849 --> 00:06:35.390 
select delete then I can mark a number
of<00:06:32.909> items<00:06:33.030> to<00:06:33.419> delete<00:06:33.659> and<00:06:33.930> I<00:06:34.860> can<00:06:35.009> actually<00:06:35.310> do

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:35.400 
of items to delete and I can actually do

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:39.170 
of items to delete and I can actually do
the<00:06:35.550> same<00:06:35.699> thing<00:06:36.000> when<00:06:36.270> I<00:06:36.300> delete<00:06:36.630> a<00:06:36.690> draft<00:06:38.180> so

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:39.180 
the same thing when I delete a draft so

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:42.860 
the same thing when I delete a draft so
I<00:06:39.860> would<00:06:40.860> prefer<00:06:41.039> that<00:06:41.789> this<00:06:42.000> phone<00:06:42.240> had<00:06:42.510> the

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:42.870 
I would prefer that this phone had the

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:43.150 
I would prefer that this phone had the
same

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:43.160 
same

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.280 
same
deletion<00:06:43.670> functionality<00:06:44.390> in<00:06:44.780> every

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:45.290 
deletion functionality in every

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:47.710 
deletion functionality in every
application<00:06:45.820> the<00:06:46.820> injection<00:06:47.300> will<00:06:47.420> then<00:06:47.600> be

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:47.720 
application the injection will then be

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.450 
application the injection will then be
easier<00:06:47.990> for<00:06:48.020> me<00:06:48.200> to<00:06:48.290> learn<00:06:48.620> because<00:06:48.890> I<00:06:49.310> can

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:49.460 
easier for me to learn because I can

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:53.250 
easier for me to learn because I can
reduce<00:06:49.880> my<00:06:49.910> knowledge<00:06:50.450> based<00:06:51.260> on<00:06:51.440> consistency

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:53.260 
reduce my knowledge based on consistency

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:58.120 
reduce my knowledge based on consistency
so<00:06:54.400> overall<00:06:56.020> the<00:06:57.020> many<00:06:57.170> find<00:06:57.410> solutions<00:06:57.950> in

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:58.130 
so overall the many find solutions in

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:00.790 
so overall the many find solutions in
the<00:06:58.430> text<00:06:59.090> messaging<00:06:59.450> application<00:06:59.990> put<00:07:00.650> some

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:00.800 
the text messaging application put some

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:03.430 
the text messaging application put some
flaws<00:07:01.010> as<00:07:01.220> well
