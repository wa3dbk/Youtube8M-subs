i also use it for if I'm like getting

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.809 
i also use it for if I'm like getting
bored<00:02:16.140> of<00:02:16.350> my<00:02:16.620> other<00:02:16.740> classes<00:02:17.040> or<00:02:17.459> whatever

it's<00:02:18.090> really<00:02:18.450> nice<00:02:18.569> gun<00:02:18.870> using<00:02:19.380> the<00:02:19.500> standard

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
it's really nice gun using the standard

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.570 
it's really nice gun using the standard
extended<00:02:20.640> mag<00:02:20.790> stock<00:02:21.150> and<00:02:21.330> suppressor<00:02:21.780> game

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
extended mag stock and suppressor game

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.800 
extended mag stock and suppressor game
then<00:02:23.580> the<00:02:23.700> super-soldier<00:02:24.150> game<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.600> only

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
then the super-soldier game the only

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.540 
then the super-soldier game the only
difference<00:02:25.110> with<00:02:25.230> this<00:02:25.380> one<00:02:25.650> is<00:02:25.980> that<00:02:26.250> I<00:02:26.280> use

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
difference with this one is that I use

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.170 
difference with this one is that I use
flak<00:02:26.940> jacket<00:02:27.420> instead<00:02:27.810> of<00:02:28.020> ghosts<00:02:28.680> and<00:02:29.150> then<00:02:30.150> i

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
flak jacket instead of ghosts and then i

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.540 
flak jacket instead of ghosts and then i
use<00:02:30.390> my<00:02:30.540> submachine<00:02:30.990> gun<00:02:31.170> class<00:02:31.490> where<00:02:32.490> I'm

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
use my submachine gun class where I'm

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.780 
use my submachine gun class where I'm
using<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:32.880> MSMC<00:02:33.560> with<00:02:34.560> extended<00:02:35.010> mags<00:02:35.040> a

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
using the MSMC with extended mags a

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.680 
using the MSMC with extended mags a
quick<00:02:36.300> draw<00:02:36.980> long<00:02:37.980> barrel<00:02:38.250> and<00:02:38.640> then<00:02:39.600> i'm

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
quick draw long barrel and then i'm

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.840 
quick draw long barrel and then i'm
using<00:02:39.810> hardline<00:02:40.500> and<00:02:40.739> ghost<00:02:40.980> oh<00:02:41.310> by<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:41.760> way

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
using hardline and ghost oh by the way

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.310 
using hardline and ghost oh by the way
reason<00:02:42.270> i'm<00:02:42.330> using<00:02:42.540> long<00:02:42.690> vowels<00:02:43.050> it<00:02:43.170> just

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
reason i'm using long vowels it just

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.600 
reason i'm using long vowels it just
makes<00:02:43.500> it<00:02:43.620> as<00:02:43.739> good<00:02:43.920> as<00:02:44.070> an<00:02:44.160> assault<00:02:44.520> rifle

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
makes it as good as an assault rifle

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.090 
makes it as good as an assault rifle
pretty<00:02:45.269> much<00:02:45.480> like<00:02:45.690> most<00:02:46.170> assault<00:02:46.560> rifles<00:02:46.950> at

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
pretty much like most assault rifles at

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.460 
pretty much like most assault rifles at
range<00:02:47.340> it's<00:02:48.180> a<00:02:48.239> really<00:02:48.450> really<00:02:48.870> good<00:02:49.080> gun<00:02:49.320> the

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
range it's a really really good gun the

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.350 
range it's a really really good gun the
MSMC<00:02:49.890> one<00:02:50.280> of<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:50.430> best<00:02:50.640> some<00:02:50.850> singer<00:02:51.209> than

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
MSMC one of the best some singer than

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.270 
MSMC one of the best some singer than
the<00:02:51.450> game<00:02:51.600> in<00:02:51.750> my<00:02:51.870> opinion<00:02:51.900> and<00:02:52.380> I'm<00:02:52.980> using<00:02:53.160> the

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
the game in my opinion and I'm using the

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.890 
the game in my opinion and I'm using the
hardline<00:02:53.670> and<00:02:53.880> go<00:02:54.000> so<00:02:54.209> I<00:02:54.239> can<00:02:54.330> flank<00:02:54.630> round

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
hardline and go so I can flank round

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.009 
hardline and go so I can flank round
under<00:02:55.350> standard<00:02:55.680> scavenger<00:02:56.190> and<00:02:56.220> dexterity

under standard scavenger and dexterity

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:01.400 
under standard scavenger and dexterity
but<00:02:58.019> anyway<00:02:58.610> that's<00:02:59.610> my<00:02:59.670> classes<00:03:00.269> so<00:03:00.630> I'm<00:03:00.959> like

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
but anyway that's my classes so I'm like

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.320 
but anyway that's my classes so I'm like
