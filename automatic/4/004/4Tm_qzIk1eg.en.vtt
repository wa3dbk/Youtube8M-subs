former One race and why it's happening
associate<00:01:59.399> I<00:01:59.549> really<00:01:59.969> don't<00:02:00.210> know<00:02:00.420> that's

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
associate I really don't know that's

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.929 
associate I really don't know that's
obviously<00:02:00.960> it's<00:02:01.380> you<00:02:01.890> know<00:02:01.950> money<00:02:02.369> normally

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
obviously it's you know money normally

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.060 
obviously it's you know money normally
is<00:02:03.060> is<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.780> key<00:02:03.960> factor<00:02:04.439> in<00:02:04.590> why<00:02:04.770> things

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
is is the key factor in why things

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.530 
is is the key factor in why things
happen<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:05.490> why<00:02:05.549> they<00:02:05.700> don't<00:02:05.909> happen<00:02:06.090> so<00:02:06.420> I'm

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
happen and why they don't happen so I'm

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.169 
happen and why they don't happen so I'm
sure<00:02:06.750> it<00:02:06.960> is<00:02:07.590> in<00:02:07.710> this<00:02:07.829> case<00:02:08.039> whenever<00:02:08.759> I<00:02:08.970> go<00:02:09.149> to

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
sure it is in this case whenever I go to

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.330 
sure it is in this case whenever I go to
races<00:02:09.569> there<00:02:09.750> are<00:02:09.810> other<00:02:10.069> monochrome<00:02:11.069> places

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
races there are other monochrome places

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.020 
races there are other monochrome places
the<00:02:11.400> gap<00:02:11.550> there<00:02:11.700> definitely<00:02:11.879> is<00:02:12.209> a<00:02:12.239> lot<00:02:12.450> of

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
the gap there definitely is a lot of

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.229 
the gap there definitely is a lot of
so<00:02:14.030> there<00:02:14.569> is<00:02:14.629> maybe<00:02:15.170> a<00:02:15.470> little<00:02:15.530> bit<00:02:15.950> under

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
so there is maybe a little bit under

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.130 
so there is maybe a little bit under
underground<00:02:17.239> and<00:02:17.540> Russia<00:02:17.720> at<00:02:17.870> the<00:02:17.900> minute

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
underground and Russia at the minute

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.330 
underground and Russia at the minute
because<00:02:18.349> there<00:02:18.470> is<00:02:18.560> no<00:02:18.680> race<00:02:18.890> but<00:02:19.099> you've<00:02:19.189> got
