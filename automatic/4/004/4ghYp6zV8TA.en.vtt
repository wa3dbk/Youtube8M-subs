of the wines that had been made from
this<00:01:21.450> property<00:01:21.990> but<00:01:22.890> I<00:01:23.100> was<00:01:23.430> really<00:01:23.850> anxious

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
this property but I was really anxious

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.300 
this property but I was really anxious
to<00:01:24.450> get<00:01:24.630> my<00:01:25.080> own<00:01:25.259> hands<00:01:25.470> in<00:01:25.650> the<00:01:25.710> soil<00:01:25.890> up<00:01:26.100> here

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
to get my own hands in the soil up here

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.920 
to get my own hands in the soil up here
and<00:01:26.520> see<00:01:26.790> what<00:01:26.939> I<00:01:26.970> could<00:01:27.180> do<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.360> push<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:27.869> even

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
and see what I could do to push it even

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.140 
and see what I could do to push it even
further<00:01:28.110> so<00:01:28.829> we<00:01:28.950> can<00:01:29.100> walk<00:01:29.520> down<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.729> venue<00:01:29.970> and

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
further so we can walk down to venue and

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.550 
further so we can walk down to venue and
take<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.299> look<00:01:30.509> at<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.720> grapes<00:01:30.930> we<00:01:31.500> were

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
take a look at the grapes we were

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.630 
take a look at the grapes we were
probably<00:01:31.829> getting<00:01:32.009> ready<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.460> start

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
probably getting ready to start

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.390 
probably getting ready to start
harvesting<00:01:32.880> next<00:01:33.420> week<00:01:34.040> it's<00:01:35.040> a<00:01:35.189> situation

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
harvesting next week it's a situation

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.289 
harvesting next week it's a situation
again<00:01:35.790> where<00:01:36.090> we're<00:01:36.329> really<00:01:36.750> really<00:01:37.110> close

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
again where we're really really close

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:40.670 
again where we're really really close
but<00:01:39.299> as<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:39.630> can<00:01:39.750> see<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.290> weather<00:01:40.530> is

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
but as you can see the weather is

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.100 
but as you can see the weather is
closing<00:01:40.890> in<00:01:41.220> on<00:01:41.280> us<00:01:41.490> so<00:01:41.790> as<00:01:42.060> usually<00:01:42.750> happens

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
closing in on us so as usually happens

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.560

in<00:01:43.229> Oregon<00:01:43.590> it's<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.700> very<00:01:44.939> fine<00:01:45.149> line<00:01:45.360> between

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
in Oregon it's a very fine line between

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.260 
in Oregon it's a very fine line between
how<00:01:46.320> we<00:01:46.380> get<00:01:46.740> things<00:01:46.950> completely<00:01:47.939> and

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
how we get things completely and

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.560 
how we get things completely and
perfectly<00:01:48.390> ripe<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:48.960> how<00:01:49.290> we<00:01:49.850> weather<00:01:50.850> the

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
perfectly ripe and how we weather the

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.600 
perfectly ripe and how we weather the
storms<00:01:52.079> that<00:01:52.350> are<00:01:52.500> bound<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:53.040> come<00:01:53.280> at<00:01:53.430> some

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
storms that are bound to come at some

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
point in the fall when we came into this

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.429 
point in the fall when we came into this
vineyard<00:02:01.009> we<00:02:02.009> kept<00:02:02.280> asking<00:02:02.990> everyone<00:02:03.990> that

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
vineyard we kept asking everyone that

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.109 
vineyard we kept asking everyone that
had<00:02:04.590> been<00:02:04.740> here<00:02:04.920> before<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.670> vineyard

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
had been here before the vineyard

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.219 
had been here before the vineyard
manager<00:02:06.509> who<00:02:06.689> worked<00:02:06.899> here<00:02:07.020> from<00:02:07.170> the

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
manager who worked here from the

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.169 
manager who worked here from the
beginning<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:08.190> former<00:02:08.640> owners<00:02:09.000> of<00:02:09.119> the

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
beginning the former owners of the

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.440 
beginning the former owners of the
property<00:02:10.400> when<00:02:11.400> did<00:02:11.640> you<00:02:11.790> plant<00:02:12.090> this<00:02:12.270> and

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
property when did you plant this and

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.880 
property when did you plant this and
they<00:02:12.510> kept<00:02:12.660> saying<00:02:12.930> this<00:02:13.200> block<00:02:13.500> was

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
they kept saying this block was

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.690 
they kept saying this block was
in<00:02:14.280> 1989<00:02:15.150> but<00:02:15.960> looking<00:02:16.290> at<00:02:16.410> these<00:02:16.530> vines<00:02:16.830> they

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
in 1989 but looking at these vines they

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.360 
in 1989 but looking at these vines they
don't<00:02:17.940> look<00:02:18.120> anything<00:02:18.750> like<00:02:19.070> 20<00:02:20.070> year<00:02:20.190> old

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
don't look anything like 20 year old

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.630 
don't look anything like 20 year old
vines<00:02:21.710> normally<00:02:22.710> when<00:02:22.890> you<00:02:23.040> see<00:02:23.070> if<00:02:23.400> on<00:02:23.520> the

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
vines normally when you see if on the

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.490 
vines normally when you see if on the
stone<00:02:23.790> years<00:02:23.970> old<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.180> trunk<00:02:24.420> is<00:02:24.570> maybe<00:02:24.810> this

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
stone years old the trunk is maybe this

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.580 
stone years old the trunk is maybe this
big<00:02:25.770> around<00:02:26.690> but<00:02:27.690> everything<00:02:28.410> in<00:02:28.500> the

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
big around but everything in the

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.230 
big around but everything in the
vineyard<00:02:28.890> was<00:02:29.520> very<00:02:30.060> very<00:02:30.510> stunted<00:02:31.820> in<00:02:32.820> some

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
vineyard was very very stunted in some

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.050 
vineyard was very very stunted in some
ways<00:02:33.420> that<00:02:33.720> could<00:02:33.840> be<00:02:34.020> a<00:02:34.050> really<00:02:34.470> big<00:02:34.590> problem

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
ways that could be a really big problem

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.240 
ways that could be a really big problem
but<00:02:36.060> luckily<00:02:36.390> for<00:02:36.570> us<00:02:36.870> sort<00:02:37.410> of<00:02:37.530> everything<00:02:38.040> in

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
but luckily for us sort of everything in

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.940 
but luckily for us sort of everything in
the<00:02:38.340> vineyard<00:02:38.610> was<00:02:38.790> stunted<00:02:39.510> in<00:02:39.870> balance<00:02:40.410> what

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
the vineyard was stunted in balance what

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.560 
the vineyard was stunted in balance what
we<00:02:40.980> found<00:02:41.310> was<00:02:41.580> that<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:41.850> vines<00:02:42.030> themselves

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
we found was that the vines themselves

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.440 
we found was that the vines themselves
were<00:02:42.750> planted<00:02:43.290> on<00:02:43.470> there's<00:02:44.130> about<00:02:44.370> 18<00:02:44.760> -<00:02:44.910> 10<00:02:45.300> to

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
were planted on there's about 18 - 10 to

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.270 
were planted on there's about 18 - 10 to
18<00:02:45.690> inches<00:02:45.900> of<00:02:45.960> topsoil<00:02:46.260> and<00:02:46.680> then<00:02:46.830> below<00:02:47.100> that

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
18 inches of topsoil and then below that

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.670 
18 inches of topsoil and then below that
is<00:02:47.490> nothing<00:02:47.820> but<00:02:48.030> parent<00:02:48.600> rock<00:02:48.780> and<00:02:49.080> so<00:02:49.530> the

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
is nothing but parent rock and so the

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.810 
is nothing but parent rock and so the
mines<00:02:49.830> themselves<00:02:50.010> have<00:02:50.400> had<00:02:50.520> to<00:02:50.610> struggle

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
mines themselves have had to struggle

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.240 
mines themselves have had to struggle
extremely<00:02:51.780> hard<00:02:52.050> just<00:02:52.890> to<00:02:53.070> establish

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
extremely hard just to establish

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.180 
extremely hard just to establish
themselves<00:02:54.150> and<00:02:54.360> so<00:02:54.720> well<00:02:55.380> you<00:02:55.709> would<00:02:55.950> usually

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
themselves and so well you would usually

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.920 
themselves and so well you would usually
see<00:02:56.400> a<00:02:56.610> vine<00:02:56.880> much<00:02:57.120> bigger<00:02:57.420> with<00:02:57.660> a<00:02:57.690> bigger

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
see a vine much bigger with a bigger

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.280 
see a vine much bigger with a bigger
canopy<00:02:58.440> and<00:02:58.650> greater<00:02:58.980> fruit<00:02:59.250> set<00:02:59.490> we<00:03:00.330> get<00:03:00.600> tiny

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
canopy and greater fruit set we get tiny

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.380 
canopy and greater fruit set we get tiny
tiny<00:03:01.680> clusters<00:03:02.160> with<00:03:02.400> very<00:03:02.670> small<00:03:03.000> berries

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
tiny clusters with very small berries

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.090 
tiny clusters with very small berries
and<00:03:03.600> very<00:03:03.810> little<00:03:04.050> fruit<00:03:04.380> set<00:03:04.620> on<00:03:04.800> the<00:03:04.920> vine

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
and very little fruit set on the vine

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.970 
and very little fruit set on the vine
which<00:03:05.940> as<00:03:06.150> you<00:03:06.300> know<00:03:06.330> a<00:03:06.830> hard-working<00:03:07.830> vine

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
which as you know a hard-working vine

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.730 
which as you know a hard-working vine
with<00:03:08.459> very<00:03:08.790> low<00:03:09.030> yields<00:03:09.390> is<00:03:09.510> always<00:03:10.290> going<00:03:10.590> to

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
with very low yields is always going to

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.820 
with very low yields is always going to
produce<00:03:11.090> fruit<00:03:12.090> that<00:03:12.120> is<00:03:12.600> more<00:03:13.350> expressive

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
produce fruit that is more expressive

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.229 
produce fruit that is more expressive
more<00:03:14.340> concentrated<00:03:15.090> and<00:03:15.300> more<00:03:16.200> distinctive

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
more concentrated and more distinctive

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.550 
more concentrated and more distinctive
that<00:03:18.239> is<00:03:18.420> for<00:03:18.600> me<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:18.900> most<00:03:18.959> exciting<00:03:19.440> thing

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
that is for me the most exciting thing

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.080 
that is for me the most exciting thing
about<00:03:19.650> being<00:03:19.800> able<00:03:20.100> to<00:03:20.250> work<00:03:20.430> this<00:03:20.580> project<00:03:21.000> is

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
about being able to work this project is

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.690 
about being able to work this project is
that<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.239> fruit<00:03:21.570> itself<00:03:21.750> is<00:03:22.260> so<00:03:23.100> distinctive

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
that the fruit itself is so distinctive

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.390 
that the fruit itself is so distinctive
the<00:03:24.470> original<00:03:25.470> property<00:03:25.830> is<00:03:25.890> six<00:03:26.070> acres<00:03:26.370> that

what I do think about this site is not
that<00:05:00.550> it's<00:05:00.699> the<00:05:00.759> best<00:05:01.120> place<00:05:01.389> to<00:05:01.419> grow<00:05:01.659> Pinot

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
that it's the best place to grow Pinot

00:05:03.959 --> 00:05:03.969 
Noir I'm trying to make it that but it

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:08.040 
Noir I'm trying to make it that but it
is<00:05:04.090> extremely<00:05:04.560> distinctive<00:05:06.449> in<00:05:07.449> just<00:05:07.900> the
