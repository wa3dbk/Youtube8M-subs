00:00:52.033 --> 00:00:55.147
 Here I have prepared the same speech of a01~a05 and another film of b01, b02 

00:00:56.033 --> 00:00:59.838
 First pull the first film of the first speech of a01 to the background. 

00:00:59.838 --> 00:01:05.480
 Resize at the same time to create the first menu button 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:14.977

00:01:14.977 --> 00:01:18.069
 Right click on the a01 below and select [Properties] 

00:01:18.669 --> 00:01:24.521
 In the [Post-comandos] below, set which video in the [File Cabinet] is to be broadcasted in this video. 

00:01:24.521 --> 00:01:28.770
 Here we hope to broadcast the a02 movie, so we have to choose [jump title 2] which is the second video. 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:38.638
 Set the second video to broadcast the third video 

00:01:38.638 --> 00:01:47.810
 Set the third video to broadcast the fourth video 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:59.050
 Set the fourth video to be broadcast after the fourth video is broadcast. 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.390
 The fifth paragraph is different because there is no film behind him. 

00:02:02.392 --> 00:02:07.850
 So we have to set the menu to broadcast the DVD when it is finished, so we choose [ jump vmgm menu 1] 

00:02:09.333 --> 00:02:11.870
 Next we are going to add the second speech to the DVD menu. 

00:02:11.866 --> 00:02:16.810

00:02:16.812 --> 00:02:21.970
 Then we will pull the second film b02 of the second speech to the [File Cabinet] below. 

00:02:21.967 --> 00:02:28.600
 Again, let's set the movie 6 (that is, b01) to broadcast which movie to broadcast. 

00:02:28.705 --> 00:02:35.740
 Here we choose the seventh film 

00:02:36.033 --> 00:02:44.400
 Then we set the b02 movie to broadcast the DVD menu after the broadcast. 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.680
