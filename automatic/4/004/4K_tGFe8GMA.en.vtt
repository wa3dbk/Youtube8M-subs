00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.990
 new wives by the way told about him 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.429
 first in the world this is acer aspire r7 on 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.039
 actually have calls him more 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.890
 just r7 for sparta less well no shorter 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.660
 important it is from pairs r7 what is the main feature 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.220
 This apparatus many of you already know 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.960
 many have already bought it 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.010
 only sold recently 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.220
 went on sale 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.650
 this is his super hinge mechanism 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.739
 in English, hinge is called ayzel 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.380
 hinge that is shorter and hinge is the hinge 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.170
 this thing is the construction itself 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.020
 patented and guys known 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.629
 called evil 4 letters what is it 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.670
 feature and sire insist on so 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.910
 called the gauge with move us only 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.489
 He insists that suffered a touchpad that's where 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.289
 many of you have already seen it now we 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.030
 talk about the serial version that is 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.129
 This is a machine that is right here from 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.739
 store here please cyrillic on 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.809
 keyboard Russian letters are all there and not 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.570
 very different from what you are 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.330
 see under the brand of the USSR in stores from 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.860
 habitual keys of island type 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.770
 here is not the way saved branch naturally 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.470
 here is 8 Windows and what is this method 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.869
 that this device is able to his first 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.670
 Carrying opportunities this job is just 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.820
 as a laptop so to speak here a little bit 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.530
 sit work print we learn by 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.799
 new use touchpad and so on 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.930
 the second form is the second activity for 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.530
 This apparatus is the so-called format 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.840
 aizel 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.500
 This is brand name beads Scythian arma 3 2 so you 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.420
 look move to yourself and press 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.340
 and the angle can be changed completely 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.920
 do it differently sorry what 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.439
 the table is now considered furniture at all 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.750
 useless in short from me 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.790
 the only thing that confuses in this format 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.380
 it's naturally the mechanism itself because 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.180
 the guys here say it's super 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.159
 robust design can be fixed 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.390
 from any angle and everything will be fine but 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.460
 on the other hand when icons 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.479
 located at the bottom of the forest all 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.420
 up above naturally 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.180
 hard monitor will be more and yes here 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.220
 after all he 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:10.360
 turns on the other hand missing 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.770
 easy pressing and everything is pressed and when 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.500
 this screen remains in place 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:18.820
 I want to believe that not so much pain 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:22.000
 for asus to them as well for the air not to 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.740
 just fine and the gadget worked long 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.310
 years happy to be your hosts can do here 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:29.320
 so then the touchpad is not visible at all 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.330
 same typing means 2 and 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:34.570
 aizel called the third format this 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:37.209
 tablet format what does the screen have to do with 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.650
 fits completely to the bottom of it 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:42.640
 slightly elevated work with him 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:45.130
 a little more convenient 4 format this format is 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.920
 format forgot what it's called in my 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.380
 presentation well, it doesnâ€™t look like it 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.230
 so that is, you sit type for your 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.630
 aizel he find and opposite you partner 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.320
 and you im so sushi bratyun for dawn here 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.810
 both 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:02.650
 He is so there nishtyak and now read back 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:06.760
 and you again autoturn again all 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:09.310
 ok the gadget is made in places from 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.860
 aluminum in places of plastic weighs 24 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.440
 kilogram but it is 15 and 6 inches therefore 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.630
 in general, up weight, I think is normal 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.680
 decent although easy to hold in one hand 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:22.980
 and nothing falls 15 and 6 inches 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.750
 screen diagonal of 1920 to 1080 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.750
 supports and 10 simultaneously touch 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.700
 if you have children and they all love 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.610
 together poke in 1 monitor this 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.470
 the monitor will understand everything else that big 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.540
 The touchpad is quite comfortable but natural to 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.160
 he needs to get used to 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.510
 guys are here early to bet that 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.150
 it would be better to use more 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.459
 screen and touchpad how would he have here 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.930
 two reasons because many all 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.519
 never accustomed to it 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.450
 this format and one way or another will 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:51.790
 reach for the touchpad 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.620
 and secondly just stupidly needed 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.780
 do something here because if 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.850
 was not here. yes but that would be 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:02.079
 some strange empty silver 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:04.570
 panel port and a lot of ports because 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:04.930
 the gadget is pretty thick on this side 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:08.260
 us 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.040
 sd card and the dynamic is port usb and 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.170
 the regular 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.760
 and volume when you work with 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.500
 device mode tablet honestly 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.269
 keep it in your hands and use 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.500
 im like a tablet in the hands of natural 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.940
 very comfortable and so temporary 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.289
 enjoy easier still in place 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.449
 Us thick more screen bear 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:25.479
 rises when he turns it over 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:28.360
 charging socket power button protective 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:31.000
 Kensington lock nexen has 2 ports yusb 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.210
 30 again speaker headphone jack 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.759
 hdmi and displayport 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:38.680
 over stuffing this is such a pretty 

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:40.960
 premium gadget natural and serovskiy 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.030
 although here it is written about 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.530
 initially spoke with action processors 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.449
 core i5 core i7 naturally 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.120
 ssd-drives 4 generation processors 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:53.020
 intel stuffing standard for 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:55.750
 all gadgets Davy 2 Patent and 14 years 8 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:59.530
 gigabyte of RAM and discrete graphics 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:02.169
 Jiti 750m looked in steam daw because 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:04.419
 that you always don't remember everything 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:06.820
 complete and complete we have 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:08.500
 a special place where everything hides in 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:12.639
 There is a mouse here 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:16.330
 wireless with such bulges in 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:19.690
 finger cavities simple 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.979
 plastic but it works and just like 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.810
 not even packed 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:25.199
 unpack two adapters this 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:29.289
 displayport on widget 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:31.000
 close-up will not spoil anyone 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:34.449
 them raspberries will leave there so packed 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:37.419
 and here yusbi on the network port 

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:40.120
 Here there is actually a working scheme for 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:42.039
 there is no network port on my laptop 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.870
 and while at exhibitions we use only 

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:45.580
 Naturally cable to video 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:47.919
 I always use this download 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.720
 I have a laptop adapter at all 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:51.370
 lenovo a trick is not any other brand 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.720
 also known brand and all together 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.909
 working with a problem 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.860
 nothing interest rates and two more 

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:58.750
 important points of the first it is natural 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.669
 offline time and cheese 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:03.280
 promise four and a half hours of such 

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:04.870
 numbers I do not know how they can achieve 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.470
 somehow they periodically turn off 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.440
 exercise 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:09.030
 slyly and then 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:12.120
 it is but in short I have processed 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:13.650
 3:20 this is what I think is the most faithful 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.720
 way to check without any there 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:17.400
 synthetic tests I just turn on and 

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.320
 wait for the video on youtube that many of you 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.460
 do naturally by wifi and complete 

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.780
 brightness because the minimum brightness 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:23.580
 I'm fine people practically 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:27.270
 never works and 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:28.800
 the mode and the mode are balanced that is it 

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:31.170
 not the highest performance 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.400
 not all and all processor power 

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:34.890
 involved in my shorter 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:37.590
 simply surfing mode and wait for the video 

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:40.320
 Youtube mode work 3:20 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:42.720
 and so the most important is the price of many 

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.950
 worried and grounded worried that 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:46.770
 this premium gadget 

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:48.450
 Eyser will cost tan to tosa 2060 but 

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:50.700
 he went on sale 

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:52.320
 this summer people are already selling 

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:54.780
 minimum configuration on the processor 

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:56.700
 core i5 costs only 34 thousand rubles 

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:58.590
 Rostest normally Magazine and personally 

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:01.320
 checked the shop which parade itself 

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:02.730
 scotch and bought will not call google 

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.830
 look for yourself I thought that others 

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:07.890
 Stores also have 34 thousand rubles for 

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:10.170
 Here is such an unusual device acer 

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:15.530
 aspire s7 serial version finally in 

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:15.530
