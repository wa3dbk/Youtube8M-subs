00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:04.100 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.200 

so<00:00:05.100> right<00:00:05.490> now<00:00:05.580> we're<00:00:05.700> going<00:00:05.790> to<00:00:05.879> learn<00:00:06.029> how<00:00:06.180> to

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
so right now we're going to learn how to

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.960 
so right now we're going to learn how to
do<00:00:06.450> some<00:00:06.779> power<00:00:06.990> slides<00:00:07.410> on<00:00:07.760> rollerskates<00:00:08.760> a

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
do some power slides on rollerskates a

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.830 
do some power slides on rollerskates a
power<00:00:09.269> slide<00:00:09.690> is<00:00:10.080> a<00:00:10.679> very<00:00:11.429> easy<00:00:11.790> way<00:00:12.150> to<00:00:12.179> stop

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
power slide is a very easy way to stop

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.490 
power slide is a very easy way to stop
while<00:00:13.139> your<00:00:13.410> speed<00:00:13.830> is<00:00:14.190> very<00:00:14.880> fast<00:00:15.289> the<00:00:16.289> best

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
while your speed is very fast the best

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.890 
while your speed is very fast the best
way<00:00:16.680> I<00:00:16.710> can<00:00:16.859> describe<00:00:17.190> it<00:00:17.490> is<00:00:17.640> think<00:00:18.060> of<00:00:18.240> Zorro

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
way I can describe it is think of Zorro

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.810 
way I can describe it is think of Zorro
and<00:00:19.850> when<00:00:20.850> they<00:00:21.000> do<00:00:21.060> their<00:00:21.539> nice<00:00:21.930> little

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:22.820 
and when they do their nice little

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.730 
and when they do their nice little
fencing<00:00:23.820> technique<00:00:24.390> so<00:00:24.720> when<00:00:25.320> you're<00:00:25.470> bent

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
fencing technique so when you're bent

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.759 
fencing technique so when you're bent
down<00:00:25.980> in<00:00:26.699> your<00:00:27.630> ready<00:00:28.140> position<00:00:28.230> you'll

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
down in your ready position you'll

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.410 
down in your ready position you'll
actually<00:00:28.949> be<00:00:29.369> going<00:00:29.699> in<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.939> opposite

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
actually be going in the opposite

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.900 
actually be going in the opposite
direction<00:00:30.480> backwards<00:00:31.109> as<00:00:31.619> you<00:00:32.309> put<00:00:32.669> pressure

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
direction backwards as you put pressure

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.360 
direction backwards as you put pressure
on<00:00:33.149> your<00:00:33.480> front<00:00:33.809> leg<00:00:34.079> you're<00:00:34.890> going<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:35.160> have<00:00:35.340> a

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
on your front leg you're going to have a

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.639 
on your front leg you're going to have a
straight<00:00:35.880> leg<00:00:36.090> all<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.360> way<00:00:36.480> down<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:37.050> have

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
straight leg all the way down and have

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.160 
straight leg all the way down and have
pressure<00:00:38.070> on<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.399> inside<00:00:38.969> wheels<00:00:39.360> so<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:39.899> kind

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
pressure on the inside wheels so it kind

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.670 
pressure on the inside wheels so it kind
of<00:00:40.290> comes<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:40.890> complete<00:00:41.160> stop<00:00:42.110> backwards<00:00:43.110> so

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
of comes to a complete stop backwards so

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.340 
of comes to a complete stop backwards so
you<00:00:43.710> start<00:00:44.309> out<00:00:44.460> forward<00:00:44.910> you<00:00:45.450> do<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.809> initial

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
you start out forward you do the initial

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.470 
you start out forward you do the initial
hockey<00:00:46.770> stop<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.520> then<00:00:47.910> you're<00:00:48.300> actually

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
hockey stop and then you're actually

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.600 
hockey stop and then you're actually
turning<00:00:49.079> around<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.590> skate<00:00:49.890> backwards<00:00:50.039> so

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
turning around to skate backwards so

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.119 
turning around to skate backwards so
this<00:00:50.789> is<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.030> more<00:00:51.329> advanced<00:00:51.780> skill<00:00:52.199> but<00:00:52.860> again

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
this is a more advanced skill but again

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.310 
this is a more advanced skill but again
it<00:00:53.280> can<00:00:53.430> be<00:00:53.460> used<00:00:53.760> for<00:00:53.940> roller<00:00:54.390> skating<00:00:55.020> in<00:00:55.289> the

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
it can be used for roller skating in the

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.979 
it can be used for roller skating in the
parks<00:00:55.860> it<00:00:56.039> can<00:00:56.190> be<00:00:56.309> used<00:00:56.489> for<00:00:56.640> Derby<00:00:56.989> dance

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
parks it can be used for Derby dance

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.279 
parks it can be used for Derby dance
skating<00:00:58.620> very<00:00:59.489> style<00:00:59.850> skating<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.600> pretty

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289

here we go skating forwards knees bent

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.030 
here we go skating forwards knees bent

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
turning and down and there's your Zorro

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.420 
turning and down and there's your Zorro
right<00:01:14.369> there<00:01:14.640> okay<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:19.070> notice<00:01:20.070> how<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:20.250> get

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
right there okay and notice how you get

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.310 
right there okay and notice how you get
a<00:01:20.460> little<00:01:20.790> bit<00:01:20.909> more<00:01:21.060> slide<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:21.840> this<00:01:22.259> is

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
a little bit more slide and this is

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.840 
a little bit more slide and this is
where<00:01:22.680> your<00:01:22.860> balance<00:01:23.040> should<00:01:23.460> be<00:01:23.520> you<00:01:23.820> should

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
where your balance should be you should

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.580 
where your balance should be you should
have<00:01:24.240> a<00:01:24.270> lot<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:24.600> weight<00:01:24.869> on<00:01:25.049> your<00:01:25.170> front<00:01:25.409> foot

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
have a lot of weight on your front foot

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.100 
have a lot of weight on your front foot
and<00:01:26.040> then<00:01:26.520> your<00:01:26.700> slide<00:01:27.060> is<00:01:27.390> where<00:01:27.689> it<00:01:27.810> needs<00:01:27.990> to

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
and then your slide is where it needs to

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.050 
and then your slide is where it needs to
be<00:01:28.170> straight<00:01:28.680> back<00:01:28.920> so<00:01:29.159> if<00:01:29.310> I<00:01:29.460> pull<00:01:29.670> my<00:01:29.820> feet

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
be straight back so if I pull my feet

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.960 
be straight back so if I pull my feet
back<00:01:30.240> together<00:01:30.479> I'm<00:01:30.960> still<00:01:31.740> underneath<00:01:32.579> my

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
back together I'm still underneath my

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.999 
back together I'm still underneath my
body<00:01:33.210> but<00:01:34.049> you<00:01:34.140> want<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.350> make<00:01:34.500> sure<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:34.829> it's

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
body but you want to make sure that it's

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.219 
body but you want to make sure that it's
not<00:01:35.189> here<00:01:35.759> because<00:01:36.299> then<00:01:36.479> you'll<00:01:36.600> do<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.750> circle

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
not here because then you'll do a circle

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.050 
not here because then you'll do a circle
or<00:01:37.409> over<00:01:37.950> there<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:38.640> can<00:01:38.759> pull<00:01:38.939> you

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
or over there and it can pull you

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.330 
or over there and it can pull you
backwards<00:01:39.479> okay<00:01:39.869> so<00:01:40.229> here<00:01:40.439> we<00:01:40.530> go<00:01:40.650> again

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
backwards okay so here we go again

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
backwards okay so here we go again
