it's<00:03:09.950> got<00:03:10.070> a<00:03:10.100> brand<00:03:10.400> new<00:03:10.460> oil<00:03:10.610> pressure

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880

I<00:05:31.750> just<00:05:32.260> got<00:05:32.440> a<00:05:32.470> 4-wheel<00:05:32.920> alignment<00:05:32.980> on<00:05:33.550> it<00:05:33.730> so

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970 
I just got a 4-wheel alignment on it so

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:36.330 
I just got a 4-wheel alignment on it so
it<00:05:34.780> runs<00:05:35.020> down<00:05:35.290> the<00:05:35.440> road<00:05:35.620> rule<00:05:35.860> some<00:05:36.130> of<00:05:36.250> the
