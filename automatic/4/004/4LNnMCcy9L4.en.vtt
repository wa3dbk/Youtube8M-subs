really really good actually I thought
they<00:03:04.319> were<00:03:04.409> really<00:03:04.650> light<00:03:05.010> across<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.459> ice

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
they were really light across the ice

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.569 
they were really light across the ice
love<00:03:06.689> the<00:03:07.019> sharpness<00:03:07.500> from<00:03:07.889> these<00:03:08.040> two<00:03:08.250> it's<00:03:08.489> a

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
love the sharpness from these two it's a

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:10.309 
love the sharpness from these two it's a
slightly<00:03:08.939> different<00:03:09.359> interpretation<00:03:09.450> again

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
slightly different interpretation again

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.099 
slightly different interpretation again
and<00:03:10.700> they'll<00:03:11.700> stick<00:03:11.969> in<00:03:12.090> there<00:03:12.239> their<00:03:12.719> neck<00:03:12.930> on

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
and they'll stick in there their neck on

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:14.770 
and they'll stick in there their neck on
the<00:03:13.200> chopping<00:03:13.230> block<00:03:13.590> a<00:03:13.769> little<00:03:14.129> bit<00:03:14.250> but<00:03:14.549> I

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
the chopping block a little bit but I

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.659 
the chopping block a little bit but I
really<00:03:15.780> really<00:03:16.109> enjoyed<00:03:16.709> it<00:03:16.950> I<00:03:17.099> think

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:17.669 
really really enjoyed it I think

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:21.619 
really really enjoyed it I think
technically<00:03:18.299> they<00:03:18.480> have<00:03:19.489> such<00:03:20.489> quality<00:03:21.299> and

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:21.629 
technically they have such quality and

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:25.490 
technically they have such quality and
every<00:03:22.560> step<00:03:23.010> it's<00:03:23.310> so<00:03:23.689> precise<00:03:24.689> and<00:03:24.719> secure

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
every step it's so precise and secure

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.020 
every step it's so precise and secure
and<00:03:26.930> they<00:03:27.930> sold<00:03:28.319> it<00:03:28.500> very<00:03:29.040> very<00:03:29.280> well<00:03:29.609> didn't

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
and they sold it very very well didn't

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:32.599 
and they sold it very very well didn't
seem<00:03:30.269> to<00:03:30.419> have<00:03:30.569> perhaps<00:03:31.530> the<00:03:31.859> chemistry<00:03:32.519> of

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
seem to have perhaps the chemistry of

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:35.360 
seem to have perhaps the chemistry of
the<00:03:32.699> Canadians<00:03:33.209> the<00:03:34.139> joy<00:03:34.469> wasn't<00:03:34.980> there<00:03:35.129> was

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
the Canadians the joy wasn't there was

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.990 
the Canadians the joy wasn't there was
it<00:03:35.989> but<00:03:36.989> it<00:03:37.829> could<00:03:38.219> have<00:03:38.310> almost<00:03:38.549> been<00:03:38.730> written

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
it but it could have almost been written

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.050 
it but it could have almost been written
for<00:03:39.269> them<00:03:39.329> this<00:03:39.540> I<00:03:39.689> felt

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
and it's if you get the knees working

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.890 
and it's if you get the knees working
right<00:03:58.460> then<00:03:58.700> you<00:03:58.790> get<00:03:58.940> that<00:03:59.090> rhythm<00:03:59.330> going

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
right then you get that rhythm going

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.010 
right then you get that rhythm going
that's<00:04:00.500> what<00:04:00.740> creates<00:04:01.130> that<00:04:01.370> that<00:04:02.300> lightness

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:03.020 
that's what creates that that lightness

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.620 
that's what creates that that lightness
of<00:04:03.230> flow<00:04:03.680> across<00:04:04.040> the<00:04:04.220> ice<00:04:04.340> which<00:04:05.150> these<00:04:05.360> two
