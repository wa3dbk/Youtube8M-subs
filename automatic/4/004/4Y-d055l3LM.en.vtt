just play offline then there you go like

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.039 
just play offline then there you go like
that<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:23.549> can't<00:01:23.729> go<00:01:23.970> online<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.540> get<00:01:24.630> offline

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
boo slots it doesn't work like that the

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.249 
boo slots it doesn't work like that the
offline<00:01:27.600> would<00:01:27.750> just<00:01:27.960> be<00:01:28.490> 4i<00:01:29.810> guess<00:01:30.810> offline<00:01:31.170> I

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
offline would just be 4i guess offline I

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.230 
offline would just be 4i guess offline I
think<00:01:31.770> that's<00:01:31.920> how<00:01:32.009> it<00:01:32.100> works<00:01:32.130> not<00:01:32.939> too<00:01:32.970> sure

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
think that's how it works not too sure

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.609 
think that's how it works not too sure
you<00:01:33.420> guys<00:01:33.570> cannot<00:01:33.900> correct<00:01:34.200> me<00:01:34.320> on<00:01:34.380> that<00:01:34.530> if

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
you guys cannot correct me on that if

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.700 
you guys cannot correct me on that if
I'm<00:01:34.740> wrong<00:01:34.920> but<00:01:35.210> so<00:01:36.210> far<00:01:37.049> from<00:01:37.439> what<00:01:37.590> I've<00:01:37.680> seen

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
not too good then that could be a issue

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.420

to put it into it maybe doing some some
math<00:03:09.060> and<00:03:09.269> crunching<00:03:09.629> some<00:03:09.810> numbers<00:03:09.870> to<00:03:10.859> kind

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
math and crunching some numbers to kind

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:15.319 
math and crunching some numbers to kind
of<00:03:11.129> get<00:03:11.340> idea<00:03:12.439> you<00:03:13.439> know<00:03:13.560> what<00:03:14.069> exactly<00:03:14.730> you

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
more two ways to do is that lots of

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.960 
more two ways to do is that lots of
people<00:03:18.359> do<00:03:18.660> different<00:03:18.780> player<00:03:19.109> builds<00:03:19.910> when<00:03:20.910> I

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
people do different player builds when I

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
this it definitely seems like maybe the

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.719 
this it definitely seems like maybe the
two<00:03:43.409> way<00:03:43.560> forward<00:03:43.919> build<00:03:43.949> isn't<00:03:44.459> going<00:03:44.579> to<00:03:44.639> be

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:44.729 
two way forward build isn't going to be

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:47.569 
two way forward build isn't going to be
as<00:03:44.849> powerful<00:03:45.030> as<00:03:45.389> it<00:03:45.449> used<00:03:45.690> to<00:03:45.750> be<00:03:46.370> it's<00:03:47.370> kind

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
as powerful as it used to be it's kind

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
of all up in the air right now since

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.640 
of all up in the air right now since
everyone<00:03:49.919> kind<00:03:50.099> of<00:03:50.190> still<00:03:50.489> has<00:03:51.440> the<00:03:52.440> lower

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
everyone kind of still has the lower

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.080 
everyone kind of still has the lower
cards<00:03:53.129> as<00:03:53.280> opposed<00:03:54.090> to<00:03:54.269> the<00:03:54.329> legend<00:03:54.659> cards<00:03:54.900> I

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
cards as opposed to the legend cards I

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.670 
cards as opposed to the legend cards I
mean<00:03:57.090> with<00:03:57.239> that<00:03:57.359> being<00:03:57.510> said<00:03:57.599> though<00:03:57.930> I<00:03:58.199> think

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
mean with that being said though I think

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.460 
mean with that being said though I think
once<00:03:59.359> you<00:04:00.359> kind<00:04:00.510> of<00:04:00.599> get<00:04:00.780> the<00:04:00.840> XP<00:04:01.199> to<00:04:01.260> play

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
once you kind of get the XP to play

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:02.449 
once you kind of get the XP to play
around<00:04:01.590> with<00:04:01.859> you<00:04:02.010> can<00:04:02.159> do<00:04:02.280> different

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
around with you can do different

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.099 
around with you can do different
strategies<00:04:03.000> and<00:04:03.180> maybe<00:04:03.299> focus<00:04:03.810> more

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:04.109 
strategies and maybe focus more

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:05.599 
strategies and maybe focus more
offensively<00:04:04.799> especially<00:04:05.310> if<00:04:05.370> you<00:04:05.459> have<00:04:05.489> a

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:05.609 
offensively especially if you have a

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:08.750 
offensively especially if you have a
team<00:04:05.909> that<00:04:06.180> you<00:04:06.840> know<00:04:06.989> have<00:04:07.590> two<00:04:08.159> good<00:04:08.340> demon

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.240 
team that you know have two good demon
and<00:04:08.940> a<00:04:09.150> goalie<00:04:09.419> and<00:04:09.750> you<00:04:10.169> can<00:04:10.319> focus<00:04:10.500> on<00:04:10.949> doing

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
and a goalie and you can focus on doing

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.770 
and a goalie and you can focus on doing
just<00:04:11.430> your<00:04:11.879> position<00:04:12.329> but<00:04:12.479> if<00:04:12.599> you<00:04:12.659> know

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780
