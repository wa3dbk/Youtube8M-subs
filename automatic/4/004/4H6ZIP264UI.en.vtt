00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.850
 Saints 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:15.039
 mee motor this to tie and dignity the sequel to one of the titles of 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:18.489
 most popular extreme driving that will mark the launch of playstation 

00:00:18.489 --> 00:00:19.329
 3

 it is already good between us willing to repeat again its same great 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.609
 success 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.220
 born in blue 1 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.290
 I felt bad for the elements 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.600
 a great value for nature 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.380
 miami 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.380
 won by man 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.340
 on this occasion the game modalities in which they participate are 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.300
 divided mainly into two 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.690
 one called the festival and the second under the name of violent fun 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.980
 encompassing the first of them 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.650
 the tournaments and championships that the title proposes to us to be played in 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.670
 solitary while the second one we have the multiplayer ones 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.970
 online and other secondary modes who will detail something later 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.030
 to mention the modality of 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.030
 It has four loading equipment 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.420
 with a characteristic ambience either land there 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.750
 then obama 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.150
 being more than evident these are the two names what we will find 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.150
 when running 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.370
 regarding the vehicles with which to compete this time we have 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.580
 Assumption up to eight different classes and more specifically in moto2 quads 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.030
 willis rally cars rancheras four by four also styles 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.250
 new meadow masters being able the latter to wind everything to their 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.190
 step passing is literally missing above the other runners 

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:36.429
 choose between one or another vehicle brand in Iran 

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:39.079
 linked to the gaming experience during each game 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:42.449
 since the lighter ones will give us more maneuverability and the 

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:45.399
 to travel through the narrowest places 

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:47.559
 although on the contrary they are 

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:49.419
 exposed topics will be 

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:52.419
 take damage if a rival hits them 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:04.299
 the mechanics of the game as the supreme 

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.959
 the bugle diary 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:07.969
 so although text 

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:10.499
 another vehicle or street to Moscow 

00:03:10.499 --> 00:03:13.499
 this one always get back on track and in just a couple of seconds 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:19.930
 or when we want it to remain active between 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:24.019
 which was conveniently 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:26.289
 will be one of the keys to victory 

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:30.039
 although having to keep in mind that if we abuse it cross 

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:33.039
 it was very long our vehicle burned in flames 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:44.299
 As for the rest of the game modes in which the title invites us to 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:47.999
 participate in the fords in the aforementioned violent fun modality 

00:03:47.999 --> 00:03:52.619
 we have a free game against the clock play a split screen from the same 

00:03:52.619 --> 00:03:56.479
 console and without a doubt the one that will truly guarantee us 

00:03:56.479 --> 00:03:58.829
 endless hours of pure adrenaline 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:00.899
 online multiplayer mode 

00:04:00.899 --> 00:04:05.569
 giving support for games of a total of 12 simultaneous users already 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:07.989
 that we also have to add diverse with 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:10.989
 carnivals that are added periodically 

00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:21.069
 In technical terms, the graphical section of the 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:25.289
 hector data modeling 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:28.289
 being quite striking how these are deteriorating 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.580
 although maybe not 

00:04:34.809 --> 00:04:37.809
 he twinkles something chaotic he 

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:42.189
 only two 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.680
 On the other hand, the experts 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.349
 are the ones that truly 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:51.150
 the greatest role 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.759
 standing out for its great visual beauty and incredible retro design 

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:58.919
 of details having all of them different shortcuts alternative routes to 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:03.389
 choose and a route of the most abrupt and wild that causes it to be quite 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:06.819
 or worse, deepened 

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:08.770
 crashed to all 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.770
 some rock until we know each other 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.879
 conclusion despite some sections that are still 

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:24.430
 for polishing and improving enter 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:25.710
 the deliveries of the saga 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.710
 motorstorm pacific rift 

00:05:29.439 --> 00:05:32.489
 and more recommendable arcade driving titles of the current 

00:05:32.489 --> 00:05:33.479
 generation 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:37.029
 being a title almost essential for any user of playstation 

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:43.099
 although perhaps those that were already made at the time with the first part was 

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:46.159
 giving against 

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:50.629
 and this sequel is largely due to the great similarity that exists in many 

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:52.870
 aspects between both 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.870
 a few months of rest 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.080
 while in the sea 

00:06:04.889 --> 00:06:06.689
 you are welcome 

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:07.529
 like others
