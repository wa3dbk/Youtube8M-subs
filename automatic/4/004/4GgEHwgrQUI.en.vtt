the<00:01:23.520> medical<00:01:23.790> system<00:01:23.880> also<00:01:24.090> believes<00:01:24.450> that

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
the medical system also believes that

the medical system also believes that

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
there's a that substitution in the case

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.410 
there's a that substitution in the case
of<00:01:28.110> for<00:01:28.500> instance<00:01:28.829> of<00:01:29.100> hormones<00:01:29.939> like<00:01:30.150> thyroid

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
of for instance of hormones like thyroid

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.350 
of for instance of hormones like thyroid
or<00:01:30.900> estrogen<00:01:31.110> is<00:01:31.439> if<00:01:32.280> we<00:01:32.400> can<00:01:32.520> just<00:01:32.640> bring<00:01:33.180> them

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
or estrogen is if we can just bring them

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.330 
or estrogen is if we can just bring them
from<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.659> outside<00:01:33.720> into<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.770> body<00:01:35.009> that's

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
from the outside into the body that's

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.859 
from the outside into the body that's
just<00:01:35.670> as<00:01:35.850> good<00:01:35.970> as<00:01:36.090> if<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.299> body<00:01:36.479> makes<00:01:36.720> it

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
just as good as if the body makes it

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.330 
just as good as if the body makes it
itself<00:01:37.170> medical<00:01:37.650> system<00:01:37.860> is<00:01:37.950> sometimes

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
itself medical system is sometimes

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.590 
itself medical system is sometimes
easier<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:39.540> I<00:01:39.630> say<00:01:39.840> this<00:01:40.020> because<00:01:40.439> the

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
easier and I say this because the

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.789 
easier and I say this because the
patient<00:01:42.600> is<00:01:42.659> really<00:01:42.930> asked<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:43.470> make<00:01:43.619> any

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
lifestyle changes in most cases if they

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.410

care<00:04:13.820> the<00:04:14.000> holistic<00:04:14.360> approach<00:04:14.690> because<00:04:15.290> to<00:04:15.380> me

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
care the holistic approach because to me

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.890 
care the holistic approach because to me
it's<00:04:15.620> like<00:04:15.770> it's<00:04:16.010> like<00:04:16.130> a<00:04:16.220> car<00:04:16.580> yeah<00:04:17.239> when<00:04:17.810> you

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
it's like it's like a car yeah when you

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.080 
it's like it's like a car yeah when you
have<00:04:18.049> your<00:04:18.230> the<00:04:18.620> oil<00:04:19.190> light<00:04:19.370> comes<00:04:19.580> on<00:04:19.700> the<00:04:19.880> car

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
have your the oil light comes on the car

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.950 
have your the oil light comes on the car
and<00:04:20.210> you<00:04:20.299> have<00:04:20.560> two<00:04:21.560> solutions<00:04:21.770> right<00:04:22.960> one

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
and you have two solutions right one

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.010 
and you have two solutions right one
solution<00:04:24.440> is<00:04:24.590> to<00:04:24.890> either<00:04:25.070> put<00:04:25.370> ducttape

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
solution is to either put ducttape

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.520 
solution is to either put ducttape
over<00:04:27.380> the<00:04:27.590> oil<00:04:28.460> indicator<00:04:29.030> or<00:04:29.479> snip<00:04:30.169> the<00:04:30.319> wire

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
over the oil indicator or snip the wire

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.800 
over the oil indicator or snip the wire
that<00:04:30.889> sends<00:04:31.370> the<00:04:31.490> light<00:04:31.520> to<00:04:31.849> it<00:04:32.000> and<00:04:32.150> you<00:04:32.690> can

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
that sends the light to it and you can

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.570 
that sends the light to it and you can
say<00:04:32.930> well<00:04:33.050> I<00:04:33.110> solved<00:04:33.500> the<00:04:33.590> problem<00:04:34.009> and<00:04:34.220> to<00:04:34.460> me

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
say well I solved the problem and to me

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.490 
say well I solved the problem and to me
you<00:04:34.669> didn't<00:04:34.910> solve<00:04:35.090> the<00:04:35.240> problem<00:04:35.660> I<00:04:35.870> want<00:04:36.440> to

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:36.500
