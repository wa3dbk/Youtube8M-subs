usually do is pull on here and then pull
it<00:03:04.890> up<00:03:04.980> on<00:03:05.160> to<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:05.430> alternator<00:03:06.470> so<00:03:07.470> I'll<00:03:07.680> kind

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
it up on to the alternator so I'll kind

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.800 
it up on to the alternator so I'll kind
of<00:03:08.160> show<00:03:08.520> you<00:03:08.670> that<00:03:08.760> can't<00:03:09.239> really<00:03:09.420> fill<00:03:09.690> it

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
of show you that can't really fill it

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:38.820 

keep<00:03:32.260> down<00:03:33.629> just<00:03:35.400> make<00:03:36.400> a<00:03:36.430> loop<00:03:37.530> make<00:03:38.530> sure<00:03:38.769> it

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
keep down just make a loop make sure it

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:44.420 
keep down just make a loop make sure it
goes<00:03:39.720> all<00:03:40.720> the<00:03:40.780> way<00:03:40.930> around<00:03:41.290> the<00:03:41.379> crank<00:03:41.709> pulley

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:55.580 

up<00:03:45.430> over<00:03:45.909> the<00:03:46.060> water<00:03:46.299> pump<00:03:46.750> here<00:03:50.459> down<00:03:53.040> around

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
up over the water pump here down around

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:11.570 
up over the water pump here down around
our<00:03:56.590> studio

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.150 

okay<00:04:12.580> so<00:04:13.230> first<00:04:14.230> I<00:04:14.440> went<00:04:14.530> down<00:04:14.770> around<00:04:15.010> my

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
okay so first I went down around my

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.790 
okay so first I went down around my
crank<00:04:15.460> pulley<00:04:16.110> up<00:04:17.110> and<00:04:17.350> around<00:04:17.530> the<00:04:17.650> water

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:17.800 
crank pulley up and around the water

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.729 
crank pulley up and around the water
pump<00:04:18.220> with<00:04:18.520> the<00:04:18.640> backside<00:04:19.060> of<00:04:19.239> the<00:04:19.300> belt<00:04:19.739> then

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
pump with the backside of the belt then

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:30.690 
pump with the backside of the belt then
around<00:04:21.900> the<00:04:23.910> power<00:04:24.910> steering<00:04:25.360> pump<00:04:29.400> okay<00:04:30.400> and

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700 
around the power steering pump okay and

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.040 
around the power steering pump okay and
so<00:04:30.820> now<00:04:30.850> I<00:04:31.000> have<00:04:31.650> this<00:04:32.650> part<00:04:33.160> that<00:04:33.310> I<00:04:33.340> can<00:04:33.490> hold

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
so now I have this part that I can hold

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.440 
so now I have this part that I can hold
to<00:04:35.050> put<00:04:35.740> on<00:04:35.860> to<00:04:36.040> the<00:04:36.160> alternator<00:04:36.490> and<00:04:37.180> so

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450 
to put on to the alternator and so

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:52.740 
to put on to the alternator and so
therefore<00:04:48.990> my<00:04:49.990> socket<00:04:51.000> and<00:04:52.000> on<00:04:52.150> my<00:04:52.330> 15

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
therefore my socket and on my 15

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.860 
therefore my socket and on my 15
millimeter<00:04:53.170> bolt<00:04:53.440> on<00:04:53.650> my<00:04:53.830> tensioner<00:04:54.660> okay<00:04:55.660> and

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
millimeter bolt on my tensioner okay and

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.630 
millimeter bolt on my tensioner okay and
then<00:04:55.990> while<00:04:56.230> I<00:04:56.260> pull<00:04:56.760> this<00:04:57.760> way<00:04:59.460> on<00:05:00.460> the

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:00.640 
then while I pull this way on the

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:09.039 
then while I pull this way on the
tensioner<00:05:01.740> take<00:05:02.740> the<00:05:02.950> belt<00:05:03.510> and<00:05:04.510> pull<00:05:04.840> it<00:05:04.960> up

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:09.049 

00:05:09.049 --> 00:05:18.409 

on<00:05:10.049> to<00:05:11.089> the<00:05:12.089> alternator<00:05:16.759> and<00:05:17.759> the<00:05:17.999> tensioner

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
on to the alternator and the tensioner

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:21.499 
on to the alternator and the tensioner
takes<00:05:18.629> over<00:05:19.729> and<00:05:20.729> I'm<00:05:20.969> just<00:05:21.089> going<00:05:21.209> to<00:05:21.299> push<00:05:21.479> it

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:21.509 
takes over and I'm just going to push it

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:39.700 
takes over and I'm just going to push it
on<00:05:21.719> a<00:05:21.779> little<00:05:22.049> more<00:05:22.289> to<00:05:22.469> my<00:05:22.589> idler<00:05:22.949> pulley<00:05:23.189> here

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710
