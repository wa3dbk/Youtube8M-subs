00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:05.660 

so<00:00:04.110> this<00:00:04.259> morning<00:00:04.620> I<00:00:04.710> had<00:00:04.859> an<00:00:04.980> errand<00:00:05.220> to<00:00:05.250> run<00:00:05.310> I

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
so this morning I had an errand to run I

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.240 
so this morning I had an errand to run I
came<00:00:06.089> out<00:00:06.359> I<00:00:06.629> put<00:00:07.109> my<00:00:07.230> key<00:00:07.440> in<00:00:07.470> just<00:00:07.890> like<00:00:08.040> that

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
came out I put my key in just like that

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.370 
came out I put my key in just like that
push<00:00:08.610> the<00:00:08.730> clutch<00:00:08.880> down<00:00:10.790> nada

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:12.380 
push the clutch down nada

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.829 
push the clutch down nada
battery<00:00:13.380> is<00:00:13.469> completely<00:00:14.250> dead<00:00:14.639> what<00:00:15.450> happened

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
battery is completely dead what happened

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.439 
battery is completely dead what happened
was<00:00:16.049> I<00:00:16.320> left<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.619> ignition<00:00:17.010> on

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:17.449 
was I left the ignition on

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:21.230 
was I left the ignition on
so<00:00:18.980> the<00:00:19.980> hood<00:00:20.160> on<00:00:20.279> my<00:00:20.400> other<00:00:20.490> car<00:00:20.760> won't<00:00:20.970> open

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
so the hood on my other car won't open

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.269 
so the hood on my other car won't open
so<00:00:22.199> we're<00:00:22.320> gonna<00:00:22.410> try<00:00:22.619> starting<00:00:22.980> this

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
so we're gonna try starting this

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.609 
so we're gonna try starting this
jump-starting<00:00:23.910> this<00:00:24.060> with<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.269> klx<00:00:24.720> now<00:00:25.140> here's

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
jump-starting this with a klx now here's

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.790 
jump-starting this with a klx now here's
my<00:00:25.800> rationale<00:00:26.430> for<00:00:26.670> why<00:00:26.820> this<00:00:26.880> is<00:00:27.060> gonna<00:00:27.300> work

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
my rationale for why this is gonna work

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.769 
my rationale for why this is gonna work
any<00:00:28.800> electrical<00:00:29.490> system<00:00:29.970> if<00:00:30.179> it's<00:00:30.359> designed

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
any electrical system if it's designed

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.500 
any electrical system if it's designed
well<00:00:31.080> which<00:00:31.980> I'd<00:00:32.130> like<00:00:32.279> to<00:00:32.430> think<00:00:32.640> Kawasaki<00:00:33.210> is

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
well which I'd like to think Kawasaki is

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.569 
well which I'd like to think Kawasaki is
designed<00:00:33.899> well<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:34.829> should<00:00:34.980> be<00:00:35.100> able<00:00:35.219> to<00:00:35.340> run

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
designed well it should be able to run

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.139 
designed well it should be able to run
without<00:00:35.969> a<00:00:36.000> battery<00:00:36.530> which<00:00:37.530> means<00:00:37.969> the<00:00:38.969> only

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
without a battery which means the only

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.150 
without a battery which means the only
current<00:00:39.540> that<00:00:39.660> actually<00:00:40.079> goes<00:00:40.320> towards<00:00:40.980> the

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
current that actually goes towards the

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.580 
current that actually goes towards the
battery<00:00:41.520> there's<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.180> surplus<00:00:42.570> current<00:00:43.110> after

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
battery there's a surplus current after

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:50.119 
battery there's a surplus current after
powering<00:00:44.160> everything<00:00:45.000> else<00:00:47.360> so<00:00:48.770> these<00:00:49.770> notes

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
powering everything else so these notes

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.760 
powering everything else so these notes
here<00:00:50.610> will<00:00:51.420> always<00:00:51.629> have<00:00:52.020> 12<00:00:52.379> volts<00:00:52.680> across

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
here will always have 12 volts across

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.040 
here will always have 12 volts across
them<00:00:53.160> well<00:00:53.969> we<00:00:54.059> got<00:00:54.180> this<00:00:54.300> out<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:54.629> can<00:00:54.690> see<00:00:54.930> my

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
them well we got this out you can see my

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.970 
them well we got this out you can see my
trickle<00:00:55.350> charger<00:00:55.820> connect<00:00:56.820> did<00:00:57.030> refuse<00:00:58.020> how

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
trickle charger connect did refuse how

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.260 
trickle charger connect did refuse how
about<00:00:59.100> that<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.309> didn't<00:00:59.550> even<00:00:59.640> notice<00:00:59.820> this<00:01:00.090> guy

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
about that I didn't even notice this guy

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.490 
about that I didn't even notice this guy
so<00:01:00.420> you<00:01:00.510> know<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:00.750> little<00:01:00.870> voice<00:01:01.140> in<00:01:01.440> the

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
so you know that little voice in the

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.930 
so you know that little voice in the
back<00:01:01.649> your<00:01:01.859> head<00:01:01.890> tells<00:01:02.460> you<00:01:02.609> what<00:01:02.789> you're

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
back your head tells you what you're

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.359 
back your head tells you what you're
doing<00:01:02.969> is<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.390> bad<00:01:03.660> idea

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
doing is a bad idea

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:06.560 
doing is a bad idea
yeah<00:01:05.369> I'm<00:01:05.460> ignoring<00:01:05.760> that<00:01:06.030> one<00:01:06.210> worst-case

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
yeah I'm ignoring that one worst-case

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:07.910 
yeah I'm ignoring that one worst-case
scenario<00:01:06.930> if<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.110> bite<00:01:07.229> doesn't<00:01:07.260> start<00:01:07.710> I<00:01:07.799> can

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
scenario if the bite doesn't start I can

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.410 
scenario if the bite doesn't start I can
pump<00:01:08.100> start<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.430> plate<00:01:08.580> I'm<00:01:08.760> not<00:01:08.880> too<00:01:09.090> worried

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
pump start to plate I'm not too worried

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.899 
pump start to plate I'm not too worried
about<00:01:09.479> that<00:01:10.010> so<00:01:11.010> we'll<00:01:11.159> turn<00:01:11.310> our<00:01:11.460> flashlight

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
about that so we'll turn our flashlight

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:26.780 
about that so we'll turn our flashlight
back<00:01:12.060> on<00:01:12.240> here<00:01:12.510> we<00:01:13.260> go<00:01:15.170> ground<00:01:17.119> to<00:01:19.280> ground

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:37.980 

kinda<00:01:32.610> there<00:01:33.610> we<00:01:33.670> go<00:01:33.790> ground<00:01:34.030> the<00:01:34.090> ground<00:01:36.990> to

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
kinda there we go ground the ground to

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.760 
kinda there we go ground the ground to
the<00:01:38.020> hut

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
the hut

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.520 
the hut
oh<00:01:39.689> it's<00:01:40.689> cramped<00:01:41.110> in<00:01:41.200> there<00:01:43.290> those<00:01:44.290> zones

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
oh it's cramped in there those zones

00:01:44.530 --> 00:02:03.270 
oh it's cramped in there those zones
aren't<00:01:44.740> touching<00:01:59.130> -<00:02:01.170> there<00:02:02.170> we<00:02:02.259> go<00:02:02.440> we<00:02:03.009> have

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
aren't touching - there we go we have

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.100 
aren't touching - there we go we have
but<00:02:04.270> connected<00:02:04.780> ground<00:02:05.050> connected<00:02:06.990> now<00:02:07.990> on

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
but connected ground connected now on

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.140 
but connected ground connected now on
this<00:02:08.259> end<00:02:08.500> I<00:02:08.940> got<00:02:09.940> these<00:02:10.149> keep<00:02:10.479> them<00:02:10.600> separate

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
this end I got these keep them separate

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:18.990 
this end I got these keep them separate
we're<00:02:13.150> to<00:02:13.209> put<00:02:13.360> the<00:02:13.450> light<00:02:14.280> right<00:02:15.280> oh<00:02:17.280> yeah

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
we're to put the light right oh yeah

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.559 
we're to put the light right oh yeah
all<00:02:19.330> right<00:02:19.480> ground<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:19.870> ground<00:02:21.450> we<00:02:22.450> will

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
all right ground the ground we will

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:26.789 
all right ground the ground we will
connect<00:02:22.989> right<00:02:23.230> here<00:02:24.390> and<00:02:25.390> Hut<00:02:25.660> to<00:02:25.780> Hut<00:02:25.810> that's

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799 
connect right here and Hut to Hut that's

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:29.130 
connect right here and Hut to Hut that's
a<00:02:26.890> little<00:02:27.040> more<00:02:27.220> like<00:02:27.340> what<00:02:27.370> I<00:02:27.489> expected<00:02:28.140> and

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
a little more like what I expected and

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.740 
a little more like what I expected and
the<00:02:29.560> lights<00:02:29.829> come<00:02:30.190> on<00:02:30.269> all<00:02:31.269> right<00:02:31.329> this<00:02:31.630> is

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
the lights come on all right this is

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.800 
the lights come on all right this is
promising<00:02:32.260> well<00:02:32.709> see<00:02:32.829> if<00:02:32.920> it<00:02:33.010> starts<00:02:33.510> okay<00:02:34.510> not

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
promising well see if it starts okay not

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.289 
promising well see if it starts okay not
quite<00:02:34.930> yet<00:02:35.370> so<00:02:36.370> we<00:02:36.459> need<00:02:36.489> to<00:02:36.700> let<00:02:36.820> it<00:02:36.850> charge

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
quite yet so we need to let it charge

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:40.380 
quite yet so we need to let it charge
for<00:02:37.630> a<00:02:37.660> little<00:02:37.840> longer<00:02:38.549> more<00:02:39.549> revs<00:02:39.880> means<00:02:40.209> the

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
for a little longer more revs means the

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.479 
for a little longer more revs means the
engine<00:02:40.660> spinning<00:02:40.989> faster<00:02:41.530> which<00:02:41.950> means<00:02:41.980> the

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
engine spinning faster which means the

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.440 
engine spinning faster which means the
stata<00:02:43.120> here<00:02:43.570> is<00:02:44.140> generating<00:02:44.709> more<00:02:44.739> current

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
stata here is generating more current

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.759 
stata here is generating more current
which<00:02:46.450> hopefully<00:02:46.690> means<00:02:47.049> it's<00:02:47.290> charging<00:02:47.620> that

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
which hopefully means it's charging that

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:58.850 
which hopefully means it's charging that
battery<00:02:47.829> faster

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.340 

alright<00:02:59.490> let's<00:02:59.610> for<00:02:59.790> that<00:02:59.910> I'm<00:03:00.900> watching<00:03:01.080> the

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
alright let's for that I'm watching the

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.320 
alright let's for that I'm watching the
voltmeter<00:03:01.620> here<00:03:02.630> I've<00:03:03.630> got<00:03:03.870> about<00:03:03.960> nine<00:03:04.320> volts

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
voltmeter here I've got about nine volts

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.820 
voltmeter here I've got about nine volts
but<00:03:06.330> it<00:03:06.480> is<00:03:06.600> climbing<00:03:07.140> and<00:03:07.290> actually<00:03:07.590> climbing

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
but it is climbing and actually climbing

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.690 
but it is climbing and actually climbing
at<00:03:08.040> a<00:03:08.070> pretty<00:03:08.280> good<00:03:08.400> pace<00:03:11.120> it<00:03:12.120> wants<00:03:12.450> to<00:03:12.600> start

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
at a pretty good pace it wants to start

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.900 
at a pretty good pace it wants to start
really<00:03:14.700> does<00:03:15.350> this<00:03:16.350> doesn't<00:03:16.980> seem<00:03:17.310> like<00:03:17.610> it's

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
really does this doesn't seem like it's

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.840 
really does this doesn't seem like it's
working<00:03:18.600> how<00:03:19.560> are<00:03:19.620> we<00:03:19.800> doing<00:03:20.130> without<00:03:20.640> the

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
working how are we doing without the

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:27.830 
working how are we doing without the
jumper<00:03:21.210> attached<00:03:26.270> fucking<00:03:27.270> dick<00:03:27.450> did<00:03:27.660> Lea

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
jumper attached fucking dick did Lea

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.740 
jumper attached fucking dick did Lea
Reno<00:03:28.940> alright

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.220 

so<00:03:33.750> my<00:03:33.900> conclusion<00:03:34.140> here<00:03:34.950> is<00:03:35.360> that<00:03:36.360> unless<00:03:37.020> you

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
so my conclusion here is that unless you

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.440 
so my conclusion here is that unless you
have<00:03:37.470> a<00:03:37.500> very<00:03:37.980> large<00:03:38.340> bike<00:03:38.760> battery<00:03:39.180> which

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
have a very large bike battery which

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:46.610 
have a very large bike battery which
this<00:03:39.720> is<00:03:39.990> a<00:03:40.770> oh<00:03:43.280> jeez<00:03:44.660> three<00:03:45.660> cold<00:03:46.020> carrying

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
this is a oh jeez three cold carrying

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:47.870 
this is a oh jeez three cold carrying
amps<00:03:46.920> is<00:03:47.040> what<00:03:47.160> that<00:03:47.280> looks<00:03:47.460> like<00:03:47.550> from

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
amps is what that looks like from

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.280 
amps is what that looks like from
reading<00:03:48.150> that<00:03:48.270> right<00:03:48.450> so<00:03:49.020> 0.7<00:03:49.920> amps<00:03:50.310> times<00:03:51.290> 5

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
reading that right so 0.7 amps times 5

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.820 
reading that right so 0.7 amps times 5
to<00:03:52.560> 10<00:03:52.770> hours<00:03:53.100> or<00:03:54.170> three-halves<00:03:55.170> times<00:03:55.350> 1<00:03:55.620> so

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
to 10 hours or three-halves times 1 so

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:00.190 
to 10 hours or three-halves times 1 so
it<00:03:55.920> looks<00:03:56.070> like<00:03:56.220> three<00:03:56.580> cold<00:03:56.940> cranking<00:03:57.240> amps

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:06.050 

battery<00:04:01.200> in<00:04:01.320> that<00:04:01.500> is<00:04:03.500> 800<00:04:04.670> so<00:04:05.670> i<00:04:05.700> think<00:04:05.910> it's<00:04:06.030> a

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
battery in that is 800 so i think it's a

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.270 
battery in that is 800 so i think it's a
problem<00:04:06.270> of<00:04:06.660> this<00:04:06.959> can't<00:04:07.290> charge<00:04:07.709> the<00:04:07.950> battery

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
problem of this can't charge the battery

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.699 
problem of this can't charge the battery
fast<00:04:08.760> enough<00:04:09.120> or<00:04:09.330> would<00:04:09.750> take<00:04:10.020> all<00:04:10.260> night<00:04:10.500> to

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
fast enough or would take all night to

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:15.860 
fast enough or would take all night to
do<00:04:10.830> so<00:04:12.950> what<00:04:13.950> sucks<00:04:14.400> kinda<00:04:15.390> hoping<00:04:15.570> that<00:04:15.630> might

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
do so what sucks kinda hoping that might

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:16.509 
do so what sucks kinda hoping that might
work

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
work

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:20.569 
work
so<00:04:17.519> in<00:04:17.609> conclusion<00:04:19.130> unless<00:04:20.130> you<00:04:20.310> have<00:04:20.549> a

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
so in conclusion unless you have a

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.330 
so in conclusion unless you have a
really<00:04:21.060> big<00:04:21.269> bike<00:04:21.480> battery<00:04:21.950> and<00:04:22.950> a<00:04:23.160> really

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
really big bike battery and a really

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.880 
really big bike battery and a really
small<00:04:23.580> car<00:04:23.880> battery<00:04:24.240> no<00:04:24.810> it's<00:04:25.440> not<00:04:25.620> hit<00:04:25.800> my

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
small car battery no it's not hit my

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:30.230 
small car battery no it's not hit my
head<00:04:26.070> here<00:04:26.330> you<00:04:27.330> can't<00:04:27.690> jumpstart<00:04:28.410> a<00:04:28.680> car<00:04:29.240> with

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
head here you can't jumpstart a car with

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.470 
head here you can't jumpstart a car with
a<00:04:30.270> motorcycle<00:04:30.590> and<00:04:31.590> this<00:04:32.190> is<00:04:32.400> a<00:04:32.430> very<00:04:33.000> big<00:04:33.240> car
