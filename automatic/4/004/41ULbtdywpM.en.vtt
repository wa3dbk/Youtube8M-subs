information to hand out there sometimes
if<00:00:13.080> people<00:00:13.320> like<00:00:13.469> to<00:00:13.590> use<00:00:13.620> their<00:00:13.889> pedals

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:14.360 
if people like to use their pedals

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.849 
if people like to use their pedals
instead<00:00:15.360> of<00:00:15.450> using<00:00:15.630> a<00:00:15.809> battery<00:00:16.490> they<00:00:17.490> use<00:00:17.699> a

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:18.859 
instead of using a battery they use a

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:21.980 
instead of using a battery they use a
power<00:00:19.859> supply<00:00:20.210> well<00:00:21.210> it's<00:00:21.420> important<00:00:21.810> for<00:00:21.900> you

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
power supply well it's important for you

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.140 
power supply well it's important for you
to<00:00:22.050> know<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:23.510> power<00:00:24.510> supply<00:00:24.840> needs<00:00:25.619> to<00:00:25.800> match

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150 
to know the power supply needs to match

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.179 
to know the power supply needs to match
what<00:00:27.150> your<00:00:27.330> pedal

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:28.189 
what your pedal

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:33.580 
what your pedal
I'd<00:00:29.189> like<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.490> except<00:00:30.109> this<00:00:31.109> one<00:00:31.349> has<00:00:31.560> a

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 
I'd like to except this one has a

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.560 
I'd like to except this one has a
negative<00:00:34.590> pin<00:00:35.010> in<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.219> center<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:36.149> a

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
negative pin in the center and a

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.810 
negative pin in the center and a
positive<00:00:36.930> fit<00:00:37.110> positive<00:00:37.890> contact<00:00:38.579> on<00:00:38.730> the

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
positive fit positive contact on the

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.680 
positive fit positive contact on the
outside<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.660> it's<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.230> nine<00:00:40.410> volt<00:00:40.440> DC<00:00:41.690> there

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
outside and it's a nine volt DC there

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:43.490 
outside and it's a nine volt DC there
sorry<00:00:43.079> about<00:00:43.260> that

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500

this so this is what you don't want to

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.280 
this so this is what you don't want to
use<00:01:09.900> you<00:01:10.680> can<00:01:10.710> see<00:01:11.130> here<00:01:11.640> with<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.750> camera

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
use you can see here with the camera

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.980 
use you can see here with the camera
focus<00:01:13.880> that<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.720> outside<00:01:16.520> is<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.939> negative<00:01:18.570> and

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
focus that the outside is a negative and

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.520 
focus that the outside is a negative and
the<00:01:19.979> inside<00:01:20.400> is<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.850> positive<00:01:21.140> although<00:01:22.140> it

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
the inside is the positive although it

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.320 
the inside is the positive although it
is<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.680> nine<00:01:22.860> volt<00:01:22.890> DC<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.729> it's<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.939> hundred<00:01:24.180> and

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
is a nine volt DC and it's a hundred and

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.200 
is a nine volt DC and it's a hundred and
twenty<00:01:24.689> volts<00:01:25.220> this<00:01:26.220> will<00:01:26.520> not<00:01:26.700> work<00:01:26.729> this

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
twenty volts this will not work this

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.090 
twenty volts this will not work this
will<00:01:27.479> fry<00:01:27.810> your<00:01:28.350> pedal<00:01:30.049> this<00:01:31.049> on<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.950> other

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
will fry your pedal this on the other

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.219 
will fry your pedal this on the other
hand<00:01:32.369> is<00:01:32.700> what<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:33.630> want<00:01:35.509> okay<00:01:36.509> same<00:01:37.200> thing
