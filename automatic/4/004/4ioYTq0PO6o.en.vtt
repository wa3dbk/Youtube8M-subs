00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:07.819
 well it's not that we deserved it now 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:11.380
 yes we are going to finish it well but 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:11.380
 untangle it completely 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.840
 there is no damage left 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.470
 I personally recommend cutting the 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:28.259
 hair when we are already abusive 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.610
 so even if it hurts and for longer 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:31.910
 that is 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:35.850
 because it's no use keeping it that way 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:37.830
 when everything is already very damaged 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.510
 that are the split ends are not going to 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.980
 stop there will continue to grow 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.880
 before you will reach a point where you 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.400
 they're going to have really really hair 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:50.220
 unsightly and if you want to cut it 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.470
 The longer they take, the more drastic 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.410
 is going to have to be the change then 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:59.000
 now that since they notice that this one 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:02.480
 already insane 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:08.170
 I recommend cutting it or in this case 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.170
 put not to have what is a change 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:14.460
 I always said I prefer a hair 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.460
 healthy than a long hair 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.020
 you can apply this also you 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.649
 and ultimately for hair 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.649
 it always grows 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:34.399
 once we have studied it very well 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:40.049
 now we are going to tie it in the part 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:44.360
 back of the head and down 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.360
 above but here on the neck 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.549
 remember to pull everything completely 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.549
 backward 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.540
 so that they stay even 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.080
 ah 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.830
 we will adapt this first part 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.830
 very well 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.530
 which is the one that will hold the horse and 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.530
 the second part 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.640
 It is going to mark up where there was 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.640
 the cut 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.950
 once we have marked you well 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.069
 now if we bring the hair to the 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.069
 front 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.390
 ah 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:04.390
 and this is where we are going to cut so 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.390
 straight 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.259
 and this one 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.750
 and now yes 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:44.540
 hours indicates that I check and 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:47.020
 Until there they want it or if they want it still 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.020
 more room 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.210
 something like that would be remembered that the 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:02.800
 wet hair weighs more then it does not 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.349
 let yourself be carried by the length that tim 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.759
 habitat is best to dry them and so 

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:08.319
 can already check if and how 

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:10.360
 they want to return to mediaset and return to 

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:12.039
 cut but do not let yourself be guided only 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.469
 for the length of now because 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:17.110
 obviously it looks longer than it is 

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:19.479
 to stay when I know then this one 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.460
 so they will not cut the rest and 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:24.569
 well I'll wait for it to dry 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.569
 and now many results
