 bavaria and hamburg against dortmund the 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.629
 In the end, there are many teams 

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:08.140
 The view is rather down 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:10.660
 have to judge or completely after 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.410
 so stuttgart and 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.730
 hertha that is definitely times 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.170
 fight off if you see how the 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:18.820
 gone out to games are too 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.250
 Hanover is very bad at the 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.290
 last weeks very well bavaria dominates 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.600
 that's clear and dortmund is back 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.920
 on top 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.960
 hamburg he has to look down again 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:33.820
 let's see how it ends six posters 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:37.840

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:39.880
 is started that is kicked off 24 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:44.070
 Bundesliga match day at the pack lens 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:47.530
 play top trading cards Let's go 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:50.230
 and there we have lakic is second 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.030
 but played nothing loud 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.790
 relevant for the freiburg game day 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.750
 mehmedi is not that fresh either 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:00.280
 Frankfurter is therefore no 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.280
 relevant man or no relevant 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:06.690
 card but he has here in Derby has become 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.649
 as a quiet way he is so up 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.789
 It has to be instructed as I said 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.909
 he was on 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.859
 expected and he had picked up 

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:17.140
 to finish this for derby and his 

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:21.480
 henrik mkhitaryan skis 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:24.010
 dortmund with 0 1 in hamburg in the lead 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.260
 10 so now for dortmund by with 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.799
 Italy alexandrow is maxime 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.510
 stuttgarter and meets at home for 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:34.150
 stuttgart against herta very important goal 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:37.079
 if stuttgart still stay in the league 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.370
 wants 10 now for stuttgart by maxi 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:40.349
 booster number two next hour 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:45.129
 breaks 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:46.810
 and we start with sebastian rudy's 

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:49.180
 hoffheimer recording is not part of the 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.889
 today's thursday but thomas kraft 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.430
 is herthaner stuttgarts compensation 

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:56.250
 did not last long 1 1-balancing now 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.489
 Harder meets and we have one 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.470
 hattrick 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:01.450
 is Schnatterer is 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.329
 second division players therefore not relevant 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:07.269
 but now here winged allegory 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:09.400
 stocker hertha bsc is a winged pliers 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:11.739
 a full card the 10 2 gates 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.109
 stuttgart led 1 0 through maxim and 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.519
 is now suddenly 1 to 3 back completely 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:18.359
 bitter for stuttgart if so 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:21.790
 continue playing then the way is called 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:23.859
 second league arbitrary obraniak bremer 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.629
 bremen this part of the game and gladbach 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:28.449
 stadium in borussia park also not part 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:31.540
 the third day booster last 

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:34.599
 quarter of the first half the 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.400
 we start with jan kirchhoff schalke 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:38.470
 not part of the game day then 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.750
 a club card that of karlsruhe 2 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.099
 Of course, this is not part of the player 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.750
 and we have a hamburger that is 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:46.120
 dennis diekmeier and he compensates 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:49.389
 home for the hamburger against borussia 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.370
 dortmund as one to one so here too 

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:52.650
 now why so here leads harder 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.060
 the meanwhile 31 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.889
 augsburg's marwin hitz not only 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.840
 Goalkeeper is also a striker like you 

00:03:56.889 --> 00:04:01.569
 has not seen part of the game day 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.729
 and alex meier continues nature every tenth 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:05.650
 aria robben with frankfurt as well 

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:08.109
 not some plays as people that was the 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.949
 first half we look briefly what the 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:11.439
 say result 

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:13.419
 Stuttgart introduced 1 0 the 13 a whole 

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:15.280
 bitter result still scoreless and that 

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:17.979
 is a miracle hannover against the bavaria 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:21.400
 and a 1-1 draw goals 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:22.670
 vegetarians and diekmeier near hamburg 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.310
 against dortmund 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:26.680
 We start with a two-stroke booster number 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:29.240
 four 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.870
 I see the first hour will be 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.940
 and we have wolfsburg 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:37.730
 stress or wolfsburg not part of 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:39.620
 playsages dortmund is an early leader 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:41.690
 from the second half they come along 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:45.140
 very much elan marcel schmelzer the 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:47.150
 meets infrequently but today does 1 to 2 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:49.550
 So now for borussia dortmund in 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.890
 Hamburg and now the absolute grenades 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:55.100
 star marcelo you would not have it anymore 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:56.990
 Opportunities 1 to 0 for Hanover 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.120
 the last weeks so bad 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.490
 looked against the bavaria 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.230
 Johann Geis is the champion is not part 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.280
 of the day as little as kevin 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:08.330
 Faulk we go to the next one 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:11.680
 quarter of the second half and 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:14.480
 these with kevin de bruyne the 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.590
 topscorer of the league maybe that is 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.150
 not quite because there are still 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:19.160
 At least he lays the arjen robben 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:22.100
 Most gates before wolfsburg but not 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:24.620
 days later harder destroyed stuttgart 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:28.370
 then finally it is now 1 to 4 goal 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:30.800
 by sebastian langkamp we have 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:33.320
 here a defensive duo of freiburg 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.720
 freiburg does not share spielag paderborn 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:38.060
 not days later and cologne does not crack 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:40.790
 there played tags last quarter of an hour 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.770
 of the 24th game day on top trading cards 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:45.800
 impact if he plays the last game 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:47.420
 It's still possible everywhere 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.900
 what happen only stuttgart is belief 

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:52.850
 I'm right on the ass dÃ¼sseldorf / 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:56.330
 Dusseldorf second is not part of the 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:58.340
 schoollag donati studio is leverkusener 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.510
 leverkusen in detail spielags and man 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.850
 hardly believe it 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:03.950
 that's the only thing with the pacolli 

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:06.740
 keep playing something sagging for 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:09.350
 hannover and makes the 2 0 at home 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:11.870
 against the bavaria so i would be at yours 

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.190
 tell the betting man euro to 1 2 0 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:15.410
 for hannover against bavaria 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:17.780
 there you can get out money 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:21.680
 of course the chance says it happens 1 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:24.100
 to have 4 billion so from freiburg 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:26.090
 we a matchwinner admir mehmedi 

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:27.710
 freiburg but not all spielag 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:30.530
 as well as Eintracht frankfurt 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:34.430
 own and therefore it is over now 

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:36.080
 here comes the apple and the 24 months 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.340

 end results to stuttgart leads 1 0 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:43.849
 looks great then breaks completely 

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.349
 as you know it from one to 

00:06:43.849 --> 00:06:48.770
 much at the end loses at home against 

00:06:45.349 --> 00:06:50.750
 hertha surprisingly wins 

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:53.930
 Hanover at home against Bayern 2 0 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:56.240
 gates of marcelo and akai and dortmund 

00:06:53.930 --> 00:07:00.139

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:02.210
 in succession one to two away in 

00:07:00.139 --> 00:07:04.669
 hamburg gates diekmeier for hamburg and 

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:07.159
