this<00:00:39.480> one<00:00:39.750> we<00:00:40.350> will<00:00:40.530> drive<00:00:40.829> with<00:00:41.039> two<00:00:41.070> electric

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
this one we will drive with two electric

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.529 
this one we will drive with two electric
engines<00:00:41.940> each<00:00:42.329> 45<00:00:42.960> kilo<00:00:43.170> its<00:00:43.379> power<00:00:43.590> give<00:00:44.539> you

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
engines each 45 kilo its power give you

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.349 
engines each 45 kilo its power give you
lots<00:00:45.780> of<00:00:45.870> power<00:00:46.640> so<00:00:47.640> it's<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:47.850> completely

00:00:48.349 --> 00:00:48.359 
lots of power so it's a completely

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:50.569 
lots of power so it's a completely

give you out on imme of about up to 250

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.110 
give you out on imme of about up to 250
kilometers

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:23.120 
kilometers

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.810 
kilometers
that<00:01:23.750> would<00:01:23.900> be<00:01:24.020> in<00:01:24.080> miles<00:01:24.320> around<00:01:24.590> 150<00:01:25.580> months

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
that would be in miles around 150 months

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.320 
that would be in miles around 150 months
yes<00:01:26.770> okay<00:01:27.770> so<00:01:27.830> in<00:01:28.400> order<00:01:28.520> to<00:01:28.790> get<00:01:29.000> that<00:01:29.150> I've

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
yes okay so in order to get that I've

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:30.730 
yes okay so in order to get that I've
told<00:01:29.510> them<00:01:29.630> you<00:01:29.750> have<00:01:29.960> to<00:01:30.110> fully<00:01:30.320> charge<00:01:30.410> the

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
told them you have to fully charge the

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.220 
told them you have to fully charge the
battery<00:01:30.860> what<00:01:31.490> is<00:01:31.640> the<00:01:31.790> time<00:01:32.000> for<00:01:32.300> Barry<00:01:32.840> to<00:01:32.960> be

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:33.230 
battery what is the time for Barry to be

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:35.320 
battery what is the time for Barry to be
fully<00:01:33.470> charged<00:01:33.830> standard<00:01:34.220> outlet<00:01:34.400> here<00:01:35.120> it's

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
fully charged standard outlet here it's

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.960 
fully charged standard outlet here it's
about<00:01:35.720> 6<00:01:36.230> to<00:01:36.350> 8<00:01:36.440> hours<00:01:36.680> so<00:01:37.130> let's<00:01:37.340> say<00:01:37.520> 8<00:01:37.760> hours

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
about 6 to 8 hours so let's say 8 hours

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:47.760 
about 6 to 8 hours so let's say 8 hours
to<00:01:38.300> be<00:01:38.420> certain<00:01:40.870> any<00:01:41.870> information<00:01:42.470> on<00:01:42.560> a<00:01:42.590> quick

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:55.350 

charge<00:01:51.790> up<00:01:52.790> to<00:01:52.850> 3<00:01:53.210> hours<00:01:53.360> up<00:01:53.990> to<00:01:54.170> 3<00:01:54.350> hours<00:01:54.380> ok

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
charge up to 3 hours up to 3 hours ok

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.880 
charge up to 3 hours up to 3 hours ok
will<00:01:56.360> you<00:01:56.390> please<00:01:56.690> show<00:01:56.900> me<00:01:57.080> how<00:01:57.230> to<00:01:57.410> open<00:01:57.650> the

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
will you please show me how to open the

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:07.330 
will you please show me how to open the
door<00:02:05.050> it's<00:02:06.050> not<00:02:06.170> be<00:02:06.290> very<00:02:06.470> usual<00:02:06.680> especially

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
door it's not be very usual especially

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.820 
door it's not be very usual especially
for<00:02:07.490> the<00:02:07.580> small<00:02:07.760> card<00:02:08.030> no<00:02:08.540> but<00:02:08.929> we<00:02:09.500> like<00:02:09.679> it

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
for the small card no but we like it

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.010 
for the small card no but we like it
because<00:02:10.130> it<00:02:10.429> actually<00:02:10.550> uses<00:02:10.940> less<00:02:11.510> space<00:02:11.810> than

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
because it actually uses less space than

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.770 
because it actually uses less space than
a<00:02:12.080> conventional<00:02:12.320> door<00:02:12.890> opening<00:02:13.280> system<00:02:13.580> so<00:02:14.540> it

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
a conventional door opening system so it

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.160 
a conventional door opening system so it
uses<00:02:15.050> about<00:02:15.410> 62<00:02:15.860> centimeters<00:02:16.840> from<00:02:17.840> the<00:02:17.930> side

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
uses about 62 centimeters from the side

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.170 
uses about 62 centimeters from the side
of<00:02:18.320> the<00:02:18.440> car<00:02:18.620> so<00:02:18.920> we<00:02:19.190> are<00:02:19.520> also<00:02:19.790> in<00:02:20.090> the

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
of the car so we are also in the

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.760 
of the car so we are also in the
standard<00:02:20.570> of<00:02:20.920> garages<00:02:21.920> which<00:02:22.220> it's<00:02:22.400> 2.35<00:02:23.240> so

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
standard of garages which it's 2.35 so

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:30.699 
standard of garages which it's 2.35 so
if<00:02:24.770> you<00:02:24.920> say<00:02:28.239> where<00:02:29.239> is<00:02:29.270> this<00:02:29.480> car<00:02:29.690> made<00:02:29.959> it's

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
if you say where is this car made it's

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.460 
if you say where is this car made it's
made<00:02:30.860> in<00:02:31.010> Croatia<00:02:31.480> in<00:02:32.480> our<00:02:33.050> production

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
made in Croatia in our production

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.650 
made in Croatia in our production
facility<00:02:33.980> which<00:02:34.190> are<00:02:34.430> used<00:02:34.670> to<00:02:34.970> produce<00:02:35.450> the

facility which are used to produce the
core<00:02:35.959> business<00:02:36.110> machines<00:02:37.070> so<00:02:37.489> it's<00:02:37.700> the

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
core business machines so it's the
