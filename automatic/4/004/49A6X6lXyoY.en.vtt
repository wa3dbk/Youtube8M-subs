make the timing for this next part

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.670 
make the timing for this next part
really<00:00:55.350> good<00:00:56.090> it<00:00:57.090> makes<00:00:57.300> it<00:00:57.480> easy<00:00:58.109> for<00:00:58.320> both

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
really good it makes it easy for both

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.540

parts<00:00:59.239> so<00:01:00.239> this<00:01:00.390> part<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:00.840> want<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.140> jump<00:01:01.550> back

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
parts so this part you want to jump back

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.700 
parts so this part you want to jump back
and<00:01:02.760> forth<00:01:02.820> off<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.359> wall<00:01:03.539> just<00:01:04.350> to<00:01:04.439> avoid

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
and forth off the wall just to avoid

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.340 
and forth off the wall just to avoid
getting<00:01:04.890> hit<00:01:05.189> by<00:01:05.339> that<00:01:05.369> rocket<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.780> then

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
getting hit by that rocket and then

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.899 
getting hit by that rocket and then
dodge<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:07.770> on<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.010> right<00:01:08.159> side<00:01:08.400> so<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:08.700> shoots

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
dodge it on the right side so it shoots

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.670 
dodge it on the right side so it shoots
one<00:01:09.090> at<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.270> wall<00:01:09.450> gives<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.320> little<00:01:10.560> bit

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
one at the wall gives you a little bit

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.730 
one at the wall gives you a little bit
of<00:01:10.770> leeway<00:01:10.920> with<00:01:11.189> this<00:01:11.369> part<00:01:11.640> and<00:01:12.500> then<00:01:13.500> just

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
of leeway with this part and then just

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.880 
of leeway with this part and then just
dodge<00:01:14.159> those<00:01:14.460> best<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:14.970> can<00:01:15.150> or<00:01:15.479> is<00:01:16.409> best<00:01:16.710> you

these and the doors all the way at the

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.550 
these and the doors all the way at the

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
top so you're gonna want to repeat the

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.620 
top so you're gonna want to repeat the
first<00:01:55.770> thing<00:01:56.070> you<00:01:56.189> did<00:01:56.340> by<00:01:56.820> jumping<00:01:57.270> off<00:01:57.329> this

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
first thing you did by jumping off this

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:04.429 
first thing you did by jumping off this
side<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.710> then<00:01:58.860> up<00:01:59.390> and<00:02:00.390> then<00:02:01.310> make<00:02:02.310> it<00:02:03.439> circle

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
side and then up and then make it circle

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.559 
side and then up and then make it circle
you<00:02:04.530> until<00:02:04.830> the<00:02:05.009> timings<00:02:05.479> generally<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.600> same

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
you until the timings generally the same

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.320 
you until the timings generally the same
and<00:02:09.569> this<00:02:10.410> rocket<00:02:10.769> is<00:02:10.860> not<00:02:11.459> leaving<00:02:11.849> me<00:02:11.970> alone

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
and this rocket is not leaving me alone

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.330 
and this rocket is not leaving me alone
oh<00:02:12.599> my<00:02:13.230> god<00:02:14.989> followed<00:02:15.989> me<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.200> whole<00:02:16.350> way<00:02:16.500> all

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
oh my god followed me the whole way all

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.580 
oh my god followed me the whole way all
right<00:02:17.549> but<00:02:17.819> that's<00:02:18.000> generally<00:02:18.590> basically

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
right but that's generally basically

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.300 
right but that's generally basically
what<00:02:19.709> you<00:02:19.799> do<00:02:20.780> this<00:02:21.780> next<00:02:22.110> one<00:02:22.350> is<00:02:22.739> kind<00:02:23.160> of

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
what you do this next one is kind of

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.870 
what you do this next one is kind of
tedious<00:02:23.489> I<00:02:23.970> don't<00:02:24.480> like<00:02:24.600> it

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
tedious I don't like it

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.259 
tedious I don't like it
you<00:02:26.880> can<00:02:27.650> jump<00:02:28.650> and<00:02:29.069> get<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.370> top<00:02:29.700> ones<00:02:29.970> right

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
you can jump and get the top ones right

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:32.570 
you can jump and get the top ones right
away<00:02:30.510> just<00:02:30.750> like<00:02:31.049> that<00:02:31.290> you<00:02:32.040> can<00:02:32.160> do<00:02:32.250> that<00:02:32.370> for

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
away just like that you can do that for

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.320 
away just like that you can do that for
everyone<00:02:32.970> but<00:02:33.510> you're<00:02:33.690> gonna<00:02:34.049> miss<00:02:34.290> a<00:02:34.349> couple

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
everyone but you're gonna miss a couple

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.360 
everyone but you're gonna miss a couple
unless<00:02:36.330> you<00:02:36.510> like<00:02:36.630> to<00:02:36.660> master<00:02:37.230> this<00:02:37.410> which<00:02:38.250> I

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
unless you like to master this which I

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.030 
unless you like to master this which I
haven't<00:02:38.640> done

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.250 

I<00:02:43.129> usually<00:02:43.670> missed<00:02:44.000> the<00:02:44.150> second<00:02:44.510> one<00:02:44.629> just

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
I usually missed the second one just

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.780 
I usually missed the second one just
because<00:02:45.409> it's<00:02:45.530> farther<00:02:45.739> away

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:57.649 

this<00:02:51.329> pop<00:02:51.629> art<00:02:51.900> is<00:02:52.049> really<00:02:52.439> tricky<00:02:55.640> well<00:02:56.659> it's

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:57.659 
this pop art is really tricky well it's

00:02:57.659 --> 00:02:59.420 
this pop art is really tricky well it's
probably<00:02:58.079> not<00:02:58.200> as<00:02:58.439> tricky<00:02:58.769> as<00:02:58.799> I<00:02:58.980> make<00:02:59.189> it<00:02:59.340> out

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
probably not as tricky as I make it out

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.929 
probably not as tricky as I make it out
to<00:02:59.489> be

00:02:59.929 --> 00:02:59.939 
to be

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:02.569 
to be
but<00:03:00.450> I<00:03:00.480> have<00:03:00.900> trouble<00:03:01.109> with<00:03:01.349> it<00:03:01.500> so<00:03:01.769> it's

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
but I have trouble with it so it's

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:06.289

kind<00:04:48.960> of<00:04:49.050> really<00:04:49.650> nifty<00:04:49.860> little<00:04:50.130> way<00:04:50.310> to<00:04:50.340> get

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
kind of really nifty little way to get

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.900 
kind of really nifty little way to get
up<00:04:50.669> there<00:04:50.699> just<00:04:51.180> wall<00:04:51.539> jump<00:04:51.840> up<00:04:52.020> and<00:04:52.550> I<00:04:53.550> didn't

up there just wall jump up and I didn't

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.240 
up there just wall jump up and I didn't
do<00:04:54.000> it<00:04:54.090> that<00:04:54.120> good<00:04:54.419> that<00:04:54.570> time<00:04:54.710> so<00:04:55.710> hopefully

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
do it that good that time so hopefully

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.679 
do it that good that time so hopefully
I'll<00:04:56.340> get<00:04:56.460> it<00:04:56.580> this<00:04:56.699> time

00:05:00.679 --> 00:05:00.689 

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:03.409 

I<00:05:00.799> might<00:05:01.799> sound<00:05:02.039> like<00:05:02.159> I'm<00:05:02.339> talking<00:05:02.729> bastard
