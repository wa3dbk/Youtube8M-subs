00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
sage I felt like I wasn't attacking with

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.350 
sage I felt like I wasn't attacking with
it<00:01:08.159> really<00:01:08.369> wasn't<00:01:08.580> doing<00:01:08.729> much<00:01:08.820> damage<00:01:08.880> just

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
it really wasn't doing much damage just

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.240 
it really wasn't doing much damage just
using<00:01:09.659> it<00:01:09.750> for<00:01:09.900> mana<00:01:10.110> even<00:01:10.500> if<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:10.650> like<00:01:11.040> if<00:01:11.159> I

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
using it for mana even if I like if I

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.969 
using it for mana even if I like if I
did<00:01:11.490> do<00:01:11.580> that<00:01:11.610> so<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.510> wanted<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.350> do<00:01:13.590> a<00:01:13.619> little

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
did do that so I wanted to do a little

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.789 
did do that so I wanted to do a little
bit<00:01:14.159> more<00:01:14.340> than<00:01:14.850> just<00:01:14.880> add<00:01:15.150> mana<00:01:15.420> so<00:01:15.960> this<00:01:16.650> is<00:01:16.680> a

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
bit more than just add mana so this is a

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.010 
bit more than just add mana so this is a
great<00:01:17.009> addition<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.490> deck<00:01:17.790> he<00:01:18.780> seems

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
great addition to the deck he seems

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.600

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
really good so we'll see how it goes

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.210 
really good so we'll see how it goes
moving<00:01:23.610> right<00:01:23.640> along<00:01:23.869> we<00:01:24.869> have<00:01:25.110> our<00:01:25.439> balance

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220
