tell there are a lot of folks here with

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.089 
tell there are a lot of folks here with
advanced<00:00:10.690> micro<00:00:10.990> devices<00:00:11.019> we're<00:00:11.860> just<00:00:11.980> here

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:12.099 
advanced micro devices we're just here

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:14.220 
advanced micro devices we're just here
to<00:00:12.580> basically<00:00:12.820> have<00:00:13.299> fun<00:00:13.540> this<00:00:13.719> is<00:00:13.870> the<00:00:13.990> first

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:14.230 
to basically have fun this is the first

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:15.959 
to basically have fun this is the first
time<00:00:14.500> we've<00:00:14.920> done<00:00:15.129> this<00:00:15.160> this<00:00:15.460> is<00:00:15.610> the<00:00:15.759> first

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:15.969 
time we've done this this is the first

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:18.090 
time we've done this this is the first
time<00:00:16.120> we've<00:00:16.330> shown<00:00:16.570> off<00:00:16.750> dragon<00:00:17.590> in<00:00:17.710> public

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:18.100 
time we've shown off dragon in public

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.429 
time we've shown off dragon in public
and<00:00:18.330> we<00:00:19.330> thought<00:00:19.539> we'd<00:00:19.689> have<00:00:19.840> some<00:00:19.869> fun<00:00:20.260> by

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:20.439 
and we thought we'd have some fun by

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:21.900 
and we thought we'd have some fun by
showing<00:00:20.769> it<00:00:20.890> off<00:00:20.980> to<00:00:21.010> some<00:00:21.369> folks<00:00:21.550> who<00:00:21.699> care

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:21.910 
showing it off to some folks who care

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.089 
showing it off to some folks who care
I'm<00:00:22.390> here<00:00:22.660> to<00:00:22.750> see<00:00:22.930> the<00:00:23.050> new<00:00:23.170> chip<00:00:23.439> see<00:00:23.769> how<00:00:23.949> it

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:24.099 
I'm here to see the new chip see how it

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:26.820 
I'm here to see the new chip see how it
runs<00:00:24.250> under<00:00:24.730> normal<00:00:25.080> conditions<00:00:26.080> how<00:00:26.500> far<00:00:26.710> you

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:26.830 
runs under normal conditions how far you

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.279 
runs under normal conditions how far you
can<00:00:26.980> push<00:00:27.010> it<00:00:27.220> obviously<00:00:27.760> interested<00:00:28.630> to<00:00:28.960> see

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:29.289 
can push it obviously interested to see

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:31.380 
can push it obviously interested to see
what<00:00:29.800> the<00:00:29.920> Phenom<00:00:30.220> suit<00:00:30.550> you<00:00:30.939> know<00:00:31.060> can<00:00:31.240> do

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:31.390 
what the Phenom suit you know can do

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:32.609 
what the Phenom suit you know can do
there's<00:00:31.869> a<00:00:31.929> number<00:00:32.410> of<00:00:32.529> different

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:32.619 
there's a number of different

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:34.740 
there's a number of different
demonstrations<00:00:33.370> with<00:00:34.000> computers<00:00:34.570> that<00:00:34.690> are

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:34.750 
demonstrations with computers that are

demonstrations with computers that are
being<00:00:34.930> overclocked<00:00:35.410> in<00:00:35.590> different<00:00:35.860> ways

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:35.950 
being overclocked in different ways

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.130 
being overclocked in different ways
there's<00:00:36.370> a<00:00:36.430> setup<00:00:37.060> where<00:00:37.180> you<00:00:37.270> can<00:00:37.420> see<00:00:37.600> the

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.140 
there's a setup where you can see the

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.260 
there's a setup where you can see the
result<00:00:38.860> with<00:00:39.040> air<00:00:39.310> cooling<00:00:39.670> you<00:00:39.880> can<00:00:40.030> see<00:00:40.180> the

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:40.270 
result with air cooling you can see the

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.060 
result with air cooling you can see the
result<00:00:40.600> with<00:00:41.110> water<00:00:41.350> cooling<00:00:41.740> you<00:00:41.800> can<00:00:41.920> see

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070 
result with water cooling you can see

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:42.930 
result with water cooling you can see
what<00:00:42.220> they're<00:00:42.340> doing<00:00:42.550> with<00:00:42.640> liquid<00:00:42.910> nitrogen

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
what they're doing with liquid nitrogen

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.570 
what they're doing with liquid nitrogen
which<00:00:43.810> is<00:00:43.960> obviously<00:00:44.290> for<00:00:44.590> fun<00:00:44.770> but<00:00:45.070> it's<00:00:45.220> it's

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:45.580 
which is obviously for fun but it's it's

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:49.080 
which is obviously for fun but it's it's

there<00:01:05.950> it<00:01:06.010> is<00:01:06.100> six<00:01:06.580> kickers<00:01:07.000> I<00:01:07.270> think<00:01:07.660> you've

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
there it is six kickers I think you've

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.120 
there it is six kickers I think you've
got<00:01:07.900> a<00:01:07.930> little<00:01:08.110> bit<00:01:08.290> more<00:01:08.410> left<00:01:08.590> right<00:01:08.800> ya

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
got a little bit more left right ya

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.100 
got a little bit more left right ya
think<00:01:09.430> we<00:01:09.520> got<00:01:09.700> a<00:01:09.730> little<00:01:09.820> more<00:01:09.970> about<00:01:10.630> 61

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
think we got a little more about 61

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.170 
think we got a little more about 61
folks<00:01:12.060> 62

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
folks 62

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.969 
folks 62
6-3<00:01:15.180> 6-3<00:01:15.930> everybody<00:01:18.770> it<00:01:19.770> was<00:01:19.950> very

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
6-3 6-3 everybody it was very

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.250 
6-3 6-3 everybody it was very
interesting<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.820> see<00:01:20.970> how<00:01:21.180> that<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.990> worked

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:22.260 
interesting to see how that it worked

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.120 
interesting to see how that it worked
and<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:23.070> processor<00:01:23.670> was<00:01:23.880> running<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:25.130> quite

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
and the processor was running it quite

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.859 
and the processor was running it quite
an<00:01:26.250> awesome<00:01:26.610> frequency<00:01:27.090> I<00:01:27.300> mean<00:01:27.570> if<00:01:27.690> you<00:01:27.780> were

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
an awesome frequency I mean if you were

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.990 
an awesome frequency I mean if you were
to<00:01:27.990> supply<00:01:28.229> that<00:01:28.260> an<00:01:28.560> Intel<00:01:29.070> processor<00:01:29.100> and

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
to supply that an Intel processor and

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.390 
to supply that an Intel processor and
then<00:01:30.210> probably<00:01:30.600> fri<00:01:30.840> graphics<00:01:31.830> quality<00:01:31.920> looks

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
then probably fri graphics quality looks

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.850 
then probably fri graphics quality looks
great<00:01:32.640> look<00:01:33.000> smooth<00:01:33.330> in<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.440> comparison

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
great look smooth in the comparison

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.430 
great look smooth in the comparison
versus<00:01:35.340> Intel<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:36.150> average<00:01:36.810> frame<00:01:37.110> rate<00:01:37.290> was

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
versus Intel the average frame rate was

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.080 
versus Intel the average frame rate was
about<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.800> same<00:01:38.009> but<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.430> minimum<00:01:38.729> frame

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
about the same but the minimum frame

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.350 
about the same but the minimum frame
rate<00:01:39.360> was<00:01:39.600> about<00:01:39.810> twice<00:01:40.619> on<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.040> AMD<00:01:41.880> platform

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
rate was about twice on the AMD platform

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.120 
rate was about twice on the AMD platform
as<00:01:42.509> it<00:01:42.630> was<00:01:42.750> on<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.990> Intel<00:01:43.259> platform<00:01:43.770> so

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
as it was on the Intel platform so

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.969 
as it was on the Intel platform so
that's<00:01:44.550> a<00:01:44.940> huge<00:01:45.060> plus<00:01:45.509> there<00:01:46.259> was<00:01:46.350> one<00:01:46.410> dem<00:01:46.800> one

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
that's a huge plus there was one dem one

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.910 
that's a huge plus there was one dem one
that<00:01:47.100> does<00:01:47.310> compared<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.690> i7<00:01:49.440> that<00:01:49.680> just

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
that does compared to the i7 that just

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.889 
that does compared to the i7 that just
recently<00:01:50.070> released<00:01:50.369> by<00:01:50.670> Intel<00:01:51.060> very<00:01:51.450> nice<00:01:51.690> to

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
recently released by Intel very nice to

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.840 
recently released by Intel very nice to
see<00:01:52.050> that<00:01:52.080> that's<00:01:52.470> pretty<00:01:53.070> comparable<00:01:53.550> and

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
see that that's pretty comparable and

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.790 
see that that's pretty comparable and
they<00:01:54.119> do<00:01:54.180> agree<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.690> price<00:01:54.899> difference<00:01:55.170> huge

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
they do agree the price difference huge

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.060 
they do agree the price difference huge
the<00:01:56.250> price<00:01:56.630> and<00:01:57.630> performance<00:01:57.750> I<00:01:58.320> think<00:01:58.680> AMD

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
the price and performance I think AMD
