oblivion<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.350> that's<00:01:46.979> because<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.490> has

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
oblivion and that's because it has

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.300 
oblivion and that's because it has
pressure<00:01:47.970> points<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.600> opportunist<00:01:49.590> and<00:01:49.860> then

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
pressure points and opportunist and then

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.740 
pressure points and opportunist and then
after<00:01:50.729> that<00:01:50.880> you're<00:01:51.060> going<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:51.360> need<00:01:51.479> one

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
after that you're going to need one

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.260 
after that you're going to need one
other<00:01:51.930> piece<00:01:52.259> that<00:01:52.920> way<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.340> X<00:01:53.490> oblivion<00:01:54.000> will

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
other piece that way the X oblivion will

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.569 
other piece that way the X oblivion will
add<00:01:54.479> pressure<00:01:54.869> points<00:01:55.409> so<00:01:56.070> we<00:01:56.219> went<00:01:56.460> with<00:01:56.490> the

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
add pressure points so we went with the

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.850 
add pressure points so we went with the
no<00:01:56.880> mercy<00:01:57.299> for<00:01:57.509> some<00:01:57.719> additional<00:01:57.990> attack<00:01:58.530> at

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
no mercy for some additional attack at

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.319 
no mercy for some additional attack at
this<00:01:59.250> point<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.700> only<00:01:59.909> thing<00:02:00.000> that

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
this point the only thing that

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.730 
this point the only thing that
potentially<00:02:00.840> stands<00:02:01.140> in<00:02:01.290> our<00:02:01.409> way<00:02:01.439> is<00:02:01.710> the

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
potentially stands in our way is the

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.889 
potentially stands in our way is the
agent<00:02:02.340> casting<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:02.939> light<00:02:03.090> fantastic

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.510 
or any other debuff removal for that
matter<00:02:06.329> so<00:02:06.899> with<00:02:07.200> anti-venom<00:02:07.860> it's<00:02:08.190> great

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520

quick action gadget would work out as

points<00:03:17.850> the<00:03:18.510> only<00:03:18.840> problem<00:03:19.230> is<00:03:19.350> we<00:03:19.560> only<00:03:19.590> have

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
points the only problem is we only have

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.040 
points the only problem is we only have
four<00:03:20.190> equipment<00:03:20.670> slots<00:03:20.820> but<00:03:21.480> honestly<00:03:22.019> I

four equipment slots but honestly I

oh<00:03:24.209> well<00:03:24.810> maybe<00:03:25.050> we<00:03:25.260> will<00:03:25.560> next<00:03:25.950> time<00:03:26.130> but<00:03:26.670> now

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
oh well maybe we will next time but now

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.360 
oh well maybe we will next time but now
with<00:03:27.180> my<00:03:27.420> agent<00:03:27.989> since<00:03:28.500> we<00:03:28.680> have<00:03:28.860> doom<00:03:29.130> I'm

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
with my agent since we have doom I'm

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.370 
with my agent since we have doom I'm
probably<00:03:29.640> going<00:03:30.060> to<00:03:30.180> have<00:03:30.300> to<00:03:30.330> rest<00:03:30.720> this<00:03:31.320> is

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
probably going to have to rest this is

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.410 
probably going to have to rest this is
going<00:03:31.739> to<00:03:31.860> slow<00:03:32.070> down<00:03:32.100> our<00:03:32.310> setup<00:03:32.790> slightly

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
going to slow down our setup slightly

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.600 
going to slow down our setup slightly
but<00:03:34.140> we<00:03:34.290> still<00:03:34.560> should<00:03:34.769> be<00:03:34.800> able<00:03:34.980> to<00:03:35.130> use<00:03:35.220> the<00:03:35.400> X

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
but we still should be able to use the X

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.970 
but we still should be able to use the X
oblivion<00:03:36.150> before<00:03:36.510> Nova<00:03:36.930> second<00:03:37.470> turn<00:03:37.680> and

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
oblivion before Nova second turn and

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.979 
oblivion before Nova second turn and
that's<00:03:38.519> really<00:03:38.790> all<00:03:39.120> that<00:03:39.150> matters

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
that's really all that matters

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.470 
that's really all that matters
so<00:03:40.560> with<00:03:40.800> anti<00:03:41.250> Venom's<00:03:41.610> first<00:03:41.910> turn<00:03:42.209> we're

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
so with anti Venom's first turn we're

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.900 
so with anti Venom's first turn we're
going<00:03:42.690> to<00:03:42.780> use<00:03:42.930> I<00:03:43.200> am<00:03:43.350> The<00:03:43.500> Cure<00:03:43.739> and<00:03:44.040> hopefully

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
going to use I am The Cure and hopefully

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.460 
going to use I am The Cure and hopefully
we<00:03:45.060> can<00:03:45.090> place<00:03:45.390> the<00:03:45.570> power<00:03:45.780> on<00:03:45.959> a<00:03:45.989> few<00:03:46.290> of<00:03:46.350> those

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
we can place the power on a few of those

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.949 
we can place the power on a few of those
enemies<00:03:46.950> you<00:03:47.640> have<00:03:47.880> to<00:03:48.060> love<00:03:48.209> that<00:03:48.269> level<00:03:48.780> too

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
enemies you have to love that level too

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.080 
enemies you have to love that level too
because<00:03:49.350> it<00:03:49.500> heavily<00:03:49.890> debuffs<00:03:50.489> the<00:03:50.670> enemy

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
because it heavily debuffs the enemy

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.180 
because it heavily debuffs the enemy
team<00:03:51.330> and<00:03:51.600> it<00:03:52.080> definitely<00:03:52.590> takes<00:03:52.799> some<00:03:52.950> of<00:03:53.070> the

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
team and it definitely takes some of the

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.460 
team and it definitely takes some of the
sting<00:03:53.220> out<00:03:53.580> gamora's<00:03:54.090> counter<00:03:54.570> then<00:03:55.080> since

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
sting out gamora's counter then since

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.979 
sting out gamora's counter then since
the<00:03:55.650> enemy<00:03:55.830> agent<00:03:56.370> was<00:03:56.580> exhausted<00:03:57.299> he<00:03:57.690> only

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
the enemy agent was exhausted he only

00:03:57.989 --> 00:03:59.690 
the enemy agent was exhausted he only
could<00:03:58.110> use<00:03:58.320> the<00:03:58.500> Guardian<00:03:58.890> insignia<00:03:59.370> on<00:03:59.549> his

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
could use the Guardian insignia on his

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.030 
could use the Guardian insignia on his
turn<00:03:59.970> also<00:04:00.870> it<00:04:00.930> allows<00:04:01.170> us<00:04:01.200> to<00:04:01.530> attack<00:04:01.830> those

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
turn also it allows us to attack those

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.920 
turn also it allows us to attack those

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.070 
and then we're going to use Nova punches

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.969 
and then we're going to use Nova punches
on<00:05:53.250> the<00:05:53.370> enemy<00:05:53.759> agent<00:05:54.240> it<00:05:55.080> does<00:05:55.349> nice<00:05:55.620> damage

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:55.979

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:57.870 
but unfortunately this time it doesn't

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.200 
but unfortunately this time it doesn't
crit<00:05:58.289> and<00:05:58.440> since<00:05:59.219> it<00:05:59.340> has<00:05:59.370> deadly<00:05:59.940> crits

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:00.210 
crit and since it has deadly crits

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:01.249 
crit and since it has deadly crits
though<00:06:00.360> it's<00:06:00.479> going<00:06:00.630> to<00:06:00.719> make<00:06:00.840> a<00:06:00.870> big

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:01.259 
though it's going to make a big

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:03.559 
though it's going to make a big
difference<00:06:01.710> in<00:06:01.860> total<00:06:02.069> damage<00:06:02.639> so<00:06:03.180> if<00:06:03.300> you<00:06:03.419> can

00:06:03.559 --> 00:06:03.569 
difference in total damage so if you can

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:05.390 
difference in total damage so if you can
make<00:06:03.690> it<00:06:03.810> a<00:06:03.900> guaranteed<00:06:04.349> crit<00:06:04.650> you<00:06:04.770> definitely

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 
make it a guaranteed crit you definitely

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.550 
make it a guaranteed crit you definitely
should<00:06:05.699> and<00:06:06.000> that<00:06:06.509> will<00:06:06.719> make<00:06:06.870> it<00:06:07.020> a<00:06:07.080> one-shot

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560 
should and that will make it a one-shot

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.219 
should and that will make it a one-shot
