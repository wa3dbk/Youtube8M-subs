00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:37.900 
and if you try the password more than

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.920 
and if you try the password more than
three<00:00:38.199> times<00:00:38.410> it<00:00:38.769> just<00:00:38.800> reboots<00:00:39.489> and<00:00:39.930> we're

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:40.930 
three times it just reboots and we're

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
reset the password on the back and you

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.140 
reset the password on the back and you
flip<00:00:50.080> your<00:00:50.229> Toshiba<00:00:50.710> over<00:00:51.070> you're<00:00:51.879> going<00:00:52.059> to

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.150 
flip your Toshiba over you're going to

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.030 
flip your Toshiba over you're going to
remove<00:00:52.420> the<00:00:52.750> battery<00:00:52.930> door<00:00:53.320> I'm<00:00:53.500> sorry<00:00:53.710> beet

battery<00:00:54.729> then<00:00:55.390> you're<00:00:55.540> going<00:00:55.720> to<00:00:55.839> remove<00:00:56.199> the

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
battery then you're going to remove the

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.780 
battery then you're going to remove the
door<00:00:57.519> that<00:00:57.790> exposes<00:00:58.479> the<00:00:58.750> RAM<00:00:59.080> memory<00:00:59.670> and<00:01:00.670> the

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:00.790 
door that exposes the RAM memory and the

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.189 
door that exposes the RAM memory and the
Wi-Fi<00:01:01.210> cards<00:01:01.690> there

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:02.199 
Wi-Fi cards there

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:03.960 
Wi-Fi cards there
then<00:01:02.799> the<00:01:02.979> next<00:01:03.159> thing<00:01:03.309> you're<00:01:03.489> going<00:01:03.670> to<00:01:03.820> do

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:03.970 
then the next thing you're going to do

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.460 
then the next thing you're going to do
is<00:01:04.150> you're<00:01:04.330> going<00:01:04.510> to<00:01:04.659> pop<00:01:05.140> the

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
is you're going to pop the

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:14.260 
is you're going to pop the
gram<00:01:08.100> module<00:01:08.820> out<00:01:09.350> one<00:01:10.350> at<00:01:10.440> a<00:01:10.530> time

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:20.420 

this<00:01:15.270> will<00:01:15.480> expose<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:18.140> little<00:01:19.140> tag<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.830> has

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
this will expose a little tag that has

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.540 
this will expose a little tag that has
serial<00:01:20.970> numbers<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.510> like<00:01:21.660> that<00:01:21.930> on<00:01:22.140> it

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:22.550 
serial numbers and like that on it

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.420 
serial numbers and like that on it
carefully<00:01:23.550> fill<00:01:24.060> up<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:25.290> one<00:01:25.560> side<00:01:25.980> of<00:01:26.280> the

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
carefully fill up the one side of the

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.310 
carefully fill up the one side of the
tag<00:01:26.670> you'll<00:01:27.120> feel<00:01:27.390> some<00:01:27.780> little<00:01:27.930> bumps

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
tag you'll feel some little bumps

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.500 
tag you'll feel some little bumps
underneath<00:01:29.420> the<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.450> tag<00:01:30.990> there<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:32.510> when

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:33.510 
underneath the the tag there and when

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:41.150 
underneath the the tag there and when
you<00:01:33.900> look<00:01:35.540> you're<00:01:36.540> going<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:36.990> see<00:01:39.350> some<00:01:40.350> too

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.160 
you look you're going to see some too

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.590 
you look you're going to see some too
little<00:01:41.430> jumper<00:01:42.270> points<00:01:43.130> right<00:01:44.130> here<00:01:44.600> and

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
little jumper points right here and

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.580 
little jumper points right here and
right<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:47.510> what<00:01:48.510> you<00:01:48.660> need<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.930> do<00:01:49.050> is<00:01:49.290> take<00:01:49.530> a

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
right and what you need to do is take a

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.460 
right and what you need to do is take a
small<00:01:49.860> screwdriver<00:01:50.480> paper<00:01:51.480> clip<00:01:51.900> board<00:01:52.260> over

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
small screwdriver paper clip board over

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.640 
small screwdriver paper clip board over
and<00:01:52.970> on<00:01:53.970> each<00:01:54.240> jumper<00:01:54.690> point<00:01:54.960> one<00:01:55.229> at<00:01:55.350> a<00:01:55.440> time

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
and on each jumper point one at a time

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.400 
and on each jumper point one at a time
for<00:01:56.250> 30<00:01:56.490> seconds<00:01:57.030> each<00:01:57.120> across<00:01:57.900> these<00:01:58.170> two

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:58.410 
for 30 seconds each across these two

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.850 
for 30 seconds each across these two
jumpers<00:01:58.800> and<00:01:59.220> then<00:02:00.210> cross<00:02:00.540> these<00:02:01.140> two<00:02:01.200> jumpers

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
jumpers and then cross these two jumpers

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.180 
jumpers and then cross these two jumpers
and<00:02:02.190> by<00:02:03.150> doing<00:02:03.420> that<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:04.229> that<00:02:04.650> will<00:02:04.830> clear

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
and by doing that and that will clear

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:11.630 
and by doing that and that will clear
the<00:02:06.120> CMOS<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:07.640> then<00:02:08.640> you<00:02:09.030> simply<00:02:09.710> put<00:02:10.710> the<00:02:10.950> tag

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
the CMOS and then you simply put the tag

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.979 
the CMOS and then you simply put the tag
back<00:02:11.910> down<00:02:12.180> again<00:02:12.600> and<00:02:13.430> reseat<00:02:14.510> your<00:02:15.510> memory

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
back down again and reseat your memory

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.010 
back down again and reseat your memory
modules<00:02:16.440> put<00:02:17.370> your<00:02:17.550> battery<00:02:17.940> back<00:02:18.150> in<00:02:18.450> and<00:02:18.900> all

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
modules put your battery back in and all

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.580 
modules put your battery back in and all
and<00:02:19.640> turn<00:02:20.640> it<00:02:20.790> back<00:02:20.820> on<00:02:20.970> your<00:02:21.570> CMOS<00:02:22.140> will<00:02:22.470> be

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
and turn it back on your CMOS will be

00:02:22.590 --> 00:03:38.990 
and turn it back on your CMOS will be
cleared<00:02:23.010> at<00:02:23.250> that<00:02:23.640> point

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000
