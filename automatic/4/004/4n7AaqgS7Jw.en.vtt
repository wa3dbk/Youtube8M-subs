00:00:08.859 --> 00:00:11.859

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:22.509
 since 18 3 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.150
 the writings left behind

 a nice example that is dramatic 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.370
 according to him 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.310
 the traffic on the viaduct had increased 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.520

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.670

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.080

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.400
 last round 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.190
 up to the brabanthallen 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.450
 before it is missing 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.450
 sports complex 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.580
 that means a person 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.580
 because to miss talking about it 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.050

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:59.560

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.469

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:12.469
 Dutch women 

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:16.899

00:02:36.169 --> 00:02:41.499

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:53.639
