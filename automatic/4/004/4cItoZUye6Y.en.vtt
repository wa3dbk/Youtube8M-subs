the rage increases their damage it's
wasted<00:01:07.110> damage<00:01:07.580> it<00:01:08.580> just<00:01:08.790> makes<00:01:08.939> really<00:01:09.360> the

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
reason we use them as to make it move

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.920

they<00:01:53.670> need<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.720> extra<00:01:54.990> damage<00:01:55.259> not<00:01:55.649> just<00:01:55.979> the

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
they need the extra damage not just the

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.149 
they need the extra damage not just the
extra<00:01:56.579> increased<00:01:57.270> attack<00:01:57.750> speed<00:01:58.009> so<00:01:59.009> you're

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
extra increased attack speed so you're

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.770 
extra increased attack speed so you're
going<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.369> see<00:01:59.610> that<00:01:59.640> at<00:02:00.119> ten<00:02:00.299> all<00:02:00.450> ten<00:02:00.479> you<00:02:00.750> can

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
going to see that at ten all ten you can

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.450 
going to see that at ten all ten you can
see<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.049> mix<00:02:01.290> of<00:02:01.409> these<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.799> think<00:02:02.280> you're<00:02:02.369> going

it some but go la lune with haste is
going<00:02:27.870> to<00:02:28.050> be<00:02:28.320> it's<00:02:28.980> going<00:02:29.010> to<00:02:29.220> be<00:02:29.280> something

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
going to be it's going to be something

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.570

it<00:02:30.390> is<00:02:30.540> a<00:02:30.570> smaller<00:02:31.170> diameter<00:02:31.470> spell<00:02:32.070> than<00:02:32.550> a

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
it is a smaller diameter spell than a

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.120 
it is a smaller diameter spell than a
rage<00:02:32.850> so<00:02:33.240> your<00:02:33.450> spell<00:02:33.810> placement<00:02:34.470> it's<00:02:34.980> going

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
rage so your spell placement it's going

rage so your spell placement it's going
to<00:02:35.190> have<00:02:35.280> to<00:02:35.310> be<00:02:35.400> a<00:02:35.430> little<00:02:35.580> bit<00:02:35.790> more<00:02:36.090> on<00:02:36.240> point

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
to have to be a little bit more on point

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.350 
to have to be a little bit more on point
but<00:02:37.380> for<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:37.920> most<00:02:38.100> part<00:02:38.250> it's<00:02:38.820> going<00:02:39.150> to<00:02:39.210> be

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
but for the most part it's going to be

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.420 
but for the most part it's going to be
just<00:02:39.660> you<00:02:39.870> know<00:02:39.990> get<00:02:40.560> those<00:02:40.710> balloons<00:02:41.040> moving

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
very quickly to their targets and then

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.410 
very quickly to their targets and then
they're<00:02:44.070> going<00:02:44.190> to<00:02:44.280> do<00:02:44.340> their<00:02:44.490> thing<00:02:44.760> a<00:02:45.000> lot<00:02:45.390> of

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
they're going to do their thing a lot of

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.170

the<00:02:45.540> golems<00:02:46.320> are<00:02:46.500> tanking<00:02:46.980> so<00:02:47.250> possibly<00:02:48.120> this

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
the golems are tanking so possibly this

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.810 
the golems are tanking so possibly this
is<00:02:48.360> a<00:02:48.390> good<00:02:48.570> way<00:02:48.690> to<00:02:48.720> combat<00:02:49.230> that<00:02:49.290> second<00:02:49.920> air

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
is a good way to combat that second air

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.070 
is a good way to combat that second air

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
I'm not going to comment on until

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.720 
I'm not going to comment on until
they're<00:03:13.290> confirmed<00:03:13.709> because<00:03:14.400> it<00:03:14.550> could<00:03:14.700> be

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
they're confirmed because it could be

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.100 
they're confirmed because it could be
way<00:03:14.970> off<00:03:15.000> it<00:03:15.330> could<00:03:15.450> be<00:03:15.540> something<00:03:15.690> that's<00:03:15.870> not

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
way off it could be something that's not

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.140 
way off it could be something that's not
you<00:03:16.770> know<00:03:16.920> it's<00:03:16.950> not<00:03:17.190> accurate<00:03:17.520> so<00:03:17.910> we'll<00:03:18.060> look

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
you know it's not accurate so we'll look

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.390 
you know it's not accurate so we'll look
at<00:03:18.270> that<00:03:18.330> when<00:03:18.570> it<00:03:18.690> comes<00:03:18.780> out<00:03:18.989> probably

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
at that when it comes out probably

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.010 
at that when it comes out probably
tomorrow<00:03:20.400> we'll<00:03:21.060> all<00:03:21.180> wake<00:03:21.300> up<00:03:21.360> to<00:03:21.630> the<00:03:21.720> update

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
tomorrow we'll all wake up to the update

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.620 
tomorrow we'll all wake up to the update
we'll<00:03:22.170> see<00:03:22.550> but<00:03:23.550> this<00:03:23.790> one<00:03:24.000> is<00:03:24.150> definitely

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
we'll see but this one is definitely

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.180 
we'll see but this one is definitely
better<00:03:24.930> than<00:03:25.050> the<00:03:25.230> earthquake<00:03:25.620> I<00:03:25.800> think<00:03:26.070> it

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
better than the earthquake I think it

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:28.460 
better than the earthquake I think it
