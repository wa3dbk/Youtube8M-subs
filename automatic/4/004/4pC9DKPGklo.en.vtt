problem<00:00:49.110> solve<00:00:49.379> with<00:00:49.590> this<00:00:49.739> we<00:00:50.129> come<00:00:50.370> down<00:00:50.579> and

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
problem solve with this we come down and

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.040 
problem solve with this we come down and
then<00:00:51.690> from<00:00:52.140> here<00:00:52.559> guys<00:00:53.070> we<00:00:53.760> come<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.360> push<00:00:54.780> up

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
then from here guys we come and push up

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.200 
then from here guys we come and push up
we're<00:00:55.440> almost<00:00:55.620> in<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.070> bridge<00:00:56.309> position<00:00:56.550> as<00:00:57.030> it

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
we're almost in a bridge position as it

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.750 
we're almost in a bridge position as it
is<00:00:57.360> so<00:00:57.510> we<00:00:57.539> can<00:00:57.690> get<00:00:57.870> great<00:00:58.140> glute<00:00:58.440> activation

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
is so we can get great glute activation

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.490 
is so we can get great glute activation
so<00:00:59.760> we're<00:00:59.879> down<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.300> the<00:01:00.359> bottom<00:01:00.809> right<00:01:01.199> here

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
so we're down to the bottom right here

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.579 
so we're down to the bottom right here
right<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.190> can<00:01:02.340> see<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:03.239> leg<00:01:03.589> everything
