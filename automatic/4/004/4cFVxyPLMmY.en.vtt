arm up perfectly however if the person

arm up perfectly however if the person
the<00:01:04.470> theory<00:01:05.040> is<00:01:05.159> if<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.610> person<00:01:05.760> sitting<00:01:06.210> next

the theory is if the person sitting next
to<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:06.810> or<00:01:06.920> further<00:01:07.920> away<00:01:08.159> from<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.490> computer

they can't they can't see what is on the

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.440 
they can't they can't see what is on the
screen<00:01:13.500> that<00:01:13.710> is<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:13.950> underlying<00:01:14.790> principle

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
screen that is the underlying principle

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.770 
screen that is the underlying principle
of<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.750> privacy<00:01:16.380> screen<00:01:16.979> protector<00:01:17.580> so<00:01:17.760> if<00:01:18.570> I

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
of a privacy screen protector so if I

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.290 
of a privacy screen protector so if I
was<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:19.020> move<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.350> camera<00:01:19.800> off<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:21.090> left

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.300 
was to move the camera off to the left

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.720 
was to move the camera off to the left
slightly<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:22.470> will<00:01:22.620> see<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:23.340> the

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:23.730 
slightly you will see that the

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.900 
slightly you will see that the
brightness<00:01:24.260> diminishes<00:01:25.260> and<00:01:25.490> you<00:01:26.490> will<00:01:26.670> see

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:26.910 
brightness diminishes and you will see

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.470 
brightness diminishes and you will see
that<00:01:27.150> if<00:01:27.330> I<00:01:27.540> move<00:01:27.780> further<00:01:28.410> away<00:01:28.920> you<00:01:29.480> can

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:30.480 
that if I move further away you can

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.740 
that if I move further away you can
hardly<00:01:30.780> see<00:01:31.080> what<00:01:31.320> is<00:01:31.740> on<00:01:31.980> the<00:01:32.310> screen<00:01:32.750> it's

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
hardly see what is on the screen it's

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.480 
hardly see what is on the screen it's
hard<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.050> see<00:01:34.200> through<00:01:34.440> the<00:01:34.560> camera<00:01:34.980> because

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
hard to see through the camera because

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.870 
hard to see through the camera because
arm<00:01:35.910> from<00:01:36.630> my<00:01:36.810> perspective<00:01:37.080> it<00:01:38.070> really<00:01:38.700> does

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
arm from my perspective it really does

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.320 
arm from my perspective it really does
darken<00:01:39.480> the<00:01:39.870> the<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:42.270> laptop<00:01:42.690> screen<00:01:42.870> out

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
darken the the the the laptop screen out

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.540 
darken the the the the laptop screen out
by<00:01:45.330> such<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.750> great<00:01:46.050> factor<00:01:46.650> but<00:01:47.220> it's<00:01:47.370> not

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:47.550 
by such a great factor but it's not

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.670 
by such a great factor but it's not
represented<00:01:48.180> that<00:01:48.390> much<00:01:48.630> on<00:01:48.870> the<00:01:49.080> camera

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
represented that much on the camera

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.810 
represented that much on the camera
itself<00:01:50.070> so<00:01:50.760> this<00:01:50.940> is<00:01:51.090> moving<00:01:51.480> to<00:01:51.900> the<00:01:52.080> left<00:01:52.440> and

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
itself so this is moving to the left and

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.350 
itself so this is moving to the left and
if<00:01:53.820> we<00:01:53.880> was<00:01:54.300> to<00:01:54.330> move<00:01:54.780> at<00:01:55.140> an<00:01:55.350> altar<00:01:55.650> say

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
if we was to move at an altar say

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.120 
if we was to move at an altar say
standing<00:01:57.360> up<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:58.530> can<00:01:58.680> see<00:01:58.830> that<00:01:58.860> you<00:01:59.010> can

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
standing up you can see that you can

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.969 
standing up you can see that you can
still<00:01:59.250> see<00:01:59.760> what<00:02:00.150> is<00:02:00.390> on<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:01.229> the<00:02:01.620> screen

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
still see what is on the the screen

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.820 
still see what is on the the screen
itself<00:02:02.340> so<00:02:02.550> if<00:02:02.640> somebody<00:02:03.000> will<00:02:03.150> sustained

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
itself so if somebody will sustained

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.500 
itself so if somebody will sustained
directly<00:02:04.830> over<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.400> they<00:02:05.580> could<00:02:05.790> see<00:02:06.060> what<00:02:06.330> is

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
directly over you they could see what is

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.889 
directly over you they could see what is
on<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.810> screen<00:02:07.440> sitting<00:02:08.369> back<00:02:08.550> down<00:02:08.819> you<00:02:09.720> can

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
on the screen sitting back down you can

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.559 
on the screen sitting back down you can
say<00:02:10.110> you<00:02:10.619> can<00:02:10.679> see<00:02:11.039> that<00:02:11.310> you<00:02:11.519> can<00:02:11.730> see<00:02:12.000> what<00:02:12.420> is

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
say you can see that you can see what is

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.030 
say you can see that you can see what is
on<00:02:12.840> the<00:02:12.890> screen<00:02:13.890> quite<00:02:14.819> perfectly<00:02:15.379> so<00:02:16.379> let's

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
on the screen quite perfectly so let's

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.509 
on the screen quite perfectly so let's
move<00:02:17.280> over<00:02:17.640> to<00:02:18.650> the<00:02:19.650> right<00:02:19.830> hand<00:02:19.980> side<00:02:20.250> and<00:02:20.430> you

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
move over to the right hand side and you

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:22.369 
move over to the right hand side and you
can<00:02:20.670> see<00:02:20.700> what<00:02:21.120> there<00:02:21.299> is<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.900> screen<00:02:22.230> is

can see what there is the screen is
completely<00:02:22.850> blacked<00:02:23.850> out<00:02:24.120> now<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.140> screen<00:02:25.560> is

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
it is reversible in a sense that you

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.050 
it is reversible in a sense that you
have<00:03:37.530> this<00:03:37.680> matte<00:03:37.920> finish<00:03:38.280> so<00:03:38.490> if<00:03:38.610> I<00:03:38.760> was<00:03:38.880> to

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
have this matte finish so if I was to

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.750 
have this matte finish so if I was to
turn<00:03:39.900> this<00:03:40.080> right<00:03:40.470> down<00:03:40.770> you've<00:03:41.340> got<00:03:41.520> a<00:03:41.550> nice

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760

turn this right down you've got a nice
matte<00:03:42.210> finish<00:03:42.240> and<00:03:42.660> a<00:03:42.900> good<00:03:43.080> thing<00:03:43.230> about<00:03:43.290> this

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
matte finish and a good thing about this

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.370 
matte finish and a good thing about this
is<00:03:44.100> that<00:03:45.060> it<00:03:45.210> doesn't<00:03:45.390> reflect<00:03:45.750> light<00:03:46.110> so<00:03:46.140> you

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
is that it doesn't reflect light so you

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:47.600 
is that it doesn't reflect light so you
can<00:03:46.440> take<00:03:46.710> this<00:03:46.830> out<00:03:47.010> into<00:03:47.250> the<00:03:47.340> sunlight

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
considerations for the camera hole so

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.630 
considerations for the camera hole so
you've<00:04:30.120> got<00:04:30.300> a<00:04:30.330> cutout<00:04:30.600> um<00:04:31.260> the<00:04:32.070> problem<00:04:32.280> is

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
you've got a cutout um the problem is

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.980 
you've got a cutout um the problem is
was<00:04:33.150> the<00:04:33.300> installation<00:04:33.690> arm<00:04:34.440> I<00:04:34.890> would<00:04:35.130> say

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
was the installation arm I would say

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.320 
was the installation arm I would say
that<00:04:36.990> basically<00:04:37.200> the<00:04:37.590> installation<00:04:38.330> wasn't

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
that basically the installation wasn't

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.090 
that basically the installation wasn't
that<00:04:39.450> clear<00:04:39.870> cut<00:04:40.169> I<00:04:40.320> think<00:04:40.560> it's<00:04:40.710> due<00:04:40.860> to<00:04:41.010> the

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
that clear cut I think it's due to the

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:42.549 
that clear cut I think it's due to the
instructions

00:04:42.549 --> 00:04:42.559 
instructions

00:04:42.559 --> 00:04:45.039 
instructions
because<00:04:43.309> this<00:04:43.549> is<00:04:43.849> not<00:04:44.089> a<00:04:44.149> scream<00:04:44.509> total<00:04:44.929> like

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:45.049 
because this is not a scream total like

00:04:45.049 --> 00:04:48.219 
because this is not a scream total like
an<00:04:45.199> iPad<00:04:45.529> or<00:04:45.559> an<00:04:45.739> iPhone<00:04:45.859> iPhone<00:04:47.229> screen

onto the screen this doesn't stick on to
the<00:04:52.339> screen<00:04:52.639> um<00:04:52.909> if<00:04:53.809> I'm<00:04:54.049> correct<00:04:54.289> what<00:04:54.889> the

00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:55.009 
the screen um if I'm correct what the

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:57.699 
the screen um if I'm correct what the
instruction<00:04:55.609> was<00:04:55.969> trying<00:04:56.419> to<00:04:56.479> tell<00:04:56.719> me<00:04:56.929> and<00:04:57.139> I

00:04:57.699 --> 00:04:57.709 
instruction was trying to tell me and I

00:04:57.709 --> 00:04:59.649 
instruction was trying to tell me and I
noticed<00:04:58.189> it<00:04:58.369> was<00:04:58.549> in<00:04:58.729> a<00:04:58.939> different<00:04:59.359> language

00:04:59.649 --> 00:04:59.659 
noticed it was in a different language

00:04:59.659 --> 00:05:03.249 
noticed it was in a different language
as<00:05:00.019> well<00:05:00.229> is<00:05:00.619> that<00:05:00.889> you<00:05:01.819> they<00:05:02.509> provide<00:05:02.929> some

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:03.259 
as well is that you they provide some

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:07.529 
as well is that you they provide some
tapes<00:05:03.589> in<00:05:03.979> 3m<00:05:04.489> tape<00:05:04.849> and<00:05:05.359> basically<00:05:05.989> I<00:05:06.799> think

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:07.539 
tapes in 3m tape and basically I think

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:10.809 
tapes in 3m tape and basically I think
he<00:05:08.539> was<00:05:08.659> supposed<00:05:08.869> to<00:05:08.989> tape<00:05:09.379> the<00:05:10.039> screen<00:05:10.519> text

00:05:10.809 --> 00:05:10.819 
he was supposed to tape the screen text

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:12.729 
he was supposed to tape the screen text
damage<00:05:11.239> it<00:05:11.419> didn't<00:05:11.689> make<00:05:11.809> no<00:05:11.839> sense<00:05:12.379> to<00:05:12.709> me

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:12.739 
damage it didn't make no sense to me

00:05:12.739 --> 00:05:15.399 
damage it didn't make no sense to me
hence<00:05:13.579> I<00:05:13.819> had<00:05:14.059> to<00:05:14.209> go<00:05:14.359> out<00:05:14.539> and<00:05:14.809> I<00:05:14.869> had<00:05:15.049> to<00:05:15.199> buy

00:05:15.399 --> 00:05:15.409 
hence I had to go out and I had to buy

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:18.549 
hence I had to go out and I had to buy
some<00:05:15.829> double-sided<00:05:16.549> tape<00:05:16.899> which<00:05:17.899> cost<00:05:18.289> me

00:05:18.549 --> 00:05:18.559 
some double-sided tape which cost me

00:05:18.559 --> 00:05:21.939 
some double-sided tape which cost me
about<00:05:18.859> $4.99<00:05:19.759> from<00:05:20.239> WH<00:05:20.689> Smith<00:05:21.109> solar<00:05:21.619> that

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:21.949 
about $4.99 from WH Smith solar that

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:23.879 
about $4.99 from WH Smith solar that
costs<00:05:22.309> me<00:05:22.429> money<00:05:22.609> up<00:05:22.849> my<00:05:22.999> own<00:05:23.149> pocket<00:05:23.389> and

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:23.889 
costs me money up my own pocket and

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:26.409 
costs me money up my own pocket and
basically<00:05:24.889> what<00:05:25.069> I've<00:05:25.159> done<00:05:25.339> is<00:05:25.579> I<00:05:25.789> just<00:05:25.849> put<00:05:26.389> a

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:26.419 
basically what I've done is I just put a

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:30.059 
basically what I've done is I just put a
little<00:05:26.719> bit<00:05:27.369> behind<00:05:28.369> four<00:05:28.729> corners<00:05:29.269> and

00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:30.069 
little bit behind four corners and

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:32.559 
little bit behind four corners and
that's<00:05:31.069> what's<00:05:31.699> holding<00:05:31.969> the<00:05:32.299> screen

00:05:32.559 --> 00:05:32.569 
that's what's holding the screen

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:34.959 
that's what's holding the screen
together<00:05:32.989> so<00:05:33.709> basically<00:05:34.069> you<00:05:34.309> can<00:05:34.489> take<00:05:34.789> it

00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:34.969 
together so basically you can take it

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:37.449 
together so basically you can take it
off<00:05:35.089> wash<00:05:35.569> it<00:05:35.839> and<00:05:35.989> reuse<00:05:36.049> it<00:05:36.469> it's<00:05:36.769> reusable

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:37.459 
off wash it and reuse it it's reusable

00:05:37.459 --> 00:05:40.359 
off wash it and reuse it it's reusable
