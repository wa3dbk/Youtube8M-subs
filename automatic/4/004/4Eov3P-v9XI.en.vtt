00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
my conspiracy theory is basically this

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.710

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
eventually at some point there is going

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:29.730 
eventually at some point there is going
to<00:03:25.390> be<00:03:25.450> a<00:03:25.570> push<00:03:25.870> back<00:03:26.700> by<00:03:27.700> men<00:03:28.500> about<00:03:29.500> these
