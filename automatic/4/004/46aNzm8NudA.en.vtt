00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
hello my name is Curtis Wilkerson and I

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.549 
hello my name is Curtis Wilkerson and I
am<00:00:12.000> a<00:00:12.059> quality<00:00:12.450> assurance<00:00:12.540> engineer<00:00:12.990> for<00:00:13.469> the

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
am a quality assurance engineer for the

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.010 
am a quality assurance engineer for the
Mars<00:00:13.799> Science<00:00:14.099> Laboratory<00:00:14.490> Rover<00:00:14.880> and<00:00:15.360> this

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
Mars Science Laboratory Rover and this

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.170 
Mars Science Laboratory Rover and this
is<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:16.980> Jet<00:00:17.160> Propulsion<00:00:17.190> Laboratory

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
is the Jet Propulsion Laboratory

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.570 
is the Jet Propulsion Laboratory
spacecraft<00:00:18.900> assembly<00:00:19.380> facility<00:00:19.830> this<00:00:20.520> is

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
spacecraft assembly facility this is

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.689 
spacecraft assembly facility this is
literally<00:00:21.090> where<00:00:21.900> it<00:00:22.050> all<00:00:22.199> comes<00:00:22.470> together

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:22.699 
literally where it all comes together

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:25.759 
literally where it all comes together
come<00:00:23.699> on<00:00:23.820> let's<00:00:24.060> go<00:00:24.150> inside<00:00:24.619> when<00:00:25.619> we're

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
come on let's go inside when we're

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.620 
come on let's go inside when we're
building<00:00:25.890> a<00:00:26.130> spacecraft<00:00:26.640> all<00:00:27.090> of<00:00:27.269> its<00:00:27.390> parts

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
building a spacecraft all of its parts

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.089 
building a spacecraft all of its parts
are<00:00:27.720> brought<00:00:27.840> here<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.439> cleanroom<00:00:28.680> the

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
are brought here to the cleanroom the

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.669 
are brought here to the cleanroom the
final<00:00:29.429> assembly<00:00:29.900> so<00:00:30.900> why<00:00:31.019> do<00:00:31.080> we<00:00:31.199> use<00:00:31.230> a<00:00:31.410> clean

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
final assembly so why do we use a clean

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.950 
final assembly so why do we use a clean
room<00:00:31.830> because<00:00:32.790> dust<00:00:33.059> particles<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:33.809> other

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
room because dust particles and other

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.350 
room because dust particles and other
microscopic<00:00:34.380> contaminants<00:00:35.280> can<00:00:35.489> harm<00:00:36.239> our

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
microscopic contaminants can harm our

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.209 
microscopic contaminants can harm our
sensitive<00:00:36.750> equipment<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.320> optics<00:00:37.710> so<00:00:38.129> we

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
sensitive equipment and optics so we

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.350 
sensitive equipment and optics so we
have<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.399> remove<00:00:38.579> those<00:00:38.760> particles<00:00:39.030> from<00:00:39.270> the

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
have to remove those particles from the

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.410 
have to remove those particles from the
air<00:00:39.570> also<00:00:40.230> tiny<00:00:40.980> airborne<00:00:41.219> life<00:00:41.640> forms<00:00:42.059> called

microbes coexist with us we have to

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.979 
microbes coexist with us we have to
remove<00:00:44.640> those<00:00:44.850> as<00:00:45.090> well<00:00:45.270> because<00:00:45.750> we<00:00:45.870> don't

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
remove those as well because we don't

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.450 
remove those as well because we don't
want<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.170> visit<00:00:46.289> another<00:00:46.559> planet<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.100> think

want to visit another planet and think
we've<00:00:47.610> discovered<00:00:48.000> life<00:00:48.300> just<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.899> find<00:00:49.079> out

the largest Rover this planet has ever
sent<00:03:54.700> to<00:03:54.790> Mars<00:03:55.060> it's<00:03:56.049> mid-october<00:03:56.319> and<00:03:56.920> right

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
sent to Mars it's mid-october and right

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:58.559 
sent to Mars it's mid-october and right
now<00:03:57.670> we're<00:03:57.819> doing<00:03:57.970> a<00:03:58.030> lot<00:03:58.120> of<00:03:58.180> electrical

00:03:58.559 --> 00:03:58.569 
now we're doing a lot of electrical

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:00.360 
now we're doing a lot of electrical
testing<00:03:59.080> but<00:03:59.620> the<00:03:59.739> closer<00:03:59.920> we<00:04:00.129> get<00:04:00.220> to<00:04:00.280> our

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
testing but the closer we get to our

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:01.949 
testing but the closer we get to our
launch<00:04:00.640> date<00:04:00.909> we'll<00:04:01.420> start<00:04:01.599> adding<00:04:01.780> our

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:04.299 
wheels and I mess with the cameras and

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:06.000 
wheels and I mess with the cameras and
then<00:04:04.480> the<00:04:04.569> robotic<00:04:04.989> arm<00:04:05.140> they'll<00:04:05.830> really

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
then the robotic arm they'll really

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.650 
then the robotic arm they'll really
start<00:04:06.250> to<00:04:06.310> take<00:04:06.459> form<00:04:06.700> once<00:04:07.330> we're<00:04:07.510> finished
