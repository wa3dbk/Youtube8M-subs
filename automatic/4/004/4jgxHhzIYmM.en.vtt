and<00:02:13.790> this<00:02:14.510> curb<00:02:14.750> reminds<00:02:15.140> me<00:02:15.350> of<00:02:15.500> like<00:02:15.530> little

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
and this curb reminds me of like little

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.610 
and this curb reminds me of like little
ringlets<00:02:16.190> and<00:02:16.760> I<00:02:17.510> really<00:02:17.810> try<00:02:18.020> not<00:02:18.170> to<00:02:18.260> do<00:02:18.380> much

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
ringlets and I really try not to do much

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.130 
ringlets and I really try not to do much
of<00:02:18.650> touching<00:02:19.340> with<00:02:19.520> the<00:02:19.550> hair<00:02:19.990> because<00:02:20.990> I

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
of touching with the hair because I

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.510 
of touching with the hair because I
would<00:02:21.320> make<00:02:21.440> the<00:02:21.560> hair<00:02:21.710> bigger<00:02:22.010> and<00:02:22.250> kind<00:02:22.430> of

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
would make the hair bigger and kind of

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.230 
would make the hair bigger and kind of
frame<00:02:22.820> so<00:02:24.040> now<00:02:25.040> this<00:02:25.220> is<00:02:25.280> they<00:02:25.490> are<00:02:25.520> straight
