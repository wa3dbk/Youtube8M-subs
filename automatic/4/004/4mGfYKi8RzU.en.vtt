what I wanted to explain is what is the

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.479 
what I wanted to explain is what is the
difference<00:00:34.170> between<00:00:34.230> this<00:00:34.710> particular<00:00:35.040> model

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489

difference between this particular model
of<00:00:35.550> what<00:00:35.700> we<00:00:35.850> have<00:00:36.000> here<00:00:36.180> in<00:00:36.270> Australia<00:00:36.390> now<00:00:37.020> so

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
of what we have here in Australia now so

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.270 
of what we have here in Australia now so
the<00:00:38.250> Liberty<00:00:38.910> was<00:00:39.420> sold<00:00:39.690> in<00:00:39.809> Australia<00:00:40.379> as<00:00:40.530> a<00:00:40.980> 2

the Liberty was sold in Australia as a 2

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.940 
the Liberty was sold in Australia as a 2
litre<00:00:41.640> model<00:00:42.059> soon<00:00:42.629> after<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.110> twin<00:00:43.379> turbo

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950

Subaru Libby ended its life around a 102

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.240 
Subaru Libby ended its life around a 102
so<00:00:48.329> in<00:00:48.690> that<00:00:49.020> year<00:00:49.260> they<00:00:49.440> then<00:00:49.620> went<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:49.950> 2

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
so in that year they then went to the 2

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.939 
so in that year they then went to the 2
litre<00:00:50.489> twin<00:00:50.969> scroll<00:00:51.270> turbo<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:52.020> then<00:00:52.559> for<00:00:52.770> two

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
litre twin scroll turbo and then for two

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.700 
litre twin scroll turbo and then for two
or<00:00:53.039> three<00:00:53.250> years<00:00:53.280> up<00:00:53.699> until<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:54.149> five<00:00:54.629> this<00:00:55.379> car

or three years up until a five this car

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.279 
or three years up until a five this car
was<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.129> very<00:00:56.489> popular<00:00:56.969> car<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.719> was<00:00:57.840> only<00:00:58.020> two

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
was a very popular car it was only two

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.490 
was a very popular car it was only two
later<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:59.280> twin<00:00:59.579> scroll<00:00:59.910> entry<00:01:00.510> turbo<00:01:00.960> for

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
later and a twin scroll entry turbo for

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.860 
later and a twin scroll entry turbo for
really<00:01:01.770> good<00:01:01.890> bottom<00:01:02.219> entry<00:01:02.520> performance<00:01:03.390> but

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
really good bottom entry performance but

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.270 
really good bottom entry performance but
it's<00:01:04.019> not<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.290> type<00:01:04.500> of<00:01:04.530> engine<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.100> can

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
it's not the type of engine you can

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.179 
it's not the type of engine you can
expect<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.790> get<00:01:05.909> really<00:01:06.299> good<00:01:06.479> middle

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:07.189 
expect to get really good middle

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:09.620 
expect to get really good middle
mid-range<00:01:08.189> or<00:01:08.520> top<00:01:08.760> end<00:01:08.970> power<00:01:09.030> out<00:01:09.420> of<00:01:09.450> it

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
mid-range or top end power out of it

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.450 
mid-range or top end power out of it
because<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.320> design<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.920> turbo<00:01:11.280> is

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
because of the design of the turbo is

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.950 
because of the design of the turbo is
for<00:01:11.640> bottom<00:01:11.939> end<00:01:12.090> performance<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.750> it's<00:01:12.869> a

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
for bottom end performance and it's a

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.800 
for bottom end performance and it's a
real<00:01:13.170> cruzi<00:01:13.979> freeway<00:01:14.490> type<00:01:14.760> car<00:01:15.030> so<00:01:15.630> if<00:01:15.689> you

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
real cruzi freeway type car so if you

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.260 
real cruzi freeway type car so if you
want<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.020> get<00:01:16.140> more<00:01:16.380> power<00:01:16.950> if<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:18.000> put<00:01:18.180> an

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
want to get more power if you put an

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.030 
want to get more power if you put an
exhaust<00:01:18.570> system<00:01:18.659> on<00:01:18.990> this<00:01:19.170> car<00:01:19.439> you<00:01:19.890> got<00:01:20.009> a

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
exhaust system on this car you got a

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.160 
exhaust system on this car you got a
dramatic<00:01:20.549> risk<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:21.090> failing<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.600> turbo<00:01:21.990> by

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
dramatic risk of failing the turbo by

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.649 
dramatic risk of failing the turbo by
over<00:01:22.530> speeding<00:01:22.830> speeding<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.820> exhaust<00:01:24.390> wheel

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
over speeding speeding the exhaust wheel

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.840 
over speeding speeding the exhaust wheel
which<00:01:25.140> ultimately<00:01:25.619> fails<00:01:25.979> on<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.340> shaft<00:01:26.610> and

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
which ultimately fails on the shaft and

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.120 
which ultimately fails on the shaft and
I've<00:01:27.000> seen<00:01:27.210> situations<00:01:27.479> where<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.590> where<00:01:29.100> the

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
I've seen situations where the where the

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.560 
I've seen situations where the where the
exhaust<00:01:29.520> wheel<00:01:29.729> has<00:01:29.880> gone<00:01:30.030> down<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.450> the

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
very expensive turbo to replace so after

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.429 
very expensive turbo to replace so after
this<00:01:35.880> particular<00:01:36.299> model<00:01:36.659> they<00:01:36.869> went<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.290> the

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
this particular model they went to the

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.060 
this particular model they went to the

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.280 
my feet I've tried to gather the parts
together<00:01:48.149> there's<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.930> different

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
together there's the different

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.510 
together there's the different
components<00:01:49.770> that<00:01:49.799> are<00:01:49.950> going<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.189> go<00:01:50.310> under

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
components that are going to go under

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.520 
components that are going to go under
this<00:01:50.640> car<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.570> what<00:01:51.720> we'll<00:01:51.869> do<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.049> I'll<00:01:52.229> show

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
this car and what we'll do is I'll show

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.899 
this car and what we'll do is I'll show
you<00:01:52.590> up<00:01:52.860> underneath<00:01:53.159> here<00:01:53.490> where<00:01:53.790> the

you up underneath here where the

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:54.859 
you up underneath here where the
components<00:01:54.479> go

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
components go

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.600 
components go
and<00:01:54.960> then<00:01:55.380> we'll<00:01:55.530> focus<00:01:55.680> on<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.130> individual

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
and then we'll focus on the individual

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.100 
and then we'll focus on the individual
parts<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:57.000> what<00:01:57.119> you<00:01:57.240> can<00:01:57.420> expect<00:01:57.780> if<00:01:58.020> you're

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
parts of what you can expect if you're

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.840 
parts of what you can expect if you're
going<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.320> do<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.469> similar<00:01:58.740> upgrade<00:01:59.250> so<00:01:59.640> I<00:01:59.670> get

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
going to do a similar upgrade so I get

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:00.890 
going to do a similar upgrade so I get
my<00:01:59.969> cameraman<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.600> here

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
my cameraman to here

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.010

your oil filter the exhaust manifold

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.140 
your oil filter the exhaust manifold
collects<00:02:12.990> it<00:02:13.140> into<00:02:13.410> two<00:02:13.620> pipes<00:02:13.920> and<00:02:14.280> goes<00:02:14.850> up

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
collects it into two pipes and goes up

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.060 
collects it into two pipes and goes up
into<00:02:15.270> the<00:02:15.480> underside<00:02:15.600> of<00:02:15.960> the<00:02:16.140> turbo<00:02:16.530> up

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
into the underside of the turbo up

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.460 
into the underside of the turbo up
inside<00:02:17.490> there<00:02:17.790> and<00:02:18.060> then<00:02:18.690> on<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:19.200> backside

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
inside there and then on the backside

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.370 
inside there and then on the backside
here<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.580> exhaust<00:02:20.940> outlet<00:02:21.720> comes<00:02:22.170> out

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
here the exhaust outlet comes out

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.470 
here the exhaust outlet comes out
through<00:02:22.560> a<00:02:22.590> catalytic<00:02:23.010> converter<00:02:23.300> around<00:02:24.300> the

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
through a catalytic converter around the

through a catalytic converter around the
side<00:02:24.720> of<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:24.930> gearbox<00:02:25.170> and<00:02:25.620> then<00:02:26.010> it<00:02:26.130> goes<00:02:26.280> out

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
side of the gearbox and then it goes out

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.360 
side of the gearbox and then it goes out
through<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:27.360> back<00:02:27.540> of<00:02:27.570> the<00:02:27.810> car<00:02:28.020> so<00:02:28.620> hold<00:02:29.190> that

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
through the back of the car so hold that

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:30.800 
through the back of the car so hold that
thought<00:02:29.670> on<00:02:29.850> what<00:02:29.940> we're<00:02:30.120> talking<00:02:30.450> about<00:02:30.660> as

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
thought on what we're talking about as

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.740 
thought on what we're talking about as
far<00:02:31.020> as<00:02:31.140> parts<00:02:31.620> and<00:02:31.950> you<00:02:32.280> can<00:02:32.460> see<00:02:32.670> here<00:02:33.060> this

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
far as parts and you can see here this

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.020 
far as parts and you can see here this
is<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:33.990> exhaust<00:02:34.500> manifold<00:02:35.070> with<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:35.850> two

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
is the exhaust manifold with the two

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.820 
is the exhaust manifold with the two
outlets<00:02:36.390> but<00:02:36.900> you'll<00:02:37.020> notice<00:02:37.200> how<00:02:37.440> it's<00:02:37.620> got

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
outlets but you'll notice how it's got

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.080 
outlets but you'll notice how it's got
two<00:02:38.370> pipes<00:02:38.670> here<00:02:39.000> because<00:02:39.840> those<00:02:40.080> pipes<00:02:40.470> there

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
two pipes here because those pipes there

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.240 
two pipes here because those pipes there
connect<00:02:42.090> to<00:02:42.240> the<00:02:42.360> up<00:02:42.510> pipe<00:02:42.780> which<00:02:43.740> is<00:02:44.010> then

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
connect to the up pipe which is then

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.730 
connect to the up pipe which is then
maintaining<00:02:45.000> two<00:02:45.209> pipes<00:02:45.510> here<00:02:45.840> which<00:02:46.440> lead

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
maintaining two pipes here which lead

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.540 
maintaining two pipes here which lead
into<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.310> underside<00:02:47.970> of<00:02:48.209> the<00:02:48.300> turbo<00:02:49.280> of<00:02:50.280> the

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
into the underside of the turbo of the

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.460 
into the underside of the turbo of the
original<00:02:50.910> factory<00:02:51.090> design<00:02:51.390> and<00:02:51.959> that's<00:02:52.290> why

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
original factory design and that's why

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.990 
original factory design and that's why
it's<00:02:52.650> a<00:02:52.709> twin-scroll<00:02:53.250> turbo<00:02:53.670> because<00:02:53.790> it's

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
it's a twin-scroll turbo because it's

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.720 
it's a twin-scroll turbo because it's
got<00:02:54.120> twin<00:02:54.420> entry<00:02:54.840> into<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:55.800> exhaust<00:02:56.190> side<00:02:56.430> of

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
got twin entry into the exhaust side of

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.390 
got twin entry into the exhaust side of
the<00:02:57.120> turbo<00:02:57.480> and<00:02:57.720> then<00:02:58.230> it's<00:02:58.380> got<00:02:58.530> a<00:02:58.770> normal

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
the turbo and then it's got a normal

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.000 
the turbo and then it's got a normal
common<00:03:00.209> outlet<00:03:00.660> very<00:03:01.140> very<00:03:01.350> similar<00:03:01.680> to<00:03:01.800> a<00:03:01.830> lot

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
common outlet very very similar to a lot

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.220 
common outlet very very similar to a lot
of<00:03:02.040> other<00:03:02.250> Subaru<00:03:02.670> design<00:03:03.030> turbos<00:03:03.510> but<00:03:04.080> this

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
of other Subaru design turbos but this

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.259 
of other Subaru design turbos but this
particular<00:03:04.590> turbo<00:03:05.160> is<00:03:05.310> the<00:03:05.430> one<00:03:05.610> that<00:03:05.760> you<00:03:06.120> can

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
particular turbo is the one that you can

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.180 
particular turbo is the one that you can
see<00:03:06.450> how<00:03:06.600> small<00:03:06.930> it<00:03:06.989> is<00:03:07.200> it's<00:03:07.470> very<00:03:07.530> small<00:03:07.890> in

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
see how small it is it's very small in

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.460 
see how small it is it's very small in
the<00:03:08.280> compressor<00:03:08.760> housing<00:03:08.910> it's<00:03:09.780> not<00:03:10.080> designed

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
the compressor housing it's not designed

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.770 
the compressor housing it's not designed
for<00:03:10.590> big<00:03:10.860> boost<00:03:11.130> if<00:03:11.670> you<00:03:11.850> try<00:03:12.060> to<00:03:12.120> promote<00:03:12.390> and

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
for big boost if you try to promote and

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.830 
for big boost if you try to promote and
push<00:03:13.380> these<00:03:13.590> turbos<00:03:14.100> too<00:03:14.310> hard<00:03:14.580> they<00:03:15.090> fail<00:03:15.510> and

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
push these turbos too hard they fail and

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.300 
push these turbos too hard they fail and
you're<00:03:16.350> talking<00:03:16.500> about<00:03:16.739> three<00:03:17.010> or<00:03:17.160> four

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
you're talking about three or four

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.400 
you're talking about three or four
thousand<00:03:17.760> dollar<00:03:17.910> turbo<00:03:18.360> repair<00:03:18.750> so<00:03:19.200> from

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
thousand dollar turbo repair so from

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.350 
thousand dollar turbo repair so from
their<00:03:19.650> back<00:03:19.920> it's<00:03:20.370> a<00:03:20.489> pretty<00:03:20.700> common<00:03:20.970> design

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
their back it's a pretty common design

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.420 
their back it's a pretty common design
exhaust<00:03:21.750> system<00:03:22.140> so<00:03:22.709> what<00:03:22.860> do<00:03:22.950> we<00:03:23.010> do<00:03:23.250> that's

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
exhaust system so what do we do that's

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.900 
exhaust system so what do we do that's
different

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
different

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.840 
different
well<00:03:24.420> we<00:03:24.720> replace<00:03:25.110> this<00:03:25.350> part<00:03:25.620> here<00:03:25.980> with<00:03:26.820> a

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
well we replace this part here with a

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.850 
well we replace this part here with a
converter<00:03:27.360> pipe<00:03:27.690> and<00:03:28.380> it<00:03:28.470> goes<00:03:28.620> from

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
converter pipe and it goes from

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.699 
converter pipe and it goes from
twin-scroll<00:03:29.550> up<00:03:30.360> into<00:03:30.600> a<00:03:30.660> single<00:03:30.930> entry<00:03:31.410> and

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709
