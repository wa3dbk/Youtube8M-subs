00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.759 
excited it looks pretty damn good and we
like<00:00:26.910> space<00:00:27.480> engineers<00:00:27.930> so<00:00:28.140> yeah<00:00:28.410> you'll<00:00:28.619> see

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
like space engineers so yeah you'll see

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.140 
like space engineers so yeah you'll see
the<00:00:28.859> footage<00:00:29.039> in<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.250> background<00:00:29.310> watching

right at least min to another point
actually<00:00:52.110> um<00:00:52.610> they<00:00:53.610> are<00:00:53.789> doing<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.300> lot<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.449> mod

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
actually um they are doing a lot of mod

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:55.939 
actually um they are doing a lot of mod
support<00:00:54.899> for<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.350> i<00:00:55.379> don't<00:00:55.530> know<00:00:55.590> i<00:00:55.620> sound<00:00:55.829> like

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
support for it i don't know i sound like

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.279 
support for it i don't know i sound like
a<00:00:56.070> hill<00:00:56.280> Willy<00:00:56.460> there<00:00:56.670> yeah<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.780> lot<00:00:57.989> of<00:00:58.050> mod

a hill Willy there yeah a lot of mod
support<00:00:58.469> so<00:00:58.859> just<00:00:59.100> imagine<00:00:59.190> what<00:00:59.579> can<00:00:59.730> be<00:00:59.820> done

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
support so just imagine what can be done

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.250 
support so just imagine what can be done
they<00:01:00.149> could<00:01:00.300> turn<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.629> into<00:01:00.660> mountain<00:01:01.050> Glade

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
they could turn it into mountain Glade

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.930 
they could turn it into mountain Glade
where<00:01:01.410> you<00:01:01.590> build<00:01:01.829> your<00:01:02.010> own<00:01:02.070> fucking<00:01:02.460> castles

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
where you build your own fucking castles

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.870 
where you build your own fucking castles
how<00:01:03.120> awesome<00:01:03.390> would<00:01:03.449> that<00:01:03.510> be<00:01:04.040> seems<00:01:05.040> like<00:01:05.760> you

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
how awesome would that be seems like you

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.240 
how awesome would that be seems like you
had<00:01:06.060> occurred<00:01:06.299> bots<00:01:06.510> and<00:01:06.840> shit<00:01:07.680> like<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:07.830> and

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
had occurred bots and shit like that and

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.969 
had occurred bots and shit like that and
now<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:08.729> can<00:01:08.909> create<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.180> system<00:01:09.900> which<00:01:10.830> is

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
now you can create a system which is

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.859 
now you can create a system which is
like<00:01:11.159> ways<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.549> converting<00:01:12.210> force<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.720> do

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
like ways of converting force to do

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.260 
like ways of converting force to do
certain<00:01:13.229> things<00:01:13.260> like<00:01:13.650> draw<00:01:13.920> bridges<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.700> you

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
certain things like draw bridges and you

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.850 
certain things like draw bridges and you
know<00:01:15.420> you<00:01:15.689> can<00:01:15.720> do<00:01:15.930> siege<00:01:16.140> equipment<00:01:16.350> which<00:01:16.710> is

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
know you can do siege equipment which is

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.890 
know you can do siege equipment which is
pretty<00:01:17.159> damn<00:01:17.520> cool<00:01:17.790> I'll<00:01:18.299> be<00:01:18.509> interested<00:01:18.630> to

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
pretty damn cool I'll be interested to

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.649 
pretty damn cool I'll be interested to
see<00:01:19.110> how<00:01:19.380> they<00:01:19.650> incorporate<00:01:20.040> be<00:01:20.580> like<00:01:20.790> energy

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
see how they incorporate be like energy

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.780 
see how they incorporate be like energy
and<00:01:21.860> I'll<00:01:22.860> guess<00:01:23.040> I'll<00:01:23.070> be<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.310> equivalent<00:01:23.520> of

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
and I'll guess I'll be the equivalent of

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.420 
and I'll guess I'll be the equivalent of
electronics<00:01:24.420> in<00:01:24.750> space<00:01:25.080> engine<00:01:25.439> is<00:01:25.590> yes<00:01:26.250> how

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
electronics in space engine is yes how

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.850 
electronics in space engine is yes how
you<00:01:26.490> access<00:01:26.840> terminals<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:28.140> turn<00:01:28.409> things<00:01:28.650> on

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
you access terminals to turn things on

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.249 
you access terminals to turn things on
and<00:01:28.920> stuff<00:01:29.280> oh<00:01:29.520> it'd<00:01:30.450> be<00:01:30.509> pretty<00:01:30.810> hooks<00:01:31.079> I

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
and stuff oh it'd be pretty hooks I

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.539 
and stuff oh it'd be pretty hooks I
think<00:01:31.439> you<00:01:31.530> can<00:01:31.680> actually<00:01:31.799> turn<00:01:32.100> like<00:01:32.430> the

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
think you can actually turn like the

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.280 
think you can actually turn like the
windmill<00:01:32.909> you<00:01:33.119> can<00:01:33.270> actually<00:01:33.509> turn<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:34.200> know

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
windmill you can actually turn you know

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.920 
windmill you can actually turn you know
the<00:01:34.380> kinetic<00:01:34.710> energy<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:35.280> grind<00:01:35.970> up<00:01:36.180> oars<00:01:36.479> as

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
the kinetic energy to grind up oars as

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.330 
the kinetic energy to grind up oars as
well<00:01:37.170> which<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:37.890> know<00:01:38.040> I<00:01:38.600> think<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:39.750> fancy

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
well which you know I think I fancy

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.800 
well which you know I think I fancy
exactly<00:01:41.340> imagine<00:01:41.610> like<00:01:41.759> having<00:01:42.329> sawmills

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
exactly imagine like having sawmills

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.110 
exactly imagine like having sawmills
like<00:01:43.020> in<00:01:43.140> Skyrim<00:01:43.649> shit<00:01:44.640> like<00:01:44.790> that

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:45.120 
like in Skyrim shit like that

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.550 
like in Skyrim shit like that
water<00:01:45.390> males<00:01:45.690> and<00:01:45.870> stuff<00:01:45.990> I<00:01:46.140> don't<00:01:46.440> know<00:01:46.500> if

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
water males and stuff I don't know if

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.690 
water males and stuff I don't know if
they're<00:01:46.680> adding<00:01:46.890> volumetric<00:01:47.220> water<00:01:47.400> they

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
they're adding volumetric water they

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.370 
they're adding volumetric water they
talked<00:01:47.910> about<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.390> so<00:01:48.540> it's<00:01:49.200> very

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
talked about and so it's very

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.440 
talked about and so it's very
complicated<00:01:49.800> to<00:01:50.070> do<00:01:50.190> and<00:01:50.400> it<00:01:50.490> will<00:01:50.640> kill<00:01:50.940> FPS

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
complicated to do and it will kill FPS

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.470 
complicated to do and it will kill FPS
pretty<00:01:51.750> much<00:01:51.960> yeah<00:01:52.790> it's<00:01:53.790> not<00:01:53.880> generally<00:01:54.330> done

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:54.480 
pretty much yeah it's not generally done

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.120 
pretty much yeah it's not generally done
in<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.660> lot<00:01:54.840> of<00:01:54.900> games<00:01:55.080> as<00:01:55.230> a<00:01:55.260> volumetric<00:01:55.710> or<00:01:56.010> is

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
in a lot of games as a volumetric or is

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:57.830 
in a lot of games as a volumetric or is
very<00:01:56.340> confident<00:01:56.730> they<00:01:56.820> know<00:01:57.030> it's<00:01:57.480> a<00:01:57.540> modded

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
very confident they know it's a modded

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.600 
very confident they know it's a modded
fit<00:01:58.050> the<00:01:58.170> troll<00:01:58.350> bridge<00:01:58.380> yeah<00:01:59.310> it<00:01:59.490> can

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
fit the troll bridge yeah it can

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.520 
fit the troll bridge yeah it can
probably<00:01:59.760> be<00:01:59.940> done<00:02:00.090> in<00:02:00.240> modding<00:02:00.570> but<00:02:00.810> it<00:02:01.020> will

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
probably be done in modding but it will

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.550 
probably be done in modding but it will

this<00:02:32.340> bitch<00:02:32.820> quite<00:02:33.030> interesting<00:02:33.360> because

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
this bitch quite interesting because

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.120 
this bitch quite interesting because
he's<00:02:33.660> actually<00:02:33.810> building<00:02:34.530> one<00:02:34.680> on<00:02:34.800> the<00:02:34.890> fly

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
he's actually building one on the fly

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.250 
he's actually building one on the fly
and<00:02:35.490> shows<00:02:36.120> you<00:02:36.270> how<00:02:36.420> light<00:02:36.660> you<00:02:36.780> know<00:02:36.900> certain

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
and shows you how light you know certain

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.190 
and shows you how light you know certain
materials<00:02:37.770> can<00:02:37.890> snap<00:02:38.160> together<00:02:38.310> which<00:02:39.200> pretty

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
materials can snap together which pretty

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.890 
materials can snap together which pretty
damn<00:02:40.470> cool<00:02:40.770> I<00:02:41.070> wonder<00:02:41.910> whether<00:02:42.060> you<00:02:42.630> have<00:02:42.780> to

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
damn cool I wonder whether you have to

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.720 
damn cool I wonder whether you have to
build<00:02:43.080> from<00:02:43.230> certain<00:02:43.680> pre-designed<00:02:44.370> patterns

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
build from certain pre-designed patterns

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:46.160 
build from certain pre-designed patterns
or<00:02:44.880> whether<00:02:45.000> it's<00:02:45.180> completely<00:02:45.810> that's<00:02:45.960> what<00:02:46.140> I

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
or whether it's completely that's what I

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.990 
or whether it's completely that's what I
was<00:02:46.320> thinking<00:02:46.740> but<00:02:46.920> it<00:02:47.040> looks<00:02:47.340> pretty<00:02:47.580> open

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
was thinking but it looks pretty open

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.550 
was thinking but it looks pretty open
doesn't<00:02:48.270> it<00:02:48.330> really<00:02:48.600> and<00:02:48.750> I've<00:02:48.840> seen<00:02:49.020> some<00:02:49.290> it

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
doesn't it really and I've seen some it

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.040 
doesn't it really and I've seen some it
does<00:02:50.239> by<00:02:51.239> some<00:02:51.390> other<00:02:51.480> people<00:02:51.840> well<00:02:51.959> they

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
does by some other people well they

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.170 
does by some other people well they
showed<00:02:52.290> that<00:02:52.500> some<00:02:53.070> of<00:02:53.130> the<00:02:53.220> designs<00:02:53.550> don't

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
showed that some of the designs don't

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.820 
showed that some of the designs don't
really<00:02:54.450> work<00:02:54.630> and<00:02:54.900> you<00:02:55.170> can<00:02:55.290> pretty<00:02:55.470> much<00:02:55.560> do

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
really work and you can pretty much do

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.740 
really work and you can pretty much do
what<00:02:55.920> you<00:02:55.980> want<00:02:56.190> I<00:02:56.370> hear<00:02:57.209> it's<00:02:57.300> very<00:02:57.420> tight

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
what you want I hear it's very tight

can see the Rope mechanics as well or
