with<00:00:26.670> Matt<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.359> that<00:00:27.779> what<00:00:28.080> are<00:00:28.260> you<00:00:28.439> doing

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
with Matt and that what are you doing

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.400 
with Matt and that what are you doing
right<00:00:29.160> now<00:00:29.539> right<00:00:30.539> now<00:00:30.689> I'm<00:00:30.840> making<00:00:31.170> what<00:00:31.199> we

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
right now right now I'm making what we

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.160 
right now right now I'm making what we
call<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:31.650> surface<00:00:32.130> analysis<00:00:32.759> every<00:00:33.750> hour<00:00:33.899> we

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
call a surface analysis every hour we

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.810 
call a surface analysis every hour we
get<00:00:34.350> observations<00:00:35.070> from<00:00:35.219> all<00:00:35.430> over<00:00:35.610> the

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
get observations from all over the

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.420 
get observations from all over the
country<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.420> I'm<00:00:36.960> just<00:00:37.440> simply<00:00:37.649> drawing<00:00:38.190> in

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
country and I'm just simply drawing in

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.220 
country and I'm just simply drawing in
the<00:00:38.460> pressure<00:00:38.760> lines<00:00:39.090> on<00:00:39.329> these<00:00:39.480> observations

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
the pressure lines on these observations

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.350 
the pressure lines on these observations
so<00:00:41.100> that<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.219> can<00:00:41.280> get<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.520> handle<00:00:41.879> on<00:00:42.000> what<00:00:42.239> the

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
so that I can get a handle on what the

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.549 
so that I can get a handle on what the
weather's<00:00:42.629> doing<00:00:42.809> right<00:00:43.110> now<00:00:43.290> which

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
weather's doing right now which

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.229 
weather's doing right now which
obviously<00:00:43.950> is<00:00:44.309> what<00:00:44.489> we're<00:00:44.640> going<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:44.910> need<00:00:45.059> in

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
obviously is what we're going to need in

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.580 
obviously is what we're going to need in
order<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.480> figure<00:00:45.809> out<00:00:45.930> what<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.320> weather<00:00:46.500> is

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
order to figure out what the weather is

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.170 
order to figure out what the weather is
going<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.829> be<00:00:46.890> doing<00:00:47.070> in<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.370> future<00:00:47.399> now

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
going to be doing in the future now

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.240 
going to be doing in the future now
looking<00:00:48.570> at<00:00:48.690> all<00:00:48.930> these<00:00:49.200> computers<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:50.070> is

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
looking at all these computers it is

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.069 
looking at all these computers it is
very<00:00:50.489> high-tech<00:00:51.120> it<00:00:51.360> is<00:00:51.510> definitely<00:00:51.780> a

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
very high-tech it is definitely a

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.529 
very high-tech it is definitely a
science<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:52.860> in<00:00:53.489> fact<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.969> little<00:00:54.210> bit<00:00:54.360> of<00:00:54.449> an

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
science and in fact a little bit of an

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.900 
science and in fact a little bit of an
art<00:00:54.840> how<00:00:55.320> has<00:00:55.649> it<00:00:55.680> been<00:00:55.890> for<00:00:56.010> you<00:00:56.309> folks<00:00:56.610> this

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
art how has it been for you folks this

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.970 
art how has it been for you folks this
week<00:00:57.180> with<00:00:57.390> all<00:00:57.629> of<00:00:57.840> these<00:00:57.960> storms<00:00:58.410> moving<00:00:58.710> in

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
week with all of these storms moving in

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.299 
week with all of these storms moving in
it's<00:00:59.699> been<00:00:59.940> very<00:00:59.969> challenging<00:01:00.530> but<00:01:01.530> this<00:01:02.160> is

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
it's been very challenging but this is

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.000 
it's been very challenging but this is
what<00:01:02.489> we<00:01:02.609> live<00:01:02.789> for<00:01:02.850> this<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:03.719> what<00:01:03.930> what<00:01:04.890> we've

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
what we live for this is what what we've

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.060 
what we live for this is what what we've
always<00:01:05.189> wanted<00:01:05.460> to<00:01:05.700> do<00:01:05.850> and<00:01:06.119> when<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:07.040> have<00:01:08.040> a

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
always wanted to do and when you have a

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.950 
always wanted to do and when you have a
challenging<00:01:08.580> situation<00:01:08.760> like<00:01:09.330> this<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.570> test

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
challenging situation like this a test

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.190 
challenging situation like this a test
your<00:01:10.170> skills<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.909> sometimes<00:01:11.960> sometimes<00:01:12.960> we

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
your skills and sometimes sometimes we

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.380 
your skills and sometimes sometimes we
come<00:01:14.189> up<00:01:14.310> a<00:01:14.369> little<00:01:14.460> short<00:01:14.610> but<00:01:14.970> most<00:01:15.180> of<00:01:15.330> the

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
come up a little short but most of the

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.630 
come up a little short but most of the
time<00:01:15.570> we<00:01:15.689> do<00:01:15.810> pretty<00:01:15.990> good<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.740> we<00:01:17.220> take<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.430> lot

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
time we do pretty good and we take a lot

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.870 
time we do pretty good and we take a lot
of<00:01:17.700> pride<00:01:17.970> in<00:01:18.000> what<00:01:18.240> we<00:01:18.270> do<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.720> we<00:01:19.110> try<00:01:19.409> to

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
of pride in what we do and we try to

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.310 
of pride in what we do and we try to
learn<00:01:20.880> from<00:01:21.090> our<00:01:21.240> mistakes<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.960> do<00:01:22.140> better

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
learn from our mistakes and do better

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.649 
learn from our mistakes and do better
the<00:01:22.500> next<00:01:22.530> time<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:23.220> actually<00:01:23.970> we<00:01:24.210> have<00:01:24.390> about

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
the next time and actually we have about

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.170 
the next time and actually we have about
a<00:01:24.720> seventy<00:01:25.590> percent<00:01:25.740> accuracy<00:01:26.520> rate<00:01:26.880> when<00:01:27.090> we

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
a seventy percent accuracy rate when we

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.359 
a seventy percent accuracy rate when we
talk<00:01:27.420> about<00:01:27.450> winter<00:01:28.020> storms<00:01:28.380> coming<00:01:28.710> there's

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
talk about winter storms coming there's

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.710 
talk about winter storms coming there's
about<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.610> seven<00:01:29.909> percent<00:01:30.210> chance<00:01:30.420> we're<00:01:30.630> going

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
about a seven percent chance we're going

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.109 
about a seven percent chance we're going
to<00:01:30.810> be<00:01:30.900> right<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:31.350> you're<00:01:31.500> going<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.650> get<00:01:31.829> hit

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
to be right and you're going to get hit

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:34.670 
to be right and you're going to get hit
now<00:01:33.119> speaking<00:01:33.750> of<00:01:33.840> when<00:01:34.110> we're<00:01:34.320> going<00:01:34.439> to<00:01:34.530> get

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
now speaking of when we're going to get

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.609 
now speaking of when we're going to get
hit<00:01:34.950> looking<00:01:35.640> at<00:01:35.790> this<00:01:36.090> computer<00:01:36.750> model<00:01:37.140> right

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
hit looking at this computer model right

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.380 
hit looking at this computer model right
here<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:38.009> looks<00:01:38.220> like<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.490> East<00:01:38.670> Coast<00:01:38.909> is

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
here it looks like the East Coast is
