00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.789 
liquid to matte lipsticks but not as
opaque<00:01:51.000> as<00:01:51.240> those<00:01:51.570> I<00:01:51.990> think<00:01:52.229> these<00:01:52.350> are<00:01:52.409> more

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
opaque as those I think these are more

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.539 
opaque as those I think these are more
natural-looking<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.850> more<00:01:55.070> you<00:01:56.070> can<00:01:56.310> barely

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
natural-looking and more you can barely

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.999 
natural-looking and more you can barely
feel<00:01:56.729> these<00:01:57.090> on<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.390> lips<00:01:57.570> on<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.229> lips<00:01:58.409> so

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
feel these on the lips on the lips so

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.440 
feel these on the lips on the lips so
these<00:01:59.219> are<00:01:59.460> super<00:01:59.790> different<00:01:59.969> comfortable

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
these are super different comfortable

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.569 
these are super different comfortable
