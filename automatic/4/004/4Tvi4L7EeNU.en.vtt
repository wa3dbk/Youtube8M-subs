hands I don't really have that kind of

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:32.710 
hands I don't really have that kind of
problem<00:02:31.010> I<00:02:31.190> think<00:02:31.579> I<00:02:31.640> just<00:02:31.670> the<00:02:32.209> texture<00:02:32.510> is<00:02:32.690> a

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
problem I think I just the texture is a

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.350 
problem I think I just the texture is a
little<00:02:32.870> weird<00:02:33.319> but<00:02:34.069> actually<00:02:34.910> it<00:02:35.030> tastes<00:02:35.299> like

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
little weird but actually it tastes like

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.009 
little weird but actually it tastes like
what<00:02:35.750> it<00:02:35.810> smells<00:02:36.170> to<00:02:36.709> me<00:02:36.860> yeah<00:02:37.819> but<00:02:38.150> I<00:02:38.780> guess

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
what it smells to me yeah but I guess

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:40.000 
what it smells to me yeah but I guess
it's<00:02:39.170> just<00:02:39.290> a<00:02:39.349> personal<00:02:39.620> thing<00:02:39.680> whether<00:02:39.890> you

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
it's just a personal thing whether you

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.250 
it's just a personal thing whether you
like<00:02:40.220> it<00:02:40.250> or<00:02:40.400> not<00:02:40.519> so<00:02:40.579> I<00:02:40.970> think<00:02:41.569> honestly

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
like it or not so I think honestly

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.350 
like it or not so I think honestly
because<00:02:42.620> just<00:02:43.400> because<00:02:43.549> the<00:02:43.700> texture<00:02:44.120> is<00:02:44.209> so

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
because just because the texture is so

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.750 
because just because the texture is so
weird<00:02:44.829> that<00:02:45.829> would<00:02:46.220> obviously<00:02:46.340> bring<00:02:46.670> a

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
weird that would obviously bring a

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.150 
weird that would obviously bring a
rating<00:02:47.239> down<00:02:47.390> a<00:02:47.420> lot<00:02:48.069> but<00:02:49.150> as<00:02:50.150> far<00:02:50.450> as<00:02:50.569> the

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
rating down a lot but as far as the

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.309 
rating down a lot but as far as the
actual<00:02:52.160> flavor<00:02:52.579> goes<00:02:52.700> like<00:02:52.850> if<00:02:52.970> this<00:02:53.090> is<00:02:53.150> a

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
actual flavor goes like if this is a

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:55.960 
actual flavor goes like if this is a
like<00:02:54.319> a<00:02:54.350> thinner<00:02:54.859> milkshake<00:02:55.489> type<00:02:55.730> thing<00:02:55.940> like

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
like a thinner milkshake type thing like

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.750 
like a thinner milkshake type thing like
like<00:02:56.690> the<00:02:56.959> nutriment<00:02:57.709> I<00:02:57.950> could<00:02:58.519> see<00:02:58.639> this

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
like the nutriment I could see this

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.539 
like the nutriment I could see this
being<00:02:58.940> not<00:02:59.150> too<00:02:59.299> bad<00:02:59.480> but<00:02:59.870> edgy<00:03:00.109> cool<00:03:00.459> but<00:03:01.459> the

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
being not too bad but edgy cool but the

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:04.000 
being not too bad but edgy cool but the
way<00:03:01.670> it<00:03:01.790> is<00:03:01.880> I'm<00:03:01.970> gonna<00:03:02.120> give<00:03:02.239> that<00:03:02.269> as<00:03:03.010> six

way it is I'm gonna give that as six

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.009 
way it is I'm gonna give that as six
