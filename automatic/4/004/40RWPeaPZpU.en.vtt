00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
did not test these products before they

to<00:05:00.040> so<00:05:00.639> for<00:05:01.030> example<00:05:01.479> if<00:05:01.630> you<00:05:01.720> look<00:05:01.870> at<00:05:01.960> the

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
to so for example if you look at the

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.240 
to so for example if you look at the

years ago almost 20 years ago you're

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.520 
years ago almost 20 years ago you're
seeing<00:05:07.090> a<00:05:07.180> rise<00:05:07.360> in<00:05:07.389> all<00:05:07.780> kinds<00:05:08.260> of<00:05:08.350> health

problems<00:05:08.620> not<00:05:09.070> just<00:05:09.130> obesity<00:05:09.760> but<00:05:10.060> obesity<00:05:10.630> is

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
problems not just obesity but obesity is

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.650 
problems not just obesity but obesity is
rather<00:05:11.229> interesting<00:05:11.800> because<00:05:12.419> 90<00:05:13.419> the

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:13.660 
rather interesting because 90 the

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.510 
rather interesting because 90 the
percentage<00:05:14.080> of<00:05:14.139> Americans<00:05:14.710> of<00:05:14.979> obese

percentage of Americans of obese

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.150 
percentage of Americans of obese
Americans<00:05:16.000> shot<00:05:16.240> up<00:05:16.389> by<00:05:16.510> 90<00:05:16.990> percent<00:05:17.160> since

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 
Americans shot up by 90 percent since

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.760 
Americans shot up by 90 percent since
the<00:05:18.310> introduction<00:05:18.940> of<00:05:19.000> GMOs<00:05:19.690> to<00:05:20.260> the<00:05:20.410> American

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
the introduction of GMOs to the American

food supply

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:23.190 
food supply
Wow<00:05:21.760> so<00:05:22.000> there<00:05:22.150> seems<00:05:22.479> to<00:05:22.630> be<00:05:22.750> at<00:05:22.900> least<00:05:23.050> a

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:23.200 
Wow so there seems to be at least a

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.750 
Wow so there seems to be at least a
pretty<00:05:23.440> obvious<00:05:23.590> correlation<00:05:24.430> there<00:05:24.580> and

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:24.760 
pretty obvious correlation there and

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.060 
pretty obvious correlation there and
talk<00:05:24.970> about<00:05:25.240> obesity<00:05:25.840> in<00:05:26.139> America<00:05:26.560> in

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.070 
talk about obesity in America in

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:28.590 
talk about obesity in America in
relation<00:05:27.490> to<00:05:27.520> the<00:05:27.699> rise<00:05:27.880> of<00:05:28.060> the<00:05:28.180> GMOs

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:28.600 
relation to the rise of the GMOs

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.110 
relation to the rise of the GMOs
definitely<00:05:29.380> well<00:05:29.590> in<00:05:29.800> the<00:05:29.889> past<00:05:30.130> 20<00:05:30.580> years<00:05:30.610> so

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 
definitely well in the past 20 years so

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.450 
definitely well in the past 20 years so
you<00:05:31.450> know<00:05:31.570> 20<00:05:32.050> years<00:05:32.080> ago<00:05:32.440> there<00:05:32.950> were<00:05:33.100> no

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
you know 20 years ago there were no

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.090 
you know 20 years ago there were no
states<00:05:33.970> that<00:05:34.180> had<00:05:34.330> obesity<00:05:34.810> rates<00:05:34.990> over<00:05:35.320> 20%

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:36.100 
states that had obesity rates over 20%

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:39.450 
states that had obesity rates over 20%
today<00:05:36.700> there<00:05:37.180> are<00:05:37.300> 38<00:05:37.900> states<00:05:38.500> with<00:05:39.070> obesity

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:39.460 
today there are 38 states with obesity

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.930 
today there are 38 states with obesity
numbers<00:05:40.300> over<00:05:40.750> 25%<00:05:41.590> so<00:05:42.280> you<00:05:42.340> can<00:05:42.460> see<00:05:42.610> the<00:05:42.729> rate

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:42.940 
numbers over 25% so you can see the rate

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:45.180 
numbers over 25% so you can see the rate
at<00:05:43.120> which<00:05:43.320> obesity<00:05:44.320> has<00:05:44.470> risen<00:05:44.680> and<00:05:44.889> also

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.190 
at which obesity has risen and also

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:47.460 
at which obesity has risen and also
lower-income<00:05:45.610> communities<00:05:45.910> using<00:05:46.840> obesity

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:47.470 
lower-income communities using obesity

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:49.379 
lower-income communities using obesity
rates<00:05:47.680> just<00:05:47.950> skyrocket<00:05:48.580> African<00:05:48.970> American

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:49.389 
rates just skyrocket African American

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:51.240 
rates just skyrocket African American
native<00:05:49.720> and<00:05:50.050> Latino<00:05:50.470> communities<00:05:50.979> why<00:05:51.190> is

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.250 
native and Latino communities why is

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.040 
native and Latino communities why is
that<00:05:51.430> it's<00:05:51.820> the<00:05:52.000> source<00:05:52.539> of<00:05:52.750> food<00:05:52.900> that

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.050 
that it's the source of food that

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:54.750 
that it's the source of food that
they're<00:05:53.229> eating<00:05:53.260> selective<00:05:54.250> foods<00:05:54.520> in

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:54.760 
they're eating selective foods in

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.879 
they're eating selective foods in
selective<00:05:55.510> neighborhoods<00:05:56.080> so<00:05:56.590> as<00:05:56.710> you're

00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:56.889 
selective neighborhoods so as you're

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:58.469 
selective neighborhoods so as you're
