00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
i'm not really sure what does that

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.349 
i'm not really sure what does that
exactly<00:03:20.389> means<00:03:21.260> either<00:03:21.500> so<00:03:22.489> looking<00:03:23.180> at<00:03:23.269> the

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:23.359 
exactly means either so looking at the

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:26.289 
exactly means either so looking at the
cards<00:03:23.720> now<00:03:23.870> they<00:03:24.079> are<00:03:24.319> really<00:03:24.650> knew<00:03:25.340> as<00:03:25.670> when

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
cards now they are really knew as when

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:30.190 
cards now they are really knew as when
see<00:03:26.510> there<00:03:27.280> it's<00:03:28.280> a<00:03:28.370> bit<00:03:28.549> different<00:03:28.760> I<00:03:29.200> pretty

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
see there it's a bit different I pretty

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.650 
see there it's a bit different I pretty
don't<00:03:30.440> like<00:03:30.709> the<00:03:30.980> new<00:03:31.250> version<00:03:32.060> of<00:03:32.239> the<00:03:32.299> cards

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
don't like the new version of the cards

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.349 
don't like the new version of the cards
but<00:03:32.750> I<00:03:32.930> think<00:03:33.200> it<00:03:33.350> will<00:03:33.500> do<00:03:33.709> so<00:03:34.670> we<00:03:34.819> have<00:03:34.970> here

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:35.359 
but I think it will do so we have here

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:39.190 
but I think it will do so we have here
some<00:03:36.079> new<00:03:36.200> characters<00:03:37.540> so<00:03:38.540> anyways<00:03:38.989> we're
