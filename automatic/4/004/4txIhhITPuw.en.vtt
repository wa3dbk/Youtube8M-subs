 legendary sports car battle and so on 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.590

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:20.509

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:24.200

00:00:28.309 --> 00:00:32.059
 not exactly known but man 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.110

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.520
 the day here in go merry my 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.960
 but we have to be very short 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.789
 times to hear the rules firmly because 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.649
 he cheated last time sebastian 

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:44.449
 and then with four cars you become so 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.910
 You can only have three cars today 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:48.949
 suggest here your opinion the 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.510

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:52.370
 be approved and the highest ps number 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.100
 wins agree so no 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:59.059

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.830
 concept but here already clear that the 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.540

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.110
 Thankfully , it's time again 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:17.480

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.420

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.580

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:30.320
 concept still and you have to say 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.350

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.170

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.220
