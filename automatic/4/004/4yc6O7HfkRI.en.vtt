00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:07.180
 this video is made especially for 

00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:09.370
 all those lovely girls that end up 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.870
 of entering the makeup world what 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.770
 first thing you have to do is wash 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.890
 your hands well 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:17.769
 Then wash your face and after drying it 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:20.650
 apply a moisturizer and leave it 

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:23.249
 on your face before makeup for 10 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.249
 minutes 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:30.649
 we continue with the frame er the first is the 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:33.260
 base of the base is a creampie that's going 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:36.879
 to put all the skin super soft and going to 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.879
 disappear your pores 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.800
 ah 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.200
 Take your time and really try to 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.660
 find the perfect color for your 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.000
 Natural skin color reminds that the 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.160
 base is what is going to make all 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.500
 our applied the same color is not 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.110
 to create a mask of another color in 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.320
 our face we blur with our fingers 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.540
 making circular movements and 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.770
 trying to make everything all everything 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.649
 stay the same 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.840
 This effect is called a triangle of lights 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:13.240
 is to apply your concealer below 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.240
 of your eyes in triangular shape and 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:19.299
 blur it with your fingers in this case 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:22.030
 tapping and trying not to 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:25.149
 there is only one circle above the ojera 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.280
 if we can not blur it by taking 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:30.330
 corrector a little bit down and towards 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.040
 the hair line 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.870
 ah 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.540
 do not 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:39.920
 the function of translucent loose powder 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.780
 is to seal all the creams that we put 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.090
 above and do not add any color 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.760
 We are going to need a broach 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.580
 apply the powder and we will apply it with 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:53.580
 little touches 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:56.220
 we move to the eyebrows the eyebrows are the 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.160
 frame of our face so it's super 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.470
 important combs add a 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.620
 little shade or some product of 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.420
 eyebrows to fill in the empty spaces and 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.360
 then it is very important that you apply 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.890
 a gel so that your crimes always 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.890
 are in the same place 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.890
 with the bronzer we are going to add 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.990
 shadows on our face we will need 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.360
 a brochita and we will place it for 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:26.540
 that is flat and we are going to do 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.090
 some lines on the sides and then to 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.580
 blur everything so that our cheekbones 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.950
 are marked and that looks super nice 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.290
 supersonic the same thing we're going to do 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.960
 with our nose we are going to put two 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.060
 strips from the eyebrows down and 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.730
 we are also going to blur that very very 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.340
 well the idea is that the stripes do not 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:49.010
 noten we put a little bit in our 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.440
 front in the contour of our hair 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.100
 and then we will also put a little 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.190
 under our chin 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:59.880
 the flush the blush will make us see much more 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.740
 healthy chooses a rosita and smiles 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.680
 applying it on the apples of your 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:07.900
 cheeks but blurring it back 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:11.650
 you do not want two balls to be seen 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:14.230
 pink because it would not look pretty 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:17.260
 we apply black mascara in 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.209
 our upper lashes with a lot 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.610
 Carefully and slowly not to do 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.890
 no disaster we do it up 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.620
 so they are long and then from the 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.870
 root so that the entire tab is full 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.209
 of mascara do not forget that you can apply 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:36.209
 mascara on the lashes below and this is 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:36.209
 what you are going to do is open your eyes more 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.060
 we finish the look with a lipstick or 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:44.879
 gloss gloss to give that final touch 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.310
 to our lips remember to follow the 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:49.290
 natural form of your lips and that's 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.540
 all the makeup is super simple 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.760
 super easy nobody takes practice 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.319
 do the first so do not worry 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.099
