 casino staff begins to panic 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.229
 they do not know what has hit them 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:24.520
 they are confused if forum that is cheating have no idea how 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.339

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:37.789
 all and that if we go 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.229
 so after about 45 minutes they had enough and they kicked me out 

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:49.409
 they go to other casinos and each one looks like a pattern

 even though these are not being anything except use their ingenuity the casinos 

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.820
 they can expel any player even if they only suspect that they 

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:28.050
 trap and that's precisely what the casinos suspect is happening 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.680
