basically<00:00:52.140> just<00:00:52.260> saw<00:00:52.649> was<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.250> modification<00:00:54.090> to

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
basically just saw was a modification to

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.220 
basically just saw was a modification to
the<00:00:54.930> PBY<00:00:55.320> this<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.579> dynam<00:00:56.940> catalina<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.780> lot

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
the PBY this is the dynam catalina a lot

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.500 
the PBY this is the dynam catalina a lot
of<00:00:58.379> guys<00:00:58.530> had<00:00:58.770> out<00:00:59.070> there<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.579> always<00:01:00.120> wanted

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
of guys had out there and always wanted

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.650 
of guys had out there and always wanted
to<00:01:00.660> have<00:01:01.260> retractable<00:01:01.949> wheels<00:01:02.190> well<00:01:02.550> I<00:01:02.789> don't

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
to have retractable wheels well I don't

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.750 
to have retractable wheels well I don't
think<00:01:03.690> that's<00:01:03.930> going<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.229> really<00:01:04.409> happen<00:01:04.760> from

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
think that's going to really happen from

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.700 
think that's going to really happen from
the<00:01:05.880> manufacturers<00:01:06.720> so<00:01:06.960> I<00:01:07.200> took<00:01:07.439> it<00:01:07.619> upon

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
the manufacturers so I took it upon

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.910 
the manufacturers so I took it upon
myself<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.900> grab<00:01:09.900> an<00:01:10.080> O<00:01:10.200> one<00:01:10.380> out<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.740> back

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
myself to grab an O one out of the back

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.210 
myself to grab an O one out of the back
that<00:01:11.060> Antonio<00:01:12.060> had<00:01:12.570> actually<00:01:13.290> used<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.710> just

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
that Antonio had actually used and just

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.710 
that Antonio had actually used and just
modify<00:01:14.460> it<00:01:14.760> I<00:01:15.720> added<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.820> wheel<00:01:17.820> as<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.570> can

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
modify it I added the wheel as you can

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.560 
modify it I added the wheel as you can
tell<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.200> this<00:01:19.409> is<00:01:19.590> just<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.979> light<00:01:20.310> fly<00:01:20.580> sealed

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
tell and this is just a light fly sealed

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.440 
tell and this is just a light fly sealed
with<00:01:21.869> silicone<00:01:22.590> right<00:01:23.430> here<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.700> prevent<00:01:24.299> the

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
with silicone right here to prevent the

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.260 
with silicone right here to prevent the
water<00:01:24.600> from<00:01:24.750> leaking<00:01:25.020> in<00:01:25.640> later<00:01:26.640> on<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:26.880> plan<00:01:27.240> to

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
water from leaking in later on I plan to

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.899 
water from leaking in later on I plan to
put<00:01:27.540> some<00:01:27.770> polyurethane<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:28.920> as<00:01:29.430> after

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
put some polyurethane and as after

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.330 
put some polyurethane and as after
thought<00:01:30.060> I<00:01:30.200> realized<00:01:31.200> I<00:01:31.409> could<00:01:31.770> abuse<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.189> piece

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
thought I realized I could abuse a piece

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.190 
thought I realized I could abuse a piece
of<00:01:32.460> plastic<00:01:32.909> which<00:01:33.479> actually<00:01:34.020> went

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
of plastic which actually went

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.920 
of plastic which actually went
waterproof<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.820> we<00:01:35.939> also<00:01:36.090> just<00:01:36.390> leftover

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
waterproof the we also just leftover

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.980 
waterproof the we also just leftover
from<00:01:37.140> on<00:01:37.350> another<00:01:38.100> airplane<00:01:38.600> one<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:39.780> half

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
from on another airplane one and a half

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.130 
from on another airplane one and a half
inch<00:01:40.200> screws<00:01:40.590> with<00:01:40.920> some<00:01:41.220> nuts<00:01:42.090> locking<00:01:42.899> nuts

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
inch screws with some nuts locking nuts

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.090 
inch screws with some nuts locking nuts
the<00:01:43.680> end<00:01:43.829> you<00:01:43.920> can<00:01:44.070> see<00:01:44.100> they<00:01:44.310> move<00:01:44.460> freely<00:01:44.729> on

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
the end you can see they move freely on

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.609 
the end you can see they move freely on
the<00:01:47.100> tail<00:01:47.280> section<00:01:47.579> I<00:01:48.049> just<00:01:49.049> made<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.320> bent

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
the tail section I just made a bent

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.520 
the tail section I just made a bent
piece<00:01:49.799> of<00:01:50.009> wire<00:01:50.189> and<00:01:50.490> just<00:01:51.149> use<00:01:52.049> some<00:01:52.229> screws

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
piece of wire and just use some screws

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.200 
piece of wire and just use some screws
and<00:01:52.560> put<00:01:52.860> it<00:01:52.950> onto<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.369> rudder<00:01:53.549> now<00:01:53.790> if<00:01:53.939> I<00:01:54.030> want

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
and put it onto the rudder now if I want

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.800 
and put it onto the rudder now if I want
to<00:01:54.270> take<00:01:54.509> this<00:01:54.659> off<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.439> fly<00:01:55.890> in<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.600> NDL<00:01:57.630> off

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
to take this off and fly in the NDL off

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.420 
to take this off and fly in the NDL off
of<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.170> water<00:01:58.380> I<00:01:58.619> could<00:01:58.950> just<00:01:59.100> take<00:01:59.250> these

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
of the water I could just take these

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.060 
of the water I could just take these
screws<00:01:59.729> off<00:01:59.909> take<00:02:00.570> this<00:02:00.780> take<00:02:01.380> this<00:02:01.560> nut<00:02:01.890> and

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
screws off take this take this nut and

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.670 
screws off take this take this nut and
just<00:02:02.100> screw<00:02:02.640> up<00:02:02.850> on<00:02:03.299> both<00:02:03.659> sides<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.140> that's

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
just screw up on both sides and that's

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:05.090 
just screw up on both sides and that's
it

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
it

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.520 
it
this<00:02:05.369> would<00:02:05.700> act<00:02:05.909> like<00:02:06.210> almost<00:02:06.600> like<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:06.840> like

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
this would act like almost like a like

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.900 
this would act like almost like a like
up<00:02:08.179> essentially<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.330> a<00:02:10.430> center<00:02:11.430> board<00:02:11.670> on<00:02:11.879> a

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
up essentially a a center board on a

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.430 
up essentially a a center board on a
sailboat<00:02:12.270> but

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
sailboat but

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.660 
sailboat but
of<00:02:13.590> course<00:02:13.770> we'll<00:02:13.890> be<00:02:13.920> here<00:02:14.190> and<00:02:14.340> this<00:02:14.520> will

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
of course we'll be here and this will

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.300 
of course we'll be here and this will
actually<00:02:14.790> stabilize<00:02:15.510> it<00:02:15.690> in<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:16.230> water<00:02:16.410> the

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
actually stabilize it in the water the

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.640 
actually stabilize it in the water the
actual<00:02:17.670> pvy<00:02:18.210> was<00:02:18.750> actually<00:02:19.050> tricycle<00:02:19.620> landing

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
actual pvy was actually tricycle landing

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.400 
actual pvy was actually tricycle landing
gear<00:02:20.040> so<00:02:20.820> they<00:02:21.060> had<00:02:21.210> a<00:02:21.240> the<00:02:21.750> gear<00:02:21.930> came<00:02:22.110> out<00:02:22.290> of

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
gear so they had a the gear came out of

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.340 
gear so they had a the gear came out of
the<00:02:22.500> nose<00:02:22.680> well<00:02:23.460> I<00:02:23.640> can<00:02:23.850> tell<00:02:24.030> you<00:02:24.090> that's<00:02:24.210> not

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
the nose well I can tell you that's not

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.630 
the nose well I can tell you that's not
going<00:02:25.350> to<00:02:25.410> happen<00:02:25.770> from<00:02:25.830> the<00:02:25.920> manufacturer

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
going to happen from the manufacturer

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.640 
going to happen from the manufacturer
because<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:27.240> integrity<00:02:27.840> of<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:28.110> holes<00:02:28.350> now

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
because the integrity of the holes now

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.850 
because the integrity of the holes now
can<00:02:28.890> be<00:02:28.920> compromised<00:02:29.900> anyway<00:02:30.900> I<00:02:31.110> thought<00:02:31.800> I

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
can be compromised anyway I thought I

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.460 
can be compromised anyway I thought I
