00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:05.480
 cherokee key talk a lot now 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.719
 board 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:12.420
 I'll tell you right away that for standard 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.130
 human wide board used in 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.130
 for the purpose of making it easier on her corner 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.500
 will land after a file for example about what 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.439
 you make a fleet list and that is on 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:26.519
 wider easier to land 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:35.040
 the narrower board is easy to spin and easy 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:37.640
 make gripes so not everyone's business for 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.559
 standard person 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.809
 choose a board itself not the size 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.020
 too big was useful for you 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.559
 too small now i will show you 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.559
 example on 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:58.879
 remember my board terema ah what is the most 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:09.140
 My lovely 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:09.140
 pies board and here is my burkina 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:18.940
 that is, so that the crust is hanging 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:23.770
 a centimeter by 4 5 that the cubes also 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:27.790
 became farther it was with your feet hanging there 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:31.300
 I would also not understand the exchange 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:33.850
 acquaintances have a dude he's tall and him 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.010
 gave a little creak ride like that 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.770
 he couldn't do what he needed me 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:42.010
 here many are just the length of men 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:47.430
 No chest so choose yourself 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:47.430
 board size no cherokee 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:57.450
 After all, this board all work on she now 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.450
 me to use 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:09.070
 further other 10 crack shorter than you understand 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:12.490
 and when you get up like that from above on 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:22.780
 which naturally begins to stratify 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:26.610
 things are no more than these doses 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:29.739
 hooks are used to presented 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:34.630
 so the second board in size and need 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:37.890
 same by the way, see when 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:43.090
 you collect skate or buy to 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:44.950
 suspension did not go preferably for now 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.930
 these sides are something like this 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.580
 the distance was not to 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:57.630
 bulging in wheels 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:57.630
 here or too need so second board 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:12.850
 board also sandpaper element not like 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:17.020
 or is it more small I search better 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:20.049
 all complicated and two more that is they are simpler 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:22.440
 learn to spin not on landing 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:27.180
 of course after that on a narrow board 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:29.360
 not really an option on but still twist 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.360
 and 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:38.610
 I saw the board so to speak 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:43.470
 everyday board normal 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:45.960
 I really like the size of things and we 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:53.280
 just all sizes on it but also under 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:59.490
 everything right is convenient and good so what else 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:04:02.250
 I wanted to say I grease the bearings 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:04.400
 olive oil and either sunny so 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.110
 love 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:11.790
 no really and not wanted to say 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:13.770
 and all your skin by the way too 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:17.269
 priperlis buy a new skin and 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:22.620
 it is very easy for client to stick 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:25.010
 opens old skin on horseradish parts 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.010
 man 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:39.340
 In short, the old skin comes off the bread 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.840
 preferably pasted over 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:49.690
 unscrew the suspension so that it was convenient for you 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:54.490
 do everything when you blew the skin 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:58.240
 stick on top exactly this chicken 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:05:00.980
 then with a file or 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:03.380
 press start to glue on the side and 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:07.580
 pressing so that you don't have bubbles 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:13.570
 glue on every bark 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:17.300
 Penechka is a little thing around the edges. 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:19.370
 ios worth the huge success then take 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:22.880
 distress or little knife and careful 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:29.840
 srezhet cut and then remains 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:39.500
 sandpaper brother of the river is generally a plan so 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:40.600
 that everything seems to be what I wanted to say 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:44.560
 taught to leave 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.560
 wannabiz all happy and
