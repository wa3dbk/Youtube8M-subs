00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
six nine point seven k so you know we've

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.900 
six nine point seven k so you know we've
got<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:55.770> higher<00:00:55.949> chance<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.309> quite<00:00:56.520> across<00:00:56.730> an

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
got a higher chance of quite across an

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.639 
got a higher chance of quite across an
inner<00:00:57.090> form<00:00:57.449> now<00:00:57.870> we<00:00:57.930> put<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.140> maximum<00:00:58.440> prices

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
inner form now we put the maximum prices

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.939 
inner form now we put the maximum prices
15k<00:00:59.250> basically<00:00:59.760> because<00:01:00.090> you<00:01:00.780> know<00:01:00.899> we<00:01:01.829> don't

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
15k basically because you know we don't

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.319 
15k basically because you know we don't
have<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.190> most<00:01:02.340> point<00:01:02.609> in<00:01:02.789> I<00:01:02.850> believe<00:01:02.910> we<00:01:03.210> have

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
have the most point in I believe we have

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.990 
have the most point in I believe we have
around<00:01:03.480> 150<00:01:04.199> k<00:01:04.350> once<00:01:04.589> we<00:01:04.710> sell<00:01:04.920> everything<00:01:05.129> so

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
around 150 k once we sell everything so

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.670 
around 150 k once we sell everything so
you<00:01:06.060> know<00:01:06.270> we<00:01:06.750> don't<00:01:06.900> have<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.170> most<00:01:07.290> coins<00:01:07.470> we

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
you know we don't have the most coins we

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.600 
you know we don't have the most coins we
don't<00:01:07.830> really<00:01:07.950> want<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.159> be<00:01:08.220> searching<00:01:08.580> for

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
don't really want to be searching for

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.190 
don't really want to be searching for
the<00:01:08.760> higher<00:01:08.939> informs<00:01:09.479> because<00:01:09.840> if<00:01:09.960> we<00:01:10.049> end<00:01:10.170> up

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
the higher informs because if we end up

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.080 
the higher informs because if we end up
making<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.470> loss<00:01:10.650> then<00:01:10.830> it<00:01:10.950> could<00:01:11.159> end<00:01:11.310> up<00:01:11.520> being

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
making a loss then it could end up being

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.280 
making a loss then it could end up being
quite<00:01:12.299> bad<00:01:12.570> for<00:01:12.750> us<00:01:12.780> but<00:01:12.990> either<00:01:13.080> way<00:01:13.200> you've

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
quite bad for us but either way you've

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.289 
quite bad for us but either way you've
