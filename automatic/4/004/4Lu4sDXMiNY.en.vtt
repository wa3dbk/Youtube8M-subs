00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.410 
apparently like a little bit I can't say
to<00:02:02.260> the<00:02:02.440> best<00:02:02.890> range<00:02:03.190> is<00:02:03.460> medium<00:02:03.880> range<00:02:04.120> to<00:02:04.300> use

this weapon I I say any range is getting

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:08.790 
this weapon I I say any range is getting
super<00:02:07.630> far<00:02:07.960> because<00:02:08.080> it<00:02:08.229> isn't<00:02:08.410> shoot<00:02:08.560> that

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
super far because it isn't shoot that

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
it's all that's you and for the last one

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.330 
it's all that's you and for the last one
I<00:02:45.790> suggest<00:02:46.390> either<00:02:46.630> light<00:02:47.080> armor<00:02:47.560> just<00:02:48.280> to

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
I suggest either light armor just to

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.250 
I suggest either light armor just to
give<00:02:48.489> you<00:02:48.550> that<00:02:48.640> little<00:02:48.850> chance<00:02:49.480> of<00:02:49.630> surviving

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
give you that little chance of surviving

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.850 
give you that little chance of surviving
and<00:02:50.560> wanting<00:02:50.950> to<00:02:50.980> go<00:02:51.130> and<00:02:51.250> fight<00:02:51.430> or<00:02:51.810> I<00:02:52.860> think

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
and wanting to go and fight or I think

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.970 
and wanting to go and fight or I think
it's<00:02:53.980> not<00:02:54.730> like<00:02:54.910> I<00:02:55.720> think<00:02:56.440> the<00:02:56.530> first<00:02:56.739> one<00:02:56.860> is

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
it's not like I think the first one is

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.580 
it's not like I think the first one is
explosive<00:02:57.459> I<00:02:57.820> forgot<00:02:58.180> what<00:02:58.330> it<00:02:58.420> was<00:02:58.450> but<00:02:59.290> just

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
explosive I forgot what it was but just

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.530 
explosive I forgot what it was but just
two<00:02:59.739> of<00:02:59.860> them<00:03:00.070> and<00:03:00.820> you<00:03:00.940> can<00:03:01.060> also<00:03:01.180> use<00:03:01.269> it<00:03:01.480> for

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
two of them and you can also use it for

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:02.850 
two of them and you can also use it for
that<00:03:01.630> I<00:03:01.720> think<00:03:01.900> the<00:03:01.959> second<00:03:02.260> one<00:03:02.290> I<00:03:02.560> think<00:03:02.769> the

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
that I think the second one I think the

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.130 
that I think the second one I think the
last<00:03:03.130> ones<00:03:03.340> focus<00:03:03.760> you<00:03:04.450> can<00:03:04.510> use<00:03:04.660> the<00:03:04.810> focus

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
last ones focus you can use the focus

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.140 
last ones focus you can use the focus
for<00:03:05.260> the<00:03:05.380> last<00:03:05.560> one<00:03:05.799> to<00:03:06.010> give<00:03:06.940> it<00:03:07.030> that<00:03:07.060> little

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
for the last one to give it that little

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.539 
for the last one to give it that little
start<00:03:07.930> a<00:03:07.959> great<00:03:08.230> increase<00:03:08.709> but<00:03:08.980> does<00:03:09.190> do<00:03:09.430> it

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
start a great increase but does do it

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:11.550 
start a great increase but does do it
and<00:03:09.730> if<00:03:10.060> you<00:03:10.150> also<00:03:10.299> have<00:03:10.540> the<00:03:10.720> primary<00:03:11.380> one

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
and if you also have the primary one

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.710 
and if you also have the primary one
then<00:03:12.190> your<00:03:12.310> thing<00:03:12.549> will<00:03:12.730> definitely<00:03:13.540> like

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
then your thing will definitely like

automatic<00:03:17.230> I<00:03:17.950> think<00:03:18.190> I<00:03:18.220> forgot<00:03:18.370> to<00:03:18.519> mention

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
automatic I think I forgot to mention

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:20.729 
automatic I think I forgot to mention
that<00:03:18.790> and<00:03:19.360> it's<00:03:19.600> kind<00:03:19.810> of<00:03:19.840> pulley<00:03:20.260> automatic

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
that and it's kind of pulley automatic

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:22.920 
that and it's kind of pulley automatic
which<00:03:20.890> means<00:03:21.130> you<00:03:21.730> hold<00:03:21.970> a<00:03:22.060> trigger<00:03:22.299> it<00:03:22.540> shoots

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
which means you hold a trigger it shoots

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.350 
which means you hold a trigger it shoots
but<00:03:23.739> i<00:03:23.920> recommend<00:03:24.220> you<00:03:24.370> just<00:03:24.549> one<00:03:24.760> because<00:03:25.239> it

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
but i recommend you just one because it

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.840 
but i recommend you just one because it
is<00:03:25.480> on<00:03:25.630> my<00:03:25.830> semi-automatic<00:03:26.830> that<00:03:27.160> I<00:03:27.459> don't

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
is on my semi-automatic that I don't

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:29.940 
is on my semi-automatic that I don't
know<00:03:27.910> white<00:03:28.060> people<00:03:28.390> so<00:03:28.450> don't<00:03:28.600> say<00:03:28.780> that<00:03:28.959> um

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
know white people so don't say that um

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.539 
know white people so don't say that um
it's<00:03:30.459> gone<00:03:30.640> is<00:03:30.880> semi-automatic<00:03:31.420> which<00:03:32.019> means

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
it's gone is semi-automatic which means

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.979 
it's gone is semi-automatic which means
if<00:03:33.549> you<00:03:33.760> shoot<00:03:34.030> if<00:03:34.450> you<00:03:34.570> press<00:03:34.870> the<00:03:34.959> trigger

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
if you shoot if you press the trigger

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:38.250 
if you shoot if you press the trigger
you<00:03:35.410> shoot<00:03:35.680> and<00:03:35.890> I<00:03:36.610> suggest<00:03:37.360> you<00:03:37.600> tap<00:03:38.110> the

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
you shoot and I suggest you tap the

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.780 
you shoot and I suggest you tap the
trigger<00:03:38.470> because<00:03:38.650> tapping<00:03:39.489> the<00:03:39.579> trigger

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
trigger because tapping the trigger

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.130 
trigger because tapping the trigger
actually<00:03:40.150> shoots<00:03:40.450> them<00:03:40.600> out<00:03:40.690> faster<00:03:41.110> than

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
actually shoots them out faster than

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:45.300 
actually shoots them out faster than
holding<00:03:41.620> the<00:03:41.739> button<00:03:42.000> so<00:03:43.620> yeah<00:03:44.620> that's<00:03:44.829> my<00:03:44.980> kid

stick to a wall take one clip the Chris
for<00:05:36.140> power<00:05:37.140> cells<00:05:37.440> in<00:05:37.560> one<00:05:37.680> clip<00:05:37.919> you're<00:05:38.490> a<00:05:38.520> lot

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:38.669 
for power cells in one clip you're a lot

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:44.090 
for power cells in one clip you're a lot
of<00:05:38.790> maximum<00:05:39.150> 30<00:05:40.340> do<00:05:41.340> the<00:05:41.460> calculations<00:05:43.070> so<00:05:44.070> I

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:44.100
