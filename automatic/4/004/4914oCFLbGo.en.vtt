00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
way any any faction I always play at

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.920 
way any any faction I always play at
least<00:03:50.290> I<00:03:50.440> have<00:03:50.560> one<00:03:50.590> warrior<00:03:51.070> I'm<00:03:51.640> uh<00:03:51.930> it's

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
least I have one warrior I'm uh it's

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.390 
least I have one warrior I'm uh it's
tough<00:03:53.110> because<00:03:53.320> I'm<00:03:53.560> very<00:03:53.710> partial<00:03:54.070> to<00:03:54.250> the

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
tough because I'm very partial to the

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.800 
tough because I'm very partial to the
Horde<00:03:54.640> because<00:03:55.000> they<00:03:55.120> have<00:03:55.210> orcs<00:03:55.600> and

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
Horde because they have orcs and

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.630 
Horde because they have orcs and
torrents<00:03:56.200> and<00:03:56.410> then<00:03:56.920> I<00:03:57.010> love<00:03:57.160> the<00:03:57.250> Alliance

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
torrents and then I love the Alliance

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.870 
torrents and then I love the Alliance
because<00:03:57.760> they<00:03:57.970> have<00:03:58.060> dwarves<00:03:58.630> it's<00:03:59.530> hard<00:03:59.740> to

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
because they have dwarves it's hard to

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.480 
because they have dwarves it's hard to
hard<00:04:00.880> to<00:04:01.030> choose<00:04:01.300> so<00:04:01.900> I<00:04:02.560> think<00:04:02.890> I<00:04:03.160> would<00:04:03.310> roll

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:03.490 
hard to choose so I think I would roll

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:06.510 
hard to choose so I think I would roll
probably<00:04:04.000> horde<00:04:04.270> most<00:04:04.920> but<00:04:05.920> I<00:04:05.950> do<00:04:06.040> have<00:04:06.280> my

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:06.520 
probably horde most but I do have my

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.280 
probably horde most but I do have my
