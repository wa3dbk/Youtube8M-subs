it's<00:00:02.129> a<00:00:02.310> small<00:00:02.760> brown<00:00:03.240> paper<00:00:03.629> bag<00:00:04.020> I'm<00:00:04.470> looking

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
it's a small brown paper bag I'm looking

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:06.880 
it's a small brown paper bag I'm looking
at<00:00:05.130> it<00:00:05.250> right<00:00:05.279> now

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:06.890 
at it right now

notice<00:01:19.020> you're<00:01:19.140> using<00:01:19.290> titanium<00:01:19.920> did<00:01:20.369> you

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
notice you're using titanium did you

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.010 
notice you're using titanium did you
