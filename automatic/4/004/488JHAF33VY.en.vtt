there's just my least favorite out of
the<00:01:39.329> four<00:01:39.569> probably<00:01:40.380> because<00:01:40.679> it<00:01:40.799> seems<00:01:41.039> too

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:41.219 
the four probably because it seems too

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:43.459 
the four probably because it seems too
simple<00:01:41.249> to<00:01:41.759> make<00:01:41.939> but<00:01:42.179> overall<00:01:43.109> it's<00:01:43.380> a<00:01:43.439> great

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:43.469 
simple to make but overall it's a great

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:45.440 
simple to make but overall it's a great
