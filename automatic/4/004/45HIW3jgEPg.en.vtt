biotechnology advances which make the

biotechnology advances which make the
corn<00:02:27.970> that<00:02:28.090> we<00:02:28.210> grow<00:02:28.620> better<00:02:29.620> and<00:02:29.920> we<00:02:30.130> can<00:02:30.250> get

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
corn that we grow better and we can get

more ethanol out of it and the
cellulosic<00:02:32.440> ethanol<00:02:32.710> is<00:02:33.160> also<00:02:33.520> a<00:02:33.550> new<00:02:33.730> thing

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
cellulosic ethanol is also a new thing

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.940 
cellulosic ethanol is also a new thing
that<00:02:34.420> we<00:02:34.510> can<00:02:34.660> use<00:02:34.780> even<00:02:34.960> just<00:02:35.350> leaves<00:02:35.620> and

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
that we can use even just leaves and

switchgrass

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.880

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
to get ethanol out of so they're with

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.580 
to get ethanol out of so they're with
the<00:02:39.130> new<00:02:39.250> technology<00:02:39.850> there's<00:02:40.230> no<00:02:41.230> end

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
the new technology there's no end

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.500 
the new technology there's no end
beyond<00:02:42.160> the<00:02:42.340> topic<00:02:42.790> itself<00:02:43.120> what<00:02:43.420> is

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
beyond the topic itself what is

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.300 
beyond the topic itself what is
something<00:02:43.750> that<00:02:43.960> you<00:02:44.170> learned<00:02:44.740> in<00:02:45.130> this

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
something that you learned in this

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.830 
something that you learned in this
experience<00:02:45.790> that<00:02:46.150> you'll<00:02:46.300> take<00:02:46.480> with<00:02:46.660> you

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
experience that you'll take with you

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.650 
experience that you'll take with you
getting<00:02:47.800> a<00:02:47.920> group<00:02:48.130> together<00:02:48.730> it<00:02:49.390> seemed

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
getting a group together it seemed

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:50.940 
getting a group together it seemed
really<00:02:49.780> good<00:02:49.960> at<00:02:50.080> first<00:02:50.260> but<00:02:50.470> sometimes<00:02:50.830> you

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
really good at first but sometimes you

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.800 
really good at first but sometimes you
can<00:02:51.070> have<00:02:51.160> your<00:02:51.340> group<00:02:51.430> problems<00:02:51.850> and<00:02:52.120> I<00:02:52.780> guess

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
can have your group problems and I guess

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.570 
can have your group problems and I guess
learning<00:02:53.410> from<00:02:53.560> that<00:02:53.710> and<00:02:53.980> like<00:02:54.100> learning<00:02:54.430> to

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
learning from that and like learning to

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:55.410 
learning from that and like learning to
work<00:02:54.670> with<00:02:54.820> other<00:02:54.940> people<00:02:55.210> in<00:02:55.270> their

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
work with other people in their

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:56.910 
work with other people in their
differences<00:02:55.840> I'll<00:02:56.200> definitely<00:02:56.650> take<00:02:56.740> that

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
differences I'll definitely take that

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.740 
differences I'll definitely take that
with<00:02:57.040> me<00:02:57.070> and<00:02:57.340> learn<00:02:57.460> from<00:02:57.720> the<00:02:58.720> experience

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
with me and learn from the experience

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.920 
with me and learn from the experience
I've<00:02:59.200> had<00:02:59.230> now<00:02:59.470> the<00:02:59.710> senior<00:03:00.220> X<00:03:00.370> proves<00:03:01.300> to

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
I've had now the senior X proves to

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:03.840 
I've had now the senior X proves to
oneself<00:03:02.350> that<00:03:02.560> you<00:03:02.740> have<00:03:03.100> accomplished

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
oneself that you have accomplished

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.820 
oneself that you have accomplished
something<00:03:04.060> you<00:03:04.750> have<00:03:05.110> the<00:03:05.290> skills<00:03:05.620> that

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
something you have the skills that

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.920 
something you have the skills that
you're<00:03:06.220> supposed<00:03:06.460> to<00:03:06.520> have<00:03:06.670> learned<00:03:06.850> for<00:03:07.660> high

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
you're supposed to have learned for high

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.900 
you're supposed to have learned for high
school<00:03:08.230> I'm<00:03:08.770> thinking<00:03:09.100> if<00:03:09.190> I<00:03:09.280> did<00:03:09.730> through

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
school I'm thinking if I did through

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.090 
school I'm thinking if I did through
courses<00:03:10.209> and<00:03:10.600> just<00:03:10.989> aced<00:03:11.260> the<00:03:11.470> test<00:03:11.500> I<00:03:11.950> would

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
courses and just aced the test I would

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.280 
courses and just aced the test I would
be<00:03:12.190> like<00:03:12.370> yay<00:03:12.910> I<00:03:13.239> know<00:03:13.360> this<00:03:13.660> knowledge<00:03:14.050> but

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
be like yay I know this knowledge but

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.260 
be like yay I know this knowledge but
what<00:03:14.560> am<00:03:14.680> I<00:03:14.739> gonna<00:03:14.860> do<00:03:15.010> with<00:03:15.160> it<00:03:15.190> but<00:03:15.489> with<00:03:16.150> the

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
what am I gonna do with it but with the

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.360 
what am I gonna do with it but with the
senior<00:03:16.570> X<00:03:16.720> they're<00:03:16.989> like<00:03:17.110> Hera<00:03:17.650> I<00:03:17.830> know<00:03:17.950> this

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
senior X they're like Hera I know this

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.190 
senior X they're like Hera I know this
knowledge<00:03:18.550> and<00:03:19.030> this<00:03:19.600> is<00:03:19.690> what<00:03:19.810> I<00:03:19.840> could<00:03:20.080> do

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
knowledge and this is what I could do

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:20.699 
knowledge and this is what I could do
with<00:03:20.350> it

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
with it

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.710 
with it
and<00:03:20.800> I<00:03:21.610> think<00:03:21.820> it's<00:03:21.940> a<00:03:21.970> lot<00:03:22.060> of<00:03:22.090> personal

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:22.720 
and I think it's a lot of personal

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.229 
and I think it's a lot of personal
satisfaction<00:03:22.930> in<00:03:23.470> it<00:03:23.670> more<00:03:24.670> often<00:03:25.000> than<00:03:25.209> not

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
satisfaction in it more often than not

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:28.380 
satisfaction in it more often than not
they<00:03:26.230> walk<00:03:26.440> away<00:03:26.739> from<00:03:26.920> here<00:03:27.160> thinking<00:03:27.760> they

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
they walk away from here thinking they

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.440 
they walk away from here thinking they
are<00:03:28.630> so<00:03:28.980> powerful<00:03:29.980> to<00:03:30.220> do<00:03:30.370> such<00:03:30.640> significant

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
are so powerful to do such significant

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.690 
are so powerful to do such significant
work<00:03:31.750> and<00:03:32.050> I<00:03:32.410> think<00:03:32.680> that<00:03:32.920> kind<00:03:33.130> of<00:03:33.250> confidence

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
work and I think that kind of confidence

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.759 
work and I think that kind of confidence
that<00:03:33.940> you're<00:03:34.180> putting<00:03:34.360> in<00:03:34.570> kids<00:03:34.780> and<00:03:35.110> that

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
that you're putting in kids and that

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:37.560 
that you're putting in kids and that
kind<00:03:36.040> of<00:03:36.160> responsibility<00:03:36.790> that<00:03:37.209> you're

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
kind of responsibility that you're

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.080 
kind of responsibility that you're
giving<00:03:37.900> to<00:03:38.019> them<00:03:38.200> to<00:03:38.470> say<00:03:38.680> you're<00:03:38.980> worth<00:03:39.220> doing

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
giving to them to say you're worth doing

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.790 
giving to them to say you're worth doing
something<00:03:40.660> hard<00:03:41.170> and<00:03:41.580> something<00:03:42.580> big<00:03:43.480> is<00:03:44.110> so

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
something hard and something big is so

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.890 
something hard and something big is so
important<00:03:45.640> to<00:03:45.820> give<00:03:45.970> them<00:03:46.269> because<00:03:46.480> it's<00:03:46.810> a

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
important to give them because it's a

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.970 
important to give them because it's a
gift<00:03:48.300> it<00:03:49.300> allows<00:03:49.720> them<00:03:49.959> to<00:03:50.110> realize<00:03:50.470> where

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
gift it allows them to realize where

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.540 
gift it allows them to realize where
they<00:03:51.130> can<00:03:51.310> go

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.550 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.610 

you
