00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
well just go a little bit outside of

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.820

find when you're lining your upper lip a
lot<00:02:41.260> of<00:02:41.290> people<00:02:41.410> tend<00:02:41.830> to<00:02:41.890> fill<00:02:42.100> in<00:02:42.220> the

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
lot of people tend to fill in the

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.340 
lot of people tend to fill in the
Cupid's<00:02:42.700> bow<00:02:42.880> which<00:02:43.360> is<00:02:43.510> this<00:02:43.660> party<00:02:43.960> here<00:02:44.140> and

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
Cupid's bow which is this party here and

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:47.130 
Cupid's bow which is this party here and
then<00:02:44.890> go<00:02:44.920> down<00:02:45.460> but<00:02:46.420> when<00:02:46.600> you<00:02:46.720> go<00:02:46.870> down<00:02:47.110> you

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
then go down but when you go down you

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.500 
then go down but when you go down you
don't<00:02:47.500> actually<00:02:47.880> you<00:02:48.880> kind<00:02:49.090> of<00:02:49.180> create<00:02:49.420> a

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
don't actually you kind of create a

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.210 
don't actually you kind of create a
smaller<00:02:49.870> line<00:02:50.200> whereas<00:02:50.560> if<00:02:50.680> you<00:02:50.800> go<00:02:50.950> from<00:02:51.100> the

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
smaller line whereas if you go from the

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:57.630 
smaller line whereas if you go from the
bottom<00:02:51.520> up<00:02:51.700> it's<00:02:52.090> more<00:02:52.390> rounded<00:02:56.100> whoops<00:02:57.100> if

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
bottom up it's more rounded whoops if

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.340 
bottom up it's more rounded whoops if
you<00:02:57.790> go<00:02:57.940> from<00:02:58.060> the<00:02:58.210> bottom<00:02:58.510> up<00:02:58.630> it's<00:02:58.840> more<00:02:59.080> of<00:02:59.230> a

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
you go from the bottom up it's more of a

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.500 
you go from the bottom up it's more of a
rounded<00:02:59.800> shape<00:03:00.400> so<00:03:00.700> it<00:03:00.730> tends<00:03:01.000> to<00:03:01.120> work<00:03:01.300> a<00:03:01.390> lot

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
rounded shape so it tends to work a lot

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:14.840 
rounded shape so it tends to work a lot
better<00:03:01.630> so<00:03:02.050> you<00:03:02.080> know

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:33.309 

so<00:03:15.420> you<00:03:15.510> can<00:03:15.660> see<00:03:15.810> those<00:03:15.960> quite<00:03:16.440> for<00:03:16.740> energy

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:33.319 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:34.929 

and<00:03:33.890> once<00:03:34.099> you've<00:03:34.249> done<00:03:34.400> that<00:03:34.459> we're<00:03:34.730> going<00:03:34.879> to

00:03:34.929 --> 00:03:34.939 
and once you've done that we're going to

and once you've done that we're going to
do<00:03:35.060> the<00:03:35.180> same<00:03:35.209> thing<00:03:35.629> is<00:03:35.749> what<00:03:35.870> you<00:03:35.930> did<00:03:36.079> on

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
do the same thing is what you did on

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.839 
do the same thing is what you did on
your<00:03:36.200> bottom<00:03:36.439> lip<00:03:36.680> and<00:03:36.890> just<00:03:37.489> fill<00:03:37.670> in<00:03:37.790> the

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:37.849

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:40.739 
your bottom lip and just fill in the
corners<00:03:38.329> and<00:03:38.569> kind<00:03:39.530> of<00:03:39.590> make<00:03:39.799> the<00:03:39.980> center<00:03:40.370> more

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:40.749 
corners and kind of make the center more

00:03:40.749 --> 00:03:42.879 
corners and kind of make the center more
kind<00:03:41.749> of<00:03:41.810> prominence<00:03:42.200> and<00:03:42.379> make<00:03:42.590> it<00:03:42.739> look

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:42.889 
kind of prominence and make it look

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:50.979 
kind of prominence and make it look
fuller<00:03:44.049> so<00:03:45.049> just<00:03:45.260> do<00:03:45.349> the<00:03:45.469> same<00:03:45.650> again<00:03:49.870> and<00:03:50.870> you

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
fuller so just do the same again and you

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:52.300 
fuller so just do the same again and you
don't<00:03:51.170> need<00:03:51.290> to<00:03:51.439> be<00:03:51.560> neat<00:03:51.769> with<00:03:51.799> this<00:03:52.099> little

go<00:06:30.000> for<00:06:30.030> both<00:06:30.360> because<00:06:30.600> goes<00:06:30.810> a<00:06:30.840> bit<00:06:30.990> crazy<00:06:31.290> and

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:32.190 
go for both because goes a bit crazy and

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:34.790
