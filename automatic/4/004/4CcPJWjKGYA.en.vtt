00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.900
 ah 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:25.970
 today I'm going to visit to shuffle is a 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:28.189
 well-known stylist by god has won the 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.110
 guinness award for the biggest bow 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.960
 of the story a bow of a meter and 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.460
 medium high and also for their wigs 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.700
 because he's one of the few people who 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:40.060
 is dedicated exclusively to making wigs 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.060
 in Lima 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:51.270
 the possible natural objective 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.820
 what we seek is what 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.059
 we are specialized is in 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.220
 serve the client about measures that 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.800
 Normally we do not have wigs 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:04.500
 of showcase to sell it come buy it 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.940
 take away we do not know us first 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.830
 we have to see the characteristics that 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.869
 the client wants the process is 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.619
 obviously as I imagined a lot 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:16.920
 The client arrives and the client is 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.869
 take the measurements and specifically to 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.910
 what does the wig want to use it all 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.710
 day for special occasions me 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.380
 commented as well as secret video that there 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.420
 many women in long relationships that 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.180
 that's why they do not want to surprise 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.920
 the couple looking for a wig for iu 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.740
 blonde or redhead something totally 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.140
 different and out of the usual 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.490
 I found kostas quite fun or 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.510
 there's also what I want to use good 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.330
 as part of your day to day 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.250
 radical up to clear is what happens with 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.460
 the people who wear their wig 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:51.280
 occasion the place is clear that they use it 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:54.610
 only for two or three four 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.840
 occasions a year when they think they have 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.640
 three four or five commitments 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.070
 important that stretch look different 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.720
 look and there where it seizes instants 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.550
 environmental crimes that change anything 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.800
 since the ros seems to me very hilarious 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:09.180
 average terror that I fall for 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.180
 be half in tdt 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.230
 to make the technology technology has 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.590
 advanced a lot and suddenly though 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.900
 yes happened but now there are some clips 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.700
 special there are some combs that 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.370
 they grab with the natural hair of the 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.740
 person in the case for example we have 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.330
 the case of alopecia that is impossible 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.520
 where to hold on to a hair in the 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.240
 hair but there are some glues 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.240
 special 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.160
 there are two alternatives if you are going through or 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.660
 you know you're going to go through a 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.450
 chemotherapy 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:50.810
 you can go before it starts to fall 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.100
 hair and already send them to wig 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.600
 so that when this whole process happens 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.370
 is perhaps less shocking 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.590
 so if you can use the same hair 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.720
 they can cut you before or you can wait 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.490
 to which she dares to decide at the moment 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.310
 It provokes you make a wig on 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.020
 moment to do it do not knit first the 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.330
 hair 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:10.490
 normally this hair is left in the 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.830
 hairdresser people who sell it 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:17.030
 Let the hair grow depends on your 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:19.280
 hair and we process them before 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.160
 to sanitization then comes the 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.950
 sterilization then comes a small 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:28.100
 Hydroxide layer to be able to remove 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:32.140
 some impure cuticle immediately 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.140
 then we start making the fabric 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:39.710
 when the complete strip is already made 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:43.120
 normally the full strip will arrive 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:43.120
 to this extreme 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:51.160
 1 We never want to look and be the best 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.900
 natural it is possible to envision a little 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.599
 contradictory with a subject like wig 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.099
 but you know what can be done by looking 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:58.870
 some good materials putting cloth 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:01.030
 well has good specialists the 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.860
 effect can be a natural and something so 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.780
 small that actually for example 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.910
 you're going through a cancer is what 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.640
 least you're worried about hair but 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.379
 It seems silly however if it goes 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.209
 to be good to look in the mirror to feel 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:14.890
 pretty they talk to you 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:19.769
 some way is going to have a 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:19.769
 positive consequence on how you feel
