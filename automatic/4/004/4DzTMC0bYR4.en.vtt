00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.540
 [Music] 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:20.090
 [Music] 

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:22.490
 if I use the os devices so systems of 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.840
 apple inserts are often through 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.400
 a lock code protected 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.740
 that is, if i have this iphone and 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.840
 then lose that ipad he has found 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.210
 first of all no possibility and mine 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:36.170
 get confidential data such as 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:39.320
 photos e-mails sms appointment entries or 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.820
 similar to the lockout but only protects 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.589
 very inadequate so i am in the 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.089
 did in the situation without much effort 

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:45.230
 to crack this loco and I want that 

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:47.150
 demonstrate here 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.430
 First, I switch the ipad 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.860
 so just expressing a long here 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.850
 switch off button confirm that here now 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.460
 it is off 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.820
 the ipad is connected via a whole 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.409
 normal usb cable with my laptop me 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.960
 will now lead an attack by that 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:04.670
 It allows me this look comes very much 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.590
 quickly find out and access 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.450
 to get all the data I have that 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.580
 already prepared it is very 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.140
 Efficient is important for me that 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.360
 I always click the right buttons 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.650
 so press is needed 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.299
 If you have two buttons in the right one 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:22.689
 order and the right duration 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:28.850
 press on it so I click on next 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:30.530
 123 123 is counted here and 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.799
 So I see how long I can see 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.119
 the buttons must be pressed now must 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:37.640
 I release the top button 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.869
 the lower still for a total of 13 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.780
 hold down seconds 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:45.289
 What happens now is the following 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:48.020
 a book level exploit is executed 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:48.920
 on the ipad that allows me the ipad 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.859
 strange to boot 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.350
 that means that on this ipad 

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:56.689
 but normal ios is not being dug 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.179
 what you're on it on the 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:01.069
 ios but what i get from mine 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:03.679
 Let laptop offer here 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:05.600
 we see very nice the ipad offers and 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:07.999
 we just do not have the normal one 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.310
 apple here in front but a pineapple 

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:11.240
 that means the attacks succeed me 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.319
 actually have the possibility 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:17.120
 start my own ios here and 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.680
 then we see indeed also in so 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.420
 we have the opportunity to look 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.330
 actually notice that we are here 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.950
 a typical linux screen in front of us 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.530
 So have 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.120
 just these typical ads the linux 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.819
 is very much like the attack was 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.340
 So far so successful that I now 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.470
 I'm gentleman in my own house 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.269
 here actually access to the root 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.099
 that proves also in the me 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:42.260
 start here 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:44.030
 there stands me to the side then we start 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.840
 the partie and make a ssh 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.849
 connection to the ios device and are 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.620
 I'm here now 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:53.540
 So really administrator on the 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.080
 I'm a gentleman in my own house I show 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.340
 that time 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:00.560
 I give it a typical unix command 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.940
 and she also what we reveal here 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.340
 on the ipad on it have 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.470
 I am good I am the administrator 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.150
 but the data is on the ipad 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.470
 are encrypted by default 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.140
 means so easily I can 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.750
 do not see pictures and the like 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.610
 But I can try a password 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.560
 rate attack and start 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.680
 that is why the blood fund of the blood fund 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.540
 tried all sorts of pins from up 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.840
 afterwards the correct pin on the 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:30.730
 screen stands and sets mechanisms 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:33.190
 Try out the repetitive spin 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.720
 prohibit forbidding 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.000
 Here you can see very nice rattling here 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:41.299
 so the pins through now we are at 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.519
 the 20 at the 30 and so on 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:45.920
 means the search space is possible pins 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:49.910
 in full by eye at the latest 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.620
 if here is the pin 99 99 we must 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:55.040
 have found the right pin the 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.780
 we found the right lockout 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.780
 also see that a bit more 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:03.709
 now a hit means that 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:05.959
 the correct lockout is 01 28 now 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:07.160
 have made it to the system too 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:09.290
 to get a grip we can now with 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.579
 This entices the thing to elicit and 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.920
 have a full access to it 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:13.639
 what can we do about it 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.250
 such attacks 

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:19.519
 we have the opportunity to try 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:21.739
 always use a new ios device 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:24.260
 in addition, no publicly known 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.570
 jailbreak is available on the internet 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.470
 this is a very shirt-sleeved 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.380
 because I do not know 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.950
 For example, if there is similar book level 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:36.380
 exploits for this iphone 4s 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.350
 possibly have industry spies 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.410
 news 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:42.090
 something like that already programmed or 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:45.000
 bought somewhere on the black market 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:49.080
 So not a good solution to the application of 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.420
 Devices like in the case of the iphone or 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:54.720
 the ipad needs to be aware that one 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:56.190
 loss of the device to the thief 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.230
 possibility gives on the data 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.420
 So access that is I suggest 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:01.710
 no sensitive data 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:05.930
 mobile terminals 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.930
 especially to save this here
