things that it really helps promote a
skin<00:01:49.020> detoxification<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:50.520> key<00:01:50.790> is<00:01:51.119> you've

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
skin detoxification the key is you've

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.160 
skin detoxification the key is you've
got<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:51.990> do<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.170> sauna<00:01:52.470> for<00:01:52.590> a<00:01:53.460> slow<00:01:54.450> cook<00:01:54.869> and

got to do a sauna for a slow cook and

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.709 
got to do a sauna for a slow cook and
that<00:01:55.740> means<00:01:55.950> not<00:01:56.369> above<00:01:56.640> 140<00:01:57.240> degrees

the sod is by the way also help with

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.220 
the sod is by the way also help with
weight<00:02:28.660> loss<00:02:28.720> because<00:02:29.620> it's<00:02:29.800> like<00:02:30.010> a<00:02:30.040> slow

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
weight loss because it's like a slow

weight loss because it's like a slow
thermogenic<00:02:32.230> process<00:02:33.000> mm-hmm<00:02:34.000> it<00:02:34.300> takes<00:02:34.690> for

thermogenic process mm-hmm it takes for

to<00:02:37.810> enjoy<00:02:37.960> and<00:02:38.470> promote<00:02:39.100> because<00:02:39.550> you<00:02:39.790> can

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
to enjoy and promote because you can

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.240 
to enjoy and promote because you can
more<00:02:40.210> readily<00:02:40.390> control<00:02:41.050> the<00:02:41.170> temperature<00:02:41.470> it

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
more readily control the temperature it

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.550 
more readily control the temperature it
takes<00:02:42.580> about<00:02:42.820> 15<00:02:43.300> minutes<00:02:43.330> from<00:02:43.780> room
