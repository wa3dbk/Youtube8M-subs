 effectively and originally used 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:20.310
 space in the aircraft don cordon is 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.780
 cube with a side of 3 meters 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.270
 compact and efficient house 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.840
 resembles a swiss knife all the furniture and 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.500

 what is the unity with nature 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:06.350
 the house seems more than it is divided 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.950
 into three sectors on one side of the kitchen 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:15.530
 shower and toilet from another dining room and study 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:17.630

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.280
 instead you grab open the window and itâ€™s as if 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.200
 relaxing in nature 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.909

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:15.220
 already accustomed to the future of micro houses they 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:20.530
 very compact build carried on

 reduces the risk of future home faults 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.239
 assembled from ready-made modules 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:35.019
 this reduces the time 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:35.620
 construction doubled in construction will 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:37.900
 to prevail 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:41.609
