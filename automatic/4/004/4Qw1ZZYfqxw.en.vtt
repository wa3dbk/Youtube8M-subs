00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
capabilities of this amp what I'm doing

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.740 
capabilities of this amp what I'm doing
right<00:01:05.979> now<00:01:06.039> is<00:01:06.490> I'm<00:01:06.880> running<00:01:07.000> my<00:01:07.240> ovation

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:07.750 
right now is I'm running my ovation

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:09.600 
right now is I'm running my ovation
double-neck<00:01:08.289> through<00:01:08.619> it<00:01:08.740> and<00:01:08.920> then<00:01:09.280> sending

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
double-neck through it and then sending

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.270 
double-neck through it and then sending
two<00:01:09.909> passive<00:01:10.600> signals<00:01:10.869> that<00:01:11.289> are<00:01:11.409> routed<00:01:11.860> away

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
two passive signals that are routed away

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.669 
two passive signals that are routed away
from<00:01:12.789> the<00:01:13.119> internal<00:01:13.630> preamp<00:01:14.080> it's<00:01:14.289> sort<00:01:14.500> of<00:01:14.560> my

00:01:14.669 --> 00:01:14.679 
from the internal preamp it's sort of my

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:16.859 
from the internal preamp it's sort of my
own<00:01:14.860> design<00:01:15.220> so<00:01:15.490> you<00:01:15.550> get<00:01:15.729> one<00:01:16.000> passive<00:01:16.479> signal

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 
own design so you get one passive signal

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:20.010 
own design so you get one passive signal
per<00:01:17.409> neck<00:01:17.679> and<00:01:17.950> I'm<00:01:18.369> setting<00:01:18.700> those<00:01:18.970> two<00:01:19.840> to

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
per neck and I'm setting those two to

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.389 
per neck and I'm setting those two to
separate<00:01:21.569> active<00:01:22.569> di<00:01:22.869> boxes<00:01:23.649> sitting<00:01:24.009> on<00:01:24.130> top

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:24.399 
separate active di boxes sitting on top

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:26.130 
separate active di boxes sitting on top
of<00:01:24.610> the<00:01:24.729> amp<00:01:24.909> and<00:01:25.149> then<00:01:25.270> I'm<00:01:25.390> sending<00:01:25.569> each<00:01:25.840> DI

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
of the amp and then I'm sending each DI

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.070 
of the amp and then I'm sending each DI
box<00:01:26.500> to<00:01:27.159> one<00:01:27.909> of<00:01:28.000> the<00:01:28.119> two<00:01:28.270> channels<00:01:28.780> on<00:01:28.960> the

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
box to one of the two channels on the

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.590 
box to one of the two channels on the
amp<00:01:29.289> and<00:01:29.560> so<00:01:30.399> you've<00:01:30.520> got<00:01:30.670> two<00:01:30.880> channels<00:01:31.330> here

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
amp and so you've got two channels here

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.240 
amp and so you've got two channels here
it's<00:01:31.750> basically<00:01:31.899> like<00:01:32.319> having<00:01:32.649> two<00:01:32.830> amps<00:01:33.130> in

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
it's basically like having two amps in

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.800 
it's basically like having two amps in
one<00:01:33.429> because<00:01:33.580> you<00:01:33.729> have<00:01:33.850> everything<00:01:34.360> just

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
one because you have everything just

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:36.389 
one because you have everything just
totally<00:01:35.380> separate<00:01:35.800> on<00:01:35.979> the<00:01:36.009> two<00:01:36.280> different

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:36.399 
totally separate on the two different

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:39.029 
totally separate on the two different
channels<00:01:36.789> and<00:01:37.409> what<00:01:38.409> I'm<00:01:38.500> doing<00:01:38.799> is<00:01:38.920> I'm

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:39.039 
channels and what I'm doing is I'm

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:40.590 
channels and what I'm doing is I'm
panning<00:01:39.399> one<00:01:39.549> channel<00:01:39.940> all<00:01:40.149> the<00:01:40.270> way<00:01:40.360> to<00:01:40.420> the

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
panning one channel all the way to the

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.270 
panning one channel all the way to the
right<00:01:40.810> one<00:01:41.350> channel<00:01:41.679> all<00:01:41.799> the<00:01:41.920> way<00:01:42.009> to<00:01:42.069> the

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
right one channel all the way to the

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.100 
right one channel all the way to the
left<00:01:42.489> so<00:01:42.729> it<00:01:42.819> lets<00:01:42.970> me<00:01:43.119> play<00:01:43.300> totally<00:01:43.929> in

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
left so it lets me play totally in

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.040 
left so it lets me play totally in
