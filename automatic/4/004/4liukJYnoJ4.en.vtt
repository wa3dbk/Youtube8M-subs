00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:20.259
 In from eh jig not I'm wonder if standard type of this compact silhouette 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.920
 It's just a little longer, semi long type 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.670
 This 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.670
 There you two 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.890
 Buber It is you or I wonder Nero spider 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.300
 I am 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:55.960
 Medium Type This would be what I feel or rather door comparatively high 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.960
 Hit heavily 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:18.290
 here to cope with a large big game 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:23.560
 In the next N assist hook 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:25.080
 There's no rear hook, so I swear that I 'm wearing something so this day 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:30.700
 Sound of hook 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:35.920
 This say twin so come eat from the side of his head has been on the type of four-stroke 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:38.799
 The real hook is also equipped with a standard book so that any fish can aim at it already. 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:44.900
 In the front , this is 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:48.320
 It is a specification called single hook with silver Maa-this one is better 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:51.500
 Well I think Well kana First of all easy-to-use for the people of dinner 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:54.870
 To as the proper use 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.939
 It is during 2314 here 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:01.609
 There are 20 small people 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:04.880
 There are a and 30g 40g 

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:10.030
 Of in from roughly ne er breakwater 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:13.870
 I think that about 30g will be the top for Shore Jigging 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:18.010
 Depending on the speed of sound of white, you need 40g. 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.850
 If the wind is strong , there are cases where it can not be taken unless it is 40 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.800
 I will 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.800
 In reverse 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:41.790
 Small time to say boo 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:44.610
 of one of the I mean multi-San' of the above in the Tteyuu here 20g 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.770
 I think it is a technique 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:52.460
 Bounce towards the Medium 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:52.460
 There are three 60 and 45 in 45 but this is still 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:03:00.750
 First Yappa It requires 60g was doubled to explore the place it is promoting deep 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:04.770
 I think it's okay with 40g which was shallow 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:09.720
 Therefore, the speed of the week but it is another land consumption of speed is after 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:15.860
 I If you do not take the bottom on the assumption Tteyuu sure I bottom can be taken 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:19.370
 a Within the range that you can get the beginning first because it changes and there are many roots 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:24.260
 I think it would be nice if you grab a grab 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:28.790
 Well , take it there firmly in a little more than 10 parts and turn it into something slightly lighter 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:34.730
 To use those light in the state it is not possible to think Hey Soko and is better to think in the wind Tteyuu 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:35.840
 Write to continue , so it 's inefficient, so it 's better to take some of them inside 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:40.040
 Do you think 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:44.120
 Make sure to use this semi long and standard 8 properly 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:50.180
 I think it would be nice if you could use it 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:51.000
 In color of deployment There are also seven colors of now but I is also added because soon see you new color 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.630
 Also 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:59.760
 It has become a very hey basic 7 colors 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:05.440
 Like even pink Toka ne blue Toka such a classic're collapse today after all Well 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:08.160
 Although it is relatively strong, I was able to catch the influence though 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:08.160
 Figure tail guy 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:34.000
 Buber an gen 4 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:39.320
 Management and Well that natural system and the unusual and the red-ish for if there about three colors 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:44.690
 The Well of you think that it can respond to various situations 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:45.020
 While using this Semi-Lon U and Standard while using head color rotation 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.500
 Hmm 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:52.660
 It all means I think that hope you enjoy it super taste 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.660
 Please base big of Ttsu from their own 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:59.520
 Big color 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:02.160
 Standard dress those of Stendhal though there Milon events Te is 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.340
 Koiwa 's short cake shuttle 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.700
 I'm good at interpretation 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:10.290
 I will correspond to these works 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:10.290
 It is a common one pitch 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:19.460
 Once I not want to Tsu Shakti safety will also support 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:23.180
 It is standard that we cope with all hiccups 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:26.240
 Because the seed rape of that kind is compact, the flight distance comes out 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:28.569
 That is also the merit of the standard 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:33.309
 Well that either 

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:34.270
 If you say that you want to get started first, let me introduce you to the standard hall 

00:05:33.309 --> 00:05:37.920
 If you get used to it 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:44.169
 I think if you also use the semi-long people 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:49.790
 Because it corresponds to various situations when there are those two, it is used properly 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:54.409
 Phantom So attack the lock I want aim the thing Oh in Well standard that the aim is various fish 

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:59.080
 I think it would be nice to use it like that 

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:59.080
 Become originally be rewarded by taking 1 lonely 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:10.009
 Because I had no choice, I exceeded the fish 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:13.760
 It is semi-long of a jig para that we are using now 

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:17.900
 Knitting to think that the people of Medium say I Which one 

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:21.080
 Comparatively high from I feel, such as special zones in vegetables 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:25.030
 It's a short pitch scoop and it's better than this 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.030
 It feels like you are flying 15 

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:37.460
 Line skip as much as possible 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:39.910
 You will get an action that you should talk about in a swinging manner . 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:43.090
 The splash Medium 

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:49.289
 I often fly but after 

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:52.210
 It's not like I'm not kidding, I feel like I'll let you do this kind of retrieve british 

00:06:49.289 --> 00:06:56.650
 You will get that action too 

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:58.950
 Let's go really Wow 

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:01.449
 You can still catch this 

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:03.740
 His Gane 

00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:07.289
 4 I will pull 

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:09.420
 When there are you in the surface of science 

00:07:07.289 --> 00:07:13.370
 More money c or a 

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:14.860
 It is good when there are various fish in Nagoya 

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:16.520
 Semi long 

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:17.720
 Just pulling on the surface 

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:22.880
 This 

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:24.480
 If you try to attack unexpectedly, you can get the right fish 

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:27.650
 And press guests 

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.650
 It says so Ritoriru 

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:35.310
 Or Damn 

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:35.310
 Basically basically 

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:41.550
 It feels like a middle mob in the broom taking priming 

00:07:47.169 --> 00:07:54.150
 I intend it each Medium specialty Gaaro 

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:57.510
 It is also the neighborhood myself because the movement is different 

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:59.710
 Than there is one by one feature 

00:07:57.510 --> 00:08:01.400
 Feature well 

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:06.430
 Don't use it 

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:06.430
 I think if you use it more effectively
