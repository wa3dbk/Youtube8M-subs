ported<00:00:13.230> enclosures<00:00:13.710> are<00:00:13.889> more<00:00:14.070> useful<00:00:14.490> for

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
ported enclosures are more useful for

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.670 
ported enclosures are more useful for
music<00:00:15.150> because<00:00:15.870> you're<00:00:16.049> not<00:00:16.139> going<00:00:16.320> to<00:00:16.470> have

enclosure sounds more musical it
actually<00:00:28.380> uses<00:00:29.070> more<00:00:29.490> of<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.939> available<00:00:30.179> xmax

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
actually uses more of the available xmax

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.220 
actually uses more of the available xmax
of<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.140> speaker<00:00:32.360> in<00:00:33.360> relation<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.020> box

of the speaker in relation to the box

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.869 
of the speaker in relation to the box
let<00:00:34.739> me<00:00:34.860> edit<00:00:35.070> that<00:00:35.370> part<00:00:37.129> using<00:00:38.129> a<00:00:38.219> vented<00:00:38.610> box

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
let me edit that part using a vented box

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.549 
let me edit that part using a vented box
makes<00:00:39.239> more<00:00:39.480> efficient<00:00:39.870> use<00:00:39.989> of<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.200> speaker

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
makes more efficient use of the speaker

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.260 
makes more efficient use of the speaker
because<00:00:40.710> you're<00:00:41.070> actually<00:00:41.280> using<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.030> box

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
because you're actually using the box

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.700 
because you're actually using the box
itself<00:00:42.719> as<00:00:43.020> an<00:00:43.829> assist<00:00:44.660> so<00:00:45.660> going<00:00:45.989> back<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.559> our

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
itself as an assist so going back to our

itself as an assist so going back to our
type<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:47.430> enclosure<00:00:47.760> we<00:00:48.000> change<00:00:48.239> it<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.480> vented

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
type of enclosure we change it to vented

type of enclosure we change it to vented
it<00:00:49.739> suggests<00:00:49.980> and<00:00:50.870> personally<00:00:51.870> I<00:00:52.140> choose

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
it suggests and personally I choose

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.830 
it suggests and personally I choose
extended<00:00:53.670> bass<00:00:53.850> however<00:00:54.329> you<00:00:54.510> have<00:00:54.629> high

fidelity<00:00:58.350> for<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.640> flattest<00:01:00.030> possible

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
fidelity for the flattest possible

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.900 
fidelity for the flattest possible
response<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:01.079> extended<00:01:01.980> bass<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.640> hit<00:01:02.789> the

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
response and extended bass to hit the

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.039 
response and extended bass to hit the
lowest<00:01:03.120> possible<00:01:03.449> notes

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
lowest possible notes

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.410 
lowest possible notes
I<00:01:04.199> choose<00:01:04.830> extended<00:01:05.309> bass<00:01:05.489> I<00:01:05.729> find<00:01:06.090> this<00:01:06.270> to

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
I choose extended bass I find this to

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.219 
I choose extended bass I find this to
sound<00:01:06.630> best<00:01:06.990> with<00:01:07.170> this<00:01:07.260> particular<00:01:07.560> driver

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
sound best with this particular driver

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.740 
sound best with this particular driver
now<00:01:10.229> what<00:01:10.409> we're<00:01:10.590> seeing<00:01:10.619> here<00:01:11.600> is<00:01:12.600> an

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
now what we're seeing here is an

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.160 
now what we're seeing here is an
enclosure<00:01:13.110> internal<00:01:13.619> volume<00:01:13.799> of<00:01:14.479> 11.66<00:01:15.479> cubic

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
enclosure internal volume of 11.66 cubic

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.560 
enclosure internal volume of 11.66 cubic
feet<00:01:16.380> which<00:01:17.130> is<00:01:17.310> pretty<00:01:17.490> unusable<00:01:18.060> in<00:01:18.240> most

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
feet which is pretty unusable in most

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.870 
feet which is pretty unusable in most
modern<00:01:18.840> homes<00:01:19.320> so<00:01:19.950> change<00:01:20.250> this<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.670> something

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
modern homes so change this to something

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.350 
modern homes so change this to something
that's<00:01:21.090> going<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.390> be<00:01:21.509> usable<00:01:21.750> for<00:01:22.020> you

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
that's going to be usable for you

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.850 
that's going to be usable for you
personally<00:01:24.360> what<00:01:24.720> I<00:01:24.780> say<00:01:25.049> is<00:01:25.170> don't<00:01:25.380> go<00:01:25.560> below

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
personally what I say is don't go below

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.090 
personally what I say is don't go below
half<00:01:26.159> of<00:01:26.369> this<00:01:26.869> so<00:01:27.869> we'll<00:01:28.320> model<00:01:28.680> six<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.070> a

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
half of this so we'll model six and a

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.670 
half of this so we'll model six and a
half<00:01:29.130> cubic<00:01:29.490> feet<00:01:30.049> actually<00:01:31.049> you<00:01:31.380> know<00:01:31.470> what

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
half cubic feet actually you know what

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.230 
half cubic feet actually you know what
let's<00:01:31.890> take<00:01:31.979> that<00:01:32.250> down<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.729> five<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.210> half

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
let's take that down to five and a half

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.190 
let's take that down to five and a half
cubic<00:01:33.479> feet<00:01:34.189> that's<00:01:35.189> actually<00:01:35.610> have<00:01:36.079> hit<00:01:37.079> your

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
cubic feet that's actually have hit your

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.109 
cubic feet that's actually have hit your
suggest<00:01:37.680> FB<00:01:38.189> because<00:01:38.579> that's<00:01:38.759> going<00:01:39.000> to

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
suggest FB because that's going to

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.300 
suggest FB because that's going to
change<00:01:39.329> with<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.780> volume<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.290> that's<00:01:41.009> going

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
change with the volume and that's going

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.950 
change with the volume and that's going
to<00:01:41.400> be<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.640> suggested<00:01:42.150> tuning<00:01:42.420> frequency<00:01:42.570> of

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
to be the suggested tuning frequency of

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.819 
to be the suggested tuning frequency of
the<00:01:43.020> box<00:01:44.450> the<00:01:45.450> damping<00:01:45.869> has<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.290> same<00:01:46.470> effect

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
the box the damping has the same effect

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.609 
the box the damping has the same effect
here<00:01:47.119> so<00:01:48.119> we're<00:01:48.270> really<00:01:48.720> not<00:01:48.960> going<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.170> worry

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
here so we're really not going to worry

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.440 
here so we're really not going to worry
about<00:01:49.680> that<00:01:49.950> so<00:01:50.189> much<00:01:50.310> with<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:50.880> vented<00:01:51.270> box

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
about that so much with a vented box

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.139 
about that so much with a vented box
because<00:01:51.810> we<00:01:51.960> want<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.470> make<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.770> box<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.790> be<00:01:53.939> as

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
because we want to make the box to be as

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.050 
because we want to make the box to be as
close<00:01:54.450> to<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.750> model<00:01:55.140> as<00:01:55.320> possible<00:01:56.060> the

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
close to the model as possible the

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.469 
close to the model as possible the
damping<00:01:57.750> material<00:01:58.229> will<00:01:58.740> affect<00:01:59.100> that<00:01:59.390> so<00:02:00.390> we

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
damping material will affect that so we

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.639 
damping material will affect that so we
go<00:02:00.630> back

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649 
go back

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:05.200 
go back
we're<00:02:03.649> looking<00:02:03.890> at<00:02:04.009> tuning<00:02:04.250> frequency<00:02:04.429> of<00:02:04.789> 21

this<00:02:08.149> is<00:02:08.300> going<00:02:08.479> to<00:02:08.539> be<00:02:08.690> what<00:02:08.840> determines<00:02:08.959> your

this is going to be what determines your

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739 
were displacing

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.130 
were displacing
the<00:02:13.580> minimum<00:02:13.910> then<00:02:14.209> size<00:02:14.540> in<00:02:14.780> terms<00:02:14.989> of

the minimum then size in terms of

the minimum then size in terms of
diameter<00:02:15.590> is<00:02:15.680> going<00:02:15.860> to<00:02:15.950> be<00:02:16.010> quite<00:02:16.220> large<00:02:16.810> in

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
diameter is going to be quite large in

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.360 
diameter is going to be quite large in
this<00:02:17.959> case<00:02:18.140> it's<00:02:18.349> eight<00:02:18.500> point<00:02:18.769> three<00:02:18.830> inches

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
this case it's eight point three inches

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.610 
this case it's eight point three inches
this<00:02:20.239> is<00:02:20.420> going<00:02:20.629> to<00:02:20.720> be<00:02:20.840> much<00:02:21.019> larger<00:02:21.470> than

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
this is going to be much larger than

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:22.750 
this is going to be much larger than
anything<00:02:21.920> that's<00:02:22.160> available<00:02:22.370> on<00:02:22.640> the<00:02:22.700> market

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
anything that's available on the market

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.509 
anything that's available on the market
so<00:02:23.690> instead<00:02:23.959> of<00:02:24.019> using<00:02:24.260> one<00:02:24.560> large<00:02:24.830> port<00:02:25.190> we're

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
so instead of using one large port we're

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:30.160 
so instead of using one large port we're
going<00:02:25.700> to<00:02:25.790> use<00:02:25.910> two<00:02:26.239> smaller<00:02:26.599> ports<00:02:29.019> I'm<00:02:30.019> going

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
going to use two smaller ports I'm going

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.320 
going to use two smaller ports I'm going
to<00:02:30.260> change<00:02:30.470> this<00:02:30.680> through<00:02:30.860> about<00:02:31.160> four<00:02:32.060> inches

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
to change this through about four inches

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.440 
to change this through about four inches
in<00:02:32.569> diameter

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.940

notice<00:02:35.450> also<00:02:35.780> when<00:02:35.959> we<00:02:36.049> change<00:02:36.290> the<00:02:36.500> port

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
notice also when we change the port

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.890 
notice also when we change the port
diameter<00:02:37.549> we're<00:02:37.760> also<00:02:38.060> affecting<00:02:38.569> the<00:02:38.599> cord

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900

basically a lot smaller the port

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.449 
basically a lot smaller the port
