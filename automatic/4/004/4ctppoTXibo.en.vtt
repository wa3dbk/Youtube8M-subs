00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
now it's pretty basic there's not really

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.600 
now it's pretty basic there's not really
not<00:00:56.420> much<00:00:56.570> to<00:00:56.630> it<00:00:56.920> and<00:00:57.920> you're<00:00:58.040> gonna<00:00:58.160> see<00:00:58.400> just

not much to it and you're gonna see just

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.100 
not much to it and you're gonna see just
how<00:00:58.730> easy<00:00:58.760> it<00:00:59.059> was<00:00:59.650> so<00:01:00.650> I<00:01:01.150> got<00:01:02.150> some<00:01:02.360> scx10

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
how easy it was so I got some scx10

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.140 
how easy it was so I got some scx10
parts<00:01:04.510> and<00:01:05.510> a<00:01:05.570> piece<00:01:05.750> of<00:01:05.780> PVC<00:01:06.080> I<00:01:06.850> had<00:01:07.850> a<00:01:07.880> little

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
parts and a piece of PVC I had a little

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.850 
parts and a piece of PVC I had a little
metal<00:01:08.420> bar<00:01:08.630> for<00:01:08.900> some<00:01:09.050> weight<00:01:11.860> plastic

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
metal bar for some weight plastic

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.930 
metal bar for some weight plastic
conduit<00:01:13.220> everywhere<00:01:13.729> a<00:01:14.649> little<00:01:15.940> aluminum

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 
conduit everywhere a little aluminum

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.320 
conduit everywhere a little aluminum
cutting<00:01:17.390> blade<00:01:17.720> at<00:01:17.930> the<00:01:17.960> bottom<00:01:18.940> and<00:01:19.940> some

cutting blade at the bottom and some
decorative<00:01:21.170> pieces<00:01:22.540> so<00:01:24.009> first<00:01:25.009> things<00:01:25.250> first

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.210 

here's<00:01:30.200> the<00:01:30.470> method<00:01:30.649> to<00:01:30.950> my<00:01:31.100> madness<00:01:33.160> this<00:01:34.160> is

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
here's the method to my madness this is

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.690 
here's the method to my madness this is
the<00:01:34.550> extended<00:01:35.180> body<00:01:35.360> post<00:01:35.630> for<00:01:35.810> the<00:01:35.899> scx10<00:01:36.700> and

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
the extended body post for the scx10 and

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.200 
the extended body post for the scx10 and
these<00:01:37.910> are<00:01:38.149> the<00:01:38.420> old<00:01:38.600> links<00:01:39.789> we<00:01:40.789> all<00:01:40.970> have

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
these are the old links we all have

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.359 
these are the old links we all have
these<00:01:41.479> because<00:01:42.170> we're<00:01:42.440> all<00:01:42.530> anal<00:01:42.800> and<00:01:43.100> we<00:01:43.190> took

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
these because we're all anal and we took

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.180 
these because we're all anal and we took
off<00:01:43.930> we<00:01:44.930> took<00:01:45.080> them<00:01:45.259> off<00:01:45.380> and<00:01:45.530> put<00:01:45.680> on<00:01:45.710> aluminum

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
off we took them off and put on aluminum

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.260 
off we took them off and put on aluminum
links<00:01:46.460> so<00:01:47.119> we<00:01:47.360> should<00:01:47.510> all<00:01:47.600> have<00:01:47.780> these<00:01:47.900> parts

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
links so we should all have these parts

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.670 
links so we should all have these parts
kick<00:01:50.270> it<00:01:50.390> around<00:01:50.510> but<00:01:50.900> anyways<00:01:51.229> you<00:01:51.380> see<00:01:51.560> what

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
kick it around but anyways you see what

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.219 
kick it around but anyways you see what
I<00:01:51.710> did<00:01:51.979> I<00:01:52.189> had<00:01:52.790> some<00:01:53.090> zip<00:01:53.270> ties<00:01:53.479> in<00:01:53.689> there<00:01:54.700> and

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
I did I had some zip ties in there and

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:59.050 
I did I had some zip ties in there and
some<00:01:57.229> tape<00:01:57.470> and<00:01:57.770> that's<00:01:58.430> how<00:01:58.549> I<00:01:58.580> got<00:01:58.850> to

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
some tape and that's how I got to

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.840 
some tape and that's how I got to
wearing<00:01:59.390> it<00:02:00.040> so<00:02:01.040> there's<00:02:01.220> the<00:02:01.340> parts<00:02:01.610> treat

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
wearing it so there's the parts treat

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:20.850 
wearing it so there's the parts treat
these<00:02:02.479> thing<00:02:02.720> arms<00:02:02.960> coming<00:02:03.170> in

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.910 

so<00:02:21.270> this<00:02:22.270> is<00:02:22.420> the<00:02:22.540> mount<00:02:22.780> I<00:02:22.990> came<00:02:23.200> up<00:02:23.350> with<00:02:23.560> to

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
so this is the mount I came up with to

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.730 
so this is the mount I came up with to
go<00:02:24.070> on<00:02:24.280> to<00:02:24.520> the<00:02:24.790> frame<00:02:25.090> of<00:02:25.120> the<00:02:25.420> scx10<00:02:25.960> so

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
go on to the frame of the scx10 so

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.830 
go on to the frame of the scx10 so
basically<00:02:27.640> just<00:02:27.760> a<00:02:28.210> little<00:02:28.660> piece<00:02:28.810> of

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
basically just a little piece of

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.710 
basically just a little piece of
aluminum<00:02:29.080> I<00:02:29.640> attach<00:02:30.640> it<00:02:30.670> to<00:02:30.910> the<00:02:31.000> frame<00:02:31.240> here<00:02:31.540> I

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
aluminum I attach it to the frame here I

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.580 
aluminum I attach it to the frame here I
have<00:02:32.680> another<00:02:32.800> hole<00:02:33.610> going<00:02:34.330> to<00:02:34.720> a<00:02:34.960> rod<00:02:35.320> that

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
have another hole going to a rod that

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.230 
have another hole going to a rod that
goes<00:02:35.620> across<00:02:35.860> the<00:02:36.040> other<00:02:36.280> side<00:02:36.430> and<00:02:36.790> that<00:02:36.940> had

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
goes across the other side and that had

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:43.190 
goes across the other side and that had
support<00:02:37.690> as<00:02:37.780> well<00:02:37.960> so<00:02:38.890> moving<00:02:39.850> this<00:02:39.970> over

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:50.130 

here's<00:02:44.200> the<00:02:44.290> other<00:02:44.500> side<00:02:45.390> underside<00:02:49.140> so

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
here's the other side underside so

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:57.600 
here's the other side underside so
that's<00:02:50.950> pretty<00:02:51.160> strong<00:02:51.430> I<00:02:55.050> can<00:02:56.430> look<00:02:57.430> at<00:02:57.550> the

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
that's pretty strong I can look at the

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:06.949 
that's pretty strong I can look at the
truck<00:02:57.820> with<00:02:57.970> it<00:02:59.400> so<00:03:02.220> this<00:03:03.220> bar<00:03:03.490> here<00:03:04.740> comes<00:03:05.740> out

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
truck with it so this bar here comes out

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:10.530 
truck with it so this bar here comes out
the<00:03:07.959> plow<00:03:08.200> goes<00:03:08.830> on<00:03:09.010> it's<00:03:10.000> just<00:03:10.180> there<00:03:10.360> for

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
the plow goes on it's just there for

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.990 
the plow goes on it's just there for
support<00:03:10.690> for<00:03:11.050> now<00:03:11.170> and<00:03:11.920> the<00:03:12.550> bigger<00:03:12.760> one

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
support for now and the bigger one

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000 
support for now and the bigger one
underneath<00:03:13.390> in<00:03:13.660> the<00:03:13.750> plastic<00:03:14.140> conduit<00:03:17.010> that's

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
underneath in the plastic conduit that's

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.890 
underneath in the plastic conduit that's
actually<00:03:18.310> just<00:03:18.430> a<00:03:18.610> big<00:03:18.760> piece<00:03:18.940> of<00:03:18.970> window<00:03:19.209> with

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
actually just a big piece of window with

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.800 
actually just a big piece of window with
plastic<00:03:20.350> conduit<00:03:20.650> on<00:03:20.860> it<00:03:21.040> and<00:03:21.450> it's<00:03:22.450> use<00:03:22.630> that

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
plastic conduit on it and it's use that

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:30.630 
plastic conduit on it and it's use that
support<00:03:26.640> so<00:03:27.640> I<00:03:28.709> said<00:03:29.709> I<00:03:29.739> got<00:03:29.920> a<00:03:29.950> steel<00:03:30.190> bar<00:03:30.430> here

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
support so I said I got a steel bar here

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.580 
support so I said I got a steel bar here
to<00:03:30.790> have<00:03:30.940> weight<00:03:31.150> so<00:03:31.420> when<00:03:31.600> the<00:03:31.750> winch<00:03:31.959> lifts

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
to have weight so when the winch lifts

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.820 
to have weight so when the winch lifts
it<00:03:32.680> up<00:03:32.800> it<00:03:33.430> wants<00:03:33.640> to<00:03:33.880> sit<00:03:34.060> down<00:03:34.470> and<00:03:35.470> it<00:03:35.680> makes

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
it up it wants to sit down and it makes

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.350 
it up it wants to sit down and it makes
it<00:03:35.950> want<00:03:36.100> to<00:03:36.220> dig<00:03:36.820> into<00:03:37.000> the<00:03:37.180> ground<00:03:39.209> those<00:03:40.209> are

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
it want to dig into the ground those are
