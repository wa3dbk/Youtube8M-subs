00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.520
 Franz Beckenbauer we start with the positive 15 minutes after the final whistle 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.790
 Hermes quarterfinal achieved that congratulations but to the game 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.429
 but you have to say it was one of the weakest of these 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.509
 World Cup to watch 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:16.850
 yes sure is logical - not liked but you have the circumstances 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:20.550
 The Moroccans are a team that never s4 backwards 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.130
 World games that we knew 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.840
 this is a decided counter team or we colors him 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.410
 we have to have jumped the number 9 to have the number 10 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.260
 We knew here percent pretty meager covered the Moroccans do not come 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.430
 in the game what's left for them to end up on deck who will be chosen 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.970
 plays 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.930
 and then more luck that it could be a nice game forwards 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.630
 There we did not know because we knew that too 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.460
 we will get few chances to score percent will of course wanted 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.550
 Researchers are the ones that offer us the maximum we can make of it 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.620
 again it was not our big weakness that will be the again 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.630
 could not exploit existing chances and we had to Rome 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.980
 just before the two of the three minutes to go words of the BDM shot ahead 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.640
 that a wealth of small fouls with the first and second half and 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.020
 thereby many free kicks 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.270
 since one would not have had to make German crew more out of it than 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.860
 most important thing was prepared after we have percent that was my opinion 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.170
 we have a lot of free kicks 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.980
 by the hard attacks of the Moroccans the percentages but no friendship am 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.210
 let the Piccolos inconsistently intervene 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.680
 and that is how many come to us 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.010
 Offered standard situations and there we have done too little 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.820
 from that 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.200
 Percent he thinks we can not have practiced Steinert situations 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.370
 Lies but I just have to come out more is what follows is that 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:37.050
 it's right 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.340
 I said earlier the defense was really good 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.910
 but the harmonious interaction between midfield and attack was 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:44.810
 Missed too much Budde 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.540
 it also important to percent 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.560
 the movement today was not as harmonious as in the more than 3000 because 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.370
 in the three played previously from Londrina to the Moroccans who knew 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.050
 the pace had been taken out of the game deliberately slow and deliberate 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.249
 Percent the players cut their strength rather the opponent 

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:06.079
 to wage surcharges alone and then to beat them with their counterparts 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:08.260
 as they did against the Portuguese 

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.330
 we were warned they did not even shoot our goal dangerously 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.240
 sinking, the north has voted 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.410
 l per cent, we certainly do not have to play better against the 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.989
 To insist Mexicans 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.790
 Percent what about Rudi Völler was substituted for a break 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.419
 the Tenno Schenkenzell 

00:02:22.419 --> 00:02:26.159
 Claus Rollinger has two huge chances in this game can not use mistakes 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:27.209
 you first time 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.310
 neatly said he just has to push his choice despite the awesome reflex too 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.119
 the goalkeeper, they are satisfied with their captain 

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:35.889
 But I am that I am very satisfied 

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:38.290
 that over 90 minutes can play percent 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.700
 he had had two months in the game break, his last serious game 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.980
 Over 90 minutes I have LEG percent two months back in many great 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.630
 Games practice but today he has proven he saw Murray not the old one 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.359
 as we know him but he comes back in slowly 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:54.290
 What I noticed that Franz Beckenbauer 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.310
 in an orchestra he masters his instrument but here was one too 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.950
 Lists at the factory when I catch credit Bosque differently they all can get together 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.449
 but sometimes you have the feeling that everyone is playing for themselves 

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:07.909
 very well of course it is right against such a defense you have to percent into 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:11.860
 Risk must go to percent We have deliberately provoked the structure 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.880
 we knew a duel request to give because before come to fat mistake for the 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.220
 ask others and come to success from standard situations 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.300
 we knew that 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.300
 whether the tar made or at Mader can be very hard to crack and I have 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.060
 yes actually missed standard situations much more 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.500
 promised both were made aware that one provokes the opponent that one 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.510
 in the duel in that one that one is the fault is it will be 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.740
 of which we are prepared but we have to see from the standard situations 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:41.040
 The Mexicans have seen welcome opponents quarterfinal game 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.040
 So maybe they can both come 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:47.859
 Will they move now that Monterrey or if they continue to live outside 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:51.019
 Form balls fly right back to the game after the game 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:53.849
 you still devices Durban we will arrive again that we will afterwards 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:55.840
 decide today too a dead morning early 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.370
 Group that he stays one day before we arrive there and have that 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:00.809
 we feel our grudge 

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:03.439
 although of course it goes against Mexico then probably the 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:04.729
 Ruhlaer are over 

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:08.150
 but my God we have to play against Mexico the Mexicans are too 

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:11.949
 the favorites Circles of this World Cup they have the impressive also against Bulgaria 

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:16.079
 underlined but you have to beat them first time and i think we can 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.949
 put us quite well on the Mexican woman 

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:21.389
 Thank you Franz Böhmer has supported the Unia team 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:25.110
 that they will increase in the footballing field and full today 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.529
 for the quarterfinals bank chief 

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:32.649
 Fans of the Emperor calmly and calmly but sweaty acted as savior 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.539
 And if he did, I think he still could 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:39.449
 if he had trained and maybe sometimes he is 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:43.280
 Entertain the statute when he looks from the outside to the inside who knows 

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:48.090
 What Jala footballer he has been and that maybe he is 

00:04:48.089 --> 00:04:52.550
 God has stopped everything a bit too early 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.259
 winning one to zero is also won 

00:04:55.259 --> 00:05:00.370
 our reporters in Monterey were their controllers and there was and Wilfred 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.770
 Luchtenberg percent morning early there is breakfast star 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:11.169
 and from 9 to 10 o'clock you can do the whole teaching game again 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:12.230
 look at 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:13.210
 if they feel like it 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.539
 Please apologize for the second-series slip of the tongue 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:18.839
 MSS 2 o'clock 8 

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:21.220
 with us it is 18 o'clock 12 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.590
 but it was an exciting and hectic day I wish you good 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.800
 Night and I give back to Baden-Baden goodbye
