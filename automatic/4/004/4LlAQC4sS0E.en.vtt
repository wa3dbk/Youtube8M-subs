00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.030 

this<00:00:00.299> is<00:00:00.539> what<00:00:00.870> I<00:00:00.900> call<00:00:01.140> Lana's<00:00:01.589> way<00:00:01.740> of

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
this is what I call Lana's way of

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.770 
this is what I call Lana's way of
setting<00:00:02.460> gathering<00:00:02.939> stitches<00:00:03.330> I<00:00:03.449> worked<00:00:03.629> it

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
setting gathering stitches I worked it

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.269 
setting gathering stitches I worked it
out<00:00:03.870> when<00:00:04.110> my<00:00:04.230> daughter<00:00:04.440> was<00:00:04.710> really<00:00:04.890> small

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
out when my daughter was really small

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:06.980 
out when my daughter was really small
and<00:00:05.490> I<00:00:05.549> was<00:00:05.580> doing<00:00:05.910> lots<00:00:06.180> of<00:00:06.390> ruffles<00:00:06.750> and<00:00:06.899> I

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
and I was doing lots of ruffles and I

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.330 
and I was doing lots of ruffles and I
thought<00:00:07.170> there's<00:00:07.379> got<00:00:07.620> to<00:00:07.740> be<00:00:07.770> an<00:00:07.950> easier<00:00:08.280> way

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
thought there's got to be an easier way

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.600 
thought there's got to be an easier way
so<00:00:09.269> on<00:00:09.599> this<00:00:09.750> machine<00:00:09.990> right<00:00:10.889> here<00:00:10.950> is<00:00:12.230> 5/8

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:13.610 
so on this machine right here is 5/8

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.090 
so on this machine right here is 5/8
what<00:00:14.610> I<00:00:14.639> do<00:00:14.759> since<00:00:15.269> my<00:00:15.389> eye<00:00:15.480> is<00:00:15.690> always<00:00:16.170> used<00:00:16.619> to

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
what I do since my eye is always used to

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.519 
what I do since my eye is always used to
having<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.699> edge<00:00:17.850> run<00:00:18.300> right<00:00:18.570> along<00:00:18.690> here<00:00:19.350> I

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
having the edge run right along here I

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.490 
having the edge run right along here I
go<00:00:20.160> ahead<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:20.520> set<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.850> fabric<00:00:21.270> there<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:21.900> I

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
go ahead and set the fabric there and I

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.080 
go ahead and set the fabric there and I
would<00:00:22.650> have<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.890> fabric<00:00:23.100> wrong<00:00:23.490> side<00:00:23.850> up<00:00:24.060> so

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
would have the fabric wrong side up so

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.640 
would have the fabric wrong side up so
pretend<00:00:24.510> this<00:00:24.570> is<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.779> wrong<00:00:25.080> side<00:00:25.439> of<00:00:25.560> the

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
pretend this is the wrong side of the

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.189 
pretend this is the wrong side of the
fabric<00:00:25.970> then<00:00:26.970> I<00:00:27.000> make<00:00:27.420> use<00:00:27.599> of<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.869> fact<00:00:28.050> that

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
fabric then I make use of the fact that

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.870 
fabric then I make use of the fact that
I<00:00:28.289> have<00:00:28.500> needle<00:00:28.890> position<00:00:29.369> on<00:00:29.490> my<00:00:29.640> sewing

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
I have needle position on my sewing

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.450 
I have needle position on my sewing
machine<00:00:30.330> so<00:00:30.630> on<00:00:30.779> this<00:00:31.050> machine<00:00:31.340> what<00:00:32.340> I'm

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
machine so on this machine what I'm

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.360 
machine so on this machine what I'm
going<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:32.759> do<00:00:33.030> is<00:00:33.329> move<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.870> needle<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.380> couple

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
going to do is move the needle a couple

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.500 
going to do is move the needle a couple
of<00:00:35.460> notches<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.270> right<00:00:37.040> so<00:00:38.040> now<00:00:38.969> at

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
of notches to the right so now at

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.569 
of notches to the right so now at
regular<00:00:40.079> stitch<00:00:40.320> length<00:00:40.649> I'm<00:00:40.860> going<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.460> go

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
regular stitch length I'm going to go

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.450 
regular stitch length I'm going to go
forward<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.440> backward<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.530> little<00:00:43.559> bit<00:00:43.920> so<00:00:44.430> now

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
forward and backward a little bit so now

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.819 
forward and backward a little bit so now
those<00:00:44.910> stitches<00:00:45.149> are<00:00:45.450> secured<00:00:45.960> then<00:00:46.680> I'm

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
those stitches are secured then I'm

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.299 
those stitches are secured then I'm
going<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.010> go<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.489> longer<00:00:47.940> stitch<00:00:48.210> length

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
going to go to the longer stitch length

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:51.889 
going to go to the longer stitch length
but<00:00:50.309> you<00:00:50.340> don't<00:00:50.640> want<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.030> go<00:00:51.149> real<00:00:51.570> long

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
but you don't want to go real long

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.779 
but you don't want to go real long
because<00:00:52.469> real<00:00:52.829> long<00:00:53.100> stitches<00:00:53.399> are<00:00:53.610> going<00:00:53.730> to

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
because real long stitches are going to

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.580 
because real long stitches are going to
make<00:00:53.940> big<00:00:54.210> bulky<00:00:54.600> gathers<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.170> I<00:00:55.230> generally

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
make big bulky gathers and I generally

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.010 
make big bulky gathers and I generally
like<00:00:55.800> finer<00:00:56.190> gathers<00:00:56.699> I<00:00:56.940> have<00:00:57.360> not<00:00:57.539> adjusted

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
like finer gathers I have not adjusted

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.110 
like finer gathers I have not adjusted
my<00:00:58.170> tension<00:00:58.620> I<00:00:58.739> leave<00:00:58.949> it<00:00:59.070> normal<00:00:59.430> so<00:00:59.789> see<00:01:00.000> I'm

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
my tension I leave it normal so see I'm

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.880 
my tension I leave it normal so see I'm
keeping<00:01:00.390> my<00:01:00.750> edge<00:01:00.989> right<00:01:01.379> at<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.590> normal

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
keeping my edge right at the normal

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.830 
keeping my edge right at the normal
place<00:01:02.129> but<00:01:02.820> I've<00:01:02.940> moved<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.359> needle<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.809> the

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
place but I've moved the needle to the

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.789 
place but I've moved the needle to the
right<00:01:05.390> so<00:01:06.390> you<00:01:06.479> go<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.750> whole<00:01:06.930> distance<00:01:07.170> of

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
right so you go the whole distance of

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.660 
right so you go the whole distance of
what<00:01:07.979> you<00:01:08.070> want<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.310> gather

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.860 

beep<00:01:14.670> nice<00:01:14.850> light<00:01:15.150> Reds<00:01:16.160> now<00:01:17.570> set<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:18.690> back

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:18.870 
beep nice light Reds now set it back

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.980 
beep nice light Reds now set it back
same<00:01:19.650> position<00:01:20.250> but<00:01:20.970> now<00:01:21.180> you're<00:01:21.480> going<00:01:21.720> to

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
same position but now you're going to

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.070 
same position but now you're going to
move<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.950> needle<00:01:23.100> here<00:01:23.790> Center<00:01:24.240> so<00:01:24.840> now<00:01:24.960> I'm

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
move the needle here Center so now I'm

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.520 
move the needle here Center so now I'm
going<00:01:25.260> to<00:01:25.320> move<00:01:25.440> it<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:26.600> couple<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:27.660> notches<00:01:27.840> to

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
going to move it a couple of notches to

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.770 
going to move it a couple of notches to
the<00:01:28.650> left<00:01:31.220> so<00:01:32.220> yes<00:01:32.550> and<00:01:33.000> I<00:01:33.150> go<00:01:33.270> forwards<00:01:33.660> and

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
the left so yes and I go forwards and

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.140 
the left so yes and I go forwards and
backwards<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.440> then<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.610> longer<00:01:35.910> stitch

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
backwards and then to the longer stitch

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.550 
backwards and then to the longer stitch
length<00:01:38.000> so<00:01:39.000> this<00:01:39.330> row<00:01:39.510> of<00:01:39.630> stitches<00:01:40.020> is<00:01:40.170> beyond

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
length so this row of stitches is beyond

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.190 
length so this row of stitches is beyond
the<00:01:40.740> 5/8<00:01:41.190> and<00:01:41.430> yes<00:01:41.640> it<00:01:41.820> would<00:01:41.940> show<00:01:42.270> when<00:01:43.080> you

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
the 5/8 and yes it would show when you

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.570 
the 5/8 and yes it would show when you
attached<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:43.860> but<00:01:44.040> I'm<00:01:44.130> going<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.340> show<00:01:44.550> you

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
attached it but I'm going to show you

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.249 
attached it but I'm going to show you
where<00:01:44.910> it'll<00:01:45.090> come<00:01:45.270> out<00:01:45.390> just<00:01:45.720> quick<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.110> easy

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
where it'll come out just quick and easy

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:52.340 
where it'll come out just quick and easy
I<00:01:50.300> always<00:01:51.300> like<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.630> set<00:01:51.840> two<00:01:52.110> rows<00:01:52.320> of

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
I always like to set two rows of

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.060 
I always like to set two rows of
gathering<00:01:52.920> stitches<00:01:53.220> when<00:01:53.550> I'm<00:01:53.670> doing<00:01:53.940> gather

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.219 

and<00:01:59.070> I<00:01:59.369> also<00:01:59.550> like<00:01:59.910> to<00:02:00.090> use<00:02:00.119> polyester<00:02:00.720> thread

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
and I also like to use polyester thread

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.810 
and I also like to use polyester thread
don't<00:02:01.530> use<00:02:01.680> cotton<00:02:01.920> thread<00:02:02.070> for<00:02:02.400> this<00:02:02.520> because

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
don't use cotton thread for this because

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.940 
don't use cotton thread for this because
it<00:02:02.940> has<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.300> have<00:02:03.420> some<00:02:03.660> strength<00:02:03.930> so<00:02:04.740> now

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
it has to have some strength so now

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.770 
it has to have some strength so now
remember<00:02:05.610> this<00:02:05.850> is<00:02:05.970> the<00:02:06.090> wrong<00:02:06.270> side<00:02:06.570> of<00:02:06.690> the

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
remember this is the wrong side of the

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.999 
remember this is the wrong side of the
fabric<00:02:06.960> I'm<00:02:07.830> pulling<00:02:08.399> up<00:02:08.660> my<00:02:09.660> top<00:02:09.929> threads<00:02:10.350> and

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
fabric I'm pulling up my top threads and

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:18.860 
fabric I'm pulling up my top threads and
I'm<00:02:11.160> pulling<00:02:11.520> them<00:02:11.670> up<00:02:11.820> together<00:02:17.360> now<00:02:18.360> because

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
I'm pulling them up together now because

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.560 
I'm pulling them up together now because
I<00:02:19.200> did<00:02:19.860> that<00:02:20.040> back<00:02:20.310> stitch<00:02:20.700> at<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.060> beginning

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
I did that back stitch at the beginning

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.400 
I did that back stitch at the beginning
I<00:02:22.459> can't<00:02:23.459> just<00:02:23.730> pull<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:24.060> threads<00:02:24.300> out<00:02:24.510> that's

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
I can't just pull the threads out that's

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.840 
I can't just pull the threads out that's
why<00:02:25.709> I<00:02:25.739> do<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:26.100> back<00:02:26.310> stitch<00:02:26.640> at<00:02:26.820> the

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
why I do the back stitch at the

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:36.110 
why I do the back stitch at the
beginning<00:02:33.860> so<00:02:34.860> then<00:02:35.100> if<00:02:35.430> I<00:02:35.670> were<00:02:35.820> going<00:02:36.000> to

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
beginning so then if I were going to

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:44.000 
beginning so then if I were going to
attach<00:02:36.540> this<00:02:36.930> to<00:02:37.200> a<00:02:37.470> piece<00:02:37.709> of<00:02:37.739> fabric<00:02:42.890> it's<00:02:43.890> a

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
attach this to a piece of fabric it's a

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
attach this to a piece of fabric it's a
nice<00:02:44.190> Halloween<00:02:44.910> color<00:02:45.330> scheme<00:02:46.670> so<00:02:47.670> let's<00:02:47.880> say

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
nice Halloween color scheme so let's say

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.699 
nice Halloween color scheme so let's say
I<00:02:48.060> were<00:02:48.209> going<00:02:48.360> to<00:02:48.420> attach<00:02:48.660> it<00:02:48.690> to<00:02:48.870> this<00:02:49.380> piece

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
I were going to attach it to this piece

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.259 
I were going to attach it to this piece
of<00:02:49.890> fabric<00:02:50.040> I<00:02:50.840> pinned<00:02:51.840> this<00:02:52.170> end<00:02:52.940> and<00:02:53.940> you

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
of fabric I pinned this end and you

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.020 
of fabric I pinned this end and you
really<00:02:54.570> just<00:02:54.870> pull<00:02:55.230> up<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.590> threads<00:02:55.950> so<00:02:56.880> that

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
really just pull up the threads so that

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.660 
really just pull up the threads so that
the<00:02:57.180> threads<00:02:57.510> match<00:02:58.220> but<00:02:59.220> other<00:02:59.400> like

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
the threads match but other like

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.940 
the threads match but other like
whatever<00:03:00.150> length<00:03:00.390> of<00:03:00.570> fabric<00:03:00.959> you're<00:03:01.590> putting

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
whatever length of fabric you're putting

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.710 
whatever length of fabric you're putting
it<00:03:02.070> to<00:03:02.250> so<00:03:02.489> let's<00:03:02.700> say<00:03:02.940> that<00:03:02.970> I<00:03:03.150> wanted<00:03:03.420> it<00:03:03.570> to

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
it to so let's say that I wanted it to

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:10.160 
it to so let's say that I wanted it to
go<00:03:03.799> to<00:03:04.799> here<00:03:06.680> put<00:03:07.680> a<00:03:07.709> pin<00:03:08.040> in<00:03:08.070> there<00:03:08.959> pull<00:03:09.959> those

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
go to here put a pin in there pull those

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:15.199 
go to here put a pin in there pull those
top<00:03:10.440> threads<00:03:11.120> until<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.299> threads<00:03:14.209> themselves

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
top threads until the threads themselves

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.440 
top threads until the threads themselves
are<00:03:15.570> equal<00:03:16.350> to<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.340> length<00:03:17.519> of<00:03:17.730> the<00:03:17.880> fabric<00:03:18.299> to

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
are equal to the length of the fabric to

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.659 
are equal to the length of the fabric to
which<00:03:18.600> you're<00:03:18.750> going<00:03:18.959> to<00:03:19.079> attach<00:03:19.380> it<00:03:19.669> then

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:20.669 
which you're going to attach it then

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:24.700 
which you're going to attach it then
take<00:03:21.090> the<00:03:21.750> threads<00:03:22.139> and<00:03:22.519> figure-eight<00:03:23.519> them

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:24.710 
take the threads and figure-eight them

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:28.970 
take the threads and figure-eight them
around<00:03:25.710> that<00:03:25.920> pin<00:03:26.840> now<00:03:27.840> what<00:03:28.560> you're<00:03:28.650> gonna<00:03:28.740> do

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
around that pin now what you're gonna do

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.600 
around that pin now what you're gonna do
is<00:03:29.160> take<00:03:29.430> your<00:03:29.580> fingernail<00:03:30.090> and<00:03:31.400> adjust<00:03:32.400> the

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:32.610 
is take your fingernail and adjust the

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:37.660 
is take your fingernail and adjust the
gathers<00:03:34.160> so<00:03:35.160> that<00:03:35.310> they're<00:03:35.460> nice<00:03:35.610> and<00:03:35.640> even

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
gathers so that they're nice and even

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.610 
gathers so that they're nice and even
then<00:03:38.670> pin<00:03:39.210> it<00:03:39.240> the<00:03:39.480> rest<00:03:39.660> of<00:03:39.840> the<00:03:39.900> way

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.570

yep an apron gathered to a band now I'm
going<00:03:56.640> to<00:03:56.700> go<00:03:56.790> back<00:03:56.970> to<00:03:57.000> regular<00:03:57.420> stitch

going to go back to regular stitch

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.530 
going to go back to regular stitch
length<00:03:58.140> Center<00:03:58.920> needle<00:03:59.070> position<00:03:59.190> and<00:03:59.820> I'm

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
length Center needle position and I'm

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.480 
length Center needle position and I'm
going<00:04:00.780> to<00:04:00.840> sew<00:04:01.170> it<00:04:01.200> on<00:04:01.470> at<00:04:02.400> the<00:04:02.610> five-eighths

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:04.490 
going to sew it on at the five-eighths

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:12.680 
going to sew it on at the five-eighths
which<00:04:05.490> would<00:04:05.730> be<00:04:05.910> right<00:04:06.690> in<00:04:06.930> the<00:04:07.050> middle<00:04:11.690> are

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
which would be right in the middle are

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.610 
which would be right in the middle are
these<00:04:12.840> two<00:04:13.020> rows<00:04:13.200> of<00:04:13.230> stitches<00:04:15.320> so<00:04:16.320> those

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
these two rows of stitches so those

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.710 
these two rows of stitches so those
gathers<00:04:17.190> should<00:04:17.519> just<00:04:17.760> stand<00:04:18.000> in<00:04:18.239> straight

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
gathers should just stand in straight

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:26.950 
gathers should just stand in straight
little<00:04:18.930> marching<00:04:19.830> type

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:36.740 

yes<00:04:27.960> I<00:04:28.200> do<00:04:28.260> so<00:04:28.650> over<00:04:28.920> things

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:40.140 

now<00:04:38.100> that<00:04:39.100> rule<00:04:39.310> of<00:04:39.430> gathering<00:04:39.880> stitches

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
now that rule of gathering stitches

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.320 
now that rule of gathering stitches
furthest<00:04:40.780> to<00:04:40.990> the<00:04:41.020> left<00:04:41.490> is<00:04:42.490> going<00:04:42.880> to<00:04:43.060> show

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
furthest to the left is going to show

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.960 
furthest to the left is going to show
but<00:04:44.230> I<00:04:44.290> want<00:04:44.500> to<00:04:44.650> pull<00:04:44.800> it<00:04:44.919> out<00:04:45.040> so<00:04:45.550> all<00:04:45.760> I<00:04:45.790> need

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
but I want to pull it out so all I need

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:53.580 
but I want to pull it out so all I need
to<00:04:46.180> do<00:04:46.480> is<00:04:47.380> clip<00:04:47.860> that<00:04:48.070> thread<00:04:52.230> there<00:04:53.230> where<00:04:53.530> it

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
to do is clip that thread there where it

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:54.379 
to do is clip that thread there where it
started

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:54.389 
started

00:04:54.389 --> 00:05:07.050 
started
then<00:04:55.389> get<00:04:55.630> hold<00:04:55.870> of<00:04:55.990> it<00:04:56.790> here<00:04:57.790> at<00:04:57.880> the<00:04:58.030> end<00:05:06.060> you

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.060 
then get hold of it here at the end you

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.520 
then get hold of it here at the end you
can<00:05:07.180> go<00:05:07.360> ahead<00:05:07.450> and<00:05:07.660> pull<00:05:07.870> it<00:05:07.960> all<00:05:08.110> the<00:05:08.230> way<00:05:08.350> out

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530
