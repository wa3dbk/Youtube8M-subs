00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
alright let's see let's keep checking

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.340 
alright let's see let's keep checking
the<00:02:04.549> blocks<00:02:04.790> again<00:02:05.060> we<00:02:05.150> have<00:02:05.270> to<00:02:05.450> look<00:02:05.869> for<00:02:06.110> any

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
the blocks again we have to look for any

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.059 
the blocks again we have to look for any
any<00:02:06.740> sudden<00:02:07.310> movements<00:02:07.940> here<00:02:08.240> at<00:02:08.929> all<00:02:09.289> to<00:02:09.890> see

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
any sudden movements here at all to see

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.790 
any sudden movements here at all to see
if<00:02:10.160> we<00:02:10.280> can<00:02:10.399> see<00:02:10.610> any<00:02:10.789> blocks<00:02:11.300> -<00:02:12.230> as<00:02:12.380> well<00:02:12.560> I

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
if we can see any blocks - as well I

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.140 
if we can see any blocks - as well I
don't<00:02:12.980> think<00:02:13.160> anyone<00:02:13.520> will<00:02:13.610> get<00:02:13.760> up<00:02:13.819> there<00:02:13.970> but

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
don't think anyone will get up there but

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.150 
don't think anyone will get up there but
then<00:02:14.360> again<00:02:14.480> it's<00:02:14.930> very<00:02:15.140> hard<00:02:15.440> to<00:02:15.560> tell

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
then again it's very hard to tell

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.920 
then again it's very hard to tell
looks<00:02:16.400> like<00:02:16.520> someone's<00:02:16.819> chasing<00:02:17.090> a<00:02:17.330> block<00:02:17.630> now

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
looks like someone's chasing a block now

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.590 
looks like someone's chasing a block now
all<00:02:18.620> right<00:02:18.770> let's<00:02:19.610> look<00:02:19.819> let's<00:02:20.150> look<00:02:20.239> you

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.990 
all right let's look let's look you
someone<00:02:21.080> someone's<00:02:21.530> gonna<00:02:21.830> move<00:02:22.100> its<00:02:22.760> just

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
someone someone's gonna move its just

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.180 
someone someone's gonna move its just
bound<00:02:23.390> to<00:02:23.690> happen<00:02:23.870> either<00:02:24.290> they<00:02:24.440> accidentally

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
bound to happen either they accidentally

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.110 
bound to happen either they accidentally
move<00:02:25.430> or<00:02:25.730> something<00:02:27.340> and<00:02:28.340> I<00:02:28.430> wonder<00:02:28.910> if<00:02:29.000> they

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
move or something and I wonder if they

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.229 
move or something and I wonder if they
can<00:02:29.180> see<00:02:29.540> like<00:02:30.140> how<00:02:30.380> many<00:02:30.440> hearts<00:02:31.010> I<00:02:31.130> have<00:02:31.340> that

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
can see like how many hearts I have that

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.630 
can see like how many hearts I have that
would<00:02:32.420> not<00:02:32.750> be<00:02:32.959> good<00:02:33.170> if<00:02:33.319> they<00:02:33.440> could<00:02:33.640> because

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
would not be good if they could because

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.580 
would not be good if they could because
then<00:02:34.790> I<00:02:35.030> could<00:02:35.090> be<00:02:35.420> in<00:02:35.660> some<00:02:35.900> big<00:02:35.930> trouble<00:02:36.380> here

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
then I could be in some big trouble here

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:43.210 
then I could be in some big trouble here
I<00:02:37.750> know<00:02:38.750> no<00:02:39.230> one<00:02:39.470> no<00:02:40.370> one's<00:02:40.580> over<00:02:40.880> here<00:02:42.220> we're

no one's okay we checked out everything
in<00:02:47.480> this<00:02:47.780> spot<00:02:48.140> kind<00:02:48.680> of<00:02:48.890> it's<00:02:49.790> kind<00:02:49.970> of<00:02:50.000> hard

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
in this spot kind of it's kind of hard

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.660 
in this spot kind of it's kind of hard
to<00:02:50.269> tell<00:02:50.420> especially<00:02:50.959> the<00:02:51.080> map<00:02:51.400> it's<00:02:52.400> like

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
to tell especially the map it's like

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.880 
to tell especially the map it's like
like<00:02:53.300> they're<00:02:53.690> things<00:02:53.989> that<00:02:54.290> kind<00:02:54.500> of<00:02:54.620> blend

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
like they're things that kind of blend

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.250 
like they're things that kind of blend
in<00:02:55.040> almost<00:02:55.430> like<00:02:55.550> a<00:02:55.670> cave<00:02:55.970> so<00:02:56.720> this<00:02:56.900> is<00:02:57.050> also

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
in almost like a cave so this is also

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.170 
in almost like a cave so this is also
interesting<00:02:57.620> here<00:02:58.810> no<00:03:00.610> let's<00:03:01.610> see

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
interesting here no let's see

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.199 
interesting here no let's see
we<00:03:02.480> might<00:03:02.690> just<00:03:02.720> let's<00:03:03.200> just<00:03:03.290> let's<00:03:03.680> just<00:03:03.739> stay

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
we might just let's just let's just stay

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.070 
we might just let's just let's just stay
somewhere<00:03:05.209> and<00:03:05.420> then<00:03:05.540> what<00:03:05.690> we're<00:03:05.780> gonna<00:03:05.840> do

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
somewhere and then what we're gonna do

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.039 
somewhere and then what we're gonna do
is<00:03:06.260> when<00:03:06.890> I<00:03:06.920> try<00:03:07.190> and<00:03:07.370> wait<00:03:07.579> to<00:03:07.820> see<00:03:07.850> if<00:03:08.239> we<00:03:08.810> see

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049 
is when I try and wait to see if we see

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:14.880 
is when I try and wait to see if we see
anything<00:03:09.799> moving<00:03:10.549> at<00:03:10.970> all<00:03:11.480> I<00:03:11.780> mean<00:03:12.370> anything

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
anything moving at all I mean anything

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.229 
anything moving at all I mean anything
let's<00:03:15.890> be<00:03:16.010> careful<00:03:16.190> though<00:03:16.519> because<00:03:16.549> someone

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
let's be careful though because someone

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.840 
let's be careful though because someone
can<00:03:17.420> again<00:03:17.780> someone<00:03:18.230> can<00:03:18.410> take<00:03:18.560> me<00:03:18.739> out<00:03:18.769> if<00:03:19.220> I'm

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
can again someone can take me out if I'm

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.740 
can again someone can take me out if I'm
not<00:03:20.030> careful<00:03:21.340> like<00:03:22.340> especially<00:03:23.209> since<00:03:23.570> my

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
not careful like especially since my

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:25.630 
not careful like especially since my
hearts<00:03:24.049> are<00:03:24.200> pretty<00:03:24.380> low<00:03:24.620> they<00:03:25.310> can<00:03:25.340> just

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
hearts are pretty low they can just

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.069 
hearts are pretty low they can just
attack<00:03:25.910> me<00:03:25.940> maybe<00:03:26.269> about<00:03:26.510> a<00:03:26.570> good<00:03:26.810> two<00:03:27.049> or
