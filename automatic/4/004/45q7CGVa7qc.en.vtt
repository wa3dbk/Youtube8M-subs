00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
gameplay is really great so we'll jump

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.439 
gameplay is really great so we'll jump
into<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:56.160> level<00:00:56.399> here<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.640> this<00:00:56.910> is<00:00:56.969> the

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
into the level here and this is the

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.750 
into the level here and this is the
third<00:00:57.840> set<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.230> levels<00:00:58.379> so<00:00:59.129> these<00:00:59.280> start<00:00:59.640> to

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
third set of levels so these start to

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.189 
third set of levels so these start to
get<00:00:59.879> a<00:00:59.910> little<00:01:00.030> more<00:01:00.300> difficult<00:01:00.480> as<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:01.050> keep

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
get a little more difficult as you keep

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.650 
get a little more difficult as you keep
on<00:01:01.379> going<00:01:01.620> so<00:01:02.340> progress<00:01:02.820> is<00:01:03.000> really<00:01:03.270> well<00:01:03.420> and

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
on going so progress is really well and

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.770 
on going so progress is really well and
inside<00:01:04.140> each<00:01:04.379> level<00:01:04.860> set<00:01:05.100> each<00:01:05.970> level<00:01:06.510> becomes

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
inside each level set each level becomes

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.240 
inside each level set each level becomes
tougher<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.350> tougher<00:01:07.380> as<00:01:07.770> you<00:01:07.890> go<00:01:08.010> through

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
tougher and tougher as you go through

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.399 
tougher and tougher as you go through
them<00:01:08.450> so<00:01:09.450> on<00:01:09.510> this<00:01:09.659> one<00:01:09.840> we<00:01:09.990> have<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.229> ensure

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
them so on this one we have to ensure

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.609 
them so on this one we have to ensure
that<00:01:10.650> we<00:01:11.130> hit<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.960> bottom<00:01:12.960> ones<00:01:13.140> here<00:01:13.409> and

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
that we hit the bottom ones here and

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.190 
that we hit the bottom ones here and
break<00:01:13.860> these<00:01:14.070> bottom<00:01:14.610> platforms<00:01:15.270> before

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
break these bottom platforms before

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.740 
break these bottom platforms before
actually<00:01:16.680> dropping<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.460> aliens<00:01:18.270> enemies

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
actually dropping the aliens enemies

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.770 
actually dropping the aliens enemies
down<00:01:19.189> okay<00:01:20.189> so<00:01:20.250> now<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:20.549> got<00:01:20.790> those<00:01:21.000> cleared<00:01:21.390> so

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
down okay so now I got those cleared so

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.429 
down okay so now I got those cleared so
then<00:01:22.880> launch<00:01:23.880> one<00:01:24.150> here<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.659> break<00:01:24.840> this<00:01:25.170> one

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
then launch one here to break this one

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.060 
then launch one here to break this one
and<00:01:25.680> send<00:01:25.920> that<00:01:25.979> alien<00:01:26.490> down<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:26.939> oh<00:01:27.920> crap<00:01:28.920> I

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
and send that alien down and oh crap I

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.160 
and send that alien down and oh crap I
did<00:01:29.250> that<00:01:29.400> in<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.579> wrong<00:01:29.729> order<00:01:29.939> so<00:01:30.750> as<00:01:30.780> you

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
did that in the wrong order so as you

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.800 
did that in the wrong order so as you
see<00:01:31.350> this<00:01:31.560> game<00:01:31.770> really<00:01:32.070> does<00:01:32.369> make<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:32.670> think

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
see this game really does make you think

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.300 
see this game really does make you think
because<00:01:33.810> as<00:01:34.110> you<00:01:34.229> see<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:34.439> blocked<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.130> other

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
because as you see I blocked the other

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.100 
because as you see I blocked the other
enemy<00:01:35.790> so<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.030> can't<00:01:36.329> get<00:01:36.570> to<00:01:36.689> him<00:01:36.780> because<00:01:37.079> that

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
enemy so I can't get to him because that

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.410 
enemy so I can't get to him because that
board<00:01:37.470> falls<00:01:37.770> when<00:01:38.040> I<00:01:38.070> break<00:01:38.340> those<00:01:38.520> boards<00:01:38.850> so

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
board falls when I break those boards so

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.179 
board falls when I break those boards so
you<00:01:39.479> have<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.720> redo<00:01:39.990> them<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:41.040> can

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
you have to redo them and you can

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.130 
you have to redo them and you can
actually<00:01:41.369> view<00:01:41.759> solutions<00:01:42.360> if<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:42.780> have<00:01:42.960> any

always<00:01:53.280> use<00:01:53.430> those<00:01:53.670> two<00:01:54.409> so<00:01:55.409> it's<00:01:55.680> good<00:01:56.369> way

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
always use those two so it's good way

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.280 
always use those two so it's good way
for<00:01:56.549> them<00:01:56.759> to<00:01:56.880> make<00:01:57.119> money<00:01:57.360> but<00:01:57.600> you<00:01:57.869> probably

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
for them to make money but you probably

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.780 
for them to make money but you probably
just<00:01:58.469> go<00:01:58.619> online<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:59.070> find<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.430> answers

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
just go online and find the answers

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.190 
just go online and find the answers
instead<00:02:00.119> oh<00:02:00.450> crap<00:02:01.670> damn<00:02:02.670> it

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
instead oh crap damn it

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.780 
instead oh crap damn it
so<00:02:05.200> the<00:02:05.950> game<00:02:06.100> is<00:02:06.130> definitely<00:02:06.400> really

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
so the game is definitely really

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.910 
so the game is definitely really
challenging<00:02:07.450> but<00:02:08.110> that<00:02:08.319> makes<00:02:08.500> it<00:02:08.709> really

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
challenging but that makes it really

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.400 
challenging but that makes it really
enjoyable<00:02:09.429> and<00:02:09.640> you<00:02:10.600> actually<00:02:10.929> can<00:02:11.080> skip

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
enjoyable and you actually can skip

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.110 
enjoyable and you actually can skip
levels<00:02:11.650> two<00:02:12.010> and<00:02:12.040> you<00:02:12.250> can<00:02:12.400> use<00:02:12.550> up<00:02:12.730> the<00:02:12.850> three

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
levels two and you can use up the three

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.990 
levels two and you can use up the three
skips<00:02:13.540> in<00:02:13.810> addition<00:02:14.440> to<00:02:14.860> those<00:02:15.010> solutions<00:02:15.340> and

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
skips in addition to those solutions and

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.790 
skips in addition to those solutions and
there's<00:02:16.480> a<00:02:16.540> great<00:02:16.750> variety<00:02:16.959> of<00:02:17.140> gameplay<00:02:17.590> in

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
there's a great variety of gameplay in

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.920 
there's a great variety of gameplay in
the<00:02:17.890> game<00:02:18.069> a<00:02:18.280> lot<00:02:18.459> of<00:02:18.610> vertical<00:02:19.120> levels<00:02:19.750> and

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
the game a lot of vertical levels and

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.540 
the game a lot of vertical levels and
horizontal<00:02:20.440> levels<00:02:20.739> levels<00:02:21.190> we<00:02:21.310> have<00:02:21.459> to

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
horizontal levels levels we have to

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.220 
horizontal levels levels we have to
break<00:02:21.760> certain<00:02:22.150> things<00:02:22.360> in<00:02:22.600> different<00:02:22.810> orders

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
break certain things in different orders

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.070 
break certain things in different orders
and<00:02:23.580> the<00:02:24.580> controls<00:02:25.060> work<00:02:25.300> quite<00:02:25.630> well<00:02:25.660> and

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
and the controls work quite well and

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.110 
and the controls work quite well and
you're<00:02:26.890> given<00:02:27.190> a<00:02:27.250> good<00:02:27.430> amount<00:02:27.640> of<00:02:27.760> grenades

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
you're given a good amount of grenades

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.960 
you're given a good amount of grenades
so<00:02:28.690> that<00:02:28.959> you<00:02:29.860> actually<00:02:29.980> do<00:02:30.280> have<00:02:30.370> chances<00:02:30.910> to

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
so that you actually do have chances to

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.910 
so that you actually do have chances to
keep<00:02:31.270> on<00:02:31.420> retrying<00:02:31.900> things<00:02:32.230> you<00:02:32.560> can<00:02:32.709> kill

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
keep on retrying things you can kill

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.710 
keep on retrying things you can kill
enemies<00:02:33.220> just<00:02:33.370> by<00:02:33.580> dropping<00:02:33.850> them<00:02:34.209> down<00:02:34.450> like

more than angry birds does this level is
more<00:02:49.269> just<00:02:49.450> one<00:02:49.660> of<00:02:49.810> the<00:02:49.930> accuracy<00:02:50.739> levels<00:02:51.100> has

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
more just one of the accuracy levels has

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.160 
more just one of the accuracy levels has
less<00:02:51.610> thinking<00:02:52.150> in<00:02:52.269> it<00:02:54.600> still<00:02:55.600> is<00:02:55.810> quite

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170

really great game and this is one of the
more<00:03:29.350> challenging<00:03:29.410> ones<00:03:30.040> too<00:03:30.359> there's<00:03:31.359> as<00:03:31.750> you

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
more challenging ones too there's as you

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:33.479 
more challenging ones too there's as you
saw<00:03:32.230> these<00:03:32.500> little<00:03:32.769> things<00:03:32.799> that<00:03:33.160> they'll

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
saw these little things that they'll

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.210 
saw these little things that they'll
shoot<00:03:34.390> off<00:03:34.600> in<00:03:34.810> certain<00:03:35.140> directions<00:03:35.260> so<00:03:36.040> those

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
shoot off in certain directions so those

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.280 
shoot off in certain directions so those
change<00:03:36.609> up<00:03:36.760> the<00:03:36.880> game<00:03:37.060> place<00:03:37.359> on<00:03:37.600> the

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
change up the game place on the

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.090 
change up the game place on the
breakable<00:03:38.829> walls<00:03:39.070> of<00:03:39.489> course<00:03:39.850> and<00:03:40.620> I<00:03:41.620> probably

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
breakable walls of course and I probably

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.400 
breakable walls of course and I probably
have<00:03:42.370> to<00:03:42.519> shoot<00:03:42.790> something<00:03:43.090> up<00:03:43.329> here<00:03:43.690> and<00:03:43.900> if

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
have to shoot something up here and if

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.319 
have to shoot something up here and if
you<00:03:44.530> do<00:03:44.739> need<00:03:44.890> it<00:03:45.070> get<00:03:45.430> more<00:03:45.640> accuracy<00:03:46.060> when

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329 
you do need it get more accuracy when

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:48.180 
you do need it get more accuracy when
Amy<00:03:46.510> you<00:03:46.720> can<00:03:46.870> just<00:03:47.049> tap<00:03:47.230> another<00:03:47.620> finger<00:03:48.040> down

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
Amy you can just tap another finger down

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.150 
Amy you can just tap another finger down
and<00:03:48.489> then<00:03:49.299> release<00:03:49.780> both<00:03:50.109> of<00:03:50.350> those<00:03:50.500> to<00:03:50.859> shoot

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
and then release both of those to shoot

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.900 
and then release both of those to shoot
so<00:03:52.030> that<00:03:52.299> will<00:03:52.390> help<00:03:52.450> you<00:03:52.780> out<00:03:52.959> a<00:03:52.989> little<00:03:53.290> and

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
so that will help you out a little and

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.509 
so that will help you out a little and
then<00:03:55.470> we'll<00:03:56.470> have<00:03:56.590> to<00:03:56.709> throw<00:03:56.950> another<00:03:57.160> one<00:03:57.340> up
