game that being said though let's go

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.440 
game that being said though let's go
from<00:00:31.830> left<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.130> right<00:00:32.219> here<00:00:32.610> let's<00:00:32.759> talk<00:00:33.300> about

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
from left to right here let's talk about

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.870 
from left to right here let's talk about
what<00:00:33.780> I<00:00:33.809> exactly<00:00:34.260> i'm<00:00:34.380> using<00:00:34.739> here<00:00:34.880> obviously

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
what I exactly i'm using here obviously

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.370 
what I exactly i'm using here obviously
you<00:00:35.969> see<00:00:36.149> right<00:00:36.300> here<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.780> first<00:00:37.020> power<00:00:37.260> is

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
you see right here the first power is

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.920 
you see right here the first power is
detonate<00:00:38.340> detonate<00:00:38.850> is<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.090> very<00:00:39.420> hard-hitting

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
detonate detonate is a very hard-hitting

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.709 
detonate detonate is a very hard-hitting
single<00:00:40.469> target<00:00:40.800> power<00:00:41.239> probably<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.329> hardest

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
single target power probably the hardest

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.100 
single target power probably the hardest
one<00:00:42.899> that<00:00:43.020> fire<00:00:43.170> has<00:00:44.510> next<00:00:45.510> to<00:00:45.629> snuff<00:00:45.930> out

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
one that fire has next to snuff out

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.529 
one that fire has next to snuff out
which<00:00:46.440> is<00:00:46.469> no<00:00:46.950> thirty<00:00:47.190> five<00:00:47.370> percenter<00:00:47.760> but

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
which is no thirty five percenter but

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.810 
which is no thirty five percenter but
you<00:00:48.930> know<00:00:49.020> in<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.410> meantime<00:00:49.559> detonate<00:00:50.430> hits

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
you know in the meantime detonate hits

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.939 
you know in the meantime detonate hits
like<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.030> beast<00:00:51.329> man<00:00:51.660> i<00:00:51.690> highly<00:00:52.500> recommend<00:00:52.920> you
