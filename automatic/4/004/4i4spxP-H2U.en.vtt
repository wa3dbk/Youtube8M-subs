00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.350 
cape the next thing to look at is a UPF
factor<00:00:54.629> this<00:00:55.140> is<00:00:55.350> like<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.890> SPF<00:00:56.610> factor<00:00:57.000> that

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
factor this is like the SPF factor that

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.060 
factor this is like the SPF factor that
you<00:00:57.480> see<00:00:57.690> on<00:00:57.870> sunscreen<00:00:58.350> but<00:00:58.800> it's<00:00:58.920> the

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
you see on sunscreen but it's the

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.799 
you see on sunscreen but it's the
clothing<00:00:59.610> equivalent<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:02.120> generally<00:01:03.120> the

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
clothing equivalent and generally the

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.020 
clothing equivalent and generally the
highest<00:01:04.229> that<00:01:04.379> they<00:01:04.530> rate<00:01:04.710> things<00:01:04.979> is<00:01:05.129> 50-plus

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
highest that they rate things is 50-plus

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.649 
highest that they rate things is 50-plus
so<00:01:06.889> all<00:01:07.889> the<00:01:08.279> Sun<00:01:08.490> hats<00:01:08.729> we<00:01:08.969> tested<00:01:09.420> we're<00:01:09.569> in

put all the different UPF ratings
side-by-side<00:01:19.950> next<00:01:20.880> is<00:01:20.999> ventilation<00:01:21.719> most<00:01:22.619> of

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
side-by-side next is ventilation most of

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.620 
side-by-side next is ventilation most of
the<00:01:22.859> hats<00:01:23.069> have<00:01:23.459> some<00:01:23.999> type<00:01:24.240> of<00:01:24.389> ventilation

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
the hats have some type of ventilation

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.830 
the hats have some type of ventilation
on<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.109> sides<00:01:25.380> but<00:01:26.039> how<00:01:26.670> they<00:01:26.880> ventilate<00:01:27.359> will

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
on the sides but how they ventilate will

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.459 
on the sides but how they ventilate will
depend<00:01:28.200> on<00:01:28.439> what<00:01:28.799> that<00:01:29.009> material<00:01:29.219> is<00:01:29.759> how

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:30.469 
depend on what that material is how

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:33.709 
depend on what that material is how
spaced<00:01:31.469> out<00:01:31.649> those<00:01:31.829> holes<00:01:32.039> are<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.549> this<00:01:33.509> is

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:33.719 
spaced out those holes are and this is

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:37.159 
spaced out those holes are and this is
where<00:01:33.929> a<00:01:33.959> cape<00:01:34.669> actually<00:01:35.669> can<00:01:36.359> come<00:01:36.779> and<00:01:36.959> work

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:37.169 
where a cape actually can come and work

00:01:37.169 --> 00:01:39.260 
where a cape actually can come and work
against<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.770> little<00:01:38.099> for<00:01:38.549> example

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
against you a little for example

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.870 
against you a little for example
the<00:01:40.229> Cape<00:01:40.439> on<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.799> Sun<00:01:41.039> runner<00:01:41.279> it<00:01:41.520> comes<00:01:41.729> down

the Cape on the Sun runner it comes down

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.839 
the Cape on the Sun runner it comes down
