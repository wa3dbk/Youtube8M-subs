00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
invisible for like five seconds or

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.150 
invisible for like five seconds or
something<00:03:45.880> and<00:03:46.230> can<00:03:47.230> they<00:03:47.320> shoot<00:03:47.380> I<00:03:47.739> don't

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
something and can they shoot I don't

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.100 
something and can they shoot I don't
remember<00:03:48.730> now<00:03:49.450> you<00:03:49.510> can't<00:03:49.780> shoot<00:03:49.900> by

remember now you can't shoot by

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:51.780 
remember now you can't shoot by
invisible<00:03:50.440> I<00:03:50.890> think<00:03:51.220> that<00:03:51.340> would<00:03:51.400> be<00:03:51.520> a<00:03:51.550> little

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
invisible I think that would be a little

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.470 
invisible I think that would be a little
over<00:03:52.000> fabric<00:03:52.180> yeah<00:03:52.720> but<00:03:53.590> uh<00:03:53.980> it<00:03:54.550> still<00:03:55.270> it

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
over fabric yeah but uh it still it

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.330 
over fabric yeah but uh it still it
still<00:03:55.690> allows<00:03:56.080> you<00:03:56.260> to<00:03:56.380> like<00:03:56.500> escape<00:03:57.070> if

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
still allows you to like escape if

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.660 
still allows you to like escape if
you're<00:03:57.520> like<00:03:57.790> in<00:03:58.030> trouble<00:03:58.660> or<00:03:58.750> whatever<00:03:58.989> but

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
you're like in trouble or whatever but

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.170 
you're like in trouble or whatever but
