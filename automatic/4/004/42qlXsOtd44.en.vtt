00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:02.820
 steering 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.240
 that may happen but I think the topic certainly place 

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.429
 the game with the group 

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:12.259
 Beginners find it particularly difficult 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:15.259
 why actually 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.240
 in the driving school have learned but many know the new technology even 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.060
 not so easy to use and therefore does not come so with the clutch 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.039
 especially good 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.800
 Despite technical advancements, the principle of the clutch is still 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.720
 the same 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.060
 on older cars, we can see very well how a clutch works 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.370
 where it actually is shows art becomes schürholz 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.290
 here in the form of already seats 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.210
 Power tools generate this force with unfolded over the gearbox 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.150
 Rear axle and then on the wheels 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.600
 Between engine and play drums, the art loosens India also the clutch 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.150
 is constructed 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:54.990
 Here is the clutch 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.140
 what the outlook on the activity and the sophisticated technology Opel 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.020
 This will cause the clutch pedal to open as the clutch costs us 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:06.780
 logically every point knows 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.280
 either transmits a cable or as here in the animation 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.150
 a hydraulic system may have the power to post glue in the focus 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.980
 the exit ever oppressed against a so-called Taylor spring therefore the 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.360
 Resistance when pedaling the pedal pin 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.850
 Here the motor sits often done 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.830
 the power is transmitted via the clutch to the transmission 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.520
 the gear is sitting here 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.070
 The clutch sits in her neck loose 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.840
 by closing the pedal with the clutch closed or disconnected 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.360
 in order to get to the clutch, the gearbox must be removed 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.520
 In the meantime, we are going to answer the question 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.520
 whether you want a car up without testing 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.149
 without clutch we have to start with pickled the first ladies 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.149
 if that's the reason for the it-market 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.210
 the car actually starts but without a clutch we had to 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.590
 always drive at first gear or force in the long run certainly no 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.590
 quality 

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:14.329
 Back in the mountain town the clutch is tucked between engine and 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:15.070
 transmission 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.070
 The expansion is correspondingly tedious and expensive 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:27.750
 inside the clutch is apparently turn left it's going to the engine 

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:28.329
 right 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:31.319
 Switch to get Republican 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.989
 When installed, the clutch disc is firmly planned and rotates 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.639
 with that means the power is left from the engine to over the clutch too 

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:42.639
 Operations right transfer the car is located 

00:02:44.929 --> 00:02:48.279
 Now, like the clutch, the disc no longer rotates with the clutch 

00:02:48.279 --> 00:02:51.659
 Force flow test subjected 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:55.900
 Gudrun Schlegel are a composites spending fiberglass graphite and copper 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.349
 Taken in hard and usually holding rubber looks like a car life 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:01.269
 long 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:05.599
 the small springs in the disc are so-called «Too Sions dampers 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:09.709
 they compensate for vibrations and thus reduce the gear rattling 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:19.199
 modern functions with automatic wears compensate consist of up 

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:22.199
 to 75 the different parts 

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:30.619
 Whether a clutch is worn or not, anyone can easily check 

00:03:31.779 --> 00:03:36.879
 engage second gear Pull handbrake Press clutch and start the engine 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:43.019
 when the clutch pedal will come Peter Wagenhaus works 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:44.549
 Clutch remains the hand 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:47.549
 she must be renewed 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.269
 In this car, the clutch works wonders just how long 

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:56.439
 because really acute like Walk the forbidden he leaves the clutch 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:59.889
 Loops and indeed 

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:03.459
 our trial simulated time lapse the wrong use of a clutch 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.949
 If you let the coupling too often and too long loops it is faster 

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:11.109
 Forgive as one believes 

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:14.109
 our receipts are down after seven minutes 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.370
 we want to see what's left of the disc 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.370
 but the lid does not bode well 

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:29.100
 Behind us follow the remains of the coupon lining against hot ashes 

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:32.099
 more is not possible 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:39.919
 Bookings can even explode under extreme stress 

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:43.770
 so happened in this acceleration race 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.460
 Sunday's first start at the start went well, according to Puma 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.710
 I started my first first 200 runs 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.710
 terrible bang 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.400
 that with new buildings formulation the clutch flew out 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.909
 but what really hard 

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:06.330
 Here again in slow motion at 9000 revolutions split clutch and 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:07.289
 Clutch stop 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:09.219
 in a thousand parts 

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:12.219
 so in the interior or 50 books not a faster one here 

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:16.629
 of course the caravelle on sheet drifts has come off and on 2 

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:19.879
 0 beaten but in the large lecture hall with luck had that all well 

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:23.180
 but there are people there as the feet complained 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:27.639
 Extreme loads can destroy the clutch, but what can we do? 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:29.860
 to last a long time 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.780
 Do not overload the car every kilogram more than necessary loads the 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.309
 clutch 

00:05:36.309 --> 00:05:37.719
 there 

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:42.559
 Do not rest your foot on the clutch pedal while driving 

00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:46.360
 otherwise the disc always remains light with thost of pedal 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:50.750
 I love him the lower the speed when engaging the longer the holds 

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:51.759
 Coupling to 

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:55.060
 go daily that also applies to the switch when you switch back 

00:05:55.059 --> 00:05:58.490
 Skip gears must balance the clutch high speed differences 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.909
 around the wear faster 

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:05.699
 Teenagers and not waiting on a slope with loops of clutch 

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:09.449
 but use the brake then it works long with the start 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:16.280
 this deficiency is a cloud Armin Schwarz training to the bastion 

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.620
 Californians are both aware of each other
