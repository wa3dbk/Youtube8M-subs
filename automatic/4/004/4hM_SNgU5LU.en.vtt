really well let's see and the foundation
is<00:03:57.959> kind<00:03:58.200> of<00:03:58.290> staying<00:04:00.050> concentrated<00:04:01.050> in<00:04:01.170> the

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
is kind of staying concentrated in the

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.930 
is kind of staying concentrated in the
area<00:04:01.530> that<00:04:01.650> I<00:04:01.709> like<00:04:01.950> to<00:04:02.100> put<00:04:02.310> this<00:04:02.430> stripe<00:04:02.730> of

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
area that I like to put this stripe of

it down on and it's very hard for me to

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.920 
it down on and it's very hard for me to
kind<00:04:05.100> of<00:04:05.250> blend<00:04:05.640> it<00:04:05.820> out<00:04:06.000> further<00:04:06.420> to<00:04:06.570> rest<00:04:06.810> on

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
kind of blend it out further to rest on

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:08.090 
kind of blend it out further to rest on
my<00:04:06.989> face<00:04:07.170> because<00:04:07.290> I<00:04:07.470> can<00:04:07.590> kind<00:04:07.800> of<00:04:07.860> see<00:04:08.070> a

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
my face because I can kind of see a

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.470 
my face because I can kind of see a
