00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.440
 hello, welcome, I'm a teacher 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.930
 manoel viana I'm here for today 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.670
 discuss with you one more question of 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.400
 math test of the selective process 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.170
 simplified for teachers in the secretariat 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.820
 of education in the state of sÃ£o paulo 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.260
 but it's a test that was done in the year 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.029
 2012 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.980
 the issue that we are going to discuss today 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.830
 question number 31 of that proof that 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.810
 says the following in a city at height 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.640
 maximum tide and if the short occurred 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.099
 exactly at 12 o'clock 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.080
 the height of the sea water in this city is 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.030
 a periodic function because it oscillates 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.120
 regularly between high tide and tide 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.149
 the height of the tide increases. 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.739
 until the maximum tide is reached and 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.800
 decreases until it reaches the 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.050
 low tide to increase 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.920
 back to high tide and so on. 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.890
 against 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.699
 the height h in meters of the tide 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:56.850
 that day at the port of the city can be 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:01:01.980
 obtained approximately by the sentence ht 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:05.549
 water 2.5 plus 1.50 bi on 4t being 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.630
 the time elapsed in hours after the 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.770
 12 hours 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:13.619
 so the tide h is at 4 o'clock or 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:18.450
 either when it has equal to four hours 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:21.360
 It's good here is the high tide occurred 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.490
 exactly at 12 o'clock and from there on 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.090
 download this he wants to know the 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.159
 What is the height of this one? 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.420
 wave is the tide sorry for the height 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.049
 the tide 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:37.020
 at 4 o'clock in the afternoon or four o'clock 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.610
 after yellow occurred 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.490
 So we'll do whatever we want. 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.950
 function and replaced the time with four 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.509
 so it will be very simple right? 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:50.490
 so I made gattei dose is the 2.5 plus 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:54.060
 1.5 times advice team over four 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:57.899
 times replacing you have by 4h four 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:01.049
 2.5 plus 1.5 times the board of 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:04.950
 pi about four times 4 over four 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:09.599
 simplified times frame here is 44 I go 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:12.060
 be h4 equal to 2.5 plus 1.5 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.770
 times itch peak county 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.750
 everybody everyone 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.340
 You know, you mean, everyone should. 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.500
 know at least everyone who is 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.570
 math teacher knows that 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:27.780
 dipp advice is minus one 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:32.790
 then ht h4 is equal to 2.5 plus 1.5 times 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:36.810
 less 1.5 times minus one is less 1.5 and 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:39.720
 then just make 2.5 minus 1.5 which is 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.690
 equal to a charge of four or 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:46.080
 4:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.480
 the tide height of one meter can mark 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.960
 then as the correct alternative to 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:54.750
 alternative and, of course, 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:57.690
 Simple, but I'm here. 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.550
 my suggestion of resolution for each 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.080
 one of these issues that remains open 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.930
 so that my colleagues 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:06.180
 put your suggestions your points of 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.660
 views that make their comments will be 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.490
 always very welcome and will help 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.740
 other of our colleagues are 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:16.020
 studying presidency for football 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.670
 I hope you have tanned and 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.709
 promised to come back soon with other 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.820
 issues resolved and commented on 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.820
 you a hug and see you there
