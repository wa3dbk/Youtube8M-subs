00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
server i would actually just add it and

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:27.980 
server i would actually just add it and
then<00:01:26.549> what<00:01:26.790> I<00:01:26.820> would<00:01:26.970> do<00:01:27.210> with<00:01:27.360> this<00:01:27.390> screen<00:01:27.840> is

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
need the FTP address and then you would

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.649

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
that that pretty much is it but let's

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.980 
that that pretty much is it but let's
take<00:01:38.220> a<00:01:38.250> look<00:01:38.460> at<00:01:38.520> this<00:01:38.700> one<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.210> if<00:01:39.659> I<00:01:39.750> wanted

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
take a look at this one and if I wanted

take a look at this one and if I wanted
to<00:01:40.049> come<00:01:40.320> in<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.740> could<00:01:41.280> edit<00:01:41.490> this<00:01:41.659> for<00:01:42.659> my<00:01:42.780> root

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
to come in I could edit this for my root

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.030 
to come in I could edit this for my root

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
does I'm not going to do it we could

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.620 
does I'm not going to do it we could
also<00:04:35.530> hit<00:04:35.949> put<00:04:36.220> files<00:04:36.490> for<00:04:36.850> remote<00:04:37.060> server<00:04:37.360> and

also hit put files for remote server and

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.450 
also hit put files for remote server and
then<00:04:38.139> what<00:04:38.260> happens<00:04:38.590> once<00:04:38.710> we<00:04:38.919> do<00:04:39.040> that<00:04:39.070> our

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
then what happens once we do that our

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.060 
then what happens once we do that our
sites<00:04:40.090> are<00:04:40.389> live<00:04:40.680> so<00:04:41.680> the<00:04:41.800> important

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
sites are live so the important

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.340 
sites are live so the important
information<00:04:42.250> is<00:04:42.850> our<00:04:43.180> username<00:04:43.810> and<00:04:44.229> our

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:44.350 
information is our username and our

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.620 
information is our username and our
password<00:04:44.889> and<00:04:45.190> we<00:04:45.850> can<00:04:45.970> look<00:04:46.090> at<00:04:46.210> we<00:04:46.330> could<00:04:46.479> do

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
password and we can look at we could do

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.300 
password and we can look at we could do
it<00:04:46.780> right<00:04:46.900> directly<00:04:47.680> through<00:04:47.979> our<00:04:48.070> files

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
it right directly through our files

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.300 
it right directly through our files
panel<00:04:48.729> and<00:04:49.120> Dreamweaver<00:04:49.630> or<00:04:50.139> we<00:04:50.320> can<00:04:50.530> go<00:04:50.710> right

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
panel and Dreamweaver or we can go right

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.330 
panel and Dreamweaver or we can go right
to<00:04:51.550> our<00:04:51.580> hosting<00:04:52.240> and<00:04:52.479> upload<00:04:53.440> our<00:04:53.680> files<00:04:54.010> that

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
to our hosting and upload our files that

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.120 
to our hosting and upload our files that
way<00:04:54.490> probably<00:04:54.850> I<00:04:55.419> find<00:04:56.260> that<00:04:56.410> it's<00:04:56.560> easiest<00:04:56.919> to

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
way probably I find that it's easiest to

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.879 
way probably I find that it's easiest to
do<00:04:57.340> it<00:04:57.490> through<00:04:58.060> my<00:04:58.540> files<00:04:58.870> manager<00:04:59.530> to<00:04:59.770> my
